I want her to know her heritage. Grace Lin and Roseanne Thong have created many terrific books that let me share with my daughter about Asian families and how they celebrate and most importantly how color plays such a vital role in the Asians eyes and lifestyles.    I love that Grace lin included dragon dancing and put feet under it for your child to see. I am trying to show my daughter that the Dragons used in Dragon Dances for the Chinese New Year is not a \\"live\\" dragon, but that there are many people or one person underneath and that they are wearing a dragon costume. Just like my daughter wheres a costume at Halloween. And then maybe this year she won't cry... or maybe not as much... she's only 2 1/2 years old.     I love that the book introduces us to the Chinese culture and how they eat different foods and instead of using forks, knives and spoons they use chopsticks! I love that one of the last lines in the book prompts your child to see what colors are around them, be it in their homes, backyards and else where. I also love that there are definations of certain words that we might be unfamiliar with. No matter if you live in America, Australia, Canada or Neatherlands or anywhere that Asains have found a place to call home, this book will help you open your child & families lives & eyed to how Asians live.     There are may terrific books by Grace Lin and Toseanne Thong, here's to many, many more books to come in the future!!!!!	2005-10-09

No longer will she be your sole focus. The book has lots of netural colors,and there are beautiful photos of mom's, daughters, babies and toddlers. There are lots of sentences with fill in the blanks to make this book taylor made for your daughter to make her own. Because of the photos I think this is more for girls then boys. Maybe some day down the road the author will make a book for boys and maybe even a book for children who are getting a sibling through adoption.  <br /> <br />This book will help your child know that they are still special to you now & for always. A book they can go back to time and time again helping them processing everything that is going on to them, their mother and the newest member of their family.  <br /> <br />This book starts out taking about how our family is having a baby and how this book is special and just for she... Mommy's tiny big girl. It has a space for a current family photo. The book then moves on to talk about when they where born, how much they weighed, how many inches long you where and what things you liked to do as a baby. There is space for your child to add a photo of the two of you or if your child is old enough to draw a photos or drawings that can be pasted to that page. There is even a page for the new babies' ultrasound photo. It then goes on to talk about how big your mommy is going to get and how different your mommy will look. It then talks about how mommy will back a bag & will go to the hospital.It also tells your child that the doctors & nurses will take care of your mommy and new baby. As well as who you will stay with and what fun things you might do while you are together.  It talks about how you will be able to visit and meet your new sister or brother with a space for a  your siblings photo. What is also cute is a page where you talk about a name for the new baby and if your child had a chance to name the baby what she'd name her or him.The last several pages talks about what a baby does and there is a space for a photo of your daughter and her new sibling. <br /> <br />This is such a smart and wonderful book! A perfect shower gift for anyone who has a daughter. And here's hoping that the author will also creating a book for boys, and another for siblings who are getting a sibling through adoption.	2005-10-09

This is how the book breaks down. Each page also has it's very own music track. The music is absolutely beautiful and is unlike any Chinese music cd that we own! The more we listen to this cd we really love it! My daughter actually requests to hear certain songs, our favorite has sounds like running horses!    CD -   Great Wall of China - The Chinese Dragon  The book and music speaks of how on Chinese New Year there is a big dragon dance to celebrate the New Year. It talks about how Chinese drums & cymbals give you a feeling of happiness. \\" This Asian adaptation of music that is played during festive occasions\\".    Silk Road  It's music has foot bells and a tambourine in this original composition.     Inner Mongolia  This track is suppose to make you feel like you are racing across the plains on horseback and uses traditional Mongolain music with a horse head fiddle. ( It's doesn't look like a horse head at all. Imagine a square guitar with a long neck and curved handle like a cane).     XinJiang   This track has an instrument called a Rawap and is suppose to convay a young Uyghur girl dancing during a festive occasion. there is a small drawing of what a Rawap looks like as well as other instruments in other songs.    Tibet  This track has banjo, Tibetan drums and a bamboo flute and is supposed to make you think of children celebrating.    Sichuan  This melody is an updated folk music and it has a Bawu which is a type of Chinese clarinet.     Guizhou  \\" Maioa people relay messages, including expressions of friendship and love, to each other through song. These songs echo through the mountain ranges. A Miao girl plays the Lusheng\\" instrument.    Guilin  This track features a copper drum in the background and is suppose to take you to a woman who is picking tea leaves in the spring morning sun.Yunnan  \\" The bamboo dance is a popular dance among the minority tribes of Yunnan. Dances move deftly between bamboo poles accompanied by the rhythmic beats of copper and wooden drums\\".    Dongbei  The main instrucments in this track are Chinese drums, cymbols, erhu and banhu. This track is known as Yang Ge and is played in parades during festive celebrations where thousands of people line up to watch the parades.     Central Plains  The bamboo flute in this track imitates a singing bird and also includes an instrument called a Pipa. It is suppose to make you think a grandfather laying under a big shade tree playing his flute while his grandson chases a small bird around the tree.    Jiangnan  This track is a new version of a 200-year-old Jiangnan folk song called Jasmine Flower. The song uses the Erhu which is kinda like a violin and the Pipa. Jasmine flowers are small and white and have the sweetest scent. You are suppose to imagine sitting in a boat on the canal in Zhouzhuang.      The information in this book is unbelieveable and combined with the cd makes this set a must have for anyone who loves China! Defiantely worth adding to your home library!	2005-10-09

This is a story about a Mama duck and her 4 children which includeds 3 that are ducklings and one who is a crocodile. You see, one day while Mama was sitting on her nest reading a book another egg rolled into her nest and Mama didn't even notice... it must have been a really good book and so the story begins and ends on a lovely note surrounded by is Mama and 3 sibling ducks.    Author & illustrator Chih-Yuan Chen wrote:  \\" This story was inspired by a friends of mine. My friend is American. but of Korean ancestry. He was adopted as a baby by a non-Korean family, and he sometimes felt a bit isolated and alone, growing up in a communnity where he was noticeably \\"different\\" looking. The same thing happens in Taiwan, too. It is my hope that the children from all over the work can learn to accept different people and things, and see the world with broader views and minds. The birth of every single child is a miracle, worthy of our respect!\\"    Wow, not only is this a terrific book, but after reading the above on the back of the dust jacket, Chih-Yuan Chen now has a new admirer happily waiting for his next terrific books! This is just one of those book that everyone should have a well worn & beloved copy in their home!	2005-09-20

From the moment you open this book you will be pleasently surprised, you'll notice that this book is read from top to bottom. And from that first page you get to read the full poem from start to finish first before even lifting a page. <br /> <br />The pages are made from rice paper as well and the illustrations from simply tearing  paper and paint. If your like me, your hands will imediately go to each page expecting to feel that soft texture threads that rice paper has,  or the texture of thick quick strokes of paint and then being sadly disappointed when you feel regular plain old paper pages. The rainbow of colors used are bright and so very rich!   <br /> <br />I love that the last two page show the Chinese characters both ancient & modern  characters  side by side so you can see how the characters changed from then to now. The Chinese characters are mountain peaks, tree, east, water, rain, river, boulder, through, sun, moon, many plants, metal, rice, hanging grain, ice, bamboo, hanging leaves, leek, fruit on a vine, hemp, west, salt, wine, jade, kindgon, center or middle and fire.  <br /> <br />I also love that in the middle of the author's notes inside a light pink circle in the middle of the page are thesewise and beautiful words.... <br /> <br />Be open to inspriation, <br />Inspiration leads to creativity. <br /> <br />Be open to play. <br />In play we see mistakes <br />as stepping-stones to fulfillment. <br /> <br />Be open to challenges, <br />Challenges offer us a chance to grow, <br /> <br />Be open to work. <br />It is in the willingness to labor <br />that we mature <br />and find excellence.	2005-09-20

There are several things I really like about this very unique book at an old traditional game called mahjong. <br /> <br />The first is that not only is this book written in English, but also has lots of Chinese Characters. Not only do they have the characters for Daddy, Mama, Big sister,  Little brother and Mahjong, but also word associated with the game such as \\" Hu Le!\\" ( I win! ),  \\" Peng \\" ( 3 of a kind ), \\" Chi\\" ( 3 in a row ), counting in Chinese from 1 to 10 and Do you want this tile? And your typical pestering of siblings ... Sounds terrible, Don't touch, and Don't act crazy!  <br /> <br />The second is that instead of drawing illustrations on paper, Beth who is a ceramic arts professor made the illustrations on ceramic plates. How cool is that!  The drawings are simple, colorful and have qualities that can and are found in families across the world! Upon 1st reading and looking at the books illusrations I thought, they are Ok, nothing really special, then upon reading the dust jacket I found out that illustrations where actually glazed & fired plates. With that in mind, I went back and carefully looked at each plate and was really impressed!  Now,I can easily see those plates now hang proudly on the walls in their parents home! <br /> <br />The third is that in the last 2 pages there is more information about Mahjong, and if you are interested in learning mahjong from reading this book ( like I now am), they have thoughtfully complied a list of 9 books on Mahjong for you to read. <br /> <br />The fourth is that the two sister when as young sat on their fathers knee and watched their parents and family members play mahjong and now they too play mahjong with their families. What a lovely way to pass on a family tradition and beloved game.	2005-09-20

Ten adorable & different baby animals are all sleeping in a den when a small little mouse says \\" Roll over\\". Each little animal rolls over and out of the soft den to the bottom of a hill under a shady tree until the little mouse is all alone and rolls her or himself down the hill to be with her/his sleeping friends.What is also nice is that as each animal rolls down the hill they do so in ryhme. We are also starting to learn Chinese so we are also counting in Chinese as each animal rolls to the bottom.     I don't know how John Butler does it but the baby animals he draws look so soft and fluffy that you can't help but each out and touch the animals hoping to feel each and every adorable animal! and you just can't beat a book that can be either read or sung AND reinforces counting from 10 to 1! Definately worthy of being a 10* book!	2005-09-20

And even though my daughter is only 32 months old she already asks for this book by name! It's such a simple concept... no matter what you do, your parents love you. It is so important that children know this. Their actions might not be the best but that does not change a parents love for their child. <br /> <br />I love the how each page is just focused on the Mama and her daughter & doll, that the artist choose just to have them alone on the page. I also like seeing different cultures and how they live, I think it is important for our children to see how other children live. <br /> <br />My favorite pages are the last several ones... \\" What if I turned into a olar bear, and I was the meanest bear you ever saw and I had sharp, sharp teeth, and I chased you into your tentand you cried? Then I would be very surprised and very scared. But still, inside the bear you would be you, and I would love you. I will love you, forever and for always, because you are my Dear One.	2005-09-03

I too have a daughter from China which I love dearly and would move the moon and stars to keep her safe and among our family. I would hope to be every bit as strong as the fictional Mom - Allison Turk. <br /> <br /> If you are in the midst of adoption, please do not let this book stop you, it is a work of fiction and a suspenseful read at that. Another reader reviewed this book and said that the author makes those of us who adopt from Peoples' Republic of China look desperate... I cannot disagree more.	2005-08-08

I had orignally purchased this book for my daughter and surprisingly finished the book in 2 days. <br />I main character Oyuna is very likeable, is a strong young woman despite of her crushed leg. She is a true horse whisper and chooses a remarkable horse that takes her on an incredable journey! I also like how the story takes place in a stable, with Oyuna being a happy grandmother who is passing on her story, love for horses and heritage on to her young granddaughter.  <br /> <br />Definately a wonderful read for your daughter, regardless to whether she is from China or not! Not to be a spoiler, but keep a box of kleenex close by for the last chapter!	2005-07-14

I often give these 2 books when I attend baby showers. Both are wonderful and so very important for growing up and even when you are already grown-up. <br /> <br />We're Different, We're the Same and We're All Wonderful show despite all of our vast difference, we are so alike! We all have beating heart, have hopes and dreams for our future, we all laugh and smile the same even though we may speak different languages. When cut we all bleed the same red blood. We need to remember that even though we look different, we are all very much the same. If we all start and teach our children that just because we are diffent looking or speak a different language that one of us is better than the other.	2005-07-14

The photos in this book are absolutely amazing! Starting with Hua Mei's 1st teeny tiny black & white photo camera that had been installed inside the panda den, and the book ending 1 year later. I can't say enough about the photos!     This is the 1st year in the life of Hua Mei and is pronounced Hwa May. In China, one name can mean different thing and Hua Mei's means Splended Beauty AND China-USA.  The birth of Hua Mei in 1999 in the San Diego Zoo connects both China, the country where pandas roam and here in the Us where she lives.     This is one of those books that grows with it's young reader! The author Joanne Ryder lots of information on each page.

The author also did the photos and what makes this book stand out among the other Chinese ABC books is that the photos are not the glossy touristy looking photos of wealthy families and places like the Imperial or Summer palace. But instead the photos of China's people doing their day to day things. The author states that the photos where taken in Guangxi, Yunnan & Shanxi. He wanted to show that the Chinese People are hard working, they have a strong commitment to their families, religion, history, customs both modern and traditional and their hope for the future. Each photo has on the right side of the page the Chinese character for the photo each letter represents. I would have like to have seen translation on how to correctly say each word.

Yes, there are some smaller pictures of other movie poster versions that was put out advertising the same movie in various places. Most are on the left side of the calendar and the right side has round circles for the dates of the month. Regardless of the mini posters, you still would have to crop the poster because of the days of the month. I do think they should have shown how each months poster was actually displayed and not just mini versions of the movie posters. I like seeing all of the different versions for the same movie and especially like  the ones that  are from Japan and the 1 from France. If you don't only want the posters for your walls you can go to your local craft or framing store and have them crop and dry mount the calendar page or it can also be cropped out using a border. <br />  <br />Not so long ago I worked at a bookstore and I if the customer had come up to the front counter and asked to open a calendar, I am sure they would have opened for you, especially since there where no other calendars open. That's just good customer service. Plus I bet by November when all of 2006 calendars are out there will be at least 1 calendar that is open so you can see and page through it. You also have to remember that the gentleman & I that purchased this calendar did so the same month as Episode 3 \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" movie was released during the summer, not during the height of calendar buying season.	2005-06-18

As if the story wasn't beautiful enough, the author took a lot of time explaining about wishing trees and how they are either banyan or camphor trees because these kinds of trees because they have aerial roots that curve & twist into unsual shapes that seem to look magical! She then goes on to tell her reader tells us that people come all though out the year to toss their wishes onto the wishing trees branches, but the majority of the people come during their Lunar New Year. She also speaks of the Ng Bo Dip which means \\"5 Treasures Piles\\" in Cantonese that the wishes are written. The brightly colored red & gold papers are then tied to a Mandarin Orange and thrown high into the branches of the wishing tree. I bet it's a beautiful sight! The author also includes a directions on how to make your very own Ng Bo Dip and also includes a black & white copy for the reader to photocopy, color and cut out!     A definate treasure to have in your home library!	2005-06-12

I never thought I'd want or own a cat, until one evening in December when an under fed, Persian kitten decided to adopt our family.     I got 2 Persian books based on the Amazon reviews, and out of the 2 this book was the best for me. It does have beautiful photos, but to me the information in this book was priceless seeing that I knew nothing about cats. I do wish there was a section on what to do if you've been \\"adopted\\" by your kitten or cat that also gives some basic cat care that could apply to Persians and other breeds for people like myself who know nothing about cats.      This book also has only 5 pages on breeding & care of kittens and only 1 small page on showing your cat, which was perfect for me since our cat will only be a family cat! If you are planning on breeding and showing your cat you might want to pick up Guide to Owning a Persian Cat by Juliet Seymour since it goes into much more detail than this book. If your cat is destined to be the family lap cat, this is the book for you!    PS: Our kitten is just the sweetest, talking kitten that made me the dog lover that I am, just in love my cat!	2005-06-08

Books	5	55	60	N	N	A book to explain & show your curious child	My daughter is at the age right now where she's been interested in seeing her poop which I know is perfectly natural for her age and we are in the beginings of potty training.  <br /> <br />This book is really neat, the animals are beautifully drawn and there are 3 flaps per animals. Two of the three flaps are of other things like animals and the poop is always in the same place bottom right hand corner of each page. Pretty soon your toddler will know exactly where to look. The poop is not graphically drawn but very tasteful. The last page shows a little boy telling his mama he pooped and there in the right hand corner is a potty. So, it does show that that animals and humans poop. Even the very last page is rather cute with a door that you open to see a young girl sitting on the potty reading the very book your reading this review about. Definately a good way to show your pre-potty training child that everyone poops and also where children should and one day will.	2005-06-07

There is a wealth of information in this book and it even has a Words to Know & defination list and also includes 2 other Chinese New Year Books to check out as well as an internet site called FactHound.com which also has some interesting sites.

Our daughter who is 2 1/2 loves this book and so does her mama! It's awsome because several of Sesame Street's favorite & lovable characters are made with fruit, vegetables, blue fruit loops, mushrooms, muffins, banana slices, prunes, blueberries, articoke and even potato chips. It's awesome because they might include some fruits and vegetables your child knows and loves to eat, and some that they might not be familar with as well.     The book does include a sheet of 20 removable & stickable pieces of various fruit & etc to have your child make their own fruity & funny faces on the last page! You might want to just throw away these sitckers since they are of poor quality which is dissapointing and they tear very easy, especially with little toddler hands. Ours what's left of them are half folded over & have some of our dogs hairs stuck to them.      Amazon did rate this as a book for a 4 to 8 year old which is a little high in my opinion. I think this is an awesome book for 2 to 3 year olds. It's very colorful and might have been even cooler if they had a few scratch and sniff areas and better vinyl stickers!	2005-05-22

Full of laughs & giggles	Like I said in the title, this book by far is our favorite version of Itsy Bitsy Spider! And what the photo doesn't show is a soft black spider with big puffy eyes and a huge smile! The spider is attached to the book with a long ( but not too long) black cord and attaches to the second page via velcro. <br /> <br />Margaret Spengler did an awesome job illustrating this book and making all of the insects so friendly looking. And true to form it's the original version we all know and love of the Itsy, Bitsy Spider. What is unique is that on each page other than the 1st page is a lift the flap. On the \\" Washed the spider out page\\" there is a little bug holding up his hand like one does when they though they felt a drop of rain. But when you lift the flap that same insect is there but is now wearing a mask and snorkle. On the \\"Out came the Sun\\" page shows a leaf with a few droplets on it and then when you lift the flap you see a bug wearing tennis shoes and is getting ready to start eatting an ice cream cone sitting in a lawn chair!  And on the \\" dried on up \\" page all you see on the flap is a leaf floating onto of the water, a small paper boat and a pair of eyes somehow that are above the water. When you lift this flap you then see a smiling snail with the leaf & paper boat. And on the last page you finally get to see the happy spider peering out from the waterspout and has made it to the top! The next 2 pages shows you how to do the fingerplay, so you can sing and do the fingerplay after reading this story. <br /> <br />My daughter has always giggled while being read this and still at 2 1/2 does not tire of this silly story!	2005-05-14

Any way this nice big board book has a reflective material that is a none breakable mirror for your child to look into. Each page has a question, Are you in your pajamas? Do you wear a diaper, What color are your socks, Do you see me or can you do this? Does your shoes have laces? Which dress do you like best, what color is your coat? And how many kids do you see.. this one is nice because they actually include your child at the end of this book.<br /><br />What I like about this book is that it has grown with my daughter. From looking at the pages when she was not talking but looking at everything on each page. Now at 2 1/2 she can answer which dress does she like, is she wearing socks?	2005-05-14

I have a daughter who we adopted Internationally and while building a home library I have purchased many adoption books. This I believe is one of the best ones I have read / owned. What I like about this book is it could be used for any child adopted Internationally since it has children from infants, toddlers and children even older. Each photo looks like it was perhaps taken from a someone's life book or a favorite parents or child's  photo. It also has a page that looks like it could be China, or Vietnam and one of the former USSR / Russia, and children that could be from Africa, Asia or Russia. <br /> <br />The book starts simply with \\" Everything in life has a begining. Fragrant flowers begin as seeds. So do fresh fruit and towering trees.Your family began with a seed, too. A seed of love planted and nutured in the hearts of two people - your mom and dad!\\" Your Mom & Dad speaks of your adoptive parents, and only at the end of the book speaks of your birth parents. The book talks about the welcoming home party, the family & friends who came to meet you for the 1st time, of course proud grandparents,the every day things like books, blankets, dinner time, your changing table, baby games, playing in the park with on a sunny day( which is also great for getting rid of jet-lag and adjusting to being back home;)  the naps that EVERYONE in the family took! The ending of the book is really nice too! \\" At night, in the quiet, Mom & Dad carried you off to a bed all your own. They tucked you in safe & snug, and then they prayed for your safety,for your health, and for your future. They gave thanks, too, for the unselfish love that.... across the miles, over land and sea, changed their lives and yours....forever.\\" <br /> <br />I like very much that the author has 3 childeren who where adopted internationally, because they have taken the naps, had the jet-lag and know what we other Intl. adoptive parents have gone through, and the great joy of having a child to love and thethanks and prayers to the parents who gave us the greatest gift that they could not keep.	2005-05-12

I first got the board book version of this book for my daugther & really fell in love with both the story and the artwork! A few months later I happened to read a review where the person said there was a difference between the Hard cover and Board book version. So... I decided to also purchase the book in Hardcover as well.<br /><br />Now that I have both side by side, in my eyes here is the difference between the 2 books. The Hardcover starts with a little girl being awoken by her mother in the morning, and while the girl is waking up  her mother begins to talk about how all the animals that where awake last night while she was sleeping are now all sleeping, whiles she is now awake.  From those 3 pages the books are both the same.... and then the hard back has 5 more pages at the end that the Board book does not.<br /><br />I know that board books are small for small listeners with short attention spans, so I think the publishers choose to shorten a few pages that really do not matter if they are deleted from the book. The board book still stands alone as just as awesome without those 8 pages some of which are illustrations.<br /><br />I use the board book at night before bed to show her that the world is big and while she is sleeping others are awake and so forth. The board book begins with the outline of a home against a stary, stary night. While I plan to use the hard cover book when I introduce her to it one morning or afternoon. Both books are illustrated so beautifully and it still to me is such a neat process that while we sleep, someone in the world is playing!<br /><br />I have also seen this done in the \\"Family of the Earth\\" Books as well.	2005-04-27

I think this is one of the kind of book that we have all seen  at our grocery stores where you get a chance to purchase 1 book  in a series per week. And at the end of the sales run you have books by Disney from about children and places from all over the world. <br /> <br />It begins with Minnie going by train to meet  her friend Tang in China for the  coming Chinese New Year. While on the train Minnie meets Li-Li who is also on her way home for the holiday. They  talk about the Chinese New Year and Li-li points out the Great Wall to Minnie as they passby it. The train arrives at the station Minnie meets her friend while Li-li is united with her family. While saying goodbye to Li-li she give Minnie a map of Beijing and the best places to visit. And also invites her to come and visit her and her family. <br /> <br />From there the 2 stories sorta split and then Minnie visits Li-Li and gets to see people doing Tai Chi, the stone lion statues and Minnie helps Li-li and her baby brother make a Lion costume to dance for their parents to chase away the bad spirits before the New Year comes.  <br /> <br />It's a cute little book that I got mostly because it had Minnie Mouse in it and it does have 4 pages in the back on Did You Know facts of China. Althought I couldn't find the date this book  was published in, but it does seem to be in the 70's and it doesn't really go deeply into the Chinese New Yearlike many of the books that are out there today do. It's a cute for the younger toddler but I think older children would be bored with it.  <br />	2005-04-27

The chapters are:   Like a House  Life Before You Where Born  My Birth  My Firsts  My Life As a Toddler  My Mom's Perfume  My Mom by Heart  My Mom and Me  My Mom and Her Life  My Mom and Her Work  From Mom to Mom  My Mom and Her Family  My Mom As a Baby  My Mom As A Little Girl  My Mom as A Teenager  My Mom As a Young Woman  Meeting My Dad  Our Family   Those Eyes      I think this an awesome book and would give it 5 stars if they had just tweeked a few of the pages by asking someone who's adopted what they thought about maybe 3 or 4 pages. They do get kuddos for actually thinking about and including your adoptive child both domestic and Internationally adopted but, I think they did so late in the book writing so to speak and really didn't give it as much thought as they could have. Some domestic adoptions also have very limited information on the birth mother.    For example:  Page 6 - Life Before You Where Born   It shows a drawing of a very pregnant mom and a space to put your child's 1st ultrasound and what week the ultrasound was taken.     But I still loved the book and plan to work around it and add a 5x7 referral photo of our daughter.    Page 7 Tell me Mom... Mom, please tell me about my life inside of you! This page has a photo of a stork's neck & beak holding 4 green bunddles to write:    1st green bundle asks: How did you know you were pregnant? How did you feel? What did you do when you learned the news? They could have used How did you know I was going to be your child?    If you go left to right the 2nd & 3rd green bundle are OK for your adoptive child, but would be left blank unless you put some more referral photos in these 2 bundles. The only problem there is that usually you only get 1 referral photo 2 or 3 if you are lucky.    4th green bundle - this is where it looks like when doing the final draft of this book said, oh we should include adopted children too! It's question is If I was adopted, how did you and Dad find me? Where did I come from? Did you wait a long time?  OK, but now blank for any child who wasn't adopted - so I guess you could add a baby picture there.    Page 9 My Birth  I love that it says \\" To have or adopt a child is like plunging into mysterious water- the water of an upcoming life that is filled with love. And even if a mom has had other babies, for her, each new birth is another jouney.    Across from that is a little cloud for you to write on Who cut my umbilical cord? Adopted children have so little if any information on their births    Then you put in the date of your child's birth - that's ok  Next - When and at what time was I born? With International adoption at least in China that is information you seldom get.     Week of the day - you can go back and find out on a calendar.    How did it go? (I guess they where talking about your birth) - no usable and another blank space & sensative spot in an adoptive child's life.    The other questions on this page are written well and can be used by all - What did I look like when you first saw me? What did you think? What did you say? Did you take me in your arms right away? If yes, how did it feel? Was Dad there? If yes, what did he say or do? Were there other people there? This one could have been left out or added to Dad's section.    Page 14 My Life As A Toddler - great for those of us who have adopted a baby. You could use this for the referral information that came with your photo, but information is also sometimes limited    And then the other 36 pages are awesome. I love the little sealed area where they included a little pad to put your favorite perfume on. I love that this is a book that both you and your child can do together and have your child draw and answer questions about you her mother.And that later on in life your child and look back and see what she thought and at what age as well as things your child might not have known about you as a child yourself.	2005-04-27

The mother is busy, but I feel in a very lovingly fashion and not like the old mother goose mom who seemed overwhelmed, over worked and generally unhappy with ALL of her children.  Becky Kelly illustrated this book beautifully using her trademark soft water color style. Her subjects are usually filled with adorable children. Not just blonde hair blue eyed children, but children that could easily be from other countries as well.  That's why I think this book would be perfect for all families, but especially perfect for blended families where one child might be biological and has a sister or brother from adopted domestically, or Internationally.

Each page has a few sentences to help your child write or draw \\"out\\" their feelings of loss onto each page. I am even thinking of also in a blank notebook doing this as well for my daughter to see that adults too grieve and miss loved ones.  <br /> <br />A few pages:  <br /> <br />1st page reads:  <br />Some things, like sand and sea shells, don't change, but people change. Is there someone you loved who has changed? Has this someone been sick or hurt? Draw you special someone.  <br /> <br />Page 16:  <br />Sometimes, when a special person dies, we feel like it is our fault. We think this person died because of something we did or didn't do. Death is not something you can control. It is not your fault that your special person died. Draw about some of the things you cannot control.  <br /> <br />Page 24:  <br />When a loved one dies, birthdays, holidays, and other special days can be very hard. You might feel mixed up, scared, angry, and sad all over again. On these days, you may want to plant a tree or do something in memory of your special someone. Draw or write your ideas.  <br /> <br />Pages 26 & 27  <br />Keep something that belonged to your special person so you can touch it and look at it and remember. Write or draw the things you have kept that belonged to your special person. Think about why these things are important to you.  <br /> <br />Do you have a good box to keep memories in? You could put photos and objects from your special someone in this box and look at them anytime you'd like. Draw or write about what you might collect to put in your memory box.  <br /> <br />Midway though this bookthere are also some helpful sugguestions for the reader and for younger children as well.  <br /> <br />If you are looking for something for a preteen or teen and up there is also an excellent book called Angel Catcher - a journal of loss and remembrance by Kathy & Amy Eldon from Cronicle Books ISBN: 0811817318	2005-03-09

I really enjoyed this book and I'm not even a huge ballet follower. After reading this I hope one day I might have the chance to see him dance and appreciate all of his hard work and his humble beginings.  <br /> <br />This book takes you back to when China was under Mao's rule and how the people of China spent their day to day lives trying to survive, and the wonderful oppertunity Cuxin Li had for a better life all because of a teacher pointing him out. I really enjoyed this book!  <br />  <br />	2005-03-09

I certainly agree with the mother who is letting her adopted child know about her heritage, and I too can not wait for my daughter to be old enough to hear these short stories. My favorites where Dog Steals & Rooster Crows, Clever Magistrate and Mr . Yeh's New Year. <br /> <br />Also what I would like to tell all readers is to be aware of the pronounciation guide, Glossary and the Source Guide as you read each story. They will help you with Chinese words you are unfamiliar with.	2005-03-03

This book is packed with so much wonderful knowledge on different kinds of boats! I just, believe that a 6 year old would get so more out of the book. This book could be used for younger boat lovers if you just read the why type of boat it is and move on, I don't really see my nephew sitting down and paying attention. Plus most are boats he's not familiar with or would ever see here in Florida. The art work is well done and looks very realistic.    Here is a list of the boats featured in this book.   A -  Aircraft Carrier  B -  Barkentine ( tall ship)  C -  Canoe  D -  Dory  E -  Electric boat ( submarine)  F -  Ferry  G -  Gondola  H -  Hydrofoil  I -  Icebreaker  J -  Junk ( Chinese Junk boat)  K -  Kayak  L-   Lightship  M -  Minesweeper  N -  Nao (possible Spanish word for boat, no one knows for sure)  O -  Ocean Liner  P-   Paddleboat  Q-   Quffa (basket boat found on the Tigris & Euphrates Rivers)  R -  Reed Boat  S -  Steamboat  T -  Tanker  U -  Umiak ( a traditional woman's Eskimo boat)  V -  Viking Ship  W-   Windjammer  X -  Xebec ( 3 masted ship)  Y-   Yatch  Z -  Zodiac    Update on my review: I had to change my prior review because I gave this book to my nephew and he ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! We happened to be at a restaurant for a family breakfast and painted on the wall happened to be a cruise ship( Ocean Liner in the book) we looked at that page and he was absolutely fasinated during the whole breakfast! This will definately be a book he will grow into especially on some of the boats he does not know about. The age range for this book is correctly rated.	2005-03-03

My nephews birthday was fast approaching and I still hadn't found a book on boats until I happened upon this book! What I love about this book is that it's about all sorts of boats from dinghys to race boats the author Tony Mitton pretty much mentioned every type of boat that floats, except a Chinese Junk or a cannoe! And  he some how managed to make each sentence rythm as well.The characters aren't too cutesty, so boys and girls should like this book a lot! There is lots of terrific information and on the last page has drawn pictures and a mini explaination for words like lighthouse, anchor, propeller, oars, deck, cabin, name and cargo. <br /> <br />To give you as small taste of this wonderfully written book - \\" A boat sits on the water like an empty bowl or cup. It's hollow and it's full of air, and that's what keeps it up.\\" Pretty clever!	2005-03-01

As I said in the title for my review, the artwork alone makes this book stand out! It's absolutely stunning! I can see where your child might be afraid of the Sea Dragon. The Chinese believed that each river or lake had it's own guardian dragon that lived in it's own palaces in the deepest part of that body of water.    I think this is a book where the parent will have to read the book prior to reading to their child as well as knowing how their child might react. If you read the inside of the dust jacket it says that there is some truth to this story and some that is made up. I think the author wove both traditional elements of the New Year where there are fireworks, Lion Dancers & Buddah, Sea Dragons, food and family. I think the author used his imagination on how this tradition could have come about!      I like this book, but I know my 2 year old daughter and at this time she is not ready to read this book, so if you'd like a book to add to your Chinese home library or about the Chinese New Year this is a nice addition and take a moment to read the book before you read to your child. Then gauge if you think the book will excite their imagination or cause them to be scared. Again, the artwork is just outstanding!	2005-02-26

They talk of catching stars by singing and dancing with the moon. Soon the girls  fall asleep under the watchful eye of a smiling moon in the starlight!    Each page of the book is rather simple, which is very nice. It allows the girls, moon and stars to be the main focus. The book doesn't say what medium the illustrator used to illustrate the books, but to me it looks like watercolors on a creme paper and ink pens. The night sky has a bluesy, purple and a little yellow in it which is very soft and inviting your listener to sleep. The story was written by Erin Courtney and rolls of my tongue as I read to my daughter.    Also included with this board book is a cd that has 13 songs. The name of the songs are Big Rock Candy Mountain, Little Red Caboose, Oh Suzanna, Catch the Moon, La Manita ( Spanish Traditional, Twinkle Little Star, Stop & Go, New Morning, Oh Groundhog, Butterfly, Donguri / Rolling Acorn ( Japanese Traditional) Free Little Bird & Fais Do ( French Traditional).    What drew me to this board book was that one of the book's main characters an looks like my daughter & the other girl is blonde reminds us of my sister's daughter. It was an extra bonus to find out the board book also included a CD.  The cd is very nice, it is acoustic, just a guitar and a voice which is very nice. My daughter loves to sing along and surprisingly I don't mind listening to it either.	2005-01-30

This book has taken counting in the meadow to the beautiful world and animals that live under the sea!  <br /> <br />The illustrator Kenneth J. Spendgler did an awesome job!! I absolutely love page 5 with the sea otters. To me, they are so cute I just want to swim out and hug them! Another super cool thing about this book is that on each page the number of the page is hidden somewhere in his artwork, some where easy for me to find, others challenging. To me, this book will grow with my daughter and she'll see that there is more to this book than just a counting! <br /> <br />As far as the young reader who reviewed this book it ad big words in it, the only place I could think of that has big words is on the last 5 pages of the book. This is where the authors included \\"Fun Facts\\" on the sea animals that are featured in the story and the fact that the author talks about how all animals either have  an invertebrate or invertebrates. Or maybe it was the words \\" Sea Urchin\\" and \\"Sea Anemone\\" which  to me either dances off my tongue or twists it about like a tongue twister! <br /> <br />An awesome book that includes the story to song, fun facts on the sea animals pictured and one heck of a terrific artist! For any lover of the sea, you just can't go wrong purchasing this book! <br />	2005-01-21

When you sit down to read this book with your child make sure you have a red or any other color \\"squiggle\\" of your own in your pocket or close by so that once you are done so you too can imagine wonderful objects and things with your squiggle! <br /> <br />I love the illustrater just focuses on the little girl and her new magical squiggle, there is nothing in the background. And now that I've told you, you won't even miss that there is no background! Imagination is such a wonderful thing, something we must make sure that are children do each day. I also love that the author never names the little girl, so you and your child can name her yourselves! <br /> <br />I like that Dragonfly books also take 2 pages - the back of the front cover page and the front side of the back page and uses them to add some more crafts and creative things that go hand and hand with the story you just read! Kiddos to Dragonfly books! <br />The only thing that would make this book a 6 Star book was that it came with a red Squiggle!	2005-01-21

This year's calendar has the same beautiful watercolor drawings that we've all fall in love with . This calendar has 1 large page per month and is held together with a beautiful yellow ribbon that has wire in it, so that the  bow stays nice every month. What is really nice that on the back of each month's page is a bigger version of the same photo so you can easily frame the drawing.

This boardbook will not disappoint, and it's worth it's weight in gold! The difference between DK scratch &  sniff books and others is that DK's scratch & sniff area is a little longer than a post-it-note in both lenght and width. They have mastered their smells too, my daughter loves the banana, orange and strawberries pages and I love the spicy pizza - to me it smells like fresh basil!  The scratch and sniff areas seem to last longer than other scratch and sniff book! My daughter brings this book to me atleast 1 time each day and then we read it 3 or 4 times!  I too have a hard time keeping my daughter from licking the pages! <br /> <br />You can't go wrong purchasing any DK books!	2005-01-06

I remember reading this book to my baby sister when she was young; ( she turns 30 this year). About at this time the scratch & sniff stickers where all the rage as well as those smelly food markers! Any way.... I am very pleased that the book has been brought back in print and I love the story. The peppermint, hot coco and orange smell so good. My only complaint is when they redid this classic why they didn't make the scratch and sniff areas larger! They are the original size that they where back when ( the size of a quarter ) and I remember we scratched the sniff right off our book. In todays world where DK publishing in my opinion RULES the Scratch & Sniff books... like Food and the Garden book, why they didn't take the time to make the scratch and sniff areas BIGGER! They have the technology and I am sure none of us who originally owned the books would have complained because they made the smelly areas bigger! That is the only reason that I gave this book a 4 star rating rather than a 5 star. I have a fondness for Patricia Scary and her husband Richard... just make the scratch and sniff areas bigger! It's a cute story about baby bear and his mama and Papa Bear, I just love Papa bear's hat on Christmas morning!	2005-01-06

He's carrying his red star book as he goes to find that perfect spot to look at his book. The next page is the title page and on the page next to it is the little boy has found the spot he was looking for ... a big brown box near the on the seashore.  Unknown to the young child is that his Ma-ma Mother Moon is looking for him. While searching for a more comfortable position to look at his book, the young boy accidentally drops his book into the ocean and  right in front of a sea otter who was just happening to be passing by.     I don't want to tell you the whole story, except that it is absolutely beautiful and equally illustrated! To me the pages are different enough and the otters looks so soft and friendly I want to reach out to touch & scratch their bellys!    If your child is a girl, I think you could easily say it's a girl with very short hair. What I also love is that the Moon Mother and her son are of Asian decent, which could easily be where other reviewers think the folk lore or stories come from the Chinese story of the Moon maiden & and the cold red which is a very lucky color as well!	2004-12-27

Suzy thinks it's too big! All of her other friends have smaller tails, so Suzy hids her tail anytime she is around her friends. One Suzy hears her friends talking about how they all wished their tails where bigger. By hearing this Suzy decides to show everyone her big tail and all her friends think her long tail is the best! <br /> <br />This is 4 page board book which is just perfect for little hands and Suzy's tail is also not just drawn but has soft long grey material, also perfect for your 10 month old. I think it's nice that at the end of the story Suzy shows her tail to all of her friends and they love it. It is a book that can help you show your child that everyone is different, but beautiful in their own ways.  <br /> <br />I gave it 3 stars because the book is drawn strictly for a child's eye. Then again it was published in 1988 and I think since then illustrator's have been drawing better books for younger children. Then again, it is a children's book and any young child would love it!	2004-12-27

When we where in China for our daughter we visited a Dim Sum restaurant which was excellent! We tried the radish cakes and our favorite was the egg tarts! We did use our 2 fingers to tap to say thank you when our cups where refilled again. Our guide told us that saying thank  you this way came about when  the Emperor playing a game with a lady friend and if she got up to bow to say thank you for tea interupted the game they where each time, so the Emperor made up this way of saying thanks and not interupting his game.	2004-12-27

When Tom realizes his parents are leaving he grabs 1 leg of each of his parents.Tom's active imagination was hard at work! When he doesn't want them to leave,so when he asks if they can stay for the day his whole family does! Everyone has lots of fun! <br /> <br />I have to say this is a terrific book for those children who are not sure what Kindergarten really is or the type that have to know  exactly what will go on during the day. The child's thoughts of  I'll have to leave my mom all by herself with baby sister... what will they do without me? I spent 3 years volunteering at our local elementary school with 2 Kindergarten classes.I've seen the sepparation anxiety of BOTH parent & child on that very first day. And you know... if a parent really wanted to stay the 1st day, I bet the teacher would welcome the extra hands and help! <br /> <br />I just absolutely love that this book was illustrated using watercolors and that David Legge did an awesome job! There are many surprises tucked into this book like the Panda family has a panda teapot, I love the All New Bamboo Cookbook,and also that in Tom's room his clock is a panda and on his wall is  a poster of Charlie Chapplin Panda! A terrific book for panda lovers and children getting ready to go to Kindergarten!	2004-12-19

This story is for both young and old horse lovers. The pictures are drawn using colored pencils, which to me is pleasing to the eye. At the end of the book there are 3 pages of more details on some of the horse and other things that the author talked. Because of that,this book will grow with my daughter and her love of horse! Now we listen to the words, pointing and saying horse, learning her alphabet, seeing a girl that looks like her and to spotting & naming certain breeds!	2004-12-13

A fireman is hurt, but they soon find out he'll be OK. <br /> <br />Will the fireman ever get their turkey in the oven and be able to enjoy their Thanksgiving dinner? I'm not going to ruin the story for you, you'll just have to get the book and read!  <br />I will give you one hint... there is kindness from their local neighborhood and a happy ending as well. <br /> <br /> <br />The author of this book grew up around a fire station and then married a fireman! I think she knows her way around a fire station. The illustrator also included a woman as one of the 10 firefighter, which I like a lot. The story has 2 pages of words with nice illustrations, then there are 2 pages with no words just the illustrations and then repeats the pattern until the end of the book. This is a terrific book for any child interested in firefighters and the ending shows the true meaning of Thanksgiving!  <br /> <br /> <br />Definitely a wonderful book to read to your child around Thanksgiving! <br />	2004-11-22

What a beautifully illustrated book about the Pilgrim & Indian Children who celebrated that first Thanksgiving Day and dinner! We too like the other 2 reviewers love to find the hidden turkey and bunnies! Each page alternates between the pilgrim children and the Indian children showing them playing, gathering, working and eatting! The children are drawn so well, and you almost feel them moving about on the page! It is also nice that this book is a counting book as well! Three cheers for the illustrator and author!	2004-11-22

This is one of those special books that involve your children and actually makes them think about what are they thankful. For me Thanksgiving is a holiday where family and friends gather around a table full of wonderful food and this is where this book starts. I like that book includes different families and that it doesn't focus on the 1st Thanksgiving, but about things that each child is thankful for. Parents who love them no matter their actions, for books, cats, dogs, bright sunny days, friends and lollipops!<br /><br />What a wonderful book that should also get everyone talking about what they are thankful for!	2004-11-08

I like that this book starts as soon as you open the book.. not 3 pages later! On the inside cover with items one might use to make a kite. The next page shows the narrator and her family at the store picking out these items on a beautiful windy day made for kite flying! <br /> <br />I like that Grace Lin uses the Chinese names for each of family members Baba- dad, Mei Mei - little sister, Jie-Jie older sister and everyone know who Ma-Ma is! Each page is a visual treat for the readers eyes. <br /> <br /> Once the story ends, the book doesn't end there Grace tells the readers a brief history of kites and how the Chinese thought that kites could carry away their bad luck & talk to the spirits in the sky. Kites where also in the shapes that the person flying it wished to possess. The author shares that a dragon kite symbolizes power, widom and wealth. She also talks China's annual kite-flying day the double 9 festival and how kite flying spread through out the world. Turn the page, this book continues on showing the reader different types of kites in all sorta of animals and what they stand for! <br /> <br />I also love that when read the little blurp about the author she talks of flying kites with her family and that her favorite kite was a store bought kite called King Kong and how that one day while flying broke free and that Grace still wonders if it's still up there in the sky somewhere flying!  I hope she's right!	2004-11-08

A Present for you, Mommy? Of course- just what I always wanted! What wonderful words to say to your daughter, and words that should  be said often, if not every day! I know without a doubt, my daughter is a wonderful gift!  <br /> <br />Tracy Dockray does a fantastic job illustrating this book. The pages aren't cluttered up, but focus on the little girl and her mother and are done using both watercolor paints and pencils, that just gives the pages a softness. <br /> <br />I remember when my brother was born, my mom started calling me her Tiny Big Girl, even though I was 2, it made me feel big, when I really was little! I am so pleased that this boardbook found it's way into my hands and now heart! And will absolutely be perfect for your tiny big girl who is just wanting to be big!	2004-11-04

I too, heard the song first and it's another beautiful and soul touching song by Lee Ann Womack!  I think we all want to leave something worth leaving behind, and unfortunately when most people think of what people will remember them by when they are gone from this earth, is that they had to do big thing like in art, or that they had to write music, something big.     Well, no... the something you leave behind... is being the best parent you can be to your child, and it's something we all can do!  This is a wonderful book for all parents, both new and old! And if you have never heard the song before, have a tissue within reach! This book comes with the cd.	2004-11-04

What is also neat is that the locals call the White Swan the White Stork because so many adoptive families stay there! The vivid illustrations to me really make this book unique!  <br /> <br />I think you see what you want to see, I don't have a problem with same sex couples.

I really think every parent should take the time and find this book or any other like it and answer the questions for their children! This book helps your children get to know who you are, what your hopes, dreams, rememories of childhood homes, friends and places before they where born!  <br /> <br />I bought a copy for my Mother and I was surprised to find out she wanted to be a teacher, not a secretary. It also gave me a chance to see my Mother as a child and things through her eyes that I never would have known! <br /> <br />It seems like a very thick book, but if you take 1 page a day or just a few you'll be amazed at the memories you remember and also the knowledge that your children will get to know things about you that they might not have known other wise!

Also that her father would not allow Jingyong's feet to be bound, and that he treated her as a son and she was taught the 5 pillars of learning - art, literature, music, medicine and marital arts! There is so much more of the book, but I don't want to spoil it for you! This is an excellent book!    What a fasinating story! The artwork is beautiful!

The things I like best about this book is the Mrs. McMurphy is a woman who lives on her farm in the country,  and she's no dummy! One morning a pumpkin comes to her home and tells her as soon as he gets a mouth he's going to eat her. Each day she nicely listens to the pumpkin each day, and then sends the pumpkin on it's way as she goes about doing her morning work around her farm. I absolutely love the colors in this book they are so bold. And the ending is really clever!    Make sure you read this book first because you know your child and how your child will react, some children might not like the pumpkin, he does look mean. My daughter never had a problem with the pumpkin.	2004-10-08

I love the story and the excitement of Christmas day, for us parents it takes me back to my childhood and I'm sure it will do the same for you, I know it will be one of our books to read in December as well as a Christmas Eve reading along with Twas the Night Before Christmas, this book is that cute.    The last thing I love about this book is for me that I see the daughter as being adopted. I guess we all see what we choose to see and with my daughter looks exactly like the character.	2004-10-07

Having said that it is also nice & very important for us to read or the author's original story. Hans Christian Anderson's was a gifted writer & story teller of many wonderful books. In his book the Little Mermaid it has a much sadder ending than Disney's. But again, it's important to know the original story.     This is one of my favorite Mulan books, simply because it was done not as a traditional book, but as a Chinese folding style book. The book has 2 red covers - red is a very special color for the Chinese. The paper that was chosen looks like it is handmade paper and that just add to the beauty of this book. I also like that the poem is in English and also Chinese Characters. The author put alot of thought into this book, and it really shines!     This is definately one of my most treasured books!	2004-10-07

Note, this is just a good start for a baby book like every birth child has, I am not using this as or in place of making a lifebook for my daughter.<br /><br />What I really also like about this book is that it's not just for the 1st year which I used for the 1st year at home, but goes farther with 1st to 5th birthday, School Bells 2 1/2 pages to record Preschool & Teachers, Kindergarten, Elementary School, After-school classes, 1st time you went to school you....., You were most interested in.... Your ambition was... Your best school buddy... Your favorite teacher was... We beamed when your teacher said.....

Our wishes for your future, When it comes to summing up how we feel about you, always know that....,<br /><br />Adaptions I made to make this book fit for my daughter/ or your child:<br /><br />On the Family Tree page - I put \\" Your China Roots\\" down at the bottom of the tree and on the trunk of the tree where it splits for information on you and your husbands family I put \\" Your Chinese birth family\\". I even added an additional branch for my husband's son from a prior marriage!<br /><br />On the Waiting for You page - Added what agency, the date we started out dossier / collecting paperwork, what we had to collect first paperwork wise, what we where ask to which I added a parenting class we went attended. This page is pretty easy to adapt.<br /><br />On the When we First Saw You page - I talked about \\" the Call\\" we received telling us we where parents and the next day when when I got the Fed Ex package and took it UNOPENED - boy that was hard so that your dad & I could open together at his work and the 3 photos that where included with your medical paperwork and paperwork telling us all about you.<br /><br />On the Showers of Love page - I took the first page and added both Baby Announcements, and the other the 2 showers that where given to us!<br /><br />On Growing Up Page -  I simply added at home and made all of the dates mentioned for how long after we had been home.<br /><br />On Your Special Day - I used for our 1st \\" Forever Family Day\\" or some call it<br /> \\" Gotcha' Day \\"  which is the day you finally meet and get to FINALLY hold your daughter  or son in your arms.<br /><br />It is so hard to find good international adoption books, when most seem to be geared for domestic adoptions, but I had no problem adapting this book to fit my daughters needs. As well as another book I found and liked! I kept them both because this book goes further than the 1st year!<br /><br />I half agree with Beth O'malley in regards to no mention or space for your child's birth parents, but think that this is a very sensitive subject and should be addressed in your child's own lifebook.<br /><br />And as far as sticky stickers, ours didn't come with that sticker. But if you have that problem go to any scrapbooking store and they have I think several sticker removal products, the one I have has a built in sticker removal scrapper.we where parents and the next day when when I got the Fed Ex package and took it UNOPENED - boy that was hard so that your dad & I could open together at his work and the 3 photos that where included with your medical paperwork and paperwork telling us all about you.    On the Showers of Love page - I took the first page and added both Baby Announcements, and the other the 2 showers that where given to us!     On Growing Up Page -  I simply added at home and made all of the dates mentioned for how long after we had been home.     On Your Special Day - I used for our 1st \\" Forever Family Day\\" or some call it   \\" Gotcha' Day \\"  which is the day you finally meet and get to FINALLY hold your daughter  or son in your arms.

I think this a wonderful book and a up close view of what it's like in the kitchen of a Chinese take out restaurant! The book starts out on a very early Saturday morning as the owner's son comes downstairs into the back room of the restaurant as the vegetables are arriving for the day. The cooks he calls his \\"Uncles\\" are getting the woks ready and begin chopping up the chicken, pork butt, spareribs, flank steak, vegetables,  and getting the noodles and rice ready for the day. Then there is folding menus until the metal shutters open at 11 am. The boys whole family works in the restaurant even his Mother & Aunt who work the counter and the phones really fast and sometime at the same time!  <br /> <br />The author also illustrates this beautiful book! The pictures seem s real, just like the photos he took and then drew the photos from these photos. The restaurants menu is on the inside and back page of the book and also shows the author with his take out bag!  <br /> <br />This is a fantastic book, and even more so since it's based on a real Chinese restaurant Kum kau pronounced \\"Gum Kow\\" which in Chinese means golden globe in New York and I hope one day when our family visits New York that we can visit and get some food there! All the while knowing how much work went into our food! It's a wonderful look inside a restaurant kitchen, especially since we order it ... and it magically appears!

The Emperor ordered a new tax to be paid by everyone and this tax was to be paid for in crickets. The father was worried because of little rain the past 3 years produced little money and no money to pay his taxes. The Cheng family's only hope would be to catch a fighting cricket.  One evening the father hear the chirp of a cricket and called for his son to be a bamboo tube and they caught a nice big cricket! The son didn't see the cricket and just wanted to take a peek at it, and when he did the cricket got free and off the son when chasing after the cricket. The son followed the cricket until he was so tired he could go no further. All of a sudden a voice spoke and asked the book what was wrong. The boy told the man his story and said he'd do anything to get the cricket back. The old man asked if the boy would take the place of the cricket and he replied if only I could. The next morning the father had a small red cricket hop into his hand... his was really his son.<br /><br />I'm not going to give the ending away, but I really enjoyed this retelling of an ancient Chinese tale. At the very end of the book is information on when the \\"Fighting Cricket\\" was recorded and information on it's original author Pu Songling. There is also a glossary, but it is only English word your child might not be familar with .	2004-10-04

Baby Sign never says it's an American Sign Language (ASL) book, and if you read a few pages into the book it says so. Baby Sign is strictly for your babys fingers as well as the simplicity of the words. The idea behind baby sign is to lessen your childs frustration and gives them a way for them to tell you, I'm thristy, I want a drink, I am hungry,I see a dog, please read me a book and so on.  <br /> <br />Baby sign does take a while, it will seem like you are signing forever and you are about to give up and suddenly your baby will sign the sign you've been working on. We adopted our daughter from China at 11 months. She understood some Chinese, but did not speak Chinese or English.(I know that seems like a funny question, but you'd be surprised at how many people asked if she spoke Chinese)! Anyway, it took about 3 months working on 2 signs with my daughter and finally one day she signed one of the signs! I love having my daughter tell me she sees a flower, a horse, a baby and or is hungry, wants a drink and that she says please and thank you. I love that you can adapt the signs to fit your family! Now she is stringing 2 words together like \\" Dog  sleeps\\". <br />  <br /> My sister & I taught Baby Sign to our daughters, while my brother & his wife did not with their son. I have seen the frustration, the point and grunt of my nephew & his parents trying to figure out what he wants. Baby Sign lessens the frustration all the way around! I do know that boys & girls develope differently and at different times. Baby Sign makes a world of difference! <br /> <br />About ASL.....I learned some during my teens and I think ASL should be taught in school just like Spanish. It is so important to be able to talk to anyone and not exclude them as they already feel the \\"hearing\\" do. ASL is also more complicated than Baby Sign. So, with that said... Yes, I love Baby Sign and that my daughter can tell me things. <br />Yes, Baby Sign is not and does not claim to be ASL.  <br /> <br />Yes, ASL is just as important, but is not this book. There are other books out there  if you want your child to learn ASL baby sign.	2004-09-25

We have My 1st Baby Signs & Baby Signs for Mealtime as well as this book and my daughter just loves them! I love that these books are in board book form and are perfect for her hands and durable! I love the as you open each page there is a big photo of the word / sign to learn like Ball and the next page shows a baby signing that word! Babies love to see other babies, and now my daughter loves it sit and signs each page of the book! She is so proud of herself!!!  <br /> <br />There are so many Baby Sign books out there for parents, both Baby Sign and American Sign Language or ASL books. I like Baby Sign because the signs are easier for little fingers and your baby can create a sign that fits to their needs. The Baby Sign for drink is your thumb to your mouth. My daughter signs drink with her 1st or pointer finger to her lips or in her mouth because she now drinks out of her Dora no spill straw cups.  <br /> <br />It is so amazing to have your child tell you... flower, or theres a cat, or a dog, please read me this book, thank you and please! Now, she is stringing the signs together to tell me \\"dog sleeping\\".  <br /> <br />If I have a complaint about these books is that 2 of the books have 1 sign that is in both books. Other than this, it's an awesome and must have book!	2004-09-25

This board book is just a must have in every young child's home! What is also neat about this book is that it has a \\" Say -N- Play\\" mini recorder built into the book so your child can practice what to say for when your child gets lost.    Everyone at sometime gets lost, I still remember being young and having something take my attention away from my parent and then looked up to see my mother now where in sight. This book helps the child role play in a safe place.. your home.. and among loved ones, so your child will know what to do.     If you're lost, find a \\" safe\\" grown-up like a police, security officer or store clerk and ask that person to help you. Remember to stay calm, you'll need to tell this person your 1st and last name, and your parent's name, then your address and phone number. Each page is broken down into 1 small task - say your 1st and last name then you practice and then get to hear your \\"own voice\\".  I think this is a tremedous book, that will enpower your child that he or she knows what to do, and not to panic. A must have book!    New update: Because of this book our 3 year 3 month old daughter now can tell you her first last middle name, her parents first and last names, her complete address and phone number. We have also gone into some of our favorite stores and met with store employees and security people so \\"if she ever gets lost, she'll know where and who to go to\\". Often when we read this she'll reach over to me and say \\" Mommy your here\\" which my reply is yes, I am. Knowledge is power!!!! IF you ever get lost you'll know what to do. 4/2006	2004-08-30

I think this is a fanastic book! This board book has a telephone keypad to help your child practice how to dial 911 and what to do. If the number dialed is done so inccorrectly it gives you a sound to let you know you dialed it wrong, but when dialed correctly you hear a man's voice say \\" 911, then a bell, then the sound of a firetruck and then the man again saying good job.  This book walks your child through each step making sure the child knows to say their name and home address.  <br /> <br />It's done in a simple manner that just gets the point across that if something bad happens and you need help it's called an Emergency, do you know what to do\\" It goes through each step... 1st try and find and adult, if no one is around find the nearest phone and dial 911. A nice person will answer and will tell you what to do. Then the book gives several situations like a fire, if someone is hurt and even if someone has a gun. The last page says remember 911 isn't for fun! Only call it for an emergency. This is one those books that your glad your child has, but hopes they never have to use this knowledge.	2004-08-29

I love this book and  the illustrations are beautiful! But the book does not end there, it contains counting, the alphabet AND rhyming!  <br /> <br />Here in Florida one of the tasks Kindergarten children should know how to do before going on to 1st grade is to be able to rhyme! And one of the easiest ways to start is to rhyming with the child's own name!  <br /> <br />I also like that this mother did know what do to do with her children and seems much happier than the Old Lady in the Shoe ever was or felt!	2004-08-29

With a daughter from China I think it's important for her to see that there are angels that look just like her!  <br /> <br />I don't have a problem with the baby in the book climbing out of his or her crib.That what a toddler does, it's their job to explore, to taste, to touch and being constantly on the move in their world. Reading to your child is so important and while reading it gives you the parent a chance to talk about climbing out of their crib, or climbing up onto something they shouldn't.	2004-08-27

Ming Lo and his wife love their home, but not that their house is at the bottom of a big mountain, which caused them nothing but unhappiness. Their roof always had holes from falling rock. It rained often under the mountain and with a roof full of holes it meant their rooms where damp and when the sun did shine it's warmth  warmed the house and it was difficult to grow anything. <br /> <br />One day Ming Lo's wife told him he must move the mountain so that they may enjoy their house in peace. Ming lo replies that he's just man, how can he move a mountain? Ming Lo's wife knows of a wise man who lives in the village and tells him he should go and ask this wise man. And so Ming Lo does. Each time doing exactly as the wise man tells him and each time the mountain did not move. Finally the wise man told Ming that he must take his house apart stick by stick .They would carry these bundles in their arms and on their heads, and then face the mountain and close their eyes. Next the wise man said you must dance the dance of the moving mountain. You must do this for many hours and when you open your eyes you will see the mountain has moved. So Ming Lo and his wife did as they where told and when they opened their eyes... the mountain dance had worked and the mountain was now far away! <br /> <br />Arnold Lobel has a beautiful book with soft colored drawing!

Each Grace Lin book I get, I am just so impressed by her talent! Every child loves to get their hands into dirt and growing flowers or vegetables is always fun and gives the child great pride to show everyone their hard work and or beautiful flowers!  <br /> <br />Every child wants to be just the same as their friends, especially those in the neighborhood. Mom and daughter start in the spring to plant their garden and while everyone else in the neighborhood each have their own way of tending their gardens  totally different from how her and her mom garden. When their plants appear they look like grass, where other neighbors'  appear they look like normal plants. <br /> <br /> The little girl constantly asks questions as all children do, why mommy, why mommy and her mommy  patiently answers each of her daughters questions. When others in the neighborhood have beautiful flowersthat smell so good, the little girls garden has what she sees as ugly plants with no beautiful scents. Once the vegetables are ready to be harvested the little girl and mother gather their wheelbarrow with their vegetables. Later that afternoon the daughter is out playing in the yard and smells a wonderful smell and it's coming from her house! Her mom has made soup using their harvest and her mom gives her a bowl..... it tastes so good! Then there comes knocking at their door and it's the little girls neighbors wanting to trade their beautiful flowers for a bowl of soup. The Mom tells the neighbors about each vegetables and the next spring the little girl notices her neighbors growing \\" Ugly Vegetables\\" too! <br /> <br />I love that Lin includes a receipe to make using these so called \\"ugly vegetables\\" and that she included their names and even sounded them out. Keep up the good work Mrs. Lin and I'll keep on buying your books and singing praises to anyone who'll read my reviews!	2004-08-22

I was hoping that the words for the song where Xiao Foo ( Little Lotus)  teaches Big Bird how to say Big Bird, Hello, Little Lotus, good-bye and I love you. Instead of the song,  Xiao Foo brings Big Bird & Barkley home to ask her mother if she can help them find the Phoneix. This is where you have the same words both in Chinese and English and is very nice. It helps tie the dvd together and would have been nice if they included it in the video. And in the book big Bird does not come across as such a whiner... I guess I must be getting old if I notice this.  <br /> <br />Since Sesame Street has released Big Bird in China to dvd, maybe they will re-release this book! It would be really nice to have also with the video!!!	2004-08-20

As history states, many countrymen lost their lives and where buried inside the wall. Meng's husband Wan is a scholar and should not be made to leave home to work on the Great Wall on the orders from Emperor Qin Shi Huangdi, but he is told he must go . Meng patiently waits for her husband to return home. One evening she has a vision that her husband is cold and freezing to death. So, the next morning she begins her journey to find and bring him warm clothes. When she finally makes it to the Wall she is told her husband died  while working and was buried in the wall by the sea. Meng walks the wall to the sea . Somehow from the depths of her soul, she  harnesses the heavens and with the rain shatters part of the wall. She then pricks her finger and shouts for her blood to find the bones of her husband. Once she finds her husbands bones she gathers them up and turns to go home to give her  a proper burial. She is then taken by guards to the Emperor. He wants to know why she destroyed his wall. So in telling her story the Emperor wants to have her as his own. So he gives her a choice.. either give yourself to me, or I will have you beheaded. Meng replies back she will become his if he will do 3 things for her husband. The Emperor agrees and once all 3 are done Meng thanks her family and renounces her vow and throws herself off into the sea. <br /> <br /> I really like the artwork and how strong Meng is in the face of the Emperor. I especially like the last line in the book that says that her Chinese people remember her courage and takes courage themselves	2004-08-20

I came across this book. It's about a young girls family in Hong Kong right before the historic change from the British to becoming part of The Peoples' Republic of China. Tsz Yan and other families who live in Hong Kong wonder what changes will happen and how their life will change when this happens. <br /> <br />The book is also interesting because it shows a difference perspective of how others go to school and how other families lives. Tsz Yan's father works in China and leaves on Sunday night to travel to China and stays there until Friday evening, so during the week it is just Tsz Yan and her mom. The photos are absolutely beautiful capturing everyday life in the eyes of a young girl. There is a translation page for 13 words used in this book!

Now instead of putting everything into her mouth, now it's straight to her nose! So a board book about The Wiggles, one of her favorite Wiggles' songs - Yummy, Yummy fruit salad and that it also smells makes this book one we read often through out the day!! Our book included 14 scratch and sniff apples, bananas, watermelon and grapes stickers. You could probably let your toddler place the stickers on each page, but I did this before I gave the book to my daughter so that she thinks it's part of the book and not stickers to peel off. The stickers smell so good and the book does not follow the song word for word, but it's close enough!  Perfect for the Wiggles fan in your home!!!!	2004-08-15

It is alway neat to find out what your grandparents did when they where little girls themselves. The book allows your grandmother to put a childhood photo on the back page, and then each page has a drawing that puts your grandmother's face in the correct place for that picture. Pages are titled Family, School, Pets, Dolls..toys..games and hobbies, Tv.. radio and movies, books, vacations, Holidays, Money, Lessons I have learned and the last page is so your grandmother can record an embarrassing moment, fondest memory, or some other significant event from her childhood! <br /> <br />A simular book for Grandfather's is not out as of yet, and says Dec 2030, but I think that is a typo. An excellent book and what to get to know your grandmother and one your child will treasure for many, many years to come!	2004-08-14

Emma notices her cookie is different looking that her brothers and asks why. Emma and her grandmother sit down and look at Emma's very own life story book. This is a book that I hope my daughter will enjoy and help her understand there are other girls and boys who have been adopted, have similar questions and maybe feel the same way.    It does not mention birth parents or abandonment so this is a good book to start to introduce your child to the fact that other babies have been adopted from China. The pictures in the book do not look like actual photos so your child will not get confused that this is actually her story but a little like her story.       This book is very special to us, especially since I found this book after we'd named our daughter the same name as in the book before even knowing about this book.	2004-08-09

Baby sign is for your toddler to be able to tell you things that they can not yet say. The signs are simple and helps the parents and the frustrations of your child with less tears, pointing and grunting. It also lets your child tell you things, wich in my eyes  is so awesome! My daughter can tell me if she sees a dog or horse, she can tell me if she wants a drink, says please, thank you, she can tell me she wants me to read her a book or if she wants more of something. I love that the book is a board book which is perfect for a toddler. My daughter was adopted from China when she was 10 months old and for us, Baby Sign is awesome. Yes, it is not true ASL, but at least we are also teaching our daughter who is thriving and speaking that there are other people who can't talk and sign instead. There are other books that are ASL based, but for toddler hands are more complex and difficult. <br /> <br />One more thing... baby sign is not highly know about and people who see our daughter sign ask if she's deaf. When we explain, I think they see how neat it is that our daughter can do the signs. We also happened to be at Mc Donald's the other day and a deaf couple sat down and began to sign. Well, my daughter's eyes lit up and as we where leaving she toddled up to this couple. At first the couple was annoyed, I guess thinking she was staring ( she's only 19 months), but when I explained she knew some baby sign and did a few signs the couples eyes lite and I think it made them feel that sign was important, they didn't comment that the signs wheren't ASL, but where happy someone was teaching sign. <br /> <br /> I hope this helps. It also helps to have the Baby Sign book as well as the board book. If I have a complaint it is that some signs are repeated in some other other board book! There is nothing better that seeing your daughter sign \\" dog sleeping\\" and I think it actually makes her feel like she has something important to say!!!	2004-08-09

This is a book is a travel journal of a young girl who was born & spent her first 5 years in China before moving to the United States. I was disappointed in the fact that most of the book is the  young author's complaints about getting up in the morning, having visiting family that she doesn't remember and doesn't include her in many adult conversations, she loves to shop and her Nai- Nai (Grandmother) doesn't approve of her spending her money.  <br /> <br />After spending 14 days in China when we adopted our daughter, I have to admit it is soooo different than her in the US. Yes, it is crowded with people, bicycles and cars. Guangzhou was smoggy, but it wasn't unpleasent. Sqautty potties - their restrooms are quiet different than at home, we got use to the differences. I guess being an adult I see the world much differently than when I was younger. I was hoping that the author would see some of the differences and simularities that her birth country and current home had in common. Visiting China was an experiance of a lifetime. Both my husband and I fell in love with China and when our daughter is in her 'tween years we are taking her back to see her birth country!	2004-08-07

As a proud mother of a child born in my heart I love this baby book &amp; journal. With a few little changes,I've made a book I know my daughter will one day treasure! On the page that says<br />&quot;the big day&quot; I just added at the Visa &amp; US Consulate exam and added the time of the appointment, her weight and a name of one of the doctors there. On the family tree page, I just added another branch above my daughter's name to acknowledge her birth parents in China. On the &quot;How Much you Grew&quot; pages I chose to use this as how much she has grown since she's been home. Each page has a soft watercolor drawings and there is lots of room, for photographs, and to write down all of your child's wonderful 1st times, holidays celebrated, 1st artwork, a page about mom, dad and siblings. Toward the back there are pages for &quot; Our Hopes&quot; &amp; &quot;Our Dreams&quot;, as well as 10 double sided pages to record memories of you on this day.... If I could talk to Beck Kelly and ask her to change 1 thing, it would be to have the last page to say &quot; The Begining&quot; not &quot; The End&quot;.
