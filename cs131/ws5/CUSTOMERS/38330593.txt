Someone needs to point this out to Mr. Simpson. Andrew Johnson attempted to do the same type of Reconstruction Lincoln wanted, \\"let'em up easy\\". The Radicals hated Johnson, as Johnson turned out NOT to be their puppet, and he REALLY was a Democrat. Simpson feels the need to bash Johnson, as HIS HERO, GENERAL Grant,[look at his books] was the NEXT President. According to Simpson Grant was in fact one of the BEST Presidents!! (Right!!!LOL) Finally, Simpson pushes all the blame on those Southern people. Get real Mr. Simpson, contrary to your writing, (just because YOU write something, does NOT mean it is fact), the South was not wearing black hats, and the North was not wearing white hats. This book is full of anti-southern propaganda, hoping gullible readers will take it as fact. It's a waste of money. I give it only one star, as I can't give it a zero, which it deserves.	2005-08-10

Chapter One: 'Negro Mobilization' <br /> <br />    \\"It would appear that Virginia was not faced with a serious breakdown of its holding power over the Negro noncombatants until the closing says of the war. Flight into Union lines, however, or seizure by Union troops, though seemingly less extensive than in other parts of the Confederacy, was a cause of concern. In countless ways, the war came closer to the Virginia Negro than to other Negroes with the South. Both of the war governors, John Letcher ad William Smith, encouraged and supported Negro mobilization and war measures whereby the labor of Negroes contributed to the ability of the Confederacy to keep an army in the field. The Virginia Negro resided in what was not only the industrial heart of the South but also the major battle ground of the Civil war. Armed conflict greatly increased the technological and military demand for his brawn and his skills. Virginia's coal mines, ironworks, lead-smelting works, nitriaries, harness shops, arsenals, naval yards, and machine shops offer unique examples of the state's efforts to match Negro manpower to the need for increased production. The many diversified needs of the war involved the Virginia Negro in correspondingly wide variety of tasks-procurement operations, processing of minerals, fabrication of the weapons of war, transportation of war materials by land and by river, and construction of fortifications and defensive works. Probably no other southern sate offers a better example of the premium placed upon Negro manpower.\\" (p.-15-16) <br /> <br />    Chapter Two: 'Quartermaster and Commissary Noncombatants': <br /> <br />    \\"Both the Quartermaster and Commissary departments were conscious of the logistical importance of Negro manpower, and they competed effectively with other departments for their services. As they competed effectively with other departments for their services. As they needs to increase the war output multiplied rapidly, both the Virginia and theConfederate Government made provisions for placing the black noncombatants at their disposal of the services of supply though military hire, impressment, and conscription. From February 1864 to March 1865 the Bureau of Conscription detailed 341 Negroes to the quartermasters scattered throughout Virginia. As in any undertaking which involves large numbers of persons, the Negros who met the needs of supply will forever remain anonymous to posterity, Yet thousands and thousands of Negroes played a vital pert in feeding, supplying, and sustaining Confederate combat forces in Virginia.\\" (p.30) <br /> <br />Chapter Three: 'Naval Ordinance Works': <br /> <br />    \\"In retrospect, the mountain blast furnaces, as they belched smoke and fire into the sky, dominated the industrial scene of the Valley. Industrial Negro labor was an indispensable factor as the Tredegar Iron Works wrestled to fulfill vital war contracts with the various bureaus of the War Department. The realistic war practices of this industrial plant were based, from the very outset of the war, on the full and extensive use of black manpower-and skilled and unskilled-in the procurement, transportation, and fabrication of raw materials and the delivery of finished products to Confederate fighting forces, southern railroads, smaller industrial plants, and various branches of the War Department such as ordnance, quartermaster, engineer, and the navy.\\" (p.73) <br /> <br />Chapter Four: 'Transportation Laborers': <br /> <br />    \\"It would perhaps be claiming too much to say that Negro manpower, the sinew of the war effort behind the scenes, provided Virginia with the means of continuing the uneven contest. Yet it is impossible not to conclude that had the Virginia's transportation arteries been deprived of Negro brawn and dexterity, the Virginia war effort would have been severely and seriously hampered.\\" <br /> <br />Chapter Five: 'Negroes in Confederate Hospitals': <br /> <br />    \\"Most of the thousands of Negroes-nurses, ambulance drivers, stretcher-bears, cooks, bakers, and other hospital attendants-are now nameless. Yet they bathed patients, fed the sick and wounded, administered medicines, aired and made beds, cleaned wards, maintained fires, and performed numerous other tasks, Other colored hospital attendants prepared food, washed clothing, whitewashed and repaired buildings, worked in the purveyor's office and the commissary, labored in the gardens dairies, and icehouses maintained by the hospitals, drove wagons, and so forth. Seldom were they mentioned n the journals of their day, and only a few were named or described in the memories of Confederate surgeons. On the other hand they never engaged in wholesale desertions. The decision to place them as attendants in the military hospitals not only freed many thousands of soldiers for military duty but considerably lightened the burden of caring for the sick and wounded in Confederate armies. Now wholly forgotten, these Negroes' names have no meaning today. Confederate medical histories seldom discuss the Negro. For the same reason, too, the story of Confederate logistics is incomplete.\\" (p.129-130) <br /> <br />Chapter Six: 'Confederate Labor Troops': <br /> <br />    \\"Virginia's fortifications and the labor force responsible for their construction have received less attention than other phases of the Civil War. Yet, from every part of Virginia, thousands of Negroes were called upon the encircle cities and vulnerable areas with cordons of earthworks, and their labor undoubtedly prolonged the war by preventing Federal invasions from seriously affecting the resources of the state. Their story not only provides new insights into the history of the warring South, but contributes to an understanding of the many ways in which the Virginia Negro was inextricable related with the Southern war effort. When weighted against the tragic theme of the stunted existence which resulted from his enslavement, the war discloses that hehad a compelling effect on the course of the war and that his service was a key piece in the mechanism of Southern defenses.\\" (p.163-4) <br /> <br />Conclusion: \\"Today, in a lonely unmarked grave, forgotten and unknown, lies the Confederate Negro-a casualty of History.\\" (p.167) <br />	2005-06-12

Dean fully explains the secrecy of the Bush administration, which he terms more secretive than the Nixon administration.<br />The very fact that this Nation is currently in war in Iraq, over information the public and Congress received from the Bush administration (Imminent threats of Weapons of Mass Destruction), is also a fact that the  honest reader can not deny.<br />This book is good to review the time table of the Bush administration, and Dean certainly compares it to the Nixon administration, (which he served under), and in my opinion is qualified to make his assertion that &quot;Worse than Watergate&quot; is an apt description of the Bush administration.  <br />This Nation did not go to war over Nixon's lies; Yet US soldiers are dying in Iraq over false, mis-led and &quot;Creative&quot; information, from the Bush administration.<br />This is a good book, and a fairly quick read.	2004-04-09

Contrary to what some other reviewers have stated, the author Furguson discuss's the battle of Cold Harbor, not Gettysburg, or anything else. The facts are Lee had the ANV well entrenched. Grant used the same tactics, as he did at Vicksburg, which is ordering Frontal assualts, in human waves. This time Grant's men paid a very heavy price. The Union troops were mowed down by cannister, and grape shot. It was like Fredericksburg all over again. Grant ordered his troops to get up, they refused. The most the troops did was raise their weapons and fire. ( The ones still alive) Grant then went back to his headquarters and wrote an order stating there would be no offensive movement the rest of the day. ( Good idea, as his soldiers already decieded that themselves)<BR>  [ not included in the book is Grant having W.T. Sherman using a similar frontal assualt at Chickasaw Bayou. ( Confederate entrenched and devastated Sherman's army)<BR>    Grant's theory of war was simple, in his own words, &quot;Find the enemy, get there as soon as possible and hit them with everything you have.&quot;  <BR>   Well, human waves--a Grant speciality--didn't work a Vicksburg, it didn't work for his subordinate, W. T. Sherman at Chickasaw bayou, and Cold Harbor, Grant admitted was his biggest mistake.<BR>    This is a book that quotes letters from the privates, Generals, and is hard to put down. <BR>  If you like the Civil War, this is, in my opinion, the best book on Cold Harbor	2003-11-01

Many of the Union soldiers were bayonetted in their tents. <br />There was an investigation afterwords, from Senators, about what happened. ( Grant and Sherman, after the battle, were busy &quot;covering their butts&quot;. Grant was ready to quit, as Halleck no longer trusted Grant.)<br />Grant failed at Shiloh, due to the fact they never acted upon the information that enemy forces had been seen around their camp. Grant failed, also by not following west point tactics maintaining a &quot;clear field of fire&quot;, in front of their base. ( Just to name two major errors)<br />Shiloh, Day TWO, Beauregard faced an ENTIRELY NEW ARMY. U.S. General Buell's 18,000 plus soldiers had arrived during the night.<br />Now HOW in the world, Catton gives Grant the credit for Day TWO and what he calls, the victory here escapes me. This is like a wrestling match, where one person is on the mat, getting pounded, and from outside the ring comes his partner to his rescue.<BR>   You'll see this repetitious theme throughout the book.<br />MY other big fault is the biased statement. &quot;Grant was a child of his times&quot; ( speaking of his views on Africian-Americans)<br />Well, I certainly do agree with that, but what I don't agree with is had ANY CONFEDERATE/SOUTHERN soldiers said the very same words, they would have been branded as the worst kind of rasict.<br />I like reading about Grant, Sherman, Lee, Jackson or any of the Civil war Generals; and this is a good book, but the author writesin the hero worship mode.<br />I would highly recomend, in addition to this &quot;Tom Worthingtons Civil War&quot; by James Brewer.

( Col. Tom Worthington) who was a West Point graduate.<BR>While the Union soldiers were camped at Shiloh Col. Worthington, rode around camp looking for axes, so his troops could level the trees in front of his regiment. ( This is called, clearing a 'field of fire') Sherman didn't think it was necessary. In fact Sherman felt they were in no danger of attack. Even though the records point out that several officers told Sherman there were Confederate Cavalry close by, and about 200 Confederate soldiers watched some of the Union officers review their troops at Shiloh. Many of the Union regiments had never had one drill before the Confederate attack, which resulted in many of them not being able to respond when they were attacked. In fact, many of the Union soldiers had never even fired their rifles one time, let alone practiced drills of any kind.<br />    Sherman in fact told some of his regiments, after they warned him, 'if they were that afraid, maybe they should just go back to Ohio'. ( as a minor note, even General Grant did not believe they would be attacked)<br />    Col. Worthington, of course would not be silenced, in his protests of the Union not being prepared, either before the attack or after. In fact, Col. Worthington became more outspoken after the battle, against Sherman, and laid much of the blame on Sherman for not being prepared. <br />Worthington and Sherman hated each other intensely.<br />Sherman waited for his chance, as a superior officer. Sherman had Col. Worthington court-martialed, he was convicted, and later Judge Holt overturned Col. Worthington's court-martial. Yet, Worthington was not allowed to rejoin the army. Worthington later, even met twice with Lincoln. The second time Lincoln referred the matter to Grant. Grant of course did not want Col. Worthington back in. <br />Col. Worthington was an arrogant person, older than Grant and Sherman. But, the facts bear out he was right at Shiloh. <br />One has to wonder why Grant and Sherman did not want Col. Worthington back in the army. Were they afraid Worthington would continue to talk, or perhaps look for mistakes? or create dissension.<br />There is no question, Col. Worthington, of the 46th Ohio Vol. performed admirably at Shiloh. Perhaps even going so far as to save one entire wing of Grants army.<br />If you're a Civil War buff, this is one book that is really interesting and well worth reading.	2003-07-29

They fought for, and against, the French, the Spanish, the English, as well as with Andrew Jackson in the Battle of New Orleans in 1815.

At the first of it, I was becoming tired of the author claiming Semmes was a 'rasict'. ( give me a break, during the 1800's 99% of all white people were, even Lincoln)<br />The author, Warren Spencer quite obviously admires Semmes, and does a great historical job. <br />This is a short version of Semmes own book, which is a little over 800 pages.<br />Semmes was a very intelligent person, and an astute lawyer. His prowess upon the seas, still holds records to this day. <br />The Germans were ordered to study the tactics of Raphael Semmes with their U-boats.<br />I deduct one star from what could be a 5 star book, due to the aforementioned 'racist' nonsense. And secondly, the rareity of footnotes and primary sources.<br />The author uses quotation markes, where he quotes Semmes; BUT, there should be a footnote, with the primary source, preferably on the bottom of the page. There are some of us Civil War buffs, that stive for accuracy, and demands primary sources. I know Mr. Spencer used them; but footnotes, previously mentioned would have been as asset.<br />I wish to quote two very good lines from this book--<br />    --\\"Our Southern movement, in the eyes of Spain, was a mere political revolution, and like all absolute governments, she had no sympathy with revolutionists. It was on this principle that the Czar of Russia has fraternized so warmly with the Federal President.\\" [from Semmes journal]<BR>    [ authors note-'this is an insight into the diplomacy of the Civil War that has to date escaped the notice of authorities on the subject.]....If you're a Civil War buff, ( or a sailor) you should have a book, on Raphael Semmes, this book would be a good choice.	2003-07-17

John Tilley must have spent years researching  this. <br />What Mr. Tilley does in the book, is describe the pieces to the puzzle; then explain how they all fit together. It's an amazing book.<br />What most Civil War historians miss is Lincoln's letter of 12 December 1860, ( this rather shows Lincoln's assumption to interfere in governmental affairs, even though he was still a civilian--voted in, but not taken the oath of inauguration 4 March 61--, and questions a belief in undermining the current President Buchanan.)-----From this book you read----&gt;<br />   --&gt; Lincoln had sent to E.B. Washburne [ 12 Dec 1860 ],for secret transmittal to George Winfield Scott, commanding General of the army, this message:  ---&quot;Please present my respects to the General, and tell him confidentially, I shall be obliged to him to be as well prepared as he can to either hold or retake the Forts, as the case may require, at and after the inauguration.&quot;---<br /> Primary Source: Nicolay and Hay, Lincoln III, page 250 ( see also)<BR>                 Robert McNutt McElroy, &quot;Jefferson Davis; the Unreal and the Real&quot;, I,  page 278<BR>      ( did you notice the word, &quot;secret&quot;!)<br />This book quotes the O.R., the O.R.N., The Diary of Gideon Wells, &quot;The Genesis of the Civil War&quot; by Crawford, amongst a host of other sources.<br />    Tilley totally debunks the &quot;Starving Garrison&quot; story that was fabricated for the Northern newspapers, to build support for the war.  Example---<br />    By Anderson's own figures he had enough provisions on hand to last his garrison, until April 26th. This did not take into consideration, the supplies ( Meat, vegetables, solidified milk, butter, soap, and groceries), that they received from Charleston, after that.<br />     Beauregard even sent cases of Claret and cigars over with his compliments<BR>    ----&quot;Battles and Leaders&quot;, Vol 1, page 82-----<br />    In fact Anderson's garrison were supplied from Charleston, until the first week of April, when the reports came in that Warships where headed towards Fort Sumter.<BR>    Anderson's own words refutes the &quot;Starving Garrison&quot; story concocted for the Northern papers.<BR>    Anderson stated, in a week they would be starved out anyway.  ---meaning they did in fact have food then.<br />The first chapter of this book reads a little slow, as Tilley seems to 'set a stage', or introduce us to the mystery. ( This could be compared to a mystery novel; except this is factual) Reading the second chapter and beyond, the days leading up to this are put together, from the records, and even many Civil War buffs should learn a few things.<br />A very nice touch at the end of the book, are several pages taken from High School History books, concerning the Fort Sumter incident. ( I like these quizzes at the end, a shame more books don't have them.) By the end of the book, you'll see the mistakes these High School History books teach. If you don't, then Mr. Tilley, uses the Official Records, and shows us the mistakes.<br />Probably the best Fort Sumter/Civil War book on the market. <br />Did you ever wonder why Lincoln never said, &quot;What a minute fellas; let's sit down and talk this thing out.&quot;<BR>Read this book and find out.	2003-07-08

My version is one of the original printed books, which sells for $150.00. ( this book is a real bargain at this price!)<br />J.W. Jones was a Chaplain who knew Lee, Jackson, Gordon and others very well. Jones meet with them, prayed with them, and of course was with them in the Army of Northern Virginia.<br />This is not a \\"WAR\\" of \\"BATTLE\\" book, but exemplifies the religious character of the aforementioned people. On this basis, I have to give it five stars. <br />As a book that touches your heart, with the feeling of those men that served in the ANV, I also give it the maximum of five stars.<br />I would like to quote just one page---<br />\\"Christ in the Camp\\" by J. William Jones D.D. page 50, Sprinkle Publications.1886<br />    Feb 1864, Chaplains, Rev. J.W. Jones and Rev. B.T.

Which is the reason I bought and read it.<br />This is a great western book. Copyrighted 1934.<br />This not only has short histories on several gunfighters, but there is also a nice section on how to perform the flashy moves with the six-shooter. If you've tried these spins, twirls and shifts, you've no doubt found them difficult to perform. Yet John Wesley Hardin was a master at it, and it was Hardin, who taught Ringo the tricks. ( Hardin also told the guards, to get that psychopath--Ringo---out my cell. They shared the same cell in prison)<br />I would consider this a mandatory book for a Old West gunfighters library.

If you check the quotation such as ones from Shermans Memoirs, they are accurate, but he uses the OLD TWO VOLUME set, so the page numbers will not be the same as the new single volume.<br />Quotes from the O.R.

After listening to this, I bought the book to see where Kenneth C. Davis got his information.<br />Guess what! There is NOT ONE FOOT NOTE, AND NOTE SOURCE!<br />Davis apparently spins his tale from a faulty memory, which obviously includes fantasy and political correct views.<br />Davis presents the Civil War, as the Northern people becoming outraged that the South had slaves, and were mis-treating them.<BR>( the South had over 245,000 free black people in 1860, which Davis won't tell you) <BR>Davis implies the Northern people left their farms, and family to rescue the slaves. ( need I go further)<br />Davis begins on page xii ( preface) with the 1995 killing of a teenage over a Confederate flag, which he says happened in a parking lot.<BR>Wrong: This was a teenage boy, that was pursued by a car full of black people, that shot into the boys pickup, as it was going down the road. ( The gunman is now in prison)<BR>Davis talks about the racist South, EVEN IN THE 1970'S, using a case of him taking black Children in a church in Wilmington, NC.

This helps clear confusion for the novice. (page 446-7 is one example)<BR>    Other reviews have spoken admirmingly of this book, I would like to draw attention to an incident Grant tells of, where a Union soldier is stealing ALL of a Southern ladies chickens.The Southern woman vainly pleaded with the Union soldiers to please spare her a few at least.<BR>    The Union soldiers looked at the woman and said,<br />    >\\"This rebellion has to be suppressed if it takes the last chicken in the Confederacy.\\"<  ( Page 555 Grants memoirs) <BR>   ( how will this woman and her children eat after this?)Another following incident---<BR> <BR>    >\\"The South prior to the rebellion kept bloodhounds to pursue runaway slaves who took refuge in the neighboring swamps, and also to hunt convicts.

Sherman, ( see my review of his book, and the direct quote), there is no doubt the Southern women, children and families suffered greatly during the Civil War.

William's uses 4 to 6 different sources for each quote and incident. This book tells more about Beauregard than many Civil War Buffs know. William's goes into the Beauregard and Davis feud that lasted not only the entire war, but to their dying days.<BR>    I feel it is unfortunate that the feud prevented Davis from employing Beauregard, rather than putting inferior Generals in Beauregards place.<BR>    Beauregard seems to be quite the inventor, with a sharp intellect. ( Beauregard once proposed the Confederate Army use Rockets with explosive war heads, a design he had figured out. The Confederate Government thought that idea was too radical, total nonsense, and disregarded it)<BR>    William's believes Beauregard performed his best battle in Petersburg 1864, and uses ample sources, and references to make that conclusion, which I agree with.<BR>    I've often thought Beauregard would have made a better President than Jefferson Davis, it seems that William's has this belief also.<BR>    I must say that William's seems to be a little hard on Davis, I don't know if all of that is justified, though I'm sure some certainly is.<BR>    I don't believe there is a better biographical book on P.G.T.

The majority of Americans, would rather see 200,000 American soldiers, and an equal number of Iraq Soldiers, ( or civilians); die, so they could have cheap gas.  <br />   Yes, I know---that is a horrible statement; but I have to agree with Bill Maher on this. Most Americans are too used to the luxery; especially the present, \\"I\\" generation, that they refuse to make any personal sacrifices that could avert a war. <BR>    Americans are giving; but ONLY TO A POINT; as one philosopher in the book stated, If most Wealthy Americans had to choose between letting a child starve, or their Mercedes; they'd choose their Mercedes.

In the North, with the passage of the fugitive slave act, Harriett Tubman knew her people would/and could be 'captured' by Northern slave catches, ( who frequently captured free African-Americans as well) and sold them back into slavery) Traveling at night, hiding in the swamps, carring laudnum to keep the crying babies from crying and giving them away, and a pistol for safety, and risking her very life should she be captured. <br />  I regret there was never more recorded history on Harriett Tubman. Her bravery, and heroism are awe inspiring.

When I read mine, I was aware of this, and carefully used a yellow highlighter so as to be able to more easily find references, for debates, articles, and quotes.<br />  This book does not present a Northern OR a Southern side of the Civil War. JUST FACTS, That is the true beauty of great history books.<br />  Some people have two sets of these books, one for the office, to go over in our spare time, and another in our homes.<br />  My warning to those that undertake to read this wonderful set of books, is don't be surprised, when you feel let down, and a little depressed, as this story has to come to an end.<br />  As a good read, there were many pages that made me shed a tear; ( When Lincoln lay dying, and Senator Sumner was crying like a baby); to the anger at the vivid description of Shermans army burning Columbia. ( This is very descriptive, as is much of the book)<br />  Shelby Foote painstakingly took 20 years to write this book, and did a phenomal job.	2003-02-17

It is a great book for people that like StoneWall, or don't have a lot of time to read. ( This is a short read). StoneWalls maxims can be used today as well. This book, also gives us a better understanding of this great American Hero. ( How hard General Jackson tried to be a perfect man, shines through, with this book. One can only admire General Jackson all the more)<br />  It is well worth the time spent reading it.	2003-02-17

This book provieds plenty of ammunition for debates, when people say how terrible Andersonville was. <br /> The North NEVER had a food shortage, Never had an embargo, with-holding food, medicine or clothing. Yet, all this was PURPOSELY with held from the Southern POW's at NOT only Elmira, but other Northern POW camps for pure and simple revenge. This book contains the documents by General Halleck and Col. Hoffman, who ordered the suffering of these poor Southern soldiers.<br />   Using information from this book, has already IN MANY OF MY DISCUSSIONS, quickly halted the accusations of The Terrible Southern POW camps.<br />   The facts are extremely well documented, and the book, while a great read, does a vivid description of the horrors of Elmira. ( Called, \\"Hell-mira\\"--by the POW's) ( This book does include photos) <br />   In conclusion, after reading this book, one may wonder how can civilized people, treat their fellow human beings this way. Unfortunatly, this is another chapter of Americas shameful history.	2003-02-17

I thought it would be rather dull, therefore it remained in my library, for sometime, until I finally started on it. What a wonderful surprize! I thought I was pretty sharp on the Civil War. Well, I found out things I didnt know, and was delighted to learn. This book is really a great addition. The authors goes through the Civil War, and give so many minor incidents attention, that many of us over look. Did you know the first Aircraft Carriers were made during the Civil War? ( The ballons launched from them!) I'd challenge any true Civil war buff, to read this book, and not say, you learned a few things. And this book is very entertaining as well. I've also found myself going back to this book, for references, many times. HINT: When you read this book, you may want to use a highlighter, so you can go back and find your references. It's a worthwhile addition to anyones Civil War Libary, and I'd have to recommend it as a good book, for someone that has never read a Civil War book, but wants to learn. Very nicely done, well written. Get job guys.	2003-02-14

Who should read this book? If your'e a history buff, a Civil Rights workers, a Lincoln Buff, A Civil War reenactor, or an open minded person with a desire to learn about Lincoln, his life, and his actions not only from his birth, but through the Civil war, to his death.<BR>  <BR>  This book is extensively well documented. Nothing is quoted from Lincoln that is not referenced; which all history buffs admire.<br />   I feel the author is correct in stating America was originally built and framed for White America; and that Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln REALLY did not believe Black people were the equals of white people. ( as a matter of fact, Lincoln is quoted very often stating just the opposite) There is an excellent case made that Lincoln was terrified of having four million slaves freed in America; as well as Lincoln continued efforts to send blacks to Liberia.)<br />  While I give this 5 stars, and it richly deserves it, I do find a common misconception, which does not detract from the quanitity of great facts.<br />  The flaw is the author gives the impression that  General Robert E. Lee was in favor of Slavery; when such was certainly not the case. ( The is no reference to this, and I do not believe any such exist) to the opposite view, is General Lees own words-\\"There are few, I believe, in this enlightened age, who will not<BR>acknowledge that slavery as an institution is a moral and political<BR>evil.\\" - Col. Robert E. Lee, USA - December 27, 1856 <br />  The other assumption is the mistaken belief that slaves were not allowed to read. If I may state the Virginia law--<br />   The state of Virginia NEVER had any law that prohibited the teaching of slaves/Negroes to read and write. A master could teach his own slaves, and he could ALSO allow anyone else to teach them.  In short, it was up to the master. The law is Stat. 1830-31, p. 107.  That law dealt with \\"unlawful assemblages\\", and said in part, \\"(a)nd every assemblage of negroes for the purpose of instruction in reading and writing, or in the night time for any purpose, shall be an unlawful assembley.\\"  However, the previous section, commencing the definition of these \\"unlawful assemblies,\\" EXPRESSLY STATES, that they are unlawful IF HELD WITHOUT THE MASTER'S CONSENT. <br />   Overall I highly commend this author, and would certainly love to hear him speak. He brings a totally different light to the average ( white persons) view of history, and Abe Lincoln.<br />  I also highly recommend every black person read this book, that believes the Myth that Lincoln fought to have the slaves Freed.<br />   This book is a real eye-opener. ( You might want to use a yellow highlighter to mark your references when you read this great book)<br />   Well done, Mr. Bennett	2003-02-14
US	38330593	R1EADVWKOG1GBW	0517162377	777937386	Lincoln and His Generals	Books	3	12	14	N	N	a good authors opinion	While I enjoyed this book, I felt the title was deceptive. The author, T. Harry Williams, trys to convince us, that Lincoln was a master strategist, and it basically was his strategy that helped win the war. ( I HAD thought this book would be about Union Generals, as Douglass Freemans- Lee's Lt's was about his. That may have been my fault, for misunderstanding)<br />  I read this book with an open mind, yet with a good knowledge of the Civil War, and of McClellen, Meade, Grant, Hooker, Burnside, Pope and McDowell. McClellen stated many times, that Lincoln could not hold on to a secret, and that was his reason for not keeping him informed. Also, many of the plans McClellen devised, were later used by Grant. Hooker built the Union Military up, and did a fantastic job of organization, from the bottom ranks up. Meade, did much of the work, that we give Grant credit for, ( though Meade did make the newspapers mad at him, and refused to name him)  <br />  Lincoln is a very interesting man, but I feel it is a stretch to call him a master military strategist. <br />   If you enjoy reading someone elses view, or opinion of the Civil War, this is a really nice book. But, that is why I can only give it three stars, it is good, but too much of the authors opinion.	2003-02-13

This is one of the best Civil War books, I've ever read. John Waugh brings so many of our Civil war Generals, both North and South, back to life. We learn so many interesting details about their lives at West Point. This book had me laughing, with their antics at West Point, it rather reminded me of my own \\"boot Camp\\" life in the military 25 years ago. I can still see Thomas J. \\"StoneWall\\" Jackson, sweating at the blackboard, to try and solve problems,walking at the same pace, even when the others hurry to get out of the rain. The Fight that almost broke out, in the Church at West Point, between two future leaders. <br />  One of the things, John Waugh does, is very emotionally grab you by the throat, as he describes StoneWall Jacksons dying, his wifes and Lee's reaction, and the funeral. I literally, had to put the book down and wipe the tears from my eyes. I've read about this incident, many times before, but Waughs version, really got to me.<BR>     McClellan, A.P.Hill, Pickett, Wilcox, Stoneman, Darius Couch, Sturgis and many others are brought to life.<br />  I have so many Civil War books to read, but I certainly want to read this book again, in the future. <br />   If you're a real Civil War Buff, you owe it to yourself to read this. To me, it was as good as Shelby Foote.	2003-02-13
US	38330593	R28RP5I9YML2HZ	1572493356	569290990	Myths & Realities of American Slavery: The True History of Slavery in America	Books	5	51	74	N	N	This book deserves a 10 ( Ten Stars)	I read quite a number of books on the Civil War, and American History. This book, is perhaps one of the best books I've read in months. It was very hard to put down, without finishing it. The author discusses the emotional topic of Slavery, it's orgins, the myths in media, legend and tales, as well as facts. John Perry uses very detailed and documented sources, including the 1860 census, even breaking it down to age, region, city and state. Too often people tend to discuss slavery, with nothing but emotional feelings, often incorrect.<br />  A copy of this book, should belong in every city, and school libary. (I personally bought a second copy, after reading mine, to donate to our local library.)<br />  I can only give this book 5 stars, as that is all that is allowed, but it deserves more. Mr. Perry has written an excellent book. I honestly can not see how anyone could read this book, and not enjoy it. Every serious student of American History, the Civil War, or even the issue of 'racial problems' in America, should read this. ( As well as the person that just wants an engrossing book to read, curled up in a chair)<br />  I LOVED THIS BOOK.	2003-01-30

Grant <BR>    Mr. Lankford then attempts to state that Lincoln wanted equal rights for the African Americans! Here again, the facts bear out Lincoln by his own speeches--\\"Negro equality, Fudge!! How long in the Government of a God great enough to make and maintain this Universe, shall there continue to be knaves to vend and fools to gulp, so low a piece of demagoguism as this?\\"  -- Abraham Lincoln 1859 [Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, Vol III, PP 399, Basler, ed.] <BR>    Or <BR>During the fourth Lincoln-versus-Stephen Douglas debate on Sept. 18, 1858, in Charleston, Ill., Lincoln emphatically stated his view of the role of black people in American society: <br />\\"I will say that I am not nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races; that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters of the free Negroes, or jurors, or qualifying them to hold office, or having them marry with white people. <br />\\"I will say in addition that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which, I suppose, will forever forbid the two races living together upon terms of social and political equality; and inasmuch as they cannot so live, that while they do remain together, there must be the position of the superiors and the inferiors; and that I, as much as any other man, am in favor of the superior position assigned to the white man.\\" .\\" The Collected<BR>Works of Abraham Lincoln edited by Roy P. Basler, Volume III, \\"Fourth Debate<BR>with Stephen A. Douglas at Charleston, Illinois\\" (September 18, 1858), pp.<BR>145-146.\\")<br />    Rm. Lankford continually implies the Union army was the \\"army of freedom\\"  PP. 118, line 14, through the entire novel. On page 244 Mr. Lankford again attacks Lees character, when Lee went to kneel beside the freed slave, at St. Pauls church, by stating the person that reported it, \\"could not have divined what was in Lee's mind\\" ( Do we suppose Mr. Lankford does?)<BR>    For the aforementioned reasons, I can only give this book one star.<br />    I would give Mr. Lankford an A+ for his graphic description of the women crying in church, during the first Sunday, after Union occupation. Actually much of the description is very nicely done. <br />    I would like to see Mr. Lankford write more books on the civil war era, but hope he would be less biased, in his future books.<br />    Minnesota Senator Morton Wilkerson stated  the only hope for the country was the \\"death of the President and a new administration\\" PP. 205<BR>    I've read extensively about this, and would wish Mr. Lankford would write a book, on who actually pulled the strings behind the Lincoln assassination and cover-up. ( Booth escaped on THE ONLY BRIDGE THAT STANTON did not close, he was a suspect, other northern senators also openly expressed the desire for Lincoln to be shot)<BR>    Mr. Lankford, you write a book on that topic, I'll be the first to buy a copy.	2002-12-23

Solidly backed up by countless documents, the author gives you the hard truth about Lincoln, and the Civil War. Many of us know, that as state after state secceded from the Union in 1860, Lincoln sat in his home at Gallitan, Illinois, not making one speech, as the incoming President should have done, to try and prevent this. Reading Mr. Dilorenzo fact based book, explains why. Heavily referenced, with hundreds of sources, the facts speak for themselves. My only complaint--it is not out as an AUDIO book yet, I've found myself going back to the book to verify many times since. An Excellent book, very hard to put down.	2002-11-25

Documenting facts from Shelby Foote, Douglass Freeman, the O.R., as well as many others, the author pulls aside the veil of falsehood the Conquering North invented. <br />We learn the exact dollars the Southern states paid into the Union in 1859; how Lincoln wanted a Civil War, and failed as a leader from the start, ( sitting in his home at Galena, Illinois, after being elected, while state after state seceded, not making one speech or writing one letter to try to prevent a war)<br />Lincoln's refusal to meet with Southern leaders for any type of appeasement, or diplomacy. The atrocities the Union troops committed against the Southern women, New Manchester and Roswell, Georgia. ( Transported to Northern concentration camps, raped along the way. NONE of them ever to be heard from again) Col.
