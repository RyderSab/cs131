This book felt like a rush job; the characters were more like caricatures: soap opera-like and unbelivable, which is unusual for Mr.Harris as his characters are usually so life like. He relies too much on pop culture. There is an abundance of cliches. And I think Yancey and Basil's relationship should have been played out from the beginning. I can hardly believe Basil loves Yancey; just because he says so isn't enough. Show--don't tell--is the oldest writing tool in the book but it is the most effective. How did Basil make the transition from woman hating to woman loving? Well, this book in no way will deter me from reading E. Lynn's following books, because no one's perfect--he is allowed a few faults--and the previous books were so good that I shall keep the faith!	2000-11-13

So I turned to Sandra Brown's latest, &quot;The Switch.&quot; Having read an excerpt of the first chapter, I was intrigued by it and got the book. Only to be disappointed. Never in an SB novel have I seen such underdeveloped characters. The relationship between the sisters was portrayed so briefly--we are only TOLD but not very well SHOWN that they are extremely close. I think their relationship should have been shaped more richly. And the brief romance between Chief and Gillian hardly led me to believe they were in love--that subject is vague, as well. And Melina, to me, is a carbon copy of many Sandra Brown characters she has written about. She was a caricature, not a character, not someone that I felt was three dimensional or well fleshed out. And the plot fell apart as soon as the murder occured, it wasn't exciting anymore. And the Brother Gabriel plot was so far fetched I laughed when I was supposed to be taking it seriously. Thank God I got this book for 99 cents at the Doubleday book club!	2000-10-29

I liked &quot;Flyy Girl&quot; because Tracy's character was so refreshing--so obnoxious, so confident, a break from depressed main characters wallowing is self hatred. She is selfish though--only caring  about wearing the best clothes and getting on with the best guys, but  that's a portrait, I'm sure, of many girls growing up. I know girls like  that. At least in the end she became a stronger person--with a focus and a  purpose, a realization that life isn't all about her and clothes and boys.  Her story concludes with her more mature, but not changing completely, just  adapting.	2000-06-24

Away from  home, she is able to find herself and BE herself. In the first novel, she  questioned her sexuality. In this one, there's no doubt about it. Although,  Stevie finds that a relationship with a woman can be just as trying as one  with a man; that being yourself means having to defend yourself while  maintaining who you are--to please yourself, not other people. Of course,  finding herself means she has to be truthful with others (read: her family)  in order to fully be comfortable with who she is. I'm not gay myself, but I  find this tale of stumbling across one's homosexuality more realistic than  E. Lynn Harris' work. If you are liberal--and not squeamish about  homosexual encounters--then this is a good read.	2000-06-12

She's a study in imperfection: overeating, excessive drinking, procrastination. She lacks sophistication, thrives on self improvement and obssesses over men. She's not Everywoman, but she is someone, who, in her  indelicate, calorie counting, wistful self is far more realistic than the  beautiful, together heroines of romance novels. She struggles with her  weight, just as a lot of women do--thinking herself fat when she isn't;  swears to diet and stop smoking, just as soon as she's finished her last  &quot;fag&quot;, her last &quot;Milk Tray&quot;; she craves after the hunk  at work in the manner of a junior high school girl. Her adventures are  funny and she is endearing because she is not perfect. Though she gripes  about married people's smugness, her focus is not primarily on finding a  man. All this is chronicled into a funny, fast read that shouldn't be taken  THAT seriously--enough to say she's giving women a bad name and blah blah  blah. It's just a book! And an enjoyable one.	2000-06-09

Granted, it is thick, but the problem isn't the length--it's the fact that the adventure is over too quickly!  I enjoyed it very much, finished it off it about three days, because the  characters were so intriguing. At first Katherine seemed one dimensional,  but it was her secret that made her the way she was--so set in her ways  about her former life. And Tara seemed like a man hungry ditz, too--though  living her mistake in the end made her a smarter, stronger person. They  aren't the most deep characters you'll read,(the gay character seemed like  a huge steretype) but it's a fun break from serious literature--a definite  beach read.	2000-06-09

I knew that there was supposed to be some sort of meaning to them, but they were pretty bizarre. They are like portraits of ordinary life with a twist of weirdness. I figured these  stories were supposed to have some kind of moral, but it escaped me.<br />And  the characters all seemed ruthlessly unhappy, so much so that I became  depressed myself. They didn't need to be recklessly happy, but their lives  were so messed up and in the end, their problems were unsolved, and that's  why it was so depressing.<br />This is a collection of stories that need to be  read and re-read so that one can understand the meanong of them.

I found it boring and predictable and  cliche. It didn't bother me that it wasn't literary (although I prefer my  books that way) because all writing doesn't have to be that way (the last  time I checked there was no law against it) but for God's sake I couldn't  find anything in it that made it real to me. It seemed designed to make  people cry...manipulative. I'm sure Mr. Sparks has more talent than that;  he doesn't need to pull those tactics. It seemed like a romance novel  masquerading as regular fiction and I'm not a big fan of romance novels. I  tried &quot;The Notebook&quot; but found the same boring, predictable  cliches that I did in this one. i couldn't even finish it. Sorry, Mr.  Sparks. I hope your books contiue to be bestsellers, but I won't be buying  any more of your books. They're not my style. But anyone who read this,  don't let it discourage you from buying his work, this is just my opinion,  and the rest of these people seem to think his work is good.

I don't like books that hand you the message or tells...this book shows. And it is an example of great fiction because the writing is beautiful and subtle and unique,  the storyline is complex but richly woven, and the characters are  belivable. To tell the plot is like saying what the Bible is about. There  is so much to it that the plot couldn't be told in a sentence..maybe in a  thesis, but to ask about the plot is to ask a heck of a lot. It's not just  a novel, it's a history lesson, it's social and political commentary. It  captures the essence of the sixties and seventies and African ancestory and  the family structure. It is not an easy book--it took me three reads to get  it--but it is worth it. This is literature. This is writing.	2000-05-21

Freidman as Herself&quot;,  &quot;Otherwise Known As Sheila The Great&quot;,&quot;Freckle Juice&quot;  and the &quot;Fudge&quot; series. So I was, of course, very pleased to read  &quot;Summer Sisters&quot; which I thought was wonderful. Of course, I read  it in a day and was sorry when it was over. I love how Judy Blume drew out  the complexities of a friendship and how it is nearly destroyed by  Caitlin's selfishness. The writing made the read fast and enjoyable and I  wasn't nauseated by any cliches. The descriptions in the book made me feel  like I was there, experiencing the things the girls did. This book is like  a vacation in itself.	2000-05-21

The descriptions of nature--though a bit excessive--were beautiful and vivid. The relationship  between mother and daughter were achingly real. The dialogue worked. And  the tapestry of outside stories made it seem so real--that there was a town  outside of Amy and Isabelle and that their situation wasn't the only focus.

The subject matter is fine. It is the book itself that disappointed  me. I'm not even going to compare it to his better novel, Flyy Girl,  because the mark of a good writer is being able to write about different  topics. But &quot;A Do Right Man&quot; seemed to be lacking something.  Perhaps it is depth. I mean, Bobby's whole basis on becoming a man stemmed  from his career and relationships with women. His situation with his  disapproving mother is glossed over in favor for his love life. The old  (and effective) writing tool &quot;show, don't tell&quot; isn't used at  all. We can tell Bobby is successful; there's no need for the author to  spell it out. We can tell Bobby has bad luck with women; we don't need that  spelled out, either. There isn't any descriptions of settings; in fact,  there is a great lack of description of any kind. And yes, Bobby has career  struggles, but they last about the length of two pages. And his  relationship with Faye pre-Pearl is so short lived, how are the readers  supposed to feel bad when their friendship breaks down? Sure, we are told  that they were close, but it's hard to believe considering we never get to  see it and decide for ourselves. My imagination was so inactive during this  book. It is not one of those &quot;can't put down&quot; reads. I had to  force myself to finish it just because I paid for it. It is a tedious read.  More like &quot;can't pick up!&quot;	2000-05-14

It's an exploration of how each individual's life is affected by the war; it explores the people they were before the war and how it has changed it. In  a sense they ALL are patients. They all need treatment.  The writing is  exquisite. Though much of the novel is difficult to get through, the  writing more than makes up for it. If you are to read this book, have  patience and time. Don't take it on the beach. It's cerebral. Very  intelligent. And this isn't a Harlequin romance; it's one you can actually  believe in. But it should be read--I think it's a very important book in  CANADIAN fiction.	2000-05-10

But the writing style alone does not make a book. There was a sense of emotional detachment and underdeveloped  characters. I thought Jack's secret life was more shocking than it actually  was. And Kathryn's relationship with her daughter was repaired too quickly  in the end. They should have been affected much more by the secret life  their husband and father was leading. Wouldn't they have needed therapy, or  something? And Robert--what was the point of him?

If there is any novel that is exquisite and disturbing, it is this novel. It is the story of a little girl that doesn't know how to  love herself and is therefore uncapable of loving. Her environment is one  of violence and pain and longing. She longs to be loved. I found myself  wanting to actually reach out to her and hug her, to show her what love is  like. It is a shame that she is never aware how truly wonderful love can be  and how it can make her feel--how it can make her self-hatred and low self  esteem evaporate. The language--as I always find in Toni Morisson's  writing--is beautiful but subtle. The plot is not hard to grasp and  stretches itself wonderfully throughout the book. Truths are told; things  that society needed to hear then and still need to hear now. But I warn  you: this book will rip your heart out.	2000-05-07

If anything stands out in this book, it is the characterization of Winter. What I found, however, was that the events that occured in  Winter's coming of age, or whatever you'd like to call it, seemed quite  unrealistic. Every time she was just about to run out of money, she got  more. Every time she was in a scrape, she got saved. I thought it was  supposed to be a fall from grace of sorts when her father got  arrested--meaning she'd have to suffer. She didn't seem to suffer too  terribly. It wasn't like I was looking for a Greek tragedy, but...and she  still got hers in the end, so...still, I was knocked off my feet by how  quickly and effectively Winter was developed. I'm not saying the book was  bad at all. It's just that I needed to believe from her fall from grace a  little more. Even so, Winter is so obnoxious, I still wouldn't have felt  sorry for her.	2000-05-06

Thomas was an excellent character, too. What I love about Mr. Lamb  is that he makes you care, whether you want to or not. This book is  incredibly deep. The 900+ pages shouldn't scare anyone off..the content  more than makes up for the length. And the length is needed. What is also  needed is more books like these.

He's a good writer, good at describing the setting and the character's  appearance and the like. But the relationship between Kimberly and Jordan  could've been fleshed out. Instead we were TOLD what the relationship was  like and not SHOWN. He should have had more scenes of the growth and  development of the relationship so we could judge for ourselves, as the  readers, whether we thought the relationship was stable or not. And the  book went downhill after Kimberly's mugging. So many things were left out.  Like the topic of her husband--Jordan just got over that? And the fact that  David died--shouldn't she have felt more for that, even if he was a jerk?  And Jordan quickly gets over his shock of Kimberly hiding things from  him--her true culture, her husband? Shouldn't they have had a discussion  about honesty?

(Note to the reviewer from Georgia--God is  LOVE. And it isn't up to you to judge. We ALL sin.)	2000-04-18

I really wanted to give this book a try because I read &quot;He Say, She Say.&quot; What a waste--I had to look at the back cover thirty times because I couldn't believe Ms. Joe is a Yale graduate. I don't want to hate  on her, because I am an aspiring writer myself, but this book lacks  intelligence, the slang is cliche, and the characters are stereotypes, to  me. It seemed rushed.	2000-04-18

The language was simple yet exquisite and at times, so telling, so real. It just seems that there are gaping holes in the story--like Cole. What was her story? And the mother's  story seemed unfinished, just like the father's. I agree with the reviewer  who said that the other characters were two-dimensional. The ending  disappointed me as well. Don't get me wrong, I really liked the book. I  didn't expect it to be perfect. I just think more could have been done with  it. P.S. I can't believe someone called this book trash!	2000-04-08

Books	5	5	5	N	N	A beautiful, lyrical, can't-put-down-masterpiece	I read this book for my Canadian Fiction class and thought it would be boring. I was wrong! What hit me first was the beauty of the writing. Then it was the story itself, the attention to detail, and the intense  characterization. It held my interest all the way through. I don't  understand other reviewers' complaints about it being too dark. I  think  there was enough humor in the novel to balance out the &quot;dark  parts&quot;. I'm sorry--but reading about a bunch a happy people just  doesn't hold my interest--and that is not realistic anyway. I prefer these  kinds of novels over fairy tales. I like characters with flaws. And this  book is one of ths best.	2000-04-06
