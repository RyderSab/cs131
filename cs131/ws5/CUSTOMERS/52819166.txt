The story was so long-winded, but I kept reading, hoping, wishing...  Maybe JM will nail it in the middle, toward the end... She never did!  The characters were unbeliveably one-dimensional, lifeless and tiresome.  I couldn't believe she came up with these characters after the those she created in Perfect, Paradise, Whitney, my love and Until You.  The story line was another let-down.  I just cannot belive a woman who lost her husband she loved so much, even though he cheated on her with almost very female character in the book, in a few weeks would fall desperately in love with someone else.  Especially when she found out her dead husband who she loved so much wasn't the man she knew.  She hardly cared! There were so many unanswered questions.  And then there was a stalker wandering aimlessly in the storyline that sometimes JM seemed to forget about.  Just disheartening.	2005-05-25

There wasn't as much wit, and barely any fire, if any.  I liked the Daphne story twists, but the heroine seemed a little contrived and not so well developed.  The story dragged.  I trudged through it anyway.	2002-03-14

Willow, a heroine of a kind, took on our charming Prince's numerous brats.  Their antics kept me reading through the night screaming  with laughter. A must read!	2000-07-15

Ahh, and Diana, our wonderful heroine, is very refreshing and well-developed. A strong countess, who knows she wants Rothgar as a lover despite the dire consequences if she  allows herself even one night of passion with our wonderfully dark hero.

One within easy reach so if you need a good romance with believable characters, you have it.  A riveting romance survives between Faith, Gray, and a horrible night.  I  love Faith.  She comes alive from the pages as a warm, intelligent woman.   Gray is the ruthless, domineering, sexy hero.  I admit I fell in love with  him too.  It is my favorite book.	2000-03-23

Most of the book is Victorian.  You may find snippets of Regency here and there, but as a good reference guide, it is  most certainly not!  For good reference, get &quot;What Jane Austen  ate...&quot;  Most Disappointing!	1999-08-01

I started the novel and did not put it down until I was done.  Thank God it was the weekend.  The novel is so well-written, not to mention  hot and steamy.  If you love Ms. Howard make it a point not to miss this  one.  It was that good.  Now I am going to get every book she ever wrote.	1998-11-08

It is about Nicholas Bragg, the first-born son of Derek and Miranda.  He is also the Earl of Dragmore.  He is rumored to have murdered his first  wife even after he was found innocent by a British court.  He is wild,  explosive, uncouthed and as handsome as sin.  Jane Barclay becomes his ward  and she is determined to tame the Texas rakehell.  Their story is simply  delicious.  One that you will read time and time again.	1998-11-08

It was defintely worth the search.  It is a great novel about half-breed Indian warrior who brands Candice, a blonde beauty his woman.  The two go through  so much it was a wonder either of them did not break before the end of the  story.  It is a book worth reading.  It reminded me a lot of &quot;Innocent  Fire.&quot;  It is difficult to get your hands on this one but as I stated  before it is worth the search.  Now I have every novel Ms. Joyce ever  wrote.  She is a great and wonderful writer not to mention exciting.	1998-11-07

This novel was very well-written and a keeper.  As to the  reviewer who said this novel was too verbose, I believe one should be able  to tell a well-written novel from a childrens book to read at this level.  The novel virtually came to life around you.  A great novel indeed.	1998-10-31

I just fell in love with Son of the Morning and had to go look for her books.  I tried it because of the reviews on Amazon.com and I really do not regret my  decision to go out and buy it.  It was hard for me to believe this was her  first time-travel since I am a very big fan of time-travel romance.  It was  just so well written and very informative.  I enjoyed every page of this  book and I do hope she keeps exploring the realm of time-travel.  There are  very few good time-travel romances out there and Son of the Morning is a  treasure among them.  Good work Ms. Howard!  Keep it up!!!	1998-10-28
US	52819166	R1IM5C211W1WAP	0671019708	691382940	After the Night	Books	5	2	2	N	N	HOT!!!	This story was just so hot.  I loved it.  I love it when the heroines are strong characters.  I do not know how many women would have gone back to Prescott after everything that happened and faced Gray.  Faith was such a  wonderful character who had had a very difficult and cruel life but was  still able to come up on top.  Gray was a very hard man and under the  circumstances was understandably mean to Faith and her family.  I loved the  way they could not deny the passion that was simmering between them no  matter how they tried.  It was just too hot.  I believe this story is one  of my personal favorites that I will read many more times to come.  I am  going to get the rest of her novels.	1998-10-28

The others are also very good but  I was drawn more to the story of Araine and Simon.  It was just so  interesting that you just kept thinking about them whenever you put the  book down.

Like all of Ms. Joyce's fans I always and very anxiously await her latest  books but this book was something else.  It is certainly an  improvement  from &quot;Splendor&quot; and &quot;The Finer Things.&quot;  The hero was  always beaten and as for the heroine I wondered why it took her that long  to gain her freedom when she could have used what she knew long before.   Apart from that the  book was very good.  I really do hope Ms. Joyce next  novel is like &quot;The Game&quot; or any one of her earlier works.	1998-08-28

She was the expert in that time period.  She was  supposed to know the events surrounding the period.  I expected her to use  it to her advantage.  She was also somewhat weak in character.  I really do  hope the sequel is different.  This was an interesting read though.  If you  have not read it I suggest you do so.  I just had a little trouble with  Alex, the heroine.	1998-08-28
