It's probably unnecessary for those seeking higher degrees, but some younger students might benefit from reading it.  The author is a Psychology professor and much of the book draws from theories of learning.  You'll also see some psychoanalysis in the discussions of anecdotal stories.  If you're not into that, it may be a problem.  The author is best at discussing the broader issues concerning school such as motivation and knowing your support systems, while the details about writing a term paper, or overcoming math anxiety were thin and almost useless.<br />If you're an adult, and you're anxious about going back to school, then I recommend the book.  It'll soothe your anxiety and you'll be better able to evaluate your readiness for school.  Otherwise, I'm not so sure you'll find it worth your while.  If you want a book on how to study well, better ones exist.	2003-07-22

If you want to learn how to cook, this text can help you lay the foundation for your education.  Covering everything from nutrition to food safety to knife sharpening techniques to types of food and recipes, this book is for those unsatisfied with stacks of cookbooks.

Indeed, if you've read \\"Andromeda Strain,\\" this would be a good follow up.  And it's probably scarier than Crichton too.  <br />Laurie Garrett tells the tale of microbes that get out of control and harm and kill humans.  These viruses and bacteria caused the diseases that make life so miserable for people way back in history, though we in the United States today tend not to think much of disease thanks to the science, technology, and sanitation that have left us free to die of cancer and heart disease rather than malaria or bubonic plague.  But there are still billions of people in areas of the world where they are vulnerable to debilitating or fatal infectious diseases, and even we in the industrialized world should be aware of the outbreaks that occur elsewhere.  The quick spread of SARS across countries shows how, in the age of globalization, disease is not just a local, or third world, phenomenon.  <br />Garrett won't teach you too much about the ins and outs of epidemiology.  For that, a textbook would be more appropriate.  Her book is more about the people who research and study these diseases and the politics of infectious disease.  She is constantly focusing on what is wrong with the systems we have in place and why we need changes.  She often repeats the term \\"iatrogenic\\" referring to illnesses caused by medical procedures, doctors, hospitals, etc.  Our negligence of systematic flaws is dangerous.<br />You will come away from this book better informed, and with a tremendous amount of appreciation for those who serve public health on the front lines.  They are a largely unacknowledged army, equipped not with guns, but with years of training, medical knowledge, and a will to to heal the sufferings of many unfortunate people.	2003-05-29

As an introdruction to the disease, how it affects people, the medications prescribed, etc., it does a pretty good job of being informative without being scientific, and avoids being dumbed down.

There are some pictures and maps, but if you actually want to know what's going on, an atlas of ancient Greece might help.<BR>  <BR>Interestingly, Hammond is especially thorough where battles are concerned and sometimes includes maps to illustrate the placement of ships or soldiers in a given battle.

You may hardly expect this slim book by novelist William Styron--a memoir, but also a literary self-analysis regarding his condition.  <br />DARKNESS VISIBLE is a revealing and engaging look into the life of a particular man who suffers this disease.  Although I can only imagine how a victim of depression would respond to such a book, I would suppose it would offer something like companionship or camaraderie with someone who has experienced what they feel others can't understand, as well as a glimmer of hope if read to the end.<br />As a reader not afflicted with depression, the book was a story that illustrated his philosophical dilemmas, agonizing psychological pain, and his experiences in a personal and thoughtful way.  If it was not as entertaining as the novels of his that I have read, I'm certain it wasn't meant to be.  But if you suffer from depression, treat people who suffer from depression, or are just interested in the affliction, you might be interested in reading about Styron's attempts to grapple with and understand this often fatal disease that strikes so many people.	2003-03-23

But that's just the price you pay for owning a cat (or two or three).  Surprisingly, A CAT NAMED DARWIN ends with a sentimental hallucination that defies credulity.  In fact, he has several hallucinations throughout the book (which aren't so mysterious when you realize he studied at Berkeley in the 60's and 70's).

Pham has a style of writing that took me a while to get warmed up to, but he writes with humor and emphathy, and a candor that makes memoirs worth reading.  <br />Contrary to some other reviewers, I don't think it's fair to expect that Pham's book be written so you can learn about the country of Vietnam and its people for your own purposes.  If that's what you want, get a Lonely Planet guide.  Besides, he does say a lot about the country and its people, albeit through his biased, \\"Viet-kieu\\" eyes.  And that's why you read memoirs--they're personal.<br />Pham deserves some praise for being crazy enough to bike from San Francisco to Seattle, throughout Japan, and from Saigon to Hanoi and back.  And his portrayal of poverty and change, of the ugliness it brings to the people he wants to love, is enough to recommend this book.	2003-03-09

There are a few interesting points here (perhaps where networks are concerned), but what is troubling is the authority Gladwell feels he possesses with the &quot;evidence&quot; he has to back up his theories.  Few of the studies he provides conclusively support his ideas, and some of the studies themselves come to dubious conclusions provided he portrayed them correctly.  <br />THE TIPPING POINT is really an example of poor social science from an author who has obviously read a freshman year psychology textbook at some point in his life, but who doesn't give much thought to what you can reasonably infer from statistical data.  He tries to explain the world with his &quot;tipping point&quot; theory and, in order to accomplish the task, he simplifies complex processes like crime and smoking to a point where his &quot;theory&quot; becomes more like a marketed product than science.  This isn't too surprising.  After all, he wants to show how marketing can change the world.<br />Gladwell says he's not a Connector.  But he's also not a Maven who's in the know.  He's a Salesman, and if you're not careful, he's likely to persuade you into buying this book.	2003-03-06

For this book, the answer is probably yes. But in reviewing this book, I have to compare it to other how-to books on drawing. Such a comparison should convince anyone that Betty Edwards is merely repackaging familiar drawing exercises with a psychological theory she finds convenient. In fact, the focus on brain laterality is useless as far as drawing is concerned, and there are other books that are more worthwhile.<br />My main concern is with the book's pseudo-scientific tone, which borders on being anti-scientific. The actual science behind Edwards' theory is scant and superficial. You just can't come to the conclusions she comes to, and the way she applies her theory is redundant. You can replace her annoying terminology of \\"R-mode\\" and \\"L-mode\\" with \\"creative mode\\" and \\"analytic/logical\\" mode, and there is no difference in meaning. It would even be clearer and more accurate to tell the reader to \\"Draw what you see, not what you think you are seeing\\" instead of saying mystifying things like \\"Shut off the buzz of L-mode, so you can mentally shift to R-mode.\\" <br />The towering giant of drawing books is, of course, Nicolaides' NATURAL WAY TO DRAW. Edwards attempts to make sense of what goes on in the brain to help us draw, but her bland writing style and her pseudo-psychological approach negates her credentials. If the book works, it is because the exercises are time-tested. The way to learn to draw is by spending time drawing, and studying the drawings of the masters. Classes help, and so do books, but if you get one book on drawing, the serious student would reach for Nicolaides.  And if you're really into neuroscience, get a recent college textbook.	2003-03-02

Buildings are everywhere, and most everyone uses buildings of various kinds for various purposes.  Yet how a building works is often a mystery.  In this way, I think buildings are much like computers; most people who use them have no clue about the inner workings of them.  <br />Edward Allen takes us through the functions of a building without going into traditional architectural theory.  This book is more concerned with the needs that buildings must fulfill, and how we can fulfull them.  He discusses water, waste, heat, ventilation, lighting, accoustics, energy, structure, and more, first by explaining each particular concept, and then by examining how problems can be solved with the knowledge of those concepts.<br />While this isn't a book on theory, neither is it a wholly practical book.  That is, it won't equip you with the skills to go and build a house.  But it will open your eyes to the various elements of buildings and building construction and you may think \\"Aha!\\" the next time you look at a building and observe a strange structural or design detail.  You don't have to be an architecture freak to enjoy the book either.  You just need to be curious.	2003-02-27

Reading requires understanding the vocabulary and structure of the language concerned.  O'Gorman begins with Vitruvius' notions of function, structure, and beauty, and relates them to a building's plan, section, and elevation drawings respectively.  Those, he claims, are the ABC's of architecture.  But he also, knowingly or not, emphasizes that the future architect or critic study another, less metaphorical, vocabulary.  It is important to know the names of architectural components and activities, and O'Gorman includes a chapter in which he recommends several dictionaries and presents some words, their meanings, and their histories.<br />For an introductory book on architecture, ABC OF ARCHITECTURE is very concise and well structured.  His text is accompanied by useful illustrations.  While he seems a bit disdainful of &quot;celebrity architects,&quot; that is fine for the beginning architect who needs a strong foundation.  The main flaw is its emphasis on Western architecture, but that is a characteristic shared by many other books.	2003-02-26

Not only are the writing style and design of the book better than the other two, it's the most emotional and thoughtful as well.  The two previous books tell of Norton's adventures as a series of events, and in this third, Gethers continues that tradition.

The feline just may be the ultimate pet, and for those who don't own cats or fear them, this story of Norton and his adventures might be a little too cute (and incomprehensible).  It's a very personal book, and not everyone may like Gethers.

Norton is not quite as prominent, and it's more about Peter and Janis and their travels through Europe, the things they did, and the people they met.  Gethers' humor is a little overdone here too.  After THE CAT WHO WENT TO PARIS, the same type of gags can get a little tiring, though it may be my fault for reading all three books at once.  The fact that I did go through all three books shows however that Gethers captured my interest, and while comparing this to the other two can only disappoint, Norton fans will probably enjoy it anyway.	2003-02-25

I can't really remember what I thought about it then; as cynical and distrustful of authority as I was, it didn't have much impact on my life.  When I reread it recently, I experienced all the things that people who love this book have already described to the point of cliche.  I couldn't put the book down.  I can't think of another book where I was so impressed with colloquial writing often filled with poor grammar.  It's one of those rare books that change on further readings, and I'm sure it will be rewarding when I revisit it later on.  <br />There's an irony to the censorship this book often calls for.  Holden tries to do some censoring himself near the end of the book.  He keeps finding a particular vulgarity written on the walls, even on a glass case in a museum.  He wants to protect the innocence of children, but he can't go on erasing this word from walls forever.  And you know that he has grown up, if only a little bit, when he realizes that you have to let kids do what they want, and &quot;if they fall off, they fall off, but it's bad if you say anything to them.  I wish the censor-crazed would grow up a little too.	2002-12-19

Like Chris Ware's JIMMY CORRIGAN, it begins by introducing the reader to reminders of traditional comic book superheros, and although the rest of the book is anything but a stereotypical comic, it retains various aspects of superhero comic books.  It's wonderfully dramatic and fantastic, transitioning from a story situated in reality to one that's dominated by mysterious deaths, apocalyptic fears, and taboo relationships.  With BORING, Clowes shows life as at once dreamy, vacuous, adventurous, and painful.  He ends up with a moving tale that is deeply structured and well worth the hour or two it takes to read.	2002-12-13

It's not a step-by-step tutorial, a mere reference book, or a book that leads you through the tools and various functions of the software.  Instead it discusses the fundamental concepts you need to know to use Photoshop to its fullest.  Some statements in the book are outdated, but fortunately, they are usually statements of opinion and occur only in a few places.  Most of the book is still applicable since Photoshop today still has channels, alpha channels, paths, layers, and calculations.  This book hasn't been updated since it was written in 1998, but it really doesn't need to be.  It's not about how to use particular tools and new features.  It's about how to think with Photoshop.  And it's deep enough to read over and over for reference.  I would encourage even beginner Photoshop users to read this book if they are really committed, especially if they want to learn about compositing.  By the end of this book, you'll be able to understand how Photoshop does what it does, and why it is such a powerful program.	2002-12-10

But it stops at the surface.  It does cover the various attributes and functions of type, and it's a very quick read (every other page is a picture), so it's definitely not useless.  But it's a scattered book that avoids depth at the expense of flashiness.  If you're serious about learning about typography, this is probably not the text for you.  If you're bored on a subway, or just curious about graphic design, it might be a fun read.

He tells bad jokes and ends up seducing Jimmy's mother.  The stage is set for a comic without heroes (or with only pathetic ones), confused children with lonely parents, and a humor that fails to conceal the underlying sadness.  <br />There's a strange two dimensionality to the images, which makes it more illustration than drawing.  Buildings tend to be drawn in elevation, interiors are in orthographic views, and simple shapes predominate.  The effect is an abstraction of the environment that crosses temporal bounds, enters fantasies and nightmares, and recollects cruel memories.<br />Like Spiegelman and Clowes, Chris Ware takes his comic into areas that are usually considered to be the territory of literature, but it would require immense effort to imagine JIMMY CORRIGAN in novel form.  The content and the form are inseparable. The story may be a downer, but ultimately it isn't depressing because it is well-told, well-illustrated, and somewhere within it is an awful truth about misogyny, race, childhood trauma, and isolation that we'd just rather not face.	2002-11-26

It is mainly about the meaning of photography at a time when pictures can be so easily manipulated and changed.  It's really a philosophical discussion of truth and ethics.  However, the middle section of the book is more about the technical aspects of 2D and 3D graphics, with explanations of the fundamental concepts that underlie digital images and compositing techniques, as well as computer modeled and rendered scenes.<br />And fortunately, both sections are great.  THE RECONFIGURED EYE is valuable both as a reconsideration of photographic truth in a the context of new technologies, and as a book to help photographers, graphic designers, architects, and anyone working with photographs to understand how the basic functions of 2D and 3D software work and why.  Though I wish there were even more photos of some of the paintings and photographs he refers to, there are many great pictures of paintings, photos, and rendered scenes to illustrate what he describes in the text.  This is definitely one of the more thoughtful books on digital images and there's a lot of good stuff here to think about.	2002-11-23

While it has aspects of both, it's more like a series of case studies, in which almost 100 designers, magazines, posters, advertisements, icons, types... are analyzed and discussed and placed in a historical context.  <br />So if you're expecting a comprehensive book on design history, this is not for you.  In no way does it feel complete for a design education.  What it does is provide thoughtful pieces to consider, and a perspective on the usage of design, originality, trends, etc.  The authors do have a point of view, but it doesn't ruin the book.  To the contrary, it makes it even more interesting.  Design isn't just art and technique  It's grounded in economics, history, culture, and politics.  Heller and Pomeroy contribute a useful set of essays to help the reader become more aware of these relations.	2002-11-17

His writing can be annoying, sounding almost like Warhol in his \\"Philosophy of Andy Warhol\\" with short, witty, curious phrases, and a distant, ironic humor that can sound condescending or careless.  Still, it turns out to be insightful and entertaining, and even informative.  It isn't that you learn something profound about how to see art or understand it.  Rather, it's like having a conversation (albeit one way) about art and particular artworks with someone who has a lot of knowledge about art and is often very perceptive.  Along the way, you learn about recent artists such as Chris Ofili, Sigmar Polke, and Richard Prince, as well as past artists like Pollock, Picasso, and Goya.  The pictures are good too.  But it's just a fun look into the issues that modern (or post-modern) art tries to tackle, and some things to think about the next time you visit a modern art museum.  Again, it's idiosyncratic and personal, so it's only one person's take on artists and art.	2002-09-22

While it would probably be confusing to learn about evolutionary theories from this book, Larson brings to light how some of those theories developed with respect to findings from the Galapagos.  By doing this, one shares in the same act of discovery that has so enchanted the various researchers who have come to the islands.  All the while, it is a wonderful read, and I highly recommend it those interested in a fascinating narrative about the history of evolution.	2002-09-20

It is also, unfortunately and too often, misunderstood and/or used to justify moral beliefs.  This book, edited admirably by Philip Appleman serves two purposes.  First, the reader is given Darwin's idea of evolution and the context in which it developed, from the scientific environment before the publication of \\"The Origin of Species\\" to selections from Darwin's various works.  Second, there are a number of excerpts that show how natural selection influenced later thought.  This includes not just the fields of science and theology, but also sociology, philosophy, and literature.<br />It can be difficult to just sit and read Darwin if you are not a biologist because it seems a little dated and obvious (at least if you are familiar with natural selection, as you should be).  Additional material provides perspective and helps to see in what ways Darwin's work was revolutionary.  Such material can also show how evolutionary ideas have been modified over time by different people.  Appleman has obviously read widely on Darwin and evolution, and the readings he provides represents an array of influential and important works.  With this book, a person can develop a much deeper appreciation of Darwin's ideas than from simply reading Darwin alone.<br />I am reviewing the second edition.  The third edition is 100 pages longer and includes more recent material, especially concerning the dispute between creationism and evolution.  I would not hesitate to recommend even the dated second edition to anyone interested in Darwin and Darwin's influence on scientists and other thinkers; this third edition should be a must-have.	2002-09-18

If you expect this treatment of economists to be dull, you will find that you are mistaken.  With his romantic use of language and biographical anecdotes, Robert Heilbroner paints a picture that lures the reader into a field that is so often mystified and abused.  I chose Economics as a major because of this book and it is still an enjoyable read.  <br />Some chapters are better than others, and those on Smith, Marx, and Keynes are probably the most interesting as well as relevant to our day.  His lofty words often border on exaggeration or spectacle when it comes to the discussion of people, but there are also analyses of thoughts and theories that are not at all complicated for the lay reader.  That said, it is not a book on economics, but rather a story about economists.  Do not expect to understand economics by reading this book.  If you don't know economics, you will learn only a general feel for what economists attempt to explain and how those explanations have changed throughout the years.  But even that, I think, is valuable.<br />The author is a socialist and it shows, but I don't feel that it is too problematic.  Until the last chapter, there are no blatant endorsements of particular views.  The analyses and criticisms are good, and if his praise of people like Marx or Keynes seems overboard, I feel that he is praising their boldness and inventiveness more than anything.  The point is that these thinkers were amazing, and their ideas changed how we perceive the world.  And as we shifted our understandings, our institutions and actions changed.  There were other thinkers involved too, and they may have been unfairly dismissed by Heilbroner.  But what comes through in the end is the passion for learning about the world.  For that, this book is invaluable.	2002-09-04

He covers the various things you need to consider and the decisions you'll have to make from figuring out the equipment you'll need, to finding a web host, to actually creating your site and getting people to notice it.  The book is definitely geared toward small business owners, but almost everything applies to people who just want to build their own personal web site as well.  Many links are contained in the book that lead to further resources, which is useful, but there are also self promotional parts of the book which can get a little annoying.  And surely, with better editing, this book could be much shorter.  But the good stuff generally outweighs the occasional plug for Peter Kent's other books or for Top Floor publishing, and though it's too long it's easy to skim over the fluff.	2002-09-02

Because of the limits imposed by its brevity, there is not much focus on Plato's personal life, or the context within which his ideas were born.  Instead there is an excellent exploration of Plato's writings that weaves through his texts and gives the reader an idea for how to approach his works.  It is not meant to be a complete and thorough analysis, but as an introduction or accompaniment to Plato's dialogues, it is a valuable book(let).	2002-08-28

Anthony Gottlieb makes the most of this space and you end up with a pretty good idea of how Socrates viewed life and intellectual inquiry, as well as the distinctions between his philosophy and that of Plato and other followers and critics.

Though it would be a shame to stop an exploration of natural selection here, it's a great starting point because it provides the context in which Darwin's thoughts came to be.  It also discusses objections and criticisms of natural selection, how it has been misunderstood and abused, and how Darwin himself treated problematic aspects of the theory.  I don't know that the illustrations and such are very revealing or useful, but they definitely make the book easy and fun to read, though the last few pages become more text-based.  Overall, it's a well executed introduction to a very influential and oft misinterpreted person.  But though this book is for beginners, please don't stay one...  go and read \\"Origin of Species.\\"	2002-08-28

With a project so ambitious, it is certain that many readers will feel some important people are left out, or that some ideas are not covered in adequate detail.  But reading through his accomplishment, it is forgivable.  \\"The Modern Mind\\" must be read as a personal work that is intricately tied to the mind of its author.  It is one person's view of intellectual history, and it is what he managed to fit in the space of less than 800 pages.<br />What is immediately clear from the beginning is that this story is molded by two thinkers: Charles Darwin and Sigmund Freud.  It is thus a tale of first, how science came to dominate our view of the world, and second, how psychology came to be so focal in our lives.  The book is roughly chronological, but the chapters are topical so it is not simply structured as a list of intellectual events.  There is form here, and one of the book's achievements is that there actually is a narrative going on, and it is interesting to see what was happening in literature or music, for instance, during the same time as certain scientific discoveries or during particular political events.  There is definitely something to be said for looking back upon a century and taking in a distant, if thin, view of how ideas developed during that time.<br />The content essentially boils down to a bunch of books and accounts taken from other books.  The older the history, it seems the more established the thinkers and their impacts are.  The more recent material has some idiosyncratic choices, though most are no doubt influential and important.  I also felt that Watson was a little too optimistic of science, and as important as science was in the book, I did not feel confident of the author's grasp of scientific concepts or of mathematics.  Are string theory and chaos theory really that important at the moment, or are they simply new and sensational?  Still, what you end up with is a very large reading list and a narrative to tie them together.  If you're interested in some famous thinkers of the past but don't know how their ideas fit into a larger historical context, this may be a good resource for you.	2002-08-22

Surely we can do better if only we expect more from our country.  He goes on to provide an amazing economics lesson for the lay reader that discusses major economic topics, recent economic issues that are highly political, large problems with our current system, and what the future might hold.  The chapters on international finance are particularly well written.<br />It's not the most recent of books, but it explains quite a lot of stuff, and most importantly, as with many of Krugman's books, you get to have a feel for the way an economist thinks.  Economics is a state of mind in the sense that the more you study it, the more difficult it becomes to connect with other people.  They just won't understand how your mind is thinking about things.  What Krugman does is to make economics quite understandable without dumbing it down to the point where most academics would discard it as popular junk.  He has strong political leanings that you are aware of if you read his column in the Times, but he is smart, and the \\"Age of Diminished Expectations\\" is definitely a good read.	2002-08-09

If you haven't been to Japan recently, your impression of the country is probably molded by economic news.  What you may not know is that while politicians and economists discuss at length the recessionary woes of Japan, a generation of young people are finding ways of rejecting and abandoning old ways of life.  There is a major societal shift occuring, and a culture is being overturned.  Many seek temporary jobs instead of long term corporate positions, many live aimlessly at home, and many others...  well, they dress like lunatics.<br />This is a book that shows this curious side of a country that, despite its status as one of the world's wealthiest nations, is the most foreign in the eyes of other industrial states.  It is a country that still operates smoothly, and many of its residents are sophisticated consumers of gadgets and technology and style.  As bizarre and fascinating as the pictures in \\"Fruits\\" are, they make you wonder if there's anything on the inside once you peel away the skin.	2002-08-01

It is a great cookbook in general.  Not content to merely compile a series of recipes, Shizuo Tsuji adds descriptions of cooking techniques unique to Japanese food, insight into Japanese culture, and more importantly he imparts valuable knowledge on how to understand and appreciate Japanese cuisine.<br />He divides the book into two parts.  The first part begins with a discussion on how meals are prepared and composed.  Then he explains ingredients, tools, and techniques that are frequently used in the book.  He ends part one with recipes that are intended to be a basic introduction to various types of Japanese food (each &quot;type&quot; employs different methods of preparation and cooking, such as frying, steaming, etc.)  The recipes are traditional Japanese meals that you would encounter if you went to Japan.<br />Part two is all recipes, again divided into the same types that part one is divided into.  However, these are slightly more complex and they build on the techniques learned in part one.<br />This is a book that can be used by beginners or more advanced cooks.  It is definitely a useful reference for all those who love Japanese food and would like to know how to make it and how to enjoy it authentically.	2002-07-28

The authors claim that while political advertising in general has the effects of educating the public by informing voters about the candidates and the issues, negative ads can lead to decreased voter participation.  Those who remain voters will tend to be more extreme in ideology and less representative of the general public.  The concern in this book is that the rise in negative campaigns can subvert the democratic process.<br />Strangely, to get to their main point, you must wade through pretty dry chapters that discuss the methods used to gather data as well as other ways that advertisements affect voter behavior.  This may be of great interest to political scientists, but for those with only partial interest, it is probably enough to read the first, fifth, and sixth chapters to get the main gist of the book.	2002-07-28

Yet there is mass confusion about what to eat and what effects foods have.  And the reason for all of this misinformation is that it benefits food producers to have an innocent flock of customers who are left uncertain of how to judge what is healthy from what is not.  She clearly explains what means the food industry uses to influence policies to their benefit, often at the expense of public health.  And she gives detailed examples that illustrate the extent to which some companies and industries go to sell their products.  <br />While her suggestions for reform may be somewhat wanting, her descriptions of how decisions about food get made on political levels is masterfully researched and she is always respectful of science.  While those people with vested interests in certain industries may label her a communist, she is merely critiquing a history of policies and marketing strategies that have, to be sure, provided us with an abundant food supply, but have also led to increased obesity and high rates of chronic diseases.	2002-07-19

The problem with the news is that it is difficult to learn about why certain things are going on and what led to those events.  BEIRUT is not a history book, but it does provide a historical perspective, and it also provides analyses of why these things are happening.  Most importantly, it gives a personal perspective, and it's filled with stories of his experiences during the decade or so that he spent in the Middle East.<br />Friedman is at his best in this book.  He manages to refrain from taking sides while writing about issues that people tend to get very passionate and emotional about.  Some people think he's pro- this or that, but I disagree.  While he certainly endorses the state of Israel, he acknowledges the mistakes it has made and the flaws it still has.  He criticizes everyone, and the Israelis and Israeli leadership are no exception.  <br />What does come through is the concern that he has for this religiously and historically significant region of the world, and for the tragedies experienced by those who reside there.  It is one person's view of the Middle East politics, and taken as such, it is very much worth reading if you are confused by the chaos there and want to know more about the region.	2002-06-24

For instance, I found fascinating the discussion of how marijuana has changed since the 70s, the description of an organic potato farm in comparison to a conventional one, and the tale of how the apple traveled from Kazakhstan to America.  <br />Yet as interesting as some of these stories were, there were many others that fell flat, like the longwinded comparisons between Johnny Appleseed and the Greek god Dionysus.  Surely, the distinction between what is or is not interesting is drawn partly by individual preference.  But I also think the structure of the book has a good deal of blame to share.<br />BOTANY OF DESIRE is divided into four parts (apple, tulip, marijuana, potato) each focusing on how these plants developed, through evolution, distinctive methods of appealing to our desires (for sweetness, beauty, intoxication, and control respectively).  The idea is that plants use us as much as we think we use them.  It's a good premise, but he doesn't stick to it in any structured way.  He never strays too far from the theme, but neither does he have much of a methodical argument.  Instead he tells stories, but at the risk of telling various, disparate ones that often ramble.<br />This is less a book to deepen your understanding of nature or botany and more a way to increase your store of food lore (in the guise of an argument about evolution).  So if that's what interests you and you like books such as Margaret Visser's MUCH DEPENDS ON DINNER, then I'd recommend this book.  It's not that great as a book on science or evolution.  But though I'm being a little hard on the book, I must admit that Pollan has made me want to start a garden.	2002-05-10

It is also an analysis of the consequences of unregulated power, and the failure of markets.  It is shocking because the reality betrays our values, and when a system of private interests and free markets is responsible, we feel powerless.  Schlosser's book takes the first step and reveals a world not intended to be seen.  Like Upton Sinclair's THE JUNGLE, which he refers to in the book, Schlosser lets us discover what the true cost of cheap food is, but only if we wish to find out.<br />He begins with the origins, with Carl Karcher of Carl's Jr., the McDonald brothers, Ray Kroc, and Harland Sanders of Kentucky Fried Chicken, and we see how suburbanization, car culture, and an entrepreneurial spirit mixed to spread fast food across the nation after World War II.  We learn how McDonald's developed their child marketing strategies and how it has resulted in the debates today over corporate sponsorship of schools.  Then a chapter on workers, the people behind the counters, why certain demographic groups tend to work for fast food restaurants, the experiences they have and the risks they face.  Finally, he writes about how the industry has become so successful, the subsidies they get, and the hype they create.  This is just the first half, and as absorbing as the book is until this point, it is the second part, away from the restaurants and to the other industries that support the fast food industry, that is mind blowing.<br />From how potatoes become fries and the chemical flavor factories that create their taste, to the modern production of beef and poultry, to the exploited workers in the meatpacking and sanitation industries, to E. coli 0157:H7 and the meat industry's reaction to it, to the levels of obesity and cultural change in other countries, each page provides entertainment as well as horror.  Through all these topics, Schlosser keeps his eye focused.  All of these nightmarish descriptions and stories are connected to the fast food industry and the unrelenting impetus for more product at less cost.  The question of the book is whether or not more product actually results in more cost.  Amputations, disease, environmental damage, and inhumane treatment of animals are externalities not included in the price of a hamburger.<br />I was surprised by the epilogue.  Despite his sardonic tone, and the almost cynical content, Schlosser provides in the end a way out.  He suggests that things don't have to be the way they are; at least one tool of leverage we have is our status as consumers and voters.  In any case, Schlosser gives a broad case study of how business is in no way a champion of free enterprise, innovation, and progress.  They demand that government not intervene, but they also demand subsidies in various forms with no conditions.  They manipulate and deceive.  They resist change.  And they can suck out the dignity of human beings to the point where their bodies are physically and emotionally incapacitated.  I am sure that even Karl Marx would be shocked by the town of Greeley, Colorado as described here, and Sinclair would probably be disappointed that almost a century after THE JUNGLE, a book like FAST FOOD NATION had to be written.	2002-05-05

I felt like I was reading some spiritual self-help book.  Though this may be the author's style and may also attract an audience, it was a little too dumbed down for comfort.  <br />Still, Robbins has spent much time on his meticulous research (even if some of his sources are biased), and there are many arguments in here whether valid or not, that you might want to think about when you decide what to eat.  Small actions like buying food at a grocery store or restaurant really do matter, and the possible consequences of your decisions might shock you.<br />FOOD REVOLUTION will surely make vegetarians feel good about what they do, provide them with some arguments for anti-vegetarians, and will probably change the way some readers eat.  But there's really nothing new here that you can't read in other books.  I think Erik Marcus' VEGAN: THE NEW ETHICS OF EATING is better at discussing the reasons why people choose to eat plant-based diets, and Virginia Messina's VEGETARIAN WAY is indispensable for understanding the nutritional aspects of vegetarian diets.  And these books don't try so painfully hard to pull at your heartstrings.	2002-05-02

Richard Rubenstein, in THE CUNNING OF HISTORY, cautions against reading the Nazi rise as a freak accident, and attempts to frame it as developing logically from the course of capitalism. Mahmood Mamdani cautions us against seeing fascism in Uganda as a result of the individual, Idi Amin.  Instead, he sees Idi Amin himself as a product of the specific conditions of the country at the time, which arose from a specific historical context, colonialism.  He argues that fascism was supported by a continuation of colonialist thought even after Independence, thus the title which associates imperialism and fascism.  Mamdani writes a brief but extremely insightful analysis of the foreign influences which shaped Uganda from the perspective of dependency theory.  He argues that Amin was a social, political, and economic phenomenon constructed not just by Uganda, but with the help of the British, the US, and the Soviet Union.	2002-04-05

It is less biography than philosophy, and it extends beyond doctors toward all people and their actions.<br />This is not to say that John Berger's observations of Dr. Sassall's life can be applied to all people.  Much is specific to Sassall's identity as a doctor.  His depression, Berger claims, is a result of \\"the suffering of his patients, and his own sense of inadequacy.\\"  But there is a theme of existentialism that underlies the book, and it is ultimately about, I think, the pain of searching for purpose after one has faced and understood absurdity.  Berger cannot conclude his essay because Sassall's essence cannot be truly captured, and his existence is not yet finished.<br />Besides being a philosophical book, it is also very personal.  It is difficult to categorize FORTUNATE MAN into nonfiction categories because it is very intellectually intimate.  It is a unique and thoughtful book, not only to be enjoyed but appreciated with effort and time.	2002-03-26

It won't teach you statistics, but it will teach you what to look out for when you read the paper and see numbers and graphs.  Since most institutions who report these data care little whether they are accurate or significant, you must rely on yourself to determine whether they are good numbers.<br />The problems with statistical data are still relevant today, and it is shocking to realize how contemporary many of his examples seem.  The problems of bias, averaging, and confusing correlation with causation all dupe even the most well-educated people, and the advantage lies with the person who can spot fallacies and not be fooled.  While learning statistics would be ideal, this book shows the first step towards understanding and critiquing statistical data.  It is not longer or more complicated than it should be, and is simple to understand.  Still, if you don't know how to evaluate some of the simple data that you come by every day in the news, this book will provide you with infinite wisdom.	2002-03-15

However, Stephen Ambrose and Douglas Brinkley are able to squeeze in a lot of history and have room left for some interpretation and analysis. RISE TO GLOBALISM is a great resource for recent US and world history, and provides a lot of the context for what occurs today in foreign affairs. Few history books are so readable and comprehensive, but the span of time and the complexity of the events cannot be adequately covered in the given pages. It is, at best, a very good summary or overview of US foreign policy. My main annoyance was with the frequent typographical errors.

Though chemistry plays a large part in the understanding of food that McGee imparts (it has to), it is very basic and a short primer in the appendix tells you all you'll need to know.  Because cooking and food underlie our very existence, and also because they are great sources of pleasure, the topic cannot but be fascinating.  However, the mystification of food abounds, and the facts are hard for most people to verify.  ON FOOD AND COOKING is a book that can be read straight through or as a reference, but will always increase your knowledge of how foods work.<br />It is comprehensive, historical, and scientific, and McGee's aim is to inform the reader enough so that s/he can cook, and also so that s/he can make decisions about food that are intelligent.  Not only does he discuss pretty much any type of food you can think of, he also discusses artificial additives, nutrition, and digestion.  And although the book was written in 1984, the advice he gives is always sound and cautious.  Food is understandable.  If you love watching PBS cooking shows, this book will enhance your knowledge of what the cooks are doing.  If you love watching the food network... well, there is probably less to understand, but it will still enhance your viewing.  In any case, if you love cooking and food, it is difficult to overlook a book of this magnitude.	2002-03-03

Then it discusses following waves of immigration and the differences between those who came to America right after the war, and those who came later, the differences in the policies facing them, as well as attitudes towards them.  The next three chapters discuss Vietnamese immigrants' experiences and attitudes on employment, education, and families.  James Freeman speaks of the immigrant group as a whole, but also tries to illuminate individual idiosyncrasies in these matters through various interviews and accounts.<br />I was expecting a dry anthropological study, but instead found that CHANGING IDENTITIES was quite interesting and very informative.  It deals with Vietnamese in America, how and why many of them came here, and their varied experiences in this country.  It is easy for a book like this to make strange generalizations that would, to a Vietnamese American, ring untrue.  And this book may make some such claims (I wouldn't know).  But James Freeman makes an effort in describing the commonalities within Vietnamese communities to emphasize also the plurality of experiences among the group.	2002-02-22

William Barrett does not bore, and he covers existentialism from its roots in Hebraism and Hellenism to its development by its most famous spokesman, Jean-Paul Sartre.  For Barrett, existentialism is a personal and relevant matter, and he passionately reminds the reader that it is a philosophy for the modern age, an age of atomic weaponry.  Though he has only four chapters on particular existentialists (Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Sartre), he also addresses various other figures such as St. Augustine, Descartes, Dostoevsky, and Tolstoy.  The scope of this work is vast.<br />The aforementioned \\"existentialists\\" have disparate views, but all share the understanding that reason has its limits, that man is alone in the world, and that to live, one must face one's own finitude.  Each thinker comes to their ideas from a unique point of view and Barrett connects their ideas with their personal historical context.  What we have is a study that is coherent and enlightening, passionate and somehow urgent.<br />But perhaps it is a little too passionate, too grandiose.  He has romantic notions of greatness, in art and in thought.  Sometimes he seems too sure of his interpretations as well, but it is up to me to go to the original sources he writes about and try his findings against mine.<br />In the end, the very fact that I desire to read directly the works of the four existentialists he writes about shows to me that Barrett has done a fine job, and he has simultaneously clarified and deepened my understanding of existentialism beyond the famous line \\"existence precedes essence.\\"  As an introduction or a supplement, IRRATIONAL MAN is an essential, and entertaining, work.	2002-02-21

Hopefully, this isn't proof of my deficiencies as a reader, but rather the success of this book in showing how difficult it is to grasp what structuralism is, let alone what thoughts these structuralists, or at least these thinkers who are considered to be structuralists, share.  STRUCTURALISM AND SINCE is a collection of five essays, one each on Claude Levi-Strauss, Roland Barthes, Michel Foucault, Jacques Lacan, and Jacques Derrida.  Each of these men focuses on different things and their approaches too are quite varied.  Yet some uniting strands seem to exist, most notably their debt to the linguistics of Saussure.<br />Though the book doesn't define or explain structuralism per se (it doesn't claim to either), the essayists provide fascinating discussions on each structuralist and their ideas.  The introduction is particularly helpful in drawing out some common themes and providing useful background.  If you are unfamiliar with and interested in these five very influential thinkers, this is a good place to discover their ideas.	2002-02-12

Since emancipation, there has always been a struggle between and among whites and blacks to figure out how to understand each other and themselves, and how to occupy the same place.  This history is indeed strange, and to have an idea of why race is still such an issue today, it helps to know how racism, segregation, and civil rights changed over time.<br />Woodward's book cautions us against taking simplified views that the South was always racist, and the North was not, and he begins by describing various accounts of life in the South right after the Civil War.  According to Woodward, the venomous prejudice that sustained the Jim Crow laws decades later wasn't foreseeable at that time.  Much of his explanation of the racist sentiment that so desired segregation is framed in the context of politics, and he tries to analyze many of the events he discusses in terms of political and economic pressures, as well as in terms of reactions to preceding actions.<br />If the Civil War is to be seen as a war for racial equality (and there are many other ways of seeing it), then it can easily be argued that it continues to this day.  It is often most comforting to think of the wiping out of Native Americans, and then the enslavement of Africans as hideous scars that America carries in the past, while believing that America today is a different, tolerant place.  But Jim Crow laws were a product of the twentieth century, and the racial tensions still exist in a very real way.  Woodward's book, first published in 1955, and last revised in 1974, is still immensely relevant today, and reading it can only enhance your sense of American history.	2002-02-07

According to Alex Marshall, the three factors that determine city form are transportation, economics, and politics.  Whether or not you end up convinced, I think he gives a good argument.<br />Marshall believes that cities serve primarily economic functions.  They are builders of wealth.  But transportation is the crucial element that determines whether a city gets dense and communal, or turns into suburban sprawl.  Economics determines how the city grows, but only after the infrastructure is laid out.  This infrastructure then, is not laid out through market processes.  Because they are public goods, it is politics that determines what kind of transportation network is built, whether roads and freeways, or rails and subways.  The latter set, Marshall argues, is necessary for healthy cities, and we should be aware that politics is the force driving transportation, because this means that we choose what kind of city we want through what kind of infrastructure we decide to build.<br />Much of the book is devoted to studies of specific urban areas that have approached sprawl in different ways.  It is also a critique of the New Urbanism movement, as Marshall argues it deals with superficial details while neglecting the underlying issues that form cities.  He goes so far as to say that New Urbanism actually creates sprawl.<br />Not all his analyses are always keen (some of his economic discussions are overly simple), and not all of his proposals may sound sensible.  But his core argument is well worth thinking about.  Marshall wants what I want: cities that are active and lively, dense and convenient, democratic and diverse.  He brings attention to government and its role, the price we must pay for having community, and his pleas are intelligent and genuine.  HOW CITIES WORK is part journalism, part instruction manual.  It's a way to understand that perhaps we can still do something to change the landscape of suburban America.	2002-02-07

AIDS and malaria, poverty and hunger continue to kill millions of people in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.  Also, while Keegan states that \\"it is poor states that mainly cause war\\" he makes no mention of the involvement (historical, political, or economic) of wealthier nations in those wars.  <br />But more importantly, though this may be an entertaining read, WAR AND OUR WORLD actually tells little about the nature of war, its origins, its transformations, and its possible future.  74 pages is just too short to even introduce a topic as wide in scope as war, and Keegan doesn't come close to providing a sturdy framework for a brief discussion of it.	2002-01-26

It is great for readers who are interested in the development of film theory and want a manageable book that follows it through in a structured way, and discusses each person's views in the context of previous thinkers'.  Each chapter considers four topics of each theorist: The basic material of film, the process that gives the material significance, the forms, and the purpose or value of film.  It doesn't cover much beyond the 1970s, but as an introduction, it sufficiently covers giant figures like Eisenstein, Kracauer, and Bazin.	2002-01-25

What it does do well is to give the not-so-foreign-affairs-minded person a swift overview of the types of globally occurring unrest that we see in the newspapers today.  I have a feeling that many people do not know much about Bosnia, Sudan, and Somalia except that violent things are happening there.  The historical background and religious settings are just not part of our grade school education.  So when James Haught discusses 28 different countries (in various degrees of depth), he hits on many major and visible conflicts.<br />However, I was pretty unsatisfied with the form of the book.  In the introduction, Haught states that his major sources are the New York Times and the Associated Press.  Indeed, almost the entirety of the book reads like newspaper articles patched together, often disparately.  As such, it is just a series of events one after the other, related to religiously motivated violence.  There is scant analysis, and the theme seems to be:  Most conflict today is caused by religion... Here are tons of articles, see what I mean?  I may be accused of academic snobbishness, but I feel that a book about fundamentalism and its horrors should be a little more analytical and more careful with its use of evidence.  The section on Kuwait is more about hypocrisy and abuse of power than fundamentalist oppression or conflict.  The chapter on the United States consists of various articles mainly about reverends and evangelists who did scandalous things, hardly on the same level as the events he talks about in other countries.  I would even say such stories are misleading, where Haught's basic thesis is concerned.<br />On the other hand, HOLY HATRED is very quick to read (pictures take up many pages, and the print is large) so if you want to feel more confident reading the International section of the New York Times, go ahead and pick it up.  But pick up some other books on the same topic whileyou're at it.	2002-01-23

He writes with an understanding of film theory and history, and also with a perspective of culture and politics, which is emphasized in the selection of these essays.  At the same time, he never gets academic to the point of dryness, though many complain precisely about this point.  Always, there is a respect for the intelligence of the reader, and he does what I think a film critic should do, which is to teach the reader something about a film, and to help him/her see it in a deeper way.  This is not the method of \\"I recommend this movie / I do not recommend this movie\\" critiquing.<br />The films he covers in this book range from those that most moviegoers have seen (Schindler's List, Star Wars) to those that even dedicated film lovers may have missed (Black Girl, Tih-Minh).  Of course, it helps a lot to actually see the film before reading the essay on the film, and it's worthwhile to try doing so.  Still, some of the films are hard to come by, and even reading Rosenbaum's essays without seeing the film(s) referred to can be a learning experience.  He supplies you with information about the film, the director, history and culture, and the film production process, and in reading him, you can't help but begin to integrate all these elements into your film viewing experience.<br />This book is entertaining and informative, and has deepened my appreciation for film.

His interest for this book is in a certain segment of the population.  The four cities he chooses are those that have been hard hit by economic downturns, and the youths he associates with and learns about are those situated in danger and immobility.  What makes the book relevant to all Americans (beyond our ability to feel a basic concern for others) is that Finnegan tackles two issues that we reluctantly, and too often simplistically, face-poverty and race.  A few more topics that constantly appear that I would consider as being born of the previous two are drugs and gangs.<br />It doesn't take much to enjoy this book.  It reads like four stories.  I had to keep reminding myself that these were true (according to Finnegan).  After the \\"stories,\\" in which Finnegan tries to keep a journalistic distance (though not always), there is an epilogue, and we see what the author is trying to get the reader the see.  There are deep questions of responsibility that run through America's laws and policies, that these questions must be asked by the citizens of the country who sometimes must choose between economic growth and economic equality.  Such consideration requires an understanding that some decisions allow a few to prosper and few to fall into deprivation.  <br />It's easy to say people like Terry and Juan are hopeless, that they will forever be in trouble, and that they deserve any punishment they get.  It's a little harder to say that when you consider that you have human beings in desperate conditions, and they will not go away simply by enforcing judicial toughness.	2002-01-21

This second time, however, I was surprised to find that Vonnegut's writing seemed almost clumsy.  And I wondered about my voracious desire in high school to read all of his books.  There may be an optimum adolescent time frame when Vonnegut speaks most influentially to his readers.<br />Still, it carries the weight I felt in the first reading, and his voice is perfect for pointing out the absurdities of tragedy.  Though Vonnegut's topic is the firebombing of Dresden, his book concerns all war and massacre.  It is about the fringes of rationality, and the attempt to find something beautiful and optimistic in a world where the darkest things can occur.  But in the end, it seems that this hopeful humanism shares the stage with another philosophy.  The Tralfamadorians set a pessimistic tone:  Time is a mere dimension, observable in an instant, the things that happen must happen, and no event is good, or bad, or sad-they are just inevitable.	2002-01-19

Honor and masculinity are integral to his character, and what he perceives in his father as laziness and femininity no doubt plays a role in his concern for these qualities. Two major events cause a major change in his life. As a result of an accident, he is cast out of his village for seven years. The other event is the coming of Europeans and their spreading of Christianity.<br />There is little idealized in the town of Umuofia, where Okonko lives. The lives of the portrayed characters is not shown to be either easy or humane. And the missionaries in this book don't bring pure evil. The converts are converted of their own accord, and due to a trading store, &quot;much money flowed into Umuofia.&quot; This book is fortunately free of moralizing. Things fall apart, but new ways are formed, and these ways may be better or worse than the old ways. Still, Achebe's novel is not blind to the destruction that the missionaries bring, and the brutality of their increasing power, which is moving towards domination.<br />Achebe shows skillfully the dilemmas and problems of two cultures clashing that misunderstand each other. I just watched Nicolas Roeg's film &quot;Walkabout&quot; a few days ago, and though they are quite different stories, they have many parallels, such as the curious ending scene. More importantly, the theme of the mystery of culture, and destruction and self-destruction remain the same. In an age where globalization seems to be the key economic topic, it is crucial that we understand the variety of life on earth, the histories we are involved in, and the need for communication and understanding.	2002-01-15

Her concern is that the focus on personal fulfillment and happiness lures us into thinking that various problems can be solved through psychology, and the more immediate causes of these problems (eg. economics and politics) get placed in the background.  Though this thesis hovers around most of the time, the book reads more like a history of therapy, divided by time period, and the problems that were focused on in those time periods (Illness, 1850-1900; Poverty, 1890-1930; Marriage, 1920-1940; etc...).<br />Moskowitz's critique doesn't extend to a serious scientific study of psychology and mental health.  Rather, her emphasis is on the type of dubious, self-help talk of guru types of people who promise happiness and betterment but who have questionable motives.  I think her ultimate goal is to get to the last chapter on talk shows and the plethora of specialized support groups, and how such a culture that embraces these things got to be.  But however fascinated I am by Oprah's popularity, there is more to therapy than TV talk shows.<br />This book is an interesing account of history and the trends in therapeutic thinking in America, though I wonder if the phases of theraputic trends (represented by the chapters) were too cleanly divided.  Just keep in mind that this book is more about pop-therapy than therapy.	2002-01-15

The fifteen replies to Van Parijs' essay provide various perspectives on the political and economic feasibility of the plan, as well as on issues of justice and fairness.  <br />The problem of this book lies in its very virtue of being a short, easy read that introduces the reader to what is considered a radical policy proposal.  And this is that it doesn't provide much in the way of analysis beyond what one might read in a newspaper.  Of course, there is a problem in being too academic:  few people might read it, and the idea may not spread (though I doubt it will spread far anyway).

To his credit, Daniel Clowes creates characters that are believable, and I'm sure there are many people out there who can relate to the story, sympathize with Enid's dissatisfaction with her life, and agree with her general view of the world.  And Clowes' treatment of his teen characters, a little cruel and unrelenting, but not cold-hearted, is refreshing.  But at the end, I didn't feel attached in any way to Enid or Becky or Josh, and didn't really care anyway.  Yeah, it was entertaining, but so what?  And though this may be a personal bias, I wasn't too fond of Clowes' drawing style, which seemed a bit clumsy and inexpressive.  I don't mean for this review to sound negative.  I did enjoy GHOST WORLD, and I would recommend it without hesitation to people who are looking for something different.  It's short anyway, and reading the other reviews, there's a good chance you'll find more to it than I did.	2002-01-05

The first review inside the cover says, \\"Starts out as one of the most pleasurable novels of the past few years.  It ends as one of the most moving.\\"  Contrary to a few other reviewers, I did not find the adventures of the characters to be un-amazing, I did not find Michael Chabon's writing to be filled with too many adjectives or difficult words (look them up, if you don't know), and I don't think his story is ultimately empty.  It is unfair, not to mention meaningless, to expect Chabon to write like Hemmingway, or to desire that this book be like some other book you previously enjoyed.  It is remarkably original and quirky, and Chabon understands the world of comic books, and what they meant for kids.  Furthermore, he understands what they meant for kids from 1939-1953.  He understands the artistic ambitions of talented youth, their dreams and disillusionments, sacrifices and compromises.  I can't speak for others, but I haven't had so much fun reading in a long time, and I must agree with the aforementioned review.	2002-01-02

Three are pictorial; four are textual.  All are about art, how art is seen, how it is valued, how it is used, and what we can learn from looking at art.<br />Of the textual essays, the first is about the mystification of art and history by its associations with assumptions and values that are not necessarily inherent in the work itself, but in its rarity, uniqueness, and commercial demand.  He discusses art as being seen as an almost religious icon, and how the reproduction of images has contributed to the mystification of the original image.<br />The second textual essay is a study of women and how they are seen, who sees them, and how they see themselves being seen by others.  It is Berger's critique of the Nude as an art form, and he argues that they place women as objects to be seen and desired and overpowered by men, the subject.<br />The third essay is about the tradition of oil paintings in Europe between 1500 and 1900.  Berger explains the connections between the content of these paintings and the ownership of them as a symbol of affluence, as products of capitalism and the maintenance of the status quo.<br />The fourth essay has to do with publicity, or advertisement, and the reference that such images make to oil paintings, sexual attractiveness, and dissatisfaction with the current state of life (the promise of a better future, given that you buy something).<br />I'm not an art historian, and I don't know much about theories of art.  But WAYS OF SEEING is a book that pierces into the comfortable notions of art as belonging to the elite and cultured, and reveals its role as used to maintain power structures.  Who commissioned the work, who is meant to look at it, what is it putting on display, what are its political motives?  These are questions that should be asked of any work of art, and Berger aims to ask these questions.  By doing so, he also enlightens the reader.	2001-12-12

Descartes is credited for the notion that the mind and body are separate entities, that man is a machine, and the phrase \\"cogito ergo sum.\\"  For these reasons, this book is worth reading.  However, Descartes makes many strange and incoherent arguments (especially concerning the existence of God), and I question the contemporary value of his philosophy.<br />One way of reading the Meditations is to see it as an argument showing that God and science are not at odds.  Instead they are compatible, and he argues even that one cannot act rightly without proper understanding.  Apparently, Descartes had been so horrified by Catholic Church forcing Galileo to recant his views that he stopped the publication of one of his papers.<br />As an attempt to make sense of what we can know, Descartes failed, and failed in some parts quite obviously.  But as in all the other philosophical writings, an argument with holes does not make it worthless as philosophy.  Its value lies in the influence it had on changing how we perceive the world.	2001-12-11

He is critical of the Bush administration's motives and decisions, and one of the merits of the book is that he brings up difficult questions about the censorship of media reports or the propaganda given by Bush and his administration.<br />The gulf war is a very important event in the Middle East, one that resulted in a miniscule number of American deaths in comparison to the casualties suffered by the Iraqis (not even including the deaths resulting from the aftermath of the war, and economic sanctions).  It was a war where it is not clear at all whether US security was in danger, and whether Saddam had any interest in invading other nations.  It was a war so closely associated in the public mind with the figure of Saddam as a demonic despot that the historical, cultural, ethnic, and religious contexts of the Middle East were of marginal importance.  It is refreshing (to me at least) to read something these days that is actually critical of the US and asks some questions about decisions made by the government that run counter to some of the core ideals of America.  Hopefully, in time, a similar book will be written about the US invasion of Afghanistan.	2001-12-10

However, if you're going to buy a book to learn statistics or probability, I would suggest a more recent book.  They may not be as brief and concise as this, but newer books would be more up to date.  One interesting thing about the Gnedenko/Khinchin book is their examples and problems, which involve things such as the production of artillery shells, or hitting targets with cannons.  It is a very welcome change from the traditional, but obvious examples that use decks of cards or dice.  Also, it says things about the audience for whom this book was originally meant, and the relevant topics of the time of the cold war.  Still, I suggest a more recent text.	2001-12-03

And despite the area's growing influence on our consciousness, our understanding of the peoples there and who they are is one of vague categories.  <br />Bernard Lewis does not offer a history in this short book, but rather a discussion of how people in the Middle East perceive themselves, and how they create and define their identities.  We often tend toward the simplified assumption that political boundaries contain single ethnic groups, linguistic groups, religious groups, but as Lewis shows, these groups are overlaid in complex ways.  <br />People who have only a Western perspective of the Middle East, and want to understand the area in a much more complex manner, should find Lewis' book to be a great introduction to the depth of the history and conflicts that exists there.	2001-11-26

In less than a hundred pages, Richard Rubenstein writes the most intelligent essay about the Holocaust that I've ever read.  I can see why William Styron was so affected by it.<br />Most books on the Holocaust discuss what happened and how.  They are, in that sense, perversely sensationalist, dealing with our visceral reactions and moral indignation.  Good writers know that a book should go a little beyond this, into wondering why it could have happened in the first place.  But fewer still make the claim that the Holocaust was \\"the expression of some of the most profound tendencies of Western civilization in the twentieth century\\" rather than \\"the work of a small group of irresponsible criminals who were atypical of normal statesmen and who somehow gained control of the German people...\\"  <br />It is indeed strange to view Auschwitz as a freak accident just because it makes us feel safe.  Unless we can discount that there were social factors that facilitated the justification of massive killings, we cannot assume that it cannot happen elsewhere, and indeed more than a few genocidal killing sprees have occurred at places other than Nazi Germany in the twentieth century, though perhaps without the intense bureaucratic organization.  Rubenstein's question is why did this happen in the first place, and the answers he gives are conditions that exist in many countries, including America, today.<br />The Cunning of History is engrossing and enlightening, and still carries with it enormous power.  Even in America where we consider ourselves free and just, some lives are valued more than others, whether because of race or financial success or some other invalid reason.  History is cunning because it deceives us; Rubenstein's fear is that even if we know what happened and how, history may still likely repeat itself.	2001-11-26

It is one of the effects of mass production that we have very little idea how our products are produced, and for those people who share an interest for food, why people eat what they do, and the beliefs people hold about food, this book will be fascinating.  It is not just a collection of tidbits of useless trivia; there is a steady theme of the food being discussed in each chapter.  At the same time, it is not just about the particular foods she chooses as her chapter titles.  With Visser, you find out that not only do our behaviors of consumption have far reaching effects that are largely unnoticed by the general public, but also that the foods we eat have long, unthinkable histories that determine our attitudes towards them.	2001-11-15

Much of the book is on how communism has been implemented, and that mostly in Russia, but that is probably as it should be.  The focus though is on the (bloody) consequences of communism.  I think the pace of the book is right on, and there is a great deal of information to be found in it; after finishing, it seems like you've read a much longer book.   As such, I think it serves as a fairly successful example of the Modern Library Chronicles series, the point being to cover large topics in few pages.<br />Pipes does not regard communism highly and his bias pervades the entire book.  But that is not necessarily a bad thing.  He is not ashamed of his opinions and they are very evident when they appear.  So whether or not you agree with his opinions, it is easy to see what those opinions are, and it is also clear why he holds those views.  Still, he provides a very penetrating analysis, and while nobody should stop here in a study of communism, it makes for an engaging introduction.	2001-11-15

After some information about the author and the novel, Gary Cox discusses the six parts and epilogue and covers certain symbols, ideologies, character types, and character relations as well as other aspects of the novel.

Spiegelman's comic is told by Spiegelman himself, who wants to write a comic book about his father, Vladek, who survived the Holocaust. Vladek's story is told by himself through Spiegelman. This allows for the narrative to go outside of the Holocaust, and into the author's life, his difficulty in dealing Vladek, his guilt for his mother's suicide, and the impossible task of trying to comprehend what his parents struggled through.<br />This is a deeply engrossing book, and because it is in comic form, few people should find it difficult to read. Both volumes can easily be read in a day or two and it should be rewarding and worth your time.	2001-11-12

It is almost a philosophy book, albeit one that uses scientific ideas to explain how we behave and why we do so.  The central premise is that we evolved, and because we evolved, our brains are products of natural selection.  The first half of the book explains how this is possible, and how the brain itself processes information in various ways.  The second half is probably more interesting to most readers (including me), but only because the discussion on how the brain operates changes to a discussion on our instincts and desires, with a great chapter on relationships with other people.  It is at times tedious to read, but it's not a difficult textbook (almost pop-cog-sci) so if you're interested in cognitive science, you might enjoy it.	2001-11-09

Donald Palmer tells the story of some major thinkers of the West in simple language and illustrations, and yet manages to avoid treating the reader as a child (though a child could read this book and learn much).  He provides a quick overview of Western thought from the early Greeks to twentieth century Poststructuralists for readers who are interested in philosophy but have never encountered it.  This is a better introduction than Palmer's \\"Does the Center Hold?\\" which is organized by topics of philosophy rather than chronologically.  However, if you are seriously interested in philosophy, you will want to read more, and he provides a good bibliography with suggestions for primary and secondary sources at the end.	2001-10-31

Hirsch argues that literacy doesn't just depend on our ability to read, but also on whether or not we have the knowledge that the author assumes that we have.  When we speak to others about a given topic, we can speak more fluently if everyone has general knowledge about the topic; if not, then much explanation must be done, and much time will then be wasted.  <br />Many people will take issue with his list of what \\"literate Americans\\" should know, but few can deny that people do need to share collective knowledge in order to communicate effectively, and that we would all do well to learn as much as we can about things that shape our culture and nation, regardless of whether or not we agree exactly on what things they are.	2001-10-24

The other three, in comparison, are frankly boring, so it might be worth your money to buy the Oresteia separately.

It covers epistemology, ontology, religion, freedom, ethics, political and social philosophy, and art.  Donald Palmer includes some people quite a lot (Plato, Marx, Freud, Sartre) while there are many philosophers who are not mentioned at all, but considering the number of philosophers and their numerous ideas, this may not be a fair objection.<br />What makes this book different from others is that it is very light reading.  It isn't condescending, or excessively simple, but Palmer writes in a conversational manner and with a frank, sometimes humorous tone.  And you see how no philosophical ideas, however convincing, are free from being challenged and scrutinized.  This may not be a book you refer to time and again, but for a relaxed and entertaining introduction to different branches of philosophy, Palmer does a fine job.  Tedious and confusing language is something you won't have to worry about.	2001-10-14

The focus is on education, where the topic of multiculturalism is most apparent, and Glazer explains what multiculturalism is about, and what the arguments for and against it are.  He is especially concerned about \\"civic harmony\\" and whether multiculturalism highlights differences between people at the expense of defending the view that America is a country that has been trying to move towards inclusion.  He goes on to attack what he sees as the excesses of the multiculturalist movement in showing the absurd emphasis on topics in history that are insignificant or false.<br />It takes a few chapters before the book develops its central theme.  At this point, it begins to discuss identity, diversity, and the possibility of cooperation and equality.  Glazer's argument is that multiculturalism is essentially a black phenomenon, and that it has gained momentum because America has been unable to assimilate blacks in the way that it has done so with European immigrants, Asians, and Hispanics.  The reason for this, he maintains, is that blacks have a different history than immigrants, and a  reaction to prolonged inequality had to result.<br />Many people will disagree with Glazer's views.  But fortunately for you, it is very evident where he stands, and he is candid in displaying what he believes.  Regardless of whether you agree with him, this book contains a good deal of information about the history of multiculturalism that anyone interested can benefit from.  Indeed, multiculturalism is here to stay, and we should all know what it's about.  Here's one educated point of view that is, if not always agreeable, very temperate and reasonable.	2001-10-11

There is no math (which may or may not be a good thing) and the few graphs are of the basic supply and demand curves which are simple to understand at this level, and which you can't really pass up when learning economics.  Heilbroner and Thurow discuss the major economic concepts like GNP, inflation, the role of government, monopolies, etc. and they do a good job describing them and explaining how things work.<br />There is a liberal bias.  The authors are not blind to this, and they do try to exhibit different viewpoints, and they try to point out when they are stating their own stance.  If you want an unbiased view of economics, you will probably have a difficult time finding that one book that meets your standards-if anything, it will be the book that most closely agrees with your own biases.  If you want an unbiased view, read many books, read textbooks, read news from several sources, and then come to your own conclusions.  I don't think the biases in this book really disturb the education you can receive from this book.  Just be aware that they exist.<br />If you didn't find this book exciting, like the 15 year old reviewer, it may be because you were not part of the intended audience.  Heilbroner and Thurow wrote this book for those who \\"want to understand the nature of the economic forces that are upsetting their lives.\\"  In the modern world, people need to know some economics in order to be in full control of their lives.  If you read nothing else but this, you will at least be able to read business and financial news with greater understanding and perhaps participate in economic discussions.	2001-10-10

Though I don't agree with every detail of his loose examination of bobo life and psyche, it's quite descriptive given that it has little data or concrete evidence to support its points.  <br />Brooks begins with a very insightful first chapter, which introduces us to the changes that have taken place at educational institutions since the 1950s.  As the WASP aristocracy gives way to a more meritocratic elite, bourgeois values are overtaken by bohemian ones.  And as the educated elite discover just how valuable their minds are monetarily, the bourgeois and bohemian merge, and now we have an ambiguous class which Brooks calls Bobos.  <br />Simplistic?  I think so.  But any such model of a class as large as America's educated \\"elite\\" is going to be inaccurate and simple to an extent.  But much of what he writes is observable (which also makes it funny, though sometimes his humor gets tiring).  So when he talks about latte towns with \\"upscale retailers, gourmet bread stores, handmade furniture outlets, organic grocery stores... a used bookstore with shelves and shelves of books on Marxism... an African drum store or a feminist lingerie shop,\\" there's no doubting that these areas exist, and didn't exist before Bobos.  It is when he gets into what Bobos think, or what they accept and don't accept, that it sounds right on, but it's not necessarily credible.<br />Brooks spends much of his time describing the behavior of Bobos.  Six of his seven chapters are titled Consumption, Business Life, Intellectual Life, Pleasure, Spiritual Life, Politics and Beyond.  However, there is a lot more than the description of how Bobos behave and what they want.  Included in most of the chapters is a historical perspective, and Brooks, using many other sources like William Whyte, Jane Jacobs, Mike Nichol's \\"The Graduate,\\" discusses what social forces created Bobos.  Knowing what Bobos buy isn't that hard to figure out, at least if you live amongst them.  Knowing how they came to be is much more interesting.<br />Brooks makes fun of Bobos, but treats them as benevolent beings for the most part, and when he does make fun of Bobos, it is not in a critical manner-in fact, there is rarely a page with any kind of serious criticism of this Bobo class (in the end, he talks about their complacency as a possible flaw).   Also, I would like to have read some more about the relation of Bobos to non-Bobos. He says little of those who strive to be Bobos and are perhaps unable to enter into Bobo-hood.<br />Entertaining and, at times, very perceptive, but maybe a little one-sided.  If you like books like \\"Lexus and the Olive Tree,\\" you might find this to be another enjoyable popular nonfiction book that tries to describe the state of the current world.  But I couldn't help but read this with a little unease.  For all the praise he gives Bobos, it might be wise to be wary of this new class.	2001-10-04

She does not mean to explain the teachings of Buddhism per se, though by reading about the Buddha's experiences, you can't help but implicitly learn his basic philosophy.  As such, I felt that Armstrong's book adequately introduces the reader to the life of Siddhatta Gotama.  She explains most unfamiliar concepts with care, and often makes comparisons to other religions with which the intended readers are probably more familiar.  She discusses the limitations of the sources she used to piece together Gotama's life, and tries to keep the essence of the story true, even at the expense of historical accuracy or scientific possibility.  And for these things, she will invite criticism.  But her attempt was noble and even successful, and if you're curious about the Buddha, I recommend her book.	2001-09-27

(Reflective Bioethics)	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Medicine and philosophy	We do still need doctors, of course, and will probably need them far into the future.  What John Lantos really explores is what role will they play?  What role do they play now?  What is their relation to the patient?  How should they be trained?  What decisions should they make?  Is it right for us to spend so many resources on a few patients who want expensive operations when for the same cost, we could promote the public health of hundreds, perhaps thousands?<br />Through examples, Lantos shows the reader how difficult some choices in the medical world are.  Often, there is no right answer, and sometimes all the answers seem wrong.  Though he does speak his opinions, he rarely gives an answer to the problems he displays because there are no true answers.  The examples he gives come from his own personal experiences, stories published in journals or discussed in forums, and some of the most interesting examples are fictional, from literary works.  The ethical dilemmas he presents are interesting to think about in their own right, but they may also have a practical value in that you may have to face one of these situations at some point in time if not already.  <br />If we really want to change the way health care is performed in America, we have to think about what we want from our doctors and how we want to be treated for diseases and conditions.  We have to think about the dilemmas that doctors face, and those that patients face, as well as the decisions that family members may have to make.  We have to understand that there are many parties that have different interests arguing different things.  We may never know exactly what the right things to do are, but shouldnt we at least wonder?	2001-09-26
US	44776887	R1TEKM9EJBZ5BU	0679721037	150142267	Hiroshima	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Burden of memory	\\"Hiroshima\\" is about the people who experienced the destructive powers of the atomic bomb firsthand. It does not tell you whether the bomb was a necessary evil, or whether the US should have found alternative methods of victory. It only attempts to describe the lives of six people who were in Hiroshima that day, what they saw and what they did. In this book, the ethics of the bomb are not the issue, though it can be argued that it is anti-bomb or anti-war because it doesn't put the war in context. But given the scope of the book, the context isn't necessary. The bomb had consequences; to deny that is to put patriotism over humanity.<br />There are some quirky reviewers here who mention that this is a \\"novel.\\" \\"Hiroshima\\" is not a work of fiction. John Hersey interviewed several people who were in Hiroshima at the time of the atomic bomb and survived, and this is the story of six of them. He originally meant to publish the contents serially in the New Yorker, hence the four chapters (A Noiseless Flash, The Fire, Details are Being Investigated, and Panic Grass and Feverfew) that are separated chronologically, each discussing all six people in that particular time frame. This is probably why the form of the book was confusing for some people who didn't like going from one person's story to another, and back again (though I personally found it easy to follow). Eventually it was decided that the four chapters should be published as one article, taking up most of the August 31, 1946 New Yorker magazine. The aftermath was written forty hears later and comprises almost half the book. It is a follow up on the people and is just as relevant-the bomb would have its effects long after most people began to forget.<br />If you want to know about the bomb and how it relates to World War II, then there are many other sources out there. But &quot;Hiroshima's&quot; value lies in its portrayal of the sheer horror of the power of atomic weapons. The discussion of whether the existenceand use of weapons of mass destruction can be justified might be eternally debated. But that debate must include the consequences of what can happen to human beings and the conditions in which they live. I first read this book in sixth grade, and the words \\"He reached down and took a woman by the hands, but her skin slipped off in huge, glovelike pieces\\" has never left my mind.	2001-09-23

This view of the world has many implications.  Helping these developing countries becomes a matter of charity and we wonder what is so wrong with these places that they cannot achieve economic growth and prosperity.  And we must consider the question of whether increasing per capita incomes can really make people better off.  What if services such as health care and education are sacrificed?  If women are discriminated against, and if the citizens cannot vote?  It is not adequate to discuss the goals of development in terms of per capita GNP.<br />Amartya Sen would ask us to view development in the frame of freedoms.  The ends of development, he argues, are not wealth or productivity, though these can be instruments to achieve certain freedoms.  To see the increase of the well being of others comprehensively, we must understand how \\"well being\\" is achieved and focus on increasing the freedoms of people.  These freedoms include political, social, and economic freedoms and they tend to reinforce each other.  Making people better off requires that policy makers keep these goals in mind.<br />Sen's book is an articulate, fully developed argument.  It is a mixture of economics and philosophy and it is written for a layman, without condescension.  That is, it may still be a little difficult to read if you aren't used to academic writing.  Those who finish this book, however, may end up seeing development, freedom, and social justice in a fresh and hopeful way.	2001-09-21

Virginia Woolf suggests that she is an amateur in this matter, and, due to her lack of formal education, finds it difficult to properly research the topic.  However, she proves herself competent in making a coherent argument that is convincing, though her conclusions are no longer very surprising.  It is difficult to argue against her, to say that women, who have had substantially lower incomes than men and have faced many stigmas and prejudices are not disadvantaged in producing works of literature or art or in making intellectual contributions.<br />As I said, her argument is no longer new.  Most people probably do not have to read this book in order to agree with her main thesis.  But she does make a few interesting points about the role of women in literature and what the effects of increased freedom for women might be.  For the method of the argument alone this book has value:  \\"...one cannot hope to tell the truth.  One can only show how one came to hold whatever opinion one does hold.\\"  She does not ask you to agree, but only to understand why she thinks what she does.	2001-09-14

When I first read this years ago, I was surprised how moved I was by such a simply written play, but on reading it a second time, I was bored. It's too straightforward for my taste, and the theme can be summarized quite nicely in a couple words: Carpe diem, or something like that.

But it is a very good one, and shows how William Styron, even in his youth was a talented and perceptive writer.  This novel begins with the death of Peyton Loftis, and goes back in time to follow her childhood and coming of age, as well as her eventual marriage, until her death.  We see these pictures through the alternating points of view mostly of her father and mother, but also of some other characters, and learn how her death was inextricably related to the slow attrition caused by stubborness, jealousy, and hate that tears apart her family.  Darkness is everywhere in the novel, taking the form of guilt and personal failures that corrode the hearts of each character and make inevitable Peyton's tragic end.  Indeed the predetermination is all the more evident, since we know from the very beginning that she has died.<br />Although Sophie's Choice shows how much more polished (and more thoughtful too, perhaps) he has become as a writer, Styron's writing is beautiful, as are the characters and the story.  This may not be a necessary read, and the beginning may be slow, but it was well worth my time.	2001-09-08

I had seen some revealing clips of the film adaptation on the Charlie Rose show during an interview with Meryl Streep. So arriving at the climactic point of Sophies Auschwitz story, I wasnt surprised, having already anticipated the reason for the title. But what I couldnt anticipate was the breadth of the novels story, the details of Styrons descriptions, the allure of the three main characters, and the fullness with which I was thrown into the post-war setting and my inability to escape that world after I had finished the book. To say that this is a Holocaust novel would be entirely accurate, but the description would fail to capture the scope of the book. It takes place in New York, and is narrated by a sexually frustrated, aspiring writer from the south named Stingo. He meets Nathan, an American Jew obsessed with the Holocaust who sometimes acts out abusively, and Sophie, a beautiful Polish Auschwitz survivor who slowly reveals her past, and her painful relationship with Nathan, to our narrator who is secretly in love with her. But what keeps me thinking about the novel is not just the story, but how well Styron tells it. He brings in so many vivid images and descriptions that I could not help but feel that the characters were concrete and once existed, and what they went through was real, and the depth of their personalities attracted me in such a way that the pain I felt upon finishing the book had less to do with Sophies personal tragedy which occurred at Auschwitz, but with the trio's tragedy after the war in New York. Because Styrons story isnt really about the Holocaust, but rather its aftermath. It is so affecting because you see the psychological damage inflicted on Sophie by her experience to the extent that her life afterwards would be so miserable. Her one small source of happiness is Nathan, who is himself suffering, unable to escape both his guilt and his madness. And Stingo, as much as he wants to help the two people he cares about most, is unable to do anything at all.	2001-08-25

He knows that we love to hear sad stories, and disasters always catch our attention.  There are many moving stories here told by Rwandans he interviewed, and they effectively portray the suffering that Tutsis suffered at the hands (or rather, machetes) of their friends and neighbors.  <br />But when something happens like the events in these accounts, you eventually stop marveling at the gruesome nature of the slaughter, and you instead wonder about how such a thing happened in the first place, and why, with the world as witness, so little was done to prevent or end it.  The story of Rwanda is disturbing because you can't just read this book the way you would watch \\"Schindler's List\\"-that is, fifty years after the fact, with a clear delineation between good and evil, knowing that we were not on the side of evil.  These massacres occurred in 1994.  America and other industrial nations were aware of it, and we didn't play the good guys.  We let it go on, while we absorbed OJ Simpson's crime drama as it unfolded on TV.<br />Covering the story from before the genocide to its aftermath, Gourevitch is clearly disturbed by the lack of international response to the situation, and our half-hearted attempts to help.  The real moral questions of this book concern not just Hutu Power and their propaganda and ethnic hatred, but also us.  Discussions of whether America should have intervened in the crisis always involve questions of what our \\"national interests\\" are, but do we have the right to feel such indignant, self-serving rage when we hear other stories about the Holocaust if we are unwilling to act when Tutsis in Africa are being killed as a race?<br />The stories that the people involved tell in this book are chosen well.  Gourevitch wants to gain insights from the interviews into what exactly was going on, and how such seemingly inhuman acts could occur.  If he did not succeed in finding all the answers to his and our questions, he at least imparts a work that seriously investigates a tragic and troubling event that should affect anyone interested in the global community.	2001-08-21

Instead, Thomas Nagel takes a different approach, and introduces the reader to a few big questions that philosophers have tackled, without referring to philosophers of the past or present other than himself.  <br />He says at the beginning that his book is \\"for people who don't know the first thing about the subject\\" and \\"before learning a lot of philosophical theories it is better to get puzzled about the philosophical questions which those theories try to answer.\\"  The questions are ones that you have probably wondered about already, if only for a moment, and Nagel presents them and discusses each of them, adding more and more questions while leaving the reader to ponder them.  <br />It's a short read, but too short.  Obviously, this was Nagel's intention.  But though this book might be good for high school students, I was left feeling as if what I had read was more of an introduction to an introduction to philosophy.	2001-08-17

It is useful as an introduction to the theories of socialism, capitalism, fascism, and communism, but most people already have some idea of what these things are about.  The greater benefit in reading this book may be in learning how these ideologies have been put into practice in different countries.  In each section, the authors discuss the history and theory of the ideology, how it has been implemented, and then some other issues that relate to the topic.  I was most curious about communism, and was glad to find that almost half the book is devoted to it.  This book is for those who want a quick and informative overview on the varieties of political thinking that have been influential and continue to be influential in our world.  In attempting to understand other nations, it is necessary to have some understanding of the politics that have shaped them.<br />The edition I read was the tenth.	2001-08-15

You begin learning about motion, and then electricity and magnetism, and it's almost impossible to see a coherent connection between the ideas.  Many people have heard of relativity and quantum theory, but do not have even a general notion of what they aim to explain.  <br />Like mathematics, you can learn physics without knowing about the people behind its development (though you will encounter many of their names in important expressions), but it never hurts to study how such ideas began, and how they came to be what they are today.  Einstein and Infeld's book is aptly titled.  They show how and why certain concepts came into being and what significance they hold.  Beginning with \\"The Rise of the Mechanical View,\\" they describe vectors, motion, forces, and energy.   With \\"The Decline of the Mechanical View,\\" they show how the behavior of electricity, magnetism, and light waves poses problems for the mechanical view.<br />The next two (and most interesting) sections explore field, relativity, and quanta, and how they have proved more accurate in describing physical phenomena than what was previously known.  Einstein and Infeld describe everything with a minimum of mathematics so that anyone with an interest in the development of physics can understand the contents.  Although such math is necessary for a precise understanding of physics, the aim of the authors, which they frequently repeat throughout, is to give the reader a broad understanding of the general underlying principles.  They have succeeded in giving an account of where the human construction of physics started, what has been covered since then, and where it is heading.  It is a simply written book, suitable for readers who don't know physics and want to learn, but also helpful for students of physics who want to see a broader picture of its evolution.	2001-08-07

The prisoner's dilemma itself is a central point, but this book is more about \\"John von Neumann, Game Theory, and the Puzzle of the Bomb.\\"  In a sense, William Poundstone takes the prisoner's dilemma as a reference point, and looks at its history.  As he does so, he provides a brief biography of John von Neumann, discusses the development of game theory by von Neumann, its further development by the other members at the RAND Corporation, and game theory's relevance to the nuclear bomb and the cold war.  <br />As fascinating as all this was (and he tells the story well), I was most interested in the final third of the book which discusses games other than the prisoner's dilemma: chicken, the volunteer's dilemma, deadlock, stag hunt, the largest-number game, and especially the dollar auction.  The games are described not just in terms of numerical payouts, but in situations that can be imagined in real life.  And Poundstone also mentions game theory in relation to evolution, and tit for tat strategies in iterated prisoner's dilemmas.  <br />This is a book for the general reader.  You need not be a mathematician to understand the contents.  Indeed, it is a pretty simple book, and you will only learn basic aspects of game theory if you haven't encountered it before.  What you can expect is a story about von Neumann and the cold war and the interesting paradoxes that such situations create.	2001-08-05

Whether you agree with the Random Walk theory or not is almost irrelevant.  A person who is seriously interested in investment should find that this book is informative.  Burton Malkiel does not believe that you can consistently outperform the market, but the message is less important than how his argument is approached.<br />Malkiel begins by discussing how stocks are valued and provides two theories: the firm-foundation, and the castle-in-the-air theory.  The former is the idea that firms have \\"intrinsic value,\\" a theory that value-investors espouse, while the latter is a speculative approach that deals with human psychology.  He then tries to figure out whether or not these theories are practical.  If applied, can you make money in the market?  Most popular books on investing can probably be fit into one of these two categories so this question is important.  In his analysis, Malkiel concludes that there is no reason to find either theory attractive.  If you disagree with him, however, it doesn't make his book worthless.  His discussion on the theories is what is valuable.<br />He then discusses the academic discoveries of modern portfolio theory, the capital-asset pricing model, and a little bit of arbitrage pricing theory in simple terms in order to explain the attempts that have been made to measure risk.  The most important concept here for the lay reader is modern portfolio theory, which is usually explained in books as \\"you should diversify to reduce risk.\\"  Here, Malkiel explains why this is so, and he does this without using standard deviation and covariance measurements.<br />Finally, he takes on attacks to his argument, and offers various counter-arguments.  Then the last section offers advice to investors-a sort of financial planning guide based on the material in previous chapters.<br />The value of thisbook lies in the way he presents his material, and his explanations of various ways of thinking about asset returns, risk, investor psychology, and diversification.  Few other books for the general reader on investment are as informative as this, and Malkiel's ideas have a strong foundation.  After all, the average investor won't beat the market.  He can't.  And you can't publish information that will allow you to continuously find inefficiencies in the market, because though there may be opportunities to profit at first, they will eventually disappear as more people find them.  So it is sound, I think, to advise no-load indexed mutual funds.<br />Some of the negative responses here are very reactive.  It is as if, by arguing for the Random Walk theory, Malkiel has spoken a personal insult.  Judging by the reviews, many seem not to have read the book completely, or even at all.  Some reviews decry academia altogether, and say nothing else, and some misinterpret the author (he does not believe that inefficiencies don't exist).  Such reviews should be read with caution.  If you do hate academia for some personal reason, don't read this book.  If you are a proud and firm believer that you can consistently take advantage of market inefficiencies and come out on top, and if you can't stand someone questioning such a position, don't read this book.  But those who have only read investment books that have little evidence and theoretical background and want something a little heavier, something to expand their understanding of how to think about investments, I find this book to be a worthwhile choice.	2001-08-02

With this bias, I can still say that it is a book that is much easier to read than a textbook, and does not have millions of practice problems.  So it would be great for a review of the subject, and *if* a beginner can follow it, then it would be great to learn from.  At the very least, you will get the feel of calculus and what sort of problems it is intended to solve.  Martin Gardner tries to clarify a few outdated things, and he writes about some additional problems related to calculus at the end of the book.<br />Of course, if you are looking to learn calculus in depth, this book probably will not suffice.  It can't possibly cover what a first year college textbook on calculus does.  But many people understandably do not want to trudge through difficult proofs and definitions, repetitive problems, and a thousand pages of text (though these are the things that sometimes pound concepts into your head).<br />A good read for a quick overview of calculus.  Expect to solve some of the problems, if you want to learn something.  And pay attention because near the end, it gets pretty difficult.	2001-08-02

But having finished it and looking back, I think I see more clearly what he was trying to say.  He makes a persuasive case that life moves toward complexity and does a good job explaining why.  With its great scope and ambition, this book is very similar to Jared Diamond's \\"Guns Germs and Steel.\\"  Diamond's book looks at how and why different cultures came to have such differing levels of technologies and power by using evolutionary biology, while Wright tries to show that biological and social evolution have a directionality, and he uses game theory.  <br />However, Diamond's book was more solid in keeping to its thesis, and he had much more evidence to go on.  The structure of his book is also clear.  Wright is convincing, but at times his examples become simplistic, and when he ventures into areas of \\"purpose\\" and \\"meaning,\\" the book suffers.  Such critiques are probably not due to Wright's thoughts being simple, but rather to the book's writing style, which seems a tad dumbed down in order to reach a mass audience.<br />However, Wright does say a lot, and to use a field of economics to explain not just human commercial interactions, but also cellular interactions, and even evolution and culture is quite a feat.  If you're interested in these broad, sweeping explanations of history, this is for you.	2001-07-28

Though it also contains stuff about other issues and problems that many vegetarians encounter, the main value of this book lies in the nutritional information it contains.  The book goes through what vitamins and minerals are needed, why they are needed, where to find them in vegetarian foods, and what studies have shown about vegetarians and their relations to these nutrients.  There are larger chapters discussing protein and calcium, which are the primary concerns that people who don't know much about vegetarianism seem to have.  Messina is a registered dietician and cites her references carefully.  She tries not to make any unfounded claims, though she cites correlational studies whose conclusions are more unclear than she makes them seem.  For the most part, the information is very much consistent with current knowledge of nutritional science, and if you are a new vegetarian who is unsure of where to start, this book will prove to be extremely useful in understanding why other people become vegetarians, how such a diet affects certain illnesses, how to address the special needs of infants, children, teenagers, pregnant women, athletes, and how to start planning and preparing vegetarian meals.  Of course, it's a big change to alter your dietary habits, so you want to read many other books as well.  And cookbooks will no doubt be helpful.  But you can't go wrong starting with The Vegetarian Way.	2001-07-16

But as informative as it is, I felt it was written poorly. Though the ideas are good, the first few chapters read like a generic self-help book so I found myself skimming through the entire book and trying hard to find the important points that are worth reading.

I liked how it was structured.  Giswold covers the various aspects of going to a gym, or working out at home, and other factors that affect the experience of working out.  The exercises are clearly explained for the most part, and the programs he has are reasonable.  Giswold is not condescending and he is not trying to fool the reader with irrelevant or misleading information.  He attempts to sensibly define a good way to get in shape and look good, and I think he does so successfully.  <br />I suspect many men will run for cover when seeing the pictures; it is hard to deny their homoeroticism.  But they're just pictures of half-naked (or naked) men, and to not read the useful text due to that would be unfortunate.  The section on diet I think is not very useful, but the idea is that diet and exercise complement each other when your goal is becoming fit.  The section on meditation may seem unnecessary to some readers, but it's just a small section.  If you want to work out and get in shape, and you don't know where to start, or you want to enlarge your exercise library, then I recommend this book highly.  Still, if you don't make the effort, you won't gain anything.	2001-06-21

The rest of the book is filled with personal stories of some of his clients, many who are celebrities, and descriptions of the dangers of misusing your voice, and his thoughts on social causes of vocal abuse and misunderstandings of how to correctly use your voice.  Maybe some people enjoy reading this.  I think that about one fifth of the pages would have sufficed to contain all the practical information.  <br />Having said that, I was mindlessly practicing saying \\"Umm-hmmm\\" and some of the other words he recommends while reading the book.  At the end, where he reviews the exercises, I was surprised to find that my voice did indeed feel and sound more resonant and stable with more volume control.  If Mr. Cooper is responsible for this change which occurred in a few hours (if it occurred at all, and I'm not entirely convinced), then I feel I owe at least three stars instead of two.

US	44776887	R2F2C4MVI81LID	0374525749	627065254	The Odyssey	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Great translation	Robert Fitzgerald does an amazing job in both The Odyssey and The Iliad in bringing out the feel of epic poetry and keeping the flow of words smooth and quick.  The tale of Odysseus is still exciting many centuries afterwards, and anyone who loves literature will waste no time in attempting to read of it.  I have read it once in high school, but only upon a repeated reading years later do I appreciate it much more.  Though The Odyssey lacks the tension and philosophical dilemmas in The Iliad, this is still an enjoyable poem, and it is difficult not to be awed by the talent of Homer.	2001-06-12

Gotcha is filled with very different types of puzzles than aha! Insight, which has many problems to solve.  This book just presents many fun paradoxes that make you use your head, and while some of them are problems you have to take some time to solve, most are short paradoxical situations that you can think about for a short while and then go on the next page.  It is easy to read, and Gardner again shows his skill in explaining interesting phenomena in a clear and interesting way.  All the problems are good exercises on logical thinking and introduces various concepts of mathematics and statistics without seeming like you're studying.  It is insightful enough for adults, but I think children would be able to understand these concepts too if they are interested.	2001-06-10

Readers who are interested in Buddhist philosophy and the life of Buddha, can learn much in this fictional tale in a couple hours.<br />But this is not just a work of fiction.  For one thing, Siddhartha's life roughly parallels the actual Buddha's.  But also, this book surely has a practical purpose, and so it seems more like a parable.  What are the important things in life?  How do we appreciate life?  What teachings do we follow?  What makes us happy?  These are questions we all have (most of us, at least) at some point in time, and Siddhartha's whole life story is about finding these answers.  He seeks happiness by taking on many forms, from ascetic, to merchant, to ferryman, and finally, when he stops seeking, he comes to understand what wisdom is.<br />The individualism in the book spoke to me strongly.  Though he is seeking enlightenment, and though he seems to agree with the Buddha's teachings, Siddhartha rejects the opportunity to become a follower and learn from him.  He figures that the Buddha himself arrived at enlightenment not through teachings, but through experience.  And so, with the thought that wisdom is not communicable, he seeks it through his own experiences as well.  And here is the real message beyond what he explains at the end.  You have to seek your own way.  You have to learn through experience and perhaps even suffering.  And you have to contemplate and listen.  In some way, you even have to reject this book itself.  It isn't going to enlighten you.  After you read it, you must go out into the world and enlighten yourself.	2001-06-05

I had never heard of him, and would not have read him if he weren't noted in the reader's list of the Modern Library's top 100 novels. And how unfortunate it would have been had I not picked up this book!<br />The Cunning Man is an examination of the life of a doctor, told by himself. Asked to recall the story of the strange death of Father Ninian Hobbes which he witnessed, he recounts his past; his childhood, his schooling, the work of his profession, the influences that have made him who he is. In doing so, he shares with us his observations on the nature of life, love, art, illness, friendship, and many other things. Davies lets us have a picture of life, complete with accomplishments and disappointments, dreams and dreams undone, and makes it real and interesting and intelligent. I can understand the appeal he has for his fans and I will be reading more of Davies' books soon.	2001-06-04

Insight	Books	5	21	22	N	N	Mathematical puzzles for all ages	This book gave me a lot to think about when I was young, and of all the books with math and logic puzzles I enjoyed, this was one of the best.  Gardner has a way of turning problems into challenges, making the solving of them fun, and he also provides interesting explanations of problems with simplicity and clarity.  For children, this book is an opportunity to explore math as something other than repetitive calculations or irrelevant word problems from bad textbooks.  Adults too can use this book to hone their problem solving skills.  <br />The difficulty of aha! insights is the lack of technique in coming to such an insight.  It's a spontaneous reaction, something sudden and unexpected when you discover a simple solution.  These problems do not teach you how to have these insights, but allows for practice in order that they may become more frequent.  But the point is:  it's recreational math...  Enjoy it for the sake of enjoyment.	2001-05-31

The purpose of this book isn't really to teach you physics.  It is, after all, only six of numerous chapters in Feynman's \\"Lectures on Physics.\\"  What it does is to give the reader a taste of the scope of the field, what physicists do, and what the study of physics is like without going in too deep.  So, for the reader who does not really know about physics and has a slight interest in some basic concepts, this book is enjoyable and enlightening.<br />For the reader who has an extensive, or at least some, knowledge of physics already, I think this book would be even more fun to read.  You have little to learn in the way of the content of what he teaches, and so you can focus on how he teaches and think about the examples he gives.  It is by no means a waste of time unless you have read already the \\"Lectures on Physics.\\"  Feynman's lectures are much more exciting than any textbook, and reviewing basic materials from the perspective of someone like him is a worthwhile thing to do.	2001-05-26

But also like any other social issue, most people don't have much basis for their opinions other than beliefs and values steeped in misunderstanding.  Elliott Currie writes with the view that we must redefine our view of the criminal justice system, their purpose, and how our nation struggles with violence.  The design of it all, he argues, is out of whack.  Locking large numbers of people into cells and then releasing them without having addressed the underlying reasons why they got there in the first place is no solution.  Currie brings in much statistical data, which can make the first two chapters slow, but it is necessary.  You can't take social \\"science\\" seriously without such data.  He ends on a more philosophical note, but in between, he creates a well structured critique of America's crime situation.<br />First, he wonders about prisons.  Are we soft on crime?  Does prison work?  And do prisons pay back in prevented crimes what they cost?  Then he suggests that there are alternatives to incarceration alone, and discusses methods of prevention.  He also discusses crime as a social phenomenon, and economic factors that create favorable settings for crime.  And finally, he suggests that our view of the justice system itself must be revised, that decreasing violence should be a priority above punishment.<br />Having sat in on Elliott Currie's \\"Crime and Criminal Justice\\" class at UC Berkeley, I found myself wanting a little more from the book.  His class was more extensive and covered other issues like gun control, the death penalty, how to get and interpret data on crime, etc.  But this is not a textbook on crime.  It is Currie's plea that we all take responsibility for the lives of many who are young and live marginal existences, who suffer abuses and desperate conditions.  We provide them with the social service of incarceration and hope to be rid of their disagreeable behavior.  Is this what we really want?  Even if your views on crime are more conservative than Currie's, he provides an argument that is intellectual and passionate, and you may at least wonder if he has a point.	2001-05-25

Arlene's character is described more fully here, so we can understand their relationship better, and that was interesting.  But I was more drawn to the Challenger story, which consists of his difficulties in finding information on the causes of the explosion while having to deal with bureaucracy and the unscientific minds of management.  Sure, there must be tons of biases in here (he's a very opinionated guy), but Feynman's adventures are nonetheless filled with wonderful insights about life and science.  And the last chapter, \\"The Value of Science\\" deals with things that many have forgotten or have never learned about science, doubt, and integrity.	2001-05-24

I even found the writing tedious at first, though it became quite wonderful by the end.  It isn't a page turner for sure, but still I found myself slowly moving from bored to being very interested in the characters to being completely swallowed by the story and unaware of the world outside the novel.  <br />The book is about a couple, Port and Kit, and their friend Tunner.  They are travelling in the Sahara Desert,  far from their familiar culture.  Things happen to them which compose the story, but the novel is great because it captures the tension in the relationships between people.  Nobody seems to be able to understand the others, and each of the three characters are in some ways as foreign to each other as they are to their surroundings.  Eventually, Kit emerges as the main character, unable to comprehend her identity in a place that has stripped her of the sureness of her existence.  In a sense, she loses her post-War American psychological angst, and becomes immersed in the more basic anguish of fear and surrender.  Finishing the book is like waking from a bad dream.	2001-05-18

He knows what is at the heart of science. It isn't only about finding out significant things or making improvements on others' findings. Science and life should be fun. Learning and playing are not mutually exclusive, and Feynman found a playground in laboratories, bars, Japanese hotels, and topless clubs alike.

However, it is unapologetic in its political incorrectness (why wouldn't it be?).  The violence is graphic and women are given and taken as prizes.  And this is what is surprising and great about the Iliad.  It is raw, and it throws you into a Greek universe of battle, honor, and fate without self-conscious reservation.<br />There are reasons other than enjoyment to read this epic.  Along with the Odyssey, Homer's works are the most famous pieces of ancient literature.  They are often alluded to by other writings, and are also of historical significance.<br />Before you start the Iliad, you might want to read up on Greek mythology.  It isn't necessary, but it's probably much harder to relate to if you aren't very comfortable with the characteristics and stories of the Greek gods.  I cannot make comparisons among translations, but I found Fitzgerald's to be very readable and his words carry the tone and emotion of the story well.<br />The Iliad is not just about the Trojan war itself.  It is also about the individuals who must face each other in battle, their decisions, and their follies.  Most of all, it is the story of Akhilleus (Fitzgerald's spelling), and his choice between a heroic life cut short, or a long peaceful life without glory.  Of course everyone won't like it, especially if it's assigned for a class, but if you have an interest in the classics, you can't pass up the Iliad.	2001-05-14

Unless beating women and neglecting responsibilities are acts you consider virtuous, of course you will be appalled by what he does and thinks, and maybe by what his friends do and think as well.  If you are easily offended by crude language, insensitive drunks, and the satisfaction of carnal wants in written form, then save yourself some frustration.  Don't read the book.<br />But I never felt Sebastian was lacking in morality.  He is often clearly unable to act in a way that parallels his conscience.  He treats his women poorly and violently, but he cares for them in his simplistic, misguided way, and they do come back to him in spite of his flaws.  It is not expected that the world of fiction should reflect our idea of an ideal world.  And Donleavy doesn't satisfy that popular desire.<br />Instead what he does is to explore a man who is unrestricted (to an extreme) by the mores of the status quo.  He thrives on chaos and does not hesitate to create it (consciously or not).  He cannot help but gratify his immediate and basest needs, and so is motivated by sex and drink, and obsessed with fantasies of wealth, all the while neglecting relationships and his law studies.<br />I found the book quite funny, but humor is relative and depends on the interpretation of meanings.  Sebastian, like Melville's Bartleby, declines to accept what the world tries to make him do.  He avoids restraints like bills and rent, work and raising children.  But unlike Bartleby, he is full of life, violent and sexual, active and daring.  Sebastian's flaws may be inexcusable, but Donleavy lets us step out of a world that would ordinarily be horrified by such people, and shows us the possibilities of pure, delicious disorder.	2001-05-09

But it isn't a simple crime novel at all, with a couple who are mismatched except in their desire for each other and their willingness to kill, Freudian themes of the unconscious impulse, and the uncertainty of the truth of the narrator's words.

I found it to be very helpful in understanding what parts of the book exactly were found to be particularly offensive by Muslims, since my own knowledge of Islamic traditions and culture is lacking.  Since it is a compilation of many sources, it provides a wide array of opinions and perspectives that help to shed light on differing views of censorship, freedom, tolerance, and sacredness.	2001-05-06

This work of Salman Rushdie has inflamed many tempers, but what is this book really about?  It's not just about Islam, but faith and doubt in any religion...  Moreover, it is not that simple; there is no single continuous theme.  It is as multi-thematic as it is ambiguous and borderless.  Metamorphoses and grotesque transformations, the confusion of good and evil, religious fanaticism, multiculturalism, migration and displacement... all these ideas appear in the book in some form or other while the reader follows the adventures of Gibreel Farishta (the angel, but not) and Saladin Chamcha (the devil, but not) from their descent from an exploded plane to London, through their absurd, mythic misadventures, to their final reunion.  <br />Gibreel upon his landing from the fall finds himself slowly transformed into the Angel Gibreel, complete with halo.  Saladin, by contrast, grows horns, inherits bad breath, and a donkey-like lower body.  However it is unclear why these two are chosen the way they are since their roles do not parallel their personalities.  Gibreel is always rather selfish, and he hardly does much good, though usually gets away with anything.  Saladin is deliberate and insecure, trying to connect to a nation that is not natively his.  Gibreel has dreams of being the Archangel, engaging in the events of the Koran, yet these dreams seem to be a result of his diagnosed mental illness.  Saladin is beaten by the police, cuckolded, forced to stay in a room as a hideous monster and what has he done wrong?  And their stories go on for 547 splendid pages.<br />This is a truly ambitious work of fiction (with much historical basis, according to Rushdie).  As such, it is fantastically imaginative, and the prose is as musical as Nabokov's.  The fragmentation of events and lives, the disillusion with the sacred, the severing of one's past versus the search for personal history, and cultural distrust and misunderstanding reflect the 20th century (Western?) world with all its doubts and insecurities.  Morality is ambiguous, life is uncertain and the book keeps changing, escaping our desire to comprehend fully all its interweaving patterns.<br />The persecution of Rushdie, though unfortunate, is disturbingly fitting.  The resulting outcry to ban his book only serves to confirm the necessity of his words.  Those who are sensitive and fearful of blasphemy should perhaps leave this on the shelves.  But then again, its purpose is to emphasize the question which repeats itself several times in the book:  What kind of idea is this?  If answers do not precede questions, then can belief exist without doubt? Maybe the questions too are sacred, and the censorship of them is a sin.	2001-05-06

Epic in scope, it follows the rise and fall of the Ambersons as the spoiled and arrogant George Minafer grows up.  I enjoyed the somewhat melodramatic story and found many parallels between these times and the world of today.  The plot is emotional and powerful, and it is easy to see why Orson Welles would have wanted so much to make it a film.<br />What makes the book especially interesting, however, is Booth Tarkington's ability to understand and describe the changes going through America at the time.  The setting is more than just a \\"character;\\" it dictates the circumstances of its inhabitants.  It provides the foundation for the way of life they must live.  This is not only a tale of George and his family falling from great heights, but also a record of how a small town grew into a city, how automobiles changed the landscape in which we live, how people were forced to adapt to this unsympathetic setting between the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  He writes mainly from George's point of view, so there is a romantic, nostalgic vision of how things once were, but Tarkington is not fooled into believing that technological and social change has not made some things better, just as he isn't fooled into thinking they haven't made some things worse.  What the Ambersons saw as tragedy and loss, others saw as opportunity.  I percieved no moral lesson or message; this book is about the tragedy and loss of a proud clan unable to comprehend that in an industrial age, life was no longer static.<br />(There is also a good lesson in here on the risks of not diversifying your investments!)	2001-04-24

This book is for those people who feel as though they don't have control over their money and financial goals, and don't know where to turn to in order to get that control.  There are many other books out there, mainly motivational, that prey on such readers, but they hardly give any practical or useful advice.  Rather, they tell you what you already know intuitively, and make you think that you're hearing it for the first time.  You don't gain any more understanding, and you don't change your bad habits.<br />Eric Tyson helps you to learn about ways to save, invest, and buy insurance.  He doesn't fluff up the book with lame, tangential stories.  He doesn't try to sound profound when speaking simple truths.  He sounds more like a teacher who is just trying to explain the basics of sound financial behavior.  If you know a lot about personal finance, there may not be much that is new here; it's a \\"dummies\\" book after all.  But all the advice is well grounded and he explains it well.  Of course, some people will disagree with some things.  Perhaps you don't want to invest in mutual funds (which he enthusiastically recommends) and would rather play the market by researching individual companies on their own or day trading according to message board tips.  But to advise that would be ridiculous.  For all the time and hassle involved, the average person may not realize any returns doing that.  For the average person, mutual funds are a very good way of earning healthy returns in the long run, without much effort.<br />I found his chapters on retirement accounts and insurance to be most helpful, but only because I didn't know much about the topics.  He doesn't get too in-depth, understandably, but he covers the topics with enough detail to enlighten a financial dummy into acting wisely.  I highly recommend this book to those who want to learn safe and conservative ways to handle their money and want to gain a clear understanding of how to evaluate their own financial health.  It's a good place to start, but don't stop your financial education here.  Keep reading!  And even if you do think you know everything, skimming through this at the library might still be useful.<br />I'm reviewing the 2nd edition, by the way.

He has an eye for what pleases himself aesthetically, and he can perceive details of objects and spaces that most people would perhaps never notice consciously. His ruminations on architecture, food, and the role of the elderly in society are especially interesting and his defense of Japanese culture and art here is well presented.<br />However, his admiration for things Japanese sometimes feels disturbingly like mere nationalism. &quot;Westerners&quot; are the propagators of ugliness and the once beautiful Japanese sensibility has been tarnished with their bad sense of aesthetic. His comments on race cross into the realm of strangeness, and many of his arguments are based on taste. This may be fine. We should not expect Tanizaki to be concerned with political correctness (nor would we want him to be). We cannot expect him to deny his personal tastes either. But though I sympathize with his nostalgia, he sounds only like an old man who cannot relate to the significant changes that have coursed through all the modern world. He would rather crouch into a corner called Japan instead of embracing what good may come, even if the result is uncertainty and imperfection.<br />It is true that shadows are undervalued. In all the arts, film in particular, it is the spectacle, the action, the excitement that behold the viewer, and we neglect the subtle, the dark, and the empty. There are spaces in between, voids and silences, that are far more important and Tanizaki wants to emphasize this point.<br />But there must be better ways to argue this. Japanese art and culture are still very much alive. And even &quot;westerners&quot; can learn to appreciate that.	2001-04-15

It is a popular idea that the super-busy lifestyles of Americans are taking a toll on our happiness and health.  With great technologies like cell phones and the internet, we have more opportunities than ever to spend more time doing work while spending less time with family, friends, hobbies, civic duties, and intellectual pursuits.  <br />So how has this affected our sleep?  And should we care?  I'm not so sure about his claim that &quot;sleep is the most important predictor of how long you will live, perhaps more important than whether you smoke, exercise, or have high blood pressure or cholesterol levels,&quot; but still, it is a compelling claim and a disturbing one.  Mainstream health knowledge usually does not address adequate sleep, and many are willing to sacrifice a lot of sleep for work or school.  <br />A lot of this book is filled with personal anecdotes and sometimes it takes a while to get to the meaty factual material.  It could probably be much shorter if Dr. Dement wasn't so passionate about getting his message to the public.  It does have information about what sleep is, sleep disorders, the functions of sleep, and it includes a quasi-self-help section on how to start sleeping better, and these are indeed useful.  But I felt that the main purpose of this book was as a manifesto, a wake-up call to people who neglect the importance of sleep and a call for people to take control of the public health issue of excessive sleep debt, which can impair perception and judgment and result in fatal consequences.  Much of the book is devoted to the message:  Don't drive while sleepy.<br />Unless you're looking for hardcore scientific information about sleep, this book is quite adequate in being informative. I would have preferred something more straightforward.  Hopefully for me, there exists another more concise, more direct, and less layperson-oriented book on sleep.  But for those who don't mind the meandering narrative, Dr. Dement provides a good general overview on the topic of sleep, why we need it, and why we should care.	2001-04-07

Anatole Broyard writes about New York in 1947 from his perspective, as a World War II veteran coming home to new ideas and strange people.  His vision is romantic and nostalgic, but he also recognizes the limitations of these times and his own feeling of being an outsider among outsiders.  Being so immersed in the intellectual and sexual experiences of life, he longs for a more personal, emotional bond which he fails to find.  Though Broyard could not finish the book before his death, it is still very much a worthwhile read if you love books, sex, and the excitement of cities.	2001-04-02

Not surprising.  He's a former Secretary of Labor under Clinton's administration.  He begins by telling us that corporations have lost their national identity.  In other words, almost all American and foreign corporations consist of employees, investors, and machinery that are located all over the world, and so the traditional view that American economic progress being directly related to the profitability of American firms is no longer valid.  So what then should be the economic goals of the state?<br />Three types of workers exist in Reich's thinking:  routine producers, in-person servers, and symbolic analysts.  Reich shows evidence that the symbolic analysts, who &quot;solve, identify, and broker problems by manipulating symbols,&quot; are the winners in this age.  The workers who are educated and can use their knowledge to supply a service will get the highest incomes.  Those who have no knowledge to sell, who are engaged in routine jobs in factories or in-person servers such as waiters and cashiers will be left behind them.  <br />So Reich proposes that education is of great importance, and devotes two chapters to &quot;The Education of the Symbolic Analyst.&quot;  It doesn't matter whether or not American firms, if definable, prosper.  It is in the long term interests of the American people for the people to learn and be able to use that knowledge.  If foreign firms come and employ Americans, good.  The workers will still be Americans, and they will learn stuff in the process.  <br />But not all Americans can be symbolic analysts, and perhaps not all symbolic analysts can be well off.  Reich's main concern seems to be income inequality and the social attitudes of the symbolic analysts.  He feels that we have lost a sense of national community as more and more symbolic analysts, who earn the most income, become less dependent upon the other workers who earn much less.  If those who are fortunate do not feel obligated to those who are not, then what does that mean for America as a whole?<br />I don't feel that I gained much new information in reading this work.  And though I read with interest, the economic arguments are not clearly stated (understandably, as this is written for the public).  So, many claims were made and they make sense given the data and reasoning he provides, but it isn't a sturdy enough work for me to give more than three stars.  Robert Reich takes a liberal view, but I disagree with other reviews that this book is drivel.  One review comments on how the rich deserve to be rich for working hard and the poor, it is implied, are lazy and deserve to be somehow punished by low wages.  Income disparity is a concern.  Whether or not Reich's argument is sound and his data accurate, there is nothing wrong in sympathizing with the poor or thinking that government might serve some purpose in aiding them.  There is much that is wrong in making general assumptions about the behavior of the poor and what they deserve.  Another review says that Reich advocates strategic trade in which &quot;we ought to use tariffs and subsidies to increase American firms' market shares in their fields.&quot;  Reich does advocate subsidies to help the work force gain advanced skills, but he says, &quot;it would draw no distinctions based on the nationalities of the firm's shareholders or top executives.&quot;  Such subsidies would have little to do with &quot;American firms,&quot; a notion he spends the first half of the book trying to erase.  <br />Not great, not bad.  Pick it up if you're interested in these topics.	2001-03-26

It is mostly a collection of simple rules and their explanations, all of which are easy to grasp and to employ in one's writing.  As in George Orwell's essay &quot;Politics and the English Language,&quot; the central theme here is to be clear.  Be precise and don't confuse the reader.<br />The table of contents list the rules, so once you've read the book, you can just flip to the contents to remind yourself of them.  If you want to improve your writing, there are many books on the topic, but here is where to start.  If you disagree with the rules as some Amazon reviewers do, fine.  The authors are dead, and I'm sure they won't take it too personally if you criticize their work.  But I don't find the rules restrictive.  To the contrary, unless you really know the language and are adept at using it, you can't break these rules without making a terrible blunder.  Anybody who writes will benefit from spending an hour or so skimming through this book once every few years.	2001-03-25

The other reviews have already noted these things:  the catchy terminology (Microchip Immune Deficiency, the Electronic Herd, The Golden Arches Theory... etc.), his op-ed writing style, his over-confidence and ego, and the simplicity of his arguments.  Except for the last one, these are surface criticisms, but they affected my enjoyment of the book.<br />On the other hand, the material in the book is interesting enough.  He discusses how the system of globalization developed from the fall of the Berlin Wall and the opening of economies.  His experience in journalism is an asset he uses in recalling conversations with economists, politicial leaders, and civilians and thus personalizing the effects of this new world order.  He describes the advantanges that globalism brings to all people, in developed and undeveloped countries, but is fully aware of the dangers of letting a system so powerful go uncontrolled.  His basic theme is that everyone must eventually bow down to globalism because it is inevitable, but everyone must also be conscious that it can remove and dislocate people from their pasts, which can have unstable results.  <br />I gave this book three stars because somehow, I just wasn't very satisfied.  Though it covered a lot of ground and I did find it insightful in many places, especially Friedman's analysis of the Cold War system versus the post-Cold War system, the op-ed style of writing and the too many parables and metaphors made the reading a little laborious.  However, if you only have a vague idea about what globalism is, and you want a better understanding of how this system affects you and everyone else in the world, then by all means, I recommend it. I do think Friedman gets the job done, but I would have liked a little more depth and substance behind his arguments.	2001-03-23

He devotes sections to the four seasons, in which he tells how the fog is formed, where storms come from, and why there is so much variation within Bay Area microclimates.  He also has a chapter on clouds, and a concluding chapter on climate change.  I never knew much about weather (besides what I understood from forecasts on TV: sunny, partly cloudy, rain, etc.), but now I appreciate more the unique climates of the SF Bay region.	2001-03-23

The powers that he mentions (in Part 3 of the book) are those of advanced weaponry, writing systems that made communication more efficient, immunity to disease, and complex political organization.  What makes this book so interesting, though, is his discussion of the role of agriculture, animal domestication, and geographic location in creating a setting that favored or hindered the development and proliferation of &quot;guns, germs, and steel.&quot;  The first part of the book introduces the reader to this idea, but it is he second part of the book, &quot;The Rise and Spread of Food Production,&quot; that explains it and thus encompasses most of the premise upon which the book builds.  <br />The fourth part of the book is a series of quick case studies where Diamond shows his thesis in action.  It is not without value since it is empirical evidence for his theory, but it becomes a little repetitive and the joy of discovering new knowledge fades.  And I agree with others who thought Diamond's political correctness a little distracting.  Nonetheless, it is enlightening and fun to read and what more can one ask for than that?	2001-03-16

It is a very personal portrait, and a (intellectually) passionate call for people to broaden their scope of knowledge and to put their ideas into action, to question what we shouldn't easily accept and to defend marginal groups that lack political power.  If you think highly of the French intellectuals like Sartre and Camus, or any other modern thinkers, you may want to read this very short book.	2001-03-16

The biggest impediment to the acceptance of veganism is the stereotype that exists concerning the taste of vegetarian cuisine.  The Millennium Cookbook offers some of the best tasting, best looking recipes that I have ever had, vegan or not.  The range of flavors and ingredients used are creative and delicious, and provide a lot of inspiration for trying out varieties of foods that you may never have used before.  They end up looking great no matter what, so though some recipes take some time, they will be well worth it if you have company you want to impress. There are variations and tips on sauces and dressings if you want to make the same thing in a different way.  And there is nutritional information contained for each recipe on calories, fats, proteins, carbohydrates, sodium and fiber for those who are concerned.  There is cholesterol information too, although everything has 0 cholesterol anyway.  If you like the stuff in this cookbook, you'll probably want to visit the restaurant in San Francisco as well, which is another great experience in itself. <br />And everything is fun to make, at least for me. You'll have to buy it to find out if it's fun for you too.  And yes, some recipes take time and more than a few ingredients.  But this book shows that there are no sacrifices a vegan has to make with regards to taste.  Delicious and healthful vegan cuisine can and does exist.  Breaking down the taste stereotype is as important as vegan ethics and health in gaining mainstream acceptance of veganism.	2001-03-16
