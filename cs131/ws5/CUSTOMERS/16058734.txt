To what extent is the lawyer-client privilege protected? Phillip Margolin tackles this and more in the very readable legal thriller The Last Innocent Man.  After wrenching a client, accused of murder, from the jaws of justice, David Nash, lawyer extraordinaire, christened \\"The Ice Man\\", has about had enough.  He feels no pleasure in his victory, having grown tired of defending guilty men. Nash is looking for an innocent man.  However when Nash defends a fellow lawyer Larry Stafford for murder, he realizes he has gotten more than he bargained. For not only is he sleeping with his client's wife, he discovers they both could be lying to him.  Realizing what is at stake, The Ice Man mounts a robust defence for Stafford. Will it be enough? You'll have to read the book to find the fate of the Last Innocent Man.  Margolin, a criminal defense attorney at Portland, writes decently well. His tackling of the ethical implication of defending the guilty, or of inappropriate relations with a client's spouse provide for juicy thinking.  Gault comes across as an impressive street version of Hannibal Lecter; Nash, as seriously conflicted. The court scenes though not exceptional are nonetheless formidable. Imagine the drama of the Mercedes Benz testimony in a real courtroom.  Yet as with most books from this genre, there is stuff that stretches the imagination. I have known sex to be a legendary prop for authors, but having sex with a lady the first hour you meet her is taking it a tad too far.  The courtroom scenes with his ex lacked flying sparks, while Conklin's murder merited greater attention. The book ended nicely, though I would have expected a greater punch.    Still The Innocent Man is worth a read, meriting the attention you would give to a Grisham.	2005-10-03

Following the 2000 and 2004 election fiascos, it has become increasingly pertinent to debate the utility of money, especially those from special-interest groups, in our election process. <br />In Money and Politics, David Donnelly, Janice Fine and Ellen S. Miller collaborate to explain how reform can make elections more democratic. Donnelly, Director of the Reform Voter Project, Fine, Senior Fellow at the Center for Community Change, and Miller, publisher of Tompaine.com, describe the insidious nature of today's politics where politicians auction themselves to the highest bidder; they also express their support for public financing of elections as a panacea. <br />There is much to enjoy and like about this book. As a pamphlet of about 100 pages, it is unencumbered with political jargon, instead relying on the simplicity of language to serve its purpose. Seeking to educate, attempting to proffer the best solution to this rampant corruption, the writers allow differing viewpoints from varied contributors including Senator Russell Feingold and Thomas E. Mann. This makes it campaign reform a la carte.  <br /> <br />Nevertheless I harbor doubts about the efficacy of their reform. For example when they say, \\"though Americans accept the legitimacy of economic inequality, they do not generally accept that the rich are entitled to greater political representation,\\" they attempt to deny the obvious: The Founding Fathers never believed in the political equality between the common man and the aristocrat. How else can you explain property owners being the only ones initially allowed to vote? <br />Even as I agree with Phelps that \\"rich people have an unfair advantage over the rest of us,\\" I disagree that this is inimical to the system. Since the rich have more to lose, what is wrong with their having a greater stake in the political process? <br />There is also the legitimate concern of voters wondering why their tax dollars are used to fund candidates they dislike. In a countryfounded on freedom and choice, is it not detestable that candidates could be financially supported by people who would never vote for them. Moreover this book was written before the revolutionary effects of 527's and Internet campaigning were seen. These new phenomena appear to be leveling the political playing field. These developments are not addressed here, so interested readers will have to look elsewhere. <br /> <br />Like Ackerman, I have to ask: \\"Do we really want equality at the cost of shutting down debate?\\". I believe not. Seeking clean politics is expecting what has never been and what will never be. <br />Still whether you support campaign-finance reform or not, as an introduction to this essential subject, one cannot do much better than Money and Politics.	2005-09-26

Watson describes the events which led to his discovery, with Francis Crick, Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin, of the double helix structure. <br />Major scientific advances are not made in isolation, so we get critical vignettes of titans like Linus Pauling, Lawrence Bragg, as well as his co-workers. We are treated to an unembellished account of missteps, false starts, and overblown egos. This straight-to-the-heart book emotes the milieu of the UK educational system in the 60s. <br /> <br />In plain language with a smattering of technical jargon, we are shown how this mystery was solved not with the arcane tools of the trade, but rather with the age-old faculty called commonsense. <br /> <br />Very few science books captivate one's attention like Watson's. Beyond being a tell-most of the race to unravel the DNA structure, the Double Helix shows us how far we can go when, determined, we swim against the tide of conventional wisdom.	2005-09-26

The late nineteenth and early twentienth century were a fecund period for classical mystery writers. Among the most popular was Baroness Emmuska Orczy. <br />Baroness Orczy, a Hungarian aristocrat, was best known for writing the Scarlet Pimpernel. In this collection we are introduced to a memorable character known as the Old Man. <br />I must confess that some of the stories could be a tad too easy. This is not the fault of the author. Over the years a lot of copycats have imitated her plots, so reading them now, they may not seem as original or as challenging. <br />Yet there is still much to appreciate in these short stories. The format is unique, with the cast at the beginning usually made up of the Old Man, the lady journalist, and the victims and perpetrators of the crime. <br />No one has yet mentioned ordinary and mystery in the same sentence;  and this one is no exception. We get the  eccentric Old Man knotting his string, intimidating the lady with his analytical abilities,  his dislike for the police and his empathy for the criminals. <br />The baroness revels in disguises, eavesdropping, and mistaken witnesses---the stock-in-trade of a mystery writer. She establishes that simplicity and impossibility are synonymous, the apparent difference due to sagacity.  <br />The phrase 'The Old Man in the Corner' is a misnomer since the man takes the front seat at all trials, and does not hang in the corner except when explaining mysteries. The facts are not given to him by the journalist, though in deference to him, I admit he does no investigating of his own. <br />Being in one place constrains the stories. They lack real drama, and are not as suspenseful as Christie or as elaborate as Doyle. <br /> <br />However it takes nothing away from her pioneering effort in the mystery/detective field. If you have surfeited on Holmes and Poirot, you may try these twelve mysteries about the man spinning tales in the corner.	2005-09-26

Howard's \\"The Death of Common Sense\\". <br />This short book details how America has deviated from being a bastion of freedom to being a nation subjugated by laws. <br />Mr. Howard presents a wonderful case against government-induced regulation---laws so far removed from reality, so unworkable in practice and so disastrous for productivity.  <br />It would not be difficult countering some of his arguments, however I would deem it unlikely to rebut his central thesis which is that until Americans retain responsibility for their decisions instead of looking to arcane rulebooks, we should not expect the buck to stop anywhere. <br />Hence the reason this book is more important now. As we look at the Sarbanes-Oakley act, a reaction to the Enron scandal, and the McCain-Feingold bill for campaign finance reform, we have to ask ourselves if the pill is not worse than the pain. Inherent in finely written law is the ability to subvert them, as was seen during the 2004 elections. Why should we citizens take the risk? <br />The chapter \\"A Nation of Enemies\\" was illuminating. Quoting Isaiah Berlin, \\"Liberty for the wolves is death for the lambs,\\" he advances the claim, which some deem legimitate, that enumerated rights can be antithetical to each other. Others definitely would argue to the contrary. <br />Therein lies its beauty: the ability to teach without hectoring, to dispute without hurling invectives.  <br />Read this highly educative book and discover why \\"Relying on ourselves is...commonsense.\\"	2005-09-20

Joseph Ellis, thankfully, does not fall into either extremes. <br /> <br />No one in the history of the nation deserves more praise and respect than George Washington. Respected, even feared, by his peers, he was clearly recognized as the foremost Founding Father. Every kid remembers him as the commander of the revolutionary forces, as the first president, as the man who freed his slaves upon death. In this book,  Ellis is more concerned with investigating how Washington became what he was. <br />His Excellency, George Washington, starts with his life as a youth under the british forces. A couple of sentences suffice regarding his birth and his family. Proceeding from there, we get to view his marriage, then his entry into the war and the politics of the colonies. Finally we are shown his presidency, and his private life, after resignation. <br />Ellis writes a midsize biography that manages to skirt over most details of his subject. The writing is scholarly, with sufficient facts and suppositions. Since Washington was a man of his time, we are provided with a snapshot of the colonial clime---the riotous period before the war of independence; we also get to see him as a general, then as president. <br />We see some snippets of his life: how his lack of formal education made him inferior; how his decision to free slaves was on economic, rather than moral grounds. <br />I was struck by a passage on page 88, \\"Though Washington never wavered---in the end, steadfastness was his most valuable attribute, along with the stamina that accompanied it---popular enthusiasm for the war faded alongside the illusion that it would be a brief affair.\\" (A lesson to the current president: you are not alone.) <br />However, His Excellency manages to fall short. Some of it cannot be blamed on the author because in all honesty, he is writing the biography of a mute. Washington's reticence makes it difficult to divine his thoughts <br />Nevertheless, it was foolhardy attempting to tell so important a life in less than 300 pages. For instance, the incident involving Citizen Genet took about three paragraphs even with its importance. Indeed most situations are brushed aside in this quick read. Furthermore, the brief glimpses at other revolutionaries like Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison, etc do not do justice to the input they provided to sustain Washington's image. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, whatever his foibles, Washington must be praised for holding the nation together in its infancy.  <br />His Excellency is a excellent truncated account of the life of the man and a nation: General George Washington and the United States of America.	2005-09-10

He focusses on the first three presidents: Washington, Adams, and Jefferson; he, however, gives supporting roles to Hamilton, Madison, and Monroe. Vidal does not move chronologically, instead he jumps through events, granting him freedom to pursue his prose style.  He covers all the major incidents in the life of the young nation. Filled with lots of history and biographies, enlivened with acerbic commentary, one learns from this book.    In Inventing a Nation, Vidal challenges us to confront some of the unpleasant parts of our past. He infers rightly that the Founding Fathers, after the Revolution, became the very evil they were fighting against; however he concludes wrongly that this resulted in a contradiction. I beg to differ. The Nation magazine, which I believe prides itself on supporting freedom of speech, in a recent edition chastised fastfood companies for dishonest advertising. To them it is no contradiction. I do not fault them, neither do I fault the founders.  There are other remarks I oppose in this book. Like in page 136, he claims that the Electoral College thwarts the majority rule, and is therefore undemocratic. This is true, yet it is not right. Because it is possible for the majority not to represent the nation. I would rather prefer the Electoral College than Tocqueville's 'tyranny of the majority.'     What must be appreciated is that the experiment the founders indulged in was debated on intellectual, even ideological, grounds.  Inventing a Nation exposes the depth of banality in politics today. Regardless of its sweeping generalizations, it succeeds because it forces the reader think. Anything less, the author should have saved the trees.	2005-09-10

Enter The Devil's Alternative. <br />It is the 80's before glasnost, before perestroika, when Ukraine is in subjugation. Andrew Drake is plotting an act to bring down the russian occupiers. A power struggle in the Kremlin; an american president uncertain of his place in history; a british agent brooding over his lost love; a supertanker undertaking its maiden voyage. Under Forsyth, all disparate events are seamlessly linked. <br />The Day of the Jackal introduced Frederick Forsyth to the world; the Devil's Alternative introduced the world to its itself. Frederick Forsyth, a former BBC correspondent in Europe and Africa, produced an exceptional work which is brilliant, and even now contemporary. Just substitute US for Russia, and Islamic fighters for the Ukrainians, and you have a war plucked out of today's headlines. <br />His writing is taut, detailed, with crisp dialogue. Certain portions of the book were seared in my memory even after I first read them about a decade ago. The description of the president's office, the telescopic night vision, the condor satellites, leave you with no doubt you are in the hands of a master storyteller. Forsyth's expansive knowledge of world politics, and his characterization make this an uneasy book. Is Drake to be loved or reviled? Was the policy to sacrifice two persons for disarmanent or negotiate food for arms, to be applauded or deplored?  <br />This book is the exemplar of a political thriller with nonstop action. Excluding the obvious nailbiting and insomnia, Frederick Forsyth fashions a riveting delight. By the end you will left wondering, between Munro and Rudin, who did choose the Devil's Alternative.	2005-09-03

For decades, high school and college students were fed a biased rendition of American History. Thomas Woods, history graduate from Harvard, has released this book to serve as a counterpoise.<br /><br />The Politically Incorrect Guide is a revealing read. It focuses on those aspects of American History best known to its casual students. Woods starts with the colonial origins of American Liberty, proceeding to the Constitution. Continuing on the Civil War, the World Wars and the Depression, he thereafter gives a cursory glance at the JFK, LBJ, administrations, before finishing off the last century, and the book, with the Clinton era.<br /><br />This guide is written in textbook format; even the arguments given could easily be understood by a tenth grade student. Wood shatters established myths while managing to elevate some arcane topics and persons to relevance. In this regard I enjoyed his exposition on the oft unmentioned Nullification, Dred Scott, the McCarthy hearings, and nonpersons Walter Duranty, Michael Milken. He also exposes the nexus between history and economics, as well as the winner's predilection with rewriting history.<br /><br />Still this book is hardly a model of scholastic perfection.<br /><br />Woods takes some glib, even facile, explanations as alternatives to what we have been taught. An instance is when he claims \\"slave states would have had more power in the federal government,\\" if blacks had been counted as five fifths of a free man. In a real democracy, power among states is never equal, and should never be. Therefore whether blacks were believed to be five fifths or three fifths of a white is irrevelant; it was an immoral law which was not made right simply because it was approved by our Founding Fathers. (Imagine counting the exploding hispanic population in California as a fraction to curb its national influence.) This treatment of the period after independence as political Utopia suffuses his book. While unabashedly supporting the second amendment, he fails to define what the founders meant by \\"arms.\\" If James Madison resurrected today, would he believe the citizens right to own bazookas and Apache helicopters is enshrined in the constitution.<br /><br />His us-against-them (Libertarian vs. Progressive vs. Conservative) mentality does not permit him at times to see nuances, hence when he chides Lincoln as a racist on the basis of a debate with Stephen Douglas, he neglects stating that slavery was ingrained in the societal fabric, making it difficult for one to declare what he truly believed. I neither blame Lincoln nor Douglas, and would expect likewise from the author.<br /><br />Regardless of its inherent flaws, this book is based on excellent scholarship, aiming less to educate than to challenge. The Politically Incorrect Guide should be read as a reference rather than a stand-alone. It is more useful for asking questions than seeking answers.s to define what the founders meant by \\"arms.\\" If James Madison resurrected today, would he believe the citizens right to own bazookas and Apache helicopters is enshrined in the constitution. <br />His us-against-them (Libertarian vs. Progressive vs. Conservative) mentality does not permit him at times to see nuances, hence when he chides Lincoln as a racist on the basis of a debate with Stephen Douglas, he neglects stating that slavery was ingrained in the societal fabric, making it difficult for one to declare what he truly believed.

That policy is under review due to The Andromeda Strain.  A mission has been assigned to a team of four scientists: Analyze the contents of a returned space capsule and determine why almost all the inhabitants of the immediate vicinity are dead. Mission can only be accomplished if the team survives.  Jeremy Stone, a lawyer-turned-bacteriologist; Peter Leavitt, a parasitologist; Mark Hall, a surgeon; and Charles Burton, a pathologist were the members of this team. Starting from the elemental, combining intellects and egos, defying bungled analysis, and omnipresent danger, will this group succeed, or will they doom the earth to its worst nightmare?  If by any chance Crichton has to leave his day job---a guess, since he could be a night-writer---I predict he would have no difficulty getting employed as a lecturer. His familiarity with science is evident in the writing. The Andromeda Strain abounds with illustrations and pedagogical aids that simplify some complex scientific principles.  What I found most refreshing was Leavitt's addressing the meaning of life. What defines life? Indeed a scientific question, although more importantly, a philosophical one, it demonstrates the limits of science in the face of man's transcience.  The plot is taut, the writing tight, a la New York Times investigative scoop mode. This is the nearest thing to a movie I have read.  Please Be Warned: The Andromeda Strain is infectious, and currently, there is no effective innoculation.	2005-08-26

A Case of the Shorts begins with the assassination of John Dempster, CEO of Dempster-Torrey. Haldering and Co. is retained, and Timothy is drafted to investigate why the company is a target for industrial sabotage. In the last novella, One From Column A, Chin Tung Lee, of the White Lotus label, assigns the investigative team to discover why anyone would speculate in such a conservative company. Oedipal lust to unbridled greed actuated by hatred are just a little of what we see in The Game. <br />As usual, Timothy Cone cracks the cases with confidence and exaggerated bravado, leveraging on the knowledge of financial specialists, and his bevy of police informants. The whole cast from the Files are back, with some chaps added to compensate for the diversity of the new clientele.  <br />Most Sanders fans when reading about this shabby detective are apt to compare him unfavorably to the dapper McNally. They might just be mistaken. Actually, both characters do have their similarities: their snitches in the police department who believe in quid pro quo, their emphasis on appearances and location, as well as their queer relationships, and controlled humor. <br />Yet Cone has his strengths. Here,the bad guys are unafraid to get their hands dirty; also, as each client is referred to Haldering and Co., there is a certain a continuity along stories. Moreover, since the focus is on financial institutions, a virgin forest in investigative fiction, we get to read a lot about the unheralded SEC. <br />In Timothy's Game, Lawrence Sanders delivers sizzling stuff that should be enjoyed in it's own right.	2005-08-22

He eschewed his hardboiled crime fiction in novels like the Third Deadly Sin for the Timothy Series, finally ending with the feel good McNally. <br />The Timothy Files presents the likable Timothy Cone as a corporate intelligence specialist (he hates the term \\"private detective\\"), who works for Haldering and Co. Haldering and Co. investigates potential suitors for mergers and takeovers. This benign milieu provides the backdrops for some intriguing mysteries. <br />The Wall Street Dick, first of the three novellas in this book, opens with the death of Ed Griffon, a fellow investigator. Timothy attempts to find his killer, while taking over his unfinished work. The second, the Whirligig Action, focuses on Nu Hope, a fertility clinic, which is being scouted by an an aspiring investor. A Covey of Cousins, the third and final novella, pits Timothy's horsesense against a dysfunctional clan of criminals, the Laboris. Drug smuggling, money laundering are just the least of the challenges he encounters on his way to unraveling these riddles. <br />With a superb cast of the bumbling Timothy, the overbearing Samantha, and the hideous and adorable Cleo, we are set for a thrill ride. Their relationship, as well as his exploits, satisfy an innate desire to see the underdog win. The writing is light-hearted, even when the crimes are not. Indeed, in Sanders world, light humor and dark crimes happily coexist. <br />A good way to pass time, all readers should enjoy this flavor of Cone.	2005-08-20

After all, who has not had an uncle Ernie who drops to the house unannounced, or a friend, Jimmy who pesters you to double date with him every weekend? <br />As you consider your mortality and your declining privacy, as you ponder how to enjoy these transient pleasures, you might just be tempted to apply the untried and untested principles of this exotic burlesque: How to Lose Friends and Alienate People.	2005-08-10

That is until he is summoned on a mission he cannot refuse: He has been employed to extricate Peter Novak from captivity by a terrorist group. <br />He goes on this mission because some years ago, Novak, a billionaire philanthropist, eerily dissimilar to Bill Gates, had negotiated his release as a hostage. His nightmare starts when Novak is killed after he has successfully aided in his escape. Worse still Janson has now been branded as a traitor. The next 500 pages are spent showing us how he attempts to untangle the web he has found himself in. <br />The book is action soaked with the blood of a thousand men felled by the unflinching marksmanship and sangfroid of Janson; violence and betrayal seem the stock-in-trade of these players of hide and seek. <br />I must admit in the previous decade I found Robert Ludlum one of the better masters of intrigue; now that knowledge has been tempered with the realization that Ludlum never outgrew the characters which made his novels popular. <br />Indeed this novel seems a collection of some of his earlier works. We have the man-who-is-not-what-he-claims-to-be, culled from the Sigma Protocol and the Bourne Identity; the puppet master who ostensibly controls global affairs from behind the stage, as in the Matarese Circle. <br />Moreoever, when Janson starts dodging bullets (or would it be bullets dodging him?) with increasing frequency I encountered the cloying feeling which comes with over-indulgence. I must have read it somewhere!  <br />In this thriller, rabid fans will be too blind to admit his flaws, expectant newcomers will be too enamored of his legend, while disinterested readers will admit that the Janson Directive displays that Ludlum is not as great as claimed to be.	2005-08-08

Ron Chernow's biography rescues him from this abyss. Most Americans from high school either remember him as one of the authors of the Federalist papers (which they have not read) or as the patriot who was felled in a duel by Aaron Burr. This hardly scratches the surface of the man I consider the greatest after Franklin. <br />Hamilton was born in the Caribbean, suffered hardships from his illegimate birth, and by good fortune was, sponsored to the colonies---there was no US at the time. By the awesome power of his intellect and the powerful strokes of his pen, he rose to become George Washington's secretary during the revolutionary wars. <br />Hamilton then went on to become Secretary of Treasury. Following Washington's retirement, he became the lightning rod for some of the most partisan wrangling ever witnessed on the continent. And as we all know he died at the hand of his nemesis, the vice president Burr. <br />Chernow explains what we know, and exposes what we do not, of this monumental figure. Sifting through massive documents, he produces a work that should be a delight to any lover of biographies. Here we catch a glimpse of a flawed, tragic man, endowed with supernatural wit which could only be dreamed.  <br />Understanding and appreciating America's independence from England is impossible without a study into Hamilton's life, because he was the actuator, or least an observer, of almost every major event that took place in the country's infancy. If we accept that Madison was the pen behind the constitution, then Hamilton should be credited with being its brain. His lucid, terribly incisive arguments in the Federalist papers still exist today in concepts like judicial review, taxation, etc. <br />Ron Chernow does a good job of integrating the man into his time.  There are wonderful descriptions of his friends--Robert Troup, Rufus King, Phillip Schyler, Governeur Morris--as well as his foes--John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, George Clinton, etc. What I find surprising is that for all his eminence he hardly ever met Benjamin Franklin.  <br />The writing is fluid, jumping from one event to another, at a steady pace. For a book of close of 750 pages, it is amazingly engaging. Chernow plays the reader like a harp on the final pages leading to the duel. The emotion is dished out in bits, making us hunger for more. <br />Through out, we are exposed to his impatience, his malevolence, and his hypocrisy. The prima facie case behind his being self-made is shattered, because for all his knowledge, Hamilton could not have risen without patronage, especially that of his in-laws, and George Washington. <br /> <br />There is much to learn from his life, and from this book, and I can ill advice anyone to read it.

(Adventures of a Curious Character)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	extraordinary feynman	For those of us who ditched studying the sciences for arts, it is obvious we suffered from malnutrition: we needed a dose of feynman. <br />Richard Feynman was born in New York, where he harnessed his skills as a radio mechanic during the Depression.  He studied Theoritical Physics at MIT, then Princeton, before moving to Cornell as a visiting lecturer. Interspersed within this period was a stint at Los Alamos in the Manhattan Project where he rubbed shoulders with the creme de la creme of the scientific community. <br />Now, there are a lot of scientists who have excelled better in their fields; there might even be some who even had rather interesting lives. What separates Feynman's reminisces from those of his peers is his jollity. Infact his book is infected with it. <br />Between globetrotting to foreign universities for lectures, and hobnobbing with intellectual brahmins, he found time to learn the bungo drums, paint naked models, among other escapades. <br />Surely you are joking, is not a timeline detailing his progress from birth to death, rather it is a fascinating pastiche of tales from his varied life. <br />His cracking of safes was a real treat for me, as was the snippet of his greeting a lady in chinese. I also enjoyed his forays into speed dating (When we've thought of  all scientists as boring?)The sketches of contemporaries like Einstein, Bohr, and Watson, were also entertaining. <br />The writing is hilarious, the science though easy to understand is never dumbed down. We find a man who was incapable of sycophancy, who never lost his childlike fascination for the unknown, and though a theorist, was among the minority of those who could apply what they taught. <br />Read this book and enjoy the life of a man who was intent on enjoying life to the full; enter the mind of one of the greatest minds of the just gone century.	2005-06-30

Now they want justice--justice for the the spate of double murders that took place over a period of months. Enter Paul Madriani and Adrian Chambers. <br />Paul has been appointed temporary DA of Davenport county, and is the lead prosecutor in this case; Adrian, his arch-enemy, will be defending Iganovicth, the alleged killer. <br />Getting Iganovitch convicted could be the least of Madriani's woes, because he must deal with a possible copycat killer, the quicksand of county politics,  two backstabbing justices, and an adversary for whom hitting below the belt is akin to a  pat on the back.  <br />Paul Madriani's hope in all this is to find the elusive Prime Witness. <br />The book finishes on a high note; with a conclusion that leaves you with the stark reality: you've been following the wrong scent. <br />This book lacks the courtroom drama other books in the series have: That might be because Paul is playing in the wrong team--according to Harry Hinds. Instead there is a greater emphasis on the legal process.   <br />I love the brief descriptions of the Coconut and the Prussian, the colorful painting of Chambers; the other characters enliven the story. I do have misgivings about the level of estrangement of Paul's wife.  <br />Like most books in this genre, this one is simply written, though unlike many others, of which I could name a few, this one is highly entertaining.  <br />The Prime Witness is definitely worth a peek.	2005-05-25

The Best Revenge is his revenge for me.   Kelda James is an FBI agent with a superstar status. She assists in exonerating a deathrow inmate who has spent the past thirteen years in the slammer.  Alan Gregory returns in this installment as the psychologist, or as he likes it, the clinical psychologist, who is taking care of both Tom and Kelda.  Alan believes he knows his patients, later realizes he knows less than he thinks; finally he ends up discovering he is a spectator to a violent opera of vengeance that only ends when one of the characters drops dead.  In the hiatus betwen books, I have come to appreciate Stephen White's prose. This story is well written with a part bearing the  unmistakable influence of George Orwell's 1984.  Alan Gregory's presence is not overwhelming, rather his delicate musings, interspersed with jollity provide a departure from the likes of Jonathan Kellerman's Alex Delaware. Nevertheless, in this plot, I would have expected to see Hoppy and Ira more developed.   Though the story is simple, this book can recommended to hold one's attention to the very end.	2005-05-25

And like the latter they are hardly satisfying. Lisa Scottoline's Vendetta Defense is no exception. <br />The description on the front cover gave off that appetizing aroma which enticed me to pick this one out of the others I had on my menu. <br />Judy Carrier, a high flying lawyer, takes a big gamble when she agrees to defend a friend's friend, Pigeon Tony. Tony--of which they are quite a few in this book--is accused of murdering Angelo Coluzzi, a lifelong nemesis, who he suspects killed his wife and son. Pigeon Tony admits to breaking Coluzzi's neck, but denies the charge of murder. <br />In picking this case, Judy goes against the Coluzzi clan, and against her instincts, even as she is magnetically drawn to the defendant's grandson. <br />Lisa Scottoline does her best to whip up a salad of a story,however she comes short: The courtroom scenes are bland; the love story wilted; the plot stale. There is no tension, no action, no nothing. <br />I would be happy if a lawyer could tell me if the hearsay evidence by Bello concerning the coke bottle would be admissible in a real court of law, considering there were no tapes to back it up. <br /> Ms. Scottoline does deserve credit for cooking up a different twist in this bloated genre. <br />If after reading this review, you'd still like to read the Vendetta Defense, good luck to you and BON APPETIT.	2005-05-17

At least for now! In their place comes a geriatric russian spy ring that has been operating in the Minnesota area for nearly half a century. <br />A woman has just witnessed the murder of a man near the Lake Superior shore. What seems mundane suddenly turns out to be anything but,when it is discovered his dad is a russian billionaire mogul. Now the FBI, the locals, the Russians, and Lucas Davenport, must find the killer, to stop the body count from increasing. <br />In this installment, Lucas returns as an innocuous troubleshooter, partnering with a russian intelligence officer, Nadya. Here the villians are not the most violent, or the most cunning, rather they have a hunter's best weapon: suprise.  <br /> <br />Hidden Prey maintains a nice plot, with minimal action; on the other hand, the ending is flat, the characterisation of  Grandpa Walther is bland, with the other members of Lucas's clique: Del, Marcy,etc,  hardly get a mention. Also what happened to Roger's body? <br />VERDICT FOR HIDDEN PREY: A decent novel, though it won't be a good starting point for beginners to the Prey series.	2005-03-28

The Conjurer has already killed three persons, each time escaping under the full glare of the cops. Do they really know his plans? Can he be stopped before he achieves them? Never be certain the world of the Vanished Man. <br />Jeffery Deaver polishes an intriguing subject, magic, and concocts a ghoulish readable thriller. Malerick is the most brilliant antagonist Rhyme and Sachs have met till date. Kara serves not only as a consultant to the police, but also as a teacher to the reader, explaining the methods and the effects of this arcane trade. <br />As with most of the previous works, Rhyme is cornered at home, though, not suprisingly, he escapes for another day. <br />The plot though suffers with the sidekick story about the DA which not only seems fortuitous, but never catches fire. You could term it a Deaver Misdirection. Furthermore, the hairspin twists are so fast and a tad too plenty, some might consider it frustrating. <br />Not me! Considering reading a real book? Try The Vanished Man. <br />	2005-03-26

His assignment: to track down all the passengers of a tour bus that happenchanced to meet with the wreckage of an alien aircraft, and inform his superiors their whereabouts. <br />From Kiev to Moscow, Budapest to Rome, Bellamy chases his quarry, unaware he is a pawn in an apocalyptic chessgame---a pawn of the Doomsday Conspiracy. <br />Sheldon takes a popular and plausible premise, the existence of an alien civilization, and creates a compelling work of fiction. Whether you are a green or a gas guzzler, an alien believer or a skeptic, the pages cling to your fingers till you close the covers. Bellamy as a pining divorcee, Janus as the enigmatic puppetmaster, Susan, a woman torn between two loves, makes for lovely characters. <br />More work could have been done on the ending, still The Doomsday Conspiracy is a novel to savor.	2005-03-21

He  infuses life into those dreary columns we glance at in our newspapers. This does little to curb the ennui that sets in from the first page. <br />It's seems Augustus McKnight had a split personality. How else can one explain that while Gus on one hand couldn't tell his wife was a stripper who had been sleeping with best friend, and her boss, he was nevertheless able to hint at Roger's, Mary's facade. Beats the unfertile imagination, I suppose. <br />Again how can the detective hint at an enraged sibling as a suspect without following it up.  <br />The Day Trader raises more eyebrows than heartbeats, being unable to rise above its pathetic plot.

More can be learned from the failures of men, than from their successes. In this regard, Ben Franklin's life is a gold vault of insight. <br />No one American, dead or living, has elicited so much passion as he has. Not an orator like Patrick Henry, a philosopher like Jefferson, nor a war hero like Washington, he is nevertheless the focal point in any discussion concerning the origins of these United States. <br />Yet he is more than that. <br />In this superb biography by Walter Isaacson, we become acquainted with his formative years in Boston and Philadelphia, and in his brother's printing press; we catch a glimpse of his famous, perhaps infamous, rivalries with the like of the Penns, John Adams. <br />An American Life is written in a bouncy, speedy style that captures Franklin's energy. There is a lot one can learn from his life: his practicality, his love of knowledge, his philanthropy--it's endless. <br />As with all biographies, there are bound to be misplaced facts and nuances; this one being no different. Criticism, therefore, might be justified, though to me it takes nothing away from this colossal figure. <br />Read this book for pleasure; better yet, read it for sense.	2005-02-03

His Chosen Prey are young blonde artsy girls, attracted by his pleasant mien, deceived by his intentions, victims of their own unbridled desires. <br />The police have just gotten a break. The killer is an artist who has been sending victims drawings of them in the nude. With one error after the other, Lucas and his band of brothers are catching up to James; however they be able to get him before he claims his final trophy? <br />John Sandford's Prey series has lived a long and eventful life; its age is now showing. Yet if you think this series is out of spunk, Chosen Prey will sure change your mind. <br />This is a deftly written, morbidly entertaining novel. One wonders how Sandford makes so gruesome a subject so tender to the readers palate. Unlike the previous books, we are shown how the police investigated the killings. Since, there is no suspense given that the killer has been revealed from the beginning, we instead wait anxiously for Lucas's epiphany, made difficult by his personal problems. This interplay--his personal life and work life--is fun to read. <br />Drop that boring stuff you've been reading, and try this out.

This small book--179 pages-- has chapters focussing on some insults of notable Americans, Brits, and nations. It concludes with some unclassified extras. <br />Readers who expect to find funny insults, though there are some, will be disappointed. Others who suppose to pick up some quotable quotes will share a similar fate. The collection is simply an entertaining peek into the thoughts of famous men and their contemporaries. <br />Most of the material is lively, however when compared to the political and journalistic discourse of nowadays, they look rather tame. Harry Truman's comments were weak, undeserving of the pages of the book. Attention should rather be given to Winston Churchill and Ben Franklin, my  caustic favorites. <br />Distory is for those looking for nice metaphors and historical figures.

Sometimes, small details, unseen from a short distance, are obvious from afar.  <br />Alexis de Tocqueville, a visiting diplomat from France, visited the United States ostensibly to study the traditions and freedoms of its inhabitants. Concerned about equality, and its tyranny of the majority, he wanted  to adapt his findings to the fledgling revolution in France. <br />Following his return home, he wrote this treatise, subdividing it; starting with the origin of the Anglo Americans, continuing with the influence of democracy on certain aspects of American life: the intellect, feelings, etc.  <br />Like a doctor dissecting the human body, searching the innards, describing conditions that most often cannot be hinted at externally, de Tocqueville casts a keen eye on all aspects of America. Juxtaposing the American and European systems of government, aristocracy and democracy, one is then sees the pros and cons of the various systems. <br />Democracy in America is written in an easy-to-read, quick-to-grab style. The prose is beautiful, the observations trenchant, the arguments cogent. <br />Lest anyone be mistaken, this work isn't flawless. One of the most glaring being his penchant for simplication for cases like slavery and migration. This produces a work that is indeed accurate, yet imprecise. <br />Still this classic is important because it is bigger an America; it is about the whole freeworld.	2005-01-12

By the end, there will be only one player left standing: The Master of the Game. <br />This is an engaging and provocative novel, tautly written. <br />Sidney Sheldon has excelled in creating strong, independent women; Kate Blackwell must rank as one of his best. <br />We empathize with her, even as she does the wrong things for the right reasosns. From Jamie to Eve, we understand their virtues, even as we recognize their vices. <br />Like the Matrix, the side characters in this elaborate plot are obsessed with choice; the main characters with control. <br />Even when we wonder at the utility of attenuating the males--most be a destructive gene, we still suspend our incredulity for rumination only when the covers are closed. <br />Book lovers, this is entertainment in its purest form. <br />Enjoy	2005-01-12

To do this, they engage in debates based on the merits, with the majority then making decisions. However, debate can be so fractious and uncivil that deliberation is prolonged; also sometimes so many interests need to be catered to that final bills may be worthless. <br />On the other hand, the second assumption, unitary democracy, is that congressmen serve the nation, therefore a consensus (or large majority) is built to make decisions. <br />The problem, though, is who can define the national interests, and when is it superceded  by those of the states. <br />With examples the authors assert that Congress is neither adversarial or unitarian. They also attempt to explain its role in foreign and monetary policy. Chapters 4 and 5 are most enlightening, shedding light on the House rules committee. <br />This is a well researched work, make more educative by quotes from legislators, those active particants in the political goings on. <br />Now, as when it was written, this text is essential for understanding Congress.	2005-01-05

He traces the evolution of political thought from its violent anti-party bias, to the subsequent arguments advocating the acceptance, even the necessity, of parties. <br />From the Englishmen (Bolingdroke, Burke, etc) to the Virginia aristocrats (Jefferson, Madison) to the Albany Regency, we are led by a timeline, showing what each saw in this issue. <br />In this relevant, albeit arcane, area of political science, Hofstadter analyzes and writes lucidly, trenchantly, indeed indifferently.

A 'Black' manifesto falls into the hands of British Intelligence. In it are details of a plan by a presidential candidate in Russia to unleash mayhem, and return the Motherland back to the Stalinist era.  With the British Government pleading hands off, a covert operation is embarked upon. Former CIA spy runner Jason Monk is drafted in to frustrate Komarov's chances in the election. Will he get the job done; if he does, will he escape, alive?  In Icon we get vintage Forsyth: Engaging and contriving. The lot could be picked from any newspaper headline, but only he is capable of infusing life into the story, making it uninterrupted reading. Historical details are sprinkled throughout the book, and his knowledge of British and Russia, as well as disinformation (or propaganda) make it realistic.  Yet with all his bona fides as a storyteller, Frederick Forsyth suffers from a flaw which is magnified in this novel. He distinguishes between good and evil as he does black and white. Therefore we are left in no doubt of where his loyalty lies.   To him, Komarov, the Russian fascist, is bad, so anyone who opposes him is good. Simplistic? Yes, but the truth.   Unfortunately, because of this mindset, we aren't treated to  worthy villians, but instead to a cat and mouse chase where we know the cat's fate.  Still Icon triumphs inspite of its defects.

These gifts, as well as fervor for his cause, cover up  his ignorance of the specific grievances of the colonists. <br />Moreover, ON THE PRESENT ABILITY OF AMERICA, he gets obtuse and is bogged down in detail about the Navy's strength. <br />Nevertheless, even with these minor imperfections, Common Sense is a gem whose value is increased by its impurities. <br />A history of America is incomplete without Paine's magnum opus.	2004-12-07
US	16058734	R8QE40B1SW6RF	0786013567	498783528	Privileged Information	Books	3	1	2	N	N	a typical novel	Alan Gregory, a psychologist, faces ruin when three of his patients die in different settings. In a bid to save his name, his life, and his love, Dr. Alan most unmask this killer who is intent on vengeance.  The noteworthy detail is Lauren's MS, and Stephen White is at his best when showcasing the dilemma of keeping a patient's confidence.  Privileged Information is written leisurely, albeit blandly. Most of the action is carried out in restaurants which mirrors the pace of the novel. Even the interaction between Alan and law enforcement appears contrived.  This book will be most enjoyed when you start it with no expectations.	2004-12-07

US	16058734	R1Z2BPATD8FPZT	0440216850	708015215	Final Argument	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Unarguably good	In the Final Arguments, we are taken on a defense attorney's quest for justice.   Ted Jaffe, as a state prosecutor, put Darryl Morgan on death row for the murder of Solomon Zide. A decade later, he believes he  made a mistake; now as a defense attorney he wants Darryl free.  Fast-paced, suspense-filled, and witty, it's a simple story that is well written. Infact, the best part of the novel was the description of Sweeting's execution.  Clifford Irving depicts the courtroom bantering brilliantly, as well as the political and legal maneuverings.   Though the ending is expected, the plot makes the book worth your time.	2004-12-01

A couple of years later, takes on New York, and the world. <br />From Nova Scotia to Chicago, New York to Amsterdam, The Stars Shine Down describes the life of a woman who knew what she wanted and  was willing to pay the price to get it. <br />Lara Cameron comes off as a flawed, lovable, and tragic heroine; Paul Martin, as a vengeful lover; and Howard Keller, as the apotheosis of passion out of control. <br />Sheldon gives a stellar performance; this is a book to fall in love with.	2004-12-01

The Cardinal Vicar of Rome is assassinated at a celebration with the Pope. However, from thereon the plot descends into banality.  Thomas Kind hardly measures up to the numero uno of assassins, Forsyth's Jackal. With his omnipotence, Cardinal Palestrina bears a closer resemblance to God than to the devil. Even the companionship between the nun and Harry is improbable.Simply put, the novel is malnourished, lacking the nutrients needed to keep it afloat.  By the end, the reader has the feeling that Allan Folsom kills his characters when their utility is exhausted, instead of when the plot demands.  The Day of Confession should be avoided unless necessary.	2004-11-30

The dialogue is lively, and George Fox's monologue was the high point, for me. <br />Nevertheless, the book suffers from obesity.  <br />Not taking anything away, Beach Music is excellent, especially for those who have spare time.	2004-11-30
US	16058734	R37PB5XG9GX6O4	0399150439	893493496	Naked Prey	Books	3	1	2	N	N	we need more	Lucas Davenport returns to do what he does best: clean up potential crises for his political bosses.  In the Naked Prey, he attempts to solve the murder of Jane Warr and Deon Carr, a couple who were found hanging on a tree. When the case is solved, the cops realize it's just the beginning, not the end.  John Sandford does well to suprise us with the familiar i.e., the serial murders, the corrupt cop, the politician in damage control mode. Moreover, he gives us a satisfactory, though expected ending.  Notwithstanding there is a lack of ingenuity which keeps this plot firmly on the ground. It seems Sandford has finally lost the ability to shock his readers.  Naked Prey is still a good novel; which doesn't say much for a writer in Sandford's league.	2004-11-30

When the police investigate the murder of Marian Avery, everyone suspects the husband of the crime. Everyone except Detective Christine Boland.  Overriding the objections of her colleagues, fracturing her friendships, Christine stakes everything, with fatal results.  In this stunning work, William Pease provides strong dialogue, nice plot, and downright pizzazz. While his forte may be the law, being a former US attorney, he excels in the psychological. Even by the last page, the reader will be fumbling for answers.  The Rage of Innocence is simply a superb work.	2004-11-30

Web London, with other members of the elite Charlie Team, go in to a warehouse for a mission. By the time shots have stopped, Web is The Last Man Standing.<br /><br />The book is spent finding out what caused the fiasco. David Baldacci has a good plot with a twist at the end, and does a nice job of describing the fraternity of Hostage and Rescue Teams (HRT).<br /><br />Nevertheless, the book is sunk by the incredulity of the creature called Web London. Instead of coming out as victim, he incurs the sneer of the reader, and ends up as unemotional superman.<br /><br />I don't know much about hynopsis, but in all candor, O Bannon's hynopsis of Web is weak. Maybe that's why it's almost lacking in detail.<br /><br />Last Man Standing is for those who enjoy action without contemplating the veracity of the plot. Any one else: Switch the channel.	2004-11-23

Render Up the Body revels in its simplicity. <br />Lucinda Hayes is a former prosecutor, who forsakes her job as the director of a rape crisis center to represent a death row inmate, Jason Smiley, in his appeal. <br />Marianne Wesson's legal experience serves as an anchor for the book, but her crisp writing is a delight. Cinda Hayes comes across as a lady with issues; Jason Smiley as a murderer who'll grasp at any straw to escape execution. The plot is simple, which means it accomodates complex legal ideas easily, and the end carries the stinger. <br />Lovers of legal thrillers and good writing should have one command: Render up this novel.	2004-11-23

The combined forces of the NYPD, FBI, as well as the INS must stop him before all of immigrants are taken out. <br />Jeffery Deaver excels here and one can almost perceive the inspiration of Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. Sonny Li, an undercover cop from China, is the most outstanding character in the book. <br />Since most detective thrillers are generic, it's good to come across splendid work like this. <br />Lincoln Rhyme fans obviously will enjoy The Stone Monkey, but initiates will also be thrilled by it.	2004-11-18

Dr. Cooke, who is a professor emeritus of political science at University of Pittsburgh, does a good job of explaining the documents clause by clause. <br />He provides background to the genesis of the constitution, and delves a briefly into the mindset of the Founding Fathers. <br />Nevertheless, some troubling parts of the weren't addressed. <br />For one, the first amendment wasn't explained. What exactly is the definition of religion? Could atheism be defined as religion? <br />Secondly, isn't the right to bear arms in the second amendment  <br />contingent on the first clause of that amendment? <br />Also, I would have liked to see more examples of cases where judges made law instead of interpreting it. <br />On the whole, though, the book should be a great help to those who are beginners to the constitution, especially high school students and foreigners. For anyone else, pick a heavier tome.	2004-11-18

What could get a group of ten individuals, five from both political parties, to work together and release a unanimous and comprehensive report? <br />To find out, read the Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States(aka 911 Report). <br />The investigation details how the terrorist threat emerged, what happened on that day, and how the United States can prevent another attack. <br />It is simply written, though not simple, and is easy to understand. Chronicling the rise of Osama bin Laden and his terror network al-Qaeda provide a context for most Americans who were either unaware or deliberately ignorant of the threat faced by the nation. <br />Nevertheless, while the overview was good, there wasn't enough time spent on the minutiae such as civil liberties (Patriot Act), the borders, the cost of preparation on the economy, the difference in opinion over the threat (Europe and the US), the public's role, the war in Iraq, and the oversight of the Congress. <br />However, since not every question was meant to be answered, the 911 report is a prerequisite for those who want to know what happened on that fateful day.	2004-11-12

Also suspense was lacking, given that most of the book was dedicated to Merci's musings.  <br />The unforeseen climax at the end is worth the time. <br />I would advise against buying the book(since it isn't close to classic), but rather would suggest borrowing it from  the library. <br />ATTENTION: Red Light is not for people with short attention spans.	2004-11-09
