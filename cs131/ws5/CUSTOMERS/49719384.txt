But this novel has a contemporary setting and is more conventional than his previous offering.  While the author does manage to deliver multiple viewpoints on an extremely complicated environmental issue, he does so through the eyes of a single narrator.  There is a love interest and some characters that might seem like the stock variety if you're not from this area.   <br /> <br />Most of the power in this story is generated not by the emotional conflict of its characters, but by the author's ability to frame the simplistic with startlingly accurate, poetic imagery.  Sure there are symbolic elements like the river as death, the human as the transitory beast that yearns for purpose, but what holds it all together is the prose style of a man who is certainly one of our finest poets.	2005-01-05

With Silva, the reader always gets the sense that it is more than just poetry, more than just lyrical prose.  Indeed, his own religious and political intentions pervade this work and give it a kind of neo-Blakean presence.  And as in Blake, the reader may encounter work that seems muddled in esoteric complexity, but is as simple as Silva is able to make it.  Besides the visionary, in this huge collection, there is much work that is straightforward, often allowing the reader an inside-out perspective on Silva's schizophrenia.  <br />Silva's auto-biographical persona, Sef, appears frequently in the lyrical prose pieces that are at times haltingly poetic.  There is much to praise in the poetry of this volume as well.  Silva's poems are a study in sound effect and tonal juxtaposition.  <br />Like Jim Chandler's recent collection, Silva's is long overdue, and the publisher should be commended for bringing out this much overlooked talent.	2003-07-25

Chandler has operated as a kind of southern Bukowski since the early 70's when his work began to appear in magazines and literary journals around the country. <br />SMOKE AND THUNDER delivers a large sample of his powerful,often raw, yet more often elegant poetry. Chandler moves easily from narrative to elegy to the occasional rant, bearing the reader along with a lyrical sense that is not bound by structure or literary convention. <br />Chandler best describes himself as a survivalist in his aptly titled \\"hillbilly rasputin:\\"<BR>i know now<BR>i go on<BR>i will go on<BR>i cannot <BR>be stopped <BR>by death<BR>the hole<BR>or anything<br />i am eternal<BR>fire<br />clutching what<BR>i know<BR>holding it<br />to heart.	2003-04-15

Nowhere else have I seen a writer bring so much life and poetry to descriptions of a game that, aside from Updike, has rarely received literary treatment or scrutiny.  <br />Conroy takes the reader to the hardwood floors of small college arenas and into the steamy locker rooms of a broken down team and its half-crazed coach.  As he traces his own &quot;glory&quot; days, Conroy attempts to understand the psychology of the overachievers (his coach and dad) that fail to find joy in the lesser accomplishments of their own charges.  <br />Anyone who has played under such conditions at the high school or college level will recognize the accuracy of many of Conroy's observations (Conroy confirms in print with his comments on modern players turning the ball over a condition that I have long thought has cheapened the sport). Those of us that have never let go of the competitive fires described here will bask in them again.  <br />This is an exceptional sports book; unlike his novels, there is little fat that needs to be trimmed.  It is work of both great pride and great humility.	2002-12-30

In fact, EDEN does not have the feel of a first novel.  Into the mix the writer pours ghostly imagery, mystery, indirect old testament allusions and the great themes of loyalty and moral retribution.  <br />The setting is as startlingly real as in Rash's poems of Apalachia. The characters and language are authentic, and the author manages to nail all five of the narrative voices that reveal each layer of the story.  <br />ONE FOOT IN EDEN is a fine accomplishment by a man who has already established himself in another genre.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2002-12-02

But even with a first novel, one can not overlook the sloppy storytelling that plagues parts of THE BRIDGE.  There are simply too many inconsistencies.  Is the narrator brilliant or dull?  At one moment he is capable of great insight; at another he fails to see anything but surfaces.  <br />Perhaps I expected too much after reading Pat Conroy's blurb; no one could live up to such hype.  Maybe Conroy didn't read COLD MOUNTAIN or any of a dozen or more first novels by NC writers that are far superior to Marlette's nevertheless admirable first effort.	2002-05-29

And I must admit that CELEBRATION contains some of the fascinating elements that drew me to his other works.  The biggest problem here is that the story is too far over the top.  Furthermore, the characters tend to be fantastic rather than fiercely real, as we've come to expect from this writer.  Nevertheless, the book is filled with shimmering passages of prose that are reminiscent of earlier work and is a far cry better than the disastrous MULCHING OF AMERICA.	2002-05-24

As in AMONG THE BELIEVERS, this poet demonstrates an uncanny ability to create rhythmic short lines (seven syllables).  <br />Rash closes a poem as well as anyone writing today.  As a result, the ghosts in these poems, of the Jocassee Valley and its aqua-burial and of the revisited ancestors and historical figures will haunt the reader beyond the pages of the book. <br />Finally, what sets Rash apart from many of his contemporaries is his ability to recognize and to develop valid poetic topics.  There is nothing superficial, superfluous, or forced in the pages of this volume.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2002-05-03

A reader of his previous novels will recognize character types from past books.  But CS does not rely on the intentions or attention of quirky southern personalities.  Instead, at its heart is its protagonist, Will Bagget. CS becomes an outstanding study of a dynamic character.  Along the way, the book touches on the themes of relationships, loyalty, and ethical choices.  <br />Inman tests his own nerve as a writer here, taking risks, layer-by-layer revealing the story, all the way to the bone.  CAPTAIN SATURDAY captures emotional lightning and gives it back to the lucky reader.	2002-05-03

There are player quotes, journalistic snippets, and even a famous comedic routine.  <br />Finally, the art work is stunning and layed out in a way that accentuates both the visual and verbal aspects of the book.

I recall that this was the case for this writer when the book was first published.  <br />When I read CAFES OF CHILDHOOD, I was caught up in the drama and the powerful but spare use of language.  I did not read the book as an indictment of the poet's family.  He could just as easily have been writing in a persona.  Poetry doesn't have to be factually accurate anyway, just moving and memorable. This book is both, and it is a surprise to me that Macioci has not pubished another.	2001-08-13

In it he proves himself a supreme storyteller.  Most of his characters from the underbelly of east Fayetteville, NC, are well-developed and believable.  McLaurin understands that the heartbreaking and triumphant moments in life are often entertwined.  The doomed character Bubble is a near perfect rendering of alchoholism's slow burning gravity, while his nephew, the protagonist, rises from those very flames toward a promising future.<br />THE ACORN PLAN is not as carefully written as McLaurin's latter books, but it is written with a great deal of passion.	2001-08-07

Finally, with the arrival of the summer semester, I had time to at first peruse and then devour THE LOST SEA.<br />Quite frankly, Keith Flynn is an undiscovered genius.  Not since the late 70s when I first read Leo Connellan have I seen work that so thoroughly combines the passion of the human heart with a power and ease of language.  <br />The range in subject matter is equally impressive: from classical art and music to the politically topical, from Rasputin to Ruby Ridge to My Lai.  <br />Flynn's musical poetry works on many levels, but its strength mainly lies in powerful, original language.  Crisp vivid imagery is elevated by imaginative metaphors and similes.  <br />Flynn, a musician/songwriter as well, writes splendidly about both music and art.  Here are just a few snippets from this HIGHLY RECOMMENDED book:<br />from &quot;The Painter as Mantis Sings the Blues&quot;<br />Painting is a very large plow carving its duty/ across the terrain of the dispossessed.<br />from &quot;Agama&quot; Like the remaining pieces of the snake/that slide toward one another/ even after rake has rent them apart,/the poet is the priest of the invisible<br />from &quot;Lessons in Hunger&quot; The room was filled/with her last sigh,/like a lily that breaks on the water/in a sudden bubble/and then the long horrid whine/of hospital machinery/with nothing left to do.	2001-06-07

Its continent-leaping plot begins and ends with the simplistic lives of the &quot;sand lizard&quot; Indians of the southwest.  The great themes of greed and ambition are visited along the way as well as the more intimate ones of loyalty and courage.  <br />As one might expect, when the &quot;civilized&quot; world intrudes into that of the young Indian girls, conflict and betrayal are the result.  But politically correct ideas are not played out heavyhandedly here.  Deep character development and the heartbreaking story itself are the priority of this writer.<br />I rarely savor a novel as much as I did this one.  In fact, while reading dozens of others concurrently, this one took nearly half a year.  There's a marvelous amount of gravity working in these pages.	2001-05-08

Saenz, a passionate writer and reader of poetry, infuses this novel with his poetic verve.  The plot, a modernized, ramped-up version of Hawthorne, is well-paced and for the most part carefully laid out.  The weakness would have to be in the characterizations: the rugged independent-minded good cop, dog-kicked for his honesty, and the equally independent, honest and hardworking female public defender, who just happens to be attractive and southern. Unfortunately, we know these folks from tv.  The reclusive (and of course famous) academic and his goddess kidnap victim are more realistic.  <br />For intriguing, escapist reading, this book is recommended, not for overall literary accomplishment.	2001-04-27

Roll the search engines and you will be amazed at the sheer abundance of what they sniff out.<br />WW was published in 1995 a few years before Locke began to float his work on our screens.  This book reveals a man who is a true master at the art of imagistic poetry.  Many of the poems like &quot;Trestle,&quot; &quot;White Tree by the Gulf,&quot; and &quot;The Dwarf&quot; deliver a solid concrete image in every line.  The rhythm and language are also strong.  <br />On the other hand, this book contains poems that though well-written and intellectual in nature are just not interesting. Beyond this, there are a few like &quot;The End of Something&quot; and &quot;Love in the Eighties&quot; that are self-absorbed and arrogant.  These poems, so typical of the kind of academic drivel that has driven readers away from the genre, greatly detract from the effect of this book. Locke is clearly a genius, and with his vast experience in both academia and the arts, should know better. <br />Fortunately, Locke finishes strong with a final series of poems which return the reader to his best image-driven work.	2001-04-17

Don't be fooled by the cover.  This is not the traditional &quot;baseball book.&quot; <br />Here, baseball is simply another place on the stage, a venue for participation, a venue where great tragedy and joy both occur.  The novel is well-paced and anchored by memorable characters, not your ordinary &quot;buddy&quot; characters, however.  The reader may have difficulty finding something to like about the hapless Walter Innis.  But as his history is revealed, layer by layer, his honesty and complete lack of pretention should garner a measure of sympathy.  It is gratifying to see such a gifted writer use the undying baseball metaphor.	2001-04-09

Watson, the victim of a ruthlessly manipulative father, hitchhikes out of town for the weekend and by chance encounters the early 70's drug/subculture in a way that he had not expected.  <br />The centerpiece for the novel is perhaps the most accurate description I have seen of an LSD trip.  Watson's experience becomes a doorway to a better understanding of himself and his future.  This is a rare look at the intellectual side of the psychedelic adventure.  <br />Monroe draws his characters unpretentiously and holds the reader to the page with an unflinching desire for realism.  Only the dialogue is a little weak, but one will find that the power of the writing grows as the book advances, and that the Bukowski-esque father and son scenes are indeed riveting.	2001-03-09

AMONG THE BELIEVERS is a collection of narrative poetry that has as its heart life in the rural mountain areas of western North Carolina. <br />Because of the attention given to form and a rhythm that is generated by a deft scattering of alliteration, slant and internal rhyme, ATB is at once a poet's poetry.  But the reader who reads for content only will be rewarded as well by the questions asked and answered by these poems.<br />ATB is broken into five parts which either cover different themes or provide alternative perspectives on the material.  For instance, Part IV all directly concerns the poet's own life, no personas.  Part II is enlivened by first and third person personas that speak largely on the religious theme of the book.<br />But there are many kinds of believers in this book, religious worshippers, farmers who look for signs, and even a man who must believe his own encounter with a catamount that scientists have proven nonexistent in the area.  <br />Do yourself a favor and pick this one up; there is no doubting this man's ability.	2001-02-16

Rash, who is also a fine poet, now establishes himself as one of the best new southern fiction writers.  Rising to the top in this crowded field is not such an easy task, but this collection of heartfelt, challenging and sometimes disturbing stories should be the drawstring that brings his star up from the well.  <br />Imaginative and yet often grimly realistic, stories like &quot;Dangerous Love&quot; where a young woman falls in love with a carnival knife thrower and &quot;Overtime&quot; where David Thompson makes a tragic appearance as &quot;Cedric&quot; are sure to move the reader.  <br />The fact that Rash has in his life straddled the line between his blue collar roots and his academic destiny is clear in this work. While some of the writing might remind one of Larry Brown, the physical violence of Brown's work is substituted for here by a more subtle violence of the heart.  I highly recommend this collection and look forward to whatever might be next.	2001-01-17

It is filled with wonderful juxtapositions.  Armstrong is arrogant but honest, tremendously focused yet capable of shallow flightiness, loving and predatory. In other words, he proves to be thoroughly human.<br />As a recreational cyclist and longtime fan of the sport, I followed with great interest the career of this young Texan.  I remember hearing the devestating news of his illness and like many other people was shocked to witness perhaps the greatest comeback in sports history.  This book gives the reader a behind-the-scenes perspective on these events.  It is well-arranged and paced so that the inspired reader hits no dead spots.  Don't, however, expect to find a completely likeable guy. Armstrong's competitive nature makes Michael Jordan look like, well, a boy scout.	2001-01-15

TC Boyle is an imaginative bottomless pit of intriguing short fiction ideas.  At 691 pages, this collection is a comprehensive look into the mind of one of our most talented prose stylists. Boyle is, in fact, at his luinous best in the shorter work.  While his novels become at times ponderous, the reader will not find that to be true in the shorts.<br />There are way too many great stories to mention here, but a few highlights for me were &quot;Heart of a Champion,&quot; &quot;The Human Fly,&quot; The Ape Lady in Retirement,&quot; &quot;Mexico,&quot; and &quot;Bloodfall.&quot;  I've taught &quot;Greasy Lake&quot; for years to survey Lit classes who have typically found Boyle, if nothing else, to be provocative.  <br />Boyle's presence over the years in the highbrow New York magazines should solidify his place among American writers of his generation.

THE DAY... collects his short stories and poems about baseball.<br />There is nothing highbrow about this collection; indeed, the writer manages to imprint in his stories the love of a game that has as its roots, the rural and small town areas of the country. Shannon is no Cormac McCarthy, but his stories have a great deal of heart and enough intrigue to grab the reader's interest.  <br />The poems, which are assembled from three previous shorter collections, are written in the straight-ahead fashion that I have come to expect from Shannon.  He has lived close to the game, and these poems take the reader there.  Whether he's writing about Willie Mays, Ernie Banks, or the troubled Pete Rose Reds of the 80's, there's never any doubt about the authenticity of his knowledge, never any doubt that he will deliver work that is both entertaining and moving.	2000-11-22

There can be no question that TC Boyle is a masterful manipulator of words and storyteller.  These two qualities shine through in this dark recent effort.  However, I found it hard to give this one a five-star rating because, unlike in the other of his books I've read, his main characters seemed stereotypical or maybe even displaced from a Harlan Ellison or Orson Scott Card work. In fact, Boyle should really leave the quasi-science fiction writing to the quasi-writers. <br />The philosophy here which tends more toward nihilism than anything else is sure to put off some readers who want to be sympathetic to the characters.  And though he tries hard with Tierwater, there is no resemblence between him and your typical anti-hero buddy character.  I have to, however, ask, do we really have to have sympathetic &quot;buddy&quot; characters to foster our reading experience?  Sometimes, perhaps, powerful high quality prose should be enough to sustain us.  I would be the first one to admit that this novel is not on the same level with WORLD'S END or even RIVEN ROCK; nevertheless, I would not deny myself the chance to enjoy, one more time, a prose stylist that rises above nearly everyone else writing these days.	2000-11-09

It's been a while since I've read a writer that so thoroughly closed the aesthetic distance between the text and the reader.  Connelly's powers of description are enormous, poetic, and relentlessly original.  He manages, somehow, to anchor the plot to a narrator that floats and characters that scurry in and out of the narrative like alley rats.  BRINGING OUT THE DEAD is a must read for anyone that wishes to become involved with big city emergency medicine.  It is also a must for readers that care about excellent writing that covers the many familiar bases of the post-modern novelist: isolation, alienation, chaos, the anit-hero.	2000-10-17

Connecticut's poet laureatte is one of America's best kept  literary secrets, and this is his most powerful, fully realized work.	2000-06-13

My experience with this writer has always been that you don't pick up one of his books purely for entertainment.  In fact, the complexity of the telling and the tale in  parts one and two of this trilogy approach Faulkner.<br />I found CITIES, in  terms of plot and style, to be less complex, more reader-friendly.   However, even writing in this more traditional sense, McCarthy maintains  the edge that sets him apart from most of his American contemporaries.  The  simplicity and poetry of the phrasing is still there, the marvelous  descriptions, the dead perfect dialogue, still crisp and efficient.  <br />And  even though you know what's going to happen if you've read the earlier  works, you can't help but be tantalized and magnetized and pulled along.   The suspense and style that Larry Brown emulates in his southern underbelly  novels is raised a couple levels by the hand of this master writer.  <br />In  creating this more readable conclusion to the Border Trilogy, McCarthy may  have blown his chance at the Nobel (rumors of his shortlisting abound among  the writers I've spoken to).  But with CITIES, he allows us to go along for  the ride with little more than a dusting off of that rusty Spanish.	2000-06-08

This novel reveals his gift as a story teller without sacrificing his obvious abilities as a poet.  <br />Morgan knows the land, the  work and the people that he deals with here.  There are few places you will  see a better depiction of turn of the century living in rural Western North  Carolina. The fire and ice symbols that repeat in the novel give it a rich  texture.  <br />Maybe most outstanding here are the moments he creates when  his narrator has a charismatic Christian experience.  Morgan's approach to  this &quot;backwoods&quot; religion is sympathetic and never heavy handed.   Highly recommended.<br />Our students had a great time with this book in the  fall, first in the class and then discussing it with Morgan when he came to  our campus.	2000-05-24

But this one is seriously uneven and ponderous.  This is not to say that there are not compelling moments within  the pages, some well-written, memorable scenes.  But the edginess of the  novel seems artificial, as if Irving chose his subject this time, not  because it grew out of his heart, but to prove that he COULD.  This is a  writer that really shouldn't feel that he has anything left to prove.  The  clever plot devices and repetitious metaphors are there as expected, but  what seems to be lacking are characters that draw the typical level of  reader interest or sympathy.	2000-05-23

Baldwin tries hard and at times achieves that &quot;out there in oblivion&quot; feeling of a Faulkner work.  The title character is a memorable wretch, and there  are some other instances of solid character development.

Futhermore, the early '90s books, BODY and THE KNOCKOUT ARTIST had him back  on the track he had cut with the early novels.  Unfortunately, the same can  not be said for this near travesty.  MULCHING, as an idea, has great  promise, but the work reads like a rough draft.  The author wants so badly  for the audience to embrace the bizarre protagonists of this book, that he  sacrifices plot and often sense to accomodate them.  Rather than a scathing  sendup on American business, MULCHING becomes a parody of its own ideas, a  product without substance.	2000-05-16

Having vacationed at the outer banks of NC a number of times, I can tell  you that this work transports you there.  Steinke is efficient and poetic  in her use of language, and her plot is loosely framed on the cycles of  season and life with the time worn metaphor of water as rejuvenation  somehow freshened through her young eye.	2000-05-16

Strangely enough, I received this  book of letters two days later as a gift.  This collection proves to be a  unique kind of auto-biography in which the reader witnesses the development  of a much-underrated prose stylist from his high school years to the late  1960's.  <br />More than just &quot;gonzo&quot; hyperbole, the contents of  this volume are entertaining, charming, forthright, and at times  prophetic--an early sixties prediction that Reagan would one day be  president, for example.  I would not have thought that I would say this,  but it was the best read of that summer.	2000-05-16

Cody's narrative is not only sympathetic to  the boy and the mother and brother he left behind, but also to the abusive  kidnapper and to the various teachers, waitresses, and others that cross  their escape path.  The stream of consciousness narrative elements that  emanate from a death row cell reveal Cody as an outstanding prose stylist.	2000-05-16

The book is essentially a lengthy illustration essay that employs narrative accounts of numerous  adolescents and their families.  Long provides through his firsthand  experience, a frightening but sympathetic glimpse at one of the untold  results of the war that turned a generation upside down.  It is a story  filled with cruelty and abandonment on both an individual and a national  level.  Perhaps the most valuable component of this study is the actual  dialogue between Long and his wards.  Long is engaging and wise, and the  words of his &quot;clients&quot; are often terrifying and explicit.	2000-05-16

However, what this book really has going  for it is a passion for the art and a passion for his variety of subjects.   All the mechanical skills in the world cannot replace a love for your art.   Rodriguez has this and more.  In this volume there is great humor and great  sadness, love, bitterness, loneliness and great strength, the strength of a  poet-warrior.	2000-05-15

Sounes put a great deal of time and effort into tracking the myth and reality of this best selling poet and public madman.  This is the most  balanced account of Bukowski's life which means he comes out looking like a  very talented but wretched human being who eventually turned on most of his  friends by creating unfavorable representations in his work.  There are all  kinds of intriguing music-related tidbits: his jealousy of Pete Townshend,  his immediate recognition of U2 as a sellout band, despite dedicating a  concert to he and his wife, his turndown of a photo shoot with Madonna even  though Sean Penn was a regular drinking buddy.  Written in a fast-paced  fictionalized narrative, this one is a sure winner.	2000-05-15

If you want the insider's  perspective on subjects such as cockfighting, dogfighting, raptor training,  insanely heavy drinking and occasional womanizing, this is the place to go.   A warning: Crews is not for the weak hearted.  His ability to relate  realistic violence has influenced the likes of Robert Morgan (of recent  Oprah fame) and Larry Brown.	2000-05-15

Donal Hall is perhaps the last living connection we have to the golden era of early 20th century poetry. Here you will find firsthand accounts of his contact with giants like TS Eliot, Dylan Thomas, Ezra Pound, Robert Frost, and Yvor Winters. <br />Hall's prose is so delightfully engaging, and these profiles go far beyond literary namedropping. In fact, [Remembering Poets] should be required reading for any graduate or post-graduate English scholar. Of all of this writer's many accomplishments, this book certainly ranks near the top.	2000-05-12

However, one of the real keys to Brody's success, that might get overlooked, is his ability to invite the reader into his  poems.  He accomplishes this by speaking to or about the familiar second  person, a technique usually frowned upon.  But with a quality reading of  these poems, the reader can't help but become the constant &quot;you,&quot;  therefore, closing the aesthetic distance and building on the intensity  that already exists in the words and imagery:  can you picture the porter/  classically Negro,/ his psalm that of Suffering itself./ And he calls for  your ticket,/ but you've lost it, or have you,/ and the tunnel is opening  its mouth?&quot;  From &quot;Riding the Zephyr&quot;  <br />The poem invites  the reader to ride the rail into Chicago as well as, metaphorically, the  rail to these &quot;fields&quot; of poems.  The fertile fields of the  midwest become the poet's own fertile wife in &quot;On Learning I'm to be a  Father Again:&quot;  Against his body/ She's slender as the sky earlier/ in  the evening is.  The fields/ come closer, restrained by roads/ Vaporous as  the ink an octopus/ ejects...&quot;<br />The status of this book speaks  volumes about the place of this art form in our culture.  For though it won  Brody a Robert Frost Breadloaf Fellowship and praise from established  writers like Leo Connellan and Fred Chappell, FIELDS never sold like ION  Books had hoped.  And now like many artful treasures in our culture, it has  graduated into oblivion.	2000-05-02

It reminds one of Harry Crews or Larry Brown. God help me for saying this, but Franklin portrays a kind of pastoral weirdness and brutality with an unflinching eye.  At some point, readers are going to have to ask how much unflinching  they can take.  <br />Some of the early stories in the book are not as  realized as they might be, but the payoff is the tour de force that is the  title story at the end. &quot;Poachers&quot; is a memorable little novella  that will leave readers looking forward to Franklin's novel.	2000-04-27

Brown takes us back to the underbelly of Mississippi life in this sequel to JOE.  Bobbie Ann Mason  once said that writing a novel is like laying pipe.  Well, Brown lays a lot  of pipe in this one.  And although he never overwrites a character or a  scene, the plot does become a bit tedious in a few places, something that's  never happened in a Brown novel.  From what I understand, the original  manuscript was a monster.  <br />The tension and suspense that he developed in  FATHER AND SON serves Brown well this time.  The inevitable collision of  forces as represented by key characters will hurl you through the final  chapters.  It is a &quot;last man standing&quot; conclusion that you're not  likely to forget.<br />The greatest accomplishment, however, is the fully  developed title character.  Fay is Brown's ultimate &quot;buddy  character,&quot; sure to draw reader sympathy.  But, she is as tough as any  male character that may have dominated his previous pages.  Most of all,  she is a survivalist, surviving the wilderness of strip joints and trailer  parks, gravitating toward the kindness of complex strangers.<br />Rumor has it  that FAY is the middle book in a trilogy.  Readers can only hope.	2000-04-26

Sure, it's about baseball and the almost religious nature of its practice during this time and place.  But there is so much more in the details about social structure , convention and the fine line between the  public and private.  <br />Utley and Verner were quite diligent with their  research.  The collection of photos and the league statistics corroborate  the many anecdotes and colorful player profiles.  The linear narrative is  perfect and puts some rails under what might have otherwise been a  haphazard assembly of good yarns. I highly recommend this book to anyone  who cares about baseball, the pioneer spirit, and well-documented history.	2000-04-19

Here the reader will confront not the business-as-usual poetry of contemporary America, but rather a passionate  verse that is a throwback to a time when sound and rhythm were at least as  important as content.  Just a sample from &quot;Prayers to an Infant  King&quot;:       One morning again!      One wind-shot dawn!      One ache       of the sea      and the sky      and the palm.<br />DE LA PALABRA is a  collection of twenty-eight mostly brief, highly religious poems.  But as  Ron Bayes notes in the foreward, these are poems that often &quot;shake a  fist at God&quot; out of love and despair:      But what corpse do we  worship?      and is it for naught but stones      or is it indeed for  bread... Besides his advanced sense of lyricism, Silva also creates much  memorable imagery as in &quot;Seeking Plenty&quot;:      Riches, riches and  sick      despair.  Even on a tropical island,      the black hoof of  God... If you are looking for a poetry that borrows from the past to create  something extraordinarily fresh and new, that at once startles, then  instructs, then Sam Silva may be for you, and DE LA PALABRA is a good place  to start.	2000-04-10
