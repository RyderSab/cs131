This is the first book I read by Deaver, and he's a fantastic writer, I'll be getting more of his books. He has what others wrtiers lack...the ability to keep the reader glued to every page, untill the end!<br />This is the story of a killer. What makes this killer so special? His name is Phate, and he uses computers to help kill people. Phate sneaks in your computer, finds everything about you, and uses it aganist you. How do you catch a computer killer? You need to get an excellent computer hacker to help you. This is where Gillette comes in, he's a computer hacker, with strong skills. Where did Gillette come from? You'll have to read and find out. What I liked about Gillette is that for most of the book, it's the readers job to decide if Gillette is a good or a bad guy. For most of the book the reader will be flip floping trying to figure out who Gillette really is.<br />Deaver did an excellent job with his computer references. Granted  the computer program in this book isn't real...it could be real in the near furture. Deaver did his homework on the early computers.<br />Deaver keeps the reader hooked to the book through the *entire* book. He has wonderful characters that are believable and a lot of plot twists. <br />This is a fantastic read and I highly suggest this book, you won't be sorry.	2003-07-23

If you haven't seen the last season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, then this is for you. To me, and any fans of the show, this reads as an episode guide or a Reader's Digest version of the last season.<br />This is the story of what happens to Buffy when an evil known as The First come to Sunnydale to open up the hellmouth.<br />The first thing that made this book alomost impossible to read is all the typo's in this. This was driving me insane. We had words spelled wrong, wrong word in the sentence, the punctuation marks were wrong, use of the wrong tense of a word, quoation marks all over the place that seemed to have no logical placemant. Many times, the quote ended, but you never saw where they start, and the use of The First. (notice the cap T and the cap F. The only time we should see \\"T\\"he \\"F\\"irst is when it 's refering to the character, as in The First evil that walked the Earth.  But not in this book..it was The First shower.....The First words out of his mouth...this was really annoying. It's said that the blame should be on the copy editor....maybe...but not all the typo's. At the end of a question, you want this...\\"?\\"....not...\\" / \\"...which that happened a couple of times. This isn't the first time this has happened to a Holder book, the same thing happened in Blood and Fog? Something tells me  that all of the blame can't be set at the feet of the copy editor.<br />It seems that the episodes glossed over important events. Remember Cassie? Well, her ep, a few things weren't even mentioned, this is just laziness on the part of the author. In one ep, Willow was captured by a creature that wanted to eat her flesh (and did) but this was just glossed over by Holder. If she's going to do this, this should have been done right. <br />I'd like to see all the seasons done this way (in one book) but just give the show the justice it deserves, and not do a \\"cliffnotes\\" version as Holder has done.<br />It was nice to look back and see how the final season took shape, but this was an episode guide at best.	2003-07-03

This picks up right where the 4th books leaves off, including the emotions that Harry feel. He has to come to terms with his guilt over the death of Diggory, a disgrunted house elf, Malfoy and company, girls, Quidditch, oh yeah, and who know who's back.<BR>    Let me say this...this is a dark book.<BR>    A new prof, Umbridge, is at Hogwarts to make sure that Hogwarts is teaching the things that the Ministry of Magic feels it should teach. If this is not done, Prof Umbridge..well let's just say...she has a lot of power and she had the full support of the Minstry behind her.<BR>   Here's a smally summary of the plot. Voldormort has found a way to enter Harry's dreams, and this changes Harry. Harry's temper is shot, and he lashes out at everyone..even those who are closest to him. He has to find a way to stop Voldormort and save the people he loves. I don't want to say more that that b/c if I do...it will give major spoilers away, and enought has been given away abou this book.<BR>   It was interesting to see how the charachters change, and one character changed not for the good. This is a char we once liked, not the reader will grow to dislike the char a lot...and we love it! It adds such a new twist to the book. It will be interesting how the char is seen by the other characters when certain secrets are out at the end of the book. Will this char be taken back by the rest? Or will be be shunned? TIme will tell. <BR>   I love the Twins in this book!! They are one of my favorite characters in this series. They were fantastic.<BR>   The writing style of Rowling is amazing! She keeps the reader glued to the page in hopes to find out more about the characters that we've grown to love and hate. I was so glued to this book, I read it in 2 1/2 days! I couldn't put this down.<BR>    There's a battle at the end of the book that is just outstanding. Four years of magic are used in the fight. They way Rowling describe the events that are going on, it makes you feel like you're in the middle of the action<BR>    A lot of questions will be answered. What did Hagrid to? What did Snape have to do at the end of book four. Any why is Dumbledore ingoring Harry? Some questions that go all the way back to the first book will be answered.<BR>     I highly suggest you run, not walk  to your nearest book seller and get this book. If you haven't started the series...I have three words for you...shame...on...you...This is a wonderful series. <BR>   Enjoy the series that Rowling sets out for us. I can't wait for the next book.	2003-06-23

However, in Sanford's past several Prey novels, we haven't seen the old Davenport. He's much softer and kinder. This book, the characterazation of Davenport is just as mild and bland as ever.<br />This story open with two bodies that are found strung up in a tree. Soon Davenport and Co. are call in to to solve the case. I don't want to give to much away, so that's all I'll say about the plot.<br />I did like the Character of Letty. I liked her a lot. I hope to see her in other Prey books.<br />I guess I'm used to the old Davenport and the way he dealt with problems. I haven't seen this in several books.<br />The writing is pretty good. There are some nice plot twists. I kept on reading Naked Prey in hope to see the old Davenport, but that never happened.	2003-05-21

When I heard there was going to be a book about Buffy and Spike going after Jack the Ripper, I was so excited. I went to Barnes and Noble almost everyday to see if the book came in. I was really looking forward to reading this. Man, this was such a let down. I'm sure at one time, Nancy Holder watched Buffy to learn the characters, but it's obvious that she hasn't watched it in a while. She often called Spike a \\"white\\" haired vampire. White hair? My tv's colors must be off, b/c it looks like he has blonde hair to me.<br />There was also the issure of Spike making plans with the Doc to kill Buffy and Dawn. He'd *never* try to kill Dawn, it's been proven time and time again that  Spike has gone out of his way to protect Dawn. He loves her like a sister. Spike would never hurt dawn.<br />Another problem I had was at one point Willow was thinking about druggin Dawn. Willow is like an Aunt to her, and would never hurt her. I know that Willow caused a car accident and Dawn was hurt, but that's it. No drugging or anything like that.<br />What also annoyed me with this book is that there were like 4 stories going on at the same time, and it was  hard to keep all the stories straight.<br />If you are a Buffy fan, then skip this book at all costs. I wouldn't even suggest you get this at a used book shop or at the library. It's not worth your time.<br />There are some wonderful Buffy books out there....this just isn't one of them.	2003-05-04

When I heard about this book, I went to many book stores and libraries to find it. I finally did and was very excited to read it. I was very disappointed in t his books. This is nothing like Survivor or \\"reality shows\\". It alomst seems like the \\"reality\\" aspect was just an afterthought. What this is really about bioterrorism.<br />The characters are so weak, and flat, its' not funny. They act in away that makes the characters unreal. The dialouge is flat people just dont' talk that way.<br />I suggest that if you like shows like Survivor then stay away from this 24/7.<br />*hold paper with 24/7 on it. It's time to leave, the tribe has spoken.	2003-03-23

I came across this book on a book display, and bought it with eagnerness and looking forward to enjoy a Laymon book. This isn't one of his better books, as a matter of fact, it was one of my least  favorite of his.<br />The plot is interesting. A group of college students break out an ouija board and make contact with a ghost named Butler. This ghost promises them a great treausre if they just do what the ghost tells them to.  I don't want to give much more out, but let's just say that things don't  end the way the college kids think it will.<br />I had a few problems with this book. 1) The characters. Most of them were annoying. I honestly don't think that people would act the way the the charcaters did in the book. 2) The writing. The doalouge wasn't true to everyday people either. I just can't believe that people would talk that way. 3) The conversatations weren't true to life. I mean, there was 2 1/2 pages of charcaters talking if they should go to the bathroom. 4)The conclusion. It was a major let down. <br />I think Darkess, Tell Us, could have been a wodnerful book. Notice I said &quot;could have&quot;.<br />If you like Laymon as much as I do, try and find the book in a used bookstore.	2003-03-09

That hurts a lot for me to say b/c I love King, but I have to be honest.  Send this one to the scrap heap and sell it for parts.<br />This is the story of a car, and how it changed the life for some officers and the people around them. I can't say much more, b/c I don't want to give away the plot.<br />When I was finished with this book, I had a lot of questions. Such as, what happened to a certian officer? Where did the car come from (though I do have an idea)? Who was the driver?<br />If you want to read it, be my guest, but don't expect this to be vintage King.	2002-12-01

This is the story of Gaia, who isn't afraid of anything. How is this you ask? Well, Gaia was born without the fear gene. She's afraid of nothing.<br />As I said the book has a lot of pontential. Perhaps in the hands of a more skillfull writer this book would have been a bit better.  The author's writing style is one of an amature. She changes the font of the writing for no reason, and she also changes the type face for no reason.<br />There is one thing that I really liked about this book. That's the characterazation of Gaia.  The author has the gift of making us care about Gaia, and tell the troubles of a girl her age.<br />If you want to read this book, go ahead. This isn't a bad book, but I felt much more could have been done.	2002-11-25

Alex Cross has his hands full with these murders, but his plate will get fuller. Two killers are killing famous people in the Washington area.

Cross soon learns the truth behind Jack and Jill, and who thier target really is. Can Cross burn the candles at both ends as he tries to solve the murder of kids, *and* try to stop Jack and Jill?<br />Patterson is an amazing writer. He has wonderful characters that you have to read about and you want to read about.  The bad guys are so interesting, that you want to read more about them. You can't believe the things that they do, but yet, you want to read more about them. Patterson keeps the reader glued to the page with outstanding plot twists.<br />If you haven't started this series, you have to. This is the third book in it, and they keep getting better and better.

Over all it's a pretty good book. This is the story of a man who's turned into a vampire and he's hunting the woman to turned him.  The problem is that this didnt' have to be a vampire book. It feels that the author wanted to write a book about a man seaching for someone, and the vampire aspect was just an after thought.<br />The characters are pretty good. Mikaelian is a detective and is a beliveable chatacter. Lane Barber is a vampire and her character is good too.<br />The writing style was pretty good too, it just that I was expecting more form the vampire perspective. More killings, and more violence.<br />Over all it was a pretty good read. If you like vampire books, consider this vampire lite.	2002-10-15

I love Buffy books, and when I read the back cover to this book, I was really excited to read it. When I was done, I felt that something was missing. Perhaps it could have used more plot twists.<br /> On night when Buffy was on patrol, she comes across some demons, and to Buffy's suprise, she sees a girl that could handle herself aganist demons. The next day, Dawn befriends a girl that's picked on. Dawn quickly becomes her friend, but wonders why she won't stand up to those who are picking on her.  Dawn brings the girl homes, and to Buffy's suprise, the girl that Dawn brought home is the same girl that could hold her own aganist demons. Buffy and the scooby gang set out to find out who this mysterious stranger is. When they find out who she is.....will any of them be safe. This is the coming of age for a demon.<br />The style of writing is okay. I feel it could have used a bit more of a plot twist.<br />Over is it was okay. If you're a Buffy fan, go ahead and read it.

This is the first book I read by Iles, and I plan to get the rest of his books. Iles is a fantastic author. He has the ability to keep the reader hooked to the very last page. He writing style is one of many plot twists and outsandting characters that you want to read about, and care about, even the &quot;bad guys&quot;.<br />This is the story of the Jennings family. They are forced to live a parents worst nightmare, the kidnapping of their child. But they aren't going to sit back and be a victim. They fight back to get their daughter. While this is going on, someone else is also helping the Jennings family, even if they don't know it. Hickey, who plays a role in the kidnapping, tells Karen that he has kidnapped her daughter, she won't be harmed. He's done this before and the child has always walked away. But something about this kidnapping is much different, Hickey isn't really interesting in moeny. What could he be interesetd in? Read this book and find out.

Goingbacks a talented writer that knows how to tap into horror and scare the bejesus out of you.<br />Michael Anthony is a horror writer and he's going back to here he grew up. He likes it there, but not everyone wants him back. the townspeople think he's cursed. Why? His grandma was knows as the town loon. She was known to shoot holes in the walls and call the police b/c she sees shadows. But maybe she wasn't that crazy. Mike and his familty move into his Grandama's house...soon, Mike and his family will learn what true terror is...and try to find help in a town that doesn't want him.<br />I like how Goingback has a lot of Native American culture in his books. If you dont' know a lot about the Native American culture (like me) he bring it down to a basic level. <br />This book is well written, has wonderful plot twists, on the edge of your seat horror, and wodnderful characters that you want to know more aobut.

Those of you who have read past Buffy books, by her know what I mean. The Evil that Men Do is pleasure to read. Holder has a solid grasp of the character, dialougs, and the actions of the characters of the show. This is obvious in her writing.<br />What could lead to a shooting spree in Sunnydale? Could it be some random act or are some demons at work? While Buffy is figureing this out, other acts of violence is happing in Sunnydale. This sounds like a job for the Scooby gang...just one problem, Willow turns on Buffy and refuses to help. And if this isn't enough for Buffy....a ancient creature is hunting Buffy. Why would Willow turn of Buffy and what's hunting Buffy? Read this book and find out. (Dont' worry,I didn't ruin any of the plot, this is all on the back cover.)<br />Hodler has a wonderful style of writing that will keep the reader glued to the book.

It just seemed to me missing something. <br />The story is of a witch, Willow, that goes into the swamp, and a evil force keeps her there. It's up to her mother and sisters, who are witches, to use their magic to get Willow back.  That's a pretty small summary, but that's basically, what it's about.<br />The characters are pretty interesting. I love the character of Willow.She adds so much to this story, I'd like to have had the chance to get to know her more, and know more about her. The rest of the characters seem flat and uninteresting. It's just that something was missing.<br />I do like how Gresham showed the connection between the wicca religion and nature. That was a powerful part of the book. I also liked how he went over the rules for Witchcraft and the difference between Black and White magic.<br />If you see this book at a usedbook store or a library sale...then go ahead and get it, but I wouldn't suggest that you pay full price for it.	2002-09-11

The characters were pretty good, they had some good depth to them.  The writing style by O'Brien was pretty good. A coulpe of nice plot twists. But overall, I was wanting a little bit more. We never know why the killer does what he does. We're not given any motivation for the killers actions. What drives him to do what he did.<br />There's a killer lose in Seattle. His first 3 victims are a younge judge, a waitress, and a college student. They come from all walks of life, but yet, they all have one common element. That one single element makes them perfect for the killer. The problem is, he's not done. The killer has a mission, and nothing will stop him from creating his personal masterpiece of horror.

The murders are very orginal. Once you find out what the killer's movtives are, you'll be blown away. I know I was.<BR>         I just had one -small- problem with this book.  To me, a serial killer book needs to have contact with the police.  He or she needs to be taunting the police. A good example of this is the first few books to John Sanford's \\"Prey\\" series. To me, that's what drives a serial killer book.<BR>        Now that being said, if you start this book, I don't think you'll be sorry.

Now that he's out, he wants to find the ones who set him up for murder and was forced to do unspeakable things in jail. But now Growler is out, and it's times to make the giulty pay.<BR>        Don't think that that the above spoils anything. What I said is mention in the back of the book. I left out a lot, trust me.<BR>        Martin gives the reader many chills with the unique murders that Growler commits.  Martin also has the ability to keep the reader glued to the page, and actually forced the reader to put the book down.  This book has a lot of plot twiwts and excellent characters that will heep the reader hooked to the very last page.<BR>       If you know of Martin's works, then you need to get this book, and other book Mratin wrote. Now, if you haven't read any books my Martin, then you must start it. You may want to read a book called \\"Lie to Me\\", before you read this book. One character in Lie to me, shows up here.  Start this book, you won't be sorry.	2002-08-20
US	51266167	R2BFWA6RVLDOT9	0446603503	340203026	Superstitious	Books	3	0	0	N	N	A Pretty good read.	This is Stine's first attempt to write an adult (non Goosebumps) book. Over all, he did a pretty good job. It's obvious that Stine took the time to research the many superstitions and what they mean, and how to fight them off. The problem is that there's almost to many supersitions that are covererd. I found myself annoyed at times reading about them. I wanted the story to move along.<br />Sara is involved with a professor that takes superstitions very seriously. Sara is then swept up with the prof and his sister and all of superstitoins and rituals that they go throught. As if this isn't enough for Sara to deal with...there's savage, brutal killer on the college campus that targets women. And what this killer is savage and violent. Sara is soon trapped in the world of superstitions, in which she can't excape.<br />Over all this is a pretty good book. This is also a very violent and a gore filled book. Over all if you like horror and like Stine, then I suggest this book. Is this a fantastic book? No. Is this a decent book? Yup.  If you like gore, then you may like this book.	2002-08-12

I do plan to get more of Clark's books.<br />What would happen if you woke up one day and one of two things happened. You're over 19, and you killed your kids and are after other kids. You are infact a zombie. Or on the otherside, you're under 19, and you were lucky enough to live the mass murder, and you have to fight the army of zombies.  <br />Meet Steve Aten (and that rimes with Satan). He comes back home ond day and his world has changed. His parents missing, and his brother dead. Soon he finds himself in the middle of an apocalyptic nightmare. He and a band of survivors must fight the zobmies. They have to put aside their differences (and that's not easy) and make a stand agasnit the zombies. <br />That's all I want to say about the plot. I don't want to give more away. If you like horror filled with blood, gore, and more blood, then this is a books for you. If you start Blood Crazy, you won't be sorry.	2002-08-12

Who know, but this is a pretty good read. Some parts were pretty scary, for example, the figure at the top of the stairs. Other parts seemed to drag a small bit. Sometimes that parts that dragged for me was in the way the author told the story. Perhaps an experienced author could have given more atmosphere to the story.<br />  This is the story of the Lutzs and their experience in the haunted house the bought. Then 28 days later, they fled in terror, leaving most of their possessions. In this book, the reader will find out what made the Lutz's flee.<br />It all started when the priest went to bless the house and a voice said \\"GET OUT!\\" From that point time, the Lutz's lived in terror and nobody in that house was safe. Even the Priest that helped them was victim to the demonic forces that infested the house.  The Lutz's went through a lot of horrific events before they left the house. Much more than I would have put up with. Even when the moved, the demonic forces followed them for a while.<br />The only problem I had with this book is the end. I wont' way what happened, but the way it ended....didnt' seem like a fit ending. There was more to tell and the author didn't tell it. I don't want to say the end was a let down, because it wasn't. However from the way it ended, it just wasn't a good place to end the story.<br />If you like true life ghost stories, then you need to read this book. Is it true? Who know, but it's a good story. If you start it, I don't think you'll be sorry.	2002-07-27

I've loved everyone of his books, and Among the missing is no exception.<br />This starts off with a woman driving down a road in a jag and a very skimpy nightgown. She picks up a man and he suggests that they go to the beach and spend the night. He tells her it's going to be romantic. Wen the sun comes up, there's going to be a body, and more will me missing then the woman's clothes. A killer is on  the lose, and he plans to kill more. This can be found out on the back cover, so nothing was spoiled.<br />This has your typical Laymon elements that are found in his books. Great characters (Merton was one sick puppy), woderful, and I mean, wonderful plot twists, horny characters, and lots of gore.<br />If you're a fan of Laymon, then you know his writing style, and you'll want to read this book. If you haven't read Laymon, then treat yourself to this good book. Laymon has also written The Traveling Vampire Show, In the Dark, and Island. All of this books are a fun read and you can't go wrong.	2002-07-27
US	51266167	RTP8G0KH0MYKI	0843949783	372932416	Island	Books	5	42	43	N	N	Laymon does it again!	I've read about 5 of Laymon's books and I loved them all. Island is no exception. I LOVED this book. The world lost a literary great when Laymon passed away. <br />Rupert Conway is the teller of this story. He's thought that when his girlfriend asked him to come on a family vacation, he'd have a time of his life, an adventure he'd never forget. He was right about that. After the boat explodes, the girl's family and Rupert swim to an island. There's plenty of fresh water and food...and a killer. The killer plans to kill off one by one so the killer can  put his sick and twisted plan into action.<br />Laymon is such a talented writer. He had the ability to keep the reader glued to the page with many plot twists and turns. Many times I'd tell myself that I'd just read to the end of the chapter, then go to bed. Well, that didnt' work. I read this 504 page book in just two days. I dare anyone to start this book and try to put it down. Guess what, ya can't. <br />Laymon also can create characters you care about and want to read about. Laymon created wonderful characters in Rupert and Connie. What's typical in Laymon's writing, is that you even care about the chatacters that are bad. The reader will want to get to know all of them, want to know everything about them.<br />I know people who like to skim through a book to get the \\"feel\\" of it. Don't do this with that book. If you do, you may run into spoilers and ruin the book.<br />I can't say enought good things about this book. If you start it, I know you'll love it. You won't be sorry.	2002-07-19

When I saw the cover at a used bookstore, I had to buy it. I loved the cover. That's about all I loved about this book. &quot;The House of Caine&quot; would have made a better short story. This book is 501 pages, it's about 480 pages to long. This would have made a much better short story. Heck, the vampire isn't really mentioned until about page 400. And this is a vampire novel?? One problem that the reader will face is that most is the book isn't nessessary to read. So much space (and time the reader gives this book) is wasted.<br />Here's the &quot;plot&quot;.Robert Martin comes back home, only to find out that he isn't welcome. His family has a secret that everyone knows about (but Robert) but never really mentions until the end of the book. Robert has to interview Robert Kennedy. He stops over in the town where he grew up, &quot;just passing through.&quot; Here his friend who he's traveling with, is missing. Robert has to solve the mystery of his friend, and face the sins of his family.  When he does this, it leads him to a vampire. Like I said, this would have been a wonderful short story.<br />The &quot;plot&quot; with RFK has nothing to do with the story. For that matter, most of the book has nothing to do with the plot. Eulo seems to make a lot of references to Vietman...but it has nothing to do do with the &quot;plot&quot;. A lot of space is used for this book, and not a lot is being said.<br />Take my advise...don't read this book. It's not really worth it. I kept on saying to myself that &quot;this has to get better&quot;, well, it doesen't. Normally I saw that when I read a book that I dont' really like, get it at a used bookstore, so you won't pay so much. In the case of &quot;The House of Caine&quot;, dont' even look for it at a used bookstore. If I could, I'd given this 0 stars.	2002-07-19

First, before I get to my review of the book, I read that this is to be compared to Harry Potter. Wrong! The Harry Potter is the best series that child can read.<br />Now on with the review. What a good book. My cousin bought it for me for my b-day to use in the classroom. There is some profanity so I can't use it in the classroom...but I did enjoy the book.<br />Meet Artemis Fowl. He's a criminal mastermind. Highly intelligent, very cunning....and just 12 years old! He knows that there is fariy gold to be found, but he has to figure out how to get it. He kidnaps a fairy and holds her hostage. But this isn't a usual fairy. Why not? Read and find out.<br />Colfer has created a world where this world and the fairy world meet. There's a lot of magic and fairy power to hold the readers attention and has characters that we, as the reader, care about and want to get to know.  Fowl is a genius and it's interesting how Colfer has created him. I highly suggest this book (parents: there is some profanity and some light violence) and I can't wait to read the next book in the series.	2002-07-12

This is one reader that Snicket has hooked.<br />Meet the Baudelaire orphans (Violet, Klaus and Sunny) they are the children who have a bad beginning. They find out that their parents have died, and then are forced to live with their strange, scary, and greedy Count that wants all of their money. When the children are with him, they have to do all sorts of work, and sleep in terrible conditions. Hence, it's a bad beginning....and it doesn't get much better. The Count wants to steal all their money. I won't say anything more about the plot, because I dont' want to ruin it.<br />Snicket has a wonderful sence of humor. It comes through in his unique style of writing that keeps the reader glued to the page. The characters are ones that the reader cares about and wants to know more about them.<br /> All of the kids in the class I student taught in begged me to read it. I was glad I did. this is a wonderful read. When the kids complained abbout something, I said that they should be glad that they aren't the  Baudelaire orphans.<br />If you start this series, you won't be sorry.	2002-07-12

I was very pleased on how good this book was.<br />In the mid 1860's a chruch was built for the Reverend Wendall McFall. His sermons were about God's other Son. He was going to undo all of the work that Jesus did. But for this to happen, a sacrifice was needed. A sacrifice had to be a child. When he did this, the towns people hanged him. They thought that it was going to be the end....it was just the beginning. Then in present day someone comes and claims that he's God's other son, then the murders start. Are they the work of this &quot;other son&quot; or are they the work of a creature that haunts the church. And who is this creature. Read the book and find the answers<br />Nicholas has a powerful style of writing. He has the abablity to keep the read glued to the page. The characters are life like, you help to want to get to know them.<br />If you love horror, then you have to start this book. You won't be sorry.	2002-07-10

In the final chapter of the Union series, Bond comes face to face with the mastermind of the Union.<br />If you're a James Bond fan, then you have to start the series. The first one is High Time To Kill, Doubleshot, then Never Dream of Dying.<br />This series starts off with a raid that goes bad...horrible bad. After this happens, Bond vows to take them down no matter what the cost. I can't say to much about the plot, but I will say this...someone from Bond's past comes back...and this was a shocker. By the end of the book, Bond comes up aganist the mastermind of the Union...a blind man who has unusual sight. <br />Benson has a strong style of writing. It's obvious he has a stonge knowledge of the Bond character and what makes him tick. If you start the series, you won't be sorry.	2002-06-25

I honestly wasn't sure how I'd like this, because I thought it was just going to be your typical \\"I turned into a vampire\\" book\\"...boy was I wrong!<br />Meet Cassandra. She works at a store putting up window displays. Her life was borning and she felt it was at a stand still. Until she met Jullian. He changed her life...or her unlife. She was turned into a vampire.....and not in your usual way. You'll have to read it and see how it was done. Now she has two different groups that are after her. One is a religious team of slayers, and other is something straight out of hell to kill Cassie.  As you read the book, you'll learn of her life, and to see how she changed. <br />The only small thing that the reader has to be aware of. From chapter to chapter it goes from the past to the present. At times, I fould that annoying, but it's still a good read.<br />This books isn't for the faint of heart. There is grapic details of sex and S&M. Dont't get me wrong, it's not full of it, but it is there.<br />If you love reading vampire novels as much as I do,then you need to pick this book up, you won't be sorry.	2002-06-25

My guess is that perhaps there was a shortage of quality book. This book is painfuly bad.<br />I'm doing my thesis on the Revolutionary War at the Elementary level, and I was told I should read this book.  Thre are so many other books that are so much better. If you want to read about the Revolutionary War, then I suggest some Dear America books, and My name is America books, and MY Brother Sam is Dead.<br />The problem with Johnny Termain is that the war isn't mentioned until 1/2 of the book is over. The author just prattles on about nothing. It briefly mentions the Boston Masscure, and the Boston Tea Party. They are two events that are reasons why we went to war, but the author just skips over them.<br />As a character, Johnny is a smart mouthed little punk. The reader never really cares about what happens to him. In the story, Johnny gets injured on his silversmith job, and has to find other work. The problem is that we don't read that much about the war, and that's what this book is suppose to be about.<br />There are a lot of fictional books that are a good read that deal with the Revolutionary War.....Johnny Termain isn't one of them.	2002-06-20

This book is so much better than the movie, and the movie is awesome! What makes this book so good is that we get into the head of the characters. We get to know what they are thinking and feeling. This book also has &quot;extra&quot; scenes that add so much to this book.  For example, in the movie, MJ doesn't get an acting job. Well, in the book you find out why she doesn't get it.  I also liked how Peter wrote t his parents in his journals. The reader will also get to know Peter as a child, and find out what happened to Peter's parents.<br />If you're a fan of Peter David, then you have to get this book. His style of writing lets the characters come to life and we care about all of them, even they bad guys.<br />If you liked the movie, then you need to read this book.

Salinger has a way of writing that brings the characters to life, and what's more, is that they're characters that we care about, and want to read about.  The reader can't help to identify with most of the characters.<br />One of the characters that we can all identify with is the main character, Holden Caufield. As the reader, we're able to get have the treat of spending two or three days with him. We see how negative he is, but yet we wish him the best of luck. Why's what do you ask? It's simple....we can see some of ourself in Holden. We can't help to care about him, b/c he's us. Maybe we're not as negative as Holden, but at times, we're him. We're him b/c he's an honest character. Holden could be our neighbor, a family member, or  a friend. That's how strong of a writer Salinger is. He has the power to hold us to the page. We want to see what Holden's going to do next.<br />We see Holden getting kicked out of school and spend the next two days with him, and are able to look at his life. I like the ending b/c it makes you think.<br />I highly suggest this book.  Once you start, I promise you won't be sorry.	2002-06-06

Yup, I do rememeber the good ole days...when Lucas would beat the hell out of a suspect, make threats, and have a nice cat and mouse chase with the killer....the good ole days. Remember Eyes of Prey, Silent Prey and Mind Prey? Ahhhh....those were the classics. Mortal Prey isn't one of them...the classics.<br />Carla Rinker is back (from Certian prey). Her boyfriend is killed, a bullet that was meant for her, and her baby that she was pregnant with was killed. Rinker's out for revenge. She plans to kill all those who had a hand in her boyfriend's and her unborn babys death. This isn't spoiling anything, this is from the inside of the dust jacket.<br />You may ask...what's the problem? Well, the characters are. You just dont' care about them. Not even Lucas. Here's a guy that'd beat the hell out of a suspect and not think twice about it. In  Mortal Prey...nothing. Not even slap for old times sake. What else doesn't work is there's no cat and mouse chase between Rinker and Lucas. She just calls him a couple of times on his cell phone. Big Deal.<br />For the past few Prey books, I was really excited about getting them, only to be let down. I don't think I'll be getting any more hard backs of the Prey series. They just aren't what they used to be.<br />I hope that Stanford get back to the Lucas that we know and love in his next Prey book.	2002-06-06

Jane wishes something happened.  Jane should be careful what she wishes for....One day, she finds an envelope on her chair with a 50 dollar bill in it, with instructions. Jane's life has now changned. Why?  Beacuse Master of the Game (MOG) is in her life. Now MOG is making Jane play his game, but the prices starts getting high....really high. Because of MOG (as Sherlock Holmes would say) \\"The Games afoot.....\\"<br />Laymon is a very talented writer. He had the ability to keep the reader glued to the page with his unique style of writing.  He makes characters that the reader can't help to care about. The reader feels the same emotions that Jane feels. This book has plot twists all over the place that will keep the reader engaged to the very last page. I read this book in two days. I just put it down to get some sleep, and sometimes, not even then.<br />I urge you to read this book. I know you'll love Laymon's style of writing.

I read two of his books (reading a 3rd now) and I've loved all of his work.<br />Bite has been called a vampire book...well...it's vampire lite. There's not a vampire all through it, but he \\"drives\\" the story. Here's a short summary. Cat and Sam are out to kill a vampire. That's the easy part. They spend the rest of the book trying to deal with the choices they've made.<br />The characters Sam and Cat meet in the desert are interesting. Trust me, that's an understatement.  All of the characers are complex and you can't help but to care for them, the good and the bad ones. <br />Bite has so many plot twists and Laymon had such a nice writing style, it [pulls] the reader in, and won't let go.  Laymon has such a refershing style, that he keeps the reader glued to the page.<br />The literary world will miss Richard Laymon. He's a writer that had a speical gift.

As I said, above, I did expect better. After reading the back of the book, I had such high hopes.<br />Here's a quick summary. There's a new vampire in town, and she has the strength and the speed of the slayer. And she wants one thing...to kill Buffy. Who is this new vampire and why does she want to kill Buffy? You'll have to read it to find out. The reader will also find out what secret that this vampire has. That's all I want to say about the plot. Whoever wrote the blurb on the back cover should be shot. They gave a *major* spoiler away. Even some of the people who have reviewed on Amazon, gave that secret away. Shame on them.  Read the book and discover the secret for yourself.<br />The sub plot with Ayna to me seemed forced, and didn't really fit in with the story.<br />One of the strenghts the Navarro has is that she takes us in the mind of the characters, and does a wonderful job. Esp with Anya. As I said, the plot with here didn't really fit, but I like how we get into Anya's thoughts and see some of her feelings.<br />Navarro has a short story in \\"Tales of the Slayers\\". I *highly* suggest that all of you get that book, just to read her story. It's amazing!<br />Over all, this was a pretty good Buffy book. I read better and I've read worse.  If you want to try it, go for it. It's a pretty good read.	2002-04-14

This is an outstanding book!  <br />Amanda Pearce comes to work at a hotel. Little does she know that she's in the middle of a feud. Now, this is no normal fued, oh no. This is a feud between two families that are vampires. Someone plays \\"joke\\" on Amanda then she's sucked into the middle, with no way out. She has to figure who she can trust, and who she can't.  This  is a short summary of the books. If I say more, I'll be giving things away, and I don't want to do that to the read.<br />The characters that Tamara creates are incredible, just incredible. My two favorites are Costal Eddie (he has a pretty small part, but I loved him) and The Twins. I **loved** The Twins, they're a complete riot. If you love vampire fiction, you have got to love The Twins.<br />Tamara's writing styly will keep the reader glued to the page. She does this with wonderful plot twists, crisp dialouge, and characters that you just can't help to care about. The good guys, are good, and you have to love the bad guys.<br />If you like your fiction in the vampire relm, then you have to run, not walk to your nearest bookseller and get your hands on a copy of this book.

Shoot, this is from the back of the book.  I found it down right funny at times on how the agents protected the last family.<br />This was an OK read. I thought that Paul snapped out of his depression a bit to fast, and some of the things that the killer did was at times far fetched. None the less, this was an OK read. I suggest you look for it at libraries or a used book store.<br />If you want to read some good books about a cop after a killer, I highly suggest you start reading the Prey series by John Sandford. That series starts with Rules of Prey. My favorites are Mind Prey, Eyes of Prey, Silent Prey.<br />If you read The Last Family, you'll probally find parts of it you liked.	2002-04-10

Picture if you will, Stephen King teaching kindergardeners the ABC's, that all you need to know about this oh so funny book. It's dark, disturbing, twisted, and a wonderful read. In today world, everything has to be &quot;PC&quot;, well Gorey's book is a breath of fresh air. I was actually laughing outloud as I was reading the book. Once you pick it up, you'll have a lot of chuckles. This is the first book I read by Gorey, and I plan to get the rest of his books. He's that good.	2002-04-05

I do plan to go into search mode for the rest of his books. Blood Kin is a pretty good read.<br />Josiah Craven was killed a century ago and was buried in an unmarked grave....until today. One of Josiah's kin pulls out the stake, and Josiah is back in action. He has plans for this family, and anyone who crosses him. Don't worry, this isn't giving anything away, this is from the back of the book.<br />The characters in the book were very good and realistic.  You can't help but to care for them, and feel a wide range of emotions for them. Kelly has a wonderful writing style that will keep the reader hooked to each page.<br />Over all this was a good read. I just had one small problem. I didn't know why Grand Pappy did what he did. I mean, I what he was doing, but I never understood why, he was doing it.<br />I love vampire books and read a lot of them. Mind you this isn't the best one I read, or the worse one.

First off, if you are sick of the Anne Rice vampires who have a cheesy accent, and whine and complain about the \\"dark gift\\" of being a vampire, then this book is for you.  The vampire in this book is anything but whiny.  However, if you like your vampire books with a ruthless vampire that kills without compassion, morals, or even a second thought, then this book is for you.  <br />Skipp and Spector have a very strong writing style.  Strong in that this is a real page turner filled with violence and gore around every turn. For example, just wait till you read what happens in a movie theater.<br />This book is pretty much out of print. I was lucky enough to find my copy at a used bookstore. I urge you to go out and hunt for this book. I can promise you that you won't be sorry.<br />If you like your vampires to kill without reason, then you have to start this book. You'll love every page. That I can promise you.	2002-03-11

I tried to read this book twice...and had to put it down within the first 100 pages both times. It seems that there are a lot of wasted characters. What's the point?! The only thing I can think of is they are introduced in this book, and they will apprear later in the series, or in another one. I was also sick of people  bellyaching about how Lestate wrote a book about the &quot;secrets of the vampire ways&quot; and his songs are &quot;dangerous for humans to know their ways.&quot; Okay, we get it, some vampies are peeved b/c of what  Lestate did...does every character have to moan about it?

When I heard that there was going to be another Anita Blake book, I was very excited. I mean, who can resist Anita? Well, feel free to resist this book. It's pretty bad. There is just so much wrong with it.<br />One of the things that bothered me the most was the lack of a plot. Anita wasn't going aganist a vampire, ghost, goulie, zombie or witch. This is just about Anita dealing with her change.  She' not human, werewolf, or vampire. Antia's something new, something that we've never seen. Anita could have done her &quot;selfexploring&quot; but have some sort of plot with it.<br />Richard is annoying as usual. I can't stand him, never could. He seems to want the best of both worlds, but he can't have it. In the past, he's said at times he wants to be a wolf, and at times he doesen't. Well pick one, that's what I say. To me Richard was one of the reasons why I disliked this book so much.<br />If you get offended by sex, then you best skip NIC. It's pretty heavy on the sex (more so then in past books) and Anita does some  interesting things...she did somethings that I did't expect she ever would do.<br />If you like the series, then I suggest that you wait for the paperback to come out. Either that, or get it from the library or a used bookstore.  I don't think it's worth the hardcover price. I hope the next book is better.	2002-01-06

Outstanding! This is the story of a little girl who wants to go to school, but she doesn't have a coat. Her mom and some of her friends make a coat out of rags. When she wears this beautiful looking coat (and it is beautiful coat) to school, her classmates make fun of her and the coat. She runs off to the woods in tears. She remembers the words of her father who died. Minna then went back to the class and explained that this coat, just wansn't rags.  The &quot;rags&quot; came from the childhood of the kids in the class. An old blanket here, an old coat there. They soon realize that each part of the rag coat, has a story to it.<br />This is a wonderful way to show a classroom that they are a community, and a part of each other. If you're a teacher, or someone who volunteers time in your childs class, or a student teacher, go out and get this book for your class. The kids will ove it. <br />For a project, (and if you know someone that can sew) each child can bring in a &quot;rag&quot; and make a class &quot;rag coat&quot;	2001-12-21

One of his school friends is back in town (Peter Tummelier), and soon Roscoe's enemies start turing up dead. Not just one's in Roscoe's present, but his enemies that were in his childhood.  Peter has plans for Roscoe and his family.<br />Through the book we meet a lot of interesting and creepy characters.  Most of the creepiness comes in when we meet Peter and his brother. Not only do we read about what Peter and his Brother do in the present, but we also read the sick and twisted childhood that they had. When you read about the childhood that peter and his brother had, you start to feel sorry for them on how they turned out as adults. But you will get the heebie-jeebies when you read this wonderful book.<br />This is one of the most interesting vampire books that I've read. You don't know if there is a vampire or just some serial killer.  I can promise you that you'll be guessing right up to the end.<br />Martin has a wonderful writing style. He has the talent to mix in horror and humor in this story. The characters seem life like, and one can't help but to feel a range of emotions as they read.

I had hard time putting it down.<br />Meghann had a good life, good family, great friends, and a man she planed to marry...then she met Simon, and that changed her life forever. Simon's a vampire, and a very ruthless and violent one at that. He saw Meghann, and he was going to have her. Nothing was going to stop him. Depending on his mood, he could give Meghann pain or pleasure. Then one day, Megahnn had enought and put a stake through his heart and left him on the roof as the sun was coming up. (This isn't giving anythng away, it's onthe back cover). She thought she killed him...she was wrong. Now Simon is going to have Meghann again, and kill everyone and anyone who get's in his way.<br />One of the most powerful things that struck me in this book is how Meghann changed. From the submissive fragile vampire Simon had made her into, to the confidiant vampire she became. Megahann soon found courage that she never knew she had. The servant has turned into the master.<br />One of the things I liked the most is the character of Simon. I'm kind of tired of how some vampie books have the vampire as the good guy and is ashamed of their vampire part...well, it's not the case in this book.  Simon is a very violent and cruel vampire that *loves* his vampire side. If you like your vampies nasty, and will kill someone violently, then this book if for you. I can't say enough good things about this book.<br />There is just two *small* things that keep me from giving this a 5 star rating.  The first is the use of dates. The reader go on a journey through the present and the past as we learn about Meghann's life. After a while I was a lil lost to where the story was taking place. The other thing that keeps it from a 5 rating is the ending. That's all I'll say b/c I dont' want to ruin it for anyone.<br />Baker has a fantastic writing style. She has the talent to make the char's life like and you can't help to care about them.  The reader will be glued to the book to see what acts of violence Simon plan to do. He's one sick puppy, and I loved every minute of it.<br />If you like vampire books, and you like ruthless vampires and like to read about a vampire at its full vampiness, then you have to read Crimson Kiss. You won't be sorry, I know I wasn't.  <br />In the back of the book, it tells of the sequal...I'll be the frist in line to get it. It's that good.	2001-11-25

If you've read all of the books in The Vampire Legacy, they you need to pick this book up and continue the voyage. If you haven't started this series, then you need to do so now.<br />This chapter of the series, Vivienne is the main focus.  The reader will learn of her life, death, and her life as a vampire. Her loves, passions, and the reader will also learn of her heartaches.  The reader can't help but to feel a wide range of emotions as we read about Vivienne.<br />As the story opens, the reader is enjoying the life we are lucky enough to share with Viv. Then about 1/2 was through something happens...someone is killing the members of The Cadre (don't know what that is? Then you need to start from the first book and work your was through the series) and wants to kill the vampires. Wth the help of some old friends, Vivienne must somehow stop a creature that's not human, but at the same time, not a vampire....but something to the likes that Vivienne has never seen.<br />Karen Taylor dilevers a wonderful story, as usual.  Her characters are life like and you just can't help but to care about them. As the series goes on, you feel as if your seeing old friends. <br />Taylor's writing style keeps the reader glued to the book. The description she lays out for the reader is stunning. If you haven't read any of the series, I suggest you start with the first one, and enjoy the ride. I'm doing it now. <br />At the end of Vivienne, it says that there will be a new chapter in The Vampire Legacy coming out in the fall of 2001. I can't wait to see what happens next.	2001-10-28

All I can say about this series is WOW!! If you haven't read any of them yet, I highly suggest you get the first one and make your way through them. WOW!!!<br />In this 3rd installment, Buffy is trying to comes to terms and find out what she did wrong. What is wrong you say? Well, Sunnydale is overrun with vampires and they have a King....it's Giles. Buffy has made a mistake in the past and it has thrusted her in the furture, and her friends are different. Willow is a powerful witch, and Xander is much harder...much darker. Even Spike's a pawn...and Giles controls him.  Buffy has to figure out what went wrong, and correct her mistake...if she can. It's not as simple as that...Giles is toying with Buffy. He feels that she can't kill him. Is he right? Can't Buffy kill her one time Watcher and friend?  Like me, you'll have to wait to the end to find out what happens. Get the first book and enjoy the ride. I know I am.<br />The characters are incredible. Even through this isn't the &quot;universe&quot; that Buffy fans know, the characters are incredible. It's interesting to see how they turned out when Buffy isn't there for some time. Where was she? Read the series from the start, and find out.<br />The author has a fantastic writing style that will keep the reader glued to the page. When they are done reading one &quot;chapter&quot; to the book, the reader wants more. I know I do. I can't wait to see how everything turns out.  The dialoge in the book is just like the show. It's a bit different, but it's fresh, crisp and quick.<br />I can't say enough good things about this book. If your a Buffy fan, then you have to start this series.	2001-10-21

The characters are pretty good, some are better than others.<br />What this book boild down to is two powerful vampires who are hell bent on destroying each other.  The only way that they can do this is to use human as their pawns.  Each vampire had it's human servents to do their will. The final battle was incredible.<br />This book is violent and some of the chars are pretty dark, but what a thrilling ride. that being said, I feel there is just one small drawback, there's a lot of build up. But other that that, I suggest that you buy this book. I doubt that you'll be sorry.<br />Siciliano has a good writing style that will keep the reader engaged.	2001-10-21

If you are a fan of the Anita Blake books, then this is a must for you. All fans of Anita are familar with Edward. We never knew much about him...well now that's changed. This is Edwards story. Don't get me wrong, Anita sill tells the story, but we finally get to read Edward's story.<br />Anita killed one of Edward's back up, and now she owes Edward a favor...and in Obsidian Butterfly, Edward collects on that favor.<br />We all know that Edward's smart as a tack and twice as tough as a nail.  So what kind of monster could be out there that's scares him? You'll have to read this book to find out what's lurking in the darkness.<br />As usual, the characters in this book are life like. I liked the char of Olf and Bernardo. I highly expect to see these characters in furture books....esp Olf.<br />When it comes to Anita and Edward I'd like to see one of two things happen. They either hook up or in one book they go aganst each other to see who's the best.<br />Hamilton has a very unique writing styly that keeps the reader glued to the page.  The dialouge is sharp, witty, and just fun to read.<br />I *highly* suggest this book. If you have to, get Guilty Pleasures (the first book) and work you way up to Obsidian Butterfly, you won't be sorry.	2001-09-15

As if this wasn't bad enough, some vamps come to town that dont' act like normal vamps. (I can't say how, b/c I dont' want to ruin anything. To make matters worse (this is from the back cover) a deceased slayer Lucy Hanover, comes to Buffy to warn her about a danger...<br />One of the strongest parts of this book is that Golden has a strong grasp of the char of Buffy and the slayeretts.  The reader can actually hear the char speak the lines, it's that realastic. <br />I also like how the reader gets into the head of Buffy and the other char to see why they act they way they do. The reader will actally feel sympathy for the char.  It shows how much everyone cares for each other.<br />If yer a Buffy fan, then you need to start this fantastic series.

I can't say to much about this book b/c i dont' want to ruin anything. Just trust me, if you've read the first books, then you need to read the second. <br />What I liked about the alternative universe that Buffy is in, is that it has the char from Buffy's reality, but they just aren't the same.  That's all I'm going to say, I can't give out to much. The end was incredible!! I can't wait for pt. 3.<br />I highly suggest this series.

We learn about his early life and see him &quot;meet&quot; a &quot;vampire&quot; that's in the ground.  Time passes and Dragonansi is older and comes back to the &quot;vampire in the ground&quot;.<br />For me, the writing isn't that great.

Brooks has a writing style that will keep the reader glued to each page. This is one of the first books that I actually lost sleep over. I just  *had* to read one more chapter. Then at the end of a chapter, there was a plot twist that had me and refused to let go.  You may want to get sleeping pills with this book, so you'll be forced to sleep.<br />You won't miss this book if yer looking for it. It's has an arrtactive woman bound by the writst in a erotic way.  The book caught my eye, the I was talking about it with a friend, and she said that I *had* to buy it, I wouln't be sorry. How right she was.<br />One char I really liked was Detective Rubin. What a wonderful character.  He adds a lot to a book that has a lot.<br />Okay, I said enought. Go out and get Darkness Bound.

No moden weapons of today can destroy the Crota.  It's up to Skip, a local sheriff and a Natiave American, Jay Little Hawk to use the Navative American ancestory to defeat the Crota.<br />Goingback is a fantastic writer. The characters he has created seem real and not flat the way some writers are. His writing style is one that's easy to read. The reader won't get lost in long paragraphs and longer description.  Goingback get's right to the point.<br />I liked how Goingback used his Natative American history to bring the reader in to the nataive American world and legend.  The book it'self was pretty violent, but I couldn't put down.  It was that good. <br />This is the first book I read by Goingback,and I plan to read the rest of his books.

For Four years he's suffered from a writers block b/c he misses his wife so much.  He feels that he can't go on.  To get away from everything, he moves to his sumemr home in western Maine. He hopes to get back to his roots and maybe be albe to write again. In a strange turn of events, (I won't say what, you'll have to read it for yourself) he meets a child named Ki, and her mother Matie who's 19 and helps them with a problem....a very sersious one.  Soon Mike finds that some spirits are contacting him with the Magnets on his fridge in his summer home. In the process of helping Mattie and Ki, he also learns a secret about his dead wife, Jo.  That's all I really want to say about the plot. You need to read it for yourself.<br />When it comes to creating char, King's a genius.  The reader will find themselves caring about Mattie and Ki, and their heart will break as mine did by the end. I fell in love with mattie and Ki.   King wrote with the emotions and the language that a child would use.  It was very emotional and prowerful..and my heart broke...<br />The die hard King fans will see char's from other books and aspects from King's like in Bag of Bones. Even if the reader never picks up on them, they'll still be able to enjoy this book.<br />If you've never read King b/c you don't like horror, please read this book. It's not a true &quot;horro&quot; book.  This is a masterpiece.  Plain and simple. If you don't read this book, you will be missing out on a lot.  I urge you to run, and not walk to your local bookstore and get your hands on a copy.  I promise you won't be sorry.<br />Bag of Bones is a timeless classic....	2001-08-12

When I heard that there was a vampire/star trek novel, I had to find it.  This  has to be one of my least favorite Trek books.  If your looking for a vampire book.....this isn't is.  I have a feeling that J.M Dillard doesn't have a grasp on the vampire lore.<br />The plot is pretty straight forward. The Enterprise gets a medical emergency summons from the planet Tanis.  There Kirk and crew find one sole survivor who has a hunger for blood. The crew were quickly talking of the vampire.  I wont' say much more b/c I don't want to ruin the plot. But I did have some problems....<br />The person that was the &quot;vampire&quot; could only drink the blood of someone who has the same blood time as him....he has no vampire powers, and has to get the blood from his victims buy using a straight razor.<br />Dillard had a pretty good grasp of the char and their dialouge.  Bones seemes like a aolcholic, but that's just a small complaint.  I have a feeling that this is one of Dillard's early Star trek books.  I have read some fantastic ST books, by her, but this isn't one of them. I suggest that you read her later ones and skip this one.	2001-08-11

First off, how can you not like a vampire novel with the name of the author is Steakly. *LOL*.  You know it's going to be a good read.<br />Before I get started, I just wanted to say how bad the movie to this book is.  If you've seen the movie, and not sure if you want to read the book, I urge you to forget the horrid movie, and sit back and enjoy VAMPIRE$.<br />Meet Jack Crow.  Crow has a foul mouth, quick temper, liked his wiskey, and is a vampire hunter. He hunts vampires for money, a lot of it.  The reader will accompany Crow on a few slayings.  You'll meet his team and get to know the characters, and their background.  I really liked the char. Cat, what a hoot. He's adds a lot to this book.  What impressed me the most was they last slaying that the reader will read about. The Team has to come up aganist a master vampire...at night. Why you ask?  Read the book and find out.<br />Steakly has an amazing writing style. Through interesting plot twists, and fasntastic char the reader will be drawn in and will be fighting to put the book down.  Steakly's that good.<br />I highly suggest this book if you like vampire books, horror books, or likes to read a well crafted story by a talented author. If you start this book, you won't be sorry.	2001-08-09

This is a book for kids and adults with the hart of kids that never really grew up,and that qualifiles me. *LOL*<br />This book can be used to teach kids lessons that deal with Point of View of one character.  I plan to use use this book in my classroom when I start teaching.<br />I can't say enough good things about this book.  Scieszka is a fantasctic author. I have several of his books.

It's a pleasure to hear King read his own work, and to hear the auidence's feedback.  The story is about how a wife leaves her husband and leave's the cat, which she never liked.  I know the plot sounds simple, but in the hands of King, it's a wonderful read. There was times when I was actually laughing out loud.<br />It was interestig (and funny) how King points out how some animals bond to the to either their owners, and what the pets do to the owners they dont' like.<br />I highly suggest that you go out and join the rest of the Stephen King fans and buy this book on audio.	2001-08-04

For the longest time I was told to read this book, so I thought I'd give it a chance. I'm glad I did.<br />This is a story of how a simple man becomes a hero.  Meet Bilbo Baggins, a simple hobit who enjoys a simple life.  He's never had an adventure, and never wanted to go on one.  His life was changed when he met Gandalf, a great wizzard. Gandalf and his  troops wisk Biblo off on a great adventure in order to find treasures....and a adventure he'll never forget.  On his adventure, Biblo will come up aganist creature that nightmares are made from. In the process of his quest, he gets a ring of invisiblty.  My favorite part of the book is when Bilbo was drawn into a contest of riddles.  I also like the songs that the different people sang. It added so much to the book.<br />Tolkien is a genius, pure and simple. He has a very unique writing styly.  I look forward to reading The Lord of the Rings. I highly suggest you read this book.

I love reading vampire novels, and was told I should give it a try. Over all, it wasn't that bad.  I found it interesting that the word &quot;vampire&quot; is never used. If it was, it was done once and I missed it.<br />This is the story of Stefan, a vampire that wasn't to put his past behind him, and live a &quot;normal&quot; life as a vampire. He enrolls on school and meets Elena, who falls for Stefan.  Some murders happen and all (most all) of the finger pointing goes to Stefan.  Stefan has a darker and more evil Brother nanmed, Damon.  He too wasn't Elena. And will kill for her....<br />Over all it's a decent book. It's a YA book, so it's not heavy on teh vampire aspect.  Heck, the vampires could go out in the day. that was a bit over the top for me, but I enjoyed the book.<br />Smith has a writing style that can keep you hooked to the book. The char are well developed and the plot is interesting to read with a lot of nice twists.<br />take a chance, you may like it.	2001-07-15

It's called \\"High Time To Kill\\". Doubleshot leaves off where HTTK leaves off....<br />James Bond has hit the skids. He's drinking to much, and is slowly losing his sanity.  He feels that he must question his sanity b/c he has constant headaches, blackouts....and he just saw his double!  Could Bond be that close to the edege? Or is this a very detailed plot by The Union to discredit our favorite spy? I suggest you get this book and find out.<br />Benson is a fantastic writer b/c he has the power to keep the reader glued to the book.   If you're not a Bond fan, that's not a problem, b/c Benson has a way with word, and a [heck] of a plot.  Now, if you're a Bond fan, then hold on for a wild ride.  Everything we love about Bond, is in this book.  The chases, fights, and ofcourse...the women. At one point Bond is talking to  two women and tell them he works for a Import/Export company, \\"It's my job to make sure things go in and out smoothly.\\" *LMAO* Only Bond can say something like that, and get away with it.<br />Do yourself a favor and get Doubleshot.	2001-07-02

If you like vampire books, like I do, then there is no need to read this book. The plot (or lack there of) is very basic. Someone is killing vampires, and the main character (Sookie) and her boyfriend vampire (Bill) have to find who's doing the killing and why.<br />The Main character are very weak.Sookie is someone who can read minds, and falls in love with a vampire b/c she can't read his mind.  I found her char to be very limited and annoying.<br />Bill the vampire....what a weak vampire. Everything you can expect from a vampire, you won't find in Bill. Not only is he a &quot;good&quot; vampire, but also a very weak one.<br />The other thing that bothered me about this book is that the other vampires (even the &quot;bad&quot; ones) were not that bad. They did nothing that violent or &quot;vampiery&quot;.<br />I read that some of the reviewers compared this book to the likes of Laurall K. Hamilton....not in a long shot.  If you haven't read any of Hamilton book, start with Guilty Pleasures, and work your way through that series. You won't be sorry.<br />Only but this book if you see it at a used bookstore.<br />I expected so much from this book, and it just didn't deliver.	2001-06-29

This book is the first book in the &quot;The Union&quot; trilogy.<br />In this adventure, Bond finds himself on the icy slopes of the Himalays, in order to get back a secert that is important to the Military, and could help any country that goes to war.  The problem is that it was developed in England, and was stolen.  It's Bond's mission to get it back, and find who stole it.<br />One of the strenghts of this book is that Bond can't trust anyone b/c there's a double agent in MI5!  As bad as that is for Bond, there are more double agents, and more people he can't trust.<br />Raymond has a  solid writing style when it comes to his Bond books.  The reader will be hooked with every page. Just when there's a down time in the book, something else happens that picks up the pace. This is just incredible.<br />What really hit home for me was the last paragraph of this book. Bond takes a hard look at himself, and how he treats women.  I can't wait to get my hands on the other two books about The Union.<br />If you are a fan of 007, then you need to get into this triology. You won't be sorry.	2001-06-02

You have one serial killer called &quot;The Lover&quot;, who places a rose on his victims body.  Someone reads about it in the local paper, and he wanted to &quot;give hornors&quot; to the &quot;Lover&quot;, by being a Copycat killer. Just one problem, the Lover isn't flattered, he's mad.  Sounds like a *great* idead for a book, right?  Well somewhere alone the way, it falls apart.  I guess the biggest problem I had was how the &quot;Lover&quot; was caught.  There was very little cat and mouse play between Keough (the lead detective) and the Lover.<br />Randisi has a decent wrtiing style that will probally keep the reader hooked, but I feel that so much more coulde have been done with this book.<br />Don't get me wrong, this wasn't a bad read, I just expected a  bit more.	2001-06-02

Together, they try to levae the house, but one of them can't go.  That's all I'll say for the plot of the book, b/c I don't want to ruin anything.  I'll just say that I loved the char of Lulu.

After reading Easy Prey, I was ready to give up on the series, but I wanted to give Chosen Prey a chance. I'm glad I did. <br />This was a pretty good read. It just seems to be lacking something that was in the other \\"Prey\\" books.  There wasn't the cat and mouse game between Davenport and the killer. (A good example of what I'm talking about is Mind Prey and Eyes of Prey) It seems in the last two books, that Sandford is changing his writing style.  Mind you, it's not a bad change, but a change none the less.  That being said, it was good seeing Davenport in action.<br />James Qatar (saying his name isn't spoiling anything-you know who the killer is)  is an interesting villan.  He took pictures of women  and put their heads on [adult rated] pictures.  This obession went a step further, he then killed the women.  Davewnport is soon on the case, and is after Qatar.<br />The reader will be interested on how Stanford has a knowlegeable understanding of police proceedures, how they act,  and all the steps a police man would take in catching a bad guy.  He has done some indepth research.<br />Over all it was a pretty good read. You may want to wait until Chosen Prey comes out in paperback, or get it at a used bookstore. Dont' get me wrong, it's an interesting read, but not as interesting as some of the past Prey books.	2001-05-15

This book is what good fiction should be. Richard Laymon is a incerdible story teller.  This is the first book I've read by him, and plan to get the rest of his books.<br />This book is about a traveling vampire show that comes to town. Dwight, Slim and Rusty want to go in the worse way. The problem is that you have to be 18, no exceptions.  They get in and their lives are changed forever.  All 3 of them prove what true friendship is.  I can't say to much more on the plot, b/c I don't want to spoil anything.<br />The char of Slim, Rusty, and Dwight are just incredible.  The reader can't help but to care about them and what they do.  As you read about them, you can't help but to feel as if you're growing up with them, they're your friends too. You care about them. This shows you how powerful of a story teller Laymon is.<br />As good as the story is, it get's better when our trio enter the show...I was so wraped up in this book it was impossible to put down.<br />The Literary world lost a talented writer when Richard Laymon died. I can't express on how talent Mr. Laymon was. I *highly* urge all of you that are reading this to go out and do yourself a favor and buy this book. I promise you won't be sorry. <br />One last thing....if you see that a traveling vampire show is coming to your town....run as if your life depends on it...because it just might.	2001-04-26

He has to join forces with a good witch before the bad witch completes the blood cycle and rules the world.<br /> When it comes to making a interesting book, you need to have char. that have a lot of depth to them, the reader must care about the char good and the bad.  For me this didn't happen. The char's seemed flat (espc Thom) and I never found compeled to feel any emotion for them, and what what situtations they were in.<br />WITCHCRAFT isn't for the faint of heart.  There are some sick and twisted things that happen to the people that are in the control of the Evil Witch. The reader never sees what happned to them, just we're told. And believe me, that's enought.<br />**THIS  MAY BE A SPOILER**  One of the biggest problems I had is when the two Witches fought. I won't say who won, but we never see the fight.  We just find out one witch gets killed. I would have like to read about the fight.  It would have been interesting to see witches using their powers.<br />There's something I can't talk about b/c they are major spoilers. <br />Over all, was this a bad book? No.  I suggest it if you can find it at a used bookstore, or get it from the library.	2001-04-26

It's incredible!!  This book has everything a great book should have. Interesting char, plot twists, and a writing style that holds the readers attention.<br />When it comes to char's, they have to be interesting.  For the good guys, Alex Cross has what it takes. Smarts, courage, and is never willing to give up.  He has to get back two children that were taken my the master criminal Gary Soneji.  The reader can't help but to be drawn to Cross.<br />For the bad guys, the reader has to be drawn to them...and you'll be drawn to Gary Soneji.  Throught the powerful writing style of Patterson, the reader will get into Soneji's head, and see what makes him tick.  We are exposed to his backgroud and see what has  happned to Soneji as a child to shape the monster that he is.  When you read about Soneji's childhood, the reader can't help but to feel sympathy.<br />Patterson has a writing style that will keep the reader guessing what will happen next, right up the the last page. There are so many plot twists in ALONG CAME A SPIDER, it will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br />If you saw the movie, and liked it, then I highly suggest you run, not walk to the nearest bookstore, and get this book.

Each books keeps getting better and better. I also like how Anita grows as you get further and further in the series.  She's getting more powerful.<br />As the plot of the book opens, Anita has to raise a few dead bodies that are a couple hundred years old to settle a dispute over who actually owns some land. Simple enough, right? Well if your a fan of this series you know that nothing is what it seems.  This book is no exception.  Soon Anita is in the middle of vampires, Zombies, and people who want her dead. This is nothing new in the life of Anita Blake.  To make things more difficult, she has to call on Jean Claude, a master vampire for help.  What's the big secret that people are being killed over?  Read Bloody Bones and find out.<br />As I said eariler, Anita is growing as the series goes on. She's tough as nails and twice as sharp.<br />So far, this is my favorite book of the series. If you want to get as much pleasure from the book as you possible can, you need to start with the first book and work your way through. Give yourself a treat and read the seires.<br />Hamilton has a writing sytle that keeps the reader glued to the page, and never let's them go.  If you read this book, you won't be sorry.	2001-04-19

Savvy McKinnon is a reporter for a gossip paper much like The Globe.  She has been doing an artice on Count Yorga, a self-porclaimed vamipre.  Savvy get's a call from the Count, and he's not pleased. The next thing that Savvy know's is that she's on her way to do an &quot;interview with a vampire&quot;.  Then the Count drops dead, and bites her in the process, Savvy's life will change. She is getting pale, and smack dab in the middle mystery.  Savvy had to find out who killed the Count, why he was killed, and how can she stay alive.  Alls in a days work for a reporter.<br />The char were weak and not really developed. I felt that most of the char's could have been in a Film Noir movie, complete with the cheesy dialouge and the predictible (in the Film Noir world) situations that the chars found themself in.  <br />This is a shrt book of just under 200 pages and is a quick read.  If you're looking for a detailed vampire book, this isn't it.  Granted, this isn't a bad read, just don't expect to much.<br />Condider this as a book that starts off as a watered down vampire book with an X-Files ending.  <br />You might want to give this book a chance. There was a lot of toung and cheekness to it.	2001-04-11

It stays true to the show as the dialouge stays true to the chars.  I have a lot I want to say about this wonderful book.<br />First I want to talk about the chars in this book. The one that stands out the most is Faith. Holder takes the reader in a journey into the world of Faith. Her thoughts, feelings, and at times her jealous feelings.  The show has hinted to Faith's pasts, and what makes her tick....this book, goes where the show leaves off. At times, the reader will feel compassion for her. She just wants what Buffy has. Friends, a watcher, and a mother who loves her. Faith has a tough outter shell, but under that shell is what the reader will discover. <br />The plot is one for a great movies would be made.  A big ole demon wants to eat the soul of slayers. Once he has done this, he will walk the earth....and there will be no more slayers...ever. There will be no &quot;Chosen One&quot; for the rest of time. Buffy and faith can't fight this demon alone. They have to call on two slayers, India and Kendra that have been killed. Together, all four slayers must unite and defeat this demon. If they can't, the world will come to an end. The Slayers fight side by side in an exciting and dramitic conclusion.  This is an incredible read.<br />But this book comes with a warning. You need to have a vast knowlege of the Buffy series, buffy books, and authors of vampire books. &quot;The Book of Fours&quot; is a very detailed and extremely deep book. You may want to read  &quot;Drew and Spike: Pertty Maids all in a Row&quot; by Chistopher Golden and &quot;The Gatekeep Trilogy&quot; by Nancy Holder and Christopher Golden.  Now, do you *have* to read these books before this one? No, but it clears up somethings.  Holder does a good job to fill the reader in on what happened, but it still better to have read the books.<br />I liked how Holder used Kathleen Ramsland in her book. It was a wonderful touch.<br />I also liked how Holder is a wonderful jobin creating a past for the slayers, and the evil that's waiting to be released.<br />This is a wonderful read, and will keep the reader glued to the pages to see what happens next. I highly suggest this book. You won't be sorry.  If your a fan of Buffy, you need to add this book to your collection.	2001-04-07

I literally coudn't put this down. I read it in 2 days.  The Lunatic Cafe works on so many levels.<br />There is something out there that's killing werewolf's, a good number of them as a matter of fact. So who do they call for help? Our favorite vampire slayer, and the raiser of the dead, Anita Blake.  Things get complicated when she's fallen in love with a werewolf. As if that's not enough for our favorite slayer, there's a long line of people trying to kill her. What's a slayer to do?  Find out who's killing the werewolves, and if anyone gets on her way, she's well armed and has a very good aim. Ofcourse, we can't forget about the Master Vampire of the City, Jean-Claude. He has an interesting proposal for Anita. Will she take it? Can she find out who's killing the werewolf?  Can Edward help? To find out the answers, you need to pick up this book.<br />The char's are very impressive. With each book, Anita gets stronger and stronger.   The tension mounts between Richard and Jean-Claude plays a important sub plot to this book.  The reader will see how devoted Richard is to Anita, and how far he will go to protect her.<br />With this book, we get to see a new &quot;mosnter&quot;. Okay, maybe &quot;monster&quot; is to strong of a word, but it fits.<br />Hamilton is a wonderful storyteller, this is a perfect example of what I mean.  There are so many times I wanted to put it down, then there was a plot twist, and I had to find out what happened. The writing style that Hamilton has, keeps the reader glued to the page. I can promise you that if you start this book, you'll be fighting to put it down.<br />Sit back and enjoy the world that Laurell K. Hamilton creates.	2001-04-06

Mr. King tried something new (I won't say what it is, you'll have to read it to find out) and it worked.  Let's face it, King is such a wonderful writer, he could write the phone book and it will sell.<br />The plot is pretty basic...at first. Some life long friends have a yearly ritual.  They go hunting in the woods.  Well this year, something goes wrong, horrible wrong that will change the life of humanity forever.  If you want to find out what happened....then read the book.<br />The characterization  that King gives his char is just incerdible.  You can't help to care about each one.  Persoanlly, my favorite is Beaver. He's soooooo funny. You can't just help but to love him.  One char was in a car accident.  To read what the char went through, you can't help but to think that King was telling what he went through.  It really gave me chills reading that part. I also liked the char of Duddits.  He has a special relationship with the characters in this book.  I also liked what motivated the char to do what they did.<br />What I also liked is that you can't tell who the good guys are. Just b/c they say their good, doesn't make it so.  <br />I was suprised to see that this book is getting such a low ratings from people. King tries something different in his writing style, and it works. But to each their own. I loved this book<br />Once you start to read Dreamcatcher, you won't be able to put it down. I highly suggest this book.<br />The race for humanity is on. Who will win....buy this book and find out.  You won't be sorry.	2001-04-06

When I finished this book, that's all I could say....&quot;NO WAY&quot;!! This book has soooo much to offer the reader. In some parts, it's sooooo funny, and other parts very violent.  The reader will be laughing at such things as a Diansour named Toothy, and be terrified by the Popcorn King.<br />Some friends take part in a weekly activity of going to a drive in to take part in a all night horror-a-thon. When a comet come and changes their life...forever.   The Drive-in becomes a movie.... I won't say to much about this book, b/c i don't want to ruin it...but once you start, you won't be able to put it down.<br />My favorite part that had me laughing do hard was what Randy did with this popcorn bucket. *LOL*  This is a very funny book, but dont' mistake this for a comedy b/c this is a very violent and scary book.<br />The char that Landsdale created are very lifelike.  They are char that the reader cares about that will make the reader turn the page and not want to put this down.<br />If you start this book, you won't be sorry. Just when it's late at night....watch out for the Popcorn King....	2001-03-29

This is your way to make a difference in somebody's life.<br />If you're a fan of Harry Potter, you need to get these books.  These are a fantastic supplement to a wonderful series. In the Harry Potter series two mentioned.  &quot;Fantastic Beasts &amp; Where to Find Them&quot; and &quot;Quidditch Through the Ages&quot;.  It's interesting to read about these books, having the characters refering to them, then actually buying the books.<br />Fantastic Beasts &amp; Where to find them. I can't say enough about this book. It's a wonderful read.  The reader will read about the  beasts in the Harry Potter series, and get to know where they are located.  What I liked about this book is that it covered Beasts that were in this book, and might be in feature books. I also liked how each beast has it's own code to how dangerous it is, and who is best to deal with it.<br />Quidditch through the ages.  This is an outstanding book to go along with the series. You can see how Quidditch has grown over the centuries, what the teams are in Britain and Ireland, what the different positions are, what they mean, anti-muggle precautions,and finally Quidditch today.<br />Both of these books add so much pleasure to the series. If you love the series, then I *highly* suggest you get these. They are very cheap to buy, and all of the money that these books earn goes to charity. It's a win win situation.<br />Buy these books, you won't be sorry.	2001-03-29

I had such high expecataions with this book. Everyone I know has such good things to say....I just didn't see it.<br />The char's were extremely flat and undeveloped. I was confused by what was going on between Vicki and Celluci. Are they lovers?  Are they just ex-partner?  Is it just casual sex between them?  It jsut seemed forced and very uncomfortable to read. I also wasn't impressed with Henry either. He too seemed flat. You get to read about Henry's past, but it seemed to slow the plot down.<br />Huff used caps way to much. THIS IS SO DISTRACTING TO READ, OVER AND OVER AGAIN. See, this that annoying? Way to much of that. It was also annoying having the char talk to themselves as much as they did. I mean, who talks to themselves that much. It seems that all of the char's were doing it.<br />I was talking about these issues to someone who likes the series, and she told me to stick with it, it get's better.  She also told me that the char's get more developed as the series goes on. I have the books, and plan to read the rest. I just wasn't impressed with the first book.<br />If you want to read about a vampire hunter, I highly suggest the Anita Blake series by Laurell K. Hamilton.	2001-03-29

If you have never read a Buffy book, or have no idea who Spike and Dru are, you can pick this book up and not miss anything.  Golden does that good of a job writing this book.  He combines the myth of the Buffy series, and the backdrop of WWII in an interesting and creative story.<br />The char's are incredible.  Golden has nailed the char of Spike and Dru down pat.  But there is so much more to this book besides Spike and Dru.<br />The plot is increbidle. It's Dru's birthday and Spike wants to make sure he get's the prefect gift.  He makes a deal with a unique demon. Spike and Dru must do one thing that this demon aske's the the gift will belong ot Dru. I won't say what the task is, or what the gift is, you'll have to read it to find out.<br />The action and fight scenes are packed with action.  The reader will (as did I) have a hard time putting this down, once they get into it.  <br />Through Golden's wonderful style of writing, the reader will get a good understanding of how much Dru and Spike love each other.  It was interesting to see how Spike was in the past, before he met Buffy. Violent and rulthess, and when he wanted to do something, he did it. If anyone stood in his way, Spike took them out...voilently.<br />This is a must read if you like good fiction or a fan of Spike and Dru. I highly suggest this book.  You won't be sorry.	2001-02-26

When I saw Voice of the Blood, I was really excited to read this book.  I was really disappointed in this book.  I found the char's weak and a lack of a plot.<br />The chars were very week. As a female char, Ariane, was really weak. She was lead around by her nose and did what everyone said and wanted.  I honestly feel that there was no motivation for the actions she did. This was truley a wear female character.<br />Ricari was a weak vampire. I found his motivations weak and pointless.  I felt Ricari could have been more of a strong character is he was developed more.<br />Out of all the characters, Daniel was the weakest. Throught the book, we were told that Daniel was a violent monster, that was worse of the worse and bad of the bad.  Then when we finally were intorduced to him, he was weak as well. He did nothing violent or ruthless. He was so passive, it was almost funny.<br />I also felt this book lacked a plot. There was no focal foing ot this book. It was just sex between  human and human, human and vampire.  I don't mind sex in a book, but let it have a point.<br />You can read this book, at your own risk.  If you want my opinion. Take a pass on this book.	2001-02-26

To say this is incredible isn't doing this book justice.  On Writing in set up in three parts. An autoboigraphical section, a section that King tells the secrets and craft to would be writers, and then King talks about his accident.<br />This book works on so many levels, if you like King's works, you'll love this. If you like a biography, this is for you, and if you're a would be writer, King offers his words of wisdom on the craft of writing.  On Writing, has something for everyone.  Trust me.<br />The autobiographical section is wonderful. There was a few parts when I was laughing out loud and other parts I was moved to tears.  King openly talks about his addiction to drugs and alcohol. After reading that part of the book, it's obvious that Tabby saved his life.  I was also touched on how much Stephen and Tabby love each other...she's a major influence in his work. It's also interesting how the reader will get the background and the behind the secnes aspect to his books. A lot of Kings life an be seen in his books throught the symbolism that is in his characters.  Its' incredible....<br />If your a writer, this book is a must for you!!  Stephen King is giving us what it takes to be a good writer. People spend good money to take classes on how to be a good writer...and alls you need is to purchase this book! Even in paperback, what a deal. Stephen King is giving you advise!  As a would be writer I plan to follow what King is telling you. The things that King tell the would be writer, is priceless!  If anybody wants to be a writer, don't enroll in any writing class....buy this book. <br />The last part of the book, King talks about his accident. This part of the book was the hardest for me to read...it's chilling.   My heart sank when King gave the details of his accident.  The pain and suffering that King went through is so sad.  It's amazing that he's still alive.<br />I can't say enough about this book. I encourage everyone to go out and buy this book.  I promise you, you won't be sorry.  On Writing, works on so many levels.  Do yourself a favor, and buy this book.  On Writing is a wonderful book.  Trust me.	2001-02-12

Take what you know about vampires...and toss it out the window.  When you do this, your all set for this wonderful book.<br />The story is about the catholic church wages war aganist the vampires.  But the reader will be glued to the book and will be shocked on who the bad guys are and who the good guys are.  Everything isn't what it seems.  I can't give away to much of the book, but this book builds up and up to an fantastic ending, that will leave the reader speechless.<br />Christopher  Golden is a wonderful story teller who has a unique style of writing.  I like how he takes a new twist on the vampire myth.  I was glued to the book, and had to force myself to put it down.<br />If your a fan of vampire fiction, I suggest you pick this up and you won't be sorry.	2001-02-12

As I said above, The House has some very good plot twists, but I had a hard time reading this.  For me, the biggest problem is that this book was very repetitive. Once you read about what one character goes through, then we have to read about 3 other characters that have to go through the samething. It was just hard for me to get through.<br />    That being said, this book does has things to offer. I found myself glued to what happened to a character the first time I read what was happening.  When it comes to decription, Little is wonderful. The secnes of horror were so  detailed, it gave me the shivers.<br />     The plot of the book is simple....and yet complex.  Some adults have to go back to their childhood house and face their worse fears.<br />      This was my first book, and even though I gave it only 3 stars, I plan to read more of Little.	2001-02-01

Circus of the Damned, is a wonderful, violent, exciting and a real page turner and a hell of a book<br />   What I really like in this series, is that Anita Blake get's stronger and stronger as a female character. Anita is everything you want in a hero, tough, sexy, and smart.  Anita lives in a work of Werewolves, shapeshifters, vampires and zombies.<br />   In this book, Jean-Claude still wants Anita to be his human servent...the problem is that there is another vampire (who is very old and very powerful) who wants Anita for his human servant as well. Anita does the only thing she can...and I won't tell you what what is. If you want to find out what happens, you'll have to read it for yourself. :)  I can promise you, you won't be sorry.       One would think that 2 master (and powerful) vampires are enough for this book....but Anita has to battle aganist a giant snake!!  I can't stress enough how good this book really is.<br />   Laurell K. Hamilton is a wonderful story teller who keeps the reader glued to the book with a wonderful style of action, suspence, humor and horror. Hamilton offers the reader a solid plot with many, many twists.  Once you start reading Circus of the Damned, you'll have a hard time putting it down. If you start this book you won't be sorry.	2001-01-26

Hamilton delivers with her second  Anita Blake book.  In this world, vampire, werewolves and zombies roam.  They reek havoc on the night, and we need a savior....and have one. Her name is Anita Blake.<br />  In this book, someone has raised a 300 year old zombie, and it's on the war path.  Anyone in it's way, it destroys....violently I might add.  It's up to Anita to find the zombie and bring it down. The may seem like enought for a book...but Anita is also up aganist a voodoo preistess...who's very powerful and very angry with Anita, and will kill her at all costs.  <br />    Hamilton writes with a style that keeps the reader interested untill the very last page. Hamilton is a very strong writer.  When most writers write a &quot;gross out&quot; scene, they just go for the gorss out, and then end it.  Hamilton isn't like that. She's blends horror, humor and suspence in her writings.  <br />    Antia is an interesting character.  She's tough.  When her back is to the wall, she comes out fighting.  She'll tell anyone anything, and not give it a second thought. I just adore her. :)<br />    I highly suggest you start with the first book called &quot;Guilty Pleasures&quot; and read them right though.  I promise you won't be sorry.	2001-01-25

It seems like that there was a lot happing, and there was no reason for it.  An example of this can be seen with any scenes with the vampires.  There was no purpose for them, the were just there for Buffy to stake.  It just slowed down the plot.<br />     I also felt that Gallagher didn't have a good grasp on the characters.  This just din't have a &quot;Buffy feel&quot; to it.  It just seems that Gallagher wanted to write a novel that had a strong female character, and she heard that Buffy was one, and went with it.  The characters were put in situations that were never explained to the read.   Granted, when one picks up a Buffy book, they are familar with the show and know what's going on, but I just felt that an explaniation was needed.<br />      I know it sounds like I'm trashing the book, but there was one aspect that I did like.  Gallagher has a strong grasp on the dealings with tarot card.  That was one part of the book that I was impressed with.  That's the kind of background that should have gone into the rest of this book.<br />      If your a fan of tarot cards, then I *hughly suggest this book.  If your a Buffy fan, then maybe you'll want to pass on it.	2001-01-21

Goul Trouble is such an outstanding book!!  There are so many positive things to say about this, I don't know where to start.           I guess the best place to start is with a quick summary of Goul Trouble.  When Buffy and the Scooby gang are on patrol, they discover a pit with human bones that have been picked clean.  It's up to Buffy and the Scooby gang to find out who did this and stop them.  A new all female band named, Vyxn, has come to Sunnydale and is headlining at the Bronz. They seem to have a strange hold over the male population, and the male population seems to be dwindling out...one by one.  It's up to Buffy and her crew to find out what's going on. But she has other problems. She has to track a vampire that can walk during the day, and has a mission.   His mission is to hunt the slayer down, and killer.  Not to much for our favorite slayer to handle....or is it?<br />     One of Passarella's strenghts is that he portrays the characters in his book as they are on the show. I mean they are *exactly* the same. I have never seen an author be as loyal to the show as Passarella is.   I swear that I could hear the char. of the show speak.  It's incredibe.       The scene when Solitaire and Angel fight is so incredible!  Passarella's writing style really comes throught, the images just leap off the page.<br />     I really like how Passarella play on the friendship of Willow and Xander. It's obvious how much they mean to each other, and what they are willing to do for one another.  When it comes to these two charcaters, Willow was seen as innocent as she in on the tv show. As was Xander was his usual self. *LOL*<br />     I was also impressed on the two seperate plot in Goul Trouble. Most of the time when there are more than one plot, the author tends to favor one plot and let the second slide. This is *not* the case. Passarella does a powerful job on the 2 seperate plots, and are both constructed with care.   Kuddo's to Passarealla.  It's easy to see that Passarella cares deeply about his work.<br />     This books works on so many levels.  If you like Buffy books, then you won't want to pass this book up.  Also if you like good fiction from an author who has a wondeful style of writing, then you need to read this book.  I can't stress this enought, if you read this book, you won't be sorry.	2001-01-20

As soon as I saw the Elizabeth Massis wrote a Buffy book, I had to buy it. I so made the right choice!!  What a wonderful Buffy book!  Where the &quot;villians&quot; came from....what a CLASSIC idea!!  <br />Mo Moon and her daughters, Calli and Polly, are in Sunnydale and they want to spread one thing...girl power.  Soon they have the will of all the girls on their side and the men are mindless idiots. It's up to our favorite slayer, OZ and cordy to save Sunnydale.  Once you get into this book, it won't let you go.  This is a real page tuner.<br />There are so many great things to this book!!  Cordy's jealousy came through as halirous!!  It was interesting to see her when she wasn't lil miss popular. *LOL*  I also liked Xander.  <br />The decriptions that Massie gives the reader is incredible!  She is a wonderful storyteller.

If you didn't like the movie, which I didn't, then you'll like the book, as I also did. <br />Here is a quick review of the book. Casanova is a collector of something rare and beautiful....women.  When he sees one he thinks is both beautiful and rare, he takes them and keeps them in his personal collection.  The problem comes when he takes a family member of Alex Cross, a dectieve.  Alex is soon  on the case to get back the one he loves. There are also murders across the coast on the opposite side of the states. Could there be two serial killers  wanting to out do each other? Or are they working together? If so, how can Alex Cross stop them both? I suggest that you read the book if you want to find out. <br />Alex Cross is an interesting character. I liked how he had an instant bond with Kate.  It seems that Kate and Alex we're almost a mirror image of each other. <br />When it comes to fiction, it's important to have &quot;good&quot; good guys, but I feel it's more important to have better bad guys.  Patterson accomplishes this.  Cassanova and The Gentleman are *incredible* some of the things that Casanova does is out right creepy.  <br />The style that Patterson writes in take a little getting used to. It's in both first and third person. When you get used to that, it's a sinch to read. The chapters are 2 and 1/2 pages tops.<br />The book goes into way more detail that the movie.  As I said, if you didn't like the movie, you'll like the book.	2000-12-27

First off I want to say how suprised I am that this book has recieved such a mixed rewiew.  I thought this was outstanding, right to the very last page!  The characters are really believeable, and the reader can't help but to care about them, even the mean and evil ones.<br />Now for a quick review.  In the previous 3 installments of The Vampire Legacy, Deirdre has told us that her daughter died at birth, because that's what she believed....but it's not so.  She is very much alive and ready to seek vengenace aganit her mother who left her for dead. The daughter, Lily, wants to kill Deirdre, but before that happens, she wants to take everything her mother has....including her lover, Mitch. The way that Taylor writes will keep the reader engaged until the very last page.<br />What an interesting char Lily is.   The reader will see how she's  hell bent on revenge she is. Her anger, bitterness, and rage is easily seen. Taylor knows exactly how to create a angry teenager. <br />As usual Deirdre is wonderful.  I can't san enough good things about her.<br />I also like how Taylor keeps you up to date with characters that has been in this wonderful series from book one. When you see the characters, it's like seeing old friends. You want to know what's happening with then.<br />If you haven't read any of the books before this one, I urge you to go out and find them. I can promise you that you won't be sorry!<br />This entire series works on two levels.  If you like good fiction, then get this book. If you like Vampire fiction, then again, you need to get this book. I can't say enough good things about The Vampire Legacy.	2000-12-23

At times, I had to put the book down b/c Clegg goes into great detail and plays on the readers fears.<br />This can book can be enjoyed on so many levels b/c it has so many themes.  Faith, love, facing the mistakes of our past, and forgiveness.  Or if you like like to have the willies scared out of you. *LOL* Something for everyone.<br />  Joe is a writer that is coming home to see his mother, and to face his past and the town who doesn't really want him back. There was an accident that should have killed him when he was a teen, that didn't. It's took the life of the woman he loved.  Joe has much more to worry about...someone is killing the Childern of the town. The same thing that was killing kids when he left.  Old evil never dies...it just waits...<br />Clegg creates characters that are so lifelike, that the reader insinally cares about all of them.  We get sucked in b/c Clegg lets the reader know the residents of the town, their lives and their dirty little secrets.  Clegg also does a wonderful job of linking the past and the present.  You'd think that we would be confused by that, but you won't.<br />One of my favorite lines is &quot;I may not belive in mosters, but I think they believe in me.&quot; When I read that, it really stuck with me through the book.<br />This isn't an easy book to find. But it's worth the search, and you'll be rewarded with a good scare from this woderful book....<br />Happy Hunting!	2000-12-16

An interesting sidenote is that the idea of &quot;Superstitions&quot; actually happened.  Ambose tells about the orginal experiment in the acknowledgements of the book.<br />Here is a quick recap of this novel.  Sam Towne want's to try an experiment. He wants to get a group and try to create a ghost.  When they meet, the group creats &quot;Adam&quot;.  The group has given Adam a history...life, adventures, love, a past, and a death.  Things start to get freaky for the group when they make contact with Adam. It starts off with a few table knocks...but that's nothing....Adam has something instore for them...and it just may come at a high price, their sanity. And for some, it will be a much higher price...their life. This book makes one point, be careful for what you wish for, you may just get it.<br />David Ambrose is a wonderful author.  I came across this book on a bargin bin, and decided to take a chance on it.  Boy did I make a wise decision!!  There are so many plot twists and spooky happenings, that the reader can't help but to be hooked. Superstitions also has a *wicked* ending. I never saw it coming. <br />If you like ghost stories, or the X-files, I highly, highly suggest this book. It will give you a case of the heebie jeebies.  I can't say enough about this book.  Once you start it, it will be hard to put down.<br />Remember: Becareful what you wish for, you may just get it.	2000-12-16
US	51266167	R1GTQJ0AAFXJT0	0786012412	98925889	The Vampire Legacy (Blood Ties, #3)	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Her best yet!!	I first want to start off by saying that Blood Ties is Karen E. Taylor's best book yet!  Before I go on, I'll give a short rundown on the book. This is the 3rd book in The Vampire Legacy. In this installment, the Carde, a secret society of vampires, ask Deirdre and Mitch to catch someone who is killing humans and vampires. The book leads up to an exciting showdown  that could cost Deidre and Mitch their life.  <br />There are so many wonderful things about this book.  One strong point is that Deirdre gets to lean more about what it's like to be a vampire, and the powers that she has, and the power of what she  has to discover. I liked how the reader learns about Deirdre, as she learns about herself.  I also liked how the reader gets to see how alone Deidre was when she was first given the dark gift.  Let's face it, she had nobody to show her the ropes.  With Mitch, it's a different story, he has Deirdre and The Cadre and the journals that Max had to show him how to be a vampire. I dare say that Deidre was a bit jealous of that.<br />I was very impressed with Mitch and how he he has handled the Dark Gift of being a vampire. There were a couple of times when I was under the impression that he though the humans were below the vampires on the food chain (no pun intended). I also liked how he was able to learn so much so fast on being a vampire.<br />I *loved* the character of Vivienne. What a playful little vampire. *LOL*  She has sexuality and charm and loves to tease. I hope that we get to know more of her history.<br />I also liked how Deirdre feels responsible for the killings. Deirdre feels a &quot;Blood Tie&quot; with the killer (I can't say who it is) b/c she helped create him. Even though it was an accident, she still feels that she's to blame for what happened. At first She feels compassion towrds the killer, b/c he has had nobldy to show him (the killer) how to be a vampire.  The compassion that Deirdre feels can be the described as the compassion a mother feels for her child.<br />I also like the way Larry, doesn't like being a vampire. Even though he wanted to be one, and Deirdre tried to tell him what a hell it is, and he wouldn't listen.  When the reality of being a vampire hits him, he realizes that Deirdre was right.<br />One of the strengths of Karen's books is that they all play off each other. One book sets up the next, and Blood Ties is no exception.  Her skill as a writer make this a pleasure to read with the plot twists that keeps you hooked till the last page.<br />After you read the frist two (Blood Secret and Bitter Blood) I highly suggest you read this book.  Heck, read the frist two books, just to take pleasure in reading this book.	2000-12-16

(don't worry, there aren't any spolers here) Deirdre is a  vampire, but she's not an evil one. She will never drain her victims, but she does feed. She wants to find out if there are others, and learn from them. The only problem is that there is another vampire that's killing the innocent, and is making sure that all of the guilt is pointing at Deirdre.  As the story unfolds, she falls in love with Mitch, who is headng the investagation.  <br />The characters...<br />Deirdre-What a fantastic vampire.  The way that Karen E. Talyor has introduced us to Deirdre, there is so much for us to learn about her. What make is such a fun read is that as Deirdre learns about herself, we will also learn about her. Deirdre has a lot to lean about being a vampire, it will be interesting to see how she turns out.<br />Mitch-He's an interesting char. as well. I was interested in how he would act when he found out who she was.<br />Max-Here is one complex and mysterous guy.  I saw him as a pimp in a way for Deirdre. He's always finding guys for Deirdre to feed on.  I had a hard time putting my finger on Max. Was he good? Is he bad? I couldn't figure out if he wanted to be her lover, her father, a protector? The reader will be guessing that until the end.   What a great character.<br />Larry-He's a guy that wanted to be a vampire, and that's all I'll say about him...he provides a lot of tension through the book.<br />Overall, I'll tell you to get this book. Taylor entertains the writer with a style of writing that will hold the readers interest.  She won't tell the reader to much about Deirdre, Mitch , or Max, and that provides to much for the reader!  There is also tension between Max and Mitch that will keep the reader engaged until the last page.<br />My two favorite scenes are when Mitch gives Max a ticket (I won't say for what). My other favorite scene is when Deirdre, Mitch, and a few others are out for dinner, thereare so many inside jokes that Mitch says...*LOL* It's a hoot!!<br />Take my word for it, if you start this series, you won't be sorry.	2000-12-03
US	51266167	RJ7YLU61GZNY7	0786012420	41949348	Bitter Blood (The Vampire Legacy #2)	Books	4	9	11	N	N	Deirdre is back!	What a fantastice book.  This picks up two years after the first book ends. Deirdre gets word that Mitch in a hospital for the insane, and she hops the next flight back to the states to help him. Little does show know that Mitch is being used as bait for Deirdre.  It seems that there is a vampire clan that's after Dierdre for killing their master.  <br />This book is wonderful.  Ther are so many plot twists that it will keep the reader engaged. At the end of the book, something happens to Mitch and Deirdre has to turn Mitch into a vampire. This isn't spoiling anything, one can read this on the backcover.<br />What I liked is that Max has returned.  What made this so powerful in the book is that the reader will not be sure if Max is really back.   As I was reading, I was wondering if Max had a very stong bond to Deirdre, a bond that death couldn't berak or if Max was a symbol of guilt for what Deirdre did to Max.<br />There are a couple of reasons wha I really like this book.  The first thing that that Deirdre leans more about being a vampire.  The other reason why I like this book is that it set's up the third.<br />Before you read this book, you need to read the first book.  If you read this first, you may become lost. I highly suggest this series, you won't be sorry.	2000-12-03
US	51266167	R3S27B5AC0C0CP	0449002004	536318000	Vampire Hunter	Books	4	6	6	N	N	What a good book!	Vampire Hunter is wonderful work of vampire fiction!  Charles is a wonderful char of what a vampire should be. Yes he is a vampire, and he has killed, but he feels remorse and shame for what he has done.  <br />When a research team is making a docoumtary on the Titanic, they release Charles (the vampire) from his watery grave. When they do that, nobody can survive.  The problem is that one of the people Charles kills, the womans husband is hell bent on revenge to find him, and rid the world of a vampire.  I don't want to give to much away, but trust me when I say this is a good read.<br />The Characters.  Charles the vampire.  What a great char. He's smart, savvy  everything a &quot;Gentleman&quot; should be. It was a hoot to see how Charles has to adapt to a &quot;modern woman&quot;.  How they talk and how they dress.<br />Desiree. This girl is prue evil.  She wants to show Charles how evil she is, but has no idea what it's like to be a real vampire.  Some of the things she does is horrible. She provides some wonderful tension for Charles.<br />Richard. He is bent on revenge b/c Charles kills his wife. There are some interesting symbolic qualites that Richard has that can be seen with Ahab from Moby Dick.  He's more than willing to work outside of the law to meet his objectives.<br />Over all this book is pretty good. I do admit that it may start off a bit slow, but as the story moves on, it get's more interesting.  I highly suggest Romkey's book, I, Vampire.  Vampire Hunter will not disappoint those of you who like vampire fiction. If you read this book, you won't be sorry.	2000-11-11
US	51266167	R321JAXONI2J8F	0671034855	552051704	Portraits of Guilt	Books	5	6	8	N	N	What an incredible woman....	This is such an incredilbe book! Words can't dsescribe it, buy I'll give it my best shot.<br />First I want to say what an incredible woman Jeanne Boylan is!  When she goes and does a portrait of the person that's on the run, it was said that Jeanne is a &quot;mavrick&quot; or a &quot;rogue&quot; when it comes to doing portraits. That she uses &quot;extreme ways&quot; to get the drawing done. Know what her &quot;extreme ways&quot; that make her a &quot;rouge&quot; or a &quot;mavrick&quot;? It's simple, she gives a damn. In case after case, she doesn't just go in and do the drawing and leave, she takes time to get to know the victim.  In once case (I won't say which one~can't spoil it) she had a famous actor help the healing process for one of the people she helped. You may ask why she does this?  It's simple, she was the victim of a horrible crime, and Jeanne, knows what it feels like to be a victim.  <br />What imperssed me so much is how Jeanne does't want the credit. It's not important to her.  In one case, she broke the case open and the local police never gave her credit. They went as far as to say that she never helped.  But she insn't looking for praise, she just wants to help and catch the guilty. She has help in catching the most dangerous people that are out there...she deserves credit.<br />This is a woman who put everything on the line for her job. Her marriage, personal time....people like Jeanne should be honored for the compassion that she has.  Far to many times we honor soprts figures who get paid millions of dolars and then get introuble with the law. Then people like Jeanne who are doing good never get mentioned. This seems so unfair.  I hvae the up most respect for Jeanne.  People like her should be known, and the serverices she has mad (and will make) to us.<br />Jeanne-if your reading this, I just want to say &quot;thank you.&quot;.<br />I urge all of you to read this book and know what a true hero is.	2000-10-28

There is so much that I like about this book, I dont' know where to start.<br />First, lets start with a mini review.  As the book opens, Harry is heading off the the Quidditch World Cup. Ofcourse, when he's there, something happens, and it's lead to believe that he-who-musn't-be-named will show up soon.  As Harry gets set for his 4th year at Hogwarts, he soon learns that Quidditch will not be played this year. Instead a new contest will be held, Triwizards Tournament&quot;. This is when a couple of Wizards Schools meet (at Hogwarts this year) and one from each School is picked by the &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;. Harry is to young to be entered, but that last name that the &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; spits out is our favorite wizard, Harry Potter.  Now who could have put in Potter's name? Was it Snape? Skeeter  Could he do that? You'll have to read to find out.<br />I liked the character of Moody. What a great character.  I also have been impressed with Herminoe.  She is my favorite character.<br />What I like is how all of the books flow into each other and how they all srring board off each other.  This book is a bit darker than the rest. What makes this darker is that fact that there is a murder. This isn't spoiling anything, Rowling made this known before the book came out.<br />What also draws me to the series that that we get to know more and more about each of the characters as the books come out.<br />I highly suggest that you read this book.  Rowling has a genius mind, and it can easily be seen.	2000-10-28
US	51266167	R3DSSAKK294STX	0451168089	165977133	Salem's Lot	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Can I give it more stars??	First off, I want to say that I'm a HUGE King fan. King delivers his usual scary story is Salem's Lot. I dare say that this is one of the best vampire novels that I've read. I rank this up there with &quot;I am Legend&quot;.<br />As the story opens, Ben is returning to his childhood home to write a story. As this story unfolds, Ben and some unwilling people turn into vampire slayers to rid the town of the vampire and his buddy.  The problem is that the vampire is turning the people of this small town into vampires as well. So Ben and the slayers, have to deal with many of the people that were &quot;made&quot; into a vampire.<br />You may ask what makes this different than any vampire book. Well, let's take a look, shall we...<br />The Characters: One of the reasons why this is such a powerful book is that there is no one main character. Okay...one *might* make take the view that Ben is the main character...maybe. The way  King writes, I honestly feel that everyone is a &quot;main character. He gives almost equal time among everyone in the book. At 2 places in the book, King breaks the narrative of the book and starts telling the reader about other things that are happening to different characters.  I feel this makes the reader care about the character, and what's going to happen to them. It's almost as if they are friends of yours.   This is why King is one of the best writers today. There are some awesome plot twists that I can't go into (cuz it would spoil some parts) that are just outstanding.<br />The Vampire:  Barlow is wonderful.  He is such a powerful force in the book.  You don't really see Barlow untill you get towards the end, but you know he's there.  What makes him such a powerful character is that he so charming.  This can be seen in a letter that he wrote to &quot;the slayers&quot;.  When it comes to vampire fiction, it takes time to establish the &quot;charm&quot; of the vampire. A perfect example of this is Lestate from Interview with a vampire.  However with King's vampire, Barlow, the reader will see his charm right away. <br />I highly, highly suggest this book if  A) You're a King fan or  B) a fan of vampire fiction.<br />You won't be sorry.	2000-10-15

Okay, this is the fist and last book I have read (and will read) by Haog.  There are several aspects that I hade a problem with...<br />To  start off with, the book was to long.  The first 300 pages were hard to get through...but that being said, the last 397 were decent.<br />Far to many jokes. The polcie and the FBI are trying to catch a serial killer who burns his victims. When they find the bodies (and all through the investagation) the police are making jokes. It was explained that it was done to break the tension...but enough was enough.   After a while, it was starting to get on my nevrves.<br />To many plots lines. I can't really go into details, b/c I don't want to give any spoilers away, but there were to much going on for one book. I felt it would have gone better if there was another book, and some of the plot lines we moved to the next book.<br />I found the char. of Kate to be interesting....When she had to be, she was tough as nails.  I liked that. I also liked the char of Quinn. He is at his best when he was &quot;interviewing&quot; Vanlees.<br />Over all, do I suggest this book? Well, if you can get it at a used bookshop, then go for it. It did have it's good parts.	2000-09-24

The start was good, and the ending  was pretty good, but some parts were a bit slow.<br />Meet Mara McCuniff,  she's tough, smart, sexy, and also a 1600 year old vampire.  This is her  story.  The reader will learn about her loves, passoins and heart  breakes.<br />I found the character of Mara intereseting.  As the story opens,  we find a young human named Mara.  He father wanted a son, and treated her  as such.  From a early age, she leaned how to fight, and become a warrior.   She could take a direct hit, and keep on going. As he became an adult, she  was still tough as nails, until she meet Gaar, he soon to be husband. He  taugh her how to love and to be a &quot;woman&quot;.  This is as far as as  I can go without spoiling the rest of the book.<br />The char. of the men were  interesting. When the story first opens the year is 362.  The men were  important and the women were second class citizens. It was very male  centered with &quot;you do this, woman. You do that Woman.&quot;I like how  Traci Briery had the male charactere change over the years, and  centuires.<br />Over all, I did like this book. However, that beign said,  there was one part I didn't like...I can't say what it is b/c it deals with  a major spoiler. If you have read the book,feel free to e-mail me and we  can talk about it.<br />I loved the Epilouge of this book!! One of the  funniest parts of the story was when mara called herself, &quot;The best  whore in London.&quot;<br />I would have like to see Mara remain a strong  female character thought the book. Even though she was a &quot;woman&quot;  and had to &quot;remain in her place&quot;. Considering her childhood, and  how she was brought up, Mara would be a believeable charachter is she was a  strong female character in the entire book.<br />Over all I liked this book  and highly suggest it to those of you who like vampire books.	2000-09-09

This is a short poem, just  4 lines, but it had a powerful effect me.  I can say that it has changed  the way I think and look at the things I fear.

Clegg wrote an out of the park homerun when he wrote his book.I read over half of the book in one sitting, it's that good.  Honestly, make sure you  have the time to spend with this book, you won't want to put it down  either.<br />As our story opens, Trey Campbell is on a vacation. He works at  Darden State Hospital.  One woman (Agnes Hatcher) who is a  &quot;guest&quot; at Darden feels that Trey is her one true love, and wants  to be with him.  Even if it means that she will kill his family and anyone  who gets in her way. She does escapes (and does a horrible thing to a  nurse) and begins her quest.  I can't give away to much, but trust me, this  book is fantastic. The climax is a real page turner. I last sentence of the  book really hit home for me.  I wish I could tell you more, but I dont'  want to ruin this wonderful novel.<br />If you buy this book (and you should)  I promise you two things. 1) You will have a hard time putting it down and  2) Before you go to bed, you will want to check your windows and doors to  make sure they'er locked.	2000-08-31

Before I go on, I just wanted to  let you guys and gals know, this isn't for sale as a book, just in tape or  cd.<br />The first is called, &quot;Lunch at the Gotham Cafe.&quot;  This is a  story of a man who is going through a divorce and has to meet his ex and  her lawyer. He has no idea at the horror which is waiting for him.  What  makes this so wonderful is when you get to the end....you undstand the  horror and what drives the person to the edge, and knows that it can happen  to any of us.  I know that makes no sense, but when you listen to the  story, it will, promise. I just dont' want to spoil it.<br />1408 is down  right spooky!! At one point I had to snap the light on b/c I got the  willies. This is a story of a man who is  &quot;ghost Hunter&quot; and has  writen several book on haunted houses and graveyards.....ect.  He thinks  he's prepared  for what awaits for him...nothing can prepare him for what's  waiting for him in Room 1408 in a hotel. What makes matters worse is that  he's an ex-smoker. Perhaps it was the wrong time to quit.  He will need all  the vices he can get...if he wants to live through the night.<br />The last  story that King reads in called, &quot;In the Deathroom&quot;.  I'm not  going to sya to much about his story, except that smoking saved the life of  a  man who is at the hands of an evil and toruous man.  Then odds swing in  the man's favor when his captors offer him a cigarette.<br />This is packaged  in a box that looks like a box of cigarettes complete with a waring in the  side. The warning tells the reader what could happen is you listen to this  in the dark. I did..the warnings are true. If you are silly enought to do  what I did, make sure your in a arms reach if the the light switch. For  when you listen to this in the dark, the rules will change and the monsters  will come out.  Beware of the dark....<br />This is a must for all King fans	2000-08-27

It was also intereseting how he wanted to know &quot;how&quot;  the vampires were created, and what makes them a vampire.  I found the dog  a powerful char. It's hard to explain why I say that, because I don't want  to give anything away.  This was a very good novel and one of the most  interesting vampires books that I've read.

I had to read this book for  a college class, and what a powerful book!   This story revolves Tim Meeker, who's brother Sam goes to fight the  Revoutionary  War.  This is also a story on a family and a town torn apart.  Some want to fight aganist the King, and others on the town (and the Meeker  family) are aganist the King. What makes this story so powerful, is that  it's focus isn't on the war itself, but the families that are left behind.   WHen a someone fights in a war, they  put their life on the line for their  country. Then a death has some honor. Well for Sam, this was not so. I  won't say how and why Sam had to die, but it was void of honor.  This  powerful novel will also show the reader what happens to the innocent  people.  My Brother Sam is Dead also shows what our soilders did, who were  considered the &quot;good guys&quot;. This is a powerful read and I highly  suggest this book. You won't be sorry.	2000-08-25

This book will give the reader a first hand  experience of what it was like to be a slave.  What makes this book so good  is that it's the words of the slave.  It's their stories and their words.   The reader will learn how they were beaten and how their families were  split up...sometimes for life.  If you have a interest in reading about  slavery, then you must add this to your collection.	2000-08-25

Harry is back for his 3rd year at Hogswarts, and he's up to his ears in trouble. There were some changes that were made, and I was glad that  Rowling made them.  I liked that people couldn't push Harry around, like he  was in the first two books.  It was also a hoot to what he did to his aunt!  heehee. Snape and gang tries to stop Harry, but as usual, goodness  prevails. I also loved the char of Black. The way the book ended.....*LOL*  Harry really stuck it to his Uncle.  I highly suggest you Muggles read this  book. there is so much I'm leaving out...but I just don't want to spoil  anything.

What a mind Rowling has.  The things she came up with when it comes to the Hogwarts School...nothing  but brilliance. The Char. of *everyone* in the book is incredible.  The  Good (Harry, Harmonie, and Ron) the bad (snape and Maloy) and the ugly  (that-who-can't-be-named) is just incredible.  As I was reading this, it  was easy to see all of the hype that goes with this.  It may seem like a  childrens book, but if you don't read the series, you are missing out on a  great book by a fantastic writer.  This 30 year old Muggle loved every  page.

Then again, this is just  my opinion. IF you want to read a good horror book, may I suggest one? It's  called &quot;It&quot; by Stephen King.  King is still the modern master of  horror.	2000-07-19
