I make my own bread and make my own butter when fancy strikes, yet the tiramisu I made using her recipe exact, was the worst cake ever. The Key Lime frozen pie I made was also terrible! Too Limey and plainly unsavory. <br />I don't think I have ever baked anything that didn't turn out unsatisfactionary until this book! <br /> <br />I like her show and recipes for shrimp scampi, side dishes, drinks, chicken dishes and salads but I will not be using her dessert recipes, I know better than that by now. <br /> <br />Too bad, it would have been a great book, but the dissert thing make me scare of using it at all.	2005-10-01

What is nice about it is that it's an actual, usable cookbook.    Yes ladies and gentlemen, you can use this book for cooking.   The recipes are creative, appealing and relatively easy to follow and they do not require obscure unsavory items.    I like her break down of chapters with different themes such as make your own takeout; she delivers a plan for starter, main dish, side or dessert. It all goes together beautifully, but can be taken apart for mixing and matching with own ideas.    The book is easy to read and understand, the paper is nice and has a great feel in the hand. Very well and often used guide. I even take it to work sometimes, flip through it and find something I like, stop at the grocery store on my way home with the recipe ingredients in my head, get exactly what I need, and by the time I get home, it all gets put together efficiently with great results!    It also makes  a smart present, because this will appeal to everyone without being banal.	2005-10-01

They might not be your cup of tea, yes that's one thing, but I see these reviews coming from people who are all ready familiar with his work and continue to punish themselves somehow. <br /> <br />So anyhow, ramblings aside... <br /> <br />This was my first Laymon book I purchased and first book of his I read, and I was not disappointed. I managed to collect about 20 or so of his books, but I read them sparingly, stuff this good and crazy doesn't come often, and the man is no longer with us, so you can see if I'm saving him for special reads, then it musn't be so bad! <br /> <br />I like stories that take the main characters ( and its nice to have more than one good character, versus a solitary main person) and secludes them somehow from civilization and help and throws them in the middle of a quiet remote place. This book has two stories of a couple, Bert and Rick who go camping, never a good thing for any character in a Laymon book, he loves to kill em off and of Gillian who breaks to peoples homes when they are on vacation.  <br /> <br />Yes somehow these two remote stories come together as the couple and Gill get involved with some unstable and dangerous people who take pleasure in their pain. <br /> <br />Without any spoilers there wasn't one boring moment, and I read this into the wee hours of the night, maybe this stuff has glue on pages, because I couldn't put it down. <br /> <br />Haha, go get a cheap used copy, and have a blast!	2005-09-21

This simply is one of those delicious books, that you start reading, you gasp and ger upset at the bad guy, you want to cover your eyes when the characters you grow to like,  go into places they shouldn't and you know you cant put this down untill you read the end, just know that this is the first intallment of a trilogy.    The trilogy is composed of The Cellar, The Beast House and the Midnight tour. Make sure you read it in the right order because it builds the layers of this creepy and totall grear book.    Yes theres death, blood, gore, explicit sex scenes  (other than the disturbing child molestation, probably necessaru to ultimately despise and wish death to the villan) and other stuff but thats the kind of book this is, and if it turns you on in any remote way give it a try.	2005-09-19

I have read all of his books in Polish, this one as well but this one somehow didn't cut it for me.  I don't think it was the language, although more formal and drier sounding than English, this book had some interesting typical European horror writer gore, sex and violence, which they love to pack on, but overall it was a major bore!    It went on and on and on about the family John, Leah, Sam, Sara and Ben and how they were terrified in their new home; ironically the house # was a 13. It had some interesting potential with the husband having an affair with Ruth, a coworker and Leah being unhappily married to him, and how the lives of those women and his children were on a toad to catastrophe, but the book kept veering off to the creepy house, which was modern, but evil.  The family felt sick and scared and had nightmares, but very vaguely described; yeah, that written over and over on every other page can drive anyone nuts.    I skipped it 100 short of being done with it and threw it in the trash. I just had no use for it, and it wasn't in English, what the heck would I do with it here. This must be the first book I tossed, actually Kay Hooper's \\"Touching Evil\\" was by far the worst story out there, and it was friends so I didn't torch it, yet yes, I threw this one out. : (    I skipped to the end to somehow see if I should keep reading it, and once I read the last page, I had no interest left in it. Big ole slice of bore!     Smith is usually gory and good, but he missed with this one. It reads more like a rough draft than a juicy book. I might be 24 but I'm not wasting my life on dry books.    --added---    I think this book hates me, I have just reviewed it and was looking at other Smith books I had on my shelf, and what do I find? A second copy of Phobia. Yes, oficially creepy....lol	2005-09-14

I got this paperback a few years ago in Poland, where I browse used books, and where I discovered a ton of great horror writers, and my favorite of them all; Graham Masterton. <br /> <br />Fungus is a fast read. Reading it made me appreciate the clean and safety of my New York City apartment, despite of terrorist threats, cockroaches and my cats yakking up surprises here and there.  <br /> <br />Basic synopsis; some lab experiments that make simple fungi reproduce and grow on a massive rate and take over London.  <br /> <br />The color, texture, array and lightning speed of contamination of the super strong fungi is too much for people living there, and they are either killed (as when they contract it form air, food or water) depending on the kind of fungus they got, it will either blow up from their stomach or mutate them into a walking mushroom, and make them loose all sense of humanity sooner or later. <br /> <br />It's all up to a bitter writer, whose ex wife was the scientist screwing it all up, and a team of other scientists to save what's left of their country before it's blown to bits by the govt. <br /> <br />Great read really, if you can get your hands on. Despite it all being about science and fungus, it didn't have one boring moment. Kinda reminds me of a Zombie movie here and there, even tho it's a book, because the mutated people were going crazy and hunting those who haven't changed. I had a marvelous time reading it.	2005-09-14

Imagine the cartons of Ben and Jerry's ice cream art on the pages on this book! Bright, colorful, cute, cozy and funny! <br /> <br />The book starts off with the general history of how the guys came together to bring us what we today know as Ben and Jerry's ice cream. <br /> <br />They give you a few easy ice cream bases to follow, giving you a choice of how creamy and rich you want it to a less filling and figure friendly versions.  <br /> <br />Ok, here's the best part; you can make most of the recipes using one of the base recipes, and then pick your favorite page, and drop designated ingredients in. It gives me a great opportunity to customize their crazy concoctions! <br /> <br />Tonight I made two recipes from the book, pumpkin ice cream and plum ice cream, but managed to change them easy into Pumpkin with toasted Hazelnuts and Plum, walnut and shaved chocolate ice cream. Their recipes are fool proof, fun and come out fantastic. Besides you can add whatever combinations your heart desires, you won't find that option at any store! <br /> <br />Some of my favorite recipes from the book are; pumpkin ice cream, plum, kiwi, Banana fudge chunk, strawberry coconut, Fresh coffee, Maple walnut, cantaloupe and many more I can't wait to try out. In the end sections they also have recipes for sorbets, cookies, brownies and sauces, with ideas how to arrange the whole thing into a mouth watering creation.  <br /> <br />Great book, not expensive and trust me, looking at the recipes will get you into that kitchen weather you have an ice cream maker or not!	2005-09-05

Wowee wowzers wow. <br />If you love juicy books that keep you up all night reading,  then Laymon is the way to go! <br /> <br />Lana, Angela, Doris, Howard, Keith and Glen set out on an expedition 500 miles away from their homes, looking for a treasure promised to them by Butler, a spirit they contact on their end of school year summer party, through an Ouija board. <br /> <br />I love how Laymon can have 6 characters, who are all different from each other, who's names you actually remember and who you begin to care for. I have read way too many books with one dimensional characters who's name escaped me after 5 minutes.  <br /> <br />This book kept me glued to its pages till 2 am every night, for four nights. <br />The kids set out on their trip to Calamity peak, soon to be followed by their teacher, the owner of the board and her lover. Now if you have ever had experience with Laymon and his \\"lost in the woods\\" type books, this is a gem! Nothings scarier than dark quiet thousands of forest miles, with random scary characters only he can create. <br /> <br />They are soon confronted with the local madman, but they do not stop on their pursuit of the treasure. So far all the clues they got from Butler were true so they do not stop. <br /> <br />Other than the madman and the vast space they travel through, the characters are involved in their own romantic situations, and Laymon does his usual job with the teenager raging hormones. Maybe bit too much sex stuff for my taste, but didn't spoil the book for me at all. <br /> <br />I absolutely loved the gory ending, It was extremely intense, just when you felt all was good and safe, the cold nasty dread creped up and took it all away!! I cant stop thinking about it, I love how good books end up with a great ending. No disappointment there! <br /> <br />Overall a great read, the 400 pages breeze buy in this captivating and hellowa juicy book!	2005-08-24

I was thinking up of any excuse, including housework and going to sleep early or staring through the window on the bus way home, anything but reading this horrid book. <br /> <br />I think it had too many characters, they sounded forced and fabricated,  it was dragging on, and when I flipped through it to read random paragraphs it all read so lukewarm. I felt like I was eating stale bread, and I like juicy good books, so this one went back on the shelf.  <br /> <br />Too bad, I liked the concept, and the recipe on the back was better than the book itself. <br /> <br />Major disappointment there, don't know if I would tackle Bishop's other books.	2005-08-19

Who knew that invention (the long time it really took) to popularize soap meant end of many plagues and common reasons why people lived do short. <br /> <br />Now you will know many fun facts too.

It was good, don't get my wrong, and I will always love Preston and Child, but I felt like the creatures were hidden and kept from the reader for the most part, and only peaked out at the end.  <br /> <br />Living in NYC and taking the train daily, was quite and experience while reading this book. The descriptions of the underground \\"mole\\" people and unknown to us levels reaching 30 stories below street level, was by far something one might not be educated about, even though it exists below my own two feet! <br /> <br />If  I was new to Preston and Childs books, I would not have started off with this one, because it might discourage future reading, to the impatient ones. <br /> <br />Overall this was a good book, with solid characters, charming Pendergast, crazy  adventures in the dark and stinky underground, but I wish, I could have read more about the Wrinklers, because I felt like the were kept away for the most part. <br /> <br />Good ending, but quick!	2005-07-08

The story somehow stuck in my mind, the creepy cover haunted my memory. <br /> <br />After reading more grown up stuff for  the past years, I felt like I had to lower my thinking a bit to get into this teenage world, but I have enjoyed the story once again. <br /> <br />Trish is being stalked by a man with a thousand faces, and she isn't safe anywhere, even in her own head. The mall, a place of fun and games is suddenly a maze of deadly possibilities, and chased by a madman, real or not, is quite a scary ride. <br /> <br />Very good book, for any age! Enjoy	2005-05-16

It took me very long to finally get through it, after deciding that I hate it and wont finish a bunch of times (reader's guilt inside me wouldn't let me give up, I hate not finishing a book) so I managed to finally read it. <br /> <br />There are too many 1 dimensional characters in it. They are flat, hard to like and do not stick in memory. She didn't even take her time to properly describe what they looked <br />Like. Half way through the book, I was trying hard to remember who was who, and what part they played in this lame story. I finally got them down by the end of the book. <br /> <br />The story reads like a lukewarm romance novel with very unrealistic ending. Nothing literally happened for the first 280 pages. The writer tried to portray the \\"evil\\" confusing the reader , weaving traces of magic and fantasy into it, about the identity of the killer. <br /> <br />The ending really pissed me off. The thought that I spent all this time, trying to give this book a chance, with this LAME sizzle of a climax was enough for me to hurl this book across the room and then out the window. I couldn't do that however, it wasn't mine. <br /> <br />No wonder my friend tried to give it away, maybe she was mad at me, haha <br /> <br /> <br />All in all, I haven't written a bad book review yet, so this was bad enough to make me do it. To all who loved it, glad you did, I however cannot comprehend how that's possible.	2005-05-05

Having just finished reading this gem of a book, I can sit back and reflect on the delicious story I have been privileged to be woven through. <br /> <br />Funny how this book seems personal on a few levels, first of all I do live in NYC blocks away from the Museum of Natural History, my favorite museum since childhood, I took a day off from work just to sit back and finish this book, as one reviewer below said one might have to do, I discovered that a woman I work with has the last name of Pendergast, and the climax of the story felt like a special treat, since its my birthday; right now. <br /> <br />And about the book; <br />Considering how many books are being written and published, this story was fresh, creepy, had totally amazing characters; I think I will miss them, and might have to re-read some of these books, to get back in touch with them(Pendergast, Smithback), and I wasn't feeling like I was just sitting here reading a BOOK. I felt like I was there or here rather, in NY, with this scary secretive thing going on. <br /> <br />The writers have done a fantastic job, because this feels real and surreal at the same time, its part Indian Jones, part Anatomy 101, part hide and seek and pray you're not found by the psycho killer, and part unraveling mystery that you have to sit back and get sucked into. Enjoy the ride, it's a heart pounding, fast and not nearly long enough for me! I feel sad having come to the end, but I will always look back on this story and remember how much pleasure I got from reading it and making it come alive in my head. <br /> <br />Okay, I am done before the worlds smallest violin starts playing on my shoulder, ha-ha, enjoy!	2005-03-30

Unimaginable things happened when she touches a coin, provided by the missing  man's girlfriend as Charlotte plunges into dangerous worlds, and instead of running away she runs head into the storm of what she unleashed with her special gift. <br /> <br />Very brave character, lovable sidekick, and plenty of supernatural sparks that kept my sitting up in my bed at night reading, or missing my buss stop on my way to work, simply because I was so engrossed in the story. <br /> <br />This book has a very rewarding ending. It's like being hungry for a century and then being presented with a heavenly feast. <br />I think anyone who picks this up, will be up for a nice ride, just don't forget to go to work......this book IS engrossing.	2005-03-22

This book is a blessing. For a long time I would have to hunt down the recopies on the food network website, print them, lose half of them, etc. This way I have it all in a beautiful glossy hard cover book, written with warmth, personal stories and mouth watering pictures of the dishes.  <br />I have made many of the dishes she features in her book, and not one turned out badly. It all comes out exactly as it's supposed to. That's tricky with some cookbooks, when you just can't get it to be what it's meant to be. Giada's book is divided in these sections: <br /> <br />Antipasti, Sauces, Pasta Polenta and Risotto, Entrees, Contorini (Side Dishes) and Dolci (Desserts) <br />  <br /> <br />Some of my favorite recipes I've made are: <br />Stuffed mushrooms: thank goodness they are so simple to make, because I am being hounded by my boyfriend to make them. Simply amazing. <br /> <br />Simple Bolognese- meaty, fresh, and satisfying, plus you don't have to wonder what was in it. You made it and you know it's clean. Classic recipe that's easy to follow. <br /> <br />Brown Butter sauce - I can still close my eyes and taste the sage and butter, over any meat. Instant dress up to any meal. <br /> <br />Chicken piccata - light, lemony, olivey, simply fantastic.  <br /> <br />I can just go on and on, but I don't want to bore anyone. This book is simply super. I don't mind the pictures of her, and if she changed her clothes for every single photo in the book, I would have mistaken it for a Vogue shoot, instead of a cookbook. <br /> <br />Hope you can enjoy it as much as I am.

Each one is different and unique, during hard times through out the book, the flashbacks show us their funny adventures at school, dating, trips, etc and make us root for them.  <br /> <br />This is one of those \\"lost in the woods\\" type of story, which I am beginning to like in scarry books. The girls are all alone, or so they think in a lodge in the middle of nowhere, when things start to happen. I do not wish to spoil anything, but let me tell ya, things arent what they seem, and there were a few twists and surprises. <br /> <br />Even though the whole book was really \\"meaty\\" with good material, I totally loved the ending. Endings are hard to write, and I have been unimpressed or dissapointed way too many times with books. The end was scarry, they were expecting something, and waititng for it almost gave me a heart attack. <br /> <br />Great read, although lenghty, over 450 pgs, but nothereless doesnt drag.	2004-12-01

It's a solid Cornwell novel. And please, as much as I love medicine and pathology novels, it's nice to see the Medical examiner snoop around, and do stuff, rather than sit in the lab all day. <br />I wish the ending was longer, because the whole story was pretty heavy duty. I like to see the whole action unfold even more.<br />Overall, another great read, dont miss it. Not to give things away, but the murderer isn't caugh on pure luck, as someone said below.

Maybe it was the cover, staring at me, but it must have been faith.<br />This is a wonderful book, with characters so witty, funny, sad, whom made me laugh so hard, that I had tears in my eyes (especially Tara's visit to the spa, page 300, that had me howling in laughter to the point where I thought I was going to choke) and Katherine's cold and evil looks she gave men, that made them want to run away crying, Fintan was the character who brought them all together and changed their lives radically.<br />This is a phenomenal read that made me truly sad when it was over. Read it, you'll love it, even if this usually isn't your cup of tea.<br />Cheers,	2004-05-06

He is pretty consistent with his writing.<br />That aside, this was a good book. I am not sure why it's titled as such, but I liked how the stories of the family in Los Angeles and of Eduardo on Quatermass ranch, got brought together in the middle, only to finish in an explosive end. Without giving the plot away, and writing yet another summary, I liked this book for a few simple reasons;<br />- The main characters, Jack and his family are really likable. They are storing people, and I found myself reading thoughts they expressed, and feeling that I feel the same way about things in life.<BR>- Eduardo is an older man, living alone on Quatermass ranch, far away from any cities or people, and he discovers creepy things. Animals around him acting weird, dirt and stench in his house, scary pulsating and noises that grows stronger and stronger. <br />It was hard to read it at night, because the old man was alone, and I literally had to remember to breather when he kept discovering things. Good read after all, another nice book form Koontz.<br />I only with the ending was longer, in so many Koontz books, the fight up the hill gets to a dramatic climax only to let go and end very quickly on a page or two.<BR>-	2004-04-12

The book was good but the writing style is definatelly different. Since V.C Andrews passed away her family has been writing the books and they're almost like a sugar substitute for the real thing. Sweet but not quite there. She gave more depth, the houses were more descriptive and the evil sisters, cousins, mommas, grannys etc, were REAL bitchy. .Heavem series were my absolute favorite, the poverty, loss, fear, frustration and pain were very real, and they made for a tantalizing read.<BR>All in it's time I suppose. I also loved Ruby and the Flowers in the attic ... Great books for those cold snowy winter days!	2003-12-31
US	49654426	R2HWNUOANSTFBO	0425104346	485108045	Darkfall	Books	3	4	6	N	Y	Not the best	This is the first Koontz book that didnt get 5 starts from me. It took me a month to read it, and it usually takes me a few days. <BR>Jack Dawson is one character that you root for no matter what, funny, caring and smart. Rebecca, his partner is nasty, annoying and two dimentional. I couldnt stand her through the entire story. <BR>The voodoo aspect of it wasn't horribly scary, maybe only because the &quot;evil&quot; could always find it's victim. There was no where to run.<BR>THe end is a typical Koontz, end. Wham bam thank you maam. Quick and painless, but this one was just too smooth.<BR>Overall not a bad read, but I dont think this book HAD to be written.	2003-07-21
US	49654426	R273GTV0WN7UVF	0553582925	199284738	Tick Tock	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Not 2 shabby	Only one major con: Tommy was one of the most boring characters invented by Koontz. His mother, Del, and even the dog were more lively. Del was crazy, saying odd things ( things I say all the time in fact), but I found her to be similar to myself, well, except for when we find out more about her at the end, and you won't believe this one!<BR>The evil thing chasing them is very interesting, I must say. No one knows who it is or why it's so determined to whipe Tommy and his companions of this planet.<BR>The jokes and the stunts are worth reading this book. <BR>This reads different from most Koontz books, it's like a musical version of Xena, some laughs and costumes thrown in, but sit back, and buckle you'r seat belt. It's a bumpy ride.	2003-06-09

It is so much better than the movie. It literally gave me the chills! <BR>I was freaking out while reading, I was constanly worried for our good guy, that he will get caught by Annie, while he was out trying ot escape out of her house. When he doesn't want to do what she says, she finds wuite horrible ways to make him listen.<BR>Total page turner, and impossible to put down. For those who find King to be a bit hard to get into, this book is smooth as butter, and reads like a dream. <BR>Scary but good!!!	2003-06-04

He recipies are unusual but not hard to make, and always work out! I haven't made one thing yet, that wasn't perfect.<BR>I love the Baci ice cream, Chicken and Cashew nut curry is easy, but tastes like India. Crispy Lamb Chops are coated with parmesan, what a fun twist, and the Ultimate Greek Salad, makes me feel like I'm in Santori, looking out at the lazure waters.<br />This book is great, because it has so many chapters and so many different cultures in it , that it's impossible to exhaust the endless array of rainbow flavored recipies.<BR>Totally worth your bucks!	2003-06-04
US	49654426	R3K9STS16F2TWE	0425132951	117838793	The House of Thunder	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Thunder of scares and fun, this was a great read!	For those who are Koontz fans and even those who have never heard of him ( is that's even possible although he's been sucking the last few years a bit) this can be a real treat. This is one of his older novels which I prefer, his good olden days were something to relish in story land. I love how The House of Thunder really messes with the reader's mind when things start to unfold. It gets nice and creepy and brings in the thrills, I read this story years ago back in 2003 and I wanted to add a review to Goodreads so I looked up the old review and implemented some into this intro. I still think fondly of this story ten years later, time for a re-read it seems.<br /><br />When Susan wakes up in an unfamiliar hospital she knows there was some kind of an accident but she cannot recall what is going on and why is she there. Her freedom seems suppressed by mysterious hospital members and nurses, she starts suspecting something strange is going on around her and she's somehow aware of it without others noticing it, yet...Reading this as a surprise without reading about it was the best so I don't want to spoil but let me just say that it's seat gripping and fun, a type of book that will make one hold their breath, well at least I did, that one scene in the hospital..  yikes. She feels that her life is in danger even while everything seems pretty normal, she must do her best to remain inconspicuous but get to the bottom of things and still get out in one piece. Susan Thornton is one character that I grew to like, and I didn't want anything to happen to her. Unfortunately for me and for Susan, there are a few nice scary chapters with her in them, it was an intense read! Just when you think she's safe, she ends up in a much worse situation.<br /><br />This is a seep clogger, something that I read through the night and went on with the next day in a zombie haze because I was so tired but happy and rethinking the story in my head. So if you want to stay up till 3am go for it.<br/><br />- Kasia S.	2003-06-03

Quirky, funny and fast moving, with a bit of revolting sense of humor on part of Petra's eatting habits, this is a good fast read, that will satisfy those who love mysteries, and those who enjoy a bit of a good humor now and then.<BR>The only draw back is the amount of characters introduced. I had a bit of a hard time remembering who's who, but once I got into the story it all made sense.<BR>I appreciated the fact that by the time the book ended and the guilty was revealed I wasn't saying &quot;who's that?&quot;<br />Great read, M.C Beaton fans must dive into this one.	2003-05-25

This book will always feel different to me, because when I was reading it I was on the subway, on september 11th, 2001, when I heard what happened to the World Trade Center...That and the fact how good it was, makes it more than a book for me, it's a real memory.<BR>The story is sad and scary, about the simple act of a bit of uncooked hamburger that can deteriorate a percious life away. Robin Cook has a way of making us like the main character, and really feel for them, bond with them. He also makes them go and do their own CIA work, spying and dressing up, getting fake jobs and identities to seek out justice. Very good story, a must for any Robin Cook fan.	2003-05-19

The suspence and the weird accounts with the evil enemy were scary.I was expecting at any time something was going to pop up and envelop everyone.<BR>The cool thing about this book is the constant leve of suspence, there was no time that i felt relaxed while reading it, i was constantly thinking that something was going to happen, and it did, a lot! One of Koontz's best works. But the cover fooled me a bit, i thought it had to do something with Phantoms in the water, i guess the misty mountains were confusing to me, lol. Enjoy!	2003-03-01

Jack is a lovable character, and one roots for him, through this weird ordeal he got himself into. The enemy is hard to evade, since it can be invisible, unless it forms into a big black swarm. It's kinda like the 1986 Chernobly accident, the invisible radioactive rays that killed so many people. The silent and invisible enemy!

I dunno what he was smoking when he read the book, and wrote such negative comments, about such an intense book.<BR> Please, how pathetic. If i havent have read this book first, and used his review to judge it, id miss out on one of the best books ever! And besides his review, was longer , more boring and annoying that the supposed \\"100 pages that it took Chyna to get out of the chains\\" that he so nicely gave away.<br />The title summes it up pretty well. I read this book in 5 days, and every night i said \\"just a few more pages \\" (i said the same thing reading Watchers -love that book) and as usual i was up till 3 am, unable to stop. <BR>I was nervous of when Chyna and the villain, Vess would finally meet, and then i was nervous at the end for her. Omg, i dont want to give anything away, but this is a must read for anyone who likes good books.

I am not the worlds biggest dog fan, but i came to love that dog in the story and i couldnt get enough of it. I felt sad and happy reading it, i even felt sad for The Outsider. His obsession with Mickey Mouse was almost cute, when his cave was found, with the folded blanket, and those little ornaments, i felt sorrow and pity for the creature. I dont want to give the story away, like some other readers had, so i minght sound ambiguous for now.<BR>And when i read the sentence \\"Fiddle broken.

The creativity, the heart and wonderful story telling is his strong side, a pure natural talent that needs to continue. My books shelves are now filled with Mr.Koontz and it's definitely a good sight to behold.    When Hilary Thomas is attacked by a huge man named Bruno Frye she fights back the best she can only to discover that he's no regular burglar. Bruno is a twisted and delusional man with a secret past that has somehow tangled Hilary with it. He is convinced that she is someone who means him harm even though she doesn't even know him. The mad tale of deception and fight of brawn against muscle begins. The entire tale was very entertaining and I feel that with time Koontz will really take his stories and master his delivery. The ending came a bit fast after such a build up but it was out fantastic. When Hilary thinks she has gotten rid of Bruno he comes back from another world, confusing her senses of reality and the thin line between life and death that somehow got crossed...    - Kasia S.	2002-11-14
