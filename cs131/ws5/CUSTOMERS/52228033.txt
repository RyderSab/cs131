US	52228033	R2JTVP70WYN2HW	1563382873	916292030	Choices at the Heart of Technology: A Christian Perspective (Christian Mission & Modern Culture)	Books	1	3	6	N	N	Radical and Misguided	In the preface, the author mentions that religion has been banished to the backwater of modern culture by modern culture.  Hmm... not the most positive of perceptions.  I disagree with this statement as many regions of the world are seeing a rise in the interest of religion.  Since she is from England, I understand why she feels this way as interest in religion has been on the decline in Europe.  Next.<br />The book quickly sinks into a tiring diatribe that sounds rather adolescent.  Modern culture and technological improvements are to blame for everything from women being ignored, to poverty, to ruining planet earth etc.<br />I am certainly not disagreeing that technology has been overrated in our society and that at times more harm than good has been done.  But certainly the author can do better than come up with examples such as people listen to CD's now rather than going to concerts and that CD player is a problem because people aren't interacting with each other.  Dear author, why not have friends over while you listen to your CD's?  Another odd example is that she mentions that lines at ATM's are longer than the lines used to be inside the bank and she makes it seem that ATM's have brought on more problems than convenience.  So I guess the author would prefer that we go into the bank on our lunch hour so we can stand in line and converse with people in line and the teller for a moment rather than going to lunch with our co-workers and going to the ATM after work?!<br />The Internet is given time to of course.  Oh by the way, if the Internet was designed by women rather than men, it would be so much more positive and rather than pornography and abusive messages and shoot-em up games, it would have information about health and local events for women so they don't seem so isolated.<br />The author also quotes from sources who are neo-Luddites - broadly speaking people who oppose technological change or one of a group of early 19th century English workmen destroying labor-saving machinery in protest.  Doesn't sound like a Christian approach to me.<br />The problem I have with this book is that the author thinks she represents the Christian perspective.  I think it is more accurate to say that she is simply redirecting anger back at &quot;moderns&quot; because some of them have chastized her for her Christian beliefs.  I don't know where the negative attitude toward men comes from.  I was hoping for a more balanced and mature perspective.	2001-01-24

I am most interested in books about the Bible that are responsible and scholarly without preconceived ideals and theological agendas.  I am not interested in books that make odd claims for shock value or that go out of their way to try and break new ground.  This book delivered what I was looking for better than any other I have read so far.<br />This book which was originally written in German and translated to English provides the layman with fascinating insights which are responsible and scholarly.  One such example is the observation that many ancient traditions included written laws prior to the laws of Moses (designed to regulate the affairs of a society which usually involved denoting retaliation).  What was unique about the laws of Moses (i.e., the Ten Commandments) was not only &quot;You Shall have no Other Gods before Me&quot; but &quot;You Shall Love Your Neighbor as Yourself&quot; which has no other precedent in the laws of ancient religions.  You will also be treated to such wit and wisdom as &quot;... the first law of biblical criticism - speculation flourishes when facts are in short supply...&quot;<br />If you are looking for commentary, this is not the book for you.  You will be disappointed as the author only examines two of the five Books of Moses: Genesis and Exodus.  He indicates that the other three books of Moses primarily concern sacrifices, statistics, and long lists of place names and then he moves on to the Book of Joshua and the Conquest of Canaan.  This book is a reader meant for those who are interested in the highlights and fascinating insights about the Old and New Testaments that have been learned over the course of time.	2001-01-09

Perhaps you think you just don't &quot;get it&quot; or that there is something wrong with  you. Nothing could be further from the truth and this book will help you  realize that.<br />Most often, well meaning people just don't understand why  you don't see things their way!  Rather than suggesting alternative paths  they make you feel like there is something wrong with you since you don't  see things from their perspective.  You will learn that by and large, we  each have personality traits that explain our spiritual search.  This book  will help you analyze your traits and the common benefits or difficulties  of those traits.  You will learn about yourself and that your thougths are  quite common among many others who share your traits.<br />I would consider  this book a sleeper - I doubt it will get the attention it deserves.	2000-05-15

I can see where some may classify it as self-helpish, but that would be selling it short. It's interesting to read a book by an author that is interested in clearing the way for you to walk a spiritual path rather than pushing you down a particular road.<br />It was interesting to read about the experiences of others - told in a manner that was informative without going into lots of unnecessary detail. This book is probably most beneficial to those who are interested in looking into the various spiritual traditions, but are a bit apprehensive about where to start. It is also very open-ended so there is little talk of absolute this or that.<br />I also thought his synopsis of James Fowler's \\"Stages of Faith\\" was tremendous. Fowler's book is a tough read and McLennan's summary is clear and provides meaning. The book even includes a little humor near the end.<br />If you like this book and you are just starting out on your journey, you may also like \\"Come as You Are\\" by Betty Southard and Marita Littauer or for something more in-depth about each tradition Huston Smith's \\"The World's Religions\\" is highly acclaimed and deservedly so.	2000-05-11

Armstrong did her research which I expected (having read &quot;A History of God&quot;, I sensed she  would accomplish that) and she delivered interesting observations and a  wealth of history.  What was a pleasant surprise was that rather than  trying to 'fight' fundamentalism, she made a real effort to try to  'understand' it (unlike Bruce Bawer in &quot;Stealing Jesus&quot; whose  knowledge of fundamentalism history was unfortunately outdone by his  bitterness and intent to strike back).<br />The contrasting of the  fundamentalist perspective with the non-fundamentalist perspective was an  eye opener.  She points out the need for both meaning in life and reason.   The trouble with applying a literal understanding of the Scriptures was  discussed as well as the problem of relying upon 'reason' alone.<br />Even  though Armstrong's observations were not as exhaustive as the history she  describes, she gives you enough history to enable you to decipher and try  out some theories of your own.  Overall, I was much more impressed with  this work than &quot;A History of God&quot;.	2000-05-06

The author shares his experiences and is very practical in discussing what shame, forgiveness, and grace are and  aren't.<br />There are other popular books out there that discuss grace  (Amazing Grace by Philip Yancey, In the Grip of Grace by Max Lucado, and  The Ragamuffin Gospel by Brennan Manning) that are fine books in their own  right.  As fine as they are, this book starts with the problem of shame and  then walks you through to grace.  It just seems to be more complete than  giving you feel-good grace or trying to provide answers as to why the  church seems to lack it today.  This book just seems to be on a more  practical, personal level.	1999-12-02

The book delivers in many respects.  The history is fascinating.<br />What you will soon realize is that the editor  should have urged the author to stick to the history and leave his  bitterness and subjective thoughts out of the book.  At times the author  just gets into a downright 'rage' mostly about the unjust way that  homosexuality has been addressed in legalistic Christian churches.  Not  that I think he is wrong mind you (just ask a Baptist church that was  recently expelled by the SBC because it accepts gay members).  It is always  tragic when the church judges instead of extending compassion.<br />The  author's real purpose seemed to be to make a statement about the treatment  of gays in the church rather than to reveal an objective history of  Fundamentalism.  The injustice he has experienced is tragic, but to get on  a soapbox and judge all Fundamentalists as he does seems just as tragic as  his being judged.<br />If you would like an intersting perspective on what is  important, try Harold Kushner's 'When All You've Ever Wanted Isn't Enough'.   This may help you see spirituality in a light that has not been presented  to you before.	1999-11-18

I will not spoil the outcome for you, but it is an  outcome that many people who are monotheistic, agnostic or atheist  eventually discover as did Ecclesiastes.  The answer is applicable for any  generation.<br />Although written by a Rabbi, the wisdom in this book is  applicable to anyone of any belief. Although I don't believe that this is  Kushner's most popular book, it just might be his best.  He actually ends  up answering several questions rather than just THE ONE - this is  exceptional work.<br />As well written as the book was, the quality of the  printed book was awful.  It looked like the printer was short on ink and  many pages (not just 2 or 3) were tough to read primarily at the edges.   Since I generally rate a book based upon the author's work, I will give it  five stars and hope that the poor quality print of the book I had is an  isolated incident.	1999-11-01

The chapter on imaging God as monarch vs. compassionate was also excellent.   The chapter on salvation may be uneasy for some as it does depart from  dogma that is preached, but it will be interesting to those with an open  mind.  The chapter on social and political vision was a bit much - I think  the church has some work to do in compassion before attempts are made to  make it mainstream.<br />If you've had it with dogmatic messages and want to  be serious about your Christian beliefs, I believe this book will interest  you.	1999-10-19

It does however get bogged down into a longer than necessary prooftext against omnipotence.  What is a shame is the fact that I thought  Phillip Yancey's exploration and explanation in Disappointment With God on  the same subject was heartfelt and plausible.  The theory in this book  meanders a bit and is not as interesting and heartfelt.<br />I respect the  fact that it is virtually impossible to write a book on spirituality  without your own bias surfacing, but the author does seem to have a  works-oriented bias.  His criticism of Luther's &quot;Salvation exclusively  by  faith&quot; is perhaps among the oldest criticisms of faith in grace  and forgiveness vs. punishment and judgment.  If grace runs around loose we  fear some might take advantage of it and we won't have any reason to work  on our &quot;moral&quot; behavior.  This is the ever-present gray area of  Christianity.  I would love to see a book on this subject that addresses  this gray area head on.  For excellent books on grace, refer to Max Lucado,  Phillip Yancey, and Brennan Manning.<br />I will have to give the author  credit for a conclusion that is practical - whether you prefer it or not.   For a book on spirituality, that is not an easy task.  Then again, it sure  beats a lifetime of contemplation.	1999-07-08

I wish that the  author would have provided a more compelling reason for her conclusion on  the path she saw of most benefit - rather than simply providing a biased  justification by way of eliminating the other paths by way of her  displeasure with them.<br />Some interesting information gleaned from the book  was how enlightened you will be as to how many dead-ends you can encounter  when discussing/debating religion.
