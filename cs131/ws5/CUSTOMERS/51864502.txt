What to do, what to do?  Ah ha!, sez he, I shall convince them I am mad!  I shall convince them that I am like my old schoolmate Vaska Ryabuhin who was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic.  But I shall not do it all at once, they are on the lookout for this; instead I shall slowly develop my symptoms and really pull them in... <br /> <br />The plan works a little too well... <br /> <br />This is a very odd book, but, despite all that happens, an strangely joyful one.  Papdin has a grand eye for irony as well as for small details.  With a few words he creates the image of his horrible military camp in Siberia, the psychiatric ward he is placed in, and the constant inner turnings of his own mind.   <br /> <br />How much of this tale is real?  How much is imagined?  This would be difficult to tell.  Indeed this might all be the tale of a true madman.  In the end this doesn't matter.  Instead it is the kind of book that will make you laugh at doctors, military authorities, ridiculous lovers, slow bureaucracies, and the state of radio communications, all the time making you wonder whether the line between madness and sanity might be a little more permeable than you previously imagined.	2005-04-13

As an American medievalist with a love of the Anglo-Saxon era I jumped at the chance.  I had a chance there to see not only the resting place of Saint Cuthbert, but also The Vernerable Bede. <br /> <br />The Venerable Bede -- this is not a name, only an office.  What his actual name was we will probably never know, but that is less important than the historical narrative he has left us.  Having in mind to write a history of the English peoples, he goes on to write a work filled with wonders, colourful characters, foul villains, and ever and ever again, miracles.   <br /> <br />The Bede was an ecclesiast and saw all of history filtered through the glass of the Church.  Yet somehow he does not come off as \\"preachy\\" as many other historians of the time.  Maybe it is because of his deft characterizations, maybe his succinct view of the seemingly necessary course of history, but in any case I find myself caught up in a well-told tale, with morals attached. <br /> <br />By modern terms the Bede's work is one-sided and biased, and yet if you wish a true window into a world, it is best to have a guide.  The Bede gives us such a window, however imperfect, yet carefully and thoughtfully written.  To understand the northern English kingdoms of the early Middle Ages, one must consult the Bede; luckily, he is also a sympathetic fellow and draws us in, gently and knowingly, and offers us historical truths (especially close to his own time) as well as small sermons.   <br />	2004-10-21

To say this show was staggering is something of an understatement.  I have seen art shows on Magritte, Degas, Dali, Tutankhamen, the Celts, various Chinese exhibits and the like and I can say that this was probably my second favourite show, right after Treasures of Early Irish Art where I was able to see the Book of Kells, the Ardagh Chalice and the Tara Brooch. <br /> <br />Here was able to see works rather less known, but of such fascination and splendour that I have trouble trying to describe them.  Luckily, this book exists. <br /> <br />The book not only has marvelous colour photos of the items from the exhibit, including many detail plates, but also in situ photos, especially of Palanque, the primary focus of the exhibit.  On top of this the text of this book is incredibly helpful for those of us (most!) who know little or nothing of the various Mayan courts, their art, their mythology, and their history.  No, this is not a complete history, though there are many excellent books on that topic that have been written since the decoding of the Mayan language (especially since the great leap in understanding since the early 1980s).  Instead, this book provides basic understanding of the art and the context in which it was created. <br /> <br />This is a beautiful book, lovely to hold, well-bound, and full of great wonder.  To leaf through it is to glimpse through the smoking mirror of Mayan folklore, receiving prophetic statements not always clearly stated, but intriguing nonetheless.  To read the book is to glimpse behind that mirror and begin, somewhat, to understand a lost yet awesome culture.   <br /> <br />Look, read, enjoy.	2004-10-21

He also believes in dragons.  When it is proposed that he take a very long vacation (the University is thinking of getting rid of him due to his references to dragon hunting in the modern world), he is convinced, rather easily, to take five children along with him to help him in his collection of seaside specimens.  <br /> <br />From here on in is a lovely tale about overcoming fears, living up to one's potential, and, of course, the dragons that we all know really exist, whether they are the external, fire-breathing variety (none, sadly, actually show up in the book) or the internal, psychological ones (fear of the dark, being unsure that we are loved, etc.).  With great kindness, mild humour, and a love of language Felice Holman's book guides us along the way to acceptance of ourselves by ourselves (whether others do or not is entirely up to them). <br /> <br />Admittedly my review is coloured, doubly, by my memories of reading this as a child and, again, in reading it to my pseudo-niece and pseudo-nephew, but in passing on a wistful and important life lesson, I found that this book had lost none of its freshness, kindness, or gentle wisdom in the intervening (nearly) forty years.	2004-10-21

The problem is that both are terribly rare commodities.  Phil Rickman, I must take my hat off to you for handling both. <br /> <br />I have read books with characters who are admirable, heroic, likeable, believable, but that is not quite the same thing as realistic.  Take Merrily Watkins for an antidote, however.  Merrily is a very real woman.  She's 35, a widow, a vicar in the Anglican church, mother to a 15-year-old daughter (who is a delightful and exasperating handful herself), and struggling with a serious appointment in a very small town.  Yes, she smokes; yes, she swears now and again, but these are not affectations.  Instead, Merrily is a complex person, one with private inconsistencies that make sense as time goes by as well as deep truths that both drive and guide her.  Merrily is no superheroine, no master-of-all-situations, but rather a very real, very vulnerable, very tough, very reactive human being trying to make the best of the oddities life has thrown at her.  Sometimes she chooses brilliantly, sometimes not.  But when all is said and done, what actions she takes and what thoughts she has make sense for the person that she is.  She is not a character who serves a plot, but rather a person caught with words on a page.  Outside of \\"War & Peace\\" and \\"Crime & Punishment\\" I have not run across characters I love so deeply and react to on such an intense, human level as those created by Phil Rickman in this series. <br /> <br />Now on to horror... <br /> <br />Most \\"horror\\" writers use a lot of red ink.  Blood is everywhere, torture abounds, and even ghosts throw things about with alacrity.  In point of fact, most horror writers seem more interested in gross than in the tiny thrill of true horror, that moment when something is just a touch wrong, and you know it, but you cannot put your fingers on it, thus making it all the more terrifying for not being able to describeit.  Mr. Rickman, conversely, understands this true horror.  While many Big Things happen in this book, often the horror aspects are easily explained away -- a person with a psychological hang-up, a nasty public confrontation, someone fed a story about, say, rather nasty faeries in the apple grove at just the right/wrong time.  You never actually /see/ a ghost, but you feel them.  There is death and mayhem in this book, but that is not the real horror.  The horror is a combination of the all-too-human side of reality that people often wish to deny and the subtle, very, very subtle misplacement of the senses, especially of what Is and what Isn't. <br /> <br />Of the books in the series, I give this one 4 stars, although I would probably give 5 stars to the others.  There are a few times in this book that the writing weakens, leaving you to scratch your head for a moment or two over just which character is talking or exactly where the plot is heading, but then it gets back on track very strongly and directly.  The later books feel more comfortable, confident and controlled -- I wanted to rate this one because it is where people begin the series, though I may get around to the others as well.  In the end, this is very strong, very realistic writing and well worth the read. <br /> <br />Give it a try -- what could you possibly have to lose? <br />	2004-10-09
US	51864502	R29M1VUTRYE6H0	1899749306	307974809	Nobilis: The Game of Sovereign Powers	Books	5	46	49	N	N	Most provocative and imaginative game in a long age!	I have been playing rpgs since 1975.  In that time I've played OD&D (the Three Little Books that started it all), Traveller, RuneQuest, Paranoia, Metamorphosis Alpha, Chivalry & Sorcery, GURPS, Harmaster, Ars Magica, Champions, Golden Heroes, TORG, Castle Falkenstein, Werewolf, Mage, Star Trek, Over the Edge and a host of other games.  I got into gaming because of a twin love of storytelling and mythology/folklore.  While I have loved and questioned many games, this one has caught my imagination the most.  While it would be difficult to put together a game (see below), I have a deep and abiding love for the product and would wish to see it do well. <br /> <br />The game is based on the notion that the PCs are themselves demigods, powerful entities with near absolute control over some aspect of reality.  What aspect?  Well, it could be traffic.  Or it could be guns.  Or it could be the colour yellow.  Or it could be treachery.  Or you could incarnate (as showed up on the maillist) as the Power of Magnificence in the form of a weasel.   <br /> <br />Yes, this is an odd game.   <br /> <br />Within your sphere of influence, as I say, you have nearly complete power.  The problem, of course, is that no one is going to have utter dominance over all matters and, due to various reasons (hey! this is a roleplaying game!) there are many groups and individuals opposed to you and your boss, the greater being who acts as the nearly silent patron of the combined group of PCs.   <br /> <br />One of the biggest twists to this game, of course, is that no dice or cards are used as randomizing agents.  Instead you have a certain number of points each session you can use to \\"bid\\" in an effort to make certain events take place.  The GM also has these points, but in the end the feeling is not adversarial, but rather an attempt to create a larger myth, because sometimes the GM would use those points to bid up your efforts (or similar ones).  While I am not fully explaining the mechanics here (both for copyright reasons and space limitations), take my word for it that this is the only diceless/cardless system I have ever seen that both works and makes sense. <br /> <br />Now I said this would be a difficult game to put together.  Why so?  Well, you have to find just the right group of players and just the right GM similtaneously.  You have to have players who are less interested in gold, guns, and other objects and more interested in building a larger mythological framework to the game.  Equally you have to have a GM who is able to coherently come up with plots where, to use one negative reviewer's comment, an assault on the colour yellow makes sense.  I have run a couple short sessions of this game and the group has enjoyed it, been blown away by the possibilities.  We have not tried a full campaign yet, but it has been intense fun to date! <br /> <br />I must also give kudus to the \\"micro-fiction\\" in this game.  Scattered about on the pages are 1-2 paragraph snippets that overflow with ideas, much like the mini-stories from Italo Calvino's \\"Invisible Cities\\".  One has the devil worried he might not get it right when he has been given the burden of evil in the world, another has two men fighting over flowers, and another recounts the circular nature of all journeys.  I found these not only inspirational for this game, but actually serving as \\"whack to the side of the head\\" moments for life, other games, and how I did/wanted to view reality. <br /> <br />This game is about as imaginative and provocative as it gets.  No, it is not for everyone, but for the right person, this game is perfection itself.	2004-10-09

Give me Jules Verne, H. Rider Haggard, Arthur Conan Doyle, H.G. Wells and their ilk and I am quite the happy camper.  As such Space: 1889 well fills this need.  The pushing of The Great Game into outer space, replete with colonies, cloak & dagger work, army regiments, the raj-mentality (with all its pitfalls, questionable notions and nobility) are here, taken not just to Mars, but also to Mercury, Venus and the Moon.  With a bit of work, who knows?  Perhaps the very stars will eventually be available!   <br /> <br />For those who love this type of adventure, a touch of the movie \\"Zulu\\" meeting John Carter with a nod to 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, you will find all sorts of ideas to mine.  The Canal Martians, and then their less civilized brethren, provide exotic scenes, moral quandaries, wily enemies.  How \\"realistic\\" you play all of this is up to you, anything from a \\"Gandhi\\" tone to one of Pure Heroism. <br /> <br />The problem, however, is the system.  It is clunky, simplistic, and in the end quite broken.  In attempting to keep everything to d6 rolls, you end up with either binary results or the old \\"bucket load o' dice\\" scenario.  I have tried playing the system several times (at least three different GMs) and it has never felt satisfying.  On the other hand I ported the setting over to other systems (Harn, Over The Edge, BRP/Runequest/Call of Cthulhu, etc.) and found it worked emminently well!   <br /> <br />In the end, I would suggest this book as a supplement to anyone interested in roleplaying in this sort of era.  Ditch the system, keep the setting, and you will have a blast!	2004-09-16

Some of them you will find useful, others not so -- everyone's tastes differ, so what one person likes, others will loath.  One of the greatest problems I find is that the impact of many of the rules are not well thought out.  A prime example of this is the Vitality/Wound Points system (available as a free sample at the Wizards of the Coast site).  First of all, despite the promise of &quot;One Shot, One Kill&quot;, this is not at all the case -- a character may be reduced to 0 Wounds (never below this point), at which point you make rolls to /see/ if you are /dying/.  Nope, not dead, just potentially dying.  Equally, the W/VP rules make absolutely no reference to magic at all except in terms of healing.  Does this mean that magic never does Wound damage?  That it does it to a smaller extent?  If it can effect Wounds, is there a new limitation on how many dice may be rolled for a fireball or magic missile?  Many unanswered questions abound.  Conversely there is also a long discussion of Hexes vs. Squares for battle boards.  But why?  Is it so difficult to figure out the conversion of one set of space indicators to another?  Here authors go overboard with examples on something that is terribly simple to explain.  Then there are the Paragon Classes which are, to say generously, /borrowed/ from Monte Cooks &quot;Arcana Unearthed&quot;, but with the odd twist that you can be the Paragon of Half-Orcs or Half-Elves.  How does one become the Best of the Bloodline of a mixed bloodline?  This makes neither logical nor internal game sense.<br />Overall, like most of the 3.5 retool, I find the product overpriced, overhyped, and half-baked.  The print quality is good, the editing about on par with most gamebooks (a few glaring errors, but not as many as something from Mongoose), and the illos the standard mix of very good (insane wizard on p199) to vastly mediocre (human of brass dragon lineage on p22) to unintentionally comical (ambush on p212) to plain awful (decorated soldier on p183).  <br />Is it worth it?  <br />Depends on what you need.  If you are a completist, yes.  If you have no other source for ideas or are desperate to fit into a convetions rules, yes.  If you have access to the internet and can surf through a few D&amp;D sites, probably not -- you'll gain all of this material for free if you just look around a bit.	2004-02-22

On the other hand, if you saw the humour in The Onion's &quot;Our Dumb Century&quot;, you will probably find it here as well.<br />This book parodies the style, the language, and the look of all those posters of the WWII and McCarthy era that urged us to back our troops, save tin cans, and watch for Communists under our beds.  The target is now, quite obviously, the adventures of the Bush administration.  Personally I find Wright's style veyr humourous, albeit overstated.  Then again, given the level of public political discussion in this nation (Coulter, Savage, and O'Reilly representing the Right; Franken and Moore representing the Left) I think this book is fairly typical.  Reduce complex issues to a buzz phrase, go for graphics, make sweeping generalizations -- this is what passes for political discourse anymore.  If you can't sum up complex problems in 5 seconds and have someone say &quot;Ditto!&quot; to it, it is too long winded for many people's attention spans.<br />This is sad.<br />That having been said, Wright has done what the commentators on the Left of the political spectrum tend to do best of late:  skewer their political adversaries with humour.  It is very dark humour, very dark indeed.  Often this has been the recourse of the underdog at any period -- make the opposition look ridiculous and the whole dialectic changes.<br />This is not a book for the easily offended, but give it a thumb-through at your local bookstore.  <br />Personally, I am buying copies of it for three members of my family with senses of humour that fit with something like &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;.	2003-11-04

After writing &quot;The History of the Kings of Britain&quot; we have the explosion of works by Chretien de Troyes, Wolfram von Eschenbach, Marie de France, Gottfried von Strassburg, the Vulgate Cycle and all the rest, eventually culminating in the 15th century with Le Morte D'Arthur.  No matter what oral tradition may have been in place before this time (the &quot;little book&quot; loaned to Geoffrey?), this is THE book that starts the true interest in The Matter of Britain.<br />While King Arthur is the centerpiece of the work, this book contains many tales, many of which were later reworked by other authors, most notably Llyr (Lear) and his three daughters.<br />This book is not a history in the modern sense.  &quot;History&quot; derives from &quot;historia&quot;, a story, a tale; such &quot;historical&quot; stories were meant, first and foremost, to be moral, didactic lessons on how to (or how NOT to) conduct one's life.  Very little in this book could be construed by modern standards to be a &quot;true history&quot;; conversely, here are tales of nobility, gallantry, perfidy, excess, and the like.  The characters are exemplars, not real people.  The book, starting with the Fall of Troy, leads towards the glory of King Arthur and then falls away from this point, with the slow decline of the Britons in the face of the Anglo-Saxons.<br />This book is not an easy read by modern standards.  On the other hand, it was a medieval &quot;best seller&quot;, a book for which there are dozens of manuscripts to sort out (often with slight differences in the text).  If you have a real interest in the Arthurian legends or in medieval literature in general, you owe it to yourself to read this volume.  While the tales of the Mabinogian may be older, this is the spark-point that introduces Europe to King Arthur.	2003-07-07

This is where the fun comes in!<br />You see, you already know the tunes.<br />No!  Really!  This is Tuneswapping (trademark).<br />Each of the songs in this book can be sung to dozens of tunes, literally.  On pages 10-11 of this book there is a list of 100 song tunes, each tune fitting all the songs in the book.  Examples of the 100 songs listed are:  &quot;A Man of Constant Sorrow&quot;, &quot;Jingle Bells&quot;, &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot;, and &quot;You're in the Army Now&quot;.  Some of the tunes are current, some are old favourites, some are classic, some are obscure.  Best of all, there are several lines after the list to write in OTHER songs that also fit the tunes!  Go ahead!  Add to the fun!<br />Equally, there is space at the end of the book to add in new songs.  Go ahead!  Add even more fun!<br />So this is fun, wacky, wild, and easy to do.  Kids will love singing these songs; adults will find themselves drawn in.  Best of all there price is low, so the fun is easy to share!<br />Oh, and one last point:  Jack Davis, of MAD Magazine fame, has included lots of illustrations!  If you are a fan of his art, you will love this book!<br />So, go forth, join the Tuneswapping phenomenon, have a blast, and get vaguely in tune.  But don't worry too much about hitting exactly the right note -- this book is about fun and getting together more than being lead soloist on the chorus.  <br />Besides, everyone can at least get close to &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; ... or maybe &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot;...	2003-07-07

Peters marshals facts neatly, cleanly, and readably, seperating the facts from the fictions.  Tracing the notion of inquistion from its linguistic roots (inquire, inquest) all the way to the parodies of Monty Python and Mel Brooks, he shows how what we think of as THE INQUISITION is a composite of some historical fact and a lot of (truth to tell) whitewash and propoganda.<br />One of Peters' central arguments revolves around the printing press.  The moveable type printing press was developed in /northern/ Europe and, as the Protestant Reformation spread, so did the printing press -- primarily into Protestant lands.  Spain, the largest empire in Europe at the time, was also ardently Catholic.  The printing press was therefor enlisted as a propoganda tool.  Many lurid pamphlets, of at best questionable veracity, were spread by Protestants to show the levels of evil, the depravity to which the Spanish had sunk; Peters also points out how several of these same charges had been levelled against other groups both prior to Spain's rise and then later against new foes, but due to the new power of the written word, and the rise in literacy, the charges truly struck home.<br />On the other hand Peters does not shrink from the vile acts of the inquistion, Spanish or otherwise.  He points to the origins of what we now collectively recognize as \\"The Inquisition\\" during the 12th century, citings boths its powers and its limits.  He shows the later abuses, especially in Spain and the New World, including torture, forced conversions, endless imprisonments, and the rest.  He also is meticulous in pointing out the comparative small numbers of people these horrors were visited upon, as the inquisitions (yes, plural) tended to keep fairly tight records.<br />The last part of the book is probably the most interesting, because here Peters deals with the /idea/ of The Inquisition.  Based on the pamphlets of the 16th and 17th centuries, later writers grab up what has become a stock image.  The Gothic writers of the late 18th and early 19th centuries drive these fictionalized visions even deeper into the collective set of themes of European literature.  By the end of the 19th century and certainly in the 20th and 21st centuries, it is nearly impossible to erradicate the /vision/ of the Inquisition (NOBODY expects the Spanish Inquistion!) from the reality of the times.<br />No one wants a return of the inquistion.  Conversely, its excesses have been decried to the point of shrillness and amplified to a degree of groteque improbability.  Peters work is the single most solid, credible and even-handed works on the topic to date.  Unlike many other works that rely on secondary sources or the oft-repeated pamphlets of the Protestant north, Peters looks into papal records, notes from both sides, histories, diaries, letters, and all the minutiae that go into making a true historical and historilogical work.  On top over everything else, the work is neither dry nor dull -- it is a solid read for either the casual reader or the scholar.  I cannot help but recommend this volume to anyone who would like a better understanding of both the abuses and the truth behind the inquistion.h and 17th centuries, later writers grab up what has become a stock image.

When de Lint writes, you feel a strong tug at your deepest core; you know he is writing about a truth, even if you have yourself never seen balloon people -- they are true on a level beyond something seen on the news.<br />Many writers currently seem determined to make faeries and other magical creatures very nice, very sweet, and altogether sappy.  In these short stories we find nice creatures.  We also find not quite so nice ones.  We also find quite horrid ones, ones that would make our nightmares sit up and take notice.  We find here the wellspring for artistic inspiration and the black void that leads to drug overdoses, the spirit of freedom and the freedom that goes too far and leads to madness.  Here is hope, despair, and every other emotion, sometimes whispering, sometimes crying defiantly, but always with a sense that there is a truth here, no matter how much it may seem like a \\"mere fairy tale\\".<br />This is an important point -- de Lint is writing about reality, about real lives, about real feelings, about real emotions.  There is a touch of magic to this, from the woman who doesn't want to admit that she sees things others do not, to the man who falls too in love with a photograph.  What de Lint is writing about is what makes us ourselves, whether that is very good or very not good; he writes about fears, lusts, emotional expression, distrust, scams, and dozens of other human activities with a passion and an honesty that few can match or manage.  In the end these works may be seen as parables, as internal explanations, or almost anything else, but ultimately they are beautiful works, very poignant, and full of sadnss, beauty, joy, and fear.  They are raw expressions of all that happens in our world, coloured slightly by a dusting of the fey and the careful tread of a coyotein his moccasins.<br />Read, love, cry, and feel.	2003-02-25

While neither of these names come immediately to most people's minds, another name might -- Ishi.  Alfred Kroeber, as a professor of anthropology at Berkeley, was the man who wrote about Ishi, the last member of his native tribe.  While by some modern sensibilities Ishi was seen as mistreated, Alfred Kroeber's work with him allowed a vast store of native lore and knowledge to be preserved.  Alfred also worked very hard to bring a respect, knowledge and even admiration to the first peoples of California, a group often ignored because they fought no major wars and had, compared to the Plains, Mesa, Northwest Coast, and Woodland tribes, a very simple material culture; Alfred Kroeber tried to show that simple did not mean non-existent, and certainly not unimportant.<br />Theodora Kroeber worked in an area her husband, but not her daughter, overlooked -- the stories.  Her collection &quot;The Inland Whale&quot; is a wonderful and charming preservations of Pomo, Noyo, Nolo and other northern California tales.<br />Combine these influences with Ms. LeGuin's known stands on the environment, feminism, and the like, stir very, very gently, add people willing to work on music, language, and art and the result is &quot;Always Coming Home&quot;.  <br />The book is part anthropological/archaeological report, part recording of stories, and part cycle of life.  There is a strange and beautiful poetry to this work.  Consider the very first sentence:  &quot;The people in this book might be going to have lived a long, long time from now in Northern California.&quot;  I'm not sure how I would even begin to parse that sentence for translation, but there is something about the use of multiple tenses that sets the tone for the entire book.<br />Are there faults with this book?  Yes, certainly.  There are strong diatribes against machines and industrialization, yet the way of life of the Kesh is at least partially possible because of this technology, especially in communications (a standard trope in LeGuin's works -- ease of communications).  There is also a heavy handed way to pointing out males as the source of all conflict; I do find this annoying.  But these are comparatively small points in the book.  Read it first and foremost as a love letter to the land and her parents and you will find the joy, the hope and the heart of it all.	2003-02-24

They were very popular back in Victorian times but rather less so nowadays.  To many they seem contrived.  But consider this:  this is a novel set in the Victorian Age.  What better way to pay homage to the time then to attempt to copy the style and the verbage of that time?  This is one of the many glories, great and small, of this novel and I raise my glass to Brust and Bull for it.<br />The cast of the novel is fairly large by modern standards but much curtailed for Dickens and his ilk; there are essentially four main characters (James Cobham, a ex-Chartist part-time anarchist, Kitty Holbourn, devoutee of the arcane, Richard Cobham, James' cousin and erstwhile lover of Kitty, and Susan Voight, 'an houri in practical shoes and sensible stays').  The plot revolves around several points, but primarily it is a mystery -- James falls from a boat, is assumed drowned, and yet finds himself very much alive and working in an inn as a stablehand several months after the event.  <br />Working in and out from here are possible faery sightings, would-be Satanists, or at least individuals bent on human sacrifice, a possible government conspiracy, a traitor in the Chartist movement that may have led to the unravelling of the abortive revolutions of 1848, and even a wonderfully drawn appearance by Friedrich Engels.  The characterizations are sharp, the descriptions clear, the manners superb; I never heard a false note in the cadences of voice and manner through the book, no sense of the 20th century imposing itself on the 19th.  I ended up truly caring what happened to the characters and wondering what had happened to force them into their current horrible predicaments.<br />I can recommend this novel as a great fun read, a wild ride, and not a half-bad intro into certain aspect of the mid-19th century, at least as far as England is concerned.	2003-02-24

That being said, this is a grand book that has come to light in the face of great adversity.  Despite the destruction of many of his initial notes in a fire and despite his own untimely death, both his own research, his love of detail, and the kindness of his friends have surfaced in this volume.<br />The best book to compare this to is W.L. Warren's \\"Henry II\\".  Like that book, this is an attempt to get down in concrete fashion all the hard facts of an incredible monarch; in some ways Hollister is arguing against Warren in that Hollister is showing that many of the significant legal changes generally credited to Henry II, such as the expansion of circuit courts, actually had their origins during the reign of Henry I.  <br />This is a methodical work; it is not light reading nor is it meant to be.  It is, literally, the work of a lifetime, one historian's ode to a great figure from history.  Yet it is not truly a panagaeic either; Hollister shows Henry's warts as well as his glories.  The point is that in many ways this is Old School History.  It is about kings, courts, wars, laws, and all the rest.  It is not a stylish book with a lot of witty turns of phrase (though there are some).  First and foremost this is a book of careful argumentation, a book that pushes even more strongly than in the past C. Warren Hollister's unflagging belief in the 12th Century Renaissance.<br />Warren was a great and charming man, endlessly hospitable, always kind, and a man who had a true care for his students.  In each of them he planted a respect for documents -- how much can be inferred, more importantly how much cannot, how to honestly show what you have learned, and how to both back that up and prove it.  I know he would have wanted to clean up passages of this book, tighten his arguments here and there, add several more footnotes.  But it is because of the respect and love that Warren showed his many students, his family, that this book is here today.  <br />May this work serve as a fitting epitath to a great and generous heart, as well as to a fine historian.	2003-02-24

Moore has done a great disservice to historians and historiography with this volume.  He has made several broad assumptions regarding persecution, marginalizing of groups, and even the nature of illness.  On top of this he places late 20th century nurban expectations upon an earlier society.  <br />Moore is on fairly safe ground when he speaks of the marginalization of Jews during the Middle Ages -- this is well documented -- but he overstates his case.  His assertation that this practice only started in the Middle Ages is, however, rather off the mark.  Certainly we can read Roman authors (and edicts) which show active persecution of Jews.  But Moore tells us that it was only during the Middle Ages that organized persecution be minorities truly began; I am sure this is a great comfort of Christians persecuted since the 1st century A.D. within the confines of the Roman Empire.<br />When he turns to lepers he is on terribly dangerous ground and, indeed, utterly misinterprets evidence laid before his eyes.  As Moore points out there have been many studies that show that what was called \\"leprosy\\" during the Middle Ages was probably a wide range of both related and non-related illnesses, so we cannot equate it exactly with the modern disease; however it must also be remembered that germ theory did not exists until the 19th century.  What Moore tells us is that the creation of leper colonies during the Middle Ages is the moral equivalent to concentration camps in the 20th century.  Here are nobles, particularly noble women, who are forcing these \\"lepers\\" to live apart from society.  Thus nobles decide who is a leper and segregate them from society.  QED, a persecuting society.  Instead, from a medieval point of view, these nobles were providing a chance at life for individuals who were likely to die on their own because they had been shunned by their own families, due to some horrible, disfiguring disease.  What was in actuallity an example of good works and aid toone's fellow man is twisted by Moore into proto-Nazism.<br />Moore is a man who wants to answer a question -- why is their racism and when did it begin?  The problem is that by overstating his case and trying to suggest that only one area (Europe) at only one time (the 9th-12th centuries) are responsible for this phenomenon worldwide.  This, sadly, is not true.  People have been marginalized for their skin colour, their faith, their way of dress, or any of a host of other reasons practically since human beings emerged and certainly it is, again sadly, a world-wide phenomenon.  It would have been comforting to stick this label, but in doing so Moore is, in effect, guilty of exactly the same crime that he wishes to place on others -- marginaliztion of a group of people because they do not fit to his personal beliefs and standards.  Much as there was evil in medieval Europe, it is far from responsible for all the sins of the world.	2003-02-19

The first of the Dudley Pope &quot;Ramage&quot; series is not bad as an adventure-at-sea novel, but it is not great either.  It is fun, but not amazingly exciting.  Pope is knowledgable, but heavy-handed.  So the book rates 3 stars.<br />First some background.  I have read the Horatio Hornblower &amp; Aubrey/Maturin series, as well as a couple books by Kent, &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot;, and scattered other bits of nautical lore and adventure.  I enjoy the genre as a whole.  Thus at a friend's suggestion I picked up &quot;Ramage&quot;.<br />The action in this book can get pretty heavy, but often to the point of strained credulity.  As this is a historical novel, I don't really expect to see sections that strike me as &quot;What an AMAZING bit of luck!&quot; every 20-30 pages, but that does happen here.  Ramage begins his career (at least as far as the book is concerned) by coming back to consciousness after being knocked about by an explosion.  Luckily he has not noticable concussion...  He is the only officer left on board his ship.  Luckily he can find the captain's secret orders...  Luckily they directly involve skills he has...  And somehow he is able to convince his heavily battered crew that he is NOT abandoning them by leaving the ship in the ship's boats.  This is only the opening sequence, so I am not giving much away here.<br />His adventures take a much more believable turn on land and the pace really picks up; unfortunately things drag later during a courtmartial scene.  I want to get involved with the adventures and the excitement, but I keep thinking, &quot;How much blind luck can one fellow have?&quot;<br />Another disappointing aspect of the book revolves around the nautical lore.  It is always tricky as to how much to include in a given book and how to present it.  Patrick O'Brian was the great master of being able to spoon bits of knowledge of sailing vessels to his audience without making it seem like a long lecture.  Unfortunately Pope is much more heavy-handed in his approach.  When he wants to explain something about the management of ships, he very obviously places a non-naval person in the scene and then proceeds to have Ramage give a mini-lecture.  This is not only clunky in execution, it becomes woefully predictable.  The only time this didn't happen, Ramage thought all the steps out in his head, sort of like a Shakespearean soliloquy on naval maneuvers.<br />Ramage himself is a rather nice character, with some little quirks, an interesting background, and rather too much luck.  Gianna, his lady love, is a standard head strong young woman who comes to love the hero.  Jackson, Ramage's American sidekick, is also rather nice, but a little too Johnny-on-the-spot, as if all he is at times is an extension of Ramage's luck.<br />Pope knows the period very well.  He knows the sea, the commanders, the action, and the politics.  As this was his freshman effort I have every hope that the later books become less heavy-handed.  In the end &quot;Ramage&quot; is not a bad book, but it is not a great book of the genre either.aking it seem like a long lecture.  Unfortunately Pope is much more heavy-handed in his approach.

John Ford's book was the best thing to come along about Klingons until TNG, Marc Okrand, and later movies changed our image of them and their society.  In many ways, I still love this old school vision.<br />These are not the Klingons of Worf and Gowran.  Warriors names still all begin with the letter &quot;K&quot;.  Why?  Well, because that is how you know someone is in the Imperial Klingon Navy.  These Klingons are massively paranoid because the Imperial Intelligence Service pokes into every aspect of life, public and private.  Also quite importantly this is a society that thinks in binary terms.  There is &quot;komerex&quot; (that which grows, lives, expands, fights) and &quot;keterex&quot; (that which shrinks, dies, contracts, is defeated).  To be a true klingon means to fight and expand the empire.  A stable-state government is just not in the picture.<br />Captain Krenn, a klingon suddenly without a House, is sent to learn more about the latest adversaries of the Empire, the United Federation of Planets.  The humans make little sense to him and he is wary, but he is also wary of his own government -- he knows there is a plot afoot, one that he thinks is there to destroy him; on the other hand, it might just be a plot to start a war.  The komerez zha (the Klingon game, their &quot;equivalent to chess&quot;) is deadly and everyone plays.  Especially those who claim not to play.<br />No, this is not what the klingons are &quot;really like&quot; anymore.  I find that a pity as the book is intriguing.  But if you are a Trek fan, do yourself a favour and read this book with an open mind.  Maybe its another parallel universe, like the Mirror Universe we have seen in other episodes.<br />Or perhaps the komerex zha is still being played behind your backs.	2002-05-16

A parody is a dangerous thing to maintain.  Often you get caught in your own cleverness and lose steam (or lose your readers' interest).  Our Dumb Century has gone beyond all that.  Here is 20th century America skewered for all it is worth, leaving no shortcoming unnoticed, no historical event unmasked.<br />This book is not simply a &quot;goof&quot; on history.  The writers really know their stuff.  I mean REALLY know it.  Each entry is the &quot;front page&quot; of The Onion (gee, we never knew it was THIS venerable...) from the 1900 to 2000 (okay, it came out in 1999, but you can stretch things).  Not only are issues of the day dealt with in a hysterical manner (1955:  Whites Invent 'Rock and Roll' -- New Caucasian-Based Teen Craze Sweeps America; 1945:  WAR OVER!  50 YEARS OF NUCLEAR PARANOIA BEGIN TODAY!), but the typeface, the layouts of the pages, and the quality of the photos match the period.  Find an old newspaper.  Hold it up to the &quot;equivalent year&quot; in The Onion.  It is a match.  <br />Conservatives are blasted.  Liberals are skewered.  Apoliticals are tarred and feathered.  Everyone gets their due in this volume.<br />Worse yet, you might even get an education reading this book.  If nothing else you'll probably have to go look something up to just understand some of the jokes.  I know I did...	2002-05-16

When I pick a book up, I finish it.  I have tackled The Lord of the Rings, War &amp; Peace, the Aubrey/Mataurin series and many other long individual and series works.  I got two-thirds of the way through this book, went to my local used book store and sold it, never to look back.<br />Why?<br />Nothing happened.  In something like 300pp there were people running.  They started running.  Sometimes other groups of people who were also running joined them.  Then some of these split off to run somewhere else.  There was ever so much running.  There were a couple of battles, but I didn't know why.  I never saw the world because everyone was in such a hurry to get through it I could never see the trees for the forest.  I never got a sense of individual characters.  Mostly they were &quot;just human and scared&quot;.  I kept waiting for a hero to arrive and take the group (or whatever part of it remained on that page) by the hand and lead them somewhere, perhaps in the process letting me know /why/ everyone was running.<br />I was told by my friends that I should give the series a chance.  &quot;How much?&quot;  &quot;Oh, it really picks up in the third book.&quot;  <br />In one book of equal length (War &amp; Peace) I gained an understanding of the human condition in general and life in Russia during the Napoleonic Wars (filtered through the late 19th century); I learned of human goodness, human frailty, god, aetheism, mathematics, society, peasantry, and what it is like to LIVE.  In the Harry Potter book &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; (again nearly equal length) I learned about fear, heroism, honesty, choices, gut fears, and loyalty.  With many other books I have carried something away that lives in my heart.<br />With Jordan all I have is a desire to by cross-trainer shoes.	2002-04-25

I read through all three editions, but always found the game lacking.  The stories of the gods and heroes of Glorantha were always so much larger than a game where you are tramping around like a mercenary-scavenger struggling to get enough clacks to buy a brew.  So when Hero Wars was first being touted I was quite excited.  Finally a chance for the rpg to catch up with White Bear, Red Moon and Plains of Prax!<br />That was how I felt until I read through the game.<br />What I expected was a game that ignored the petty details of day-to-day life and went for the Grand Hero's Journey a la Joseph Campbell.  Instead our hero-to-be is just another member of his tribe.  Yes, finally you get to play someone actually out of Dragon Pass, and supposedly you are halfway to being a hero already, but the tone of the game is to fit into your culture, to deal with petty cattle raids, and to worry whether or not the crops will come in next year.<br />The system isn't too difficult to figure out ... after about a dozen reads.  As a veteran of reading many types of rpgs in my 25 years of playing, I found the layout and explanations very confusing.  The editing is attrocious.  There are tables that are split from bottom of one page to top of another.  As we are living in a day and age of on-screen editing and WYSIWYG word processing this is unforgivable.  Skills are often ill-defined, sometimes not defined at all (I am still waiting for the definition of the talent &quot;Snarl Darkness&quot;).  Yes, you can create skills off the top of your head, but you better have a group that is willing to put up with ill-defined talents.  Then again, since that seems to be the editorial style of this game, go for it.<br />The game sets up as many problems as it solves.  If your character is already a &quot;local hero&quot; why is it that Joe Nobody warriors (and most ordinary carnivores) will beat you up seven times out of ten?  If you are supposed to be a hero (again thinking of Campbell), why is he worried about getting his cattle in?  Where are the gods?  Where are the wonderous items?  <br />I look upon myself as the person this game was aimed for, someone with a strong interest in folklore/mythology, well-read in Glorantha, and disappointed with the limitations of RuneQuest.  Instead I am utterly turned off to this game and its few supplements.  Yes, the later supplements have improved in editing (I looked through them at a local game store, but refused to buy them on principle), but the basic game is poorly laid out, less &quot;user friendly&quot; for people not yet introduced to Glorantha, and far from clear in its focus.<br />Maybe someday a better version will be written.  <br />Maybe this better version will appear in less than 20 years.	2002-04-25

In other words, big books don't scare me, nor do long tales.<br />This said, I doubt I will follow up this series.  There is not inherently bad to AGOT.  The writing is decent, if not exciting (don't worry -- you will NEVER need a dictionary for this book).  The characters are fine as far as they go, but they tend to be archtypical rather than fully-drawn.  There are a LOT of characters, probably on par with a Charles Dickens novel, though none are as memorable with the possible exception of The Imp.  There is a grittiness to the book that is good in a world where we have had too many happy fantasy novels, but I'm not sure the author has done anything with this world /besides/ making it gritty.<br />The book (and probably the series) seems to be inspired by the Wars of the Roses.  Stark = York, Lannister = Lancaster, a shaky crown in jeopardy, arguements that go back over generations supposedly, but are primarily based on who-killed-whom-recently.  This is fine turf to start with.  G.G. Kay has done wonders with the history-disguised-as-fantasy style of writing; this book in no way compares, however, to Tigana or Lions of al-Rassan.  There is a lot of background history to AGOT, but it is handled in a clumsy manner -- a common ploy is to have two characters will suddenly start talking about past events even though the conversation has nothing to do with their previous conversation or actions.<br />AGOT is not bad.  It is far from brilliant.  It is an average book, just there is a lot to it.  This is a trend with a lot of fantasy (see Jordan & Rawn for other examples of more-must-be-better).  A long book can be a good book; so too can a short book.  There are a lot of /details/ in this book, but very little insight or weeding.  It is a long history...-soap-opera plot that says nothing higher than people can be very nasty to each other; in the end whoever wins the throne at the end of this series will be no better and no worse than those in the past, if the books background history is to be believed.

He has an eye for detail and an ear for a good story.  As such, his works combine many different elements -- travelogue, miracle tales, slander, complaints, and puffed-up pride.  I love him for all this; Gerald is a very real person, warts and all.<br />This book serves as a great introduction to medieval writing in many ways.  First of all, it is relatively short and is full chapers.  Each one could be read in connection with the others or solo.  One chapter might be about the lay of the land.  The next might have to do with a miraculous lake of birds.  The next might include scurulous reports about cannibalism.  This book, then, is not a history book, not a religious book, not a travelogue, but instead the notes and jottings of a mind interested in many topics.  While a lot of the writing speaks of God, Christ and miracles, not all of it does -- this will help give a general reader a broader understanding of the medieval world-view.<br />Give him a try.  You might find the Middle Ages a truly engaging time, a time when people, then as now, were people.	2002-04-19

This supplement goes a long way towards changing that and, I think, for the better.<br />There are a lot of &quot;crunchy bits&quot; in this supplement.  New Virtues, new Flaws, new types of magic, construction rules, the not-quite-familiars pahedros, etc.  Many players and storyguides will love it just for this, but do not stop there, please!  There are dozens of mystical organizations in this book, groups that can add wonder and, well, mysteries to your saga.<br />For all this praise, why not 5 stars?  Well, because this is not a supplement for beginners.  For the most part I recommend this supplement for those who have been playing Ars Magica for quite some time and feel they want a change, a rather serious change.  Equally there is NO WAY you can add all this material to a single saga.  Not only would it become confusing from a bookkeeping/logistical point of view, but also it would ultimately lead to the question of just how many magi can be in each of these lineages? just how many breakdowns are there in the Order of Hermes?  These are serious considerations in what is a very serious game.  <br />Bearing these points in mind, I think anyone truly interested in Ars Magica will find a lot of useable bits in The Mysteries.	2002-04-19

This one, sadly, falls into that category.  This is not a  /bad/ book, it is just not a terribly /good/ one.<br />Like many current works  pertaining to the tales of Arthur, this one is set nebulously in  &quot;historical times&quot;.  There are trappings to make it seem like  tale takes place just a bit after the Romans pull out of Britain, but only  hints.  There are a host of anachronisms which would not stand out if only  she had placed the tales outside of time, much as Sharan Newman did.  Of  history, there is little.  Of fantasy, there is little, also -- no dragons,  no magic, just a lot of very strong-willed and weak- willed people.  In  fact this is one of the problems -- her main characters cannot make up  their minds as to whether they are dynamic leaders or merely swept along by  events larger than themselves.  <br />Guenevere is neither a truly strong nor  engaging character.  At least half of her dialogue takes place in her head;  she seems incredibly reticent to speak her mind.  Her love for Arthur is  immediate and wholehearted, without any real reason.  She leads a group of  vague pagans who all worship The Mother, a wholy benign being who seems to  insist on a lot of sex, very little ceremony, and no strong thought other  than &quot;We Are Not Christian&quot;.  Apparently Guenevere should be a  warleader as well as a political leader for her people, yet despite the  fact that she is 20-odd years old when we first meet her, she has had no  training in battle.  On the other hand, she has an immediate grasp of  tactics the moment she views a battle.  <br />I rather like the fact that  Merlin is a dark character in this work -- so many Merlins since TH White  have been such nice, sanitized people that one forgets he was a figure of  mystery and even terror in the early legends, the product of a nun and a  demon.  On the other hand, his characterization is again rather shallow --  somehow he is connected to the Pendragon household and is determined to see  it continue in a position of power, but he has these visions of nubile  young things that taunt him in is unguarded moments.  Once he finds a  woman, he is imprisoned as a madman.  Poof.  End of Merlin.<br />I put this  book in the same rough category as Nancy McKenzie's &quot;Child  Queen&quot;, Joan Wolf's &quot;The Road to Avalon&quot;, and Helen  Hollick's &quot;Pendragon's Bannder series&quot; -- not bad, but not really  good.  If you are looking for a good version of the tales from a female  perspective, I heartily recommend either Vera Chapman or Fay Sampson.  Ms.  Miles' work is merely there, another novel that will go through a single  printing and be forgotten.	2000-08-04

On the Continent, however, he is considered a brilliant social commentator,  and biting satirist, AND a man who predicted the future.  This is a volume  that helps set matters to the right.<br />If you know of &quot;20,000  Leagues&quot; already, you will find little different at first.  The plot  is still the plot.  Nemo is still Nemo, Prof. Aronnax is still pompous and  fascinated by the Nautilus and Ned Land....<br />Ned Land is a flaming  socialist.<br />This is one of the major shifts between the original French  and the &quot;cleaned up&quot; English editions.  Most of the science of  the day was pulled out as a &quot;dull read&quot; and all the Socialism,  anti-English remarks, and other commentaries of a &quot;questionable  nature&quot; were excised.  We Americans have unfortunately been until only  very recently only able to find these poor early translations, or  translations based on these poor translations.  There is much more to Verne  than submarines and diving suits.  He is a man with a vision of his times,  both scientific and political, and his books underline this  strongly.<br />English readers, demand your Verne well-translated!  Do not  allow yourself to be fobbed off with bowlderized versions!  To be able to  read as he wrote himself (well, in English, for those of us who don't read  French...) is a greater pleasure than merely an amusing old science-fiction  story from the 19th century.  Reading this book, as Verne /meant/ it to be  read, if a pleasure, but also a struggle to understand ourselves and our  relationship to the oceans themselves.	2000-08-01

Yes, the information is good ... up to a point.  The problem is that in creating such broad portraits, the best you get is a  stereotyping of the era.  And as this volume is not graced by Angus  McBride's illustrations, it falls to a lower notch yet.<br />Venice was a  power in the Middle Ages and through part of the Renaissance.  Even when  dominated by foriegn powers, it was a player on the international scene,  especially when dealing with the crumbling remains of the Byzantine Empire.   This book does show that Venice was a force to be reckoned with;  unfortunately it is covering a period of over 450 years, so anything said  in the book must of needs be of a broad perspective.<br />Many people buy the  Men-at-Arms book strictly for the center colour illustrations (yes, I've  seen you, you fighters of the SCA!).  There is nothing at all wrong with  this.  I might warn a potential purchaser, however, that the illustrations  in this volume are rather flat and might not give you the wealth of detail  you might otherwise expect.  They are not /bad/, but sometimes the  proportions are a bit off, which might convince you to lenghthen a hauberk  where it is unnecessary.<br />I can only hope that Osprey will someday go back  and break up several of these &quot;long era&quot; books into smaller  chunks.  We would be far better served then.	2000-07-22

As you can tell by looking at the number on this one (50), this was one of the early efforts.  It really shows.<br />First of all, it should be noted that is  book covers the era 1300-1500 AD (approx.), so the earlier Middle Ages are  ignored entirely. It also relies heavily on Victorian era illustrations  (not for their central colour section, though) for many of the pictures --  this is very sad as most of these illustrations are woefully inaccurate.  The central colour illustrations are of a much higher caliber, but not up  to the current standards of the series.<br />The information falls into the  &quot;good enough&quot; category.  It's not that the information is  dreadfully wrong, it is just that it is woefully generalized and, by  current academic standards, rather antiquated.  The series as a whole has  done a fine job of late by focusing on smaller time periods and specific  nations (thus French Medieval Armies, 1000-1300, as an example) which far  supercede this volume.<br />If you are only going to have one volume on  medieval arms and armour, you could do worse than this book.  Then again,  you might just want to set your standards a tech higher...	2000-07-22

Still and all, the book does a fine job on illuminating one of  the darker eras of European history.  <br />David Nicolle does his best, as  always, at reading between the lines of chronicles, art, and many works  that were written well after the fact to try and peice together informaion  on this broad time period.  His notes on weapons, armour, and tactics are  very solid, not too far out on speculation, yet not so conservative to  stifle any real potentiallities.  &quot;Arthur&quot; himself makes only a  fleeting appearance in these pages, which is appropriate.<br />Angus McBride  (absolutely no relation) does his usual magnificent job of illustrating the  warriors of the era.  Not only does he show a fine sense of detail, but the  paintings are characters, not merely &quot;soldiers on parade&quot; -- each  of them is a unique individual and looks at home and quite comfortable (as  well as one can be) in the armour worn.	2000-07-22

This is one of the Men-at-Arms grabbag volumes.  While there are wonderful illustrations and lots of facts crammed in here, one has to wonder just how accurate a book covering warfare in approximately 1/2 of Europe over a 570  year period can be.  In the end, use this book as a jumping off point, but  not the last word on Eastern Europe.<br />The Angus McBride illustrations are  mostly up to their standards of excellence, although he has left the last  painting only partially done for some obscure reason and he DOES like to  focus on atypical arms and armour, which can be interesting, but also  presents a rather skewwed vision of the armies of the period.<br />Nicolle  tries valiantly with this volume.  As I said above, there are a LOT of  facts in here.  There are two problems that press on the information.  1)  Militarily, this is a poorly chronicled era and the sheer number of  languages makes the task all the more duanting and 2) the timeframe is just  far too broad for any serious considerations.  Imagine lumping all of, say,  American military developement from 1492 to the present (a similar  timeframe) into a volume this size and you will get a notion of the  enormity of the task.<br />The informaion is as good as the team can get it.   The illustrations do their best to bring a candle to the minds of Western  Europe and America as to what Eastern Europe went through.  The writing is  solid.  In the end, though, the book has severe limitations.  Take it with  a grain of salt.	2000-07-22

I read the English edition (pub. 1978) and couldn't get enough of it.  There are three novels in here, each retelling an aspect of the Arthurian legends from the perspective of one of the  female participants.  &quot;The Green Knight&quot; and &quot;King Arthur's  Daughter&quot; are both excellent stories, but it was &quot;The King's  Damosel&quot; that really blew me away.  Here is a re-telling of, and riff  on, the tale of Gareth Beaumains, in which he is harangued by one sister  and rescues another and marries.  But what of this second sister, Lynett?   Why did she have such an acid tongue?  And what became of her?  This tale  goes far to answer this and, more importantly, gives a strong female  character to the legends.  Amazingly, she is not a witch, a queen, or a  woman-hiding-as-knight.  Instead, she is a messenger, one who loyal serves  King Arthur, yet constantly stands against the limited role for women in  society and the assumptions laid upon them.  <br />Like so many books I have  read since MZB, this is what &quot;Mists of Avalon&quot; wanted to be, but  failed to produce, a true melding of the legends with a femnist slant, one  that is not discordanant, but rather is an improvement upon the old tales  well told.<br />If you can find this book, read it.	2000-07-21

If you read &quot;Squire&quot;, you really have to wonder how King Arthur ever made it to the throne, much less held onto it, without the faithful service of this plucky squire.  <br />This is an odd vision of Camelot, at  times majestic, at times rolling in mud and blood.  Arthur himself gets  angry, gets scared, runs, fights pointlessly, and generally gets out of  control.  Luckily, as I said above, Christopher is there to bail him out.   And, with no background to reccomend him, Arthur listens to him  immediately.<br />This is one of those strange books like &quot;The  Belgeriad&quot; that is not quite sure if it wants to be a &quot;Boy's Own  Adventure Tales&quot; book or the latest R-rated slasher flick.  Instead of  choosing, it willingly partakes of both in an unsatisfying mixture that  will appeal to boys/men in mid-teens through mid-20s (or whenever they  discover Mac Bolan novels...).  It is far from the worst book ever written  -- certainly the author can construct a sentence, and sometimes quite  elegantly, and yet it is an extremely disatisfying novel.  <br />I found the  vision of King Arthur to be particularly appaling, as he is viewed as a  great noble and brilliant strategist by most everyone in the book, yet his  actions immediately put the lie to this.  I have read books with  Arthur-as-villain, some of which have been quite good; this book is not  really attempting to make Arthur evil.  Instead, in trying to make the  character of Squire Christopher more important, it somehow emasculates  Arthur and relagates him to the position of &quot;bumbling buddy with too  big of a sword&quot;.  <br />Read it once.  That's about all it is good for.	2000-07-21

I have always found this to be an underappreciated chapter in the Sandman series.  I don't think people realize what Gaiman has pulled off here.  Besides coming up with a fascinating adventure story and a dizzying  sideline into how we categorize ourselves (profession, gender, dreams,  affinities, relations), he has done something few men have ever done --  written intelligently about what it is like to be a woman and a little  girl.<br />At first this may not seem like much, but the whole tale of  Barbie's quest is inherently feminine.  The dream world she inhabits is not  a boys world.  The questors are female (well, most of them and the last one  is trying hard), and the ending turns around the whole notion of being a  girl (even more than merely a child) that one of my female friends was  convinced that someone TOLD Gaiman what to write!<br />This is also a tale of  loyalty.  When it all comes down, each of the characters has to make a  decision based one what has happened, a decision that could ultimately  change each of their lives.  Surprising decisions are made, but they are  understandable if you stop and think about them.<br />I love this volume, as I  love the Sandman series in general.  I only wish (as many did) that Gaiman  had written some more.  Like any good story, we hate to see it come to an  end.	2000-07-14

While I have enjoyed RPGs in general over the years, I have never really felt fulfilled by them.  Ars Magica changed that.<br />This is a grand game, not  only in terms of system, but also in scope.  You are not slogging around  odd underground defense installations finding monsters sitting in room with  a king's ransom in gems; instead, you are part of a community and your  interests are first in foremost in the esoteric study of arcane lore and  magic.  Assuming you are a mage.  The Companion and Custos (Grogs) have a  slightly different take on life, but they are lower down the Great Chain of  Being.<br />This game assumes that in the Middle Ages the world was what  people believed it was.  Demons are real.  God is above all else.  Faeries  are around every corner.  Within this context, you, the player, are an  anomaly -- a mage with great power, socially shunned (at best), but in the  end subject to the world around you and the constraints placed on your  magic.<br />The system is elegant, requiring only 10-sided dice.  The magic  system is magesterial -- huge, flexible, yet limiting the lesser magi until  they have a chance to learn.  Most of all, the game puts you within a real  world and makes you feel enmeshed in it.  <br />If you are looking for a truly  fine RPG, this is it, hands down.	2000-06-28

I have also been fascinated with vikings for quite some time.  This supplement tries to bridge the knowledge gap concerning Scanadanavia and the Order of Odin for Ars Magica, but as is common with so  many games along this line, the vikings seemd to last for hundreds of years  after their prime.<br />Ars Magica is nominally set to begin in 1220 AD.  By  common scholarly acceptance, the last gasp of the viking era was the Battle  of Stamford Bridge, 1066 AD (about 2 weeks before the Battle of Hastings).   Most of the information given in this book would be more appropriate to the  9th or 10th centuries, rather than the 13th.  With this proviso, let me say  the information is wonderful.<br />The background information on Scandanavian  culture is, as common with Ars Magica supplements, superlative.  Social  strata, mores, pasttimes, cratfs, and the Old Beliefs are handled in an  intelligent and engaging manner.  This is by far the best system I have  ever seen for handling runic magic; while it may not be accurate (how do  you judge such things in a game?), it gives a real viking FEEL to the  power.  In addition there is a fascinating section on Finnish Wind Wizards  which, while brief, is intriguing and quite useful.<br />Overall this is a  fine book, with the one caveat of being somewhat misplaced in time.   Barring that, however, it is a wonderful addition to any Ars Magica  library, especially if you favour early campaigns.	2000-06-28

It is inherently set in Western Europe around 1220 AD.  But what of Eastern Europe?  There were people there as well, obviously, and your character migth wish to travel there.   Pity the poor storyguide who had to run to the books trying to understand  Kievan Russia.  That is until now.<br />This book, like Lion of the North,  dispells many myths concerning the Kievan states at this time.  This is not  a unified land.  It has been converted, yes, but in many ways  superficially.  Peoples attitudes are, well, different.  This book gives  you background on social structures, civic organization, politics, the Old  Ways, faeries, and even arms &amp; armour.  On top of this, for better or  for worse, it lets you glimpse the coming of the Golden Horde, as the  mongols will soon overrun this territory (wisely the game suggests setting  your time-period rather earlier than the usual 1220 AD, for otherwise you  would have a short campaign).<br />The Order of Hermes is a stranger in this  place, thus making it easier for players to plead blessed ignorance.  The  locals understand this and will pity you for your ignorance.  They will  send you to the local druzhina for assitance, to a volkhv if you seem wise,  or call down the boyars if you get out of line.<br />At least the storyguide  will know what all this means now.<br />If you want an interesting campaign  using Ars Magica, buy this book and perpare for a world of wonder.

Of the three, I recommend Fabulous Feast above all.   <br />Pleyn Delit is a decent cookbook, but several of the recipes are poorly  written and must be read three or four times before you get an inkling of  what order you must do things in.  Some of my friends have become amused  with time as each of us created one or another dish independently from each  other to wildly varying results.  <br />The support material is decent, but  not as extensive as Fabulous Feasts.  The recipes are numerous enough and  some are quite tasty; sometimes even &quot;period&quot; versions appear for  you to compare to the modernized recipe.  This book was written first by  historians, secondly by cooks.  That being said, you can have a lot of fun  with this book, just be very, VERY careful when ready the recipes or you  may well end up with soup instead of pie filling.	2000-06-01

Now that is not necessarily a bad thing in my view; far too many history books (&amp; this comes from a History Major) are written by and for hyper-specialists.  This book, however, hands  you a lot of information quickly and in a relatively painless manner about  the Royal Navy at the time of the Napoleonic Wars.<br />The book is divided  more or less into topics, although some material &quot;sloshes&quot; over  from chapter to chapter.  The style is neither drily academic nor chatty --  it is not an ABC book, however, with definitions of every term.  O'Brien  assumes that you already know a little something about nautical terms and  the warfare of the era.  <br />If you are a historian, this is not such a good  book -- you will not find enough footnotes or bibliographical material to  follow through for further research.  If you are merely into battles, again  this book will be a disappointment; much like the Aubrey-Maturin books,  this work is as much concerned (if not moreso) with minor details of daily  life and the ins and outs of naval bureaucracy as it is about battle.<br />If  you want to know something about the topic, this is a decent introduction.	2000-06-01

I love cooking.  I love history.  I love the Aubrey-Maturin novels.  Hmm.  Maybe that explians why I like this book.<br />One of the great things about O'Brian's books is that there is not only battle, but details of day to day  life, including music, clothing, and games.  Above all, however, there is  FOOD.  This book fills in the gap for the would-be Killick to set the table  for the captain.  Be forewarned -- this is not The Joy of Cooking.  This is  a cook book for people who already know how to do more than heat-n-eat.   <br />Much like Cosman's Fabulous Feasts, this book gives you something on  table manners, habits of cooking, lore of food, and, of course, the recipes  (or at least as close as we can guess to them).  The recipes are neatly  divided into sections, as with most such books, and care is given to  preparing authentic food.  Some of the ingedients are obscure and some of  the tastes will be ... acquired.  Personally, I was fascinated that there  was even a recipe for ships biscuits (and a few less savoury items) right  along side the haute cuisine of the day.<br />If you would really like to know  the flavours behind Jack's 20 stone, read this book; better yet COOK from  this book.	2000-06-01

I have always been fascinated with flavours and sounds in addition to kings and social movements.  This, of course, led to the discovery of Fabulous Feasts.<br />Now as to the 100%  accuracy of the recipes, I am unable to vouch.  I can say, however, that  they are all clearly discribed and easy to follow.  I have a particular  fondness for the arbolyetts and the parsley bread.  I have cooked, at one  time or another over the past 15 years, about 2/3 of the recipes -- some  are definitely acquired tastes and some are pure show-stoppers.<br />Cosman  also does a marvelous job of giving you food lore and manners of the latter  half of the Middle Ages.  From the salacious to the practical, all sorts of  information is here.  Her bibliography is helpful for those who want to  follow further in her footsteps and her list of where to get the  ingredients is good, but a bit dated.  WARNING:  at least one of the spice  stores listed has shut since this book was first released.<br />This is a book  for cooks and amateur historians.  It is not a HISTORY book, but rather a  cookbook that gets into a bit of history and allows you to sample the  tastes of another time and place.	2000-06-01

First notice:  do NOT read an abridged version of the tales.  You will lose too much.<br />Second notice:  do NOT be fooled into beleiving this is a history book.  This is a work of fiction, and a magnificent one.<br />So, with  that in mind, what can one say about The Three Musketeers?  Athos, Porthos,  Aramis, D'Artangnan, the great friends, the great heros, the part-time  cads, the drinkers, womanizers, war heros, saviours of the Queen's honour,  foils to M. le Cardinal -- these are the ultimate Larger Than Life  characters.  They foil dastardly plots, they involve themselves in high  politics and affairs of state, the duel constantly, and still find time to  learn lessons of friendship, honour, and betrayal.<br />This is not a  children's book, no more than 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea is a children's  book.  It was written for adults and there are many scenes children will  not understand and will become bored with.  Do not let that stop YOU from  reading it.  Teach you children parts of the tale and then work them  towards it.  Do yourself a favour and find out just how rich and complex  this tale is.  You will enjoy it.	2000-05-11

Conversely, tales of the Norse gods have been curtailed into (usually) simple retellings of the  Elder and Prose Edda.  In this book, the tales of Camelot, of the Norse, of  the Celts, of history, mythology, cosmology and haigiography coexist and  push each other around, each trying to achieve dominance.<br />This is not an  easy book to read.  I don't mean &quot;Finnegan's Wake&quot; level of  difficulty, but rather there is a lot of presumed knowledge -- you know  many tales of Uther, Ygraine, Odin, Niggdur, and at least a passing  acquaintance with figures of Irish/Celtic folklore.  In addition, you are  presumed to be literate and that you enjoy obscure words.  If you can get  past these hurdles, however, you will find an enjoyable and enriching  tale.<br />This is not a simple retelling of old tales.  The tales are woven  together, often clashing, sometimes melding.  A few of the characters are  what you would expect, but many of them have altered, strongly or subtley  -- Merlin is, indeed, half-demon, born of a virgin, but the tale is not as  simple as that; Furor is Odin, but with a different take on the invasion of  Britain by the Anglo-Saxons.  The Romans, Christians, and other historical  groups and personalities have their roles, but it is often difficult to  distinguish the history from the mythology.  This is something I enjoy, but  may bother others.<br />I believe that a challanging read is a good thing.  To  merely find what you expect in a book can be tedious.  Often this works  pushes you to the limits, but keep a dictionary nearby and several books of  basic mythology -- with these tools you will not become lost.	2000-05-11
US	51864502	RH0WTNV7LSGXD	0312890001	534545162	Wraeththu	Books	5	77	86	N	N	What speculative fiction can truly be	Years ago I read &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; by Ursula LeGuin, one of the finest authors in the English language.  I enjoyed the book very much, but the hemaphroditic race always struck me as so utterly masculine as to be unbelievable.  Storm Constantine takes this theme (amongst others)  and blows it sky-high delivering a tale of magic, power, Utopian and  Dystopian visions of the future, and the fate of humankind.<br />This is a  tale about a reality that has not happened yet.  Humans and Wraeththu both  react to a new world, sometimes well, sometimes poorly, sometimes with  poetic vision, often from a position of self-interest.  Cal, Pel, Cobweb,  all the others are real, though eerie; they are utterly compelling,  attractive to male and female alike.  The sexual aspects of the book  sometimes threaten to break loose wildly, only to be brought back under  check as Storm shows there is more to life other than sex, even when one is  defined by one's gender or sexual preferences.<br />The world has changed.   Individuals attempt to adapt to this world, but many bring their troubles,  pettiness, and fear along with them.  The paradigm is gone; long live the  new paradigm!  But what will this be?  <br />Above all, this is a work of  linguistic beauty.  Unlike so many authors, Storm Constantine really CAN  write her way out of a paper bag.  She has a way with words that may only  be compared to the Romantics of the early 19th century and the Magical  Realists of the 20th.  Her words are evocative and resonate beyond their  simple meanings.  Sentences have texture, aroma, and age to them; these are  words that move beyond dictionaries.  To read her works is a delight, a  voluptuous wrapping of cadence and suggestion.  If you have no other reason  why you would read this book, read it to learn how language may be crafted.	2000-05-10

The Wreaththu books, the Grigori books are marvels -- they take speculative fiction into entirely new directions with daring, vision, and (most importantly to me) a wonderous writing style that few have matched.  She is a Romantic writer of  the old definition and this book shows it best -- the beauty, the horror,  the claustrophobia, the decadance.  I must admit, however, that I am glad  to hear this is the beginning of a trilogy because there is not only no  sense of closure to this book, but indeed it ends with a gaping  wound.<br />This is not to say the book is bad, far from it.  Not only are the  characters intriguing, but the setting is marvelous and, once again, Storm  Constantine takes on a task that few would dare in such settings -- she  squarely hits Neo-Paganism at its roots (or lack thereof).  The worship of  the sea serpents is central to the whole book and makes the most  fascinating study as you see it first from one angle, then from another,  but rarely whole on or at once.<br />At times, however, as with the ending,  the writing breaks down.  You get interested in a character only to have  the character's role end; you become fascinated with a line of story only  to have the scene shift to several years later.  Later, however, the  threads are picked up again, but from a different perspective.<br />That is an  important aspect of the book -- nothing is lost forever, no matter how much  the characters would prefer that to be true.  These are real people and all  are fleshed out, warts and all.  There is no single character to love or to  hate; instead each of them is so complex that you wonder what is  &quot;true&quot; about them.  You are left to make up your own mind about  them.  Indeed, much like people in real life, the more you know about them,  the more complicated they become and the less you understand what at first  appeared to be their motivations.  The characters decieve each other, but  they also decieve themselves and, in so doing, cause a world of hurt to  those around them.<br />This is not an easy book, but it is a very worthwhile  book.  I look forward to the next volume with relish!	2000-05-10

Over the years with RPGs in general, there has been a trend to put out extra supplements strictly for handling the sea.  Biremes and Triremes was one of the first; this is one of the latest.  Every time one of these books  comes out, it is filled with interesting information, but there tend to be  many extra rules that most storyguides would be wise to ignore.  In Ars  Magica, money is of secondary (at best!) importance; this book, as it deals  with merchants and ship construction, tends to emphsize money.  That is a  count against it.  There are extra ways to organize long-term expeditions  by sea.  This gets very complicated.  That is a second count against it.   Conversely, there is some very interesting material on the types of vessels  used during the Middle Ages and some fun bits of nautical lore.  If you  intend to spend a LOT of time in your campaign on the waves, pick up this  book.  If you do not, don't bother.  It is amusing, but not the most useful  of supplements.	2000-03-01

Ars Magica has been a marvelous game over  the years for dispelling myths about the Middle Ages (although adding a few  more...); Lion of the North is a fine example of deep background on a land  that makes sense, is highly playable, and is reasonably accurate.  Whether  you want an overview of Scottish history, some knowledge on gruagach, or  just want to liven your campaign up a bit, this supplement is worth your  viewing.  This is the first post-White Wolf product and it shows -- you  will not find any vampires creeping around the corners here, nor the  stupidity of the Realm of Reason.  You will find out a bit more about clan  structure, the influence of the vikings, Anglo-Saxons, and Scotii on the  region, and why being the King of Scotland is not necessarily the easiest  job in the world.

The book is handled with great knowledge, grave respect, and an intensity of scholarship that one rarely sees in gaming.  I handed it to a  non-gaming friend who is a Torah scholar and he was impressed; he quibbled  with certain points, but overall he saw this as a book that helped clear up  many basic misconceptions of Judaism, especially as practiced during the  Middle Ages.<br />Kabbalah will give you background on the Jewish communities  of the Middle Ages, their beliefs, their mores, and their habits.  It will  give you insight into humour, worship, mysticism, and attempting to survive  as a marginalized yet recognized people.  Unlike the poor pastische earlier  supplements have given to the Perfecti, this supplement gives a very  accurate presentation of Jewish life (and how it varies in different parts  of Europe).  <br />Pick this book up and learn.  Shalom.	2000-03-01

On the one hand, there is the Medieval Paradigm -- &quot;we will present the Middle Ages the way people of the time saw their own world.&quot;  On the  other hand, the game is plagued with post-Reformation, 20th century, urban,  and sometimes even Politically Correct viewpoints -- the Church is  inherently evil and a form of mind control, heretics are misunderstood Free  Speech advocates, etc.  <br />This book goes a long way towards trying to make  the Church (or at least the &quot;good members&quot; of it) seem a bit more  palatable to the gaming world, which I must praise.  The presentations on  angels, on sainthood, and even on the tempers of the Divine aura are quite  intriguing.  There is still a strong effort to make the Albegensians into  12th century hippies, though, which is find ridiculous; the Albegensians  were at least as self-righteous as the Christian authorities of the era and  as strongly determined that &quot;there is my way or damnation, no middle  ground.&quot;<br />While this is a very well written supplement, few people  will want to slog through it, which is sad.  It is filled with deep  background on the nature of Heaven and the Church.  It helps correct some  of the anti-Church views of earlier supplements.  Still, many people will  find it &quot;preachy&quot;.  Hey, storyguides!  If you are to accept a  Middle Ages as people at the time accepted it, one where demons and devils  DO exist, then Christianity must exist to balance the Forces of Evil out.   This would mean that the Church is not evil, even though some particular  members of it might be.  <br />Just remember -- the Mongols are coming, backed  by dragons...  They must be the Legions of Hell...<br />(this was the popular  view at the time)	2000-03-01

The past is a foreign country and Little is one of the great guides into it.  With a fine sense of style and a deep scholarship, he brings together  various strands of the Middle Ages which seem to be at odds -- the scope of  the Church in what had been envisioned as a purely rural society, the rise  of towns, and the new problem of a profit economy.  Little explains the  rise of the friars, specifically the Franciscans and Dominicans, as an  attempt on the part of the Church to aid and better understand the rising  urban landscape.  The very notions of the moral underpinnings of lending  and borrowing are examined (&quot;How may one sell time, all of which  belongs to God?&quot;) as well as the problem of individual poverty and  collective wealth, something often debated within the body of the Church  itself.  This book will be an eye-opener to all those wishing to understand  the place of towns in Medieval society, the place of the friars (as opposed  to monks), the origins and rationale behind indulgences, and the general  problem of money in what had been a gift-giving society.  One of the best  history books of the 20th century!	1999-10-24

In the early  Middle Ages (prior to the 12th century), most matters were handled on the  basis of a public promise -- shake hands in front of people, place your  hands on a relic, etc.  In the 12th century there is a massive shift away  from this towards getting things down in writing.  Where before ideas had  been &quot;from the beginning of time&quot; (i.e. as far back as anyone  could remember, at best a couple of generations), now there was the rise of  tangible recordings of events, which might also lead to tangible forgeries.   Still the concept of taking a man at his word did not die away altogether  or quickly.  <br />This book does a fine job of describing the shifting notion  of what is proof and what counts legally in society.  There are points  where the reader will need background, such as some basic notions of the  feudal system (a notion which itself has come under attack as inaccurate of  late), but overall it is quite a readable text	1999-10-24

Instead this is as close as Moorcock comes  to writing Historical fiction, which he does to mixed effect.  It is not  until the third section that we find Moorcock consciously tying the series  into his Eternal Champion run.<br />Moorcock is a passable, but far from  stellar, writer.  His Elric series has some intriguing ideas, but he wastes  a lot of space on pointless battles.  This book has fewer battles, but  still you feel as if there is a lot of empty space to it.  While it is  definitely a cut above most fantasy, it is far from Tolkein, Kay, LeGuin or  any of the other talents of the genre.  Hidden within this volume are many  fascinating nuggets, but it still feels like a roleplaying game written  down with a bit of filler.	1999-10-24

There are few true villains in this book, just as there are  few in the world; equally finding a true hero is difficult.  Instead each  person tries to do well at times, tries to protect themselves and those  they love at others.  Some are short-sighted.

Thank goodness this series finally seems to be running out of steam.  Bernard Cornwell did more in one book (and he has three in his Arthurian  series) than Whyte has done with his entire series.  The characters  continue to be caricatures, the plots wooden, pretentious, and impossibly  convoluted, and the history ... isn't.  I will admit that 5th century  Britain is not one of the most documented eras in all of history, but there  is more information than many authors give credit for; Whyte, taking a  seperate tack, has decided that history is wrong and it will be a lot  better if he simply rewrites it so that it turns out correctly, more or  less as a modern Libertarian fantasay.  How can the characters actually  believe what they are themselves saying?  Does this community so based on  personal freedoms actually need a king?  Does anything make sense in this  book?<br />Mary Stewart did a fine job in her Merlin books of creating a  believable extrapolation of a &quot;historical&quot; background to the  Arthurian legends.  Bernard Cornwall has also done brilliantly.  Whyte,  however, falls into much the same category as David Drake -- all that  matters is lots of bloody, testosterone-pumping action and hack philosophy.  <br />I am appalled by this series.	1999-10-23

It covers aspects of the legends themselves in differing countries  and in different eras.  It covers art work.  It covers music.  It covers  particular characters.  It covers theories relating to the backgrounds to  the legends, both historical and folklorical.  The entries are readable,  clear, and give lots of information so that you can follow up on any given  topic.  I cannot praise this book enough!  Every library should have a copy  (including many personal libraries...).	1999-10-19

It wants to be a tale of love.  It tries so hard to be all of these in about 250pp that it becomes very little.  There are certain  colourful scenes, some bits of expressive prose, but the world of Riverside  and the Hills is flat and rather dull.  There are over a dozen potentially  major characters; none of them is well-fleshed.  One of the major  characters is even excised without doing anything of import in the book at  all.  Our swordsman and his lover are both incredibly flat -- I can see no  reason why they love each other beside the fact the authors needs that for  the story to continue.  The plot is contrived; the finale anticlimactic and  almost throwaway.  I enjoy a good fantasy tale, a good faery tale, a good  bit of historical romance.  I even like a good little pulp novel.  In  striving to be literate, this work falls away from its solidly pulp roots  and so serves neither end of the spectrum.  Ms. Kushner has a decent style,  but in the end she puts this ability to no discernible end.	1999-09-04

She knows the politics of the Highland border country, no mean feat in and of itself, and she knows how socks are darned.  She knows what the people read, how  they dress, what they dance to, and just how porous society can be.  The  problem is that unless you are an Elizabethan era wit (sorry -- this is  still during the reign of Edward...), you will not catch all the allusions,  not understand the quotations in 16th C Italian, Spanish, French, and  Latin, understand who several of the people she is referring to are, and a  whole mess of other problems.  Francis Crawford is a fascinating character,  although he is rather James Bond-ian -- he can do everything better than  everyone else and never break a sweat while he is doing it.  Do not expect  an easy read.  This book is unforgiving of ignorance, especially ignorance  of a period about 400 years out of date to most of us.  There are  marvelous, incredible scenes, there are dynamic characters, and there is a  helluvalot you will NEVER understand.<br />Patrick O'Brian is more my cup of  tea -- and with him you can get a book to decipher the verbage!	1999-08-15

The themes are timeless, the characters ever-mutating, and the styles used in presenting the tales tell us more of the writer's time than  of Arthur's, assuming he even existed.  This was a book I had heard of for  many year, but had never been able to read.  I would suggest that anyone  reading this book already be familiar with the outlines of the Quest for  the Holy Grail at a minimum; better yet, know your Chretien de Troyes very  well and have a good grounding in the Arthur-as-Welsh-Celt school of  writing.  Aside from that, this is a very sparse book, not as in there is  nothing to it, but the style and action is kept minimal.  It ends more or  less where Chretien ended his tales -- almost midsentence.<br />The tone is  devastating.  There seems little hope in Percival's world.  There had been  hope recently -- the evidence is all around, but it has passed.  This is a  tale of a quest incomplete, of a searcher thwarted.  It is a sad tale, sad  to the core, as blasted as the Wastelands.<br />Read it if you have a love for  these tales, but keep a happier book nearby for afters...	1999-08-15

Powers ranks for me with Robert Heinlein and Piers Anthony -- wildly popular authors who are hopeless writers.  I tried to like this book.  I REALLY tried.  In the end, the whole thing is a mess, beginning to end.  I  have read many books with non-linear plots; Powers can't handle this.  I  have read books with outlandish characters; Powers can't pull through.  I  have read historical fiction/fantasy; Powers does not know from whence he  speaks.  I have read works of occult fiction; Powers knows nothing.  I went  into this book never having read any of his works and having it praised to  the skies by no less than four of my friends -- I now wonder at their  tastes.  The characters are flat beyond compare, the plot is in its best  points contrived, in its worst points hopeless, and even the use of  &quot;thieve's cant&quot; is wrong, wrong, wrong.  My god, it is easy to  pick up Dickens and get more of theive's cant than Powers has!  This book  is revered and I know I will shift few opinions, but I must give this a  poor review.  Don't read it.  It is not worth the effort.	1999-08-07

When I heard there was a sequel to Ender's Game, I shuddered.  That book had affected me so deeply, I could not imagine a sequel to it.<br />This book is in all ways, barring one,  superior.<br />This book reminds me of Ursula LeGuin at her best, and I do not  invoke her name lightly.  She is one of the few sci-fi authors who  understands something of anthropology and, more importantly, the human  condition.  Card in this one books has levelled with her.  <br />Ender is a  far richer and deeper character in this book than he was in Ender's Game.   Here he is having to live with his own guilt and the positive and negative  aspects of his own legend.  He has inspired a cult of sorts, the Speakers  of the Dead, people who speak not well of the dead, but realistically.  How  does one live with such a legacy?<br />The Piggies are intrinsicly  fascinating.  They are not small humans.  They are not just randomly acting  individuals.  They act in a consistent, rational manner -- once you know  all the peices of the puzzle.  Most of these peices are not revealed except  with time.  Jane is also fascinating.  &quot;She&quot; acts in a logical  manner as well, but again it is not a HUMAN manner.  The Hive Queen is very  real and, again, not human.  There is a delicate balance inherent in this  book.<br />This book is far superior to Ender's Game, a book which is one of  those rare sci-fi novels that I have read twice.  It speaks to the core of  humanity within us all, it speaks to our fears, our dreams, our hatreds,  our prejudices, our nobility, our failings, and our longings.  It is not a  shoot-em-up.  This book is literature, not science fiction.  It may be read  again with profit.  It is not a book about plot and action (thank all the  powers!).  It is a book about being humnan.<br />I put a reservation in here,  one way in which the book does NOT match Ender's Game.  The ending of this  book is abrupt and calls out for a sequel.  This is quite sad.  Ender's  Game stands on its own; Speaker for the Dead calls out for a conclusion.   Aside from that, this is a superlative book.  No, not for everyone; name me  a book that is for everyone.  But in the end, an intelligent reader will  gain much from reading Speaker for the Dead.	1999-08-07

Even before the game actually arrived, I knew that I would set a campaign in the Haight district of San Francisco, and so did White Wolf.  From there, however, we  diverged completely...<br />As is common, the system is bland.  Not bad, just  bland.  I have little use for faeries with uzis -- if one thing is just  BRIMMING with Banality, it is guns.  Followed swiftly by computers,  automobiles, cd-players, etc.<br />The new version of the Seelie and Unseelie  courts is unforgiveable.  Hundreds of years of tradiation are, as is common  with White Wolf, thrown out in favour of an odd combination of political  correctness and ultra-teen-angst.  Trolls as good guys?  And just where did  they come up with this interpretation of the sluagh?  As a student of  faery, I am offended -- read your Nancy Arrowroot and Katherine Briggs,  guys!<br />The idea of the cantrips is amusing and quite workable; the notion  of Banality versus Madness takes more work.  Given the image of mundane  reality presented in these books, I wonder if humans aren't just some  version of the concept of Maya -- the illusion of the world.  Are humans  who are taken to Arcadia (a concept mentioned in the books) able to slowly  understand their human side and able to ignore magic and Glamour?  Or are  humans just innately UNreal?  <br />The biggest problem with this whole series  of games is that they want to be taken seriously on a philosophical level,  but their views are so inconsistent and contradictory that I just have to  scream out loud.<br />My suggestion?  Have your players choose one Court --  Seelie or Unseelie.  Divide the kith appropriately, adding more kith if  necessary for player choices.  Bring back the balance/war between the  Courts.  Then try to run the game in the modern world.  For my players  (some of whom had played in &quot;straight&quot; versions of Changeling  prior to my campaign) this created a much more satisfactoryvision of the  world.	1999-08-07

Oh, White Wolf has brought another helping of teenage angst into the world.  Mage is the second most intriguing concept they have come up with (Changeling is the best), but it falls apart is so many ways that it is  hard to tell where to begin.  I guess the magic is the best place as it is  so central.  <br />Everything in Mage is about personal and collective  perceptions.  Good start.  Magic doesn't usually work because most people  do not believe that it can work.  Again, good.  Therefore when a magus  attempts a spell around nonbelievers there is a high chance of failure  unless the spell is incredibly subtle.  Wonderful!  <br />And when a magus  attmepts a spell with no nonbelievers around, there is a high chance of  failure...<br />Why?  If the use of magic or science is based on personal  beliefs and biases, then a magus in the presence strictly of other magi or  off by himself should be able to go to town; this would fit with the  underlying philosophy.  Not so!  The world itself, which appears to be the  ultimate Tabla Rasa in so many instances, reacts negatively to the  magic.<br />I am tired of the Doomed Gothic-Punk world of White Wolf.  Most of  the ideas are retreads of my high school days (I graduated in 1977...).   Magi with guns just seems silly.  Magi with computers is interesting, but  seems to work at cross purposes to the underlying premise of the game --  belief systems.<br />Nice for some ideas; poor if you actually follow the  philosophy out to its logical conclusion.  <br />The gaming system itself is  nothing to write home about, either.  Not really bad, but not really good.   It just sits there.<br />Most of the 15-25 crowd will adore this game.  I'll  stick to Ars Magica	1999-08-07

'Appy Dan Pew alone is worth the price of  admission on his ship Le Grenouille Frenetique (The Frantic Frog).  There  are duels, fair maidens (of many types), every version of pirate  imaginable, and musicians diving for Korngold music.  If you enjoy a good  pirate yarn and want a good laugh, I can think of no better book.  Yes,  there is a short-coming here and there (the end is more of a second-rate  fade out than an actual conclusion), but this is less important than the  parts that are SO right.

Townsend's style is joyous and rarely hits a sour note;  young Master Mole and The Love Of His Life Pandora are marvelous; the  Familia Mole (extended and temporary) are insane in a normal kind of way.

This book takes on an amazing task:  How did King Arthur fight his many battles and win?

Where is the Budayeen?  That's not important (although from references it seems to be  near Egypt); what is important is the characters.  The people, from Audran  to Papa to Half-Hajj all fit in this world.  You know what they look like,  feel like, smell like, and if ever they act out of character you know  something is wrong.  This is a world of shadows and sand, one where there  is trickery and deceit around every corner.  The mullahs call you to prayer  and people wire their brains to alter their personalities.  Life is cheap,  sex is cheaper, and everyone has to look out for himself.  There is nothing  heavy-handed in the way Effinger puts this together.  He is stylish without  being self-conscious.  You will be drawn in and only want to read more  about this world he has created.  This is a fantastic book.	1999-03-08

There are some passages in this book that will  make you laugh out loud; there are others that will make you wonder just  where they meant the book to go.

His work is not majestic like Malory, but much  easier to read and follow, especailly for a neophyte.  Children love it, as  do adults; this book gives the basic nobility of the tales, giving a good  clue as to why they've been so popular for so long.  Green also includes  several tales of Sir Gawain, so he is not the near-felon he seems in  several late medieval texts.  The books is charming, moving, sad, happy,  and everything else you could wish from Camelot.  If you haven't read of  Arthur before, begin here; if you want to remember why you loved these  tales to begin with, read Green.  He provides more than you would ever  expect.	1999-02-23

There are scenes in this book which are incredibly vivid and stand out in your memory (whether you like it or not). Many people will tell you about the homoerotic undertone in this book; the  only reason they might count as &quot;undertones&quot; is because people  are pretty blind unless there is a direct, lurid sex scene.  We are dealing  with one of the worst-matched couples of all time. Lestat is one of the  most fascinating anti-heroes I have read about in a long time.  Louis,  conversely, is a whiner.  Hey, catch a clue, Lou!  If you don't want to be  a vampire anymore, just leave off the sunblock on the beach!  Stop  agonizing and get over it!  Of course, as we see in this book, it is a lot  more difficult than that.  It's next to impossible to kill a vampire.  Just  ask Lestat.  For imagery I give this book good marks; for Lestat, also  good; for Louis, nothing.  For plot, well...  I guess there was one...	1999-01-16

I'm fascinated with fantasy writing because so little of it is good.  Tolkein, of course, and Urusla LeGuin, but beyond that the field falls to hacks ranging from pleasant to truly awful.  Eddings is somewhere in the  middle between these last two extremes.  All of his characters seem to come  from old-school children's books (The Noble Thief, the Valiant Warrior, the  Uppity Princess) and they fulfill their roles as well as they can, but  there is little to develop.  The overarching plot of this series is nothing  to write home about.  The biggest confusion I have is just who he is aiming  these books towards.  Linguistically and stylistically they are aimed at  about a 6th grade reading level, yet he also introduces some heavily  suggestive (no real nudity, mind you) scenes as well, along with a few bits  of truly graphic violence.  My guess it is aimed for adults who can't read  beyond a junior high school level.  Not a bad book, but certainly not worth  remembering.	1999-01-16

Startide Rising is far, far different.  The concept of  Uplift itself, which is inherent in all of Brin's books, is worthy of  several dissertations in literature, philosophy, and xenobiology (when that  field ever develops...).  The story is taut and keeps you guessing; the  characters are real, even when they are utterly alien (and I must say here  that Brin develops the most alien-aliens I have ever read about).  I read  the Foundation trilogy and dismissed it; I read 2001 and was amused for a  while.  Conversely I have read Startide Rising three times already and will  be back for a fourth read soon.  It's that good.	1999-01-16

You can tell this after reading any two of his books.  There is always a Heinlein-as-character in the novel -- he has lots of money, if handsome, built like Arnie, and always has scads  of women around him.  Boy, talk about protecting a fragile ego!  I had  heard many people talk about this book for years, particularly those of a  more hippy mindset; the amazing thing is that if you read it, Heinlein is  against almost everything his core of fans seem to have found in him.  The  book is anti-drug.  Yes, it is also anti-government, but it is certainly  nowhere near as anti-tehcnology as many have made it out to be.  The  characters, except for Our Favorite Martian, are flat and unbelievable; the  plot is ludicrous; the style is boring.  Women should be lining up in  droves to condemn this book for its rampant sexism.  Why do people love it  so?  I leave that to others to decide.  Personally, I'm heading off to read  something by someone with a real idea.	1999-01-16

She said, &quot;Oh, you like dwarves?  Well, I've got a book with a dwarf in it.&quot;  Handed this book, I became, in less than an hour, a confirmed  Robertson Davies fan.  Here is a sense of history, of art, of magic, and of  human peculiarities, lovingly portrayed.  Davies is an artist with words;  his powers of observation are impeccable; his interest in the world  unbounded.  I cannot say what the book is ABOUT, because that would detract  from it.  Suffice it to say that this is one of the finest works in the  English Language, no matter what the Modern Library list had to say.	1999-01-15

I have to wonder to myself why I even bother to continue reading this man's work (see my previous reviews of the earlier volumes).  If he wrote purely as fantasy the world would pass him off as a hack, but as a writer  of historical fiction he should be drummed out of the club.  Has the man  never read even the basics of Celtic culture?  Surely with all the hundreds  of books available on the subject he should be able to find something!  His  knowledge of the era is fascinatingly scanty and he fills it in with such  wild speculation that one is tempted to believe tha aliens are at work.   The plot, once again, happens -- there is no reason for anything to happen,  but it happens anyway.  The characters are caricatures.  The relation to  the Arthurian legends is even scantier then the relation to history.  This  man is an awful writer.  Camelot 3000 is more plausible than this tripe.	1998-11-30

Rien van Poortvliet, then popular because of his Gnomes books, had illustrated this volume of Arthurian tales.  I cannot say enough about it.  Here, stripped  down to its essentials, is the entire heart, spirit, and soul of the tales,  painfully and lovingly told.  I remember going through a period of wanting  to learn Dutch in order to read it in the original.  From Arthur's birth,  to the founding of the Round Table, to the search for the Grail, and the  final crashing days of despair, this book follows the warp and weft with an  unerring honesty and brilliance matched by few writers.  If you are looking  for a one-volume overview of the legends, look no further.  Read this!  Oh,  and the illustrations are good, too.	1998-11-30

Some complain of lack of characters and lack of plot.  &quot;Pfaw!&quot; I say to them.  This is  a book beyond such petty measurements.  This is a short book, yet it will  take you days to read it as each chapter, often no more than 2-3 pages,  some as short as 1, takes you to a different experience of the human soul.   Have you even felt constrained by your past, your relationships, your  desires?  All of this is here.  This is not a &quot;novel&quot; in the  classical sense, but rather a mode of exploration of what it means to be  human, often disappointed, occaisionally enlightened, always questioning.   This is a work of crystal, delicate, crafted, light.  Come back to it again  and again to learn!	1998-11-30

Why is everyone so excited about it?  The main character does nothing of consequence for the entire book, which is amazing considering that, as one of the sleepless beings  Kress has created, she lives without aging (?!?) for centuries.  Kress  doesn't know what she is writing about.  There is nothing plausible in her  science, her sociology, her characters, or, worst of all, her plot.  The  plotting comes from the &quot;One Damn Thing After Another&quot; school  where things happen because the author needs a plot complication (see Jack  Whyte for another example of this style).  There is nothing organic at all  about the characters, either in how they relate to each other or to the  plot occuring around them.  this is truly Shakespeare's &quot;tale told by  an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing&quot;.	1998-11-30

Ms. Kennealy combines the two poorly.  The Celts come from outer space.  they have psychic powers and faster-than-light-travel.  They fight with swords  and spears.  This probably explains why the Romans beat them...  These  tales are a wonderous amalgamation of a bit of reading of the poorer end of  Arthuriana, New Age literature, a liberal dose of odd drugs, and a sense of  light fantasy.  The characters are, at times, interesting, but for the most  part incomprehensible.  Again, this may explain why the Romans drove them  off earth...	1998-11-30

How do you talk about a man who can write like a prose Shakespeare, has knowledge of more &quot;trivia&quot; than the host of Jeopardy, and has both a sense of humour and an insight into the agony and splendour of the  human condition?  Supposedly these works are tracking down the question  &quot;Who Killed Boy Stanton?&quot;, but that is almost beside the point.   Here are mystic journeys in search of obscure saints, the comparison  between magic and miracles, the use of stones in snowballs, how to deal  with students, psychiatrists, and overbearing boors, and what its really  like to run away to the circus.  You cannot read this book once; you have  to read it multiple times, each time gaing even more than the last.  This  is brilliance itself, and yet none of these works ended up on the Top 100  Books List of the 20th Century.  &quot;Why&quot; is a matter open to  criminal investigation!	1998-11-30

Many people attempt &quot;alternate histories&quot; and yet few, aside from Turtledove and now Garfinkle, have done enough of their homework to make it plausible.  Set in an alternate world at an indeterminate time (I  suppose you could work it out if you knew the Athenian dating system  better), Greece and the Middle Kingdom have been locked in war for  generations, nay centuries -- consider this the ultimate Western Logic  versus Eastern Vision division to ever come along.  Garfinkle understands  Aristotlean physics and takes its implications to their greatest  &quot;logical&quot; extreme, such as a gun that fires a bolt capable of  halting forward motion, thus causing an airborne craft to seek its natural  place amongst the elements (metal falls to earth).  Due to friend's input,  I learn that his knowledge of Taoist physics, while slighter, is also  sound.  The flight to and through the celestial spheres is exciting, well  concieved, and plausible given the science base of the era.  Even more  important, however, is the development of the characters.  Each is fully  rounded, lovingly crafted, and a true joy to journey with.  One can only  hope that he writes more, not in the same world, but in the same vein.   This is one of the best science fiction books I have ever read!	1998-11-30

Continuing in his &quot;one crisis after another&quot; school of writing, nothing makes sense  if one sits back and thinks about it for any length of time.  The  characters are dull and monolithic; the setting forced; the events  contrived.  His obsession with sex scenes that the characters detest is  getting on my nerves.  If his characters hate these events so much, why do  they keep appearing?  There are so many points where logic would demand  that his whole colony fall apart due to internal disorder (not to mention  woefully inadequate resources and manpower) that the mind fails to  comprehend how it could possibly survive.  History and historicity are  thrown out the window; the basis of the legends is forgotten.  Whyte fails  in these books on all counts and yet, like the Mack Bolan books, will  continue to be popular with those who only want impossible adventure and  pointless escapades.  Expect to turn your mind off when you read these  books -- it will be safer for you.	1998-11-14

Sharan Newman has created a world where magic is not apologized for, where the silly as  well as the heroic happens, where the legends are allowed to BE without  adding some sort of polically correct nonsense.  This is not a historical  book, neither is it the legends as set in stone.  Instead it is a  delightful tale of a young woman of magical qualities coming of age in a  time not truly meant for her.  The tale is loving, kind, silly, harsh, and  deeply magical.  A truly enjoyable work.	1998-11-14

I rarely love them together and this man is a reason why.  He has little understanding of the legends, the era, the Saxons, the Romans, or even techniques of sword  making, no matter how much he pretends.  I find this sort of writing an  embarrasment to historical fiction -- O'Brien can do excellently, Cornwell  and Forester decently, and Whyte not at all.  His characters moan for a  Roman Republic over 400 years dead without the least understanding of its  mechanics.  In many ways this is merely a poorly written Libertarian  fantasy, a pointless anti-government tract posing as historical fiction.	1998-11-10

Whyte is back again writing his sad attempts at historical fiction without understanding history, legends, or even basic logistics.  How can The Colony hide?  There must be well over 3000 people, apparently better armed  than anyone else in the district, and yet they are so sneaky no on realizes  that they are there.  On top of this the writing comes from the &quot;one  damn thing after another school&quot;; there is no organic plot flow, but  only happenstance strung together hamfistedly, with occaisional perverse  sex scenes to spice matters up.  The man must still be writing more  because, even after two books, he has yet to introduce Arthur.  I fear the  page when the king appears...	1998-11-10

Andrej is a man of seemingly deep conscious,  although this drops when he takes to his task.  Actually, the most  intriguing character is Noycannir, a fellow student and member of the  judicial bureaucracy.  Her intense egotisitical/paranoid view of the  universe is well-delineated.  There is little discussion of the more  psychological aspects of torture, focusing on the more grusome and basic  uses of knives and whips.  Ms. Matthews also tends towards long sentences  that become unwieldy at times, to the point of distraction.  There is a  good core idea here, but not as well executed as it might be.	1998-10-28

For the longest time, fantasy books have been mere Tolkein rip-offs or poor showings, such as Mercedes Lackey's recycling of the SCA.  Guy Gavriel Kay has created a work here set in a not-quite-Italy, that is bold,  imaginative, and a pure joy to read.  The quest to restore the very name of  a nation is not only boldly innovative, but was so poingantly created in  the prologue as to touch the heart.  The most powerful statement I can make  about this book is that not only are the heroes understandable, but so are  the villains.  They are not, as in so many books, evil because they are  evil, but rather feel that they, too, are following a correct course of  action, even if their veiws are somewhat skewwed.  From beginning to end  this book is a wealth of detail, rich in a fantasy that partakes of wordly  reality.  I would also suggest reading his Lions of al-Rassan, done in an  equally splendid manner but in a not-Spain, as oppossed to not-Italy.   Kay's works are masterful in plotting, use of language, but most  importantly in an inherent sense of what it means to be a human being under  dire circumstances.  Bravo, bravo, bravissimo!	1998-10-28
