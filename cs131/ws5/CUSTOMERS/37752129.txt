Mr. Lind's book, gives a fairly decent analysis of the causes, consequences, and aftermath, of Vietnam.  However, he appears to criticize the left, more than the right, but does offer some criticism of people like General William Westmoreland (who's idea to send more troops would have been a disaster).  He points out the escalating conflict, which drew in Presidents from Eisenhower to Nixon, and the mistakes each of them made with a fairly balanced criticism.  However, he faults the anti-war left for &quot;restraining&quot; the military, and that the after effects of this are having consequences today, e.g., in the views of Bush, versus Kerry, with regard to Iraq; though the book stops before then.  He claims that the liberals would make America more isolationist and this might allow regimes, e.g., in Kosovo, to have more power.  I don't agree with all of his analysis, but he rightly points out many of the reasons why America did not &quot;win&quot; this war/conflict and why if some of the same mistakes are made, and if there is no political and military power, to balance the United States, some of the consequences that might follow in (the) future.  Overall, not bad, but sure to stir emotions; whether a &quot;fan&quot; of the military or not, liberal or conservative, pro or anti war, Democrat or Republican, interventionist or isolationist.  Worth a read, for at least one person's analysis and perspective.	2004-03-24

This is a most excellent mystery, written by one of Britain's premiere writers.  Beginning with a murder (naturally) and a missing person, Campion and his companion (with the barely pronounceable first name) Lugg, set to uncover what happened.  Some of the old &quot;English/British&quot; expressions might send one to the closest OED (Oxford English Dictionary, of course) and a line of &quot;French&quot;, literally, at the end of the last chapter might require a &quot;French&quot; dictionary (for those who, like me, did not take the language in school).  Otherwise, a fine book.  I wish they would put the video (PBS) version of this book out, as it (the title character, Campion) was well played by Peter Davison of Dr. Who fame.	2003-12-24

This abridgment of the Nelson DeMille novel, provides an interesting story of three people, the Mafia boss, the lawyer, and his wife.  Well read by the late, great, David Dukes, whose inflections and wry way of reading makes this a most interesting tale.  I'd also recommend &quot;The Charm School&quot;, &quot;By The Rivers Of Babylon&quot;, &quot;The Lion's Game&quot;, &quot;Plum Island&quot;.  [Too bad the movie of &quot;The Lion's Game&quot; isn't likely to see the light of day, in the wake of 9/11 and the current threats.]	2003-12-22

This collection of three of the best known adventures of 007, is a well read collection, but many (especially women) might find them a bit &quot;politically incorrect&quot; (i.e., for the treatment of women and so on [but hey, it was the &quot;swinging '60's&quot;, so you have to put this in context, historically speaking]).  I'm not sure if Ian Fleming wrote that famous line in Goldfinger, which is perhaps why it's omitted in this adaption, in the exchange between Bond and him, &quot;Do you expect me to talk, Goldfinger?&quot;  <BR>&quot;No Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!&quot;.  (Perhaps, I need to check the text-as I have a print equivalent to both audio sets, or another reader could verify this.)  In any case, these are some rousing adventures.  Get both volumes, and if you can find them, their print equivalents.  I look forward to listening to set two soon.	2003-11-05

This book, part series guide; part primer on forensic science, gives some of the scientific background to C.S.I.. (Crime Scene Investigation) and now, also, C.S.I. Miami, as well as other movies and shows; where science and criminology meet. Gives fairly good explanations, although some are left out, maybe because anyone who watches these shows has heard terms, for example, &quot;bindle&quot; [a piece of paper or some small envelope, used for evidence collection].  Some of the &quot;real life&quot; cases, as contrasted to some of the episodes, are pretty gruesome and not recommended for everyone. Great for fans of the shows [like me] or anyone moderately curious about how some crimes are solved.	2003-10-20

This &quot;sequel&quot; to Gaston Leroux's Phantom Of The Opera finds Erik following his lady love Christine to New York.  While not as bad as some reviewers make it out to be, it's not Leroux.  However, it's well read by the actors, including, Roger Rees as The Phantom and Arte Johnson. The others weren't bad. It would be nice to know who played some of the other characters.  The voice introducing the chapters was low, and mysterious, in keeping with the story, although, at first, I thought there was something wrong with my tape player; until I heard the other voices and knew then it was ok.  Worth a listen but Forsyth should stick more to thrillers like Day Of The Jackal, The Dogs Of War, and The Odessa File.	2003-08-12

The characters are strong, especially Jordan Glass, as she searches for her sister.  The Wheaton character is dark, chilling, and creepy, with a disturbing past.<BR>The story moves along at a fairly nice pace.  I would also recommend 24 Hours (filmed as &quot;Trapped&quot; with Charlize Theron) and the Quiet Game.  Excellent idea for a movie (better than most out there now).	2003-07-23

This book is compiled from a series of columns, written by the late columnist for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, host of &quot;St. Louis On The Air&quot;, and &quot;Mosaic&quot; on public television in St. Louis.  Mr. Freeman died on 31 December, 2002.  He was beloved by many.  His book divided into 6 sections, gives an overview of life and memories in St. Louis.  He also deals with topics such as racism, living in St. Louis, and others, with intelligence and humo[u]r, and his comments will &quot;hit home&quot;, i.e., strike a familiar chord with many St. Louisians, this one included.  I found many of the stories funny, poignant, and found myself, more often than not, saying &quot;Uh huh, right!&quot;  I could relate some of the incidents and feelings he describes, e.g., on the death of his father, to my own feelings on the death of my father.  He never complains about his various illnesses; which eventually took him away. In fact, his only complaint was about losing his hair, something many men his age, like myself, are concerned with.  All in all an excellent book, a great man, an interesting description of life, events, and thoughts about local and national issues.  A must read for all St. Louisians.  An important read for everyone else.  His genius is truly missed.  A hearty recommendation for this book.  I'd give it ten stars if I could.  God Bless Greg Freeman!	2003-07-16

This is the first story of Ridley Pearson's I've listened to [I'm referring to the abridged audiocassette version] featuring Lou Boldt.  It was not bad.  The story seems a little familiar (perhaps, because &quot;Law and Order&quot; or one of the program(me)s; perhaps, CSI, I'm not sure)had a similar story.  Anyway, the reader, Scott Rosema, kept the story &quot;tight&quot;.  The characters, the detective, the reporter, and her friend, who took a chance going &quot;undercover&quot;, are fairly strong.  I think I'd like to check into more of Mr. Pearson's work.  Recommended to me by a co-worker.  Not bad, as I said, even though familiar.	2003-07-09

This book is an above-average thriller; which almost seemed prophetic, given the SARS outbreak, and Ebola, and provides a fairly fast paced story.  Mr. Campanella does a fine job (though his &quot;British&quot; accent is a bit weak) at reading this first &quot;Covert<BR>One&quot; novel.

This adaptation of Patricia Cornwell's The Last Precinct, where one goes when justice can't be found elsewhere, wasn't too bad.<BR>Ms. Maxwell's Southern drawl fits right in with the Virginia setting.  Dr. Scarpetta, the heroine of Ms. Cornwell's novels, is in the middle of being investigated.  There's the search for a character (cutely named) &quot;the werewolf&quot;.  There's Ms. Scarpetta's devoted niece, a detective named Marino, and a host of other figures; helping to move the story along.  This book is better (at least the audio version is) than Black Notice; which I couldn't get into.  (I may try to reread it later.)  Pretty decent story.  [An aside-if you get to check out Ms. Cornwell on the ABC Primetime special with Ms. Diane Sawyer, investigating some real life homicides, check it out.]	2003-06-16

Working through five grisly cases (with sometimes graphic descriptions and photos) he does a fine job in laying out the facts, the scientific evidence, and related details.  If one is a fan of shows like CSI and CSI Miami; which I am, it gives one the real life \\"science\\" behind these programs.  Otherwise, not bad.	2003-06-10

I found that he has some valid points, regarding some of the decisions made, in foreign policy, by American Presidents and their administrations.  He does appear to be focused on the mistakes made, he says, by the Clinton administration; which, no doubt some are true and some are due to his political perspective. His comments, regarding Iraq, Iran, and others, seem to be fairly appropriate right now (especially with the current war). Like the other book of his, Diplomacy, he presents eloquent, intelligent arguments; some of which, like his criticisms of Bill Clinton, I don't happen to agree with, as I probably wouldn't with this newest right-wing diatribe, &quot;Dereliction of Duty:...&quot;; which is written by a former military man, someone who probably has an ax to grind (since Clinton never served in the armed forces). Anyway, it's overall, not bad, but I wouldn't give it five stars, for the forgoing reasons, and I would recommend reading Diplomacy, and another book, if one can find it, by former Secretary Of State, James Baker.  I am wondering why Dr. Henry Kissinger hasn't been asked on any of the news broadcasts for his opinion. He has a very unique perspective. I know many don't like him, but I respect (even when I disagree with) him.	2003-03-28

Example, do Muslim women really want to wear a burqa, or other garment: is it cultural; i.e., is it truly their choice, for modesty, or is it \\"mandated\\". Did he ask any women; without \\"minders\\", i.e., someone watching them, to monitor their answers.  Did he consult with any Muslims?  Why is a \\"belly dancer\\" not considered \\"immodest\\" in her dress; while a \\"Western\\",or other non-Muslim, woman, even if dressed, by non-Islamic standards, \\"modest\\" considered to be \\"immodest\\" (to put it politely)?  I do admire the man for trying to separate the \\"radicals\\" from \\"ordinary\\" Muslims, e.g., a Bin Laden, or the Taliban, from say, the devout, but not radical, Muslim man or woman.  I am not sure I'm thoroughly convinced that many, but not all, Muslims feel as warmly to Non-Muslims as Mr. Esposito indicates.  There are many points on which I would \\"agree to disagree\\" with him (and the faithful) but it does bring a new found respect for many of the followers of the Prophet.  I would hope that this book would answer many questions and clear up many misconceptions, on both sides, as all religions have their \\"radicals\\"; including, Christianity.  \\"God (Allah) sent the message, through many messengers. However, some of the people since, on all sides, have caused us all to be at odds with our brothers and sisters of all faiths (through misinterpretation of the divine word, in what ever form it might take, i.e., the Koran, The Torah, The Bible, or others\\".  Let all good people, of all faiths, attempt to understand, even where they disagree with one another, and to fight \\"radicals\\" within all faiths.  This book does that to some extent.

The fact that she went along with some of his perverted, sick, diseased ideas (considering if she had known his further plans, i.e., having his friend \\"sleep\\" with her, she might have sought an annulment)in some ways, does not lend sympathy to her either (only for the children).  To my mind, life terms were too good for this depraved man.  Robert Hanssen should consider himself lucky that he is an American (though an insult to his country).  Anywhere else, they'd have executed him.  The including of a couple of his web stories bears this out. This guy is seriously disturbed.  I am actually amazed this book got written.  Having said all of this, I'd recommend it as an example of an examination of a person with too high a position, going bad, and having the consequences come back to rightfully give him what he deserves.	2003-02-03

Books	4	0	0	N	N	Not bad for a romantic suspense book	The reading of In Their Footsteps (Old Secrets Die Hard), which is by Nanette Savard, not the author, unless it's a pseudonym, wasn't bad.  She handled the accents fairly well (British & French) and she kept the story moving along.  I didn't know if I'd like such an audio, but I did, and I don't know if I'd listen to or read any of Ms. Gerritsen's other books, but this one wasn't bad at all.  If you can find it (in an out-of-print site or store) check it out.  It certainly is better than most of the run of the mill romances and mysteries (think Harlequin).	2003-01-29

This wonderful, if sad, book about Morrie Schwartz is a story of two men, one young, one old, and about the lessons of life as passed from one generation to the next.  Mr. Schwartz's philosophy of life, passed on each Tuesday, to his former student, Mr. Ablom, can be a philosophy for us all.  This man, Mr. Schwartz, and his ability to deal with ALS in such a way as most of us could never imagine, is a great example of courage.  Where we might feel sorry for ourselves (which he does, but only a little) and leave it at that, Mr. Schwartz moves on, dealing with his affliction (ALS).  His views of life, love, relationships, and the things people value: love, money, sex, and so on, may seem naive to some, simplistic to many, but in the end, there is a lot of truth to what he said.<BR>I have no doubt Mr. Ablom came away from his \\"lessons\\" with his former professor a (hopefully) better person and I believe we could all come away better if we would read and adopt the late Mr. Schwartz's views.  It's a wonderful book, a bit sad, as I stated at the beginning but I'd highly recommend it to anyone who (when they feel overshadowed by life's trials and tribulations) sees how one man dealt with them.  May the late Mr. Schwartz be eternally blessed.	2002-11-19

Books	5	11	13	N	N	great book	I own the book by Mr. Stark, and I also recommend the books by Bryan Garner, including, Elements Of Legal Style.  The Stark book and the others, like the example I gave are useful for lawyers, law students, and paralegals, like myself, or anyone who writes on legal matters.	2002-10-02

He rightly warns listeners/readers of his use of the infamous &quot;N&quot; word, as it is set in the historical context of the novel.  [I am listening to the audio version and look forward to buying the print version (when it comes out in paperback in 2003)].	2002-09-19

Not unlike the NBC show &quot;The West Wing&quot;, the battles over language; the frustration over when things go wrong and  the joy at when they go right, this book by Michael Waldman sparkles with wit and humor.  It also goes a long way to explaining the tough task of working for a President like Bill Clinton.  If you're a &quot;West Wing&quot; fan, as I am, and want to get a clue into working inside the White House, read this book.	2002-08-14

The book is good, except that it could have used an index, to look up certain concepts, e.g., gun shot residue (GSR), and DNA; as well as a glossary of these terms. Perhaps, the author will consider these for a revised edition. Otherwise, helpful in understanding the \\"science\\" behind programs like \\"CSI\\" and the soon to be \\"CSI Miami\\". (That's why I didn't give it 5 stars-lack of the above-mentioned.)<BR>.. I'd still recommend the book. However, in case my later review didn't make it in Mr. Ragle's criticism of CSI, unfairly, categorizes the producers of the show, and the actors, as not following \\"true\\" scientific methods, according to him.  They may take a bit of \\"creative license\\" but the forensics are (fairly) sound.  So, that's why I lowered my rating by another star.	2002-07-03

Emailed the author to tell him it would make a great movie, if handled properly.  I also enjoy books by Jack Higgins, Nelson Demille, and David Baldacci, among others.  Check it out.  Cheers! Peace!
