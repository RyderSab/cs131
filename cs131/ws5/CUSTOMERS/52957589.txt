Paglia's Sexual Personae is a work of critical theory focusing on human sexuality. Paglia assumes the mantle of rogue apostate feminist and declares:<br /><br />1. Had the development of civilization been left to women we would still be living in swamps.<br />2. Aesthetic creation is an intrinsic function of male physiology: Men have phalluses thus they create.<br />3. Whereas female biology has a centrality rooted in the earth, male biology is psychologically peripheral and thus inevitably driven to dominate all that is female. Males are thus driven to \\"subdue the earth\\" - creating civilization.<br /><br />From this psychosexual premise, Paglia develops her central thesis: Male dominance and feminine submission are central to High Culture. Her thesis, then, clearly is informed by the stark human equations championed by de Sade and Sartre and Saint Paul. While the first half of Sexual Personae is highly entertaining, the second half of the book labors under (what appears to be) the logical inconsistency of Paglia's \\"hermaphrodite\\" concept.<br /><br />Paglia argues that up to the Renaissance, European sexual roles and sexual personae - male and female psychologies - were vibrant and well-defined. After that, there commenced a period of diffused \\"maleness\\" and \\"femaleness\\", resulting in muddled psychosexual conceptions of what had always been, in the good ol' days, clear-cut gender roles.<br /><br />In other words, Paglia's central thesis of the centrality of sex in the creation of High Culture starts unintentionally echoing Douglas Adams' hilarious quip in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy - invoking a pre-Renaissance golden age when \\"Men were REAL men, women were REAL women, and small brown furry creatures from Alpha Centauri were REAL small brown furry creatures from Alpha Centauri\\".<br /><br />Paglia's logical inconsistency lies in her having to acknowledge CG Jung's axiom that creative males inevitably develop their inner feminine, while contradictorily arguing that this sort of thing *really* is an undesirable, post-Renaissance muddling of psychosexual identity. And so it goes - page after page of Paglia reaffirming ad infinitum how the works of all post-Renaissance male artists clearly portray their vast unconscious consuming dread of the \\"vagina dentata\\" - the \\"devouring vagina\\". (No, I'm not making this up.) This dread presumably being an inevitable consequence of these artists' collective, psychological hermaphroditism.<br /><br />That said, Paglia's finale - an analysis of Emily Dickinson, whom Paglia refers to as \\"the American de Sade\\" - is one of the most thought-provoking textual analyses in this or any other work of critical theory I've encountered.<br /><br />By book's end, after all the intellectual pyrotechnics have faded, Paglia has presented a worldview similar to that of Giambattista Vico: Not only do we live in Vico's post-mythological world, we (apparently) also are occupying Paglia's World of Confused Gender Roles of masculinized women and feminized men.<br /><br />Sexual Personae is quirky, brilliant, engaging, and encyclopedic - a tour de force of erudition. Recommended to anyone interested in a highly unorthodox appraisal of sexuality in Western Art.reative males inevitably develop their inner feminine, while contradictorily arguing that this sort of thing *really* is an undesirable, post-Renaissance muddling of psychosexual identity.

This is one of the most important questions of all, because what this says is that this is really your great dream and your great ambition in life, and if you can write the answer to this question it means that you can have it. The very fact that you can think clearly about what this answer might be, and that you can write the answer down on paper, means that you are capable of accomplishing it. Nature is not capricious, and Nature does not on the one hand give us the ability to clearly visualize and write down a goal without at the same time giving us the ability to realize it. This is one of the most exciting things about the human psyche - the very fact that you can crystallize your desire means that you can achieve it. The only question is, how badly do you want it, and are you willing to pay the price to get it? Because the only limitation is in your own mind, it is not contained in physical reality.\\"<br /><br />The above is Brian Tracy's central thesis in these six motivational cassettes. The material is classic Peale and Nightingale with considerable modern psychological research added (for example, the description of Johannes Shultz's autogenic conditioning of Olympic athletes to consistently enhance their performance). Although there is a plethora of such works, Tracy is a sincere and engaging speaker, and this upbeat material is a good reminder of the things winners never forget.	2004-04-29

Sewage. And what do you have if you pour a teaspoon of sewage into a bottle of wine? Sewage. I'm unsure which this book is, but you can take your pick. Either way, you wind up with sewage.<br /><br />If this book is any barometer of Rabbi Boteach's \\"religion\\", he has none. Like David Schnarch's book [[ASIN:B00159T73Q Passionate Marriage]], this book is the perfect wedding present for couples planning to divorce within a year of tying the knot. Rabbi Boteach states: What this book is *not* is an invitation to open marriage or adultery. I would agree. It's just a strong inducement.<br /><br />\\"Adultery serves a double wrong; first, because it betrays a marriage and causes terrible pain to one's spouse; and second, because it robs a marriage of the input it needs to survive and prosper. On a more individual level, adultery erodes, if not utterly destroys, the faith and trust that one partner has in the other. Worse, it causes an almost incurable feeling of inadequacy that the partner who has been cheated on cannot shake.... What is particularly unjust about this ... is that it is the *victim* who feels responsible.<br /><br />\\"Just suppose [Boteach continues] husbands could never afford to become complacent because they were married to voracious sexual seductresses that constantly need to be re-seduced. Wives became the living embodiment of a man's sexual fantasies - a woman with an insatiable appetite who would do anything for sex. If this were to occur, would men still need to turn to manufactured porn entertainment when the real thing is in their bedrooms? Would it not lead us to be constantly attracted to our partners?\\"<br /><br />Rabbi Boteach conveys much originality in his analysis. He calls upon, as his primary source, the Decalogue, particularly the Tenth Commandment: \\"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his a**, nor any thing that is thy neighbor's.\\"<br /><br />This Commandment, Rabbi Boteach maintains, implies a husband *is* to LUST after *his own* wife. That's patently wrong - because lust is a cardinal sin, but let that pass. Next, Boteach argues sex is a most holy gift given by a Benign Creator to enlighten and elevate humanity, and he refutes the Darwinian message that men and women are mere mechanical automata - inevitably behaving like animals - rather than created in the image of God. That's much better and more on target. Next, Boteach argues that the business of being truly human is to transcend our natures: In this case, to be passionately monogamous for a lifetime. Again, so far so good, but possibly sketchy. Next, Boteach argues that fiery, passionate sexuality is the very core of every successful marriage, that just as it is not \\"compatibility\\" a spouse seeks in a wild erotic fling, so it is not \\"compatibility\\" that holds a lively and life-affirming marriage together, and thus it follows [?] that what holds a successful marriage together is wild sex in the bedroom.<br /><br />Now we start to smell the sulphur fumes coming off the book.<br /><br />If you think \\"lust\\" is what holds a marriage together, that is, if you think a cardinal sin has anything good to offer anyone, you may want to contact me to buy the Manhattan Bridge. Or buy this book. What happens when age sets in, beauty fades, disability sets in? Apparently the rabbi thinks a reasoning animal made in the image of God being ruled by his crotch is somehow biblical or common-sensical rather than farcical.<br /><br />As you gather, I differ slightly with the rabbi. Lust is no substitute for trust, I'd say. Trust requires character, which lust does not. Lust is for adolescents and men who never grew up. I am not being puritanical about this. I am being practical. If you would like to spend your married life being made to feel jealous atthe drop of a hat in unexpected moments, you will embrace the rabbi's thesis. To me, the rabbi's \\"make her jealous\\" advice sounds like something from a high school locker room. From someone as presumably intelligent as a rabbi, it sounds like \\"advice\\" straight from hell. It's stupid. And it's demonic. Clearly such \\"advice\\" [sic] will attack and erode trust between partners over time. Clearly such \\"advice\\" [sic] will undermine a marriage. Clearly such \\"advice\\" [sic] will ensure a husband and wife remain perpetual adolescents with filthy souls.<br /><br />The rabbi seems to be selling sewage spiked with wine, in other words.<br /><br />To convict the rabbi with his own words, such a sin against purity \\"betrays a marriage and causes terrible pain to one's spouse, and [it] robs a marriage of the input it needs to survive and prosper. On a more individual level [it] erodes, if not utterly destroys, the faith and trust that one partner has in the other.

Brooks explains the standard valences of NLP: The human mind links sequential \\"processing strategies\\" with specific events and specific feelings.

But you'll learn little of NLP's virtues from the morally bankrupt material on this CD, for Instant Rapport is little more than a travesty of the sixth chapter of Anthony Robbins' oustanding book [[ASIN:0684845776 Unlimited Power : The New Science Of Personal Achievement]], which book, unlike Brooks' CD, is an uplifting motivational introduction to NLP.

This book is a New Age bible for personal irresponsibility and victim blaming. Don't be surprised when Evans eventually goes public announcing this entire book to be a farcical lampoon of the dregs of self-help literature. Meantime, what's odd is some people take this book's satiric assault on reason, morality, sanity, and self-responsibility to heart:<br /><br />\\"We sense that something is wrong just under the surface. Our ship has gone off course. Our world is not as safe as and as sane as we would like. Our intention and the course we have come to expect does not hold.... Some of us become aware of it and so we make the necessary adjustments. In a sense we reset our rudder. But others, not realizing that they are off course, have compounded their error by holding firm, reaffirming their intention, only to get where they don't want to go more quickly.... No matter how firmly they've relied upon the rudder of good intentions, their good intentions are not manifested, because something else, quite unknown to them, has come into play, and because it is a deep, strong, and hidden current, it is a very compelling force\\" (page 24).<br /><br />There you have it. Evans' description of a controlling person - some strange creature (like the Loch Ness Monster) who is \\"off course\\", disconnected from self and others, and consequently trying to control you... It's a useless formless definition, but let's accept it momentarily for the sake of argument. Go put Evans' ideas into action. Point out to somebody his unconnected inner self. Describe to him his controlling behavior. Watch the response you get.<br /><br />Evans describes a Cloud Cuckoo Land where people gratefully embrace your telling them about how unconnected they are to their inner selves and where you can simply say \\"What?\\" to rid the world of all controllers. This keystone cop material is the backbone of Evan's thesis. Anyway, who really is \\"the controller\\" in any given situation? How can you tell? Evans is never too clear on this vital point. Since she's laid down no principles, but instead vague subjective druthers, as her standard, she cannot possibly be clear - on this or any point. But a thorough reading of this book indicates it is never you, the reader, who is being controlling. Instead, it's any individual saying or doing anything of which you disapprove - for any reason whatever.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Q: What is Controlling People really about then?<br />A: CP is a slick and hysterical repackaging of \\"I am rubber, you are glue\\" taken to its ultimate hilarious conclusion.<br /><br />Q: Trenchant examples in Controlling People of *couples* Evans' approach has helped?<br />A: \\"Go fish.\\"<br /><br />Q: Why?<br />A: Because Evans' approach worsens any bad situation by injecting a lethal dose of smoke and mirrors, ignoring personal responsibility.<br /><br />***<br /><br />For any who still consider Controlling People is not a spoof: Evans' anecdote of working at home on her PC when the electricity was cut off by a repairing electrician. Rather than seeing this fellow as preoccupied with repairing Evans' electrical problem, Evans declares his misstep a clear-cut attempt to \\"control\\" Patricia Evans - and she responded by telling him so straight to his face. And that is exactly what Evans describes as the \\"backward approach\\" used by all controlling people on their hapless victims - telling them what they are *really* doing. So there you have it: Patricia Evans offering her own controlling behavior as an example of her famous controlling people defense method in action. Evans: 1 ; Hapless Stranger: 0. This is the wisdom Evans barks between the covers of this arch-useless, satiric, \\"self-help\\" book.<br /><br />If you're still unconvinced Patricia Evans' \\"Controlling People\\" is a morbid spoof, compare the moral quagmire of her \\"advice\\" with the clear message of Dr Stephen Covey's [[ASIN:0743269519 The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People]], in which Covey makes clear only behavior and thinking rooted in principles - not self-interest - are truly mature, positive, and helpful to all parties in any relationship of any nature.

For example, see the comments section appended to this review.<br /><br />WH Auden's poem Funeral Blues is arguably one of the most brilliant poems of loss ever written - vide the last stanza:<br /><br />\\"The stars are not wanted now: put out every one;<br />Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun;<br />Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood,<br />For nothing now can ever come to any good.\\"<br /><br />One would expect Audenesque commentary on Shakespeare to be magisterial. But the views attributed to Auden in this book, which book in fact is stated in the preface to be a compilation of *lecture notes taken by students*, leave me with the impression that what we have here is seriously compromised material with which WH Auden himself might take strong issue.<br /><br />I will confine this review to three points on Auden's [?] assessment of the play Hamlet (Shakespeare's master work), because this assessment characterizes all that seems askew with this book.<br /><br />1. \\"I would question whether anyone has succeeded in playing Hamlet without appearing ridiculous.... Hamlet, the one inactive character, is not well integrated into the play and not adequately motivated, though the active characters are excellent\\" (pages 159, 162).<br /><br />If you've seen the Kenneth Branagh version of Hamlet (or are well read in Hamlet), you understand how inexplicable that first remark is. Next, Hamlet refuses to \\"cast to earth\\" his mourning clothes in defiance of accepted norms and the King's command; he then pursues and speaks with his father's ghost against his friends' urgent pleading; he then resolves to avenge his murdered father, conceives of the mousetrap play \\"to catch the conscience of the king\\", savagely berates his mother (Act III sc 4) after slaying Polonius, foils the deadly scheme of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, engineers their deaths, out-fences Laertes then climactically avenges his father by slaying the \\"adulterate and incestuous\\" King Claudius. Hamlet *does* all these things and these actions *all* involve activity on every plane - but we're to understand he is \\"the one INactive\\" character?<br /><br />2. \\"The soliloquies of Hamlet as well as other plays of this period are *detachable* both from the character and the plays.... Hamlet's disgust and revulsion towards his mother, for example, seem out of all proportion to her actual behavior\\" (page 162).<br /><br />Again, is it conceivable WH Auden really could have said this? Let's examine the play: The ghost of Hamlet's father states that Hamlet's mother had an extramarital affair with her husband's brother, (the fratricidal Claudius), and that this moral lapse led directly to King Hamlet's death. The consequences of the queen's adultery implicate her both in the murder of Hamlet's father and the consequent moral poisoning of all Denmark. Further, her marriage to her brother-in-law in the medieval-Renaissance context of the play is a public scandal and \\"incestuous\\". Moreover, her decision to marry while still in mourning led to Hamlet's not becoming King. Do such unfortunate events justify Hamlet's anger with his mother - \\"in all proportion\\"? (If someone destroyed your family, your career, and your country, would your being angry \\"seem out of all proportion\\"?) For brevity, I omit refuting the questionable remarks about the four soliloquies of Hamlet - the only detachable soliloquy is the \\"To be or not to be\\", which nevertheless is perfectly apropos.<br /><br />3. \\"Ophelia is a silly, repressed girl and is obscene and embarrassing when she loses her mind over her father's death.  But though her madness is very shocking and horrible, it is not well motivated\\" (page 163).<br /><br />Had Auden forgotten what this play was about since reading it as an Oxford undergraduate - or was he misquoted? (Would Auden have considered anyone profoundly moved by his own Funeral Blues as similarly \\"obscene\\", \\"repressed\\", and \\"silly\\"? My guess is not.) As written, the play indicates Ophelia is desperately in love with Hamlet - the sort of transporting passion for which women have been known to give up empires and even their lives. Her father and brother both repeatedly impress upon Ophelia that this man she desperately loves is just flirting her to bed her, and that she certainly isn't good enough for him; she discovers Hamlet has apparently gone mad, presumably because of love for her - love thwarted by her father's cynicism; she is compelled - again by her father - to allow herself to be humiliated by having her intimate love letter from Hamlet read before the King and Queen; she is next compelled - again by her father - to attempt to entrap Hamlet, which attempt seriously backfires and provokes him into a fury of towering jealous rage; finally, Ophelia learns Hamlet has murdered her father.<br /><br />Is it OBVIOUS this \\"silly, repressed girl\\" believes her beloved Hamlet murdered her father because of Hamlet's frustrated love for her - and that somehow she is to blame? Is it OBVIOUS Ophelia now can never marry Hamlet, her father's murderer, even if she wanted to? Is it OBVIOUS her \\"following\\" Hamlet in madness is an awful testimony of the power of cynicism and lies to destroy a woman's heart? No, none of this is obvious (apparently?) to WH Auden.<br /><br />I emphasize that the specious trains of reasoning above - attributed to WH Auden - are not confined to assessments of Hamlet. The Taming of the Shrew is described as \\"the only play of Shakespeare's that is a complete failure\\" (page 63). Similarly odd are the remarks on Othello, eg: \\"It's easy for us to see that Othello and Desdemona should not have married, but he [Othello] never does\\" (page 205).<br /><br />WH Auden has been described as a sardonic Oxonian. Perhaps his irony escaped his \\"gaping sluggish auditors\\"? It beggars belief that this book of *redacted student lecture notes* provides an accurate mirror of WH Auden's literary insight into Shakespeare: the literary views expressed in this book are \\"dumbth\\" and indefensible.<br /><br />Recommended as a book to lay down and avoid.?

Endless Libido might have been more apropos. But that's the story's message: What happens when the pagan gods of lust and love fuse indistinguishably? Here, the epiphany demolishes the teen protagonist. This is a passion play fueled by rampant Sadean libido, sublimated Petrachan love, the Tristan-Isolde theme, and the spiritual vacuum of modernism. Beautiful lyric narrative clothes the lower and higher forces of lust and love in kaleidoscopic nuances of physical shade and texture. Possessed by forces beyond his control or comprehension, the protagonist descends into Mephistophelian nightmare and Orwellian 1984 denouement. The story, in other words, is a testament to the transcendence of love. But lacking a strong spiritual center as the protagonist clearly does, his love inevitably degenerates to passion, to lust, to madness:<br /><br />\\"Of course when you love someone it is a tireless passion to experience their pleasure, especially sexual pleasure. Of all the many perversions, the one I found myself most capable of succumbing to was voyeurism - as long as the object of my voyeurism was Jade. I never failed to be moved by her expressions of sexual pleasure. When we were first learning to make love and I had some trouble in controlling myself, she had to be careful to keep as quiet as possible. Even heavy breathing would speed my climax, not to even mention moans. Later in our life together, when we were making love three, four, and five times a night (for our passion grew with our prowess), Jade would sometimes become impatient for my final orgasm - which would come with more difficulty than hers, because of the natural differences between the genders - and to bring us safely home so we both might fall asleep she would feign groans of pleasure with her lips right next to my ear, or say my name. It wouldn't really take anything more than that\\" (page 313).<br /><br />\\"The pain of love.\\"pain of love.\\"	2004-03-04
US	52957589	R17SSQNEV6ZIY9	0811203506	750407831	The Cantos of Ezra Pound (New Directions Books)	Books	5	65	80	N	N	"Make it new"	1. THE BACKGROUND<br />Harold Bloom observes in his book The Western Canon that for major literary heavyweights Dante Alighieri tends to be the role model. Joseph Campbell observes as much regarding James Joyce: \\"The model for Joyce's life was Dante\\". Dante felt strongly that educated people have a duty to assist practically in the betterment of humanity. Being a mere aesthete, for Dante, was burying one's talents at best and moral cowardice in the face of the enemy at worst. Pound accepted Dante's challenge. Throughout the Cantos Pound wages war on the perennial demonic forces always endangering the home, environment, culture, and representative government. The Cantos are a poetic attack strategy for recognizing and overcoming such forces. Often autobiographical, the Cantos also chronicle  Pound's odyssey through the tumultuous twentieth century. The work commences by invoking the muses in an immemorial Ulysses quest (Canto I), then serially time-travels through European culture via paratactic histories and biographies of heroes who successfully (or unsuccessfully) combated the blind demonic forces of cultural barbarism and hedonism. In this sense, the Cantos are a modern-day Plutarch's Lives - history interpreted by a poet.<br /><br />2. THE CRISES<br />Pound's first personal crisis followed the First World War, in which many of his own friends died. \\"I sought to discover what causes war\\", he said. His conclusion after years of exhaustive historical research was that wars are fomented by elite power groups: Corrupt government officials colluding with militarists, industrialists, and international bankers for their own personal (and treasonous) gain. It was then that both the Cantos' character, and Pound's character, changed (somewhere around Canto 45, the famous-infamous Usury Canto). Pound's study of history taught him that *rates of interest* are an accurate gauge to the civilization or barbarity of any culture: High levels of interest, usury, correspond to levels of philistine barbarism in which the weak are devoured by the strong. Pound's view became that social Darwinism, political economy, rampant capitalism, and debasement of currency are all destroyers of home, environment, culture, and honest government. The key demon, then, to be summoned and exorcized in Pound's poetic grimoire was \\"Greed\\" - Mammon. It was natural given this view for Pound to be attracted to Confucianism, with its accent on the home and family as the central hub from which all virtue and therefore true culture radiate. A large part of the Cantos is taken up with Pound's presentation of Confucian precepts.<br /><br />During the thirties, Pound crafted the American or \\"Adams\\" cantos, which laud American democratic values and the Founding Fathers' creation of a true republic. Armed with his knowledge of Western cultural history, Pound clearly foresaw the oncoming Second World War. He engaged in extensive and articulate letter-writing campaigns with several US senators, urging avoidance of all foreign entanglements, as had George Washington. During the war Pound - having failed to leave Italy before his visa expired and finding himself trapped in fascist Italy - engaged in a series of polemical and highly idiosyncratic radio broadcasts, slamming this latest world war as nothing more than another example of the economically powerful preying on the naivete of the politically weak. (Unfortunately for Pound and his message, he also argued what is clearly an anti-Jewish interpretation of history in these broadcasts. In many he does not sound at all cogent.) Pound wrote only two cantos during this time, the Italian Cantos, but the sense of the broadcasts is already clear in those cantos preceding the war.<br /><br />Pound's second personal crisis followed the Second World War. Once the war ended, the sixty year-old Ezra Pound was incarcerated in a gorilla cage, lying on cold concrete, left to the open air, with a night-time spotlight shining on him as he tried to sleep. Pound had made powerful political enemies: His incarcerators were not sadistic fascists but the victorious US Army in Pisa, Italy. It was here, incarcerated in Pisa, that Pound wrote the Pisan Cantos, which would earn him the first Bollingen Prize of 1948. By the time of the award, however, Pound was already a political prisoner in St Elizabeth's mental hospital in Washington, DC. Based on subsequent assertions of Pound's attorney, Pound was in no danger of the US government's treason charge. But Pound's wife, to protect him at all costs, opted to have Ezra committed in St Elizabeth's rather than risk his facing a possible capital charge of treason in time of war for his wartime radio broadcasts. It was during his twelve-year stay in St Elizabeth's that Pound would write the Rock-Drill and Thrones sections of the Cantos, and St Elizabeth's would become a site of pilgrimage for poets and authors from all countries.<br /><br />3. THE TRUTHS<br />The simple truth is Pound's anti-Jewish sentiments aside, Pound was right on all points. What we watch daily on television is exactly what Pound warned us was coming. His analysis of the debasement of US political will and honor through the 1913 creation of the Federal Reserve is now confirmed by many (US Representative Ron Paul, film maker Aaron Russo, and many many other authors and concerned citizens); \\"endless war\\"; fiscal corruption; the destruction of millions of lives in the name of \\"Mammon\\" - about all these things Pound warned us.<br /><br />The simple truth also is Pound's works languish in US English departments. When he is invoked it's usually to be denigrated. The ignorance of liberal arts professors of the import of Pound's political and economic messages would be funny were it not so ghastly: Eisenhower's farewell address; USMC Commandant Smedley Butler's essay War is a Racket; FDR's now-proven foreknowledge of the Pearl Harbor attack; the six million deaths caused by the US paramilitary since 1947; the proposed fake terror of Operation Northwoods; the daylight assassination of the only American president to oppose and attempt to abolish the Federal Reserve Bank; the faked Gulf of Tonkin incident used to justify the Vietnam War; the Saturday Night Massacre; the Wag the Dog spectacle of modern US politics; the infiltration of the US media in Operation Mockingbird; the current endless war for endless peace: the Pentagon's \\"loss\\" of 2.3 trillion dollars; US ambassador to Iraq Paul Bremer's \\"loss\\" of nine billion dollars of taxpayers' dollars during his brief one-year tenure - and receiving a Presidential Medal of Freedom for his service; Douglas Feith's Office of Strategic Plans that lied the US into war with Iraq and then awarded \\"no-bid\\" contracts to his long-standing business clients Northrup Grumman, Lockheed-Martin, et alia - Pound warned us of all these nightmares and prophesied their coming.<br /><br />4. THE MESSAGE<br />The Poundian Message is clear. War corrupts and destroys the home, environment, culture, and representative government. It does this in almost all cases to enrich the strong at the cost of the weak. War is a tool of Mammon, and when you hear \\"endless war\\" touted you are hearing your own death knell and that of all you love. You should familiarize yourself with Eustace Mullin's Secrets of the Federal Reserve and the online film Zeitgeist (errors aside, it asks the right questions) to grasp how far Ezra Pound's understanding of economics outstrips most English professors who genteelly stand above the fray. I once described Pound's economic ideas to a neighbor, an economist, and his immediate reply was, \\"That's right. He's exactly right.\\"<br /><br />The Cantos are beautiful and diaphanous (even the tedious sections are impeccably crafted) but they are often dense. Pound meant every word he wrote. The profundity and sincerity expressed in his poetry is clear. As such, the Cantos, like Pound's life, are a document of personal courage.<br /><br />Good luck on your odyssey - \\"And then went down to the ship / Set keel to breakers, forth on the godly sea...\\"; the proposed fake terror of Operation Northwoods; the daylight assassination of the only American president to oppose and attempt to abolish the Federal Reserve Bank; the faked Gulf of Tonkin incident used to justify the Vietnam War; the Saturday Night Massacre; the Wag the Dog spectacle of modern US politics; the infiltration of the US media in Operation Mockingbird; the current endless war for endless peace: the Pentagon's \\"loss\\" of 2.3 trillion dollars; US ambassador to Iraq Paul Bremer's \\"loss\\" of nine billion dollars of taxpayers' dollars during his brief one-year tenure - and receiving a Presidential Medal of Freedom for his service; Douglas Feith's Office of Strategic Plans that lied the US into war with Iraq and then awarded \\"no-bid\\" contracts to his long-standing business clients Northrup Grumman, Lockheed-Martin, et alia - Pound warned us of all these nightmares and prophesied their coming.<br /><br />4.

He was also a World War Two veteran with a keen appreciation of Ezra Pound's astute assessments of twentieth century US militarism. We spoke at his home several times about Ezra Pound and about this book of scholarly exegesis. Professor Terrell said he spent six years preparing it with the help of English graduate students who collated his notes and assisted his research of recondite Poundian references. A Companion to The Cantos is a cornerstone of every Poundian library. Professor Terrell provides an annotation for nearly all the literary, religious, architectural, and historical references Pound consistently invokes throughout the Cantos. Like James Joyce's Finnegans Wake, the Cantos are nearly unintelligible without a companion reference; so for serious study this text is an excellent resource. It is hard to conceive penetration of the Cantos without it.<br /><br />Another fine but far briefer reference is William Cookson's [[ASIN:0892552468 A Guide to the Cantos of Ezra Pound, Revised Edition]]. Unlike Terrell, Cookson concentrates less on Poundian vocabulary and more on the broad historical sweep of the Cantos. The two books together provide a master key.	2003-10-22

The last five chapters focus on his son, Merlin, and are well characterized by Merlin's statement, \\"I'm not in the same league as my father\\". Picture Homer's Odyssey with the entire second half devoted to Telemachus. Perhaps Zelazny had done better to have synchronous plots going on here with both characters. From chapter six on, the tale slowly decelerates with Merlin. In fact, it's the expansion of the plot complications and range of characters already encountered in the first half of the book that makes Merlin's yawning yarn sustainable. Compared with Corwin's judgment and shrewd cunning, Merlin's decisions are unsure, his actions intuitive - basically, he's frequently a bore. That said, this is fantastic fantasy even if fantasy's not your fancy.<br /><br />The Great Book of Amber is not without authorial and editorial flaws but nevertheless I found it addictive and stayed bleary-eyed until I finished it, in just a few days. It reminds me of The Pattern mentioned many times in the book: Once you dare to start you dare not stop till you reach the end. This book holds up well to rereading and it a great \\"get away from it all\\" story. That said, I consider Zelazny's [[ASIN:0060567236 Lord of Light]] much stronger material.	2001-02-01

(above) is simply wrong. What this book IS is a collection of papers on the topic of using various computational methodologies  - primarily ab initio and density functional - to predict NMR chemical shifts. It is very useful obviously for computational chemists. If you are not a computational chemist, or if you are seeking information on NMR *techniques*, this book is not for you. Also, if you seek a concise technical description on how to run computational calculations, here again this book is not for you.<br /><br />What the entire set of papers in this book distill down to is use of UNIX-based software packages such as Gaussian 94 to generate geometry-optimized conformers whose cartesians are then exported into the SP NMR mode of Gaussian 94 to determine the NMR isotropic chemical shift tensors. There are numerous descriptions of the applicability of various methodologies to various chemical systems - polymers, crystals, olefins, etc.<br /><br />The twenty-three chapters include such jewels as: Effects of Hydrogen Bonding on 1H Chemical Shifts, Ab Initio Calculations of 31P NMR Chemical Shielding Anisotropy Tensors in Phosphates: The Effect of Geometry on Shielding, and last but definitely not least, Recent Advances in Nuclear Magnetic Shielding Theory and Computational Methods. My own work in this area suggests that although Gaussian 94 ab initio analysis does a good job generating isotropic tensors that are predictive of chemical shift, computational accuracy may well break down on the introduction of multiple bonding (using Hartree-Fock theory on a 6-31G* basis set.)	2000-12-23
US	52957589	R3MQ9Z2W8M54HN	0679600116	705442339	Ulysses (Modern Library 100 Best Novels)	Books	5	6	7	N	N	June 16, 1904	Ulysses does not throw out the welcome mat. Indeed, the book hardly seems to notice you as you trudge its Dublin streets with Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom. James Joyce spent seven years in composition (1914-1921), and a really thorough and thoughtful first reading (consulting numerous references meanwhile) can easily take more than a year. The entire book chronicles just one day (June 16, 1904).<br /><br />In Ulysses, Joyce further refines his stream-of-consciousness narrative technique already mastered in the Portrait. Ulysses also is written in Joyce's signature \\"dramatic style\\" (ie, fiction that has no author's comments to help orient you). These two traits - stream-of-consciousness narrative and dramatic style - make Joyce hard to read at least at first for some people. And the occasional savage wordplay of Ulysses (wholly tame by the standard of Finnegans Wake) can quickly disorient - \\"con-trans-magnificand-jew-bang-tantiality\\". Nevertheless, once you've grasped Joyce's style it's a pleasure that's always fresh.<br /><br />As do the Portrait and Wake, Ulysses redefines the concept of \\"reading\\" a book. Joyce develops hyper-realistic atmospheres in each chapter through stream-of-consciousness narrative and/or drastic changes in style. For example, in the \\"Cyclops\\" chapter, the style crescendoes with biblical intensity up to a hilarious apocalyptic finale, followed at once by the \\"Nausicaa\\" chapter, which is written in the sentimental style of a Victorian girl's magazine. (Imagine the bone-jarring bathos of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony instantly followed by the theme song to the children's program Barney.) This goes on non-stop till the final chapter of Molly Bloom falling asleep - a chapter of dark earthiness composed of seven immense sentences. The novel's overall effect is Plato's \\"intelligible sphere whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere\\". Big claim but Joyce makes it happen.<br /><br />Mark Twain remarked \\"a great book is a book everyone wants *to have* read and no one wants *to* read\\". Initially unwelcoming, Ulysses is \\"a book to be enjoyed over and over again\\", as Joseph Campbell stated. Helpful references are Joseph Campbell's six audiocassette lectures, Wings of Art, and Stuart Gilbert's book, James Joyce's Ulysses. Like Joyce, Campbell was a Roman Catholic apostate and was very in sympatico with Joyce's literary projects and ideas. While I deplore Joyce's and Campbell's lack of authentic religion and their descent into the meaninglessness of agnostic Modernism, Joyce's fiction is superb.<br /><br />(Perhaps) the twentieth century's greatest work of English fiction.ryone wants *to have* read and no one wants *to* read\\".

The perfect counterpoint to Le Morte d'Arthur. The Arthurian legends are wonderful tales but they are mythic literary productions. Mark Twain gives them a good old-fashioned strapping out behind the outhouse. With the Connecticut Yankee as our guide, we have front row seats on everyday life in Arthurian Britain: White slavery, le droit de seigneur, confiscation of property in event of suicide, nonexistence of impartial justice, the (unintended) degrading influence of Catholicism on the masses, immense ignorance, superstition... And that's just day one. But Mark Twain will never leave you stranded in a dark hell hole. Oh no - brilliance, mirth, and devastating common sense are always surrounding you on any journey with Mark Twain. This book is classic Twain: Funny.<br /><br />A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is chock-full of brilliant Twainisms. My favorite is his observation that a conscience is a very uncomfortable thing to have, and the significant difference between a conscience and an anvil is that, if you had an anvil stuck inside you, it would be a lot less uncomfortable than having a conscience. And Twain clearly concurs with Tom Paine that the English nobility were \\"no-ability\\" - simply the latest in a perennial series of robbers making life miserable for everyone and doing all in their power to hang on to power. A fine modern treatment of this theme is Ken Follett's [[ASIN:0451207149 The Pillars of the Earth]]. Twain also mentions the beautiful mispronunciations of childhood, and how the bereaved parental ear listens in vain for them once the child has grown.<br /><br />You'll never look at castles the same again (and I suspect the Dark Ages will never know what hit them).	2000-12-05

Joyce had a flair for foreign languages, regarded Catholicism as \\"a beautiful lie\\", had at his disposal the collective wisdom of East and West, was *extremely* well read, gifted in music, delighted in wordplay, extensively researched the psychology of sleep, and was notoriously autobiographical in his literary productions.<br /><br />Joyce describes a night's dream in both biographical (Freudian) and archetypal (Jungian) terms: Brother against brother conflict, inevitable haunting guilt (\\"this municipal sin business\\"), raging lust percolating through \\"the fury and the mire of human veins\\", chrysalis-like psychological dependence on (temporal and ecclesiastical) authority, ultimate redemption through love, inevitable death. These motifs characterize both human history and tomorrow morning's news. And so, the Wake is *our* dream: Each of us is the poor harried protagonist Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker, subjected to the cold patrician ridicule of the Four Customers and Twelve Jurymen and burdened by guilt and the misplaced faith of our personal and collective innocence.<br /><br />Those with little patience for Joyce's presentation are not willing to reassess what a book should convey or else lack a herculean desire for wordplay. In defence of detractors, knowledge of at least one foreign language probably helps, as does general knowledge of comparative religion and mythology, Vico's historical cycles, Nietzsche's eternal recurrence, alchemy, Biblical tales, children's games, the history of English literature, etc. Perhaps the greatest obstacle to approaching the Wake is that many readers come in bad faith, unwilling to believe that an order is there, hidden in the obscure labyrinth of protean wordplay.<br /><br />If you want to turn the lead of the Wake into gold, then you must be a modern-day alchemist. And do not expect to complete the Great Work without much meditation and effort.hidden in the obscure labyrinth of protean wordplay.

This book presents the encounter of two new empires (rising in the power vacuum left by the collapse of the former galactic government, which Seldon predicted): One empirical, one mystical.<br /><br />Hari Seldon is long dead. Two gifted men, Golan Trevize and Stor Gendibal from the First and Second Foundations, respectively, (both cultures founded by Hari Seldon in opposite corners of the galaxy on opposite philosophical premises) find themselves catapulted into intragalactic mayhem by the machinations of their political rivals. They will meet with catalytic force seeking to discover the hidden power moving galactic politics. Trevize (empiricist) suspects Second Foundation political influence while Gendibal (mystic) intuits a deeper, far more elusive force at work. (Gendibal's right.)<br /><br />Foundation's Edge strains credibility in its intricate plot twists, but because Stor Gendibal has mastered Hari Seldon's hyper-reality psychohistorical equations AND a newly-developed mystical science of titanic psionics, perhaps not. Deep minds' fusion of magic and science makes for a great plot device, as the George Lucas franchise has conclusively shown.<br /><br />If you've read the earlier Foundation volumes you'll probably want to read this --- another good read to get away from it all.	2000-10-16

The book is a model of clarity. The presentation is crystal clear: Symmetry elements and operations, groups, matrices (primarily useful for computer simulations), spectroscopy, etc. The only proviso being the final chapter on the Woodward-Hoffman rules is neither clear nor helpful. Each chapter ends with a series of questions (answers in back) of what you've just been presented. Character tables and correlation tables are included. The comparison of Raman and IR spectral data is well covered, as is the construction of molecular orbital energy level diagrams. Numerous examples include trans-butadiene, octahedral metal complexes, nitrite and carbonate ions, etc.<br /><br />Cotton's book on this topic, though considered a classic, really is more of a virtuosic acrobatic performance directed to academic colleagues rather than toward assisting tyros or working chemists hoping or needing to master this recondite field of chemistry.

His new project is development of a galactic knowledge repository (similar to the Great Library of Alexandria or the US National Archives) where all knowledge will be stored for future generations against the impending collapse of galactic civilization, (which Seldon's psychohistorical equations have predicted accurately). Building on his psychohistorical knowledge of the future, Seldon establishes two \\"Foundation\\" outposts in opposite and extremely remote corners of the galaxy. He does this with galactic government financial backing - ostensibly to create \\"dictionaries\\" - but the galactic government is only told of one of these Foundation outposts; the other outpost \\"is not on any of the star charts\\", (which becomes significant in later volumes of the Foundation tales).<br /><br />As usual, Asimov's poor ear for dialogue never gets in the way of his rich storytelling.

The style is clear and plain, but overall this book would be improved by more attention paid to actual tasks than to commands per se, especially since some of these commands (to a newcomer) are cryptic. Nevertheless by taking notes and highlighting the index, it's easy enough to navigate this book. There's a helpful listing of major UNIX commands in the back. The book covers \\"getting started\\" (logging on and off, etc.), file and directory basics, UNIX tools (basic 'vi' stuff - the text editor), command customization, C/Korn/Bash shells, multitasking, the Internet and e-mail, FTP, shell and C++ programming basics, and system administration.<br /><br />As the authors state, the book is kept brief (397 pages) to ensure simple delivery of what's most needed to get started pushing buttons. The format is similar to Who's Afraid of C++? in that it tries to be user-friendly by supplying small quizzes and simple tasks at each chapter's conclusion to ensure you've grasped the basic ideas presented. This book can prove to be a life saver in any situation involving molecular orbital calculations involving UNIX navigation (C shell). Overall, this is a sympathetic and clear-cut introduction to UNIX.	2000-09-26

Keneally is a good writer, but his dustjacket photo sporting a great big grin and a cowboy hat seems a less-than-ideal choice given the grave subject matter of this book. You learn several things about Oskar Schindler in Keneally's book that help you appreciate the Spielberg film:<br /><br />1. Schindler was a successful race care driver as a young man with immense personal magnetism.<br /><br />2. Schindler was a member of Admiral Canaris' Abwehr, the German Secret Service, the Nazi counterpart of the CIA. So Schindler's \\"powerful friends\\" weren't just shmoozed SS officers; they were members of an extremely powerful wing of the German intelligence establishment. Unlike the thugs of the Gestapo and the atheistic racists of the SS, the Abwehr was typically composed of level-headed, well educated, well connected gentlemen. And the Abwehr was no friend of either the Gestapo or the SS. (And of course the shmoozed SS officers that were Schindler's friends looked out for him, also.) So Schindler's protection was doubly redundant. And of course there was his personal friend General Schindler - no relative  - but no doubt a help if need arose, and a wonderful namedropping opportunity.<br /><br />3. Schindler decided early on in the war (contrary to the film's dramatic premise) to help his Jewish workers, taking trips secretly to Hungary and Turkey to alert foreign powers of the Nazi agenda, which he witnessed first-hand.<br /><br />4. Schindler was arrested by the Gestapo three times, and each time it was more and more of a closer call. The film shows the second arrest, but Keneally maintains the incarcerated soldier sharing Schindler's cell was an SS man; in the film he wears an Army (Wehrmacht) uniform. And the off-color joke was real, as was the little girl in the red jacket.<br /><br />5. Schindler lived in South America after the war, eventually abandoning his wife there. (The Spielberg film concludes stating Schindler \\"failed\\" at his marriage. Abandonment would certainly qualify.) He spent the rest of his life living off the charity of the former Schindler Jews who took  great pains to care for him.<br /><br />6. Schindler suffered intense ostracism in Germany after the war once his heroism on behalf of the Jews became known, but eventually he was  recognized as a hero and received several civil commendations. And just as Spielberg relates, Schindler always was haunted by the horrible feeling that he \\"could have done more\\".<br /><br />While the movie is superior, the story goes that if it were not for Keneally's book, the Spielberg movie would never have been made. It was Keneally who happened to run into a former Schindler Jew (in, of all places, Hollywood), learned the story, and had the verve and talent to put that story to book.<br /><br />Informative, well-written book.failed\\" at his marriage.

But unlike Idiocracy, Fahrenheit 451 is no satire. It is serious social criticism without a glimmer of humor. Bradbury's fictional world is a fascist state built on what NeoCon Philip Zelikow calls \\"public presumption\\", \\"public myth\\" --- shared ideas assumed to be true but not known to be true. In other words, reality is what a government says it is. Bradbury's fictional world shares much, therefore, in common with George Orwell's novel 1984.<br /><br />The plot is built around the awaking conscience of a government employee, a firefighter who has always accepted public presumption as truth. The awakening is not pretty. Guy Montag, the protagonist, begins to question his culture: Mindless entertainment, disrespect for life, constant motion. In Guy Montag's culture, the public presumption is that books are a potential terrorist threat. The job of firefighters, therefore, is to seek out and burn books. Given recent developments in US politics and society, Fahrenheit 451 --- like Orwell's 1984 --- has become more trenchant with each passing year. Bradbury explores the longterm moral and social implications of our present Zeitgeist.	2000-09-07

The latest second edition includes additional  material on waves, which addresses a lack in the earlier edition. There are  sections on optics, momentum, kinetic and potential energy, etc. My  favorite problem, and this is typical of the sort of material presented, is to decide whether or not a car traveling at 50 mph suffers more damage in:<br /><br />A. hitting an immovable brick wall<br /><br />B. having a head-on collision with an identical car (both) traveling at 50 mph<br /><br />The usual response is to say B. However, Newton's 3rd law of motion (\\"forces always act in  pairs - if a exerts a force on b, then b exerts an equal and oppositely-directed force on a) maintains that the damage is the same, ie, the wall strikes the car with the force of a head-on collision. This problem by the way is particularly juicy - I remember the head of a university physics department discussing this one at considerable length with two other physicists. (They more or less agreed, with provisos, after several minutes, that B. is indeed the correct answer.) The author encourages thinking without mathematics to come to terms with the physical reality of whatever we're analyzing. This approach closely mirrors that of Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell, who felt that mathematics was useful only as an adjunct to science and no substitute for clear thinking. A marvellous book.	2000-08-15

For example, \\"Self-praise is only allowable when deserved recognition has been  unjustly withheld; in all other cases, it is both in bad taste and  demoralizing.\\" That is about all I am fit to comment on: My System is a classic. Nimzovich expounds basic concepts of chess strategy, particularly the idea of the blockade, and provides numerous examples within the text supported by a collection of games at the end. This is an ideal book for any literate beginner, particularly as familiarity with his ideas distills the essence of the game down to several key principles. Nimzovich cuts through the confusion and explains the game in terms of his systematic approach to positional play. Moreover, Nimzovich emphasizes the aesthetics and beauty of the game.<br /><br />Great chess book and a model of clarity.	2000-08-15

Unlike any other book in English literature, James Joyce's [[ASIN:0141181265 Finnegans Wake (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)]] is written entirely on the level of dream consciousness. Joycean scholar John Bishop has tightly focused his attention solely on the *dream* and *sleep* aspects of Finnegans Wake. While this makes for a rather monochromatic presentation sometimes bordering the banal, the scholarship, clarity, and thrust of Bishop's presentation are indisputable. There's so much depth and breadth in Finnegans Wake that Bishop's restrained scholarship is required to understand just this one aspect of it.<br /><br />From Bishop's text, pages 4-7: \\"Suppose we charged ourselves with the task of  providing in chronological order a detailed account of everything that  occurred to us NOT last night ... but in the first half-hour of last night's sleep. The 'hole affair' [535.20], (and a 'hole', unlike a 'whole', has no content), will likely summon up a sustained 'blank memory' [515.33]: 'You  wouldn't should as youd remesner, I hypnot' [360.23-24]. What would become equally obscure, even questionable, is the stability of identity... No one remembers the experience of sleep at all as a sequence of events linked chronologically in time by cause and effect.\\"<br /><br />Joyce remarked to his friend William Bird: \\"About my new work - do you know, Bird, I confess I can't understand some of my critics, like Pound or Miss Weaver, for instance. They say it's *obscure*. They compare it, of course, with Ulysses. But the action of Ulysses was chiefly in the daytime, and the action of my new work takes place chiefly at night. It's natural things should not be so clear at night, isn't it now?\\"<br /><br />Bishop's book is superb scholarship and a major key to understanding the dream and sleep aspects of Finnegans Wake.	2000-08-08
US	52957589	R3F25JN2YTRBCK	0394716728	204557370	The Fourth Way: An Arrangement by Subject of Verbatim Extracts from the Records of Ouspensky's Meetings in London and New York, 1921-46	Books	5	15	23	N	N	One-stop shop for higher awareness	I encountered PD Ouspensky's writings as a young man. The usual first reaction is shock, as was mine. The Work is a powerful set of psychological techniques and disciplines designed ultimately to bestow \\"clear vision\\",  ie, \\"objective consciousness\\". Each chapter in this book reads about an hour. Ouspensky displays brilliance and complete mastery fielding questions from Fourth Way students. There is no doubt that an acquaintance with these ideas is salutary. On the other hand, the Work has its dark side:<br /><br />1. Almost any remarkable individual of any era is implicitly assumed to have been a devotee of this particular system: Beethoven, Mozart, Shakespeare, Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, Jesus, Plato, Buddha - the list goes on.<br /><br />2. It is problematic whether The Work actually develops moral character to any appreciable degree. The crude notion we are all \\"machines\\" (old news, read Pavlov) does not foster compassion for our fellow man nor develop moral character, which are the foundation of a healthy psychology. The crude notion that it's okay to lie as long as we call it \\"intentional  insincerity\\" - what do we make of that?<br /><br />3. Ouspensky's assertions to the contrary notwithstanding, it *is* a depressing system: \\"Man has no soul\\" - a radical break with all major religious and mystical traditions. You have just one lifetime to build your soul, say Ouspensky and Gurdjieff, and if you fail what's left of you becomes \\"food for the Moon\\". And *only* The Work can save you from such a ghastly fate.<br /><br />4. Even the notion of non-identification with negative emotional states, a wonderful insight and tool, does not guarantee personal growth of character: One learns a few disciplines and attitudes to ameliorate their severity then performs mental gymnastics to wipe out the residue. I think it likely that one has simply sidestepped the whole issue of what it means to be morally strong and emotionally mature in such a  procedure. But then it *is* the \\"way of the sly man\\".<br /><br />In short, you are unlikely to meaningfully develop as a self-responsible moral agent following this system. More likely, you will judge that you know better than everyone else - a prideful practitioner of situational morality, in other words. In different words, an unprincipled opportunist. That's my opinion. And, at the end, where *you* really are after all the mandated inner manipulation...

And if you want familiarity with high paganism this book certainly should be on your study list. The crucial issue explored here is Theurgy. As Taylor remarks, it appears to have been an element of orthodox ancient religion that has become lost to modernity. Theurgists presumably were able through long years of training to invoke angels and deities. One is reminded of the communion of saints in the Apostles Creed. Similar ideas also arise in connection with the purported grimoire of Pope Honorious, the Heptameron, and in the ceremonial magic of the Golden Dawn and Joseph Lisiewski.<br /><br />A very humorous technique employed by Iamblichus is to set up his text as a dialogue-by-mail from the Greek philosopher Porphyry to the Egyptian priest Anebo; the Greek's assertions and questions are followed by the Egyptian's replies. And as the Egyptians considered themselves far superior to the Greeks in all matters philosophical and mystical and magical and religious, it comes as no surprise at all that the Egyptian priest corrects the Greek on every occasion:<br /><br />\\"It must be granted  that there are gods\\", Porphyry opens.<br /><br />\\"Not so\\", counters the Egyptian priest. \\"An innate knowledge of the Gods is built into the very fabric of our very being, and so to frame the question thus, as though it could be disputed, is in error.\\" (This of course is a throwback to The Divine Pymander in which it is asserted that \\"Whatever can be seen has a creator\\".)<br /><br />If you wish to seriously study and appreciate this classic text of high paganism, you should obtain a copy of Manly P Hall's taped lecture on it from the Philosophical Research Society, Los Angeles, CA. Similarly, you might wish to consult the works of Donald Tyson and Israel Regardie. Also, the Prometheus Trust now publishes the collected works of Thomas Taylor in attractive volumes.	2000-08-07

Dr Maurice Nicoll's six-volume set, Psychological Commentaries on the Teaching of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky, is intended for a limited audience already *very* familiar with the writings of Ouspensky and Gurdjieff. The great expositor of Ouspensky, Nicoll brought on board material not only from CG Jung but also from the New Testament, where \\"repentance\\" is translated from the Greek \\"metanoia\\" - \\"change of thinking\\".<br /><br />The four pillars of The Work are:<br /><br />1. Self-remembering<br /><br />2. Self-observation<br /><br />3. Non-identification<br /><br />4. Non-expression of negativity<br /><br />If you are unfamiliar with what these signify, you don't need these volumes by Nicoll. Instead, see PD Ouspensky's [[ASIN:0394716728 The Fourth Way]]. The central tenets of The Work of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky are the same as those found (explicitly or implicitly) in all major religions read gnostically: Every individual lacks a central, permanent, unchangeable \\"I\\". This is the basis of Zen, alchemy, and all gnostic and mystical traditions. This curious psychological truth is exactly what  constitutes the force of \\"loving one's enemies\\" - one is  displaying a tour de force of psychological freedom and moral strength par excellence. This is indeed the reality underlying the paradoxical religious injunction that only through surrendering our will to something higher can we truly discover who we are.<br /><br />The Work is respectable business nowadays. It is perhaps dangerous for those lacking a sufficient background in subjects arcane, as the elegant power and demonstrable truth of its tenets easily overwhelm  newcomers. Nicoll is an excellent expositor, and these commentaries are an excellent exegesis.	2000-08-07

The plot is clear and wordplay, though outrageous, is minimal.<br /><br />Best suited to those familiar with basic ideas of the Gurdjieff work, Beelzebub's tales are related over several days' travel through space aboard a starship enroute to visit God. (Yes, that's right. To visit God.) In the story, Beelzebub is no fallen angel but rather a highly-evolved and highly moral entity who in ages past took issue with \\"certain unforeseeingnesses of certain Sacred Cosmic Individuals\\". Ahem. Banished to the planet Mars, Beelzebub made a millennium-long hobby of visits to Earth, during which he observed and documented the strange behavior and psychology of mankind, the so-called \\"three-brained terrestrial beings\\".<br /><br />Gurdjieff builds this book around a consistent and relentless dependent clause motif. This clearly turns the book into a  non-stop mnemonic exercise. Reading this book therefore does sharpen the memory and concentration. The style is infectious. You may find yourself thinking and speaking in elaborate dependent clauses for some considerable time after reading this book. Presumably Gurdjieff chose this style because he considered a central weakness of modern thinking (\\"the diminution of modern thinking\\") to be its brevity and habitual lack of psychological context. Here's my fictitious imitation of the book's style.

Are we detecting a pattern here - that authors procrastinate? Though \\"incomplete\\" this book is important reading for anyone interested in the Gurdjieff Work. For example, Gurdjieff gives a representative psychological exercise:<br /><br />Pay attention to your right hand. Lay it flat. Begin to count to ten with one finger, while you observe the emotional state of a second finger, while simultaneously observing the physical sensations of a third. (What exactly *is* the emotional state of a finger, I still ask myself.)<br /><br />The book's biography is interesting but Meetings with Remarkable Men is better in that regard, and Views from the Real World covers more psychological ground.	2000-08-07

The tale opens as a grumpy European traveler realizes he will not be getting to sleep, due to the intense heat and humidity of the Indian climate. Then, lo and  behold - it's the devil! And the devil, for reasons not too clear, shares his thoughts on humanity with the traveler. Ouspensky makes an interesting point that one man's meat is another devil's poison.<br /><br />Ouspensky presents an image of what the classical Greeks might call \\"terrestrial daemons\\", and what we have since learned are maleficent demons, as sentient spiritual energies busily concerned with keeping our interests occupied with the immediate here-and-now. For the demons, any spiritual attainment by human beings is mysterious, frightening, and wrong - the true consummate evil. So the industrious demons \\"help\\" us - to their way of thinking - by surreptitiously bending our ways to their ways.<br /><br />This story is clean, imaginative, and unpretentious. It resembles CS Lewis's The Screwtape Letters. While CS Lewis is more honest and makes the moral depravity of demons clear, Ouspensky simply treats demons as spiritual Shakespearean fools innocently bent on our destruction - as though that's what's best for us. This is unsurprising, as the philosophy of Ouspensky is totally devoid of any meaningful morality or theology - it's entirely an amoral psychological construct. In this respect, Ouspensky is a blind leader of the blind. But with that caveat, these stories are thought-provoking.	2000-08-06

Mine was a  limited edition hardcover by Chthonios Books. I did actually read most of this huger-than-life tome once upon a time.<br /><br />The format of Thomas Taylor's translation of the Commentaries of Proclus on the Timaeus of Plato (as you might expect) is a lengthy foreword by Taylor in which he vigorously defends the pagan mysteries then extensively footnotes Proclus' extensive commentaries throughout. Proclus sequentially examines a line or two of Plato's Timaeus followed by anywhere from several lines to several pages of his own valuable and insightful commentary. If you enjoy Plato's Timaeus you're nearly certain to enjoy this; but unless you're planning to do postgraduate work on Neoplatonism, this very beefy tome is perhaps best described as a book \\"for laying down and avoiding\\". The enormous amounts of Taylor material herein makes this book well worth the study, however (assuming a readable edition). Interesting is Taylor's observation that the circulation of the bloodstream was already mentioned in the Timaeus two millennia before William Harvey.<br /><br />The Prometheus Trust now publishes the complete works of Thomas Taylor in attractive hard covers.	2000-08-06

This book is also simple to use - it is identically paginated to the Wake so there is no confusing looking for the right page. Etymology is provided where necessary, and there are the usual plethora of allusions.

Appreciating the Wake certainly requires this book. Numerous linguistic influences on Joyce from various authors are catalogued. Particularly interesting is the  lengthy analysis of Lewis Carroll's literary influence on Joyce:<br /><br />1. Carroll is presumably the undisputed inventor of the portmanteau word - a word packed with multiple meanings. Carroll was content to have dual meaning but Joyce packed as many meanings as possible into his words.<br /><br />2. Carroll (like Joyce) worked with successive alterations of one letter in a word - meat, meet, mate, maze, etc. Sections of the Wake which obliquely referenced Carroll would routinely incorporate this technique.<br /><br />3. Alice served as an alterego for Joyce's heroine ALP, where \\"Wonderlawn\\" is code for the Garden of Eden.<br /><br />In short, Joyce found much in Carroll's work that (in the case of the portmanteau  word, to his surprise) neatly \\"dovetallied\\" with his own \\"work in progress\\". The Books at the Wake is a fascinating and well-written collection of many more such analyses (Shakespeare, Blake, Vico, etc.).	2000-08-02

Nothing comes close. Most books are simply uninformative, regurgitating ad nauseam old truisms about the golden mean and squaring the circle. Brunes' two volume study presents a tightly-argued and magnificently illustrated description of the prevalence of a standard geometrical pattern applied to works of western art and architecture throughout the millennia. The basic procedure used a square of known dimensions whose diagonal was subtended to the horizontal, (1:square root  of 2). This relationship was then elaborated to lay out the design of numerous sacred sites.<br /><br />The same patterns, clearly provided by Brunes, are present in works as far back as ancient Egypt up to the Gothic period. Particularly  fascinating are Notre Dame de Paris, Glastonbury Cathedral, the Parthenon and the Pyramids. Floor plans are provided with an overlay of the geometry and discussions of the standard planning method's application. While the  significance of the builders' method remains problematic, it would appear to have  been based on Pythagorean notions of the ability of geometrical pattern and  arithmetical canon to invoke corresponding spiritual influences.<br /><br />This  book has all the thrill of a good detective novel, and is a wonderful and  impressive read for anyone interested in this arcane topic's relevance to western religious architecture. A discussion of this method's connection to chess and written language is also included. If you want to locate this book quickly, my suggestion is Samuel Weiser's Antiquarian in York Beach, Maine.

For those who have watched The Power of Myth videos, and read several Joseph Campbell books, this  collection of high-power dialogues with Campbell is no disappointment. No intimate details are given of Campbell's life, however, When asked for autobiographical details during one session, Campbell responds (more or less): \\"That's biography, and I don't do biography\\".<br /><br />Campbell relays several anecdotes of his friends Robinson and Zimmer, and gives honorable mention to the Bollingen Press and Sarah Lawrence College for crucial assistance in his career development. Particularly of interest are the frequent remarks concerning, and discussions with, his wife (and former student) Jean Erdman.<br /><br />While many of Campbell's remarks are near-verbatim replies heard in The Power of Myth videos, some are unreleased gems: There are two kinds of people in this world - those who know their myth is a fact (the orthodox religious) and those who know their myth is a lie (the atheists)- both KNOW that their myth is most certainly NOT a metaphor. While insightful, Reader Be Warned that while Campbell is a magnificent Humanities guru he is an abysmal theologian - a Modernist who claimed God never spoke to man and that all religions are simply metaphors of a great unknown spiritual mystery.<br /><br />Good book.	2000-07-20

Crudely put, the major thrust of Joseph Campbell's and CG Jung's work was the unity of the human psyche throughout the world - that the ancient religions and traditions are psychologically relevant. Neither man, however, was an  adept of these systems, ie, neither pursued these systems to their obviously implied conclusions, instead contenting themselves with the (what is now) noncontroversial conclusion of psychological relevance. Jung was obviously at a loss to understand alchemical terms coherently, contenting himself with interpreting alchemy in Freudian and his own terms. Campbell maintained that God no longer speaks to mankind because He never DID speak to mankind.<br /><br />Thomas Taylor, on the other hand, \\"the  Great English Pagan\\", was thoroughly versed in the Platonic and Neoplatonic traditions and although he lacked the benefits of twentieth century scholarship, not only approached the essentially same conclusions as Campbell and Jung, but further concluded that there did exist at one time a religion of magical invocation. (See my review of Iamblichus on the Mysteries.) However incredible this idea might seem to us moderns, there are numerous examples from reliable, trustworthy witnesses (Plato, Plutarch, Iamblichus, Proclus) and other ancient sources - the Bible included (eg, the Witch of Endor summoning the spirit of Samuel for King Saul) that argue for this conclusion. Modern Rosicrucians and Golden Dawn adepts apparently concur, apparently arguing for a sober reappraisal of what we understand by the term \\"religion\\". St. Paul and St. Augustine would simply say the ancients were channeling demons.<br /><br />Taylor concurs with Campbell - both deniers of Christian revelation  - that the Christian religion has inadvertently charted strange and unknown seas by its insistence on the historicity of its symbolism. Unlike Campbell, Taylor is virulently anti-Christian, not only in the Nietzschean sense that Christianity has undermined true Spirituality by its insistence on the fallen nature of the physical world, but also because he considers it a selfishly motivated and bizarre perversion of high paganism. It is a characterization convincingly assaulted by many Christian scholars and authors: eg, see GK Chesterton's [[ASIN:1849025630 The Everlasting Man]]. It is questionable whether Taylor had any proper catechesis in, or knowledge of, authentic Christianity in any event.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this translation is to be highly commended as it is Taylor's.

So pardon if my review is heavily skewed in that direction. If Joyce doesn't interest you, you should perhaps skip this review.<br /><br />Deified by secular academia in the 1960s, Sigmund Freud has become increasingly disparaged - despite the circumspectness of his arguments - and his popularity become increasingly eclipsed by his student Carl Jung. But for readers of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake (clearly a small group) Freud is an invaluable resource for understanding dream consciousness: Eg, Freud suggests crucial ideas of a \\"universal grammar\\" of dream-consciousness. (See also the linguistic works of Noam Chomsky, and Leonard Bernstein's video lecture The Unanswered Question.)<br /><br />1. NO-NO<br />The subconscious doesn't understand negatives - (\\"no, not, never\\") - instead perceiving them as affirmations. Like Molly Bloom's repetitive \\"Yes\\" as she drifts off into sleep at the conclusion of Ulysses, Freud posits there is no negation in sleep. Rather, negation can only be expressed by the subconscious as ideas inverted or otherwise made insensible. (Joyceans, see Joseph Campbell's appraisal of Picasso's handling of mythic imagery).<br /><br />2. OPPOSITES<br />A vague idea may signify its opposite. Freud compares this to primitive proto-language etymology, in which either pole of an extreme is expressed by one and the same word. (Joyceans, see any page of Finnegans Wake and page 38 of Ulysses - \\"contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality\\").<br /><br />3. CONSUBSTANTIALITY<br />Conflation of ideas and persons is employed by the subconscious to short-circuit \\"inner censoring\\" and \\"prefrontal control\\". For example, supposedly-not-dreamed-about Mr A is indirectly indicated in a dream because Mr B appears in that dream wearing a hat usually associated with Mr A. (Joyceans, obviously this is the essence of Finnegans Wake.)<br /><br />Again, an invaluable resource for Joyceans. For all others interested in the dynamics of the subconscious, certainly well worth reading.n the dynamics of the subconscious, certainly well worth reading.	2000-07-17

What makes Dubliners so amenable to an annotated edition is that it is essentially an immediately accessible work of fiction - Joyce's only (the Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man being slightly trickier). Why are annotations so crucial to this work? The multiple place and character references make up a significant portion of these stories: Without a knowledge of the settings you're left with the virtuoso, stand-alone, psychological complexities of Joyce's style.<br /><br />If you like Joyce's fiction (or are new to Joyce's fiction), this is a *fun* copy (and excellent introduction). These stories were written for, and read by, people who *did* understand the numerous contemporary Irish references as  well as the history and iconography of the Roman Catholic Church. My experience of Dubliners is that this is the only truly readable version. Enjoy these heartwarming yarns of a city's moral and psychological twilight: Paralysis, disillusionment, collapse.

Period.<br /><br />If you have despaired of learning not just the tricks, but also the trade, of calculus, this book will amaze you; you know alot more  than you thought, and are alot better at both differential and integral  calculus than you may even have hoped. I learned calculus to MY OWN satisfaction using this book. It is immaculately clear in presentation, and not only holds interest but also reader confidence, (very much in an a la Feynman sort of way). I have neither seen nor can even imagine a better primer. Points:<br /><br />1. The book omits all the rubbish about \\"proofs\\"; it obviously works, why bother? Only (sadistic?) mathematicians value such hieroglyphics. Strugglers DO NOT want to even SEE it;<br /><br />2. Numerous well-worked examples abound throughout, and all exercises  have answers in the back of the book. There are few things in this world  more irritating than a (sadistic?) mathematician who puts problems without solutions in a calculus primer;<br /><br />3. This book demystifies the terminolgy and techniques of what, at least in the rudimentary stages, is really not so difficult a topic. The presentation starts at ground zero, (slopes and  limits in plain talk), and concludes with a very clear chapter on multiple integrals.<br /><br />You will acquire a lot of familiarity with calculus, and lose a lot of pent-up dread. You will also be able to derive, from first principles at a moment's notice, the formula for the volume of a sphere -  much to the amazement of friends and family.<br /><br />In a former lifetime as a scientist, I couldn't help noticing how leery many of my peers would become when even the word \\"calculus\\" was mentioned. To these, calculus was a dreaded schoolmaster, ready to slap their palms with a pandybat. To me, it was an old and much appreciated friend - a lot more clever and eccentric than (even) me, but generally understandable, if you take the time to bear with him.<br /><br />If you need or want to understand  basic calculus, the buck stops here. \\"Do yourself a favor.\\"nt to understand  basic calculus, the buck stops here. \\"Do yourself a favor.\\"	2000-07-12

But that is all and that is the disappointment. Though the book tries, it reads like an uninspired graduate thesis. The basics are touched but there's too much left unaddressed. The author's conventional treatment of alchemy reminds me of Jowett's handling of Plato's Timaeus - uninspired. Specific issues: A thorough recital of the tenets and symbols of  alchemy, and a rigorous tabular account of their correspondences with  Wakean themes is lacking. Also, a tying-in of the luminaries of alchemy and their cameo appearances throughout the Wake might have been attempted.<br /><br />Two stars for being the only currently available discussion of alchemical motifs in Finnegans Wake.	2000-07-11

It has everything we expect in a work by Campbell: Scholarship, profundity, and mirth. A \\"weakness\\" of the book is its overly academic style, characteristic of Campbell's early career before he had made a name for himself. On the other hand, the book is well-crafted, satisfying, and never drags.<br /><br />Campbell teaches that heroes evolve as cultures evolve. Heroes depart for adventure, willingly or  unwillingly, summoned or unsummoned. Often there are messengers sent to arouse the heroes (the old milkwoman in Joyce's Ulysses, Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings, Athene in Homer's Odyssey,  Phillipe in Disney's Beauty and the  Beast, the White Rabbit in Alice's Adventures, Obi-Wan in Lucas' Star Wars, etc). Then, there is a barrier of guardians between the everyday world whose knowledges and perceptions the  hero has assimilated, and the foreign world of unknown  adventures. Successful passage gives entree to the mythic realm of \\"the Soul's high adventure\\". Perhaps there will be a \\"descent into the dark\\" in which the hero is cut to pieces (to be  later resurrected); otherwise he will emerge transformed and renewed. Then, completing his quest, the hero returns to guide and help others.<br /><br />A definite must-read for anyone interested in mythic heroic themes, the book's signal strength is it blurs the mind's eye to the distinctions between mythology, religion, and  philosophy. And this is perhaps the main thrust of Campbell's work - to create compassion for all the spiritual traditions of mankind. This compassionate insight Campbell calls Ariadne's thread, which permits us to escape from the chthonic, claustrophobic labyrinth of dead men's thoughts and traditions to emerge breathing clean, cold, divine mountain air. Whether or not you approve of this approach, it is useful to be aware of and certainly fosters tolerance. That said, in terms of theology, it reeks: Campbell will tell you straight to your face God never spoke to anyone.<br /><br />Bad theology aside, Campbell's work is wonderful and a great gift to us all, providing an understanding of the common mythic inheritance we all share.ce God never spoke to anyone.<br /><br />Bad theology aside, Campbell's work is wonderful and a great gift to us all, providing an understanding of the common mythic inheritance we all share.	2000-06-27

My copy was a first edition hardcover - a lovely book to hold and touch.<br /><br />To my thinking, this book is THE first (and perhaps final) reference for those interested in beginning to explore the depths and subtleties of the Hindu tradition. I have never found a more accessible and enjoyable introduction to the broad topic of Indian Spirituality.<br /><br />The history of Hindu religious development, and the import of its symbols, are nicely embellished throughout with the relevant Sanskrit terminology, which adds a considerable pleasure in the course of the read - especially when Zimmer describes the rich philosophical texture of these terms. One is immediately reminded of the difficult translational passage on leaving the psychologically rich Greek language for our practical, utilitarian English. Zimmer nicely bridges this gap. Further, the reader is never at a loss to follow the scholarly exposition of ideas.<br /><br />The presentation nicely dovetails with Campbell's own work in comparative religion and mythology, and for anyone that appreciates his clarity and articulate manner of presentation, or has unhappily fallen back from unsuccessful attempts to appreciate the broad outlines and import of the philosophies of India, this book is simply a gem. My only proviso is that the book does become mildly tedious toward the middle, as historical minutiae begin to proliferate. Nevertheless, if this topic interests you, be sure to consult Philosophies of India first; it is most certainly an excellent primer.	2000-06-22

I had the wonderful experience of hearing him lecture at his Philosophical Research Society in Los Angeles shortly before his passing in 1990. Having read classical and comparative philosophy and religion for many years, my impression - shared by my betters and many scholars - is you really cannot do better than this book. There are many editions available, even a paperback edition currently in many bookstores.<br /><br />If you appreciate Joseph Campbell but wish to pursue the more mystical side of religion, Manly P Hall is an excellent resource. Whereas Campbell was a self-proclaimed \\"maverick\\" with no particular allegiance to any one form of religion, Manly P Hall was a thirty-third degree Freemason, and clearly sympathetic to the theory that in our ancient past there existed a system of mystery religions in which invocation of deities and angels was practiced and actually achieved. (Classic example, if memory serves, being Plutarch's tale of the invocation of the Neoplatonist Plotinus' guardian angel in the Temple of Isis in Rome by an Egyptian priest.) Hall breaks ranks with Christianity's declaring such entities to have been demons, and views them instead as our good buddies in the spiritual neighborhood. That said, to Hall's credit, he never minimizes the great perils of seeking gratuitous spiritual experiences.<br /><br />If you are sympathetic to \\"the old religions\\" and want a sympathetic scholarly accounting, it is hard to imagine how you could do better than purchasing and studying this book. If you are someone who believes in the Bible as the inspired word of God, you will have to come to your own conclusion whether Hall is worth your time, as he inevitably delivers a philosophical interpretation of the Bible.<br /><br />Those seeking a deeper prayer life, consult [[ASIN:0895551780 The Ways of Mental Prayer]].

The objectivity may be lacking, therefore, in this assessment - freely admitted, and accept my apologies.<br /><br />Campbell spent ~4 years, if memory serves, on this book. He said he finally had to get away from the Wake because everything he read started to sound as though it was from the Wake.<br /><br />Having been an avid reader of Joyce for many years, Campbell's Key is to my mind THE definitive work on the Wake. Anyone can criticize another's work, and perhaps it is unreasonable to expect a critic to be as brilliant as the victim of his wiseacreing, but to my mind criticisms of this beautiful and inspired work are rather worthless.<br /><br />The Key is always my primary reference for the Wake. Annotations (Roland McHugh) is just a phone book of references; the Key is first-rate scholarship. Infallibility is not a requirement for brilliance, assuming there is merit to criticism of this work.<br /><br />But as Joseph Campbell would say, don't buy a book because it is said to be important; buy it because it \\"catches\\" you.

He lucidly explicates Joyce's theory of art (alone worth the price of the tapes), relates the texts' themes to mythology and philosophy, and generally provides a wonderful sense of James Joyce as a brilliant man of sorrows acquainted with grief, who labored mightily to bring forth the Big Three. Perhaps even on a level with Stuart Gilbert's [[ASIN:0394700139 James Joyce's Ulysses]].<br /><br />As usual Campbell can't resist taking one or two cheap shots at Christianity, as he was a flaming Modernist, but if you're willing to overlook that then these tapes are a great buy for anyone interested in Joyce.	1998-05-09

The memorable observation by the Roman Emperor Julian is that the Christians were often very good people but they were usually terribly ignorant: Theirs was not a virtue in the grand Pythagorean or Platonic-Neoplatonic style. They had amazingly simplistic and crude ideas. Yet despite that, many Christians faithfully and successfully adhered to extremely high standards of personal morality. And they attained such moral heights despite the fact that the Christians often came from the absolute lowest and most disreputable strata of society, whereas in the pagan mysteries (according to Plutarch, Plato, and Julian) only those who were pure of heart and character were permitted to enter.<br /><br />Christians will recall Julian was the Roman emperor who was determined to disprove Christianity by rebuilding the destroyed Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem. If you haven't heard that story yet, and how all his efforts to do so came to naught, it's worth looking up online and reading.<br /><br />A good reference but - (curiously) - not a Taylor translation that holds interest on subsequent rereading.	1998-04-14

Does he succeed? I would say no. This book is well written, has many examples of successful couples therapy, and its humanistic spirit is clear. For example, he points out to a couple that their having marital problems is not a failure but an inevitability of being married. The key question is how such difficulties are understood and faced. A trait of Schnarch's approach is his synthesis of sex and marriage therapies, and his critique is that Modernist pop culture has left the majority lacking in character and resilience when it comes to monogamy. I could not agree more. Indeed this Western trend has been commented on since the time of Karl Marx. But again, why is that?<br /><br />Since I'm Roman Catholic, the book's difficulty for me is its ignoring Biblical teaching on the proper relationship between husbands and wives. If you are a devout follower of Christ, you probably will find this book a resolute gymnastic in futility. Basically, the book embraces the Modernist/Marxist idea of marriage being two people who have rejected God's way of doing things \\"working it out\\" on their own by routinely paying a couples therapist to help them when they find nothing they do works after their initial decision to ignore God. If playing spiritual Russian roulette and dancing on the side of Vesuvius are your cup of tea, you're gonna like this book big time.<br /><br />Overall, Passionate Marriage *tries* to bring married readers back to reality and realistic expectations, providing a blueprint on how to build and maintain an intimate, happy, meaningful human relationship of quality and depth in a shallow age. That's good. But what about Dr. Schnarch's accurate critique of modern culture mentioned above? How can you make a mature person out of a perennial child? Well, you can't. But that doesn't stop Dr. Schnarch sending couples to the therapist or buying his book. The good doctor cannot cure the disease with the pharmacopoeia he has on hand. And that's it, friends. This isn't so much marriage therapy as couples therapy. *Unnecessary* couples therapy.

Anna discovers that your entire psyche unravels. Anna's moral may be we cannot ignore our inner need to exist in a society in which we are a meaningful member. The story's moral also might be to avoid letting the past poison the present.<br /><br />Anna Karenina is an example of what in Japan is referred to as the giri-ninjo conflict - the clash of personal feeling against duty. In many old Japanese stories, the respectable family man finds himself in passionate love with a geisha and, unable to obtain society's acceptance, he and his lover commit suicide together. Anna and her lover Vronsky implode emotionally over time, their love unravels, and when you love someone that itself is a form of suicide.<br /><br />The Constance Garnett translation is best; she knew Tolstoy and he personally approved of her translation. A tremendously beautiful tempest of a book filled with memorable scenes and profound explorations of the human condition.	1998-02-06

Wood attempts to prove that certain Greek myths were, at least on one level, deliberately coded information regarding the origin of mankind. Wood supports his argument by the geometrical patterns created - presumably intentionally - by the placement in France of ancient sites devoted to religious cults. His claim that phallectomy was an intrinsic part of certain ancient religious initiation rites seems farfetched, but nonetheless the book is a highly stimulating and most unusual presentation of the ancient high science genre.	1998-01-23
