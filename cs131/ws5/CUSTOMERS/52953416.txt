They are the masters of stories that grip you and keep you turning the pages, but finally depress you about the state of the world and its unanswerable dilemmas.<br /><br />Gone, Baby, Gone fits right into this category.  The book has a deep and twisting plot that keeps you guessing to the very end.  Lehane is great a depressing you and then relieving the pressure in smooth alternation.<br /><br />The characters are well drawn and interesting.  The righting is tight and smooth, and the plotting is excellent.<br /><br />This book is NOT for the faint-of-heart (or stomach) or young.  I would not recommend it to a young teenager and certainly not to a pre-teen.	2005-07-30

However, like most of Parker's later writing, this book lacked the sense of danger one would hope to get from a crime drama.  Burke (the main character) simply (and I do mean \\"simply\\") kills anyone who threatens him and then the book is over.  This is similar to most of the later Spenser books, but without the sparkling, funny dialog of a Spenser book.<br /><br />I enjoyed the portrayal of Jackie Robinson, the baseball details, and the insertion of the old style box scores.  Parker's prose is, as usual, tight, clear and crisp.  But, like his character Burke, the book seems emotionally distant.<br /><br />Sitting on a beach and want to breeze through something fun?  This is your book.	2005-07-15

Both set you up with the question \\"How will this turn out?\\" and then bring you along with snappy, enjoyable prose, and show you the answer.<br /><br />Freakonomics does this masterfully.  It presents you with a question, \\"How can you tell if a cheating teacher is changing students' answers on standardized tests?\\" and \\"What level of proof would you need to fire a teacher based on the word of an economist?\\".<br /><br />These questions are the energy that drove me through the book.  I couldn't put it down until I had learned how they did it.  And, just as I had figured out that question, the book would launch another one -- \\"Do sumo wrestlers cheat?

While we all realize that we make many snap decisions, Gladwell looks beneath this simple fact to uncover how we make these decisions and when we make them poorly.<br /><br />He discusses four primary mechanisms:<br /><br />1.  Our ability to recognize a signature that pervades a person's behavior or an object's coherence.<br /><br />2.  Our ability to strip away unimportant information to make snap decisions -- or conversely to be confused by too much information.<br /><br />3.  Our inability to make clear decisions when confronted with our built in prejudices.<br /><br />4.  Our inability to make clear decisions when forced to make decisions too quickly in unfamiliar situations.<br /><br />Gladwell uses stories about real people to illustrate all these behaviors and thus gives us the ability to recognize new situations where our ability to make \\"Blink\\" decisions may be helpful or compromised.<br /><br />The stories themselves are also fascinating, for example there is a professor who can analyze 15 minutes of conversation between a couple and predict, with 90% accuracy, whether they will be divorced in 15 years.  Blink explains how he does this in clear and entertaining language.  A great read.	2005-07-12

The Christian Science Monitor (June 27, 2005) reports:<br /><br />\\"She was punished for no crime of her own. A rival clan went to the punchayat claiming that Mai's teenaged brother allegedly had a sexual relationship with a girl of their clan. Villagers say the boy was merely seen walking with the girl. The punchayat ordered that Mai be raped by the rival clan members to settle the score.\\"<br /><br />This is Daniel Quinn's \\"Erratic Retaliator\\" strategy in action. Quinn says that this strategy, \\"Give as good as you get. Don't be too predictable.\\" has evolved as the only workable strategy for groups of humans to settle their differences.<br /><br />Quinn claims that living this way makes people happier than they could ever be under laws that outlaw rape or adultery.  He says that tribal customs like the one that resulted in Mai's rape were simply there to put things back to right after an infraction and that they resulted in happier people and communities.  But, he ignores cases like Mai's.<br /><br />He also ignores the fact that the Israeli's and Palestinians are constantly engaged in an \\"Erratic Retaliator\\" strategy. They each give as good as they get and are not too predictable.  Apparently Quinn would argue that this works and that they are happy with the situation.<br /><br />One has to ask why Quinn chose to have Ishmael teach a 12-year old girl rather than another adult.  I think it's because his arguments in this book are too tenuous to survive an encounter with a thinking adult.<br /><br />For example, Quinn argues that Taker societies (generally agricultural societies with a notion of property) are inevitably doomed.  But he ignores success stories like the people of central New Guinea who created an agricultural society that lasted for 3000 years and maintained a sense of property.  He ignores success stories like Japan where the fact that there was a ruling class and a sense of ownership saved the island from ruin (those interested in learning more should read \\"Collapse\\" by Jared Diamond.)<br /><br />Even Quinn's argument about the beauty of the Erratic Retaliator strategy is flawed.  The people of Easter Island maintained both an Erratic Retaliator strategy and agriculture.  They destroyed themselves competing over who could make the biggest head.<br /><br />Quinn also misses the fact that Nations today already use the Erratic Retaliator.  After 9/11 the USA deposed the Taliban (give as good as you get ... or a little better) and then attacked Iraq (but don't be too predictable.)  Would he argue that this is the way we want to conduct international affairs?<br /><br />Towards the end of the book Quinn spends time telling us that we should not judge gangs and cults harshly.  After all, they are simply following the strategies that humans evolved over millions of years.  He forgets, of course, that having a gang engaging in the \\"Don't be too predictable\\" part of the strategy in your backyard is bad news.<br /><br />He even glosses over Jonestown and claims that people would rather die than give up this way of life.  He never thought to mention that many of the people in Jonestown were forced to drink at the point of a gun.<br /><br />Ishmael goes on another riff in book on how the public school systems were only created to keep students out of the job market and too stupid to take high paying positions from older people.  Barring the idiocy of ascribing a motive like this to our public school dilemma, Quinn forgets that we need our students to be more productive than us if we want Social Security to keep working.  We don't benefit from making them stupid.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the original \\"Ishmael\\" book I found that I could barely get through this one.  I found the ideas in the original book refreshing.  They captured a basic truth that humans do tend to destroy all competitors.  Given that, I was saddened to see how sloppy Quinn's reasoning was in \\"My Ishmael\\".  I was also unhappy to see the pupil as such a maliable character.<br /><br />Through all Ishmael's one-sided diatribes, the poor 12-year old Julie says things like \\"Yes. That's true\\" and \\"True.  True.\\"  But, of course, being only 12-years old she doesn't have the wherewithal to fight back intellectually against the gorilla.  As a result, Ishmael gets away with a lot of sloppy scholarship and poor reasoning in his quest to save the world for Man and Gorilla.to destroy all competitors.

This is unusual for me and points to Seth Godin's approachable and entertaining writing style.<br /><br />The book highlights a provocative aspect of marketing that is generally overlooked. Namely that people buy products because of the way the products make them feel rather than based on an objective examination of the product features and that we, as marketers, need to respect that fact and use it.<br /><br />The \\"lies\\" in all marketers are Liars are really stories.  For example, there is the lie that a $3 cup of coffee from Starbucks is really dramatically better than the same cup of coffee sold at Dunkin Donuts.<br /><br />I think it would be tough to prove, in a double-blind study, that most people could really tell the difference between the coffees.  In fact, if you simply swapped the cups you'd probably find the Starbucks people would prefer the Dunkin Donuts coffee.<br /><br />We sit in Starbucks and drink the coffee because of the story we tell ourselves about what it means to be sitting in a Starbucks -- that we are sophisticated and urbane people with discerning taste.<br /><br />There are Dunkin Donuts drinkers who avoid Starbucks for that very reason.  Their story is that they are hard-working regular folks who don't go in for all that baloney.<br /><br />Both stories are lies.  The coffee doesn't really make you urbane or hard-working, but they are lies that we tell ourselves and they help us identify who we are -- so they are benign.<br /><br />Godin shows us how to disect stories like these and create them for our own products.  He does it in an easy-to-follow and fun way and that makes for a great book and a fun read.	2005-06-12

Wright shows that we have shown a historical talent for self-destruction and that today's global civilization may be our last hurrah on the civilization train.<br /><br />Previous civilizations that have outstripped their natural resources have collapsed, but there has always been a new civilization elsewhere to pick up the pieces.  But, now that we have a global civilization a collapse would take down the whole world.<br /><br />While I think this is an excellent book, and worth the five stars, it does miss on one point.  There are no suggestions or prescriptions for how to address the problem.  It seems that the problem Wright describes is created by the same forces that drive Adam Smith's invisible hand -- the quest of individuals to improve their position.  While this individualism can drive economies to grow, Wright would argue that it can also drive civilizations to outstrip their resources -- \\"Surely MY SUV is not going to bring down civilization.  Let someone else drive the Hybrid.\\"<br /><br />How do we change this behavior? The book does not have suggestions.<br /><br />It is critical that the ideas on this book become part of the political debate in the world.  If we continue to blindly ignore history's warnings, we are likely to see a collapse that would cut our 6-Billion population in half, or even lower.	2005-04-25

The book is overly complicated and provides levels of detail in its examples that are unnecessary to make the point or teach the subject.<br /><br />For example, when discussing ports the book says the following:<br /><br />DEFINITION: A SystemC interface is an abstract class that inherits from sc_interface and provides only pure virtual declarations of methods referenced by SystemC channels and ports.  No implements or data are provided in a SystemC interface.<br /><br />DEFINITION: A SystemC channel is a class that implements one or more SystemC interface classes and inherits from either sc_channel or sc_prim_channel.  A channel implements all the methods of the inherited interface classes.<br /><br />DEFINITION: A SystemC port is a class templated with and inheriting from a SystemC interface.  Ports allow access of channels across module  boundaries.<br /><br />Huh?<br /><br />This line of teaching led me into the bowels of SystemC and was unnecessary as a start.  One can just say, \\"A port allows communication between blocks.  Let's look at sc_in and sc_out to start\\".<br /><br />I needed to get another book to recover from this instruction.<br /><br />The examples in the book are generally OK and there is a website that has executable versions.  Unfortunately, there needed to be more careful editing in the examples.  The HelloWorld example has an obvious syntax error (an undeclared module is instantiated) and would never have run if it had been compiled.<br /><br />I could not find the video mixer example that they used to teach ports on the web, and thus couldn't make progress.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good book if you know SystemC and are interested in the details of how it is implemented.  I would use it to learn the language, and it cannot act as a language reference guide.	2005-03-28

It's quirky, graphically oriented style makes it readable and brings you the information from several different angles.  It uses the latest ideas in learning (coupling information with play) to cement the concepts in reader's mind.<br /><br />The use of graphics is excellent.  For example, a disussion of objects might include an Animal class that is extended to a dog, cat, and hippo class.  Most books would discuss this analogy textually.  This book has a family tree of the objects with photographs of each kind of animal.  The picture brings home the idea.<br /><br />The book's other strength is that it talks about objects first.  In the old days (80's, 90's) we mostly learned languages by learning how to write statements in the language.  The helloworld program is an example of this kind of teaching.  Objects were considered an advanced topic.<br /><br />In a strongly object-oriented language like Java, it makes more sense to learn about objects first, as the basic unit of programming, and build from there.<br /><br />The book is not a reference book, and if you are looking for how to use a specific class or do a specific task you'd be better off with a different book.  But, if you are just getting started with Java, this is a great start!	2005-03-21

Unfortunately it is light on examples, runs out of steam, and is weakly written.<br /><br />Great books like this follow a pattern of make-a-point/tell-a-story.  The book makes many points, but it does them in a rapid fire fashion and never gives examples or stories that bring it home to the reader.  What results is a list of ideas without a picture of how they hang together.<br /><br />The book offers a six week program, but the authors ran out of steam on week 5 and week 5 and 6 are only one page each.<br /><br />The writing is weak.  Here is a typical passage, \\"Unfortunately, sometimes once you are part of an organization, you begin to come across skeletons in their closet.\\"  The equivocation sucks all the life out of this sentence.<br /><br />This unwillingness to make a strong statement is helpful in face-to-face conversations but makes for dreadful reading.  The sentence should have read, \\"All organizations have skeletons in their closets and it's only a matter of time until you find them in your new organization.\\"<br /><br />The book also needs more copy editing.  For example, the author is an alumni of my school, the Univeristy of Massachusetts at Amherst (not Amhurst.)

For example, The One Minute Manager Meets the Monkey is a classic of proper delegation.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Last Minute Manager was not up to the usual standards of this series.  The book was not compelling and did not really teach the reader a solution to the problem of procrastination.<br /><br />* The basic problem was that the book did not have a simple system to teach.  Though the system was called The Three P's these were really headings for a complex variety of questions, ideas and principles that made the execution process more complex than it needed to be.  The fact that the third \\"P\\" started with C was a bit jarring.  The book claimed this was a mnemonic device but I see it more as an symptom of the fact that the whole model needed more work.<br /><br />* The main character is a doofus.  I didn't find myself cheering for his success, I simply found myself annoyed with him.  The descriptions of him as \\"Bob the last-minute Manger\\", \\"Bob the suddenly-surprised Manager\\", \\"Bob the newly-focused Manager\\" etc were also annoying.<br /><br />* The book had too much theory and not enough tactics. It presented you with high levels questions and ideas about your priorities but it was light on examples of how to use them.  For example it shows you a \\"triage\\" form but we never see Bob use it.<br /><br />* There were no examples of how Bob the-highly-annoying Manager used his new found skills to improve his work or productivity.  The book did not clearly tie the process in the book to the problem of lateness, poor-quality, and stress.<br /><br />There is definitely room for a Blanchard book on the problem of time management.  I'm afraid that I can't recommend this one.  Instead I recommend \\"First Things First\\" by Steven Covey for those struggling with this issue.  It is much more work to read, but I think it solves the problems that afflict Bob in this story in a more straightforward manner.<br /><br />Finally there is a pet peeve.  Why do all these management book use married men as examples of people who need to be fixed?  I agree that the problem of choosing a sex for someone with a problem is vexing, and its most likely that married men will be the least likely to complain.

I had looked forward to reading this book due to the authors previous book \\"Execution\\".  That book had solid, detailed information on how to create the kinds of processes you need to build a strong business.  I still pull it down for a refresher on strategic plans. Unfortunately, Confronting Reality came nowhere close to being as useful.<br /><br />Most of this book reads like a high school report where the student was told to fill a certain number of pages and writes fluff to do it.  It repeats itself by using various ways to say the same thing ... It's important to face reality in today's world ... The importance of facing reality in today's world cannot be overstated ... Reality, which is important in today's world, must be faced.<br /><br />The book has some interesting ideas and examples, but they are hidden among repetitive cliches and a weak writing style.  This book needed a strong editor -- but then it would have been 50% shorter.<br /><br />Bossidy and Charan share a concept they call \\"The Business Model\\".  This turned out to simply be the idea that you need to align external realities and internal capabilities with your financial business goals.  This is Business Planning 101 and it adds little value to an executive business reader.<br /><br />Of course, if everyone understands the idea of this model why do so many companies seem to ignore it?  Bossidy and Charan name several factors that keep companies from creating realistic business models, but they don't discuss the knobs you turn and bells you clang to get an organization to change.  Simply saying, \\"You must understand your customer\\" is not the same as describing a reward system that creates this ethic in a company.<br /><br />They do discuss one powerful CEO tool -- the initiative (Six Sigma, ERP, etc.)  This is the first book I've read that showed how a CEO could use the initiative as an organizational growth tool.  I wish that they had gone into more detail on this topic and given several examples of success and failure.<br /><br />I felt that the authors had been told that they should write a sequel, so they did a quick job of it.  They visited their GE alum buddies, wrote a few business cases, and used the \\"Business Model\\" concept to hold them together.  But there is no passion in this book.<br /><br />The book seems ill-researched.  For example, it talks about how Dell used its realistic business model to defeat Apple Computer.  Defeat Apple?  This book was written in 2003.  The authors should have known better than to use this example.  Steve Jobs had already done one of the best jobs in history of bringing reality into a severely dysfunctional organization and turning it around.  I would have loved a detailed analysis of how he did this.  Was he a micromanager?  Did he need to fire many people?  How hard was it to decide to kill the Newton?  What things did he do that related to the book Execution?  Now THAT would have been a great book.<br /><br />To be fair, Charan and Bossidy had interesting case discussions on 3M and Home Depot.  They touched upon the question of how you recognize the deficiencies in an organization and bring it to the next level.  But again, the details were missing.<br /><br />In the end, I walked away feeling that Bossidy and Charan didn't take their own advice in publishing this book.  I don't think they understood the needs of their customers (executives, not publishers), and I don't they faced the reality of what they were publishing.

The other thing you'll need to enjoy is sentence construction that goes, &quot;You would think that it is A but it is really B.&quot;<br />After reading this stuff for a few pages, I asked, who edited this thing?  And then I found that Wolfram himself had published it. (Hint to Wolfram -- when you self publish a book don't name the publishing company after yourself.)  And this revealed the book for what it was.  A self-aggrandizing collection of Wolfram's experiements with computers.<br />Given that knowlege, I plunged ahead hoping for some insights on self-organizing system, evolution, or any of the other areas Wolfram claimed to have revolutionized.  Sadly there was nothing useful.<br />Wolfram didn't seem to realize that much of his work had already been discovered in other fields.  He was unable to make meaningful links to the real world and his insufferable egotism finally wore me out.<br />Thanks goodness I didn't pay for it.  I received it as a gift from a dear friend who saw it on my wish list, but am not willing to pay for the shelf space to keep it.	2003-11-01

As the others have pointed out, this book is an EXCELLENT training manual and a great starter guide.<br />I also found that the comic book style made this book extremely accessable.  People who might be intimidated by a 200-300 page book (and there are more than you'd think) will be willing to read this book because its essentially a large comic book.<br />But don't let the format fool you.  The information density is very high and this is a book that belongs in everyone's library as a reference.<br />I also liked the emphasis on doing this business TOGETHER as a team.  That's missing in a lot of books.	2002-11-22

I was able to use the framework in this book immediately.<br />As a result of reading the book, I told my employee that I would be using a new system for coaching and I asked my employee what he wanted to work on and what I should watch for.  This gave me a framework for my observations.<br />I also used the system they recommended to separate what I saw from my inferences.<br />The resulting discussion was useful for both of us.  I was able to say things like &quot;I saw that the audience was leaning forward and nodding.  I took that to mean they were attentive.  There was one woman who was leaning back and sort of looking around.  I took that to mean she was bored.&quot;  then the employee said that she had seen the presentation before.<br />I asked for his feedback at the end about my new coaching approach and he was very enthusiastic!<br />Excellent system!	2002-10-24

I had started strong again in my new network marketing business, but had slowed down and saw my business dying.<br />The problem was that I would be overcome with shallow breath, a foggy mind, and churning stomach when I had to call people I knew but didn't know well.<br />The book allowed me to diagonose my problem as Role Rejection.  I was afraid that I would disappoint people when they learned I was in a network marketing company, and I was physically feeling that fear every time I tried to make calls.  I was able to bull my way through, but it was exhausting.<br />After reading the book and using the exercises I recognized that I was worrying to much about what other people thought of me.  I used two of the techniques in the book to calm my nerves and remove the fear.<br />My business is taking off again!<br />It is rare to find a book that so obviously saved a career, but this is one.	2002-10-24

Needs Editing	This book deals with paradigm shifts and how they changed the way we have looked at the world.  Burke takes a subject like &quot;Perspective Drawing&quot; and shows how it changed the world fo science and architecture by providing a basis for measuring.<br />The last chapter of the book is the best and should probably be read first.  In this chapter Burke summarizes the changes in science that have happened over the past 2500 years and how the paradigms control what scientists see and study.  (Interestingly enough he never uses the word &quot;paradigm&quot; but refers to the lens through which we view the world as a &quot;structure.&quot;)<br />Unfortunatly, the book lacks the editing that would have made it a great book.  Burke is too wordy, and will use three paragraphs to discuss a point that was adequately covered in the first one.  This lack of concise writing dilutes the impact of Burke's ideas so that it is hard to pick out the significance of the events.<br />Burke also will spend great amounts of time on the buildup to a world changing idea, but then short change the big event.  For example, he discusses the various views and discussions that led up to Issac Newton's work, but then simply says in a single paragraph that Newton's work was so dramatic that it stopped scientific progress for 100 years.  I'd like to dig into that!<br />I recommend this book despite its flaws.  Understanding how we reached science's position today shows that there were other ways of looking at the world that we cut off along the way.	2002-08-18

I eat fruits, vegetables, whole wheat bread, and low carb snack foods.  My weight has been Rock Solid -- I am sold on doing Atkins.<br /><br />This book is a good addition to your Atkins collection, but you should NOT read it as an introduction to the diet.  Read \\"Dr. Atkins New Diet Revolution\\" for that.  This book focuses on vitamins and minerals and how they affect the aging process.  As a result of this book I know what anti-oxidents are and why they are important, I understand the ingredients on vitamin bottles, and I am even MORE against eating sugar than I was before.<br /><br />This is a good book and I recommend it to anyone interested in general nutrition.	2002-08-06

It also reminded me of my adolescent years and helped me make sense of what happened back then.<br />However, the book didn't square completely when I compared it to the reality of my friend's children.  Yes, they do have problems with teasing, etc.  But they are not constantly in the depressing, &quot;lose yourself of be ostracized&quot; dilemma that Pipher describes.<br />I think that she is describing the world that she saw when constantly being exposed to troubled girls.  But while the themes are correct, I wonder if the intensity is true for most girls.	2002-05-26

There were far too many plot twists.  The book seemed to lurch spasmodicaly through the mystery.<br />Deleware's relationships were relatively flat and his relationship with Robin had no depth or feeling.  This was my first Alex Delaware book and I found I really didn't care what happened to any of the characters.<br />I think it's interesting that the used versions are being sold for a penny.

It teaches the basic endgames and moves quickly from problem to problem.<br />My only problem with the book is that it is a little incomplete.  For example, when it showed how to checkmate with a knight and bishop it assumed that the opponent would make the best possible move at every step.<br />Sometimes the opponent could make a weaker move, but if you don't know how to exploit it he will escape.

In my 15 years in high tech, I've seen many established companies being done in by smaller competitors.  While this is going all we would all shake our heads at the stupidity of the management of the large companies ... couldn't they see the trends?<br />This book gives the first lucid explanation of why this happens.  It shows that the managers were not being stupid.  On the contrary, they were doing exactly what their customers wanted them to do ... and what they could afford to do.<br />This book also lays out an excellent foundation that allows you to recognize the pattern and accurately predict where it could happen again.<br />Great work!	2001-07-25

Fashion and Movies are two examples where the name &quot;Aramani&quot; or &quot;Julia Roberts&quot; will make a product or  company a success.<br />In the &quot;New New Thing&quot; Lewis shows that this  process has happened in the buying and selling of High Tech companies (if  not their products) and he shows how Jim Clark got rich based upon his  reputation.<br />The book gives a good and fairly candid view of Clark.  I  felt that Lewis kept his distance from the subject and avoided being swept  up in the hype of Clark driven companys.  Lewis's writing is fresh and  enjoyable.  The stories about how High Tech companies get started and how  VC's and engineers work together to create companies were interesting and  informative.<br />Lewis focuses entirely on Clark, so it is difficult to tell  if Clark's ability to make money based on his name is limited to him, or if  there are others who are achieving the Rock Star status he has.<br />Overall  well worth reading.	2000-02-10

The solution to the mystery was unrealistic and there really was no way to see it coming.<br />In addition the characters acted very strangely,  especially Cuddy's girlfriend.  The main character himself had very little  personality and the book just kind of moved along to its end.<br />There were  lot's of Red Herring and interesting angles to the problem, but in the end  I felt that the author had pulled a fast one.	2000-01-29

It wants to get you from W95 to Linux on your PC and show you that you can get the same functionality you are used to on a PC in Linux.<br />It succeeds in that narrow scope.  I am  typing this from my newly running Linux system.  However, this book is not  enough to really get you running smoothly.<br />Linux is still not ready for  the average user -- though the book would argue otherwise.  There are  enough gotchas to take you out of the narrow path of the book pretty  quickly, and then you will need other resources.  In my case, I need to  learn how to get my sound card working and my Zip drive running, and the  PPP dialer working.  The paths suggested in the book didn't  work.<br />Fortunately, the author points you to other resources on the web so  you can continue your search.<br />The book comes with a copy of Red Hat 6.0.  So it gives you everything you need to  get started.  However, I would also buy a reference type book as well.	1999-09-15

For example, there is one chapter  that discusses the size of organizations.

Waitzkin shows you about two games per chapter and asks you to figure out his next move based upon the theme of the chapter.

You won't walk away really knowing anything well.<br />Given that, the  book is kind of fun and light.  Waitzkin (either Josh or Fred) is a good  writer and the book is enjoyable.	1999-07-15

The ability to pick up the book and get good advice in a page or two is excellent.<br />The advice is sound and very specific.  For example, Fox suggests a specific way of handling a character assasin that turns the assasin's words  back onto himself or herself.<br />I often think of these specific pieces of advice when I'm deciding what to do next in my day or on a road trip.<br />Overall, an excellent guide!	1998-11-01

Competing for the Future will largely waste your time.  It is a 100 page book crammed into 300+ pages.  The authors spend lots of time repeating fuzzy feel good ideas, and criticizing current managers, but say little that would actually help you compete for the future.  They continually cite Apple as the poster child for Competing for the Future (ignoring the fact that the Mac was created in a skunkworks -- a concept they poo-poo.)  Yet you can see from Apple's plight today that Hamel and Prahalad have certainly not found the most important thing for long term success.  Companies that spend too much time looking 20 years out will never see it, as Apple will not.  The truth is that top management can certainly ask themselves &quot;What will competition mean in 20 years?&quot;, but they will most certainly be wrong.  We live in chaotic times, and the best companies know how to turn on a dime and exploit current emerging markets (Microsoft is great at this).  Hamel and Prahalad's books is destined to sit on many shelves, looking very impressive but doing nothing for its readers.	1998-05-31
