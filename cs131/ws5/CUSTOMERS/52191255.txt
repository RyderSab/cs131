This book is a useful reference book that reads like a heartfelt letter from a friend... A friend who has gone through a deep spiritual awakening.<br /><br />Some will find it too dry or too speculative.  Others will see it as a great starting point for further thought and research.<br /><br />This book can be fascinating reading if you enjoy innovative surveys of folklore and spirituality that is practically applied in the Llewellyn tradition.  It is especially thought-provoking if you are also involved in interior design and decor.<br /><br />Author Laurine Morrison Meyer began her research by asking, \\"Is there a Western equivalent to the Eastern practice of Feng Shui?\\" This began six years of research for this book.<br /><br />Ms. Meyer starts by discussing design principles that have always represented the home as well as the womb. She uncovers intriguing symbols of female reproductive anatomy in triangles and Vs, wavy lines, circles, ovals, and even the Greek Omega symbol.<br /><br />Next, Sacred Home explores early altars and home deities including Isis, Taweret, Hathor, Bess, Hestia, Bess, and many more. Meyer's discussion of ancestor worship and veneration in the home can be startling.<br /><br />This book is almost a whirlwind of diverse ideas, each more curious than the last.  However, her concepts also offer comfort and an innate ring of common sense.<br /><br />After discussing symbols of protection and decorating elements, Ms. Meyer provides an intriguing look at archetypal design styles. Sacred Home follows this with chapters on housewarming traditions, propitious principles, auspicious symbols, and the enchanted dwelling.<br /><br />This book is important for interior designers and decorators, as well as Feng Shui consultants. Sometimes, we too easily accept traditional Asian design elements. As designers, we should consider symbols from Western culture which could be more significant--and perhaps luckier--for Western homes.<br /><br />For example, in Feng Shui we often decorate the Fame area with red. Traditionally, this is the luckiest color when applying Feng Shui to areas relating to reputation as well as income. However, as Meyer notes, \\"Whereas red is considered a sign of good luck in China, in Western cultures red is often associated with prostitution, passion, and fast food eateries.\\" If those are your references as well, it would be a mistake to use red in your Fame area.<br /><br />When planning our homes and offices, it's important to include design elements that affect us deeply, profoundly, and sometimes subconsciously. However, unless we have Asian roots, a black Career area may seem depressing due to cultural connections between the color black and mourning. Green (for money) or gold might be better colors in the Career area of a Western home.<br /><br />Meyer's book is an excellent survey of alternatives to traditional Feng Shui elements. Sacred Home is a useful, thought-provoking tour of historical Western design concepts.<br /><br />This book introduces a wide range of beliefs and traditions throughout history. It's an ideal starting point for research into mythology's relationship to enduring decorating principles.<br /><br />Sacred Home is not heavily illustrated with design suggestions, but skips rapidly from one intriguing concept to the next.  Every one of Meyer's comments about home decor could provide enough ideas to fill a book.<br /><br />I recommend Sacred Home for design professionals, and anyone who is interested in the impact of Western folklore and spiritual traditions on design.  --reviewed by Aisling D'Art, former editor, BellaOnline: Feng Shuiple, in Feng Shui we often decorate the Fame area with red.

This is one of the very best books that I've seen for all levels of dollmakers, from beginners through professionals. Patti's new book is a real gem, and simplifies the process of creating unique faces for your cloth dolls and figures.<br /><br />When you're creating a doll, the face often makes the doll come alive. And, when I've taken or taught classes in dollmaking, faces seem to be the biggest hurdles for students.<br /><br />I won't say that Patti's approach is entirely \\"by the numbers,\\" but she has simplified the face designing process so that anyone can create a lovely, whimsical, sweet, or saucy doll face. Even better, Patti has included dolls made by a variety of artists and dollmakers, so that you can see many approaches to dolls and their faces. No two dolls will look alike, even if you follow the directions step-by-step... and that's how it should be.<br /><br />In the first chapter, after listing some basic supplies, Patti gets right to the design process, starting with a simple grid that's basic to any doll's face. Then, she shows how to draw the eye in eight simple steps, as well as an almost-foolproof approach to sketching a nose on a flat-faced doll. After demonstrating ways to create the mouth and add detailing to the face, Patti shows how to follow these same steps with colored pencils on fabric.<br /><br />Next, Patti shows you how to create a face with watercolors on fabric, and she offers inspiring examples for beginning, intermediate, and advanced dollmakers. Whether this is your first or your 50th doll, you'll appreciate her tips for making doll bodies, adding clothes, creating fabric flowers, and finishing the doll.<br /><br />In Chapter 3, Patti shows how to sculpt a head with fabric and very simple sewing techniques. And, after showing several ways to design a face for this kind of doll, she provides tips for creating hands, stockings & shoes, and ways to dress your doll. Again, she shows examples of soft-sculpted dolls for beginners, intermediates, and advanced dollmakers.  You'll be dazzled by the originality in these dolls!<br /><br />By Chapter 4, you'll be ready to explore more detailed painted faces, including acrylics and oil pastels, and Chapter 5 features innovative collage techniques for dollmakers.<br /><br />Finally, Patti has included a dozen pages of full-sized pattern pieces so that you can make some of the dolls which are featured in this fabulous, colorful book. And, she has included embroidery instructions, too.<br /><br />At the back of the book, you'll appreciate the Resources list of places to shop for dollmaking supplies, worldwide.<br /><br />If you're new to dollmaking or looking for fresh inspiration, this book is a must-read. I'm delighted with it, and eager to try some of Patti's techniques on my own cloth dolls and figures.<br /><br />Patti has finally made faces easier for all dollmakers, and this book is a fine starting point for fresh doll designs no matter what your skill level.<br /><br />This is one of the first dollmaking books that I can heartily recommend since Susanna Oroyan's excellent series. Get a copy for yourself, and one to give to someone who is learning to make cloth dolls and figures. This is a book to treasure!<br /><br />--reviewed by Aisling D'Art, founder and moderator, Wild Art Dollsners, intermediates, and advanced dollmakers.

In the years that followed, the market was flooded with books. Many of them were excellent, but even more were written to make money from what seemed like a fad. Even today, I still hold my breath when I see a new feng shui book.<br /><br />By contrast, \\"Feng Shui in Five Minutes\\" by Selena Summers is fun, innovative, and offers something different from the usual feng shui books.<br /><br />Ms. Summers works with \\"Dragon Door\\" feng shui, which shares much with Black Hat Sect feng shui. The bagua is determined by the entry door rather than the compass directions. However, like most well-written feng shui books, you can apply Ms. Summers' recommendations no matter how you orient the bagua (ba-gua or pa kua).<br /><br />Instead of starting with a dissertation on the elements, the corners, the bagua, and the cycles, Ms. Summers gets right to business. Her book is almost entirely questions and answers, and you can select any one that interests you and apply her advice in about five minutes.<br /><br />She also writes with refreshing wit and humor. For example, when discussing the power locations in any room, she advises, \\"If young children are already rebellious, don't let them watch TV late at night sitting in power seats. You may never get them to bed.\\" (This is in a chapter, \\"Good Feng Shui, Room by Room.\\")<br /><br />She keeps feng shui simple, which is great for beginners, but also a worthwhile refresher for professionals. I've been practicing feng shui for over ten years, and I'm delighted to be reminded of how much fun it is to find clever design solutions to challenging problems.<br /><br />Ms. Summers' chapter, \\"The Nine Celestial Cures\\" isn't the usual \\"stick a mirror on the wall to expand an area\\" advice. Instead, she talks about a wealth of solutions to feng shui dilemmas. From shiny ribbons to the merits of a grandfather clock, her advice is fresh, exciting, and wonderful. And, she keeps it all simple and fun.<br /><br />For beginners or for experienced feng shui consultants, this book is well worth owning.<br /><br />For example, Ms. Summers explains why it's better to eat upstairs in a split-level home, and which floor your apartment should be on, for the best luck. In fact, she often gives advice for people who rent and cannot paint or significantly change where they live. She has an entire chapter called \\"Transform Your Apartment's Energy.\\" That makes this book especially useful.<br /><br />Then there are the funky questions, such as what to do if you want a marriage proposal in the next 18 months. Her advice combines feng shui and positive thinking for delightful results.<br /><br />Ms. Summers also uses common sense. For most feng shui problems, she suggests two or three different solutions; one of them is sure to work in terms of your budget, design preferences, and location.<br /><br />Finally, Ms. Summers adds fun with a chapter about lucky charms that are suited to the year of your birth, and how to use those charms day and night. Is this serious? Only if you want it to be. Her information is accurate, and her tone is light. It's a good combination.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, no matter how much (or little) you know about feng shui, or which form of feng shui you're using. It's great reading, and offers innovative ideas that are quick and easy to apply.<br /><br />--Reviewed by Aisling D'Art, editor, Feng Shui at BellaOnline.comr advice is fresh, exciting, and wonderful.

However, turning this into an impressive color scheme often requires advice beyond standard feng shui books. \\"Annie Sloan's Color Schemes: For Every Room\\" is one of the very best if you want your surroundings to look as if you've hired a professional decorator.<br /><br />Let's say that you're working on your Fame and Reputation area, which is often what visitors see first when they enter your home or office. Red is recommended, but... then what?<br /><br />In Annie Sloane's lavishly illustrated book, you can start at the \\"Reds Plus\\" page and choose a color theme. For example, if you'd like a Pacific Islands look, start with Hibiscus Red--a slightly orange-ish red--and accent it with Gauguin Blue, a greyish medium blue.<br /><br />Next, turn to the Pacific Islands section of the book and see the many other colors that will work well with your basic red and blue \\"islands\\" theme. You may want to add Banana Leaf Green, Lagoon Blue, Guava Orange, or Mango Yellow.<br /><br />And, if these colors don't sound familiar, the book is filled with good, large swatches. You can take the book to the paint or home furnishings store to match the looks that you like.<br /><br />If you'd prefer an African Visions theme for your Fame area, Ms. Sloan suggests starting with Ghana Red and Clearwater Green. If your tastes are more traditional and favor antiques, choose the Neoclassical colors of Aubusson Pink and a lovely bamboo shade of brown called Sandstone.<br /><br />For your Money area, instead of overloading the corner with purples, choose an Elizabethan Pageant theme, and a muted Lavender Sachet shade, accented by a lovely pale Cambridge Blue. If you favor vivid colors reminiscent of fine art and the coast of France, Ms. Sloan offers an Impressionist palette. Or, Mambo Carnival colors may liven up an otherwise sedate or dark corner.<br /><br />What I like best about this book is that it helps me to break out of the \\"crayon box colors\\" approach to feng shui. I'm using this book when decorating, but also for innovative color combinations in my art and photography.<br /><br />If you're working with color for any reason, but especially with feng shui, I heartily recommend \\"Annie Sloan's Color Schemes: For Every Room.\\" --Aisling D'Art, Feng Shui editor, BellaOnlinereak out of the \\"crayon box colors\\" approach to feng shui.

He provides detailed explanations of the Underworld (and Otherworld) and the design of the realities you'll encounter there.  He relates this to the Tree of Life (Qabalah), and several other spiritual contexts, so that you can \\"connect the dots\\" with your own and others' religious backgrounds.<br /><br />Stewart's \\"Underworld Narrative\\" (guided meditation) in the back of the book is annotated with explanations and tips.  They're fascinating.  Reading them makes the journey far richer than simply using one of his excellent tapes.<br /><br />He's opinionated and well-researched.  Not everyone will agree with him, or even like him.  But, the information that he shares in this book is tremendously important if you plan to explore Otherworld realities.  If you're intrigued by the faerie realm, this book will save you years of frustration, trying to understand how to get there, how to remain there comfortably, understand what you're encountering, and how to get back.	2005-01-22

I refer to it often in my own studies, and rank it among the top three texts for Celtic spiritual history.	2005-01-18

Ms. Widmer gives her characters authentic \\"voices\\", and--even when I know how it'll turn out--this book is a real page-turner for me each time I read it.<br /><br />\\"Lace Curtain\\" is a painless way to learn the history of the Irish in New Orleans, while getting caught up in a great story.  In my opinion, this novel could stand alone as a history book, or as a romance novel.  Lucky for those of us who enjoy history and romance, this book shines in both categories.	2004-12-31

If you're looking to learn the newest techniques for transfering images to fabric, this isn't the book.  Jean Ray Laury offers more, as do other artist/authors.  But, this book was innovative 20 years ago, when I first read it and considered it a \\"must-own\\" five-star book.  And, there's a lot to be said for the creative energy in books like this. At the time, this book took enormous chances to bring new and innovative techniques to a fabric community where \\"fabric art\\" most often meant traditional pieced quilts in tasteful calicos.  It was a vitally important book in my development as an artist, and--if you're tracing the history of contemporary fabric art--I recommend this book.	2004-12-13

It's that extraordinarily good.  It contains twenty two different ways to get unstuck in terms of abundance, and allowing good things to come to you.<br /><br />I'm particularly happy with exercise #5, which reminds me of the movie, Brewster's Millions... so much that I went out and bought a copy of that movie and made up my own pretend checks and a check register.  I'm even creating an art journal of my adventures with this game.<br /><br />It seems to me that, if you're ready to allow true happiness and abundance into your life, there's a game in this book for everyone... no matter how challenging life is for you, right now.  Armed with this book and nothing else, perhaps not even hope, I expect that most people can change their lives significantly for the better.	2004-10-18

She says things with finality, and I don't always agree with her.  For example, I like to think that, someday, I WILL drive a Jaguar.  But, that said, when she talks about letting go of things that haven't worked in the past, and moving forward to a better future filled with achievable goals... this is a very good book for people who are depressed or otherwise feeling \\"stuck\\" in life.

It reminded me of Jayne Mansfield's giggly va-VOOM sense of style.  And, this made me go to my closet and look at all the sensible white blouses and Terribly Professional tailored clothing, and sigh deeply.<br />I went out and bought pink.  Pink blouses, pink undies, pink shoes.  Not what-a-cute-baby pink, but Bombshell Goddess PINK.<br />Life hasn't been the same since.  And I'm delighted!<br />If you're looking for a carefully analyzed, dress-for-success, statistically footnoted guide to fashion, this isn't it.  Likewise, if you read it with red pen in hand, noting where the pace is too slow and where the logic falters, you probably won't like this book.  It's unapologetically frivolous and fun.<br />BUT... If you want a good, light poolside read with plenty of smiles, this is a great choice.  You may also reconnect with childhood fantasies, in the very best ways.<br />This book is still on my nightstand for when the day has worn me down a bit.  After reading just a few pages of it, I slip off to dreamland with visions of pink bubblebaths, fluffy maribou high-heeled slippers, and boxes of soft-centered chocolates.	2004-07-12

This book doesn't feature fads, but instead offers good, solid advice.  Was it Diane Vreeland that said that style is timeless?  That applies to Barbara and this book.<br />I've taken Barbara's great class at Education Week, and wanted something permanent to remind me of the many great tips that she shares.  This book includes Barbara's advice, as well as her personal story for insights... and she shows photos of herself going from no makeup to dazzlingly made-up, step by step.  Wow!<br />There's a very good reason why she's successfully coached so many girls and women in beauty pageants: She knows what looks attractive, and how to get there.<br />If you want to look like a high-fashion waif from the cover of Vogue, this book isn't for you.

When I'm fully bogged--which happens more often than I'd like to admit--Ms. Kingston's books help me disengage myself from the overwhelming STUFF that binds my imagination and keeps me from creating--and living--to my fullest.  This is not a &quot;fad&quot; kind of book, but a book to treasure, re-read, and share with others.	2004-05-01

I regularly teach classes about making art shrines, and this book provides glorious and diverse examples of what you can do with shrines and shadowboxes.  If you've enjoyed scrapbooking and two-dimensional art but are ready to explore something with more visual contrast, drama and (literal) depth, this is a tremendous book to own.  You'll refer to it often.<br />Really, I've been teaching shrine-making to other artists for over three years now, and I don't need to buy ho-hum books.  I have enough great ideas in my head already.  But, when I need a fresh source of inspiration or to broaden my approach to this kind of art, this book is wonderful.<br />Whether you're new to this form or art, or an experienced assemblage artist, I recommend this book.	2003-08-15

However, what worked in the past century and before the Internet, is not working now.  From &quot;Cluetrain&quot; to &quot;Gonzo Marketing,&quot; there's ample proof of that.<br />But, if you're self-employed and/or building your online identity... how do you start?  And, if you've been online for awhile but you're somehow missing the boat--or at least your audience--what do you do without a corporate advertising budget and webmaster/advisors to help you?<br />The answer is simple: You get this book.  And read it.  I've read Chapter Two at least ten times, and I'm still making notes about what I'm changing on my own website (online since 1995, and boy-oh-boy have I made mistakes! *sigh*).<br />Baker's books are not for wimps.  And, they're not the sitcom version of business, where you spend a few days creating a by-the-numbers clone of others' websites, and then sit back expecting income to flood in like clockwork.<br />Instead of being a book that you read, say, &quot;Oh, that made some good points,&quot; and then put on a shelf to collect dust, this is a book that you'll read, re-read, and keep close to hand.  Baker's book is information-packed.  There is no way that you'll learn it all in one reading, or even two.<br />This is easily in the top five books that everyone who is (or wants to be) in business online MUST own.  Sure, you can read the sample chapters at Baker's website, or take this book out of the library, but it contains too much important advice for that.  And, you'll refer to it often, as well.<br />Buy this book.  Roll up your sleeves and do what he says.  It's how to succeed on- and offline, in the 21st century.  It's not your parents' business era anymore.  Learn the new rules in this book, and give yourself a genuine chance for success.<br />Baker's information would be cheap at ten times the price; it's already helped me to increase the daily hits at one of my websites from 500/day to over 800/day.  And, I'm still on Chapter Three!me to increase the daily hits at one of my websites from 500/day to over 800/day.  And, I'm still on Chapter Three!	2003-08-15

If you've ever felt &quot;stuck&quot; or as if people weren't really paying attention to you... if you're an artist and frustrated with your own work or how others perceive some of your work... if you've ever wanted to be an artist, but didn't feel &quot;good enough&quot;... You need this tape set.  No, I don't mean you should hear it someday; I mean that you need to get this tape set right NOW.  You need to hear it.  (That should be in neon lights, flashing in front of your monitor.)  Put &quot;The Creative Fire&quot; on your tape player and take out a box of tissues.  If you listen to it in the car, be prepared when Dr. Estes starts reading from her poem, &quot;How to Silence a Woman,&quot; because you may be ready to vent, big time, right then &amp; there.  She's telling you the truth you've needed to hear since forever.  I repeat: if you've ever felt creative, or wanted to do something creative, and felt stuck or sad or not good enough, at ANY step in the creative process (including when you finished it), you need this tape set.  It is the most significant message I've heard in the past year, at least.  It is really, really, REALLY important.	2001-09-26

I stayed up most of the night to finish reading it; I literally could not put it down.  It's not often that I can describe a book at filled with gritty realism AND hauntingly beautiful writing, but that is my best summary of this fictionalized biography of Marie Laveau.  However, while I appreciate what the author accomplished in explaining the troubling aspects of the Marie Laveau legends, this book was not a fun read for me.  Then again, when I watch TV or go to the movies, I choose comedies, so I want to stress that this is purely a matter of taste.  This book is a fabulous page-turner, and I am grateful for the deep historical research and insights this book provides.  If you prefer realism to fantasy, or savor rich and vivid writing above all, you'll like this book.  That said, while I rate the writing style high, I'd rather not think of Marie Laveau in this context.	2001-09-03

The illustrations are simple and inspiring if you're working with mixed media and want to head more towards authentic folk art. Finally, if you're a believer, the personal stories of how each type of milagro is used are very touching. This is a short book, filled with ample colorful illustrations, introducing you to milagros. For example, if you've seen little lips as a silver or golden charm and wondered what it meant, this book will explain. To dig deeper into religious and artistic traditions, you'll want a different book, but this is a fine place to start your exploration of these ancient talismans.	2001-09-03

It shows clear links between Catholic and Vodou imagery and themes, and the art is inspiring. The color photos are rich &amp; wonderful, and consistent enough to provide a clear understanding of Haitian and Vodou artistic/spiritual traditions. In this case, a picture (or pictures in this book anyway) are worth more than 1000 words.

If you've ever picked up a self-help book in a bitter moment and muttered, &quot;Yeah, right, what planet is SHE on?&quot; but felt more like dissolving into a little puddle of misery, desperate for SOMETHING to help get you unstuck... this is the book you want to own.	2001-08-19

Suddenly, you'll spot Prayer to Glorious Elegua, Prayer to the 7 Psalms of the Holy Sacrament, Prayer to the Spirit of Desperation, Prayer to the 7 African Powers, Prayer to Win the Lottery, and many more.<br /><br />In other words, if you're interested in Santeria, Voudou, or related traditions, this is a must-own book.<br /><br />And, to add a personal anecdote, I tried a few of the money prayers, and within 48 hours received $161.01 from unexpected sources.  Sure, it could be coincidence, but it was a little weird.  I'll respectfully consider that it was the prayers, and say thanks to St. Rita (and others) for extra help.<br /><br />If you're interested in African-related and Carribbean-based traditions, this book is well worth the cover price.  But, beginners may see only pages of Catholic prayers, with some funky illustrations.	2001-08-19

Read &quot;Jambalaya&quot; by Luisah Teish instead.<br />However, if you want to step back in time to 1950's racism--complete with the N-word--and dark rumors about Voodoo, this is the book to read.  Frankly, I was horrified to note Martinez' condescending, sometimes sneering, stereotypes.  This book is already in my stack of paper to recycle.<br />For example, Martinez says that a loincloth is &quot;the customary dress of the Negroes in Haiti, and for that matter, South Africa and most tropical countries.&quot;  And, he advises us that Marie LaVeau's snake, Zombi, &quot;fed only upon fair and tender children.&quot;<br />In describing Voodoo, Martinez claims, &quot;Marie's rituals were, of course, so outrageously vulgar that children were forbidden to witness them...no person who pretended to be self-respecting could admit that so depraved a performance was enjoyable or even interesting.&quot;<br />But, as another reviewer noted, you can use this book to locate newspaper articles from Marie LaVeau's era.  Otherwise, it's a waste of paper, unless you want to see what once passed for a generous and kindly attitude towards people and traditions of African descent.	2001-08-13

Originally published in the 1950's, this book includes folklore and legends, as well as academic notes.<br />If you're interested in this subject, &quot;Vodou Visions&quot; by Glassman is a better choice for beginners, or &quot;Jambalaya&quot; by Luisah Teish to explore women's spirituality, particularly Voudou- and African-related.  Both of those books are vastly easier to read, and more current.<br />However, for thorough research into Vodun/Voudoo/Voodoo, this book provides extensive information, and some unrelated but insightful notes to lead you deeper into the context of African-based traditions.	2001-08-13

For example, star-shaped books (looking from  above, not pages cut out in star shapes), books with three-dimensional  pages (like classic Italian stage design), and books using innovative  approaches, not just &quot;pop up&quot; stuff.  If you choose rubber stamps  that are &quot;NOT cute,&quot; then you'll like this book.  No, it doesn't  have anything to do with rubber stamping, per se, but I'm making a point:  Real artists will love this book.  Within hours of just browsing through  this book, I had already set up a major bookmaking project that is  tremendous fun, and more personally expressive than most paperart projects  I do.

There are over 400 photos in the book, which say it all.<br /><br />If you're working with jewelry for costuming or historical reference, start with this extensive survey of jewelry styles over seven centuries.<br /><br />Great information!	2000-03-14

This book practically leaped off the shelf, into my hands, and I'm so glad that it did!  This is easily one of Z's best and most accessible, and she shares well-researched ideas that others often overlook, despite their importance.  Her map of what happens in what years of your life... well, that proved amazingly accurate.  Almost spooky.  I wish I'd had this info fifteen years ago.<br /><br />This book relies heavily on Pagan and Wiccan themes, as well as astrological cycles.  If you're offended by them, even slightly, this isn't the book for you.<br /><br />Likewise, though this information is often as true for men as it is for women, most men won't warm to Z's attitudes or writing style.<br /><br />However, if you're a woman who embraces diverse spiritual references and contexts, and can accept the logic (if not the science) of cyclical influences in our lives, this book is compelling.  If you're approaching age 30 or 50, this is the road map.	2000-03-04

Quirky, full of interviews and inspiring b&w illustrations, from Cher (without any makeup) to Gilda Radner to Betsey Johnson... and more!<br /><br />Brilliant ideas and inspirational photos.  I absolutely love this book!  If I could own only one fashion book, this might be it.	2000-02-14

Even if you can't draw a stick figure, but have always wanted to be an artist, this book will  set you on the path to creative expression.  Don't just wish to be an  artist... get this book, and start painting!	2000-02-14

I'm not certain that I take dreams very seriously, but Buckland has Rom ancestry and if this is his family's tradition regarding dream interpretation... well, why not have fun with it?  This text is not  presented as a deeply academic work, and if you enjoy dream books, this one  is at least as good as--and perhaps better than--most in print today.  I  like Buckland's writing style, and this book is fairly easy to use.  (And,  yes, I have Traveler ancestry myself.)	2000-02-14

It's ideal if you're using the Tarot as a meditation tool, or for personal insights.  (You do not have to believe that the Tarot predicts the future. The Tarot can serve a purpose far beyond that.)<br /><br />Whether you're a beginner or a pro, this is a must-own book.	2000-02-14

I refer to my own worn copy of this book, regularly.  If you're trying to determine your own &quot;look,&quot; this book is helpful.	2000-02-14

This author speaks calmly and sensibly, sometimes using Christian phrases and  concepts, and explains how to make your life happier and more fun.  It's a  good book with well-grounded ideas.  Recommended.	1999-05-22

I'm a former model who didn't have a clue about how I looked, until I read this book.  Today, my copy may be falling apart from frequent use, but it's the single most-important book to read and understand when you're trying to  look your best.  Nobody else explains how important it is, to look like YOU.  Forget trying to conceal your \\"faults,\\" Kibbe shows you how  they're really your assets!  Yes, some of the advice is dated (1980s) but the essence of what Kibbe says is timeless.  This book is a unique wake-up to what WORKS.	1999-02-23

However, while it shows superb writing skill and a wonderful use of words, I found the stories a  little too cynical and depressing for my liking.  I did laugh out loud now  &amp; then... but not enough, and that's what I'd bought the book for.<br />If  you're looking for fine Irish literature, this is probably a good choice.  If you also want a lot of laugh-out-loud humor, you might want to look at  other titles.	1999-01-10

If you want more control over your finances and you use Quicken, this book is vital!	1998-06-17
