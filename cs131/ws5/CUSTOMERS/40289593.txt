By no means am I knocking the usefulness of direct marketing, but I am certain that many businesses could benefit greatly from these other two methods of promotion, depending of course on the type of service they are offering. An obvious example of this might be a lawn care service who in my opinion would benefit greatly from knocking on doors.<br /><br />As far as handling leads once you have them , how to deal with arguments and closing the sale I believe that the book is an excellent reference especially for people that don't have much experience selling intangibles.<br /><br />This is a good oveall handbook for any service providing small business that wants to learn how to maximize his or her results with their potential clients.	2005-07-18

It is a well written classy book that I personally admire. It is definately a book for foodies and not a quick reference for some quick dinner ideas.<br /><br />The recipes are very obviously real and tested and if one wishes to acheive the best results do not try to take shortcuts. As far as finding certain ingredients, there is a wealth of resources availible online and virtualy any ingredient that you can imagine can be found if you look.	2005-07-17

I purchased several books as I had never actually worked in the business and was looking for guidance. This book was an invaluable resource and helped me in developing my business plan and guided me through the initial steps of this endeavor. Most every concern is covered in laymans terms to help amatuer restaurantuers avoid classic pitfalls.<br /><br />The book deserves a good rating, and not the low ratings that other readers hve given it. Rate the book for what it is; a guide for the beginner and not a college textbook that would cover every last detail of a restaurant operation.	2005-07-17

With questions like \\"what are we arguing about?\\" and \\"why argue\\" answered and by identifying different types of arguments, the reader is equipped with a plan to avoid falling into dead-end arguments and getting sucked into agreement which he may later regret. It is truly a helpful guide in polishing your negotiating skills whether for buying a car or negotiating with your spouse.<br /><br />I have used the techniques described within and was surprised with how simple but effective theese techniqes really are. Great book!	2005-07-04

This has been one of my proudest purchases of cookbooks in quite some time, although I really shouldn't call it a cookbook because it is so much more.<br /><br />Apart from the extraordinary photography of French dishes, there are numerous photos of the French countryside, architecture and local produce.<br /><br />The book is separated into regions based on the wines that are produced there and of course every recipe includes that respective variety in it's list of ingredients. I will admit that despite the excellent explanations and detailed instruction which accompany each dish, many of the recipes are quite daunting and many of the ingredients are quite difficult to find. This of course will make it difficult for most home cooks to actually execute many of them unless of course patience prevails. Having said that, this book is a real pleasure just to sit down on your couch and read with a nice glass of wine!	2005-07-04

Very basic information on each chapter without expanding in any detail on the intricacies of this particular business.<br /><br />The marketing chapter in particular which was the main reson for me buying the book gave me a couple of ideas but overall didn't read any different than any small buisiness marketing guide. Dated information written in a fairly bland language without any hint of enthousiasm.<br /><br />I suppose that if you are on a budget with no experience at all, this is an ok referece source but you will want to upgrade to something more comprehensive and in depth such as the professional caterers handbook by Laura Arduser and Robert Brown<br /><br />The most unfortunate thing about this book is it's author. Following my above review I received the following email from the author who obviously has a much higher opinion of her work than I do. Personally I found her message to be quite sarcastic, as I have not indicated that I have personally published anything. :<br /><br />Dear Cosmos,<br />I just read your review of my catering book on Amazon. You are right, your review was out of the norm.<br />I've sold 140,000 copies and recieve emails daily from around the country, from students, schools, professionals etc. thanking me.<br />If,  you'd like a complimentary copy of the new 5th edition, and try to read it again, I'd be happy to send<br />you one in the fall. Much new information in the marketing chapter.<br />Please make sure to send me information on any of the books you've published,<br />I 'd love to read what you know, I'm sure if would fill volumes.<br />Denise Vivaldo	2005-07-04

I happen to disagree with this opinion as there are no prerequisites required to understand the instruction given within. Having said this, if you are not even curious of understading the fundamentals of lets say for example, sausage making, there is no need to buy this book, you can find great sausage at the grocery store without the hassle of making it at home.<br /><br />So this book, yes it is for professionals but also for anybody who wants to understand (and even apply)the nuts and bolts of the cold kitchen. Personally I think that understanding the method that is used to prepare something, gives one a greater appreciation of that something when it is offered to him/her.<br /><br />So for all of you non-professionals, if you are simply curious, about how to make salad dressings, terrines, or bologna for that matter, this book is written in laymans terms and will be an interesting journey into the world of Garde Manger.	2005-07-01

This is much more than a cookbook and rightly deserves it's title. Many people associate Mexican cooking with tamales, tacos and burritos which is no surprise as many of the Mexican restaurants in the US limit their menus to such items. This book goes beyond what Americans consider traditional Mexican cooking and highlights many of the recipes derived from their Spanish ancestors, executed with local ingredients.<br /><br />This oversized book is separated into regions and includes recipes as well as detailed information on the country. There is an extensive chapter on seafood including some excellent recipes which shouldn't come as a surprise since Mexico boasts a 6000 mile coastline. Extensive photography is also included in this book making it a suitable for anybody. If you can find a spot for it on your bookshelve, buy this book!	2005-07-01

As other reviewers have stated it is a bit complicated so if you are just looking for an easy to prepare BBQ sauce, don't buy this.<br /><br />If on the other hand you want to understand, learn and master the techniques for making sauces there is no better reference guide that has been published.<br /><br />There is an important chapter on stocks which explains the significance and the technique for extracting flavors from, meats, bones and vegetables, to form the base for the sauces which are covered in the book. This particular chapter goes into more depth than my culinary textbook and has been an invaluable guide for me in my profession.<br /><br />Mother sauces and small sauces, as classified by Escoffier, are covered as well as many contemporary sauces, but most importantly this book will give you the knowledge and desire to experiment with ingredients that are availible to you.<br /><br />Buy this book fearlessly, it is well worth the price and then some!

Are you confused about how to build flavors and balance out a dish?<br /><br />Cooking is an art and preparing a satisfying meal that you will be proud of when your guests rant and rave requires that you understand what you are doing and why. If you are able to understand the fundamentals behind the technique, you open the doors to being able to create your own masterpieces without the assistance of a cookbook using your artistic talents and knowledge.<br /><br />Culinary artistry is a book that is required reading for any individual that wishes to understand the fundamentals of cooking and be able to move beyond basic usage of cookbooks following each step, basically blindfolded. It is a book that should be read from cover to cover but can also serve as a reference guide. On the surface you can look up various ingredients and see what goes best with what or you can read the entire book and gain valuable knowledge, as for example, why cranberry sauce goes well with Turkey at your thanksgiving dinner table.	2005-05-05

Arborio or Carnaroli rice depending on your choice requires a certain method to extract all of the creaminess from the rice while maintaining a good al dente texture.

By no means could this book be considered complete as it's title suggests.<br /><br />Many of the recipes are classic but only occasionally offer an explanation of what the dish is.<br />For example there is a recipe for \\"Mock Magiritsa\\" which is a soup traditionally prepared on the eve of Greek Easter. After returning from church service celebrating the resurection of Christ, families would gather around the table and enjoy this rich soup which is made of the innards of the lamb that will be cooked on the spit the following morning.<br /><br />Well you may say that this information is not absolutely necessary but I think it is the writers responsibility especially when the writers are the church itself, to give a bit of backround to what one is attempting to prepare and the significance of the dish.<br /><br />Anyway there are better books out there, the authors in my opinion put very little into producing this book despite the vast resources of information that they had at their disposal. Personally I would avoid this one and try for something else	2005-05-02

This cookbook lives in my kitchen, my sisters, my mothers, my aunts... and it is a great book and good reference guide, to an extent. There are many recipes for many different types of dishes and as reviewer Jennifer Blunt put it there are quite a few good recipes in here but also quite a few inconsistencies.<br /><br />Having said all of this, my advice is not to take this book as an authority on anything! The results on alot of the recipes are great but in my opinion there are certain recipes such as Gumbo for example (page 382) that need to adhere to certain guidelines in order to call it gumbo. Julie Rosso has made the cardinal sin of not including the initial step of starting with a brown roux, a process that gives the dish it's distinctive color and flavor and takes a long time to do (1 to 1 1/2 hours). This is an example and I would beleive that there are more such mistakes. Shame on you Julie.<br /><br />Still despite this negative comment if you can pick up a used copy of this book for a few dollars, it is a good buy as you can find many dishes to make your family quite pleased!	2005-03-31

Manhattan, Mint Julep, Old Fashioned, Rob Roy, Rusty Nail, Whiskey sour, and the list goes on, are neither unique nor relevant to the main subject, Tapas.

One of the things that I liked about this book is that it gave suggestions to alter the ethnicity by slightly changing some of the ingredients, turning it from Egyptian for example to Lebanese. The books first 50 pages are a Middle_eastern culinary lesson in the history and evolution of Middle-Eastern food.  <br /> <br />Read the how to use this book to help you navigate through the book as it is a bit confusing at first. The recipes are generally good although I disagree on some of the short cuts and substitutions (for example I have always known Muhammara to contain roasted red peppers and not tomato paste) but overall it is the most authentic book that I have been able to find. <br /> <br />	2005-03-29

I have traveled throuout the country and have tried several of the dishes that appear in this book but until now was not able to succesfully duplicate them. I was quite excited when I came across this collection and give the author five stars for her tremendous effort of bringing them together unadulterated.<br /><br />This book is exactly what it claims to be, if not more than it claims to be and most definately deserves a five star rating. As a few other reviewers have mentioned it is not a collection of Americanized versions of Mousaka and Pastitsio, but a comprehensive collection of recipes borrowed from kitchens across the country which may or may not appeal to all palates. Many of these dishes you will not find outside it's reigion of origin let alone at Kostas opa on Main Street USA. It is worth mentioning that the author has traveled accross Greece collecting these recipes, many of which have not been published before. Having said all of this if you are looking for a recipe for Mousaka, run a search on Google and you will get 100s of results but if you wish to experiment and test your pallate try this book.

If you are interested in learning some of the history behind what the Spaniards eat depending on their region this is the perfect book for you. There are no glossy pictures here but the detailed explanations make up for that.<br /><br />One thing that is missing here is a reference of where to find some of the ingredients utilized in Spanish cuisine. \\"Cesar\\" by Olivier Said and James Mellgren offers such a reference (the best one in my opinion is tienda.com) and I stongly advise using authentic ingredients and not the chorizo from your local grocery store.

As a food industry professional, I am quite selective about the books I choose to add to my cook book collection.<br />A few of the reviewers here are correct in saying that the book is not 100% vegetarian but for me, not a vegetarian that's fine. The nice thing about cooking is that you do have the option of ommiting or adding ingredients to please your individual tastes.<br /><br />The recipes in this book are divided by country with recipes that cover all continents with the exception of Australia (and yes there is such a thing as Australian cuisine but good luck finding ingredients). There are soup, entree and dessert recipes for each region with very consice directions and useful footnotes where appropriate. No photos whatsoever, but if you follow the recipe carefully you shouldn't have to worry about that at all.<br /><br />This particular book was introduced to me by a very talented chef who used to work for me in my restaurant in Australia. I have since come accross two other chefs who have this book in their collection and use it for inspiration and motivation to come up with tasty vegetarian dishes!
