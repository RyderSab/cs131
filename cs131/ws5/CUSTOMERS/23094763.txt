I like BDSM novels so I picked it up for that simple fact...the only thing that made me cautious was a friend of mine had told me that its not for the faint of heart, which i'm defiently not, but I do not however like stories envolving beastiality and this one as my friend had said, included it. But after reading the novel, which grips you from the very first page, the story and plot more than exceeded my expectations. You feel sorry for the \\"dead sister\\" and even more sorry at least to me for the sister who is trying to figure out who killed her sister. Although the story does give few twist and turns overall it was extremely easy to figure out and the ending, to me was justified. Kudos to Laura Reese on a brillant book.	2005-08-28

I have to say that I have read a few Erin McCarthy novels and out of all of them this has got to be my favorite of them all. Both Houston and Josie are so likeable that you just gotta love them. The only problem I had was the constant blabbering about her weight, why oh why do women have to think that a guy who looks at you like he could devour you has a problem with the way they look...getting old in the romance genre. I mean, if the guy likes you enough to look at you like you are edible he doesn't to much care about your weight and he's got no problem with it. Other than that simple fact the novel is a fun fast paced read that will have you screaming in frustration, laughing hysterically and crying all wrapped in one...I just love Erin's books!	2005-07-06

I haven't read a lot of Edward Lee's books but of those I have Flesh Gothic has got to be one of his best. I love how his imagination takes on the haunted house storyline and weaves in satanic rituals. His books are filled with gore (some of it is alittle bit more than even I can handle, and I like some gory sh**).  Definetly not for the faint of heart.  <br /> <br />This book was well written and I wish it would be turned into a movie, it would make a great horror film.  Edward Lee is truly one of the masters of horrors.  <br /> <br />You can read the book description to find out what this book is about but I promise you, if you like horror you will love this book.  The ending to almost all of his books that I have read so far blows my mind. Each of his books are orginal and I can't get enough of them. He is the first author that has kept me guessing right up to the very end. The only problem I have found with his writing is the in-depth details that he has, albeit most of them are necessary to the story, it is just a lot for my fragile mind to process at one time. <br /> <br />Anywho, I think if you like most of today's horror writers and gore/sex doesn't bother you then please check out Edward Lee.	2005-06-19

This was the first novel I have read by Angela Knight, although I have read her short stories in the Bite and Cravings anthologies. They were my favorite in both books so I was definetly going to buy this book, after I did I was not diappointed. Her stories are filled with the right amount of romance, sex, and action.  Her writing is perfect, and is right up there with my favorite authors. She's writes her hero and heroines witty and funny.  Along with the very arousing love scenes her ability to write action sequences is surprising not what you normally expect from a romance author. Knight has talent and I can't wait to read her next novel.	2005-06-17

A few months ago I read Bite, in which her short story Galahad was in it. After reading her new take on vampires, witches and Arthurian lore I just couldn't get enough. So I bought the Hot Blooded anthology and read her short in it, which was better than Galahad. After which I was addicted to the Mageverse (the world where all of it takes place) and I couldn't wait to get my hands on another story by her. <br /> <br />After picking up Master of the Night I couldn't wait for Master of the Moon. This one however is a little bit different since it revolves around King Llyr (fairy King) and a female werewolf who lives on Earth. The romance between the two is very realistic and I couldn't get enough of them. The sex was hot and steamy. This book is a little on the gory side since they are after a female vampire who is killing men left and right in the werewolf's small southern town which is also a continue from Master of the Night. <br /> <br />IF you enjoy all her other novels you will not be disappointed, she's a terrific paranormal erotic romance writer.

The story was wonderfully written, it made you smile laugh and almost cry.  The love between the three characters is so engaging and mesmerizing. I have read a few books dealing with menage a trois and none of them affected me like this one, you could relate to all of the characters. I also loved how the story ended, it was just how I would have if I had wrote it. <br /> <br />If you have something against f/m/m erotica then you wouldn't like this book but if not I say definetly check this book out because you will not be disappointed.

This book sounded really good, and it probably would have been terrific if it wasn't for the constant whining of the main character. I mean geez for a vampire he sure acted like a baby. The book consisted of \\"I love you\\" \\"Get away\\" \\"But I love you\\" \\"Get away from me\\". One minute he wants the girl the next he tries to get rid of her then whines about not having her then gets her back...its a neverending cycle right up to the end. About half way through the book I was wishing Gabriel (the vampire) would just suck it up and walk out into the daylight. <br /> <br />Not one of the better vampire romances, but if you like your main character to be a 400 year old whiney baby then this book is for you. As for the actual bloodsucking scenes they could have been A LOT better, seriously not what I was expecting.	2005-06-06

I have to say after reading Dead Witch Walking I was utterly amazed at how Kim Harrison could tell a story. Usually, first person point of views to me are lacking great storytelling, but with Kim Harrison's bounty hunter series it takes on a whole new meaning.  I love the life of Rachel Morgan. The supporting characters are also wonderfully written and are not just used as filler.  This novel surpassed the first and I am really looking forward to the third installment.  <br /> <br />The first book made you love certain characters and hate the others, a couple in the second book stays that way but one in particular stood out, Trent. In the first book I hated him and wished she could take him down but now after reading the second book, I look upon Trent in a whole new light. I am hoping that something happens between Rachel and him, or maybe its just me.  <br /> <br />If you enjoyed the first book you will find that the second is just as great! Way to go Harrison, another terrific novel!	2005-05-30

I was extremely pleased with this book as I always am when purchasing a Sookie Stackhouse novel. She has to be my favorite heroine out of all the vamp/were novels out their, she is down to earth and actually just a normal twentysomething small town girl with just a few minor problems that I as a reader can relate to more. <br /> <br />When the last book left off I was very sad because I wanted to hurry up and find out the result of Eric and Sookie's love life. By the end of this book however, and my only complaint for the whole novel is I'm still sad, it could have been at least a few more pages long....  *tears running down cheeks* thats all I can say without spoiling it for those who haven't read the novel.  <br /> <br />I did enjoy the Sookie/Calvin relationship in this one, although I really don't find Calvin all that attractive he is a really sweet man and I hope to see more of him in the future. The murder mystery like some have already said, in a series its extremely easy to figure out who it is in the first few chapters, but oh well, I read these novels for Sookie's love life anyway. *Smiles* <br /> <br />The introduction of a new guy, Quinn (thinks thats it) was really great and I really wish he could have been in more, maybe he will be in the next book. I reallllllly liked him! <br />Anyway, this book was a really great read, got it yesterday afternoon and read it until 5am this morning, I just couldn't put it down. Its really terrific and you begin to care a lot more about all the added characters...just read the book, you'll see!	2005-05-28

I've read a lot of erotica and this has to be one of my favorite books I have read in a long time. The plot pulled me in and took me to another world. I felt compelled to help the main charater, Lulu, I felt sorry for her and wanted to hold her and make everything better for her, to norture her.  A lot of people can relate to this story because most of us have found ourselves having a crush on someone much older when you are young. She fell in love with her brothers best friend, a much older man. The romance between them were erotic and breathtaking at the same time, even though you could slap her husband, Pablo, for being an ass he soon turns the tables and you find yourself ooing and aahing because you can tell he loves Lulu so much.  Albeit the scene with Pablo, Lulu and her brother was a bit much, you still wished for everything to end happily.  Lulu's sexual quest throughout the novel was I think a self discovery and also a punishment. As a young girl she felt unloved and met a man who not only nortured her like a father, but loved her as a man. If that makes sense.  I really enjoyed this novel, the story will stay with me for a long time.	2005-05-27
US	23094763	R1OICRP7API1LG	1562014579	618603330	Sinful Deceit	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Could have been better	Okay, first like the other reviewer this novel is not for the faint of heart. I like hardcore erotica and BDSM but some of this novel was more than I could handle. After reading it I felt like I had to take a shower because I felt filthy. The novel as a whole was pretty good, some of the antics that happened to the main character was pretty sick and extreme. The problem I had mainly with this novel was the main character. At first I related to her at the beginning, I connected to her, which is what normally a book is aimed at. But by the end of the novel I was willing her to die, every page I turned I wanted worse and worse things happening to her. She became whiney and I wanted to strangle her and smack her around. The whole novel she's complaining about doing this and that but secretly I felt like she enjoyed what was happening to her. <br /> <br />Any normal person, even teenagers, would question recieving a letter from a mysterious \\"Uncle\\" she had never met. I mean come on, hello! Check the guy out before traveling hundreds of miles from home to meet him. Geez!  After she realized all is not what it seems she could have faught back, but no, she took whatever they dished out. I mean for pete's sake at least try to defend yourself. When someone is basically being raped they don't sit there and enjoy it! <br /> <br />The novel had a decent plot if only the main character had stopped whining and tried to fight back it would have been a lot better. Also another thing at the end I felt cheated, could have been a lot better ending.	2005-05-20

Many people have already wrote what this book is about so I won't get into that. All I have to say is this book was excellent also it was a pretty good thriller.  I fell in love with David...he was such a sweetheart and romantic that my husband needs to take pointers! At times I hated Chloe for how she treated him although I understood her lack of trust and love issues, and she was the perfect witch but with a capital B!  Near the end I just wanted everything to be perfect and they live happily ever after because they both deserved it. Sato's character had me crying. I felt so sorry for him, he loved David soooo much and David was oblivious to any affection he showed. The only thing I would have changed was I would have added a threesome between David, Sato, and Chloe, although that might have complicated things alittle but Sato deserved happiness and in the end I think he found it. IT was a perfect erotic romance, one I think men would also enjoy. Keep up the good job Emma!	2005-03-29
US	23094763	RJQ8SUR2K6FY5	0425198219	335481412	Strange Attractions	Books	3	9	11	N	N	hmmm.....where to start	I've recently become a fan of Emma Holly's work. I've only read a couple of her novels and by far when I started reading this one I was expecting her usual erotic words mesmirizing me...but sadly to say this novel really didn't do that at all. The characters themselves weren't written poorly but the whole mind boggling Quantum Physics part made my brain hurt. I felt like I was back in my high school science class.  However erotic this novel was the sexual interaction between the characters left me feeling less than satisfied, it was more fantasy than actual reality. Most of her novels that I have read so far have been more of a reality based world between her characters but this one just didn't have that umph.  The character, B.G., was to me shallow and unloving, even though he claimed to love both Charity and Eric who was his best friend and lover, I just didn't feel like he did. The love between Charity and Eric was kinda realistic and I felt that it was genuine, although Eric claimed to love B.G. also, I felt that his love toward his friend was mainly out of pity. <br /> <br />As a whole the novel wasn't that bad although it would have been more interesting to have the whole \\"ghost\\" plot expanded upon and made this more of a supernatural tale than supposedly realistic. I also am beginning to see a pattern between Emma's books regarding the whole gay-straight men.  Its like she writes just about all straight men having an underlying sexual desire to be intimate with another man.  Maybe she believes this, but most men I know of don't sit around wishing to be taken by another man...some granted do...just not everyone. IMO I think that her views of homosexual and heterosexual men are more fantasy based aimed more to please women.	2005-03-29

This has to be one of my favorite erotic series that I have ever read. There are four novels in the series so far but I hope that McCray writes at least one more about the sister. This is the first in the series and it was probably my favorite. The series is very erotic and the sex is absolutly breathtaking.  It does have what I would consider light bondage, nothing too risque. The whole plot of the series is about four brothers who have to find their mate from another realm so that there kingdoms can prosper once again and hopefully break the curse that was bestowed upon them from their evil sister. There are a lot of male/female/male and some female/female scenes. It has a variety of sex scenes and everytime there is something more that makes you go mmmmm...	2005-03-06

It was one of the first that I have read from Ellora's Cave. It was extremely good. I love the chase that happens between the two twin brothers and the princess. She is aroused by the two men, I mean geez who wouldn't they sounded dreamy, but she is so afraid of the possibility of what would happen that she subdues her attraction for them. The sex is steamy as with all of the authors from Ellora's Cave.  If male/female/male novels are your thing then you should definetly check this one out, even if you aren't the plot of this novel was an engrossing one so even if you are skeptical you should still give it a chance.	2005-03-06

It has everything I love in an erotic novel. Sexy men, wonderfully erotic sex scenes, and plenty of action! It was well worth the read. This novel blended blood/gore/action/sex into one steamy kick-ass novel! It is about a group of hunters that happen to be aliens, that track down demons and kill them. On earth this woman also has psychic powers and she also tracks and kills the ones that have started showing up on earth.

The plot was terrific and the characters were witty. Also the book was filled with blood which adds to any book. McKinley's New World was a fantastic one, wish more authors had that much imagination.  It was a refreshing outlook on vampires. The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars was the simple fact that most of the 300 odd pages were filled with sooooo many descriptions. My mind was on detail overload. Descriptions are fine as long as they pretain to the story and not just used as fillers. The main character, Sunshine, is telling the story, which is fine, I like first person narrative. But there is only sooo many times I can read about making cinnamon buns till it just gets aggrivating.  I also wish that there had been more dialogue, I would have liked more interaction between the characters and not just from Sunshines point of view. Overall the story was really good, it was enjoyable however I doubt I will re-read it. I do hope she writes a sequel only because of how the book ends. It needs a sequel.	2005-02-19

It turned out that this one wasn't that enjoyable, it was simply a filler that I thought didn't really need to be written. It supposedly filled in some of the question the reader has about the time frame between Blue Moon and Obsidian Butterfly but it left me with more questions.  The Sookie Stackhouse short wasn't as I had hoped but hopefully it's leading into the next installment. Angela Knights \\"Galahad\\" was extremely hot. I thought this one was one of the better vampire shorts in a while. Also the MaryJanice Davidson story was really good, I haven't read her undead series so now after reading this short story I think I will. Last but certainly not least was the Vickie Taylor short story \\"Blood Lust\\" that story was my favorite out of them all. I wished it had been longer though, it was good enough to be made into a whole novel. Overall I think if you love vampire romance then pick this anthology up. I was extremely pleased with purchasing it and I thought it was a lot better than Cravings. I finished the whole novel in less than three hours so it was rather short, but a good compulation between romance and erotica.	2005-01-26

This is my favorite book in the southern vampire series. If you are a fan of romance/vampires/shifters then this book is for you.  The only problem I have found with all the books in the series is that they feel like they are way tooooo short.  I love how Charlaine lets you see more openly into Eric's soul although its just for a little while. IF only he could stay that way he would be perfect.

I had never read anything from this author and I bought it mainly b/c I had to fulfill my book club agreement, and I have got to say it was well worth my money. I've been a fan of the Anita Blake series for awhile now and I thought it was one of the best vampire stories that was until I read these books. Its more lighthearted and not so much focused on sex that I enjoyed the southern vampire series more. I just love Sookie Stackhouse. These books are well written and makes you wish you were Sookie, although sometimes I could have strangled her. I can't wait to read the rest of the series b/c I'm looking forward to seeing how her character developes. So BUY THIS BOOK AND READ THE WHOLE SERIES! You want be disappointed.	2004-11-02

About five chapters of this novel is filled with crime solving the other 77 is LKH excuse for Anita to sleep with every male character that is willing to have her, and lets just say even the \\"I thought he was gay\\" guy shagged her.  Sadly when I bought ID I knew that this was probably going to be some porn movie in book form and I was right.  Although hoping deep down that things had finally changed, that this could infact be the redeeming book for Anita, it is not, SO NOT!  Although it was filled with sex, the book did show a few good character devolpments.  Most pleasing is Richard, he has now left my LKH should just kill him phase.  Really pleased how his character has finally turned around, as long as it will last.  JC showed amazing devolpment, he is now something more than just a power hungry sex-filled vampire.  All in all i'm pleased with this book b/c I knew what to expect, slim plot filled with sex, really wish LKH would go back to the root of the novels so we could actually see more crime solving murder investigations like we did in OB.  I really wish Edward had made an appearance, can't wait to see his take on Anita's new life, i guess he will also be one that \\"takes one for the team\\" as Jason very well did.	2004-10-13

The book flowed rather well and kept me interested throughout.  Poppy has a pretty good sense of describing things really well.  I could litterly see myself in Missing Mile, NC living the hellish nightmare of that dreadful place.  The story like others have said, has great character devolpment.  The only thing I found disappointing was that the novel jumped back and forth between the characters a lot and it needed more to the actual haunting of the house...anyway to me at least.

Don't get me wrong a little sex isn't bad.  The main problem I'm having with it is simply Anita, she's all high and mighty when it comes to feeding the ardeur yet when she has to kill she just pulls the trigger, no thinking to it.  Her moral high ground is getting on my nerves and I'm glad to see with this book she lets it down a little and just has some fun with it, although afterwards its a whole chapter of nothing but being pissed that she did it.  I loved the whole Asher/JC/Anita trio. I'm glad to see Asher devolping alittle.  And her episode with Jason was WOW and a long time coming.  Nathenial is finally becoming a MAN and not a whimpy \\"yes dear may I have another\\" boy.  The plot is lacking like, nothing much to it.  The whole book is mainly \\"feed the ardeur, kill something, feed the ardeur\\" which is getting frustrating.  There was this whole Mother of All Darkness bit but didn't last but like 3 chapters, would have wished that had been the man focus of the story b/c that would have made it readable again.  Buy it if you love Anita although its the same plot as the last few, nothing grand is happening. I hope with Incubus Dreams a lot of things change for the sake of Anita herself.  Series is dwindling, pretty darn fast!	2004-09-17

As a whole it was an alright book.  Not one of the better in the series but hey, everyone screws up sometimes, and this was Laurell's.  First I'll have to say this, RICHARD MUST, I MEAN MUST DIE!  I'm really getting tired of him, he's becoming such an a**.  The only highlight of the book was the introduction of Micah, who is filling the loneliness in my heart, although god knows something has to be wrong w/ him to be so understanding.   Enough on that, I would say buy this book simply b/c its part of a series, can't skip a part, although nothing major happens. The main plot of the novel was something of a new take on her character although that dwindles rather quickly and doesn't end how I had wished it to.	2004-09-17
US	23094763	RLDPWZK2P3CR0	055380250X	303170656	The Taking	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Not an average run of the mill horror/thriller novel	This was probably one of the only Dean Koontz books that had me guessing to the very end.  It was very suspensful.  Throughout the novel he keeps the reader guessing as to what exactly is happening to the world around the select group of characters.  About halfway through I thought I had completely figured the story out, but as it turned out the novel took a whole different approach.  I didn't even see it coming.  It was a great read full of surprises and also some pretty gory moments, some of which made my skin crawl.  It still holds true to the horror/thriller theme Koontz is known for but it also has a lot of drama thrown into the mix.  The novel pulls you in and it makes yourself fill like one of the characters trying to get through the obstacles they face.  Highly recommend you checking this book out.	2004-08-18

I'm rather new to the series, I bought the first three novels and read all three within a week, thats how much I liked them.  During the past novels however, I have been drawn to Jean-Claude.  Throughout the novels you can literally feel the sexual tension between Anita and him, with the added bonus of Richard the book makes my heart skip beats.  I usually find romance novels boring but this series has intwined romance and horror so its not so \\"romance\\" driven.  This book has a lot of action, its more plot driven although you can figure it out rather easy, much like most of the novels but its a good fun fast paced read. I would recommend the whole series to anyone a fan of vampires and romance novels.	2004-08-17

I couldn't put the book down, I can't wait to see how the story fully unfolds. Extremely pleased with this book.  One of her best.	2004-08-17
