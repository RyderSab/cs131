JACKDAWS is a good read, especially for those who are sick of &quot;manly men&quot; getting things done. This time the women have a hand in things and that makes this an interesting book.

I finished it in one day! Once again, Chuck Logan immerses the reader in the world of his protagonist,in this case, Phil Broker. Hopefully we'll see more of Broker in future books. This is a great read and the &quot;daddy&quot; scenes are winners. The reviewer who says Broker doesn't care about his wife and child didn't read this book very carefully. What about the last sentence?????  Maybe one has to understand about &quot;compartments&quot; to understand Phil Broker.	2001-07-28

Louis Kincaid is real, and the situations he encountered in 1983 Mississippi were real.  In answer to one reviewer's casting for the movie:  Spacey's okay as the sheriff, but put Crowe as Walter Kelly.  He's capable of being that mean.  I'm looking forward to reading Parrish's follow-up novel and soon.	2001-03-01

GOOD COP, BAD COP certainly brings back memories of  Chicago (I live near) in the turbulent 60's.  I remember well the  Democratic Convention of 1968 and the Fred Hampton raid in 1969.  The  novel's characterization of the Bertolucci brothers is true-to-life, and  the entire scenario is too plausible to be ignored.  Is this historical  fiction?  Probably not in the strictest sense of the word, but it gives the  reader a feel for the ways things were done then and how people can still  suffer in the aftermath, even after 30 years.  A good, fast read.	2000-08-03

I, too, was contacted by the elusive Arlene, and finally I purchased the book.  The story is great and Max and Beast are good characters, but as an English teacher I was consistently thrown off by the horrendous editing job  that was done on this book.  Other reviewers have listed these errors; I  don't have to repeat them here.  It takes away from both the readibility  and the credibility of an otherwise promising author's debut. Voyage Books:   you should be ashamed.  By the way, the 4-star rating is for editing, not  for content. That would earn a 5.	1999-08-04

I hadn't read any of Connelly's  books until this summer and now I can't wait to get to THE CONCRETE BLONDE.

First, the reason Alexis wanted to become pregnant was too far fetched.  Then, as fragile as the pregnancy was supposed to be, Alexis was practically a G.I. Jane with all her heroics.  Also,the relationship with her mother and with Nick were not too believable either. Admittedly I read and read until I finished the book, but I enjoyed DARK ROAD HOME a whole lot more and BLACK ORCHID was terrific.	1998-06-26

I looked forward to AN ISOLATED INCIDENT and for the first 9/10 of the book I was not disappointed.  But just when the book should have gotten REALLY interesting it fizzled into a preview of a sequel.  When the participants of the basement meetings are about to be revealed, the thoughts of the child distract the reader from the novel and make us wonder about a sequel.  And then the last chapter sets the reader up even more for a sequel.  This ending cheated the reader.  Sloan was so good for so long and then the last few pages were a rip-off.  We deserve better!	1998-06-23

I purchased THE DEEP END OF THE OCEAN right after Oprah recommended it, but just got around to reading it last week.  I thought the entire book was too contrived and I had a hard time plowing through it, even though I was determined to finish it to see what happened.  I thought some characters, like Pat, were not sufficiently developed, while others, like Candy, were over-developed.  The character I felt the most empathy for was Vincent, who never had a chance once Ben was taken.  He and Kerry had to make it on their own, and where was spineless Pat?  Anyway, sometimes I read Oprah's choices and sometimes I don't.  This is one time I wish I hadn't.	1998-06-14

After seeing that the reviews of FEAR NOTHING range from 10 all the way down to 1, I feel better about my feelings about the novel.  After reading reviews of it, I thought it would be a &quot;can't stop reading it&quot; kind of book.  Not so.  It took me a while to get started; finally, however, it began to pick up momentum and I finished it fairly quickly.  I didn't get the enjoyment from this novel that I have from some of Koontz's others. Maybe I was expecting too much.  Also, the ending left me hanging;  maybe it's because there are more adventures of Chris, Bobby, Sasha, and Orson to come. Come on, Dean, give us what you used to!	1998-02-15

Danielle Steel is predictable, and usually I just read along, kind of knowing what will happen and accepting it, but this time she has a unique approach.  In THE GHOST, Steel does a double: a modern-day love story entwined with one from the early 1800's.  The result is better than usual; the characters, Charlie and Francesca, Sarah and Francois, are more interesting than Steel's usual  girl gets hurt, girl gets brave, girl gets a new wonderful life characters. I kept reading because the anguish that both Charlie and Francesca had gone through with their respective mates was realistic, plus the abuse that Sarah had gone through with her husband in England made me want to scream. <br /> Steel's two-century story line made this book a better read than she's usually achieved. Like Charlie, I didn't want the journal entries from Sarah to end. <br />  This book took me a day and a half to read, and the day was a school day. <br /> My advice to readers of Danielle Steel is to accept her with her limitations and when a pleasant departure from her usual fluff comes along, as is the case with THE GHOST, just sit back and enjoy!	1997-11-12
