When you look at this amazing historical account of one of the world's greatest events you can only say \\"Thanks\\" to it's author, Laurence Bergreen. Mr. Bergreen brings this journey to life on each page making it an exciting, wonderful read. Magellan was quite a guy, faced with incredible difficulties both econmic and political yet he managed to convince those in power that he was the man to lead this expedition. As those five ships left Spain into the unknown the reader can only wonder how men could survive in such conditions. Never really sure of where they were going, they proceeded on in search of the Spice Islands and the wealth they were sure existed there. Page by page, the reader is taken around the world as if he were on the ships with these men. History can often be dull, but I assure you this book is not and will capture you like nothing else. It is a remarkable, well written and documented story that will keep your interest right up to the final page. This is a must for history lovers!	2005-03-10

If you love stories about the Military, this is a most unusual one as Billy relates his career as a Spedial Forces operator. His stories, from the Viet Nam war to Afganistan, are not what you will read about in the mainstream media. Often times, I had to shake my head when reading this because I could hardly believe a man could be this daring. One close call after another and yet he begged to go back time after time and serve his country. This is a good look at Special Forces operations which are a vital part of protecting our country. Read this book and you'll be glad we have guys out there like Billy Waugh who served for 50 years!	2005-02-28

Jeff Shaara is without a doubt one of the best historical novelists writing today. To the Last Man is a vivid portrayal of World War I through the eyes of those who fought it. As usual, the author is historically accurate and is able to bring to life the battles and  political problems as seen from all those involved, British, French, German and American. The characters are real people who come to life through the writers impression of what they may have thought and done. It's a remarkable story that will captivate you from start to finish.

Fergus Fleming has done a marvelous job of relating tales of British explorers of the early 1800's. Fleming has a knack for telling the story with great wit and you'll often smile as he brings these characters to life. From the Sahara to the Arctic and to the Antarctic and Australia Barrow (Second Secretary of the Admiralty) sends his &quot;boys&quot; in search of glory for the British. Many of these stories have been written about before but bringing them together as Fleming has done, puts this period of exploration in prospective. It was a great time for England even though most of these epics ended in disaster and failed to prove much of what Barrow was looking for.	2004-03-28

The book tells much about those days of trapping and exploring when the West was an unknown and unmapped area. In addition to telling the stories of several individual characters like John Colter, Jim Bridger, Hugh Glass, Jeidiah Smith and others, the author takes time to explain the fur trapping business. There are several sections in the book explaining weapons, traps, boats, clothing, tools, etc. The result is that the reader gets a good insight into what these men did and how they did it. The one drawback might be that some of the character studies are a bit short, often leaving the reader wanting more information. However, for a general overview of an important time in our early history, this is a wonderful book. I'd like to see this as required reading in our schools.	2003-10-28

His writings on Scott, Amundsen and Shackleton are among the very best. It is no less the case in NANSEN In this story of a very unusual, complex and troubled man, Huntford pictures Nansen as he really was, not some trumped up hero of his own making. Nansen was not a great leader of men, nor was he easy to be around. Yet, he had incredible drive and determination in all he did. His scientific research in his early days was ahead of its time and sadly, much of what he accomplished he was never given credit for. When he turned his life to Arctic pursuits, his drive was no less intense, as he perfected the art of Cross country skiing, was the first to cross Greenland and eventually ended up on one of the greatest epics of our time with his quest for the North Pole. Nansen's own account of the North Pole adventure was his book &quot;Farthest North&quot;. Huntford, in his biography, covers this story in depth, drawing from Nansen's diaries as well as those of the other men involved. The result is that we have a deeper insight into what really happened rather than just relying on Nansen's own account. Whatever the case, this adventure was one of the most remarkable of all polar explorations and this alone is worth reading.<br />The story of Nansen's life after this great episode, seems to bog down a bit. Nansen lived off his North Pole quest which made him a household name worldwide. This result was to put him into the political world in a way he never dreamed. Throughout the remainder of his life one has the feeling he really wanted to be exporing again and just get away from people and fame. He was a troubled and often unhappy man. Nonetheless, he certainly deserves his place as the father of Polar Exploration and many of those who followed owe much to him. An interesting story well worth the time.	2003-08-06

Pierre Berton covers almost 100 years of man's effort to discover the Northwest Passage and the North Pole. Although it is a long read (over 600 pages) the author's wonderful storytelling style keeps you eagerly turning page after page. Each account seems to have been well researched and the facts are there for the reader to absorb. It is amazing to read how poorly the British were prepared for Arctic travel, how they refused to learn from the native people, yet how much they achieved in spite of their attitude. This book has a good message for us all. We can learn from others! Those explorers who did so, were a lot more successful in the long run. The book ends with Peary and Cook's claim to the North Pole. It is quite an account of two men who were more consumed with their image rather than the truth. Who was the greatest of the bunch? You'll have fun picking your winner. I vote for Roald Amundsen!  This is a great book!	2003-04-11

Jeff Shaara has such a wonderful way of bringing history alive and he has done it once again with this story of the Revolutionary War. I would almost swear that he followed the characters, taking detailed notes as to what they thought and believed. While many may think he takes license by putting words into the mouths of people such as Washington, Greene, Cornwallis, Franklin and others, it's done in such a way as to bring the historical event to life. I believe his research is accurate and the events are set forth as they happened. By writing in such a style the characters become alive once more and we seem to be right there with them as they endure this difficult time of our history. Additionally, the author makes frequent use of maps throughout his story telling. This is especially helpful as it allows the reader the follow where these battles took place. As an avid reader of history I can think of no other author who brings history to life better than Mr. Shaara. He has a real gift and you'll not be disappointed in his latest work.	2003-01-21

Many Americans today will not admit that our country was founded upon Christian principles as outlined in the Bible. I believe this is because most text books do not address this topic and the current misconception of seperation of Church and State forbides students from studying this part of history. Barton's book is richly documented with original quotes from a variety of men who helped write the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. Additionally, he quotes a number of court cases which clearly show how modern day Supreme Court decisions have changed the intent of our Founding Fathers. Regardless of a person's religious beliefs, the historical foundations of our most important documents need to be discussed, not covered up. Every American should read this book and there is not doubt they'll be better informed as to where we started and where we've gone in the last two hundred years.	2002-12-17

This account of the early days of the Revolutionary War is done in the same vein as his work on the Civil War. He takes the historical characters involved (John Adams, George Washington, Ben Franklin and others) and breathes life into them. Perhaps we'll never know what their actual conversations were like but Shaara's book is as close as we'll ever come. This is a marveleous way to study history.

This is truly a remarkable, in depth look at where the western movement of our country really began. It is difficult for most Americans to realize that the Western frontier was the Ohio River Valley. States like Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana hardly register as the &quot;Wild West&quot; yet the episodes that took place there are much more dramatic than most stories of the far west. Eckert pulls no punches as he tells the stories of both Whites and Indians. Some of the tales are heart breaking and some are terribly gruesome. This is not a book for the faint hearted. If you live in the Ohio River area, you owe it to yourself to find out just what happened there. This is a book well worth your time.	2002-10-19

Michael Smith has done a fine job in tracing Crean's life from his early days in the Navy, his subsequent trips with Scott and Shackleton right up to his final days as a Pub owner is his home in Ireland.

The beauty of this book is that it documents the story with the remarkable photos of the expedition photographer, Australian Frank Hurley. When you consider the time period of this story (1914-1916) you can only marvel that Hurley produced such amazing images with the equipment that was available at that time. Additionally, the initial introduction to this photo collection is excellent. It presents a good recap of the Endurance expedition with many quotes from crewmembers that have not appeared in previous books.If you are a professional photographer, or even an amateur, the information on Hurley's equipment and the story of his early training will be of special interest. The over 500 photos will hold your interest for hours! I've read almost every book on Endurance and this will rank as one of my favorites.	2001-11-16

The direct quotes from the letters give the account an intimate feel which really enables the reader to connect to the private as well as public life of these people. Additionally, McCullough's description of Adams encounters with Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, Hamilton and others offers great insight into early political relationships of our Founding Fathers. It was not all smooth going and the author is fair in relating the shortcomings as well as the successes of those who brought our country to birth. Adams role was extremely important, yet history has never given him the place he so richly deserves.

If you are a fan of Arctic or Antarctic exploration, then this book is a must read for you. As in the Endurance epic of Ernest Shackleton in Antarctica, Albanov's ship was also locked in the ice only in the far reaches of the Arctic near Franz Josef Land. Albanov and a few others decide to leave the ship and make their way over the ice to the safety of land many miles away. This account documents their efforts as they encounter one hardship after another. I have been to this part of the world and having seen it first hand, it is almost impossible for me to imagine how they survived. It is interesting to compare this story with that of the Shackleton adventure. Both took place at about the same time in history, yet at opposite Poles. The main contrast I noted was the superior leadership qualities of Shackleton. While Albanov did not measure up to that standard, he, nonetheless, with great difficulty seemed to keep his men going. Unfortunately, he did not have the success of Shackleton. This book is a good addition to any library on Polar adventure stories.	2001-01-05

The brief accounts are, for the most part, lifted from the journals and stories written by the person involved. While it opened the door to many names and perilous tales I had never before read about, the book was somewhat of a disappointment. I found many of the narratives too short and clipped to really give a good picture of what was involved. Several of the stories were about similar incidents (mountain climbing, sailing, etc.) and I think it would have been more effective to have limited the number and expand a bit on the remaining ones. What this book will do, I believe, is to give the reader the incentive to pursue those epics which are of special interest to him or her, and seek to obtain the full account. If this book succeeds in doing that, then it's well worth your time.	2000-12-24

While this book does not match Lonesome Dove, it shows that he still has what it takes when it comes to a story about the old West. He can take simple situations and weave an interesting story with characters you can't help but fully visualize in your mind. My main complaint is that the story was too short. I think he could have gone deeper into the lives of many of the family members. Nonetheless, when you finish this book you'll have met  a really unusual bunch of people. If you like McMurtry, I'm sure you'll enjoy this one.	2000-11-15

It only proves to me that he is an exceptionally fine author to be able to write a beautifully captivating tale so totally different from his other fine works.One can easily tell from his writing that this subject matter is very close to his heart as he unfolds the tale of this unique family of rural Virginia. At times, I found the story almost too simplistic, yet that uncomplicated style gave it a warm feeling as one became absorbed in the episodes of the family. This is the kind of book you'll finish and feel good about having read it. Loveable characters, family values, morals and good insight into the lives of people who call this area home. It is so very refreshing to read such a story!	2000-11-09

It is a great tribute to those who came so many years before Shackleton, Scott and others into this completely unknown part of our world. The accounts are vivid and often times humorous, in spite of the incredible hardships these men endured. Although this might be considered difficult subject matter, the author does a great job of telling each story of adventure in a compelling and griping manner. We owe much to these men for their leadership, courage and vision. The account of Captain Cook is particularly good. What a great leader! This is a good addition for all you arm-chair explorers.	2000-10-21

The biggest complaint is that the story was so repetitive. The same facts, over and over. In chapter after chapter, he remarks on the number of rails laid, the number of spikes driven, the number of fills made, the tunnels dug, and so on. I think much more life would have been given to the story if more personal accounts and incidents of the workers had been expanded upon. No doubt it was a great undertaking, but more should have been written about the common man doing the work. Additionally, more maps and photos should have been included which would have given the reader a better view than just the endless list of facts and figures. Ambrose really missed it on this one.	2000-10-21

So much of the Lewis and Clark epic centers upon the exploits of the two leaders that it is refreshing to find an account from another point  of view. And, that's exactly what happens here as Thom tells the story as  Drouillard sees it. Although Drouillard was an illiterate half-breed who  was unable to write personal journals, he is mentioned often in the  journals of both Lewis and Clark. From that alone, we get a picture of an  extremely capable individual who often went far beyond what was expected of  him. The success of the expedition owed much to Drouillard's efforts.  Thom's account relies heavily upon the published journals of Lewis and  Clark for accuracy in telling the story. The one thing which may bother  some readers is that much of Drouillard's story is based upon Thom's own  imagination as to what Drouillard thought and felt. However, any novelist  in a similar situation would have to do the same thing. In this case, there  is no better man than Thom to fill in the blanks. His past books and  extensive research into this part of our history gives him great  credibility. Sign Talker is a great story and well worth your time to read.	2000-08-01
US	52266428	R2B02LEEB132WT	0553111337	243328997	Flags of Our Fathers	Books	5	4	5	N	Y	RELUCTANT HEROS	I remember when I was a twelve year old boy and saw the famous picture of the American flag being raised on Iwo Jima. It had such an incredible impact on every American. Now, 55 years later, that flag raising and the  men involved has come to life again in a most dramatic way through James  Bradley's well researched story. This book should be read by every  American. While so many stories of war tend to emphasize the heroics,  Bradley's account relates the lives of these men in a manner which I am  sure they would approve. They were men doing their duty, protecting each  other and waging a battle against an enemy intent upon killing every  Marine. None of them sought the heroic image nor wanted anything more than  for them and their buddies to survive. The flag raising, in their eyes, was  no big thing.  Additionally, the insight Bradley gives into each mans early  life and family, touching on their faith and values, allows the reader to  see these men as they really were...common, everyday American boys. The  battle accounts are grizzly and vivid. It is hard to visualize what these  boys actually endured. This story takes you there and cannot help but make  you proud to be an American. In spite of the fact that Bradley's father was  one of the six, his account of each man's life is fair, accurate and  uplifting. Truly, this is one of the best war stories of our time.	2000-07-15

The epic of Endurance has been given the most publicity but this story is every bit as captivating. These men, who had the responsibility to place food and  supply depots for Shackleton's intended journey across Antarctica, endured  hardship beyond description.  They were totally dedicated to their task and  their devotion to Shackleton is heartwarming. It proves, once again, his  leadership prevailed even though he was almost 2,000 miles away from them.  The writer gives a good insight into each of the characters and, as you  read, you will feel you are enduring the journey yourself. It is without a  doubt, one of the greatest stories of survival and a tribute to the  toughness of the human spirit to prevail.	2000-04-20

His stories are always interesting and fast paced but this one was far too wordy, too long and the ending was a real let-down. 673 pages of chasing a  terrorist with no resolution at the end. Additionally, I am getting a bit  fed-up with his abundant use of the &quot;F&quot; word. It adds nothing to  the story or the characters. It was excessive in his novel &quot;The  Generals Daughter&quot; and was even more so in this one. I can understand  occassional profanity to make a character life-like, but he went overboard  this time. It cheapens the story. Grisham doesn't do it and neither does  Clancy. Both write great stories. DeMille should take a lesson from them.	2000-03-10

However, on this one, I think he was not up to par. I could never really understand where he was going with this one. The story  seemed to take you in a certain direction, then just drop you. The ending  did not pull things together, nor did it make some kind of statement. I got  the feeling at the end of this story that nothing had been resolved in the  characters lives and we are just kind of left wondering what it was all  about. Far from his best, but still better than many other authors.	2000-02-15

It is a well written, in depth story of a remarkable experience in the far arctic north. Very few people have ever experienced such an epic and if they have,  few have ever written about it in such vivid terms. This story allows the  reader to live it vicariously through Alvah Simons detailed account. It  ranks right up there with &quot;Endurance&quot; as one of my favorite tales  of survival. A great read!	1999-12-09

This story rambled too much. Boring. Also, in this story he seems to relate to foul language in excess of his  other books. Why do so many authors seem to feel they must include an  abundance of four letter foul words? Please, David, go back to your old  style.	1999-11-20

I believe the author is living on the laurels of Angela's Ashes. The story is a rambling, foul, vulgar discourse on what appears to be many imagined stories. McCourt admits in  interviews he did not keep any diaries or notes. I find it difficult that  he remembered all this in such detail. The sad thing is that it appears he  turned out no better than his drunken father. I had hoped his life would be  more of a shining example to other immigrants who strive for the American  dream. It seems his only intention in this book was to see how much garbage  the reader would tolerate. I would not recommend this book to anyone. Save  your money!	1999-11-16
