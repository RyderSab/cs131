I have all her books and have yet to find any that I truely did not like. The Raven was a really good historical romance that painted great pictures of the past. The characters were perfect even with their flaws. Roger is the perfect mate for Roseanna because of his willingness to be patient. Roseanna has moments of youthful temperment which would bring the most sane to his knees at times. Of course, there are spats and making up and then you have the love peeking out SLOWLY but surely. :)	2002-04-25

It was extreamly well written and all the \\"flavors\\" of the book came through wonderfully. Adam and Flora were the perfect couple! They both knew what they wanted out of live and were definatly not afraid to grab life by the tail. Flora, being wealthy in her own right and SINGLE!, knew how to be independant yet sophisticated and she was not afraid to let her sexuality out to play. Adam, the half breed Comte de Chastellux, was her equal in almost every way. From almost the beginning of their relationship he began having jealous thoughts concerning her sex life but, of course, that just added to his appeal. The love affair that took place in this book seemed so real that the reader could actually see it happening. <br />Great Book, SJ! I have every SJ book there is to be had and this is by far one of my favorites!	2002-04-25

It is mainly about Anita and Edward together instead of Anita with her \\"boys\\".<br />In OB, Anita heads to Santa Fe to fulfill her commitment to Edward (from a previous book). While there, she has to deal with a mixture of Aztec rituals performed by werejaguars and skinned or mutilated humans. Edward is completly lost as to what or whom is doing all this so he calls Anita and two others in to help. On top of all this, Anita is having to deal with the \\"new\\" Edward who turns out to be engaged to a woman who has kids and that makes her think about her own relationships. Also, Anita is shown to be doing a bit more soul searching in this book concerning her \\"new powers\\" and how they are going to affect her life. <br />We are introduced to a few new characters, one of which we are likely to see again, namely Bernardo and Olaf. They were the other two \\"friends\\" of Edwards who were brought in to help solve the mystery behind the deaths. <br />This book was a little different from the ones that came before it in the fact that Anita gets her butt kicked a bit more than normal. That, alone, added a nice twist to the story.<br />I dont think I would say this was my favorite but it is up there. It didnt really focus everything on Anita so it was a bit different than the first 8 books. But I would definatly recommend it!	2002-04-16

This book started out with a school teacher, Shannon Parker, going to an auction and finding, then buying, an item that caught her eye. This item is responsible for her being pulled into an alternate world/universe and taking the place of Rhiannon, a goddess. Shannon is beyond confused at first only to find out that she is getting married immediately to someone she has never met before. When she finally meets this \\"man\\" is surprised, to say the least. Everything works out for them though and it turns out to be a perfect match. Of course you have a little trouble mixed into all that happiness... :)<br />I would have to say that this book had it all. A little romance, mystery, sci-fi, myth..everything.

I bought this book because of Christine Feehan but was pleasently surprised with 3 out of 4 of the stories. <br />Since Ms. Feehan is a favorite author of mine, I will start with her! :) If you have read any of her previous books, you should be familiar with her Carpathians. This novella is a bit different whereas we are in the jungle, in Borneo, and we are dealing with wereanimals. Mmmm! Here we are introduced to Maggie Odessa while she is on her way into the deep jungle to claim her inherited properties from her biological parents (she was adopted). While there she learns a little secret that changes her life forever and along the way meets a man.... :) Yummy!<br />My next favorite would have to be Elda Minger's story about a female reporter who goes undercover to get a story about an all male seminar concerning seduction. While doing this, she is introduced to the bachelor of her dreams but is forced to continue her role as a man...for a while that is. <br />After that it would have to be Sabrina Jeffries' story about a young beautiful widow who heads a council at an all boys school. She and a rivel always bicker about what is best for the school. Things finally come to a head and the council has to choose between either her plan or her rivals plan concerning a factory at the school. This throws her into a &quot;mood&quot; and her friend, who is also on the council, attempts to help her experience a little JOY in life. The friend offers to take Isobel to a Widows Auction where women are &quot;sold&quot; to the highest bidder for a night of passion. Her rival, Lord Justin, just happens to be there and wins her for the night. He tries to be a gentleman about it but we all know they were just PRETENDING to be rivals.....right?<br />My least favorite was definatly Emma Hollys story about a woman named Luisa who travels to the far off land of Tibet to find out if the monks can cure her of her need for blood. While at the temple, she meets a monk who is about to make his final vows and finds something that she has been without her whole life. But will he give in to her or follow through with his vows..?<br />It was definatly a great book. Every anthology has its weak point and its strong point for each individual reader. If any of the authors in this book is a favorite then you definatly need to read it!	2002-04-16

I made the mistake of reading all of the Sky O'Malley books before this one and nothing can really compare to that series.<br />This book is about a young woman who has learned to live outside the glowing rays of family love. One of her grandfathers wifes hates her with a passion and does whatever she can to hurt or humiliate Cailin. When a Saxon named Wulf Ironfist comes to thier castle Cailin is given to him for the evening even though she is a virgin. Things happen that night and they decide to get married. What happens after that is an interesting story of her surival among slavers and other such people. <br />If you get emotional reading survival stories, this would be a little bit of a tear jerker.	2002-04-03

This was definatly not my favorite Anita Blake book. Im not sure what it was but it just didnt do much for me or add much to the aura surrounding Anita and the people surrounding her.<br />This book picks up with Anita reinstating herself after a 6 month hiatus. She is planning on choosing between Jean-Claude and Richard but everything, as usual, goes wrong. First some of her pard is kidnapped and she calls in her boyfriends. Before they go in to rescue her \\"family members\\", Jean-Claude and Richard marry the vamp marks so that the power is shared between them all. Something goes wrong and a huge fight breaks out where Anita is almost killed and is severly scratched by one of her pard members while he was trying to protect her. Richard, being the type of person he is, finds out about this and jumps to the conclution that the clawing was on purpose so he captures Gregory, the were leopard, to punish/kill him for possibly convreting Anite (which means she can no longer be lupa to him). Anita is now forced to go against her friends and ex-lover to gain back one of her pard.<br />After the marrying of the marks, Anita begins to notice differences in herself that causes her to become very uncomfortable. She gains an inner beast from Richard and Ardeur from Jean-Claude, which is basically the ability to feed off sex and blood. She battles with this throughout the rest of the book along with the moral dilema that craving sex or blood from strangers causes her.<br />Micah, an attractive wereleopard king, is introduced to us in this book. He immediatly falls for Anita and tells her that the need she feels around him is meant to be considering she is his equal in the pard. I, personally, did not care for Micah much. He seemed to roll over for Anita too much. He will get on her nerves soon enough when she realizes that he relies on her judgement in an extream way. Because of the attraction that is seen between Micah and Anita, Richard all but gives up on her and in the end he cant live with the possibility of her being a monster like himself. He cant accept the beast within himself so he knows he cant love Anita when she has the same \\"affliction\\". He would be perfect for her if he would just suck it up and be a man.<br />Overall, I would say its a pretty good book. It has its good parts and its weak parts. There isnt TONS of sex like I thought there was going to be after reading some of the reviews. There was a bit more intimate moments as Anita was trying to conquer the Ardeur.<br />Ya know, there are times where I wish she would just go with Asher. Hes strong and ancient and accepts her for who she is.  *shrug* If she doesnt want him.. Ill take him! :)	2002-04-03

The best though is the fact that Anita comes into her own. She is thrown into horrible situations and always found herself on top without feeling like she rules the world. She really begins to understand just what exactly she is and that scares her. Jean-Claude puts a name to her madness, necromancer. Other than that great revelation, she is in the process of figuring out what exactly is out there eating people and why. She tries to get a powerful voodoo priestess, Dominga Salvador, to help her but instead Anita is asked to help with something that goes against every moral fiber in her body. When she refuses to help Dominga that throws her onto yet another \\"hate list\\".<br />Oh..and of course Jean-Claude is STILL trying to get into her pants and mind.

She has introduced us to new characters that bring out more of Anitas personality and we see Anita thrown into a \\"mothering\\" role which is new to her. For most of the book, Anita finds herself acting as lupa to the werewolf pack since Richard is away. They are no longer dating but she is still lupa until she is replaced by Richard. She is also needed as protector of the wereleopards since she killed thier leader in another book. Anita is having to learn to deal with her personal life with Jean-Claude, the Master Vamp of the city and her boyfriend, and the question and comments that friends are making about the pair.<br />In the middle of everything, Jean-Claude's home is overrun with council members from the Vampire Council which \\"governs\\" vamps worldwide. They think Jean-Claude is a threat to the council since he was able to kill one of the more powerful council members (from an earler book). Anita tries to help and finally wises up towards them and starts to turn the members \\"games\\" against them. How does she do it?! <br />In this book we learn more about certain were animals that we have been seeing in other books. It makes those characters more loveable and/or likeable.	2002-04-02

I REALLY loved a Kiss of Shadows, the first book of this series. This book, though, left a little to be desired. LKH does unique sex scenes and provides great interaction between the characters and I think those points are what saved this book. <br />A Caress picks up where Kiss left off. Merry is half way secure about her surroundings now but surprises keep popping up. Her new found responsiblities are causing her to mature into a better and stronger character which is great considering what she will be going against later on in her life. One thing I wish that had been more in depth was the duty vs. love situation that she was finding herself in but maybe that will be covered well in the next book. <br />I would have given more stars had I not finished reading the book wondering what I had missed. I felt like I had skipped half the book and was left feeling half \\"involved\\" with the characters. Im the type of reader who loves to burrow into the characters head and feel and see everything along with her. It just didnt happen with this book.

She brings with her an assortment of vamps and were, some of which were sent by Jean-Claude, because of a threat by the local master vamp of the city. Anita is still providing protection to those with her as Lupa and Nimir-ra and alot of the book focuses on that fact. Anita learns exactly what it means to be lupa when she is possessed by the munin of a past lupa who hated Anita. She is now having to learn to battle and control the munin before it distroys her.

Once again Ms. Feehan has come through with a book that yanks a reader into the story. One can see the horror and feel the pain that the hunters cause Jacques. One can also feel the desperation of Shea as she runs away from those hunting her and runs to the Carpathian mountains where he father is from. Her horror at the fact that her \\"nightmares\\" had been real ripples through us as we go with her and find Jacques mutilated and raging with hatred.<br />This book was different from those before it because of the fact that the Jacques mind was shattered and he was practically crossing over when his lifemate found him. He was out of control and abused Shea many times before he realized who she was and what he was doing. When he felt threatened by his brother, Mikhair from \\"Dark Prince\\", he did the unthinkable and bit her savagely. It took him a long time to understand who was his friend and that he could trust someone other than Shea. Shea, of course, is battling her own demons in which she is trying to solve the mystery behind her weird blood disorder. Everything falls into place as she discovers that she is truely half human and half carpathian.<br />This book was a wonderful continuation of the Carpathian series.

Sure it was dark, setting that is, but it wasnt gotic. BUT that does not take away from the story!<br />In Ms. Feehan's story, Dillon Wentworth is disfigured and reclusive. His children are left in Jessica Fitzpatrick's care since his wife was killed in the fire that disfigured him. When Jessica returns before Christmas with the children, she is visited by nightmares of what happened to her the last time she lived in that house. She also comes to realize that her attraction to Dillon is returned. One word for this story..YUMMY. Dillon being disfigured took nothing away from his silent sex appeal and Jessica jumped right on in!<br />In Ms. George's story, Rachel Hudson goes on a trip visit the Scottish castle where her deceased parents met. While there she has the \\"pleasure\\" of falling for a scottish warrior that is swept into the present from the past. Along with him, though, comes a force that is out to kill. This story was good although it had a tear jerker of an ending. All ends well though! :)	2002-03-15

Ms. Adair has it all in her books \\"Kiss and Tell\\" and \\"Hide and Seek\\". Her books are extremely well-written with strong characters and steamy sex scenes. Alpha males run loose these two books and it provides a great basis for a good read.<br />In \\"Hide and Seek\\", a T-FLAC member and a kindergarden teacher are thrown together..both working undercover for different reasons. Four years ago, as virtual strangers, they had a 72 hour affair that left her emotionally scarred and him with wonderful dreams. They meet each other by accident at the house of an internationally wanted man and the lust/love is rekindled.<br />These books have the perfect blend of violence and sensuality.	2002-03-15

After reading the four books that lead up to \\"Dark Magic\\" I was hoping for something a little better. Although it was a really good book I felt something was missing. I dont know if it was because of Savannah taking advantage of Gregori's willingness to give her a little space or what.<br />Ms. Feehan does do a good job at drawing the reader into the story once again though. One can feel the torment that Gregori went through while waiting so long for a lifemate and when she finally appeared he didnt know if it was his doing or fate. He was troubled over what he had done while Raven, \\"Dark Prince\\", was pregnant and was afraid that he had taken another Carpathians lifemate away from them. He was so close to turning that he became desperate. Savannah, Mikhail and Ravens daughter, seemed a bit head strong and childish until the book was almost over. At 18, when most lifemates meet and mate, she wanted to see the world and not submit to her lifemate. When she met Gregori she knew that he was the one and that scared her since he was so much older and considered a monster by other Carpathians. But Gregori, being out of character for his lifemate, chose to allow her 5 years of freedom and that nearly cost him everything. Savannah jumped at the chance and moved to America to become a top notch magician who was known world round. When Gregori finally claimed her, he was so close to the edge that the beast in him all but killed her. Guilt from that act along with the lingering thoughts of stealing her from her true lifemate racks him. Savannah is then left with the duty to prove him wrong. When life turned good, she taught him how to live again.<br />Its a keeper but it could have been better.	2002-03-15

This book, though, didnt agree with me. Dont get me wrong, the imagery in the book was great but the vibe just wasnt there for me. Julian was a strong character and so was Desari but a story about them meeting one moment then falling for each other the next without any action just didnt paint a picture worth reading about for me. I did read the whole book and I was disappointed that Feehan did not bring Gregori into play since Desari and Darius were his long lost siblings. *sigh* In the long run, I think if one read just this book alone it would be alot better but since it followed four other books that rocked my world...this one just came up...two stars short of a bunch.	2002-03-15
