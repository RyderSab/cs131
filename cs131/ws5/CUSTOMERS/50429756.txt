The 'Naskh' script is not used by Arabs in handwriting and attempts to imitate it only end up looking amateurish. <br /> <br />Mitchell's book is the only really good introduction into both the handwritten and calligraphic 'Ruq'ah' scripts that I know of.  It has a very systematic approach, and comprehensive and thorough coverage which makes it relatively easy to locate specific details-- but since the individual sections are interdependent the student will have to work iteratively through the material front-to-back a number of times until it is completely mastered. <br /> <br />As alluded to in a number of reviews, this book is definitely 'old school'.  It is a reproduction of a typewritten and handwritten manuscript, has a pretty high 'information density' (so the book itself is correspondigly deceptively small), and is unforgiving in its use of technical terminology, demanding focused attention from the reader. <br /> <br />Just to reiterate a point made by another reviewer, this book bears no relationship to Alif Baa at all.  Alif Baa is a grammar tutorial that does not go into handwriting at all-- and vice versa, Mitchell's book presupposes quite some basic knowledge of Arabic orthography.  In any case I'm surprised that someone would recommend Alif Baa under any circumstances, as that suffers, in my opinion, from a great many defects. <br /> <br />If you are used to modern typeset textbooks with four-color graphics, sidebars, and elaborate formatting, you may be disappointed by 'Writing Arabic'.  If, however, you can take this book on its own terms, you should find it a valuable and reliable resource.	2005-06-03
US	50429756	R2NELTD3WHNYDV	189355497X	944466358	Anti Chomsky Reader	Books	5	33	75	N	N	Points of Similarity	It's interesting how much we take on faith. It's common knowledge among us laymen that Noam Chomsky, though revolutionizing the field of linguistics, is just another left-wing kook and self-hating American Jew. The Anti-Chomsky Reader, however, makes a compelling case for the radical view that Noam Chomsky is in fact another left-wing kook and self-hating American Jew, but with all the scholarship of a Michael Moore rant or Rage Against the Machine tirade: even his linguistics seems to be built on the same foundation of intellectual dishonesty and lack of common sense. <br /> <br />Central to the Chomskian worldview is the ineluctable culpability and ultimate evil of the First World, premised on moral hyperrelativism and a total inversion of causality. Any benevolent act of ours can be motivated only by greed and self-interest, while any atrocity commited by one of the fashionable tyrannies is ignored, minimized, or excused as a justified response to our aggression. <br /> <br />Therefore, Cuba is an oppressive dictatorship because of our trade embargo, Vietnam remains underdeveloped because of our war, the Soviet Union failed because its leadership colluded with us to sully the communist ideal, we supported the Nicaraguan contras to deny them a socialist paradise, the killing fields of Cambodia didn't really happen (and as far as it did it was for their own benefit), the rape of Lebanon by the PLO was the Jews' fault after all, Al Qaeda attacked us but we deserved it, and in any case they're not all that bad-- didn't bin Laden build roads in the Sudan? Part of the appeal of Chomskian politics must be that it's so gosh darned simple. <br /> <br />Another aspect is his disdain for the unwashed public, utterly under the spell of a pervasive \\"propaganda system\\" by which Big Corporations blind us from the truth-- never mind that he has managed quite successfully to propagate his own blather. He apparently believes that such publications as the New York Times are part ofthis right-wing propaganda. Chomsky of course has managed to step out into the light and see the shadows on the wall of the cave. <br /> <br />That contempt extends to the elected leaders of the countries he professes to care about-- witness the disdain for Czech president Vaclav Havel who addressed Congress to thank the United States for liberating his country from the communist yoke. Similarly the Left sneered at Hamid Karzai, the president of newly liberated Afghanistan. It seems we simply can do no good. <br /> <br />Readers might not yet be familiar with Chomsky's collaboration with Holocaust deniers. He refuses to dissociate himself from neo-Nazi publications that use his writings, and publishes his books with a French neo-Nazi publisher. He supports Nazi hate speech (in the interest of free speech, of course) but won't extend the same privilege to Jews. <br /> <br />John Williamson's closing account on his linguistics is delicious icing on the cake-- the final nail that deftly punctures his inflated persona and exposes him as a cowering buffoon. <br /> <br />Ann Coulter has said that when a liberal accuses you of something, they're very often guilty of it themselves-- and indeed, Chomsky and his fellow travelers are hard at work constructing their own \\"propaganda system\\" out of self-hatred and self-imposed weakness. The problem, of course, is that propaganda works-- and that is why, for instance, Holocaust deniers are so pernicious. When the lie is unopposed, it will eventually become truth and impossible to refute. But while Chomsky is fighting for mindshare by attempting to further radicalize the Old Media, the battle is fought more and more in the free media marketplace where cable, talk radio, and the Internet now provide space for progressive right-wing voices. <br /> <br />So, rather than a towering intellectual Chomsky is just another stormtrooper of the Left, infatuated with his own rants and daisy chains of self-referential footnotes. It's hard to understand why the Left would pick an expert in linguistics as a most respected exponent of its politics, unless the Left cares less about molding its views to the Truth than molding the truth to its views. Although I don't accuse Chomsky of being a Nazi, I see \\"points of similarity\\" with Goebbels.	2005-01-17

Many Americans sought a rationale for 'why they hate us' in primary sources and found no answers there, and Daniel Pipes has said more or less that reading the Qur'an is probably the worst way to learn about Islam. Similarly, to understand how the Muslim and Arab world sees the West, one needs to draw on its history, or at least, its common experience of history. The Crisis of Islam takes such a pragmatic approach.    An essential and often underappreciated aspect of Islam is its relationship between religion and state. While Christianity has a built-in separation between the two, for Muslims religion is the state. The great conquests made in Europe during the Dark Ages were a vindication of the truth of Islam itself, and for centuries it seemed as if the sky was the limit. Indeed, jihad by the 'House of Islam' (Muslim lands) on the 'House of War' (the rest of the world) is an imperative for Muslims.    But this built-in expansionism has a catch: land that becomes Muslim may never be lost, just as any person who ever accepts Islam strays from it only on penalty of death. While it was bad enough that Christianity recaptured Europe in the 16th century, the defeat of the Ottoman empire in 1918 (the last of the caliphates lasting through thirteen centuries) was an unmitigated disaster. The mere presence of foreigners on holy land is an unbearable humiliation and a constant reminder of the failure, not just of the Muslim state, but of Islam itself.    In the 20th century, the Arab world tried to regain some of its standing by playing off the European imperial powers against each other. First allying itself with Nazism and then Communism, they had a knack of betting on the wrong horse-- the collapse of the Soviet Union must finally have been the last straw for many disenchanted Muslims, the culmination of an intolerable growing cognitive dissonance between the deep natural truth of Islam and its all too publically visible failure. What was going wrong?    While some Muslims realized that their only real future lay in modernization, they faced an uphill battle. The whole of Saudi Arabia has as many universities as Israel built for just the Palestinians, and that in any case churn out mainly degrees in Islamic studies. The entire Arab world has translated in its entire history as many foreign books as Spain does in one year.    Radical Islam provided a different answer-- that rather than being too much steeped in religion, Allah was showing his displeasure because Muslims were just not religious enough. They embarked on a campaign to intimidate people into submission and to assassinate leaders they accused of apostasy. Then, the almost comical delusion that the mujahedeen in Afghanistan single-handedly brought down the mighty Soviet Union provided the confirmation that Allah favored them-- and belief that it was similarly in their power to destroy the one remaining impediment to renewed Islamic world domination: the United States.    Interestingly, America wasn't even on most Arabs' radar screen until the late 20th century. When the radical Islamists finally looked, they were shocked by our freedom of religious, political, and sexual expression.    It's useless to point out to radical Muslims that their interpretation of Islam is not supported by the Qur'an, because the success of their actions proves to them the truth of their beliefs. It's useless to point out that the United States has no territorial ambitions when Islam itself is predicated on imperialism. It's useless to point out that we represent freedom, because to radical Islam, freedom is tantamount to apostasy.    Radical Islam offers the promise of renewed Muslim glory and a vindication of eternal truths. As long as it is seen to be effective it can only further radicalize Muslims. We have to prove them wrong.	2004-11-18

Many did escape a merciful quick death, or the obscenity of choosing between a hundred-story fall or being burned alive, and incurred only horrific injury. And by the grace of God many escaped with even the skin on their backs. Of course, two thousand seven hundred and fifty-two did not. <br /> <br />To some people, though, all this is just an abstraction-- something Michael Moore said we are making too big a deal of. But under the leadership of President Bush, America set out to ensure we would never again endure another 9/11. While the Administration never claimed a direct link between that specific attack and the tyrannical regime of Saddam Hussein, Iraq had many connections to Al Qaeda, was an active supporter of terrorism, a perpetrator of genocide, sought out WMD, had programs to develop WMD, and was believed practically unanimously to possess WMD. Even discounting Iraq's relation to terrorism, Saddam's human rights abuses alone should have been more than enough for any freedom-loving society to be happy to be rid of him. <br /> <br />If it was no surprise that countries hostile to us weren't happy we chose to undertake that task, having some of our supposed friends and allies turn their backs on us was disappointing and disheartening. Gibson provides a useful contribution by not lumping them all together but providing a case-by-case analysis of why individual countries or societies might have been unwilling to support us. <br /> <br />A special place is reserved for France. While some countries voiced their disagreement with our plans by simply not participating in them, France fought tooth and nail and actively lobbied anyone who would listen to obstruct us. Being naturally entitled to power by sheer cultural supremacy, France appears decades ago to have forsaken attaining it the old-fashioned way --earning it-- but by positioning itself as the new counterpole to America by reflexively obstructing us at every turn. Former French president Mitterand even declared that \\"we are at war with America.\\" Part of that strategy included helping Saddam build his weapons programs and abuse the UN's oil-for-food program. <br /> <br />Anti-Americanism has existed in the world community of liberal elitists for a long time and certainly didn't spontaneously spring forth as an indignant reaction to our decision to topple Saddam-- but we have for a long time graciously ignored it. <br /> <br />Although examples given illustrate the point, I wish Gibson had more clearly emphasized that even in the most virulent of the offending countries anti-Americanism is by no means universal. I'm not even sure that it constitutes a majority view in many places. Similarly, he forgets the strong undercurrent of anti-Americanism at home. But while just as the election here showed that the America-haters are merely a very vocal and militant minority with a megaphone from the Left media, there are people in those other countries as well who understand that America, not the UN, is \\"the world's last, best hope for peace.\\" We are not imperialists and even in Iraq have made no ambitions for territory or spoils. <br /> <br />On September 11, nineteen souls rotten to the core from envy, lust for death, and the purest hate took the marvel of flight, a gift from America to the world, and converted it to an instrument of terror. They launched at our heart in the insane expectation of crushing it, but instead awakened our fervor to eradicate the scourge. There may be some who don't approve of this, but in Gibson's words: \\"They're wrong. We're right. Get used to it.\\"	2004-11-13
US	50429756	R1XUNFZNY0S2G1	0060736682	254771706	Rewriting History	Books	5	42	49	N	N	Marketing HILLARY	Even though I keep coming back to Morris for his cunning political insight, I've for some reason or other never given his books an unqualified recommendation. No such reservations here. Rewriting History is well written, thoroughly researched, deeply interesting, precise, fair, and above all a lucid exploration of Hillary's personality and decades-long political evolution under her husband's tutelage, that will clear the haze for those who have been mystified by the motiviation of the Clintons. <br /> <br />This is not an insider-tells-all book in the traditional sense. There are few juicy tidbits here that haven't already been widely relished elsewhere. Rather, the book was written as a reaction to the persona Hillary constructed and that was recently buttressed by her autobiography, Living History. Her cultivation of this persona is so complete and calculated that to distinguish it from the real Hillary he calls it the HILLARY brand. <br /> <br />Based on his decades-long intimate experience working with the Clintons, Morris contributes an indispensible insight into someone who is, in some circles, seriously considered a potential future candidate for the presidency. Morris does not fall into the trap of treating Hillary as a clone of Bill, but drawing on comparisons with past presidents, he expounds both their strengths and weaknessess, and one of the great assets of this book is the honest and straightforward way he addresses both. <br /> <br />Hillary is passionate, uncompromising, incredibly disciplined, and manages with an iron rule that tolerates no dissent or disloyalty. Her ideology is rooted in early connections with ultra-Left wing causes, and she takes any disagreement with those preconceptions very personally. Not an intellectual herself, she is easily led by left-wing radicals. Asked once by Morris for a character flaw that could be used to soften her too-perfect public persona, she replied that she \\"[couldn't] think of anything.\\" Like Ronald Reagan and George W Bush, she has a strong sense of good and evil in the world, but unlike them includes a very great many Americans in the 'evil' category. <br /> <br />Steeped in self-righteousness, she will employ absolutely any means to meet her ends. She illegally kept secret the meetings of her health care task force, used confidential FBI files and employed private detectives and physical intimidation to prevent Bill's many affairs from becoming public. She cold-bloodedly fired and smeared the White House travel office staff and denied credit to the ghostwriter of It Takes a Village. Unfortunately, the shield of motherhood and domesticity she hides behind whenever her actions are scrutinized would be unavailable to her as president. <br /> <br />Her deep sense of entitlement leads her to be mired in continual scandal, including (but not limited to) the Whitewater deal, Castle Grande/IDT, and her cattle futures trading. She had no qualms about using the resources of the White House for her personal Senate campaign, including pardons of fraudsters, drug dealers, and terrorists-- all in return for donations and votes. She brazenly solicited gifts from wealthy donors, including, of course the unheard-of $8 million advance on her book, right up until the minute she began her term as senator. <br /> <br />Her yearning to be interesting yields some comical untruths. She claimed to have been named after mountain-climber Edmund Hillary (unknown until five years after her birth), made up a story about her daughter nearly being killed on 9/11 (Chelsea was nowhere near the WTC), and spun a tale about discrimination while playing high-school soccer (her school didn't offer that sport). The obsessive name-dropping seems designed to lend herself importance by association. She feigns love for New York, a state she knew nothing about. <br /> <br />On the one hand, HILLARY overplays her role in welfare reform and international politics just as she downplays her work for American Communist party lawyers and the Black Panthers. She denies any culpability in the Hillarycare fiasco. She denies that her husband's position played any role at all in her own success, even though she was herself at best a mediocre lawyer and politician. <br /> <br />HILLARY is a political brand calculated to appeal to her customer base, but offers no clarity about what kind of president Hillary would be. She takes credit for others' work and blames others for her failures. Morris concludes that a HILLARY presidency, characterized by paranoia and vindictiveness, would most closely resemble that of Nixon. Ironically, Hillary may finally have become what she detested most.	2004-10-21
US	50429756	RE5TMN3SEDGQB	1893554856	45375245	Anti Americanism	Books	4	41	47	N	Y	A Principle of Powerlessness	&quot;One mystery of anti-Americanism is not the disinformation [...] but people's willingness to be disinformed.&quot; So observes Jean-Francois Revel, a student of the United States in the vein of de Tocqueville, and sharing with him the experience of actually having visited America. Just this fact distinguishes him from many of his compatriots who have taken to ritual denunciation of anything and everything American without any intelligent or consistent reasoning. Like de Tocqueville, Revel has valid criticisms of America, but they are rooted in reason and a respect for truth.    One of the interesting aspects of this book is the use of a more original definition of the term 'liberalism' that indicates independence, personal responsibility, and the distancing of the government from our personal lives. The term has become hijacked by the Left and anything admirable appropriated and subverted by it. Neoliberalism in America now represents just blind hatred, envy, intolerance, hypocrisy, and unadulterated stupidity.    Revel cites statistics and quotes historian Michel Winock to show that hatred of America is not something particularly French or even European, but a sentiment shared mostly by an elite segment of society-- or, at least, those who believe themselves part of the elite. In this sense, European anti-Americanism is not that different from the American variety. This makes sense because rabid anti-Americanism derives mostly from irrational hysteria that has little basis in logic or fact. He gives many examples of the inherent contradiction of criticisms which could equally well be voiced by the American Left.    For example, one peeve of neoliberals is President Bush's rejection of the Kyoto protocol. The Kyoto protocol, of course, had already been rejected 95-0 by the Senate and was only thrown to Bush as a political hot potato by Clinton in a last-minute executive order. Neither Clinton nor any other of the 167 signatories had ratified the protocol, yet somehow America was solely responsible because we had the courage to say what everybody else already knew. Needless to say that the Left never criticized the decades of Earth-destroying pollution that emanated from their favorite Soviet Union.    The antiglobalizers, the shock troops of the Left, elevate irrationality to a philosophy. They oppose open borders but exploit them to wreak havoc in cities around the world. They oppose the World Trade Organization in the name of Third World countries they pretend to care about, but that are themselves the most eager to join. These militants pay lip service to democracy but can only advance their agenda through violence, having no discernible goal but anarchy. They don't really oppose globalism: they would absolutely swoon over global socialism, or better yet, a return to the Terror of Communism.    The French of course have no objection to globalism if it is the French kind. Recall Chirac's lovely comment to the new European countries that came out in our support, of having &quot;missed a historic opportunity to shut up.&quot; French papers gleefully announce rising unemployment in America but ignore the fact that it hovers around 9% at home. France decries globalization but opposes American steel tariffs. France hates American influence but complains that we aren't doing enough in the Balkans or the Arab-Israeli conflict. Even the Marshall Plan which rebuilt Europe after it self-destructed in World War II was just American self-interest: we strenghtened Europe because we wanted to weaken Europe.    For neoliberals, America can't do anything right and is blamed for all evil, but Revel has no patience with the moral relativism that excuses Islamist hyperterrorism. Similarly, while the &quot;pinnacle of evil and imbecility&quot; called the USSR was gobbling up countries across the globe, the only one seen as &quot;imperialistic&quot; was America.    Europe accuses Amerca of fascism and imperialism as a way of absolving itself of responsibility for having invented and nurtured &quot;the two great criminal ideologies of the 20th century&quot; and the most barbarous regimes the world has ever seen. To come to terms with this reality, Europe &quot;would have to admit that the United States was at least partially in the right, a concession that would have caused unbearable psychological stress.&quot; The fact that the United States had to save Europe from itself during two world wars and a Balkan implosion just adds insult to injury. Anti-Americanism is thus based on a deep psychological need.    Another perfect manifestation of this immaturity is Europe's attitude towards Israel's right to exist. Any act of Israeli self-defense reminds Europeans of culpability of one of humanity's greatest crimes. Poignantly summarizing: &quot;Europe will never forgive the Jews for the Holocaust.&quot;    Revel understands that Europe's own failure to act effectively is at least partly to blame for American preeminence, and hopes that his European audience will take his words to heart so that they may regain some footing and respect. Unfortunately for Europe, this is unlikely to happen anytime soon. Old Europe has already made a &quot;principle of powerlessness.&quot;	2004-08-01
US	50429756	R1ETP26YOE6HM0	1580631053	866122690	Vote.com: How Big-Money Lobbyists and the Media are Losing Their Influence, and the Internet is Giving Power to the People	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Taking Triangulation to the Net	Vote.com is ostentatiously a book about how the emergence of the Internet will change the political process. It seems that in referring to &quot;Internet voting&quot; Morris has conflated two ideas: informing and campaigning, and actual polling and voting. As to the former, it is undeniable that the Internet potentially has a major role to play in breaking the elite media stranglehold. Finally having uncensored access to right-wing viewpoints is, if you will, a breath of 'fresh air'. <BR> <BR>The second point is a little stickier. Touting the power of Web polling sites (such as the one run by Morris himself, mentioned several times), it's not obvious why politicians should pay them particular attention compared to more traditional methods, particularly given that Web polls are notoriously unreliable, self-selecting, and open to abuse. As to actual voting on the Net, glossing over the serious inherent security and privacy issues, it's unclear why the act of voting for a presidential candidate through a Web site would do much to change politics-- except to lower the barrier to electoral participation. But if we don't even trust someone to make the effort to cast his ballot on Election Day, can we trust him to take the trouble to inform himself? <BR> <BR>Morris argues that as the Internet has cut out the middleman from stock transactions and travel bookings it will do the same in politics. But it's unclear who this might be, if not our elected representative, and it's completely unfeasible to take him out of the loop. No citizen has the time or interest to engage himself on every possible issue. The whole point of representative democracy is that we place our trust in a proxy. While the Internet may enable us to register our opinions with our representatives, we already have this power through telephone and mail. <BR> <BR>Morris does have interesting ideas on the application of the Internet to campaigning, such as the use of political banner ads, pseudo-interactive multimedia sessions with the candidates (along the lines of early-generation adventure games), or the 'Internet presidential debate'. Although banners will be less effective in modifying my own political beliefs since I disable them in my browser, I have to admit that there is something irresistible in the idea of Bush and Gore slugging it out in a chat room. He flatters us by saying that Internet campaigning will be better because we will reject 'negative' campaigning as less interesting. But it seems just a little optimistic to believe that the 'alienated Internet generation' will magically become engaged by all of this technology.  <BR> <BR>The book isn't too sharply focused, and ventures into unrelated forays that call on Morris' personal experience as a political campaign advisor. These include his thoughts on how Clinton shrunk the Presidency to fit the president, and on what he calls the 'unimpeachment'. The attempts to interpret every recent development in politics to a devolution of power from the mass media to the Internet seem a little strained. Without index or footnotes, this book seems somewhat cobbled together. <BR> <BR>Morris may be right in that traditional campaigning will expand to include this new medium. But as to actual voting, lowering the presidential election to the level of voting on OJ's acquittal would do much damage to the solemnity of the occasion.	2003-10-25

But with the growing urban population the need for political and agricultural reform was recognized, and under the Tsar came the 1861 Emancipation of the Serfs and the privatisation of communal holdings in 1906, so that they gained some degree of freedom. And as their lives improved, so did production. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, self-determination did not fit into Marxist theory. The intelligentsia felt only contempt for the peasantry, which it saw as an impediment to social progress. 9 million died when the peasants revolted against the Bolshevik coup in the 1918-1920 Peasant War. <BR> <BR>Driven by their obsessive analysis of everything as 'bourgeois' or 'proletariat', the Bolsheviks set out to find class struggle in the countryside. Invention of the all-evil kulak farmer enabled them to perpetrate violence against anyone who might resist Soviet power-- in reality, anyone who was slightly more productive or who showed any kind of initiative. One individual who organized a fire-fight was 'exposed' as a kulak. More to the point, the infinitely malleable kulak allowed the Soviet government to perpetrate its war on Ukraine. <BR> <BR>With typical Soviet planning, the Government requisitioned so much grain that none was left for seeding. As a result, the Great Famine of 1921-1922 took an astounding 5 million lives, far exceeding anything seen under the Tsar. Yet, American food aid was prevented from reaching starving Ukrainians and grain was even exported to Russia. <BR> <BR>This could at least theoretically be attributed to sheer incompetence and stupidity. And in 1928, a market fluctuation misinterpreted by Marxist planners again led the State to requisitioning. But stealing the fruit of the peasants' labour obliterated any trust they might still have had in Communists and destroyed all incentive to work. Far from humbled by their firstdisastrous experience, the Soviet government set out on a bold experiment of to forcibly collectivise all private farming in one year. Showing abundance at least in hubris, Stalin's economist Strumilin: &quot;Our task is not to study economics but to change it. We are bound by no laws.&quot; The five year-plan rolled out in 1929 caused fantastic wastage, tens of thousands of tons of grain left rotting because of poorly planned distribution. <BR> <BR>To perpetrate collectivisation, the Soviet government used all the methods of terror at its disposal. Arrest, blackmail, torture, deporation, exile, labor camps, and execution were applied routinely under the euphemistic denomination of 'dekulakization'. Children and wives were sentenced as &quot;members of the family of a traitor to the motherland.&quot; A Soviet analysis calculated that at one point, 400,000 households had been dekulakized, 350,000 still remaining to be, and 250,000 households having 'self-dekulakized'. 1 million died in the collectivisation terror, and another 4 million in labor camps. One novelist wrote: &quot;Not one of them was guilty of anything; but they belonged to a class that was guilty of everything.&quot; <BR> <BR>Having robbed the villages of their most productive members and replacing them with urban sadists, agriculture totally collapsed. The kolkhoz itself proved economically disastrous having about one-sixth the productivity of an American farm. Farmers received one half pound of bread daily and a salary which enabled them to purchase a single pair of shoes at the end of the year. Tractors were unreliable and so scarce they had to be shared between farms a hundred miles apart. The cost of the terror infrastructure and massive bureaucracy meant there was not even an economic benefit to collectivisation. <BR> <BR>The Government set grain prices so absurdly low that they didn't even cover costs. By multiplying total theoretical acreage with the maximum possible yield per acre, they set production quotas that in practice left nothing at all for next year's crop, let alone for food. Hungry and unable to work, fields were left uncultivated and crops spoiled. <BR> <BR>Peasants were shot for trying to reach the gigantic quantities of grain left rotting in the open air or withheld 'in reserve', they were even shot for cutting corn from their own gardens. Ukrainians were prevented from reaching Russia, where food was plenty. Finally they gave in and did what Stalin asked them to: they died. Corpses were removed daily by the trainload to God knows where. Mothers went insane trying to starve their weaker children in order to save her others. Orphans were brought to the children's concentration camp in Kirovohrad to starve, then trucked out under the cover of night. Some kids were cultivated as NKVD interrogators. <BR> <BR>The suffering described in this book is enough to drive anyone to tears. <BR> <BR>The advantage of another 7 million dead Ukrainians was that Russians could be moved into their homes and begin the assault on Ukrainian nationalism. The kozbars, blind bards travelling through villages singing national songs, were invited to a congress where they were all executed. Skrypnyk was sentenced for introducing the soft 'L' and hard 'G' into the alphabet: the hard 'G' in particular had apparently aided 'wreckers'. Russian replaced Ukrainian as the language of instruction, and Ukrainian authors and linguists were almost entirely liquidated. Priests were dekulakized. Cossack stanitsas that put up strong resistance were deported wholesale, entire populations of tens of thousands. <BR> <BR>Still, the Communists touted the success of their system to the world-- though the census figures needed a bit of fudging to hide the fact that a sizeable chunk of the population no longer existed. <BR> <BR>The commentary and reporting of the likes of Walter Duranty of the New York Times or George Bernard Shaw are disgraceful. Duranty was described as &quot;the greatestliar of any journalist I have met in fifty years of journalism.&quot; At least he got a Pulitzer out of it. I hope he chokes on it.	2003-10-23

But with a mere 0.07% sample of voters and the polls still open, they gleefully handed it and the election to Gore. While polls soon showed Bush actually leading, they waited a full six hours to reverse that call. In fact, networks measurably called states for Gore dramatically faster all across the nation. Tom Brokaw was even caught rooting for Gore on air, unsurprising since journalists themselves vote Democrat twelve-to-one. Yale University Law School estimated that the premature calls depressed Republican voter turnout and cost Bush 10,000 votes in Florida alone. Finishing by a shockingly close 1784 votes, Democratic bias arguably cost Bush the popular vote and almost cost him the presidency. <BR> <BR>At Any Cost is a thrilling account of the subsequent wrangling that enthralled the nation. Realizing that recounts alone rarely reverse election outcomes, victory would have to come from the courts. Team Gore deployed its full arsenal on the electoral process and nearly plunged the nation into constitutional crisis, initiating a barrage of stalling tactics designed to cast illegitimacy on the electoral process itself. <BR> <BR>A telemarketing firm hired on the evening of the election asked voters to attest they had been confused by the Palm Beach County butterfly ballots. Since Bush and Gore's names were equally close to Buchanan's, the implication was that Democratic voters were somehow more easily confused. It was also not explained why the ballot (designed by the Democratic elections supervisor) was not found confusing when published in newspapers before the election. Clinton Secretary of State Warren Christopher simply declared the butterfly ballot \\"illegal.\\" The first confused voter to file suit in court was a Democratic Party operative previously convicted of Medicare fraud. <BR> <BR>One countyperformed an illegal secret recount that mysteriously produced ten times as many new votes for Gore. Another found an astounding twelve times more. Nonetheless, Bush still maintained a razor-thin lead at the end of the recount. <BR> <BR>Although not entitled by State law, Gore demanded a third count, restricted to four Democratic counties. Unsure of its legality, the four counties proceeded haphazardly and did not finish before the November 14 deadline. Since State law either required or permitted (depending on your reading) the Secretary of State to invalidate late results, the Democratic smear machine went into full gear against Harris' clothing and make-up. Badly backfiring, they instead evoked an enormous popular outpouring of support. <BR> <BR>Unsolicited, the Florida Supreme Court (all nine justices Democratic nominees) declared an arbitrary new deadline of November 26. Two of the four counties completed that count, while Miami-Dade had already given up and acknowledged they wouldn't meet even the extended deadline. Palm Beach took Thanksgiving off and missed it by two hours. So in accordance with the Florida Supreme Court, Katherine Harris certified George W. Bush the winner by 537 votes. <BR> <BR>Although Gore had promised to \\"abide by [its] result\\", he sued the remaining two counties for a fourth count but was soundly rebuffed by Democratic Judge Sauls. Four days before the Federal deadline for sending electors to Washington, Gore filed suit again demanding that because officials had assisted 2,000 absentee ballot applications, 20,000 absentee ballots should be invalidated. <BR> <BR>Bush had finally had enough. He asked the Federal Supreme Court to mandate a recount in all Florida counties (not just the ones cherry-picked by Gore), but holding also that it should not have extended the deadline set by Florida law. The Court unanimously agreed on the second point and overturned the State ruling. <BR> <BR>The liberal-activist Florida Supreme Court then astoundingly ordered another recount in counties that had missed their own extended deadline, and a recount in all counties of only undervotes even though Florida law required counting all ballots. In some counties it was even impossible to separate the undervotes in time. <BR> <BR>Two hours before the Federal deadline, the US Supreme Court finally ruled to put an end to the recount mess. <BR> <BR>Democrats would later claim they had won the election through the popular vote-- although it was rather curious position for the self-proclaimed 'defenders of the Constitution' to claim this new and completely un-Constitutional procedure. The party that so movingly called for \\"counting every vote\\" was pulling out all the stops to disqualify (mostly military) absentee ballots if the signature on the envelope missed a dotted 'i' or the envelope lacked a postmark. An investigation in twelve Florida counties found 445 votes cast by felons-- extrapolating, that would have accounted statewide for 2,500 illegal votes for Gore. <BR> <BR>In the 1960 election, Richard Nixon declined to force a recount in the election 'assisted' by Chicago machine Richard Daley. In 2000, the Gore campaign managed by his son William Daley had no such qualms. The court challenges to the California gubernatorial recall election hint at a disturbing trend by the Left to win elections in the courts. As Al Gore told his aides: \\"I'm not like George Bush. If he wins or loses, life goes on. I'll do anything to win.\\"	2003-10-08

To say that in the 1930s Stalin snuffed out twenty million of his citizens hardly begins to describe the essential evil of his rule, which caused indescribable suffering for countless millions more, not to mention plunged the world into war for decades. <BR> <BR>It's easily forgotten that the October 1917 coup by which the Bolshevik intellegentsia came to power lacked popular support and by 1921 had lost any semblance of representing the proletariat. From its inception, the party of Lenin and Trotsky embraced deceit, violence, and willingness to sacrifice others as a means to power, bringing Hitler later to say that unlike Social Democrats \\"he could always turn a Communist into a Nazi.\\" Stalin merely took the context of intolerance to its logical extreme, plotting the decimation of his opposition into ever smaller groups, assisted by the very ones that would themselves successively be destroyed by it: Trotskyites, then Rightists, Bukharinites, Zinovievites, and finally the Stalinists themselves. The 1937 Plenum already marked the complete transformation into autocracy. <BR> <BR>Key to Stalin's success were his patience and that he never revealed (or tested) the limits of his ruthlessness. Rivals continually underestimated him: Trotskyites supported the disastrous 1930 agricultural collectivisation, miscalculating that he wouldn't dare another repression and the peasants would revolt-- but Stalin did impose an even worse famine two years later, starving an unimaginable 10 million Russians and Ukrainians. Supporters and opponents alike never held him personally responsible: even the Terror itself was called the Yezhovschina. Victims could be persuaded that the Terror was in the interest of Communism not Stalin, and it is to this day unknown whether Stalin himself believed it. His capriciousness and promises of leniency induced even high officials to produce confessions and denunciations, hoping that perhaps one more obscenity committed in his service might restore them to favour. <BR> <BR>At first, at least an actual crime and the formality of a show trial were needed. The fringe benefit of Stalin's assassination of Kirov was that other opponents could be executed for it. Convictions relied solely on confessions that were rather blatantly inconsistent and sometimes bizarre. Though brave individuals sometimes recanted at trial, they fell back into line after a short 'recess'. The rare evidence introduced that was actually verifiable was knowingly false: for example, the Copenhagen Hotel Bristol where Sedov had allegedly met had actually been demolished at the time. But full show trials were a luxury reserved for the Party elite. One court report simply read: \\"No prosecutor. No witnesses. No co-accused. No defender.\\" <BR> <BR>The crimes themselves were soon completely fatuous. Article 58 of the Criminal Code outlawed \\"flight abroad,\\" \\"lack of faith in the Socialist state,\\" and fascinatingly \\"suspicion of espionage.\\" Insufficient loyalty to Stalin was fatal. Workers or managers who failed to meet their quotas were convicted of sabotage, as indeed were NKVD investigators for failing to meet their 'arrest quotas'. Doctors were convicted for assassinating Gorky by smoke from bonfires, Jews for spying for Nazi Germany, and clergy for praying. Purges soon reached to the citizenry, and the mere misfortune of being denounced practically guaranteed guilt. <br />Confessions were wrought by horrible torture. Wives and children of accused were held hostage and often shared their fate. Children under the age of 17 were despatched to NKVD settlements. Overflowing cells built for twelve held a hundred, so that prisoners had to pack down sideways like sardines-- and only in shifts. Most could not withstand round-the-clock beatings for more than a few months and succumbed, although a few exceptional individuals held out. <BR> <BR>The horror of the gulag is beyond comprehension. Camps were brutal, soul-destroying, ruled on behalf of guards by hard-core criminals. The journey to the camps was deadly and could last months. Outside work was compulsory until temperatures dropped below -50 *C. Inmates were starved and savaged by epidemics. Perhaps the best thing about them was that one would not be expected to survive more than two years. In Kolymev only three out of every hundred survived. From Novaya Zembla, nobody returned at all. <BR> <BR>It's unknown whether the Purges stopped because the courts were overstretched or because the geometric rate of denunciations would soon have implicated the entire population. Fully 5% of the population had been arrested, while 7 million people languished in camps. Of the original partisans and Bolsheviks no-one at all remained. The Terror machinery nonetheless continued at a more controlled pitch, and the gulag population would grow to 12 million at Stalin's death in 1953. Soviet science, technology, and the military were robbed of their best people. The cumulative psychological effect of the Terror nightmare on generations of Soviets is unimaginable. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, the West generally left these citizens to their fate. Driven by Communist idealism, foreign correspondents ignored, glossed over, or simply flat-out lied about the show trials. Jean-Paul Sartre and other intellectuals still denied the existence of the gulag long after its evidence was undeniable. A French literary journal called Victor Kravchenko's account of the camps a lie. The New York Times' Walter Duranty received a Pulitzer prize for his Stalin apologia. <BR> <BR>The Left never let facts get in the way of an attractive ideology, and never understood that \\"not even high intelligence and a sensitive spirit are of any help once the facts of a situation are deduced from a political theory, rather than vice versa.\\" That neither Stalin, nor his ideology, have ever been fully held accountable is maddening and a disgrace to thememory of his victims.	2003-10-07

After two terms of lies, corruption, slander, and immorality that were their trademark, was another book about the Clintons really needed? If only to reveal their contempt for the nation and Constitution, if only to see that eventually even Democrats had had enough-- yes, this book was tremendously necessary. <BR> <BR>The Clinton presidency was like none other. The man who called late at night to proposition Cyd Dunlop in the hotel room where she stayed with her husband, who was forced to confess on national television to his affair with Gennifer Flowers, brought a New Republic editor to conclude that his persistent adulterizing revealed \\"a frightening lack of self-control.\\" Arkansas troopers admitted that they had procured more than a hundred women for Clinton. <BR> <BR>One of those women refused to be cowed and became the bane of his presidency: Paula Corbin Jones would pay dearly at the hand of the savage Clinton slander machine. Eight years later, in return for immunity from prosecution, Clinton landed a sweetheart deal in which he admitted knowingly violating a judge's order to tell the truth. A federal court held him in contempt for making false statements in a federal proceeding, and Arkansas disbarred him for five years. <BR> <BR>Upon leaving the White House, they rather unsubtly opened gift registries with luxury retailers, and Clinton acolytes took the hint. Expensive White House art was shipped to the Clinton Library, and furniture to their new upstate New York home. Terry McAuliffe financed that home and was rewarded with the leadership of the Democratic National Committee. <BR> <BR>When Newt Gingrich accepted a $4.5 million book advance, Democrats howled in protest, so he returned the advance and settled symbolically for one dollar. When Mr and Mrs Clinton accepted $8 and $10 million respectively for their ghostwritten books, there was no outcry. Senator Hillary refused to have her deal vetted by the Ethics Committee. <BR> <BR>Hillary is one tough cookie. Author Michael Tomasky: \\"With Hillary, there was something about the way she answered questions that only raised other questions.\\" In 1991 she reportedly chewed out an Arkansas state trooper: \\"Where is the [g-dm] [f-ing] flag? I want the [g-dm] [f-ing] flag up every [f-ing] morning at [f-ing] sunrise.\\" Did she really once claim her husband and daughters's used underwear as a tax deduction? She interned for Communist Party lawyer and Stalinist Robert Treuhaft and later admitted to a journalist that \\"I want to run something.\\" <BR> <BR>She demonstrated her respect for New York taxpayers by renting her Manhattan offices at more than half a million dollars per year, more than double the amount paid by her co-Senator Charles Schumer. Bill billed the government $830,000 for the entire 56th floor of the Carnegie Hall Towers, almost three times more than any other president. <BR> <BR>But most flagrant was the spasm of executive orders and pardons issued on the very last day of his presidency: <BR> <BR>* Drug offenders, including one money launderer for the Colombian Cali cartel. <BR> <BR>* Major cocaine dealers: one made a $200,000 payment to Hillary's brother, and another $200,000 went to his law firm one day after convicted swindler Braswell was pardoned. A $175,000 donation from this same crook to the Republican campaign was returned when they learned of his felony record. <BR> <BR>* An automobile dealer convicted of fraud was pardoned two weeks after his friend made a $500,000 pledge to the Clinton Library. <BR> <BR>* Symbionese Liberation Army guerilla Patty Hearst, and hard-Left celebrity Susan Rosenberg of the Weather Underground who had killed a guard and two police officers. <BR> <BR>* In return for votes for Hillary's campaign, FALN terrorists (who hadn't even petitioned for a pardon) and four ultra-orthodox New Square fraudsters. <BR> <BR>* Whitewater partner Susan McDougal, three of his Cabinet-level appointees (Espy, Cisneros, and Deutch), and the first ever presidential pardon of a family member (his half-brother Roger). <BR> <BR>* Billionaire Marc Rich, who sold oil to South Africa (then a pariah nation), traded with Iran after Carter had embargoed it for holding the American Embassy staff hostage, terrorist Libya in contradiction of an embargo, the Soviet Union, and Cuba. He tried to buy oil from Iraq during its embargo after invading Kuwait, and committed the largest tax fraud in American history. Having fled to Switzerland and living in luxury, his wife donated $15 million to Clinton causes. Rudolph Giuliani was so incredulous that he asked an aide to recheck the news, and still refused to believe that Clinton would have pardoned this fugitive who had avoided a trial and never spent a day in prison. <BR> <BR>Seeminly unruffled during the preceding eight years of perfidy, this last orgy of abuse was too much even for fellow Democrats and liberals. <BR> <BR>A DNC official: \\"Mr Clinton didn't just take the White House china; he took its soul and flushed it down the toilet.\\" Chief of Staff under Carter, Hamilton Jordan declared that if he had petitioned a pardon of a contributor to his library \\"he would [...] probably have fired me on the spot.\\" New York Times columnist Bob Herbert: \\"With Mr Clinton at the controls, the party won the White House twice. But in the process it lost its bearings and maybe even its soul.\\" Dick Morris, who helped his 1996 reelection, opined that history would judge Clinton as \\"one of the most corrupt US presidents.\\" <BR> <BR>And New Republic columnist Andrew Sullivan: \\"We asked for it. We elected him.\\"	2003-09-19

Upon accepting the offer to become Chief Investigative Counsel of the House Judiciary Committee, David Schippers assembled a professional, hard-working, and highly ethical team to prepare impeachment proceedings against Clinton. A lifelong Chicago Democrat who worked for Robert Kennedy and voted for Clinton in both presidential elections, he nonetheless became thoroughly disenchanted with the \\"lies, cowardice, hypocrisy, cynicism, amorality, butt-covering\\" among House Democrats and the Senate. <BR> <BR>The second American president to be impeached, Clinton claimed the vast right-wing conspiracy was circumventing the Constitution. In fact, the impeachment process was specifically designed by the Founding Fathers as part of our system of checks and balances, but the Senate leadership ensured its failure. Schippers wanted to follow the procedure used against President Nixon, but the likes of Senator Ted Stevens quickly clarified that this was no Watergate: \\"I don't care if you prove he raped a woman and shot her dead-- you are not going to get [the] votes.\\" On whether the Senators would ignore their oath \\"to do equal and impartial justice,\\" he replies: \\"You're damn right they are.\\" One Democratic Congressman overheard as saying \\"My God, this is indefensible. The man is a perjurer, a liar, he's obstructing justice. How can we defend him?\\" nonetheless voted against impeachment. Among the rare voices of integrity was Democrat Joe Lieberman. <BR> <BR>Schippers is a straight-talker and doesn't pull any punches. Countering noncooperation from Attorney-General Reno's Department of Justice, he promises an Obstruction of Congress charge. When Reno refused to supply reports from FBI Director Louis Freeh and DoJ prosecutor Charles LaBella, he plays severe hardball and eventually nearly succeeds. Tipped off that the White House is setting him up, and if he accepts the reports they will be immediately leaked, Schippers declines them-- Clinton wins. <BR> <BR>Contrary to received propaganda, Clinton's transgressions were not about sex. Even with all the stonewalling and intimidation, the Judiciary Committee gathered evidence to support 15 separate felonies, among which perjury, witness tampering, and suborning perjury. Because of constraints imposed on the inquiry, much was not even investigated: illegal foreign campaign contributions (Chinagate), illegal possession of secret FBI personnel files (Filegate), the firing and slandering of the travel office staff (Travelgate), selling of Commerce Department junkets for campaign contributions (Commercegate), and perjury over his tawdry adulterous affairs with Kathleen Willey, Dolly Kyle Browning, and Gennifer Flowers. <BR> <BR>Clinton's rape (as Arkansas Attorney-General) of Juanita Broaddrick is simply heinous. When he appeared to have finished, he told his victim \\"My God, I can do it again!\\" and did. She kept quiet, and at a later fundraiser Hillary approached her and said \\"I've heard so much about you [...]. We appreciate everything you do,\\" though she hadn't worked for their campaign. When Clinton's conquests were subpoenaed in the Paula Jones case, they were pressured into providing false depositions or threatened (sometimes grotesquely). <BR> <BR>The White House coerced the INS to grant citizenship to aliens likely to vote Democratic by waiving normal security checks. Accounting firm KPMG established that over 250,000 aliens with certain or unverified arrest records obtained citizenship, and in a sample of 100 aliens with serious prior criminal records 20% now had FBI arrest records for serious crimes committed after obtaining citizenship. <BR> <BR>The day before the debate and vote on the articles of impeachment, Clinton bombs Iraq.  <BR> <BR>Schippers reproduces some of the support and hate mail he received, and one poignant letter is worth quoting: \\"I am writing to you because my friend Eddie saw you on TV and said you were moral and tough. My Dad is a lot like the President because he likes to have ladies sleep over when my Mom's away. I don't like that. I was wondering if you could help impeach my Dad?\\"	2003-08-15

Political consultant Dick Morris was highly influential in managing this campaign, and retracing his collaboration with the Clintons back to the Arkansas gubernatorial campaigns, he peeks inside Clinton and his White House. <BR> <BR>Morris was also the one who gave the American political world 'triangulation'. If (as he insists too many times) triangulation is not really shaping of policy by polling but merely the shaping of presentation by polling, it would still be terribly disingenuous toward the voter. But I think even he realizes that cherry-picking other people's policies in order to win elections is not leadership. <BR> <BR>In fact, a lack of leadership is indicative of the Clinton White House itself. According to Morris, Clinton suffers from a chronic inability to fire under- or misperforming members of his staff (inadvertently giving another clue as to who really was responsible for firing the travel office staff). He creates chaos and infighting, then drifts around waiting for someone to move in his direction whom he then supports. Morris describes a permanent near state of war between White House chief of staff Leon Panetta and deputies Harold Ickes and Erskine Bowles. Such is the manner that Clinton exerts control. <BR> <BR>But then he isn't much of a team player-- he even keeps Morris out of sight from his staff because he wanted him to himself. Later, paranoia erupts when Clinton accuses Morris of hogging Al Gore, and fearing abandonment by his boss, Gore accuses Clinton of the same. <BR> <BR>Clinton spent an astounding $85 million in his reelection campaign. In the previous presidential election, both candidates spent less than half that amount. Obviously this war chest drained an enormous amount of time and energy from Clinton's other job as president. Quoting Clinton: \\"I can't think. I can't act. I can't do anything but go to fund-raisers and shake hands. You want me to issue executive orders; I can't focus on a thing but the next fund-raiser. Hillary can't, Al can't-- we're all getting sick and crazy because of it.\\" <BR> <BR>Interestingly, Clinton doesn't even watch television news-- or read newspapers, with the exception of the New York Times and Washington Post op-ed pages. <BR> <BR>Morris describes the reason for not supporting a cut in the capital gains tax. Their own experts had agreed with President Ronald Reagan's rationale that such a cut not only would not cost anything but would even raise revenue, but they still opposed it because it would make them look \\"too Republican.\\" So they screwed American workers for cosmetics' sake. He describes Clinton's strategy to pass a welfare reform bill to help his election, but then force changes in it after being locked into the White House. Morris has many good words for Trent Lott, but being a good Senator couldn't save him from being lambasted over an off-hand remark at Strom Thurmond's centenary. <BR> <BR>Not much is mentioned about foreign affairs, but what is doesn't speak well for Clinton's grasp of it. On the victory of Prime Minister Netanyahu in the 1996 Israeli elections, Clinton flatly concludes that the \\"Israelis are not ready for peace,\\" forgetting that following countless terror attacks on its citizens after the disastrous Clinton-sponsored Israeli/Palestinian peace agreements, Israelis voted Netanyahu in office precisely because he was the only one who could credibly bring peace. <BR> <BR>Sooner or later everyone strays into Hillary's dark side, and Morris commits the sin of recounting how she wanted a swimming pool in their taxpayer-funded Arkansas governor's mansion. It is fairly amusing to read the fawning and sycophantic groveling he had to endure to be restored in her favor. <BR> <BR>Behind the White House is a fairly interesting read, though it suffers from sloppy editing. Are \\"honesty, honor, reliability\\" really adjectives in the Democratic lexicon? It has its share of political correctness: why does 'Arab terrorists' need quotes? Truman 'lost' China, but Clinton didn't want to lose Russia. <BR> <BR>Dick Morris seems a generally honorable professional who is good at what he does, though I'm left to wonder whether this is good for the electorate or the country. In order to raise the astronomical amounts of cash needed for the marketing of what Morris calls the \\"first fully advertised presidency in US history,\\" Clinton by his own admission was incapacitated from his duties. As we now know, the methods used to raise the cash were illegal, sometimes damaging to our national security, and always reprehensible.	2003-08-14

For this, we was hounded and slandered relentlessly by the Left, his associates gay-baited, his very name made a malediction for generations to come. But was he right?<br /><br />Definitive evidence shows that Joseph McCarthy was right to an extent even he could not have imagined. Venona describes the ultra-secret code-breaking project begun by Carter Clarke of the US Army Military Intelligence division and later run by the National Security Agency. Through incredible persistence and ingenuity, we managed to intercept and decode secret communications between Moscow and its embassies in America. The work that went into this effort is astounding, and even though we managed to decrypt only a tiny fraction of that traffic, the information that we obtained showed that the United States government was infiltrated to the highest levels.<br /><br />Roosevelt was not even made aware of the Venona project because his personal aide Lauchlin Currie was a Soviet spy. The director of the International Monetary Fund, Harry Dexter White, was a Soviet spy. Alger Hiss, assistant to the Secretary of State and advising Roosevelt at Yalta, was a Soviet spy.<br /><br />If American liberals didn't think that Communist Party members were potential recruits, the KGB certainly did. Beginning in 1942, the Soviets abused our war-time alliance to stage an all-out espionage assault on our territory. Hundreds, literally hundreds of CPUSA members were active spies. Haynes and Klehr conclude that one-seventh to one-third of OSS employees were Soviet agents. Venona clearly shows that CPUSA operations were not directed by its nominal leader but by Moscow. After the end of World War II, the CPUSA tried to expand its base by allying itself with the Democratic Party but reversed under direction from Moscow.<br /><br />But KGB operations on American soil were not limited to spying alone. Defectors from the USSR who jumped ship seeking refuge here were kidnapped from American soil and restored to the Soviet Union. The CPUSA also provided invaluable assistance to the assassins sent to kill Trotsky in Mexico.<br /><br />Disinformation campaigns were mounted to affect public opinion of the USSR. The KGB used journalists to influence editorial policy as well as obtain inside information. Stephen Laird would report in The New Republic the Polish elections as being free and fair, a view not shared by many of his colleagues. Journalist I.F. Stone, hailed by the elite when he spread the lie that the United States started the war in Korea, was on the KGB payroll. In France, the Communist party ran a campaign of defeatism toward the German invasion.<br /><br />The naivety and apologetics of some of the Soviets' supporters is beyond belief. Open Communist sympathisers and spies were fêted by the social elite. Academicians readily took up the cause of KGB spies, assassins, and traitors. Books written in the 70s about Senator McCarthy still exculpate people whom we know beyond the shadow of a doubt were Soviet spies. While Laurence Duggan is often described as an innocent victim driven to suicide after relentless FBI interrogation, he was in fact Soviet a spy who saw the jig was up. Ironically, Maurice Halperin, a spy who escaped arrest, became disillusioned first by Soviet and then Cuban Communism and eventually settled in Canada.<br /><br />But also politicians on the Left showed bad judgment. The State Department convinced Roosevelt to return as a goodwill measure to the USSR, uncopied, code books that were found in Finland and that would have had fantastic intelligence value. Truman ignored the Venona evidence and dismantled the OSS after World War II, reversing himself in 1947 fearing Republican charges of laxity. Further interesting is learning how the persistence of Richard Nixon helped expose more spies, and that the FBI and J. Edgar Hoover actually protested the internment of Japanese during World War II.<br /><br />Although the FBI at times was really on the ball in investigating espionage, they had great difficulty obtaining convictions because of the inability to use intelligence evidence in court, or even indictments because of the State Department's desire not to upset relations with the Soviet Union. Even after having actually witnessed Judith Coplon handing over state secrets to a KGB agent, that evidence was ruled inadmissible. Many spies were never punished at all for their crimes.<br /><br />The Rosenbergs were not only spies themselves but actively recruited their own network which did horrifying damage to our national security. They handed over designs for advanced jet engines, radar systems, and the highly advanced 'proximity fuse'. When they were arrested, two members of their ring (Alfred Sarant and Joel Barr) immediately escaped to the USSR where they received fantastic benefits not accorded to ordinary Soviet citizens. They founded the Soviet microelectronics industry and created the first Soviet radar-guided anti-aircraft missle system which became highly successful against the United States during the Vietnam War. Of course, the Rosenberg ring allowed the Soviets to develop the atomic bomb and terrorize the free world for the next half a century. In his memoirs, Khrushchev thanked the Rosenbergs for their sacrifice to the Communist cause.<br /><br />Haynes and Klehr proffer the suggestion that the penalties against convicted spies might have been less severe had the Venona evidence been made public at the time. Given the extent of damage that was done to our national security I find this difficult to believe, but in any case it is ludicrous to expect the United States to surrender its most valuable intelligence source to exonerate traitors.<br /><br />Oh, and the KGB code name for Julius Rosenberg?

And all this is taking place here, in the United States. The fruits of his investigation gradually grew into a clearinghouse of terror data, and culminated in an acclaimed PBS documentary titled \\"Jihad in America\\" that won the George Polk award.  <BR> <BR>This book is a continuation of the theme. Naturally, such blatant practice of freedom of expression could not be allowed to go unpunished, and it was not long before violence and death threats forced the author into hiding.  <BR> <BR>Some of the most grotesque institutions of terror have established themselves and operate out of America, publically proclaiming peace but perpetrating hate, destruction, and jihad in private. The groups that operate under such saccharine banners as 'literacy groups' or 'youth associations' engage in organized crime, money laundering, sham marriages, and immigration fraud. Many pro-Islamic institutions in the U.S. are actually funded directly by Saudi Arabia.  <BR> <BR>The book recalls the exasperation of federal agencies who were not permitted to investigate these groups, their hands so tied that they couldn't attend terror conferences or even examine publically available data. Individual agents were actually prosecuted for attempting to investigate them. It is a testament to the professionalism and tenacity of the FBI that it nonetheless was able to prevent many attacks, among which the Day of Terror in New York City, the attempted bombing of American airliners, and the assassination of the Pope. Some of the schemes and people mentioned in this book were highlighted in the highly recommended Frontline documentary about John O'Neill.  <BR> <BR>The terror networks are not invincible, and current events show that the tide is turning. Our investigation and prosecution of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing is awe-inspiring, but law enforcement must be permitted to be proactive. Emerson describes a Hamas leader who is also a tenured professor at the University of South Florida. Al-Arian was in fact finally arrested a few weeks ago, a full year after the publication of this book.  <BR> <BR>The web of Islamic terror spreading through mosques is far-reaching, and Emerson acknowledges that he can touch only on a small part of it in this book. What becomes clear is that the organizations of terror are interconnected, and that it is pointless to distinguish between groups who only want to kill Americans, or just Jews, or only Hindus. Islamists suffer from what Emerson calls 'an extreme form of mission creep': everyone is a target.  <BR> <BR>We relaxed our stance in the 90s in the hope that only Israel was the target of terror. We know now that Islamism has the entire free world in its sights. But if we have the will we can defeat those who would destroy civilization.	2003-07-29

David Limbaugh analyzes how the Clinton White House abused Justice to further its political ends and escape responsbility for its misdeeds. Hillary Clinton similarly showed no compunctions in sacrificing the White House travel office staff that served previous administations loyally simply because she \\"needed the slots.\\" After two and a half years of slander that destroyed their professional careers, Bill Clinton felt their pain and moved on: the lessons learned from the political fall-out would serve them well in subsequent scandals.  <BR> <BR>They learned to deflect criticism through stonewalling, intimidation, smear, and slander, aided by the DoJ and abetted by the media's hyperselective reporting that overlooked eight years of rot. Little wonder that Democrats are worried by the morality of John Ashcroft, and the weakening of the liberal stranglehold on media through cable TV and talk radio (Clinton's Vice President is now planning to give us Gore TV).  <BR> <BR>They accused Billy Dale of financial misconduct when their own Arkansas World-Wide Travel cronies were wasting money. They accused Kenneth Starr of leaking information when the source was the White House itself. They accused Linda Tripp of vindictiveness while Hillary Clinton railroaded anyone who interfered with her ambitions. They accused Paula Jones of promiscuity when the philanderer-in-chief occupied the White House. They accused the Republican National Committee of soliciting foreign campaign contributions just as the Democrats were selling out our national security to any foreign interest with cash.  <BR> <BR>To stonewall any investiagations that did occur Clinton invoked more than a dozen times executive privilege that Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Bush used only about once a term. They tried to create ficticious new privileges that would have implicated the prestigious Secret Service in evasion of justice. DoJ helped to render ineffective the Office of Independent Counsel which was created expressely for the purpose of avoiding the conflict of interest when it investigates its own boss. Of course, in the grotesque and horrifying Democratic foreign campaign finance scandals, Janet Reno simply refused to establish any independent counsel at all even though its own task force chief LaBella and FBI director Freeh recommended it. For his efforts, LaBella got payback soon thereafter.  <BR> <BR>Limbaugh draws on different cases and scandals. In regard to Elin Gonzales, tobacco lawsuits, or the Waco Branch Davidians, the author really fails to convincingly demonstrate an inappropriate link from Justice to the White House, or even that Justice acted improperly in the first place. He much more effectively demonstrates how the Clintons abused Justice in scandals that originated in the White House itself.  <BR> <BR>In the end, Limbaugh has presented a plausible indictment of the Clinton's subversion of the Department of Justice: just one more once proud institution dragged through the mud in their hunger for power. In his failed election bid, Al Gore applied his experience to use the courts to circumvent the Constitution. Sometimes, though, Justice does prevail.	2003-06-29
US	50429756	R2OWY3422RQ7K0	0060393408	962636193	The Case Against Hillary Clinton	Books	4	35	52	N	N	They're Never Going to Leave	In this delightful book, Peggy Noonan uses the speechwriting skills that she lent so effectively to the Reagan White House to hilarious effect by getting into the mind of our first co-president, the most powerful and unaccountable woman in the United States.  <BR> <BR>Though written before Hillary Clinton's election to the Senate, the book opens with an imagined account of a victory speech where she finally snubs the serial adulterer. But the rest of the book demonstrates her political unfitness to represent a state she has \\"no connection to, no history with, no previously demonstrated interest in.\\" Anticipating the charge usually leveled against anyone who doesn't stomach their prevarications as a 'Clinton hater', she quotes Christopher Hitchens: \\"I do not hate them, I have contempt for them.\\"  <BR> <BR>Of course, it doesn't hurt to have on your side an all-forgiving press that doesn't mind being played for a fool. The media were willingly complicit because they shared the Clinton's left-wing utopia of big federal and world government, and their distrust of working-class citizens to make decisions regarding their own lives. This distrust was reflected in the Hillarycare fiasco, where the courts were required to crack the obsessive secrecy surrounding her Task Force. In the end, the lack of public consultation produced a behemoth of unworkable complexity that was doomed from the beginning.  <BR> <BR>Nor does it hurt to install a staff with steamroller mindset, utterly and blindingly loyal, unafraid to flatten anyone that gets in your way, chewing up anybody who is not willing to sacrifice their integrity to the cause. Hillary showed no compunction about destroying the lives of the White House travel office staff who had served loyally for decades. Hillary's staff illegally held hundreds of classified FBI files that could be used against Republican officials.  Years of Clinton governorship and presidency taught that you can get away with absolutely anything if you deny, evade, prevaricate, attack, and smear. <BR> <BR>And it certainly doesn't hurt that your husband barters his office for your campaign. The book goes into some detail about the Americans killed or injured by the FALN terrorists who were pardoned by Bill Clinton in return for campaign donations.  <BR> <BR>Peggy Noonan drives home the obscenity of their behavior by an ingenious application of fictional device. For instance, we see how the Clintons debased our own standards of governance when she transplants George and Barbara Bush into their roles. When she presents a hypothetical meeting of Hillary using her influence with the entertainment industry, we begin to comprehend the tragedy of a squandered presidency. The Clinton legacy is the pursuit of power for its own sake, having no perceptible loyalty or ideology, and having no other goal than to perpetuate itself.  <BR> <BR>Peggy Noonan with an endearing tone relates a story about the woman who channels Eleanor Roosevelt, and sadness at the lack of humility that is the mark of a great leader. It is the story of a woman who sold her soul and our trust for a shot at power. \\"Then there came the moment when I realized: They're never going to leave.\\"	2003-02-28

In this age of moral relativism where \\"truth is lies\\", Ann Coulter gives a much-needed background to the historical meaning of these words, from the days of the British monarchy where they originated, through their inclusion by the Founding Fathers, to the day when they were used to frame articles of impeachment against President Nixon.  <br />The bulk of the book is dedicated to applying this standard to the catalog of misbehavior of the Clinton Administration. Written as it was when the question of removal from office was still open, the book has a passionate tone which in hindsight feels somewhat futile now that we know Congress was unable to live up to its responsiblity. Nonetheless, that tone demonstrates a certain credibility of someone who cares deeply about our government and the presidency. <BR> <BR>And on reading this book, one cannot but feel saddened to realize how low the stature of the Presidency has sunk under that administration. Barely palatable even when spread out over its full eight years, the sheer volume of muck concentrated in one volume is almost too much to swallow. Bill Clinton abused his positions as governor and president to procure and then pay off women at taxpayer's expense, and to cover it up lied countless times, perjured himself under oath, and suborned perjury of others. But all that is only the beginning.  <BR> <BR>In Travelgate, the White House travel office staff was fired at the behest of Mrs Clinton so that she could fill those \\"slots\\" with \\"her people\\". Filegate had nine hundred FBI background files on Republican officials illegally in the possession of the White House. During Fostergate, White House officials obstructed an FBI investigation into the suicide of White House counsel Vincent Foster. In the Whitewater affair, taxpayers were defrauded of millions of dollars while theWhite House obstructed the investigation every step of the way and paid off the silence of indicted counsel. The White House was rented off like a common bed-and-breakfast and coffee house. The Clinton Administration used IRS audits as an instrument of threat and vengeance on its enemies. Perhaps worst of all, in what comes horrifyingly close to treason, the Administration permitted the release of CIA briefings and classified missile technology to China in return for staggering campaign contributions.  <BR> <BR>Since the book was written while Mr Clinton was still in office, it does not even mention the later scandals that plagued the last years of that administration, such as the eleventh-hour pardoning of fugitives and felons who made large contributions to the Democratic Party in Pardongate.  <BR> <BR>It is hard to say whether it is worse that this person served as our president, or his apologists' astounding insistence that the perfidy of his presidency somehow doesn't matter. It wasn't always like this. The Rodino report, which laid down the reasoning for proceedings against President Nixon, noted that \\"the scope of impeachment was not viewed narrowly\\" as a purely criminal matter but also considered maintaining the prestige and respect of the office. Fascinatingly, party to the Rodino hearings was none other than Hillary Rodham Clinton.  <BR> <BR>Ann Coulter is a knowledgeable, deliciously sharp, and unquestionably intelligent writer-- I would recommend any of her books, as well as the syndicated column which appears also on her Web site. High Crimes and Misdemeanors is well researched and annotated, and leaves me asking rhetorically about those eight dark years: what in the world were we thinking?	2003-02-18

Not Christianity: Mapplethorpe's defamatory photography is not only tolerated but subsidized.  Nor anti-Semitism: so rampant on our campuses, it is constitutionally protected.  There is only one religion benefiting from so much deference and hypersensitivity that it can trigger the recall of books, cause the dismissal of teachers, and bring politicians trembling to their knees. <BR> <BR>This repression of free speech has been long ongoing outside of our borders.  An insufficiently respectful British author was rewarded with a contract on his life, and translators of his book were assassinated.  Open religious discourse has quite ceased to exist in the Arab world, with intense discrimination against Christians, Jews, and Hindus. <BR> <BR>Daniel Pipes' work reiterates things we knew but somehow got repressed from our public consciousness, and reveals much else which never made it there in the first place.  Fabulously detailed and with a wealth of references, this guide clarifies the ongoing war that culminated on September 11. <BR> <BR>Pipes makes a wonderfully clear distinction between the religion of Islam and the political ideology called Islamism.  Like communism and fascism, Islamism seeks the overthrow of democratic society by individuals who feel excluded from an elite they should be part of.  Islamists are typically educated middle-class young men masquerading in religion while indulging in perversely un-Islamic behavior.  By Princeton historian Sean Wilentz, terrorism is caused by \\"money, education, and privilege.\\" <BR> <BR>Recalling early successes in science, technology, and world domination, Islamists suffer from traumatic frustration ingrained over a thousand years of severe social, political, and ecomonic failure and the inability to improve.  Western education only fuels the envy and heightens the sense of impotence.  Little else binding them than hatred towards the West, wars between Muslim nations are in fact three times more common than those against infidel nations. <BR> <BR>Ironically, ignorance obscures the fact that modern Islam actually borrows from Christianity.  The Islamist repudiation of the importance of \\"who you are\\" for \\"where you are\\" copies the Western notions of nation-state and jurisdiction.  A rather flimsy and self-contradictory Islamic theory of economics is based on Marxism and fascism.  It is no surprise that Islamisation is inevitably followed by severe economic failure and political repression. <BR> <BR>Far from suffering discrimination, Muslims have a privileged position in the United States and are thriving, ready to complain about any perceived slight, winning fantastic monetary settlements, and inducing employers to provide religious sensiti-i-i-vity training.  Even 'Married With Children' is not safe from the Muslim protests after September 11. <BR> <BR>Middle Eastern academic studies are suffering an all-time low credibility, having been tainted with a wash of Saudi oil money that sponsors intellectually vacuous teaching and writing, farcical distinctions between 'good' and 'bad' Islamism (as if the overthrow of civilzation could be good by any means), or dangerously denying there is any threat at all.  Quoting one militant, \\"a moderate Islamist is someone who does not have the means of acting ruthlessly to seize power immediately.\\" <BR> <BR>While our Government repeats the mistake of Napoleon and Mussolini of sweet-talking to curry favor with the Muslim world, American Muslim leaders are openly calling for the conversion of the United States into a caliphate.  Many clerics agree that the tenets of Islam are fundamentally incompatible with our Constitution.  Says one, \\"Muslims cannot accept the legitimacy of the secular system in the United States.\\"  The strategy for imposing Shari'a in America includes demoralization by terror, immigration, reproduction, and conversion; the latter feeding off the culture of liberal 'blame America first' self-hatred that causes many to accept Islam mostly as a protest against their heritage. <BR> <BR>Daniel Pipes has managed to write a fair and courageous book that is deeply troubling but greatly inspiring.  Packing so much information and private and public policy recommendations, this could have been a much longer book, and one will want to reread it often.  If Hamas believes we are in a \\"battle of civilizations\\", we are in it for the long haul.	2003-01-31
US	50429756	R1R4BP3A2K4W2I	0812929985	441816588	Change Your Brain, Change Your Life: The Breakthrough Program for Conquering Anxiety, Depression, Obsessiveness, Anger, and Impulsiveness	Books	1	289	368	N	N	Chicken Soup for the Brain	Based on his experience with functional brain imaging, Dr Amen has come up with a model of the relationship between behavior and brain structure. The model is a partition of the brain into five regions, and a mapping of most (if not all) psychological problems onto over- or underactivity in one of these regions. By surgery or medication that targets the afflicted parts, the problems can be cured. He presents some compelling anecdotal evidence that brain physiology causes behavioral problems. But then anecdotal evidence usually is compelling.  <BR> <BR>Dr Amen has written another \\"breakthrough\\" book on curing Attention Deficit Disorder, one about spiritual growth, and another about dealing with relationship problems. One might wonder whether the doctor is spreading his expertise somewhat thin, but these fields are in fact connected in that medication can correct all sorts of misbehavior. The book actually does present an example of marriage counseling by medication. But when it relates chemistry to how close or distant we feel from God, it feels like we're leaving the solid ground of science and being launched into the astral plane.  <BR> <BR>On closer reflection, many anecdotes given in evidence of the model can be extremely tenuous. Is it really true that grief over the death of a loved one boils down to a \\"deep limbic loss\\" of touch, voice, and smell? Isn't it likely that something less bodily might play a role in our feelings of loss? And if the limbic system is equally affected by voice and appetite, wouldn't we feel the same deep limbic grieving over the loss of some particular food? With each brain part responsible for so many behavioral problems, doesn't fixing one cause others?  <BR> <BR>I wonder if we actually learn something by blaming behavior on some particular part of the brain, or if we are just taking well-recognized problems and relabeling them. There would be a point to all this if it led to new understanding or therapy. In fact, after doing much work to demonstrate the power of functional brain imaging to diagnose behavioral problems, the doctor goes out of his way to dissuade people from using the technique. In fact, many of the therapies that he does recommend appear quite conventional (cognitive behavioral therapy, diet, exercise).  <BR> <BR>The book isn't really as married to the model as it purports. Although the framework is structured around this brain partition, the meat of the book consists mostly of stories that bear no relationship to it, and branch out into new theories that are not given any other theoretical basis. Are we still pulling out the old hackney that Mozart is good for you? I've heard it makes your plants grow.  <BR> <BR>The tendency to view psychopathology in terms of a simplistic unidirectional chemical causality shows when the author unambiguously states that depression is caused by a neurotransmitter deficit. But this is either false or completely irrelevant. When somebody becomes depressed over the death of a loved one, the external event quite obviously must have something to do with this.  <BR> <BR>I'm not saying that there is no connection between brain and behavior. But the book appears to completely disallow the possibility that rather than being slaves to uncontrollable chemical imbalances, brain chemistry could itself at least partially be a reflection of our behavior. Perhaps the psychological-physiological dichotomy is a false one and both are aspects of the same thing, like the wave-particle duality of matter.  <BR> <BR>The book does have some useful things to say about the various medications that are in use. The anecdotes if anything are interesting, as are the brain scan images (those of addicts in particular are downright scary).  <BR> <BR>If the book purports to have a scientific basis, it would have benefited from a much more extensive set of references to support some of its claims. Psychology is a tough nut to crack, and there is still a tremendous amount of research ongoing to understand how our brain works. In the meantime, the field is open for anybody with a pet theory to claim they have the answers.	2002-09-04

The theory itself is fascinating, and it is strangely unfathomable how its application equated to the ability to quantitatively `trade risk'. Lowenstein has a fine knack of translating the numbers and financial machinery into real-world concepts so that the financial markets actually begin to make sense.  <BR> <BR>Although he appears to conclude that flaws in the scientific theory were the ultimate cause of its collapse, it is my opinion that this is not strictly speaking true. It is well-known in science (and more so in the empirical ones) that every theory has its domain of applicability outside of which it cannot be simply assumed to be equally accurate.  <BR> <BR>What I believe caused LTCM to collapse was the failure by those who applied the theory to test carefully to what extent it could be stretched before a more sophisticated refined version was needed to complement it. The sheer greed inspired by the theory's early success caused LTCM's managers to wilfully ignore warnings from underlings and throw all caution to the wind, as they expanded into ever and ever riskier trades.  <BR> <BR>The unheard-of use of borrowing exacerbated what might otherwise have been a manageable business failure. LTCM was able to obtain astronomical amounts of money by leveraging off the greed of its lenders. Lowenstein also hints that the moral hazard of the Fed acting as an `insurer of last resort' allows traders to take wild risks with our economy.  <BR> <BR>All in all, a very interesting, exciting, and readable account of hubris.	2002-09-03

Corruption of power in the Church has apparently a certain tradition, as evidenced by the inclusion by Medieval painters of images of the Pope burning in Hell. Sin by sin, Wills picks apart some of the fallacies on which modern Church doctrine is built, descending into detail to reveal their intellectually flimsy and ludicrously tenuous basis.  <BR> <BR>The power struggles at the very top of the hierarchy, and the lengths to which it goes to bend its own dogma to plaster over its past errors are to me strangely reminiscent of a similar self-protective autocracy of the Soviet Union which could stretch the infamous Article 58 to justify any kind of misbehavior. With disappearances of reports and committees that refuse to toe to the papal line, the book paints an institution that is much more concerned with power and control over the thoughts and deeds of its members than with their spiritual salvation.  <BR> <BR>It is not that difficult to understand why the Church is losing this control. Science begins almost from the standpoint of being wrong, and pours all its efforts and energies into continually correcting itself so that it becomes more True in time. The Catholic Church, on the other hand, starts with the premise of infallibility so every new papal proclamation or encyclical can only serve to add error into its dogma. Whereas Science is forward-looking, the Church becomes more and more preoccupied with the rearrangement of the internal inconsistencies of its past. The growing refusal of the laity (and even the priesthood) to endure self-serving reasoning on topics such as contraception, the status of women and homosexuals, or papal authority itself, simply reflects this tension.  <BR> <BR>The priesthood is changing face, as fewer train to become priests and heterosexual priests resign in droves, reporting seminaries that are almost three-quarters homosexual. The rate of death due to HIV/AIDS in the priesthood is four to eight times that of the general population, and one survey of priests reported an average of 226 sexual partners each. The failure of the Church to come to terms with this reality is further evidence of its disconnect from reality.  <BR> <BR>Wills reveals some rot also in the lower hierarchies of the Church, with priests easily covering up the most grotesque betrayals of their flock. In the name of their religion they condemn the victim and exonerate the abuser.  <BR> <BR>Another instance of this dishonesty (Wills gives many) is the manner in which Pope John Paul II acquits the Catholic Church for its treatment of Jews throughout history, in particular in World War II and the kidnapping of Jewish children in the late 19th century, letting itself off the hook on the legalistic technicality that any discrimination that may have occurred goes against Christian teaching, and is therefore by definition not perpetrated by Catholics. Adding insult to injury, there are now convents established at the very concentration camps where the horrors of the Holocaust took place.  <BR> <BR>At the conclusion of the book, it is not at all surprising to me why Wills found it necessary later to write a justification of his Catholicism, as I wonder how the edifice of the Catholic Church still bears the weight of its followers' trust. Wills hearkens back to a quite different kind of Catholicism practiced by Augustine, whom he clearly admires.  <BR> <BR>The book is at times quite technical. Certainly the Greek, Latin, and Catholic jargon make hard reading for this atheist, although it is likely to be more meaningful to someone brought up in the Catholic terminology. Nevertheless, it is an heroic effort and well worth reading.	2002-09-01

One, obviously, painstakingly researched, every detail checked, rechecked, and then checked again. It is unfortunate then, that the extent of research for We'll Meet Again appears to be limited to a Connecticut state travel guide.<br /><br />Although the author may be known as a mystery writer, this book is much less a mystery than a fawning description of the New England aristocracy that she most likely yearns for. A world in which coffee is drunk from \\"demitasse cups,\\" live-in cooks are named Pedro, and which is populated by \\"attractive and socially desirable women.\\" One of sterile emotion and flat character. A world that she is eager to demonstrate her knowledge of in the most insipid detail. There are so many references to Interstate 95 and the Merritt parkway that one would hardly deny that Ms Clark must be intimately familiar with them.<br /><br />It seems that MHC has a love affair with adjectives. What, really, is a \\"generous view,\\" and how exactly are \\"Virginia ham and Swiss cheese removed from a refrigerator with careful pleasure\\"? Please! The \\"dried-up\\" and \\"tearless\\" tautologies become \\"instantly arid\\". Then there are these flourishing gems of literary style: \\"His prodigious memory bank instantly furnished the facts he was seeking.\\" In other words, he remembered? Or heart-rending emotion: \\"It was as though the entire time had been simply a dream sequence. Dream? No- nightmare!\\" Good grief! Could she possibly have been conscious of the delicious irony in naming her television station NAF TV? And what about the obsession with trivialities, such as the precise manner in which these socialites \\"throw the rest of a sandwich in the compactor.\\" Who cares?<br /><br />But enough, because criticizing the literary style of MHC is like shooting fish in a barrel. Unfortunately the story itself is sparse and confused, and eminently comical. Sadistic doctors and evil HMOs are engaged in a conspiracy to kill expensive patients, and when the murder of one of the doctors is witnessed by his wife, she develops amnesia and is convicted of the crime. I can't believe anyone would have the gall to use the amnesia ploy again, but there you have it, MHC is pushing the boundaries of literature- right down the toilet.<br /><br />A complete waste of time, unless you happen to live in Madison, Connecticut (where it ranks fourteenth in sales by Amazon), or if you like I-95.ately the story itself is sparse and confused, and eminently comical.

For somebody with no background in the history of the region, the author does a nice job of setting up the context, so that the ensuing gripping day-by-day account of the war makes sense.  <BR> <BR>The war could only have happened because of the betrayal by the United Nations, whose peacekeeping force was stationed on the Egyptian border. When Egypt requested the peacekeepers to make way for their advance, UNEF withdrew all its forces within a lightning-quick two days so that Israel was suddenly open to surprise attack.  <BR> <BR>Because the book culls from Western, Arab, and Soviet sources it offers a very complete perspective on the events of the War. For example, we learn that the Arab forces' humiliating defeat was partially due to belief in their own propaganda, which told only of glorious victories.  <BR> <BR>Another point of interest to me was that while the Arab nations relied on and were promised Soviet support for their offensive, the Soviets were so intimidated by the possibility of American involvement that theirs remained limited to providing Arab forces with weaponry. As it was, the main material support we offered in the conflict were the Patton tanks for the Jordanian army.  <BR> <BR>Almost anecdotally, Oren recalls an incident in which a cell headed by Yasser Arafat was foiled from launching a terror attack. The interesting thing is that this took place before the War, when the Palestinians were still ruled by Jordan.  <BR> <BR>I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about the birthplace of terror.	2002-08-22

Although it makes some attempts at covering its subject, in my opinion it suffers from being poorly written, its almost lackadaisical style, and a failure to properly introduce and explain concepts. For example, the reader is bombarded in the first chapter by Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, Left and Right SRs, New Style, with hardly a clue as to their meaning and historical significance. Worse, analysis is lacking or flawed. Its perpetuation of the mischaracterization of the coup of October 1917 as a 'revolution' is indefensible in light of information that has long been available to Western historians. In addition, its poor typography and lack of overall structure make its reading an ordeal.  <BR> <BR>All in all, I would suggest someone who is seeking a good overview and introduction to the history of the Soviet Union to look elsewhere.	2002-08-04

Although, as its subtitle indicates, it isn't intended as a complete historical overview of communist states, it does a very good job of introducing them to a reader who is only vaguely familiar with their reality. The book is organized geographically into parts written by authors who obviously know their respective specialties, although the fact that so many authors contributed to it leads it to suffer just a little from a lack of cohesion (structure and narrative style, presence of bibliographies). In my opinion, the first part on the Soviet Union is excellent-- the parts on Western European, Eastern European, Asian, and Third-World communism are also highly informative.<br /><br />I would certainly recommend this without reservation to anyone with an interest in understanding the practice of communism, regardless of their historical background.	2002-08-04

Having won the author a Nobel prize for Literature, I half expected some unapproachably haughty Kunderesque crypto-novel, but nothing could be farther from the truth. Archipelag Gulag is the 'island chain' of the concentration camps that streched throughout the most remote and uninhabitable regions of the Soviet Union. Through his own eyes, and those of 227 fellow survivors, he relates in a deeply sarcastic yet sympathetic way the movement and experience of the individual through the system with such beauty and so completely that one feels one can almost begin to understand. One suspects that his sense for black humor must have helped him survive. I was relieved not to find here any simpering gushy 'forgiveness' of his opressors-- Solzhenitsyn knows them and understands how they were able to exact such terror, and he fully holds them accountable.  <BR> <BR>I would most emphatically persuade you to read this.	2002-08-04
US	50429756	R3HX28RFWPVCKO	0553271989	424077500	The Odessa File	Books	5	7	9	N	N	Tremendous	Thankfully there are writers like Frederick Forsyth, all of whose books are captivating. His novels are placed realistically in a developed historical context, so there is a real possibility of actually learning something from reading them. He has a knack for melding his fiction into this context, so that it is often hard to tell one from the other. The edition I read (not the one pictured here) had a note from the publisher saying that they intentionally would not clarify the distinction, with the one exception of affirming that the person of Eduard Roschmann did in fact exist. Presumably we would not have believed that the disgusting horrors attributed to this officer of the SS could in fact have been committed.  <BR> <BR>Because, obliquely, The Odessa File is a novel about the German SS (and to a lesser extent, the Arab-Israeli conflict) as seen through the eyes of a young German reporter of the post-WWII generation. It is so refreshing that Forsyth does not permit himself the usual gross characterizations, instead indicating distinctions in the acts of the SS, the German Wehrmacht, and Latvian collaborators. At the same time, it is not an historical novel per se. There is a palpitating story that takes place in the early sixties, that unfolds surely, without dwelling or stalling, before coming to a dramatic close. But again, the story, surreptitously, brings one that much closer to beginning to understand how the horrors of the Second World War might have happened.  <BR> <BR>It is hard to appreciate just how much research must have gone into the writing, as Mr Forsyth calls seemingly effortlessly on details of geography, history, language, the German political system, culture, automobiles, and weaponry. It is in some way similar to Tom Clancy's style, except that Forsyth's knowledge extends beyond weaponry alone and it is not what the novel is about. The detail is all beautifully woven into the story and contributes to it.  <BR> <BR>This truly is one of those books that will be very hard to put down.	2002-08-04

Oscar Wilde, after reading whose novel and two fairy tales, quickly obviates any further need or desire to be further acquainted. The knowledge found on the cover of my paperback edition, between the obligatory sickly hagiography that usually betrays the expectation it inspires, that The Picture of Dorian Gray was apparently the author's only fruitful attempt at a `full-length' novel, leaves one snickering ante facto in not entirely facetious gratitude. Wilde was seemingly more at home in the realm of fairy tales, and this 217-page full-length novel not by itself finding ground to fill the space between the covers, finds itself supported by three samples of that genre.<br /><br />One might be forgiven for assuming that the novel portends to explore an emotional or philosophical metaphor of a relationship between the eponymous painting and its subject, but the implied exploration is unfortunately mostly specious. The metaphor, to be sure, is there, but it is a mere seed that never takes root or grows out of its entirely obvious and superficial form, and the story thus fails to fulfil its promise.<br /><br />Furthermore, the filling leaves one with a bad aftertaste. None of the three characters have any endearing features to redeem themselves for the gall they otherwise freely spew. `Lord Henry' in particular has no characterizing dimension other than denigration of everything else in the form of dull pseudowitticisms, from which comparison we take it the aristocrat was intended to benefit. We learn his contempt of clergy (bishops \\"don't think\\"), stockbrokers (\\"even a stock-broker can gain a reputation for being civilized\\"), dowagers (they are \\"overdressed\\"), academicians (tedious), the middle class (not modern), Americans, marriage, women, and Jews (I don't believe any mention of the religion ever lacks the adjective \\"fat\\"). The misogyny in particular is so pungent and the female characters so weak that the protagonists cannot otherwise but treat them with the contempt that they do. If indeed \\"women are decorative\\" it is merely because the men do not have a vision that sees beyond superficialities. This is no parody of aristocratic vanity (in the style of Thackeray, for instance) so one quickly finds oneself wishing for one of these maligned targets of Lord Henry's dull wit to return the favor with a dull but well-deserved kick in the [rump].<br /><br />When the characters are not railing against the world, they are theorizing about it, but the obvious inconsistencies and utter inanity of the theories make them impossible to consider seriously. To give an example, and not have one character take the brunt of all the book's failings, the artist Basil Hallward states first (speaking of his own work) that \\"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not the sitter,\\" but six pages later that \\"an artist should create beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them.\\" A story dealing ostentatiously with a profound relationship between ars and artis, in which the artist doesn't remember from one moment to the next whether or not he put feeling in his art, reveals that its author has lost control of his subject. Othertimes the theories are merely silly and quite impossible to take at face value. What to make, for example, of the idea that \\"beauty is a form of genius- is higher, indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation,\\" or that \\"people say sometimes that beauty is superficial. That may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is.\\" This is just tripe without considerable meaning.<br /><br />Within this theorizing there are faint reverberations reaching toward some oblique philosophy of hedonism, but never quite advancing beyond a mere slogan. Without actually doing the work of fully expounding the philosophy, or having the courage to fully sound its implications, in the way that for example de Sade did, the author cannot reasonably expect us to sympathize or find the actions of his characters anything but wholly unsatisfying and their reactions rather balmy.<br /><br />Wilde quite clearly has no desire (charitably assuming it is not from a lack of potential) to prepare and construct a plot. One of the adjunct characters, Jim, whose sister Sibyl later commits suicide over the protagonist, finds out he is a bastard son, his mother was orphaned, and forgives her (what for, we are left to guess), all within the space of three quarter page. Dorian's swings of attitude toward Sybil from ignorance through love through despisement through sorrow to self-forgiveness are so extreme and irrational that they make a pastiche of emotion. Jim's completely unfounded anger toward Dorian is so unrealistically sudden and out of proportion that it is obvious how Jim's fears will be realized and that there will be a confrontation. There is no mystery, less a sense of a world to discover than of being dragged along by an uninterested parent. The rhetorical questions Dorian asks in his histrionic despair are answered immediately, it is for me simply to get in, sit down, shut up, and hold on.<br /><br />Even more fundamentally, the characters are shallow, undeveloped, and quite stereotypical, the dialog stilted and unrealistic- altogether a surprisingly unsophisticated style, especially in the light of the beautiful writing of his contemporaries. Dialog has a tendency to spin off into unrelated tangents that are unceremoniously and artificially `snapped back' to the main thread. Henry's inability to speak in any other form than witless aphorism is at first merely unfunny, then quickly boring, later irritating, and finally not bearing further reading. And this is unfortunately barely the only character development in the story at all, the only other characters having little strength of will of their own to resist mimicking this trite ascerbicism.<br /><br />If the book has revealed anything at all, it is not a deeper analysis of art or hedonism, but a much more animal homoeroticism. Dorian Gray is much more than anything else a love story with the trimmings (envy and a murder-suicide), and all the less respectful because it dares not speak its name. Female emotions are contemptible, but the same expressions of liking (Wilde can never bring himself to call it more), admiration of beauty, and extreme flattery by men towards other men, are accepted naturally and not subject to this contempt.ourage to fully sound its implications, in the way that for example de Sade did, the author cannot reasonably expect us to sympathize or find the actions of his characters anything but wholly unsatisfying and their reactions rather balmy.  <BR> <BR>Wilde quite clearly has no desire (charitably assuming it is not from a lack of potential) to prepare and construct a plot.

US	50429756	RFWKKFSFAL88I	0133510980	284597835	The Gentle Art of Verbal Self-defence	Books	1	28	79	N	N	Completely Worthless	I guess just about *anyone* can get a book published nowadays.  The author clearly has no understanding at all of rhetoric outside of her own personal experience of having been insulted-- which I imagine must happen quite often.  Essentially the entire book is centered around providing canned responses to eight verbal attacks, and arranging them in an 'octagon'.  Why this arrangement is preferable to any other, or what is to be gained by any sort of arrangement, remains unexplained.  The one thing I do recommend in this book is the (presumably unintentional) humorous maternalistic tone that seeps through when the author writes about the protection that her fragile women need from strong, angry men... very funny indeed.  If you really are looking for a book that will teach you something, rather than give quick and empty entertainment, try &quot;Logical Self-Defense&quot; by Johnson and Blair.  I haven't finished it yet, but they are obviously on a whole different level than Elgin.	2001-03-21
