I couldn't put it down (read the whole thing in a single afternoon!). Amazing chemistry between the hero and heroine, and I just adored the heroine. She was strong and real without being shrill or TSTL (as so many of them are). Loved her. Loved her. Loved her. If more romances were as good as this one, I'd get to post a lot more reviews.	2005-09-28

I wasn't mislead. If you like sassy, won't-take-no-for-an-answer heroines, then you'll love Bobbie. And if you like hunky bad-boys (and I do!) then you'll like Nick even more. <br /> <br />I simply like the heroine's pluck. She's not gonna let her ex dump her and make her miserable, she's gonna reinvent herself and make him drool! I can't wait to track down the author's ebooks. I've never bought an ebook, but for this author, I'm willing to go where I've never gone before . . . <br /> <br />The book was a TOP PICK in last month's Romantic Times Magazine (which I'm also addicted to), and now I know why. <br /> <br />	2004-12-28

It starts off a bit slow, but once I got a few chapters in, I was hooked. I simply love the fact the CH writes books about PEOPLE. They seem real. They have fallacies, and problems, and inconvenient personality quirks. They fall in love with the wrong people (and sometimes, with the right people). They are motivated out of fear, greed, hatred, hurt feelings, as well as love, honor, and duty.  <br /> <br />All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and I HIGHLY recommend it. If you want a manly hero (with a bit of a soft, marshmallow center) and a heroine who is strong-willed and demonstrably not of the \\"too dumb to live\\" variety, then this book is for you. <br />	2004-12-15

PS's writing is crisp and clean, her dialogue flows naturally, and her characters (for all that they're otherworldly) are REAL. I simply loved the heroine, Rae, and the hero was perfect. This one goes on my keeper shelf. <br /> <br />Can't wait for the next one in the series! <br />	2004-12-09

Something about them just resonated, though. Few books give me that tight sternum breathless feeling, but this one did. Other reviewers have complained of a lack of emotional depth, but I found just the opposite with this book. It really spoke to me. I've already reread it once, and it has a permanent place on my keeper shelf. The writing wasn't the strongest, but the characters just sang. I'll certainly be buying her next book.	2004-12-01

She packs a whalop, no getting around it. Her dialogue is stiff, and her characters have long, dry, unnatural conversations (in which she refuses to use contractions, so everyone says \\"do not\\" and \\"can not\\" which always bothers me), and the child is overly precocious (not her musical ability, but the way she speaks), but it was worth the couple of hours I spent on it. Can't wait to track down Guilty Pleasures.	2004-10-12

Wonderful characters. They're very real, and you LIKE them. You want things to work out for them (or not, in the case of the villains, who are marvelously nasty, in a believable fashion).  <br /> <br />On the down side: Heroine's \\"magical\\" relationship with horses. Ick. I'd SOOOOOOOOOO much rather read about someone who was simply good at what she does. A gifted trainer. Not a \\"GIFTED\\" trainer. I want my heroine to be competent, not supernaturally talented (or at least WARN me that I'm wading into the shallow end of the paranormal pond before I buy the book). As if the heroine's \\"abilities\\" weren't enough, we also get a horse that is part bloodhound, and can track down other horses on command! I kid you not. I couldn't stop snickering. And then you get generally bad horse care from people who are supposed to know better: if your horse is gashed open and requires stitches, you don't wait all night in a crofter's cottage before having the gash attended to, it's too late to stitch it then.   <br /> <br />If the utterly ridiculous aspects of the heroine and her tracking horse don't repulse you, it's an ok read. If (like me) you find yourself irritated by supernatural overtones in a book that was sold as an historical romance, then skip this one. <br />	2004-09-27

It's a very convoluted story, with multiple marriages (one of which would have been illegal, so it was rather silly to threaten the heroine with it in the first place). I really liked the hero, but the author doesn't seem to have a grasp on how primogeniture works, or on how titles descend, which bugged me. He couldn't be disinherited by his father, and he couldn't renounce the title. He could choose not to use it, but he couldn't bestow it on his brother. Simply didn't work that way. Yet another case of the writer bending history to suit her story line . . . I was also really put off by the heroine's father. He vacillates from loving dad to abuser who rules with an iron fist and back again so many times it made my head spin. <br /> <br />I won't say don't buy it, but I also can't really recommend it. I certainly won't be buying anything else by this author.  <br />	2004-09-13

This is the second book by Maxwell that I've read, and she's certainly going to remain a prominent feature on my \\"to buy\\" list. If you're looking for a well written, entertaining story with characters who are fully realized and not merely cardboard cutouts, I highly recommend you pick this novel up.  <br /> <br />The heroine (Isabel) is strong and sure of herself (even when she shouldn't be, as she realizes as she grows and develops during the novel's progression). The hero (Michael) is fabulous, a real charmer (in the good sense). I love a reformed bad boy. Especially one who reformed himself . . .  <br /> <br />Even the titular bad guy in this novel (Riggs) has serious potential as a hero for a future novel. It's so refreshing when the secondary characters have enough life of their own that you find yourself wondering what they're up to when they're not front and center in the story. <br /> <br />The story I'm looking forward to is that of the hero's best friend Alex. Being half Native American myself, I usually cringe when I see novels with buff \\"Braves\\" on the cover, but for Alex I'm willing to make an exception. <br />	2004-09-13

The writing is superior, the story was gripping, and the plot is not at all stale (as you would have expected from yet another \\"secret baby\\" book). I was especially gratified to see that she really understood the close relationship Scotland and France shared, and worked it nicely into her plot. If you're looking for a new writer (and I always am) I highly recommend this book.	2004-08-24

I simply loved the first book in this series, but this one was a huge disappointment. The whole book takes place in a 48hr period, and Merry sleeps with so many people I'd have to use spread sheets to keep track of them all. To top it all off, all that sex isn't even interesting to read! I like a hot love scene as much as the next girl, but these orgy scenes are just plain boring. How can that be, you ask? I don't know. I just know that they are stultifyingly bland, and completely unsatisfying.  I skimmed/flipped past them, just wanting to find out what was going to happen to the characters, but was irritated that only about a third of the book is devoted to STORY, and the other two-thirds is nothing but really gratuitous sex scenes. Don't get me wrong, I'm not opposed to any of the stuff the characters are doing, and I'm certainly not offended, but when there's that much \\"action\\" going on, I shouldn't be yawning. I feel vaguely ripped off. This wasn't even really a whole book. It was more a transitional few chapters that lead from book two to book four, padded out with a  lot of bad sex so that the publisher could justify charging us all twenty-something dollars for Hamilton's new \\"book\\" and keep her publishing schedule. I'd already given up on the Anita Blake books before I bought this latest entry in the Faire series, and now I think I'm done with these folks' story too. It's sad really, cause these could be really great books, but instead they're turning into bland Goth-porn.	2004-08-19

First the good stuff: this book is SO WELL WRITTEN! It was simply a joy to read. The pages just flew by, and there was (almost) never any dialogue that stood out as impossibly wordy. The characters don't do stupid things, and they don't have stupid fights. It's all very real. I do wish she hadn't crammed three romances into one book (esp. when I think the other two couples really could have filled their own books!), but they're her stories, and if she wants to rush through them, well that's her business. I did get hung up on the idea that the hero (who is a nobleman) could just adopt his illegitimate son and make him his heir. Primogeniture--and period English law--doesn't work that way. The only possilbe way they'd be allowed to do this is to petition the crown to name the \\"adopted\\" son the heir, and even then the chances would be slim. There would have to be no legitimate heir (no other sons, and no male heirs in any junior branch of the family), and the King would have to think it was a good idea (when if he didn't aprove it, the money and land would revert to the crown). I know most modern readers will be happy with the ending, but it's not an historically \\"true\\" (or possible) ending, and it bothered me. In spite of this, I highly recommend this book, and I'll be ordering her first, and eagerly awaiting the next one!	2004-08-16

I was set to give up on the entire romance genre when I bought this book, and thank goodness I did! The writing is stellar, the story is fabulous, and it's just the kind of story I like best (it's about people and their relationships, not about a murder, or some stupid mystery that I never can get worked up about).         Lately I've bought a lot of stinkers (see my other reviews if you want to know what I'm talking about), but this book was worth every penny and every minute I spent on it. I read it cover to cover in one sitting! I won't go into the story (as the other reviews have taken care of that quite thoroughly), but I will say that the hero is wonderful (sexy, and a good guy at heart), the heroine is a delight (strong and smart without being a pain), and that I loved the way the author handled the gay almost-fiance (who gets his own happy ending!).        Thank you Ms. Jeffries for giving me a great read, and restoring my belief that there is still a market for books with correct period details.	2004-07-30

Stephen Ozment is my favorite historian, and this is my favorite of his books (closely followed by Three Behaim Boys). The story of Anna, both the love story and the tragedy of her later life, are fascinating. Ozment has a talent for making history real, present, and accessible, and this book is a shining example of what an in-depth historical study can be. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in 16th century history, women's history, or the history of law.	2004-07-22

It's also an EXTREMELY dry read. The book is quite obviously a doctoral dissertation, and could have used an edit to made it more accessible (something more along the lines of Stephen Ozment's books). I'm glad I read it. I tracked it down because I wanted to see just how accurate the movie Dangerous Beauty--which is LOOSELY based on this book--was. The answer is: Not very. Oh well. For those of a scholarly bent, this is a great resource book, for those looking for a light, romantic read (a la the movie) look elsewhere.	2004-07-22

This book is an interesting (if slightly dry) novel that explains a lot about ciphers and code breaking during this period. I found it fascinating.

I'm a huge Cornwell fan (and he's not &quot;relatively unknown&quot;; he's huge, hardback releases and all). I've read almost everything he's ever written, so it was nice to find a reissue of this book he co-wrote with his wife. He's most famous for his novels about the 95th Rifles and Richard Sharpe, but his Arthurian novels are also wonderful (why they didn't opt them for the stinker KING AUTHER movie that just came out I'll never understand).      A Crowning Mercy is not a romance novel per se (male fans need not be worried), but it's far more along those lines than his other novels. It has high adventure (a Cornwell staple), war (another hallmark), and a wonderful, well developed love story (something that is usually left well in the background of his novels). Cornwell himself says this is the best of the three he and his wife co-wrote, so I'll probably skip the others, but I'm glad I bought this one.	2004-07-22

I won?t go into detail, as that would ruin the whole book, but let me simply state that I thought the ending was implausible and unearned (and unsatisfactory).

As usual, I loved it. Evonovich simply has such a wonderful voice. Her characters are REAL, and funny at the same time. My only quibble (the reason this didn't get 5 stars) is that the story didn?t seem to be done when the book ended. It ends with a bang, and I wanted another chapter to unwind in. I needed to sit with Stephanie and Morelli on the couch, and get drooled on by Bob a bit. I needed to drop another wildly inappropriate food into the hamster cage.

Great things could have been done with the premise, but they weren?t. Perhaps I'm in the minority, but I like historical accuracy in my historical romances. The idea of a mistress (at least the mistress of anyone less than a royal duke, anyway) being included in ton parties is ludicrous, as is the heroine's fretting about her reputation. What reputation? She's someone's acknowledged mistress! She has no reputation. So, over all, not a bad book, but not a keeper either.	2004-07-21

I got 350 pages into it before I allowed myself to give up. I have multiple friends who simply love this whole series, but I was bored out of my mind. It goes on, and on, and on, and I just don?t care about any of these people. Plus it's supposed to be set in the 18th century, but the setting seems much more medieval. The Scots were not this backwards! Most of the reviews gush about the lush detail and historical accuracy. She can't even get the clothes right. It might have made a decent 300-400 page book, but there simply wasn't enough there to carry it for 800+ pages (let alone multiple installments of 800+ pages).

This one was well written, and an engaging read, but ultimately a little flat. I was also slightly put off by the semi-rape/forced sex encounter. The heroine got into it quickly, but I still found it distasteful. It was very 70s romance novel, and not what I'm looking for in a love scene.

I'm giving it a 4 (when the story is really a 3) just because the language is so wonderful. I was a little put off by the heavy handed use of similes, and the last third of the book is--sadly--a travesty. I won't explain why (as it would ruin the story) but be aware: Things get extremely melodramatic and the dialogue (which up until then had seemed genuine) becomes over-blown. I would also like to have known more specifically when the book was set. Unlike lots of other reviewers I simply adored the silk and lace the hero wore (it's period, and well described; put me forcibly in mind of some of Heyer's Georgian heroes). The men's costumes (as described) could be anywhere from the 1730s-1770s, but the women seem to be wearing late 1780s-early 1790s (as her pannier are out of fashion). Also: corsets/stays of the period do NOT hook! They are spiral laced. This major fashion glitch is irritating (though at least the heroine is wearing a corset!). All in all, well worth the evening I spent reading it, and I will be buying the follow up book, \\"The Wicked Lover.\\"	2004-05-26

Loved Theresa and were really bummed out when she died? Need a great socking stuffer or Easter basket item? This is for you!!! I ordered copies for all my friends, and we all enjoyed it. It's a quick read (only 60+ pages), but I'll buy more if they're published.	2002-12-23

Arturo Perez-Reverte is one of my favorite writers, and I've devoured all of his other books, but this one is just a chore to get through. It's not that the story isn't interesting, because it is, it's that the language is dead. The writing just isn't as enthralling as the past works have been. My only consolation is that this flaw seems attributable to the translator, not the author. I'll certainly steer clear of any future works translated by Margaret Sayers Peden, and I'll live in hope that none of his other books will be handled by her.	2001-11-09

Depressing. How can anyone in the historical romance genre even contemplate writing a book in which the country miss meets the rakish anti-hero while picking blackberries. A wonderful setting if you think your audience hasn't read Heyer (but most of us have). If you are even contemplating buying this book, take my advice and find a copy of Venetia instead. I guess I?ll just have to wait for new Cynster book to enjoy Laurens again.	2001-05-14
