A lot of people wanted that sword for a lot of reasons. <br />  <br />The young monk who takes it for them is unobtrusive enough but, as rumour of what he is carrying spreads, he is in danger. The companions he picks up on the way, a formidable Prioress, a Crusader haunted by the massacre in the Holy Land, may be trustworthy, or they may not.  <br />  <br />The king they are seeking, Henry II, is sick so they are not only evading enemies, they are also in a race against time.  <br />  <br />KING OF THE LAST DAYS makes a story full of sharp medieval detail, and lively wit and variety of mood. A very satisfying and immensely readable successor to Diana Norman's first novel, Fitzempress' Law.\\"  <br />	2005-07-13

One love scene goes on for 30+ pages but it dragged so much that it felt like 60.

US	51876301	R6EG0WQMRNITS	0759943109	499730842	Mozart's Wife	Books	5	5	6	N	N	musical genius from another point of view	It's not a romance book but does tell the love story of Mozart for his darling little wife and of Stanzi Marini for him. It also takes you back to Germany, Austria and Prague in the 18th century to watch the trials their love undergoes, the bitter jealousies, the constant worries about bills and money, the heartbreak of losing four of their six children and the horrible toll on Constanza's health. She's been alternately reviled as a woman who wasn't worthy of her genius husband and praised for her efforts to ensure that his musical legacy lives to this day.  <br /> <br />Waldron's book shows a middle ground probably closer to the truth. It also immerses the reader in the day to day struggle to survive in those times and offers another <br />possibility to explain Mozart's mysterious death and burial. I like that neither <br />Mozart nor Constanza is turned into a villain and both their strengths and weaknesses are presented. Details of daily life and of the two leads show Waldron's years of research. Though it's not a feel good book with a HEA, I thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent reading it while playing Mozart's immortal music as a background accompaniment.	2005-03-20

A British officer attempts to force her to marry him but man she's recently been introduced to at a <br />ball comes <br />to her rescue and together they set out to return her to her home. <br />But to get <br />there, they will have to brave brigands, bandits, the British, the <br />loyalists, <br />the patriots, the Indians and each other. It's quite a journey. <br /> <br />If you like very detailed historical novels, road romances, and war <br />stories <br />then <br />Independent Heart might be for you. Angelica is a woman of common <br />sense <br />and bravery who falters only rarely under immense strains and <br />pressures. Jack <br />Church is the mystery of the story and we see many sides to him and <br />learn <br />about him when and as Angelica does. Is he the civilian we first <br />meet? The <br />younger son looking for land of his own and with family ties in the <br />area? <br />The former cavalryman who is no stranger to dirty fights and killing? <br />Or <br />someone else altogether? And when Angelica finally discovers who he <br />really is, can she forgive enough for them to find a future? If they <br />even <br />manage <br />to survive the savage frontier fighting that rages all along the <br />Hudson <br />River. <br /> <br />Waldron has a slightly old fashioned style of writing. At times <br />flowery, <br />slightly emotional at others, down to earth and blunt when needed. <br />It's <br />also clear she's done her research which is threaded through the story <br />and not dumped in heaps on the reader's head. <br />Parts of it aren't pretty but then civil wars (and that's what the <br />American <br />Revolution was at times) never are. <br /> <br />Independent Heart isn't without flaws but for a different view of <br />that War, <br />I highly recommend it. FYI, the love scenes are restrained. <br /> <br />	2005-03-20

It was fascinating. I learned (and sadly haven't really retained) all kinds of info on rock formations, evolution, and paleontology. When I read the excerpts of this book a few months ago, I noted the author and bought the book when it came out. Novacek is a world famous paleontologist who takes us on a journey of his past field work and interweaves that with info on the animals whose bones he uncovers along with the geology of the sites he's worked. He also throws in some hilarious stories of adventures in fossil hunting that make me quite happy to stay home and leave the actual travels to him.  <br /> <br /> <br />\\"Time Traveler illuminates some of the most exciting issues in current paleontology-- dinosaur and mammal evolution, continental drift, mass extinctions, and new methods for understanding ancient environments and the geologic time scale. By revisiting our planet's past and his own, Novacek teaches us how to understand the prospects for the future not only of paleontology but of our global ecosystem.\\"  <br /> <br />I will say that if you only have a glancing interest in this type of material, this book would probably bore you to tears but if it's something that intrigues you, you might find it as fascinating as I did.  <br />  <br />	2004-12-16

If one husband died she was up for sale again. <br />Only the first of Matilda de Risle's husbands gives her anything <br />back. His is the customary Saxon morning gift -- the present to a <br />wife if her lord finds her sexually pleasing on their wedding night. <br />Matilda's morning gift was Dungesey in the Fens...\\"a bolt hole my, <br />dear somewhere to hide should trouble come.\\" And come it does. As the <br />war between King Stephen and Empress Matilda in the 1140s tears <br />England apart, Matilda de Risle has to fight for her land, her son's <br />safety--and her own life. Matilda, snobbish, bossy, inquisitive, <br />realistic, competitive, and tough, is at once a powerful and <br />endearing central character in Diana Norman's splendid new novel of <br />medieval English life. It is set in a barbarous civil war and <br />is by turns violent and very funny. Above all it fills the pages with <br />real people, with the scents of the Fens in all seasons, and tells in <br />the end a heartwrenching love story.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />This blurb really tells why I've enjoyed the two Diana Norman books <br />I've tried so far. The characters are real. Sometimes noble and <br />wonderful and sometimes pettish and jealous. You might get mad with <br />them but you can understand why they act as they do. She has a <br />delicious, subtle sense of humor which had me laughing out loud <br />several times. <br /> <br />Her research appears to be meticulous but is never hurled at us in <br />chunks just to prove she did it. Plus it's not too disgusting in <br />portraying medieval life. And I love the way she doesn't hit you over <br />the head and take you by the hand to lead you to these facts. She <br />also makes religion an integral part of the story. <br /> <br />Things which may put some people off. The heroine is fourteen when <br />the story starts, not unusual for medieval child brides. It spans a <br />20 year period of time. The heroine is married three times before she <br />finally hooks up with the hero. It's more a historical novel with a <br />romance threaded through it then a true romantic historical. <br /> <br />Finding out about life in the Fens, the marshland around Ely in <br />Cambridgeshire, was fascinating. How they lived, what they ate, how <br />they hunted and wove reeds to provide things needed for day to day <br />life. And watching the clash between Norman and Saxon showed how the <br />two sides were still settling in. It's a detailed snapshot <br />of the era and one I thoroughly enjoyed. A- <br /> <br />Here is the full sentence from which the blurb quote is taken: <br />\\"I just wanted, my dear, for you to have a bolthole, somewhere to <br />hide should trouble come, where you and our children will always be <br />safe and hidden and have plenty to eat. I know it seems an odd little <br />gift to you and it will take time to get used to its people--these <br />are the true English and nobody is odder than they--but I shall feel <br />happier that you have it.\\" <br /> <br />	2004-12-15

Treve is your typical cynical rake who's been wounded in love but he's also a man whose eyes show his sadness and longing for a wife and family of his own. Rebecca is a woman forced to seek out the biggest matrimonial fish she can land in order to pay her bills and keep the constable from the door. But she's also a woman who has known love in her family and marriage and longs for it again.  <br /> <br />Veryan does a great job with the secondary characters and if you love descriptions of Georgian style clothes then this is the book for you.  <br />	2004-12-15

Here's the back- blurb.  <br /> <br /> <br />\\"Lord Hanford of Laceby possessed an ancient lineage and even more ancient debts. He was, quite bluntly, for sale. Susannah Potter was in the market. She had recently inherited a tidy sum-and a host of odious fortune hunters. And so their marriage of convenience was made.\\" <br /> <br />Hanford has been raised in the belief that as the head of his family, he is responsible for not only his mother and younger siblings but for the estate and ancient name of Hanford. He's juggled debts and mortgages for six years to try to let the family stay in the lifestyle to which they were born but he's finally sold the last thing available except himself. Susannah is trying to dodge the marriage machinations of her aunt who covets Susannah's father's wealth and plans to get it by forcing her wastrel son on her.  <br /> <br />Both enter the marriage knowing it's not true love but a bargain from which each will get something-money and position. And it's a nice slow journey in which each learns something of the other's life and mindset. It's not easy and both have to make adjustments and overcome certain prejudices. There are great secondary characters and a nice romance for Susannah's delightfully blunt speaking sister and Hanford's brother-who learns a thing or two about Cits himself.  <br />  <br />	2004-12-15

Sophronia Tewksbury was a manipulative old bat and left her relatives with a mind boggling one. The entailed estate went to one nephew, various lesser jewels were given to others but her diamonds were to be buried with her. Outrage is the best description of their reaction to that news. Scheming sister Marcia, estate poor cousin Jonathon, marriage minded nephew Gabriel and ward Luane are all determined to get their hands on the necklace. But Marcia's neglected daughter Claudia just wants a few small adventures before heading back to her dreary life in Devonshire as the governess to her Uncle's bratty boys. Coexecutors of the will Sir Hillary Thoreau and Sophie's solicitor Mr. Fletcher will have their hands full trying to guard the grave, sort out the family squabbles and maybe, for Sir Hillary, find a little romance before all is sorted out.  <br /> <br />Joan Smith does wicked, witty trad regencies better than about anyone else. And with Claudia and Hillary she has her usual cutting comedy. Very little gets past either one and both have delicious senses of humor. Sir Hillary comes upon Cousin Jonathon trying to propose to Claudia and decides to give lessons.  <br /> <br /> <br />\\"Shall I show you how?\\" Sir Hillary asked. \\"Standing will do for a rehearsal, though in a real offer kneeling is all the crack. You take the lady's right hand---so. You had her left hand, Jonathon, the one with the emerald--didn't you notice? Next you assume a suitably ardent expression--a mixture of hope, love and eagerness with something of eternal devotion thrown in if you can manage it, but still firm and manly. Humility has no part in this particular expression. That will come later after she has accepted. I think the facial expression really half the battle. When my time comes I shall think of a particular trout that has eluded me these several seasons and imagine I am about to land him\\" <br /> <br />The secondary characters,especially Sophie's long suffering companion Miss Bliss and Marcia's upstart romantic suitor, are great and you get the regency feel but set in the countryside, so no tiresome trips to Almacks or harping on only two dances per gentleman per night. This one was delightful. <br />  <br />	2004-12-15

So often this threat is mentioned in books but rarely really shown. I also liked that the hero was a bad boy and not just a wannabe. But I also enjoyed the fact that Guhrke made him mischievous enough for me to still like instead of whinny and petulant and cold.  <br /> <br />I didn't have a problem with Isabel. She was obviously intelligent and had lived <br />a very unsheltered life so her cynicism and worldliness seemed OK to me.  <br />I enjoyed the way Grace dealt with her and the fact that Dylan didn't <br />immediately \\"take\\" to being a father. I thought his growth of feelings for <br />Isabel was well done.  <br /> <br />I also like that Dylan finally does realize just how much he hurt not only <br />Grace but also Isabel and every other woman he ever treated badly. And <br />that even in the end, he's still a little incorrigable and Grace sees and knows <br />this.  <br /> <br />The secondary characters are good and it's nice <br />that they just served this book and didn't rehash their own or jockey <br />for position to set up a future one.    <br /> <br />What I don't really understand is why she suddenly gives into a physical <br />relationship with him. She holds out and won't give in then does an about <br />face so quickly.  <br /> <br />But this is a minor quibble and overall I enjoyed His Every Kiss very much.	2004-12-15

But since I'd already bought it, I thought I might as <br />well give it a chance. I'm very glad I did. Paquet takes the familiar plot of a  <br />poor woman searching for a rich husband along with a stuffed shirt hero and <br />does something a little different with it. As the other reviewer says, this isn't <br />a novel of whacky happenings or one in which the heroine finds a rich man <br />at the beginning and they just have to work out that they are in love. The <br />romance between William and Sarah has more than one real obstacle <br />and both know it.  <br /> <br />I like that the author knows her regency manners and has her characters <br />follow them. But it's not done in a stuffy \\"see, I've done my research\\" <br />kind of way. I like that just when you think the heroine will turn out to <br />be feisty, she doesn't. Or that there are real reasons for her family's <br />oddball behavior. And that the hero has an excuse for being a bit <br />stuffy. Along with the fact that both are sadly practical about what <br />is expected of them and that they try to live up to family obligations. <br />Yes, I got a little impatient with Sarah's money-feckless family but <br />at least they were finally opening their eyes and acknowledging the <br />problem. William's brother is a jerk but then as so many say, who <br />says no to a Duke?  <br /> <br />I like that Paquet solves the problems without resorting to a sudden <br />death-leading-to-inheritance or complete brain/personality transplant. <br />The resolution is believable in both timing and action.  <br /> <br />The secondary characters are nice and have their place in the story.  <br />There is enough detail about them so that they aren't just place holders <br />and yet they don't take over the story or fight for recognition of their own <br />future book. An Honorable Match is a sweet, down to earth regency <br />that I'm glad I read. B <br />	2004-12-15

Handsome as sin, an astounding swordsman, and completely devoted to his own well-being and the pursuit of the easy life, Roland is a man who has made life difficult for others in the first 5 books of this series but he meets his match in Fiona Bradford, a pint sized dynamo. The man who has sneered at others who have fallen in love and who has sworn that no woman is worth more than a week of his time falls hopelessly in love. The whole series is about the treasure that was gathered from the supporters of Bonnie Prince Charlie and the attempts of one band of people to gather it together and move it to a safe place, all while hounded by the British military and civilian treasure-seekers, among whom is our hero. If caught, they will be tortured, tried and executed for high treason. Roland has sought the treasure for 5 books and now finds himself bound by his word of honor to help those who are trying to move it to a final safe place to await distribution back to those who gave it. Fiona, along with her father, grandmother and a small group of others, is one of those helping to move it.     Roland finds himself in a difficult position. He loves Fiona and knows that as a rake he is unworthy of her but thinks that his love for her might be enough to reform him. But he is a [...] who lives by his wits and who has been estranged from his grandfather and who despised his noble father. What does he have to offer her? And how can he convince her indomitable grandmother to approve his suit. Fiona is positive that this is the love she's waited for and refuses to listen to those who try to tell her that he will only break her heart.     This is a fun, and in places wittily funny book. It is also a swashbuckling adventure of the old school. In addition to the great primary romance, it has a wonderful secondary one between two characters from the 2nd book in the series, Journey to Enchantment. I have to admit to getting a little teary-eyed when Thaddeus Briley finally gets his lady. This is a fabulous series and one that I strongly recommend.	2004-12-15

Nevertheless, it <br />was there she went in a desperate attempt to provide her remaining <br />family with a place to live. <br />Having finagled Charle's reluctant agreement, Valentina concluded he <br />more than lived up to his disagreeable reputation. Still, there were <br />moments when she glimpsed another side of him and could not deny his <br />charm. Though rumours about her cousin's allegiance to England were <br />rife, Valentina became his staunch defender. <br />When Charles was finally apprehended and subsequently tried, the <br />result convinced her she had been right to have loved him all along. <br />She had refused to believe he would never come back or that he risked <br />his life to set her free.\\" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The title refers to the fact that the hero, Charles de Michel, is <br />half French and therefore during the Napoleon wars has a dubious <br />reputation in England. Tina goes to him in desperation looking for a <br />home for her family which has been left destitute by her dead <br />father's gambling debts. Reluctantly Charles agrees with the <br />provision that they begin restoring the decrepit family estate, <br />Wyenott Towers which Tina disparages upon first sight with the <br />comment, \\"Why not tear it down?\\" <br /> <br />But with no choice, she agrees to the bargain and the Ashford family <br />begins the arduous task of cleaning and repairing the long neglected <br />house. And learning about their mysterious cousin and his beloved <br />mama. But there is danger in the neighborhood as a highwayman <br />has been holding up the Royal Mail coach, the English countryside <br />is suspicious of all foreigners and de Michel has a personal enemy <br />who will stop at nothing to bring him down. <br /> <br />Veryan spices this one with her trademark humor and suspenseful <br />ending. The bantering between the hero and heroine is delightful and <br />Charles de Michel is as honorable a hero was Veryan has ever created. <br />But...there is a lot going on and a short page count in which to <br />resolve it. I think if this had been a longer book, the ending would <br />have felt less rushed. There is also a slight deus ex machina plot <br />twist that helps the hero out of a tight spot plus a separation of the <br />hero and heroine that I didn't care for. Overall, I liked it but it's <br />not quite up to Veryan's longer Georgian books.	2004-12-15

No, Lady Elizabeth does not behave like a \\"feisty\\" heroine all the time, snapping and snarling to show how independent she is. Yes, she dislikes the new earl profoundly, because he does not show his face at the estate for a year after her father dies, because he is so stiff and unsmiling. But oh boy, does he have reasons!  <br /> <br />I found it has a very witty, dry humor that I loved. It's in first person but we get to see much of the motivation and feelings of the other characters. The heroine, Lady Elizabeth Conway, is an astronomer but it isn't merely an excuse for the author to have her act up in public in order for the hero to have to save her. She's very dedicated to her work and it plays a pivotal role in whom she marries. The hero, Lord Clanross, is a wonderful man. He's moved straight up the ladder of favorite heroes.

He can do no wrong and is obviously his mother's favorite. When it becomes obvious to her brother-in-law that Jenny's mother can't handle and is unwilling to discipline her darling, he takes matters into his own hands and secures a midshipman's berth for the boy aboard one of His Majesty's naval vessels. On their way to see Robbie off at Portsmouth, Jenny runs into a gentleman who assists her then castigates her brother for leaving her alone and unprotected. Not until the first letters start arriving from the ship does she realize that the gentleman is Captain Tristram Allenby, her brother's captain. Robbie's letters paint a picture of a hellish existence all due to Captain Allenby. With these testaments to the man's character from their beloved son/brother, the women take him into extreme dislike. What they don't know is that Tris hasn't been able to forget the lovely young woman he met and is determined to woo and win her during his short two months leave.<br /><br />With the clock running on his courtship, Tris arrives near Jenny's home and starts to try to win her hand. He is charming and attentive and can't understand why Jenny seems to want nothing to do with him. There are times when she starts to respond to him but then she'll freeze up again, leaving him bewildered and hurt. His mother has accompanied him (she's a delight) eager for him to marry and start giving her grandchildren to dote on. While neither can figure out what Jenny's problem is, both soon realize that she is a person who has always been second to everyone else in her life and both are determined to do something about it. When he learns of the opinion that Robbie's letters have caused her to have of him, the mystery of her antipathy is solved but sadly he thinks that there is no hope for them. It takes her uncle giving her a true picture of life aboard a British man-of-war and her brother admitting that maybe he did go on a bit much over what is really nothing to convince Jenny of her mistaken beliefs regarding sea captains in general and Captain Allenby in particular. But naval men don't give up without a fight and one last effort leads to a HEA.	2004-12-02
US	51876301	R132IERNG60MDX	0821734563	550823961	The Bar Sinister	Books	4	7	7	N	N	very unusual regency but well worth reading	The only way I can think to describe this one is \\"Mary Stewart writes a regency.\\" If you're looking for a very well written regency suspense in which for the first 3/4 of the book (which covers 3 years) the h/h are together for a total of about 1 week, this is your book.     Captain Richard Falk is a widowed Army officer who places his two children in the care of Emily Foster before he rushes back to the war in the Peninsula. Emily is baffled as to why he doesn't take them to his relations until she finds out that his dead wife was Spanish and that he is a [...] with no English relations of his own.     At least this is what she believes until Richard's half sister shows up on day inquiring about her niece and nephew. Upon writing to Richard's friend and to-be guardian in case anything happens to him, she learns that Richard is the [...] son of not the Duke of Newsham, but his Duchess. And that Richard has real reason to fear that his half brother, now Duke, will take up where his father left off and try to kill not only him but also his two children. The old Duke never repudiated Richard and the Duchess has never acknowledged in public the scandal that titillated the ton, leaving Richard with the opportunity to claim a share of the rich estate.     But along with dodging the sinister plans of his half brother, Richard has to try to stay alive throughout the rest of the Peninsular Campaign, part of the War of 1812, then Waterloo. Plus he writes to his daughter and Emily's son serial accounts of Dona Inez, an incorrigible Spanish senorita and her duenna Dona Barbara, plus he writes hack novels to try to supplement his meager officer pay.     Once the very real threat to him and his children is uncovered, his sister and her husband take an active part in trying to spike the current Duke's plans and also bring Emily and Richard, whom Emily has fallen in love with over the course of their correspondence.     This is definitely not your typical regency and in fact is more like a regency historical as far as the suspense part of the plot. Richard is a man who has faced bastardy and its stigma all his life and who has learned to be wary of all but the closest friends. Emily is a very no-nonsense woman who rises to the challenge of providing a home for and coming to love and try to protect not only Richard's children but Richard as well. Lady Sarah, Richard's sister, and her husband, Sir Robert are wonderful secondary characters. The book is well written and researched and flew by as I read it. A definite B+	2004-12-02

Her father, a baronet, fell into drink and gambling and ended his life when his debts grew too large, leaving her to make her way in the world as a governess. There are several other interesting people with her on the Mail Coach to Cockermouth and they all get a chance to know each other better when the coach is waylaid by a snowy accident, leaving them all stranded at a small inn.  <br /> <br />By far the most interesting traveler is Sir Richard Severall, a Colonel in the Dragoons who has been invalided out of the Peninsular Army. He's immediately attracted to Dorcas but feels that he can't approach her due to the fact that she has no male family member with her and the belief that she wouldn't be interested in a man with a game leg.  <br /> <br />Their slow, quiet courtship occurs over a period of days until the snow melts and they can travel on to their destinations. There is a subplot with a highwayman they all help to catch and take to justice but the main part of the story is two lonely people learning that there just might be someone interested in them and then having the courage to try for love.  <br /> <br />The description of the country inn, the early 19th C English celebration of Christmas and finely detailed secondary characters make this a soothing, excellent read. <br />	2004-12-02

Perkins's heroes <br />are really her strong point. You just gotta love these men. Very Beta but <br />more than willing and able to jump in and defend their heroines from the <br />nasty villains. Sometimes I did wonder if maybe Gray was just a little <br />*too* good. He's the most set upon hero I've read about in a while.  <br /> <br />Perkins does need to work on two aspects though, her heroines and <br />her villains. It's not that the heroines are terrible but they just don't <br />grab you the way the heroes do. I agree that Maggie held onto her <br />secret for way too long and far past what a normal man's patience <br />would tolerate. Her villains are another weak spot. Very stock and <br />unsubtle. While this one isn't quite as \\"foam at the mouth\\" as the <br />MMM man, he's still too dastardly. A little colder evil might have <br />served better.    <br /> <br />I do like that Gray isn't ready to totally believe what the villain <br />said and that he is hurt enough to try to hurt Maggie just a little back. <br />That felt more real. The final confrontation between Gray and Lansing <br />is also more realistic and Perkins has a good feel for and description <br />of the duel. Another funny thing I noticed (after seeing some of the <br />Regency House and hearing the women complain about how bored <br />they are) is that the house party in this book is very similar. I'd've much <br />preferred to be a man at a house party. So much more to do! <br /> <br />The Improper Wife is a good way to try Perkins and see if you like  <br />her. And happily, she seems to be settling into her stride. I'd give <br />this one a B.	2004-11-28

I'm not usually a series gal <br />but this was light, humorous and fun. Shelby and Dallas sometimes <br />come close to stereotype territory (she's supposed to be zany <br />and he's the staid lawyer) but then deeper layers are shown <br />as the story progresses and we get to know them. It's all a little <br />compacted (for space reasons I would assume as the story is <br />only 219 pages long) but overall the situations are believable. <br />Perhaps a bit RomanceLand but not as off the wall and far out <br />as some plot premises and threads we've all groaned at.  <br /> <br />I'm not sure about the law aspects but Dunlop doesn't make the <br />mistake of trying to add too much detail to show how brilliant <br />Dallas is supposed to be. Nor does she have Shelby suddenly <br />acquire an in-depth knowledge of law overnight and crack a case.  <br /> <br />There's nothing earth shattering about this book but I had a fun <br />time reading it and the pages just seemed to fly by.

It started off fine and I was getting into it then the scene shifts to London and people started acting wonky <br />for late Victorian English people. The heroine sics her cat on another woman at <br />a lecture. The heroine's mother and sister throw paint on a Lord at the theater <br />in a votes for women campaign, the heroine along with the hero and his friend <br />act very childishly at a dinner party (and the other guests were no prizes either). <br />And I kept interrupting my reading and shaking my head as I said \\"I can't <br />see people from this era and station in life acting this way.\\"  <br /> <br />With the main exception of the hero (for most of the time) all these characters <br />acted like whiny children. They needed Time Out. Plus the fact that they <br />really didn't have much depth but rather appeared to be caricatures. And  <br />the heroine went from self imposed martyrdom from her guilt over the death <br />of her husband to totally involved in Egyptology within a few days despite the <br />fact that when we meet with her again (in London) she swears she'll never <br />work as an Egyptologist again!  <br /> <br />I stuck with the book to the halfway point then flipped to the last two or <br />so chapters and saw that it wasn't going to get any better. That's when <br />I bailed out.	2004-11-28
US	51876301	R1NAL2PXTJK9LR	0804119929	681195138	Foxfire Bride	Books	5	4	6	N	N	Fantastic vintage Osborne	Great ready Osborne fans, Maggie Osborne is back and it's vintage stuff. I've <br />had some trouble with her latest books (and didn't even read the one from last <br />year) but this one ranks up with the best. It's got a few problems (mainly some <br />unexplained plot set up points) but the characters are great, the interactions <br />are great, the scenery is great, the gritty details are....you get the picture.  <br /> <br />Fox is the kind of heroine I love. She's tough, she can survive, she can get <br />the job done. She doesn't go around shrilly insisting that she can do anything, <br />she just goes out and does it. She can outfight, outdrink, outride any man and <br />is one of the best scouts in the West. She also doesn't undergo a brain <br />transplant during the last third of the book and totally change who she is.  <br /> <br />Tanner is a wonderful hero. He's strong enough that he can take orders from <br />a woman yet still be a man. He begins to admire Fox for just the woman she <br />is and works tirelessly to find a solution to their relationship problem. And <br />it's a doozy. Osborne doesn't pull any punches with it. When the chips are <br />down, he doesn't yank out some childhood angst and blame Fox for it then <br />turn on her.  <br /> <br />But one of the best aspects of this book is the relationship between Fox <br />and a man who's helped raise her. Peaches is one of the best secondary <br />characters I've read about all year. In fact, probably in a long time. The <br />other two men along for the road journey are fleshed out enough to stand <br />on their own but don't take over the story with subplot distractions.  <br /> <br />I like the way Osborne resolves with main conflict of the book. It's not <br />totally cut and dried but ends realistically and a little open ended. What <br />isn't really explained too well is the reason Tanner is to bring the ransom <br />with him instead of just going to Denver and the reason the kidnappers <br />are willing to wait three months for the payment. Both Tanner and Fox <br />wonder the very same things and all that is said is that it's being done <br />this way because the kidnappers said to. I kept waiting for the reasons <br />but this was never cleared up.  <br /> <br />In this day of modern highways, trains, plains and automobiles it's easy <br />to forget an age when traveling from Reno, NV to Denver, CO took three <br />months of backbreaking, life threatening effort. But Osborne shows us <br />a land of great beauty that was the reward for such risks. I'd kind of like <br />to have seen it.  <br />	2004-11-28
US	51876301	R236BVDBPKC0SP	0821771833	191451292	Smuggler's Lady	Books	3	9	9	N	N	I'm in agreement with most of the reviews here	The title of this one is a bit deceiving as the heroine is really the smuggler instead of the hero. Even though it was written in 1986, the heroine is enough of a match for the hero that his tendency towards being overbearing is pretty much balanced out at the start. It's in the second half that the book falters.    <br /> <br />Our heroine, Meredith Trelawney, has had to resort to smuggling in order to pay off the debts of her deceased, spendthrift husband and restore the family estate. But <br />she also relishes the challenge and excitement it brings her. Something that <br />Damien, Lord Rutherford notices when he spies an encounter between Merrie's <br />band of smugglers and the Crown revenuers. He's come to Cornwall to look <br />over an estate left to him by a distant relative and to try to relieve the boredom <br />into which his life has sunk since his involuntary retirement from soldiering in <br />the Peninsula.  <br /> <br />When he meets Merrie in company, he first thinks she's a dowdy widow then <br />begins to see the game she plays with her neighbors to throw them off the <br />scent of what she really does. He's not stupid and quickly puts the pieces <br />together as he begins to fall in love with this unusual and delightful woman. <br />Merrie quickly starts to return his affections even if she resists the idea <br />of anything permanent between them. After all, he is the heir of a Duke <br />and her lineage can't begin to match his. Damien refuses to give up and <br />plots her downfall into matrimony. Sparks fly, wills collide, and the  <br />action moves to London as Damien and Merrie battle each other on the <br />path to a HEA. <br /> <br />The first half of the story works better for me as the two are fairly well <br />matched and the strengths of one balance the weaknesses of the other.  <br />I enjoyed watching them match wits and spar with each other while the <br />action kept things lively. Merrie has three younger brothers who add <br />to the story and give her even more reasons to risk smuggling. I liked <br />them quite as much as the leads. One false note was the portrayal <br />of the smugglers and smuggling as more Disney-like than the true <br />thuggishness of the trade.    <br /> <br />Then the scene shifts to London where Damien <br />has the upper hand and Feather has to keep repeating Merrie's <br />increasingly lame reasons for refusing his suit. She won't fit into his <br />world, she won't be accepted by his family, he'll eventually fall out <br />of love with her....all are laid to rest by his clever plans and Merrie <br />only makes herself look stupid for turning him down. Plus her <br />attempts to convince Damien of her unsuitability end up making <br />her seem childish and petulant while his actions to counter them <br />make him seem highhanded and ignoring of her wishes. This drags <br />on for far too long before suddenly the story is wrapped up leaving <br />me still wondering if these two have really worked out their differences. <br /> <br />There is much I liked about Smuggler's Lady. If you ignore the weak <br />reasoning behind Merrie's resistance, their interactions, taken singly, <br />were clever as they countered and parried each other. It is just the <br />repetition of them that paled. If the action had stayed in Cornwall, <br />Merrie would have stayed as strong a character as she starts out <br />and the story would have retained it's initial drive and excitement. <br />The first half gets a strong B+ from me but the second half lowers <br />the final grade to a B-/C+.	2004-11-28

It does <br />have gentle humor but don't look for a farce. I loved the subplot of the hero learning to <br />accept that his little girl is finally growing up.  <br /> <br />Other things I liked: the heroine <br />does a realistic job of trying to turn her company around with a believable <br />plan and actually uses her intelligence and MBA to do it. She also uses <br />all the skills in presentation and self-marketing that she acquired as a  <br />beauty pageant contestant, something that was never denigrated or <br />looked down upon by the author. I also liked that the heroine wanted a <br />bit of time to sort through her feelings about her marriage and didn't <br />immediately rush into a new relationship.  <br /> <br />I liked that neither the hero nor heroine stood staring at the other <br />with drool running down their chins. And that the author didn't use <br />stupid gimmicks to separate them nor indulge in pointless and  <br />inappropriately timed sex. Another plus is the fact that none of  <br />the secondary characters are used solely for down-home cutsey <br />humor nor made to be two dimensional cardboard cutouts.  <br /> <br />I did get a little tired of Miranda's initial crying jags but then her  <br />husband had just left her after she'd learned that he had a thing <br />for ladies undergarments and had been having an affair on her <br />so I'll cut her some slack. This is Wax's second published book <br />and I'll be looking for more from her.	2004-11-28
US	51876301	R2KF9ZN1708H8C	0505525194	686361693	Dream Of Me	Books	5	6	6	N	N	excellent paranormal	<br />After the slight disappointment of Come to Me, I'm really glad I opted to buy this one new, both to read it and to support Cach. This is the kind of book from her that I'd hoped Come to Me would be. Overall it has a slightly darker tone lightened with flashes of Cach humor. The world is well thought out and described, the characters <br />are consistent, their changes are believable and don't feel forced or too about face.  <br /> <br />There is a great deal of sexual tension throughout the story (the true love scene <br />doesn't arrive until the very end). Some might quibble about how ignorant the <br />heroine is about sex but I kept in mind that she was raised in a convent, <br />was never around young women her own age and status with whom she <br />could gossip, lived in an environment where there were no men and the <br />women around her who might have set her straight had been threatened <br />with torture by her fiance should she learn \\"the facts of life.\\" (The reasons <br />are all explained in the book) But Theron soon sets about opening her <br />eyes to life and in her dreams, they begin a passionate relationship.  <br /> <br />I like how Cach shows Theron's gradual realization of the life to which <br />his actions have condemned Lucia. How he really \\"sees\\" it and hates <br />what he's done. And how once he and Lucia have had their great <br />confrontation, his thoughts are not of revenge against her but how <br />he can save her from a terrible marriage and future life. Her reasons <br />for what she does were slightly more shaky to me but not totally <br />unbelievable.  <br /> <br />I did also like the changes in Lucia. She starts off as a kind of dreamy <br />(and sort of self indulgent) young woman who has to face some hard <br />truths about herself. That she does and matures from them is a nice <br />treat.  <br /> <br />The secondary characters add needed elements to the story and aren't <br />just place holders. Some of them aren't too nice (and it's nice to see <br />them get what they deserve). The opium withdrawal illusions of one <br />character are deliciously fun to read.  <br /> <br />As to the question of which book should be read first, I think you could  <br />start with either one. The main reason to read Come to Me first is to <br />find out just what was in the dream that precipitated both stories. If you <br />read the prologue of CtM, you'll know. I think we see enough of Theron's <br />character and drive to obtain his goal to appreciate how much he changes <br />over the course of the story.    <br /> <br />While I wouldn't give this one a straight A, it comes close and will probably <br />end up an extremely high B or A- for me. <br />	2004-11-28

I am very glad I did. The heroine is a delight. Smart, good at her job with a wonderful <br />sarcastic wit that doesn't begin to grate on me by the halfway point of the book <br />(as so many of these types of characters end up doing). I also like that the hero falls in love with her just as she is instead of after the Extreme Makeover session. As for the obligatory personal baggage which our hero and heroine must carry, well his I can understand. Her's is mentioned a few times but there ends up being a reason for it.  <br /> <br />I kind of guessed who might be the ultimate villain but the suspense and clues were such that it really was just a guess. The secondary characters were well done <br />especially the 80 year old werewolf hunter. Loved his deadpan sense of humor.  <br />The woo woo stuff is there but then you know that from the beginning and it doesn't take over the story until right at the end. I also like that the heroine doesn't immediately believe in it nor does she continue to stubbornly refuse to believe it <br />even as she watches the woo woo stuff happen. Handeland already has another book planned for the series (which has an excerpt at the back) and I can't wait for it.  <br />This one is a strong B/B+ from me. <br />	2004-11-28
US	51876301	R3TZ1QQSZQ5S2Y	0373075758	574448853	Hero Under Cover	Books	3	20	21	N	N	ok but not fantastic	This is an early Brockmann that was written in 1994 and resurrected and published in 2001. The suspense part of the plot takes a little bit of a back-seat to the tons of lusting that goes on. But I did find the underlying reason for the actions of the villains to be believable.  <br /> <br />The heroine is an archaeologist who is suspected by the FBI and CIA of being involved in a series of museum bombings. The CIA hero is placed under cover as her bodyguard when she's threatened and has her home/lab broken into by some shadowy group trying to get their hands on an old death mask she's currently authenticating. The agency hope is that the hero will get earn her trust and learn something to help them nail her for the bombings.  <br /> <br />Most of the book centers on him watching her and watching out for her. There is <br />a sprinkling of information on authenticating artifacts but I don't know enough to tell if Brockmann did her research or not. There is a heck of a lot about what the heroine eats. What I did find hard to believe is the fact that the heroine doesn't immediately go to work on authenticating the piece that is causing so much trouble. The FBI and CIA use the fact that the heroine is being threatened for handling it as a cover to have its owner put a 24 hour guard on her for weeks and she just lets it sit in her safe while working on other pieces? I would think she'd want to get rid of it quickly but then we'd have no story.  <br /> <br />I also thought the change in whether or not the hero believed her innocence very quick and would have expected to have a few scenes of him poking around through her stuff and listening in on phone calls. Instead he just seems to accept that she had nothing to do with the bombings. But it's a series book so maybe space was a factor here. All in all, it's not bad but has an awful lot of lusting.	2004-11-28
US	51876301	RAGHBEYZERPD0	0505525135	309255740	Love Me Tonight	Books	3	10	10	N	N	ok but not great post Civil War novel	<br />Helen Courtney needs someone to help her manage her farm, get in a crop and hopefully let her keep from selling the old family homestead. Kurt Northway needs a way to earn money to pay for his return journey to his home state of Maryland. So the Confederate widow hires the Yankee captain to work for her all summer.  <br />This is a very character driven story of two lonely people falling in love, along with how Kurt's young son learns to trust and love the father he has never really known.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed this more than the last book of Ryan's that I tried but there were still <br />some problems.  <br /> <br />Likes: that Kurt has a legitimate reason to be in the South, without money and <br />in need of it to return home. That Charlie (the son) acts like a five year old. He's <br />not too precocious and he doesn't use lisping or baby talk. That Helen doesn't <br />immediately melt into Kurt's arms or stand around staring at him in a lust daze.  <br />That Ryan seems to have done her Farming 101 research.  <br /> <br />Problems: The townspeople near Helen at first ostracize her (all summer long <br />for four months) for hiring a Yankee, beat him up then *suddenly* the whole town <br />has a guilty conscience and shows up apologizing profusely and willing to  <br />help rebuild Helen's farm after a terrible hurricane. That Ryan tells a lot more <br />than she shows and uses a simplistic writing style that worked for me at first <br />but quickly got tiresome. That the villain and his villainess are cardboard  <br />and slightly OTT in skankiness.  <br /> <br />One thing that could go either way is that Ryan has written a very hot story <br />with lots of simmering tension. Only the tension simmers for half the darn  <br />book and gets just slightly old after a while. There are three very nice  <br />secondary characters Jolly, a neighbor who befriends Charlie and starts <br />to draw him out of his shell and Helen's best friend Em and her beau <br/>Coop. We get to see a lot of Jolly but not enough of Em and Coop's  <br />romance.  <br /> <br />I also wondered about the fact that very few people in this <br />town just outside of Mobile seemed to have suffered much deprivation <br />from the war. Yes, lives were lost and some of the houses are headed <br />into decline from lack of manpower to keep them up but no one seems <br />to have had any raids, confiscations or looting. Helen still has all her <br />china, crystal and silver. Wasn't Mobile invaded and occupied by <br />Union forces during the war? It just seemed odd to me.  <br />	2004-11-28
US	51876301	RKP14WUU39NM0	0451211286	7422775	My Forever Love	Books	2	13	17	N	N	sorry, not nearly one of Canham's best	I'm sorry I can't love Marsha Canham's last novel. I barely like it. I had read the reviews when it was first released and had hoped that I would agree with the better ones. Alas and alack the mention of the slow middle, the weak heroine, weak romance, the disjointed plot and the problems with the hero's retainers mirrored mine own. Certes, methinks mine grade maybe slightly lower.    <br /> <br />Brief plot: Amaranth is fleeing from her second abusive husband and takes refuge in a village on the land of excommuncant Templar knight Ciaran Tamberlane who saves her from the killers sent by her husband. He takes her back to his remote castle, learns her history, meets her loutish evil husband and vows to deliver her to the <br />convent of her choice to escape. Then some derring-do is thrown in at the end <br />about King Richard returning from his captivity after the Third Crusade.  <br /> <br />I have some major questions about things that happen in this book. I might <br />be reading it wrong or be totally off base in my understanding but...a) if <br />Ciaran is a Templar, wouldn't he be a monk and therefore unable to marry? <br />Or does the fact that he was excommunicated release him from his vows? <br />And if he's excommunicated, wouldn't that mean that no Christian could <br />aid, abet or have anything to do with him? Especially marry him?  <br />And why would Father Michaelus at the Abbey turn to Ciaran for  <br />help in getting King Richard home? A man of God asking for help <br />from a man cast out of the Church? <br /> <br />b) peasants can't count? What? They have fingers, they have toes. <br /> <br />c) how did Amie manage to blend in with the few retainers and serfs that <br />Ciaran has at Tanier? If gossip spreads so quickly that it's known  <br />throughout the castle immediately, is everyone suddenly blind to the <br />new turnspit boy? No mention is made of intense devotion to Ciaran <br />as their liege lord. But if they are so devoted, why would anyone be <br />afraid of betrayal caused by the large reward offered by Odo for word <br />of his wife? And how does Odo's left behind servant manage to remain <br />unremarked upon for a day? <br /> <br />d) the two knights traveling with Ciaran and Amie to the convent are lords? <br />Wouldn't they be Sir Boethius and Sir Geoffrey? <br /> <br />I was disappointed that suddenly a minor villain from the prologue gets <br />resurrected for the last battle. It seemed tacked on and unnecessary.  <br />And would he have been left a beggar by the Temple?  <br /> <br />I was much, much more interested in Marak. I knew he couldn't be the hero <br />(after all as one reviewer mentioned, it's the guy with the castle who is  <br />always the hero) but he was much more intriguing and different a character <br />than Ciaran. I thought he and his love Inaya were wasted here. Either  <br />forget the quickie romance of their's or flesh it out.  <br /> <br />I'm afraid that by the time I started skimming the last third of the book, I  <br />was pouncing on all the problems I had with the plot and characters. A <br />few things I could have breezed over or ignored in return for a tighter plot <br />and more interesting romance but in the end, there were just too many for <br />me. A shame since this is supposed to be Canham's last book.	2004-11-28

Our heroine, the widowed Lady Eleanor, is indeed a woman with a past. Stifled in an arranged marriage, <br />she dared to take a chance at love and was abandoned by the father of her child. <br />She fled to a small town outside Cambridge and even though her husband claimed the child as his own, she has lived a secluded life with her son trying to live down <br />her notorious past.  <br /> <br />John Caldwell is a sweet Beta guy. He's puzzled as to why this Lady is so <br />cold towards him initially but since he's not a member of the ton, he doesn't know <br />of her past. As John is a self made man and has to watch his step in Trinity <br />College society, he soon learns that his growing friendship with the reclusive <br />widow and her son could cost him dearly.     <br /> <br />Catherine Blair has written a sweet, gentle character centered love story. <br />Since it's set outside of London and the Season, we get a refreshingly <br />different look at regency society and a reminder that those who fell from <br />grace did indeed have to worry about \\"what society would say.\\"  <br /> <br />The main characters are people I felt happy spending more time with <br />and for whom I rooted all the way. Especially nice is the relationship <br />between John and Eleanor's son William who truly does act like an <br />eight year old boy. The pace of the romance is slow and steady <br />and never gave me the feeling I was watching 21st century people <br />playing at dress-up.  <br /> <br />If I have a qualm, it is in how Eleanor is suddenly accepted by <br />a large section of the female society around Cambridge and in  <br />her small village after having spent eight years there feeling as if <br />she would be shunned if she dared poke her head outside. The  <br />resolution of the outside conflict also felt a bit fairy tale like, even <br />if it was nice to see the minor villain get his comeuppance.	2004-11-28

Marriage Material is the first of Wind's trilogy about three brothers living in Colorado. Reckless and Her Ideal Man are the other two that follow.  <br /> <br />Yep, it's a secret baby book but it's one that rises above the usual. I liked the <br />realism of a single mother trying to provide the best she could for her child.  <br />Majoring in something she didn't particularly care for because it would lead <br />to a good job that would allow her to give Cody more. Of the little joys and <br />indulgences she and he looked forward to. There is a lovely scene during  <br />which Tamara puts on a CD of waltzes and dances around her living room <br />with her son. Watching them, Lance begins to realize all he's been missing <br />in his life. <br /> <br />I liked that Lance tried to be honest with himself and with Tamara about the  <br />type of man he was. That when he found out about his fatherhood, he didn't  <br />know what to think and was confused about how he should feel. That felt  <br />realistic to me. I also like the slow progression of his and Tamara's feelings <br />for each other.  <br /> <br />Another nice point is that even though we know that Lance's two brothers <br />will have books, neither was in this one to promote that. Each had scenes <br />that served *this* book. There is also a budding romance for their  <br />mother that I hope will be carried on in the next book. The story also <br />wasn't loaded with typical small town \\"characters.\\"  <br /> <br />I've collected lots of Ruth Wind categories and am looking forward to  <br />reading them for the November author poll. This one is a strong B.	2004-10-22

It nicely follows the first but you don't need to have read Marriage Material before trying <br />this one. There's a lot of ground to cover in a 250 page book but Wind manages <br />it very well. <br /> <br />Back Blurb: <br /> <br />Jake Forrest had always believed in honor. It was how he lived his life, made his choices. Dressed in army greens, he stood tall and proud, his startling blue eyes focused on the task at hand, his broad chest swelled with pride. Then it all disappeared, and Jake wanted only to forget. <br /> <br />It was only in the arms of Ramona Hardy that Jake found peace. But the small-town doctor had fought demons of her own, and she knew the love growing between them could never last...until Jake stopped running from his past. Their future depended on it.\\" <br /> <br />Jake had always wanted to be a soldier. Growing up listening to the stories of  <br />Harry, a WWII vet, Jake had dreamed of being one of the good guys who  <br />made the world safe. Only his dream has turned into nightmares which <br />haunt his days and won't allow him to sleep. Not unless he's got more than <br />a few belts of Scotch to help. Ramona Hardy is sure she's looking at a <br />man with a classic case of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and if Jake <br />doesn't seek help soon, his demons will drive him into even worse <br />reckless behavior.  <br /> <br />But Ramona has some demons** from her own past. Ones which she's <br />dealt with allowing her to create a nice, safe life as a country doctor. <br />She and Jake both know they aren't each other's usual type. But the <br />physical attraction is as strong as the emotional one and they find <br />themselves seeking the other out. Any chance they have for  <br />happiness depends on Jake finally coming to terms with what <br />happened to him and he's the only one who can do that.  <br /> <br />As I said earlier, Wind covers a lot of territory inthis book but manages <br />to do it without rushing the ending or shortchanging anything. I really <br />like that Ramona is different from Jake's usual tall, leggy blondes.  <br />She's short, a little plump and by golly, she stays that way. And <br />in Jake's eyes she goes from a little Miss Wren to the best woman <br />in the world. It's not overnight but nice and slow and believable.  <br /> <br />And I like that Jake's healing isn't a miraculous, sudden change. <br />The boy has some serious problems but I felt he was well on <br />his way to dealing with them. Not there yet but the light at the <br />end of the tunnel is sunshine and not a train.  <br /> <br />As with Marriage Material, the Forrest family plays a background <br />role in the story but never crowds out Jake and Ramona's book.     <br />Plus it has cats! And dogs! I'd give this one a B+.  <br /> <br />   Spoiler follows:      <br /> <br /> <br />** <br />Just in case anyone wants to know (and it's revealed fairly early in <br />the book), Ramona was raped as a teenager. We don't see the <br />event and it's not told in flashbacks or anything but we do see <br />how it still affects her and learn how she battled past the event.	2004-10-22
US	51876301	R29YKA4OKIFDB9	0505525208	286191135	Come To Me	Books	3	14	14	N	N	Daring idea but flawed	I love Lisa Cach's books. The Changeling Bride is one of my top romances, <br />and many of her other's are fun, favorite reads. I was delighted when I  <br />read she was going to have two books out in two months and that she <br />was returning to her fairy tale, paranormal style. After having read Come <br />to Me, I'm not so sure anymore.  <br /> <br />The heroine of Come to Me is a sex dream demon, a succubus who  <br />comes to men in their sleep and gives them pleasurable dreams. <br />Or rarely, nightmares to punish those who have treated the women <br />in their lives poorly. Samira has done this for over 3000 years and <br />the pattern almost never changes. Until one night when an incubus, <br />her male equivalent, asks a favor. He wants her to give a nightmare <br />to a Prince and break a political alliance with it. With no thought <br />as to its effect, she does and thereby brings war and terrible  <br />suffering to another kingdom and one of its princes, Nicolae. <br /> <br />This prologue is, let me be honest, quite disturbing to read. I can <br />see why Cach does this, after all the heroine is a demon and <br />must be shown to need redeeming, but it's hard to read. Then <br />for the next third of the book, Samira is a dark creature until <br />she assumes human form for 30 days. Now all of a sudden, <br />we get Samira the wannabe cute demonette. Cach inserts <br />humor here, some of it literally bathroom humor, and tries <br />to make Samira cuddly and endearingly naive. The change <br />is stark and it's not easy to switch gears.  <br /> <br />Then, during the last third, Samira gets a heart and goes all <br />care bear, group hug on us. Meanwhile, our hero Nicolae <br />spends his time searching for revenge by thumbing through <br />books on demonology and the occult. To do what? we don't <br />know. He doesn't know. No one knows and the story kind <br />of drifts. Then comes the \\"love conquers all\\" ending. Again <br />with a cute punch, that while original, doesn't quite match <br />the dark opening of the story.  <br /> <br />Another point is that the book is fairly short, just less than  <br />300 pages so Cach is forced to use the \\"I will never ______ <br />again!\\" (love, trust, try) type of characterization and actions to move  <br />her story and characters along. The subtle changes and shading <br />that I've enjoyed in other books just isn't here. All of which makes <br />me wish for the type of book I know she's written in the past.  <br />This one was good in parts, OK overall but could have been  <br />much better. C+/B- <br />	2004-10-10

Anton creates <br />some vivid characters who actually seem to be mid 19th century  <br />people. I did catch a few bloopers such as a mention of rubber bands <br />but overall, I didn't get the impression of 21st century people in  <br />hoop skirts. The concealed identity plot becomes a MOC one that <br />leads to one semi misunderstanding which thankfully doesn't go on <br />for too long. If you're looking for a nice Civil War era book, Emily's <br />Captain earns a B from me. One slight warning though.... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />there is a miscarriage during the course of the book and the heroine's <br />family actually owns slaves.

This one is from 1996 and though it has its strong points, overall they are canceled out by the TSTL heroine and the bumbling FBI agents.  <br /> <br />There is a serial killer on the loose and he's targeting women who look like Jess Baxter. A new tenant has just moved into the apartment above her house and even though he's lived in the neighborhood for over 6 months, Jess knows very little about him. But she does think Rob Carpenter is hot. And he's a great a kisser. Based on that and multiple orgasms, she just *knows* he can't be the killer. Never mind that the FBI does. Never mind that Rob won't tell her anything, and I mean anything, about <br />his past, present or future. Never mind that he's lied to her and she knows he's concealed his identity. She'll risk her life to help him evade the police and FBI because she's in love.  <br /> <br />Oh please. If I had a small daughter and a drunkard ex husband, there is no way I'd be risking her future not to mention my life because some guy is great at locking lips. I don't care if he's cute, I don't care if you feel like screaming the opening lines of the Hallelujah Chorus when your moment of bliss hits you, I'd be wary, watchful and waiting before I'd let him in my house and bed. Jess is just Too Stupid to Live for most of the book.  <br /> <br />And the FBI agents? Don't get me started. I just hope and pray that the actual agents would be better at handling a real case then the way they're portrayed in this book.  <br /> <br />What I will say for the book is that Jess is a loving mother who seems to be trying to raise her daughter right. And even though the list of suspects is pretty much laid out from the beginning, I was still guessing til almost the last 50 pages of the story who really dunnit. And Jess does (finally) rise to the occasion and kicks some major @$$ when the chips are down. But the woman is in denialfor far longer than is healthy with a sicko on the loose who's raped and slit the throats of 15 women.	2004-10-10

But it's also obvious to me (from having read Quinn's <br />latest books) that she's really improved in this aspect of writing and plotting. <br />So B for the first part, C for the last third and a B- for it all.	2004-09-10

Then carries it a bit further into the months after the war.  <br /> <br />Colonel Ben Morgan has been sent west on a mission he despises but one <br />he will see to completion. The tough Union officer is to round up a group <br />of Confederate soldiers who have been raiding Union supplies being sent <br />to the western forts. A moment's distraction lands him in deep trouble <br />when his horse is spooked by two rattlesnakes. After being thrown, his <br />leg breaks and he's bitten twice. That's when Ryan Mallory and her  <br />escort find him. <br /> <br />Ben wakes up to find himself a prisoner of the very men he is supposed <br />to capture and hang as a warning to other Rebel raiders. But what's even <br />worse, the leader of the Second Texas Cavalry is his old room mate from <br />West Point, Sean Mallory, a man once closer than a brother but now a <br />bitter enemy from years before the war even started. Now the men have <br />even more to fight about as Ryan and Ben begin to fall in love.  <br /> <br />Ryan has been staying with the troops since Sean is her last relative and  <br />the Indian situation together with the war have made Texas unsafe for a  <br />loan woman. Sean knows the losses she's already faced and is  <br />determined to keep Ben from hurting her even more. Something  <br />he's sure Ben will do even if he doesn't mean to as he's got more  <br />than enough lifetime baggage of his own. But as the war drags to a close <br />and Sean heads back to war torn Virginia after leaving Ben and Ryan <br />at a Confederate prison fort in Texas, no one knows who will even  <br />survive to try and build new lives.   <br /> <br />This is another nice effort from Potter and is a welcome change from the usual <br />Civil War setting. It's also a story losely based on a true life incident. She <br />gives Ben enough emotional baggage to make his actions and reactions <br />realistic, has the conflict between Ben and Sean severe enough to make <br />their antagonism believable and nicely fleshes out the secondary  <br />characters. What made me grit my teeth a bit was the Little Miss Sunshine <br />heroine who is always left staring after Ben with big wounded puppy eyes <br />after he snaps at her from the depths of his tortured soul. Just once <br />I wanted her to really haul off and wallop him hard enough to fell him like <br />an ox. \\"Yes, I know you have trust and committment Issues but stop  <br />treating me like *&$#@.\\"  <br /> <br />What really brings the story up a notch is how the conflict between the two <br />sides is realistically shown, the anguish is felt between those who had once <br />been so close, and we get a glimpse of the aftermath without sugar coating <br />the years of hard struggle yet to go to put the country back together again.  <br />I'd give this one a strong B grade.	2004-09-10

Kirkman knows her medieval/Dark Ages history (she's an Englishwoman from Chesire) but doesn't make too many allowances for those who might not. It's not that hard to follow what is happening but a quick glimpse at a history of the times might help with the political situation and customs of the day.  <br /> <br />The book is more a character driven story and to be honest, <br />not a lot really \\"happens.\\" It's mainly interactions between  <br />the hero and heroine as they learn about each other. Most <br />of the conflict is believable and the miscommunications are <br />understandable because of the nature of the times and  <br />the characters. As I said, there is a whole lot of thinking <br />and observing at first and if you get impatient with that <br />type of novel, this one might not be for you. But I found  <br />the ending to be emotionally satisfying and can see a <br />happy future for Sigrid and Leifwin.	2004-09-10

She gets her facts straight without making a big deal of it or info dumping you. And in The Parson's Pleasure she tells the boy meets girl story from a slightly different perspective, that of a man forced into the clergy who really wants more in life.  <br />  <br /> Miss Claire Oliver is the daughter of a Baron who lives a quiet country life with her loving parents. She is a young lady of good looks but not exceptional beauty, intelligent, practical and the possessor of a handsome portion. A portion which <br /> she gratefully knows will allow her independence after her parents pass on and she is left as a spinster, there being no one in their small community she desires to marry and not having found anyone during her one Season in London. It is not until the new parson arrives that she discovers just how much she would miss a lifetime spent with a man of her heart.  <br />  <br /> Mr. Christopher Bennett is the son of the younger son who has had to depend on the grudging generosity of his wealthy cousin to make his way in life. The avenues which he wanted to explore, land steward to his cousin, member of parliament, have been denied him and he found that fighting the Americans in a senseless war while missing out on defeating the true enemy in France a waste of lives. Now his one path left in life is that of a clergyman but he is determined to do more with it than his lazy predecessor even if he puts a few noses out of joint in his efforts to help the truly needy. When he finds the woman of his heart, his position as a dependant poor cousin unable to support a wife truly strikes home.  <br />  <br /> Claire and Christopher are delightful characters and it is sweet watching them slowly fall and admit their feelings to themselves. It is also obvious just how hard it must have been in this society to fall in love with one whom you knew <br /> society would not allow. Wynn tells a nice character driven slice of country life story with nary a Duke spy in sight. Unfortunately, she ends it with a convenient conventional HEA that sidesteps all the dilemmas she had given her two lovebirds. So a B for almost all of the book and a C for just the resolution. <br />  <br />	2004-08-01

But I do wonder how many of these women continued in their professional careers after marriage (as Polly seems set to do). <br /> <br />Polly is also a mistress for most of the book (nice change) but started out as a 17 year old virgin (sort of hard to believe she had kept her maidenhead in her circumstances for that long a time). Feather balances this by an event I wasn't expecting towards the end of the book when no punches get pulled as <br />Buckingham takes his revenge. <br /> <br />I like Nick even as he cold bloodedly prepares Polly for her role in his plan. I get a sense of him as a man of his times who doesn't hesitate to put the little woman in her (lesser) place even though he loves her. He goes for the win in all battles of wit and precedence (though Polly does seem able to control <br />him fairly well) and their relationship is similar to the battles of the sexes in the plays in which Polly stars. <br /> <br />There are some nice secondary characters but I was a bit disappointed that Feather didn't use more of the great calamity of the year (the Great Plague of 1665). This book also featured Feather's low key sexual tension style but as I was expecting it, it didn't bother me as much.	2004-07-27
US	51876301	R2CQSJ58EHZ81W	0380758083	836503924	Bold Destiny	Books	5	11	12	N	N	great character and plot driven novel	Kabul, Afghanistan in 1841/42 is definitely not where a British person wanted to be. The conditions were perfectly horrid, the natives were getting restless and the British Army outpost was stuck with high level officers who couldn't command their way out of a paper bag. For Lieutenant Christopher &quot;Kit&quot; Ralston the terms &quot;hell on earth&quot; and &quot;bored out of his mind&quot; about summed it up. That is until he met Ayesha. Or rather until Ayesha held him a stiletto point after he interrupted her bath. It was at that point that things began to get intriguing. For Ayesha was obviously a European by birth, spoke English fluently but acted and was treated like a favored one. The favored one of one Akbar Khan to be precise. The same Akbar Khan who was stirring up trouble and would soon lead the people of Kabul and the wild hill tribes of Afghanistan against the British Raj.  <br />  <br /> After his encounter with Ayesha, which included a night of passion the world weary Kit had never before enjoyed, he couldn't get her out of his mind and endlessly schemed in his mind how to free this Englishwoman from the powerful Khan who held her as his favorite. But it wasn't until the uprising began in Kabul that Kit had a way to get Ayesha, or Annabel Spencer as she was known before her abduction at the age of twelve, away from the Khan and into his arms in the besieged British cantonment. Now all he and Annabel have to do is survive the slow starvation of the <br /> cantonment, live through the hellish retreat of the British and their dependents through the snowy Khyber Pass as they are constantly attacked by the Afghans,  <br /> and evade the wrath and revenge of Akbar Khan before they can begin to deal with trying to ease Annabel back into a British society she hasn't lived in for eight years and isn't so sure she even wants to attempt to rejoin. After which they might or might not have their HEA.  <br />  <br /> True love never runs smooth and for these twoit's more like a wild trip down a rocky cascade. Kit is faced with a woman who probably will never act like a standard British woman he expected to marry. A woman who confounds him, teases him, teaches him and turns his life upside down. While Annabel has to try to find a place for herself in a society which she sees as more restrictive and which she's spent the last eight years viewing as &quot;the enemy.&quot; She's neither fish nor fowl and along with Kit is dreadfully aware of the fact that Akbar Khan is toying with them like a cat with a mouse. Can they survive Afghanistan and if they do, do they really have a future together?  <br />  <br /> Feather has done a wonderful job with the setting and mood of the book. The history isn't merely wallpaper and I learned a lot about a war I hadn't even known existed (1st Anglo-Afghan War). <br />  <br /> Ayesha/Annabel is a strong woman who is assertive rather than feisty and who can more than carry her own weight. Kit is her equal in honor and sometimes stubbornness. Both stay true to character and the times throughout the book. An added bonus is a villain who has reasons for what he does and who doesn't foam at the mouth. Plus there are well done secondary characters who advance the plot rather than just fill space. All in all, it's one of the best books I've read so far this year.  <br />	2004-07-27

She's the daughter of a smuggler and wrecker and he's the illegitimate son of Charles II. She has visions of the future which branded her a witch and condemned  <br />her to hang at Tyburn. He turned privateer after Charles refused to acknowledge him and his family had no further use for him. After Morgan's raid on Panama turned bad, James was captured and brought to England to hang as a pirate.  <br /> <br />But fate took a hand when they escaped together and now they're off to the Caribbean where James knows where a fortune in gold lies hidden on a seawreck. Along the way a one eared tomcat named Harry hitches a ride and together they meet people from Lacy's visions, fight pirates, fight each other, fight sharks and find a treasure. But will they fall in love?  <br /> <br />French wrote this one in 1994 and it's just a little dated but still not a bad read. The cover is atrocious and the back blurb just about bursts out of its boddice. Ignore them. Lacy is a strong heroine who unwisely falls in love but who still has enough grit and determination that she won't let her <br />dreams be sidetracked because she has. She loves James but he's <br />repeatedly told her he intends to go back to England and earn the <br />respect of his peers. She accepts that and doesn't whine to him <br />about it. She's going to use his body for as long as she has him.  <br /> <br />James starts as the slightly haughty well born wannabe lord but he's intelligent and wise enough to accept Lacy as a partner and he is totally honest with her about his plans. You might get frustrated with him but you know what he is and what he wants. He also helps Lacy accept who she is and realize she's not the witch everyone says she is. And she helps him realize what he really wants from life.  <br /> <br />The history is more than wallpaper and is well done. There is a slight paranormal aspect to the story that might bother some and a secondary character who just has to be accepted. It all does come together though and I would give it a B. There are two other books in the trilogy which follow the family in future generations into the 18th century in America.	2004-07-20

Yes, to both. Then, since the hero is a famous rake, he probably had to whore for England and is now suffering the pangs of conscience<BR>and feels he's Not Worthy of the pure love of the heroine. Yes, to both. And with a name like Lady Cat, the heroine is probably a feisty little thing who will not hold the hero's terrible rakish past against him and who will agonize over his hurts and ultimately redeem him totally. Yes, again. <br />The plot is nothing new now though in all honesty in 1994 it probably was and I probably would have given this a higher grade had I read it then. As it is, it's a good example of its type and I give Brockway points for having a slightly different twist to the standard \\"English caught in Europe before the battle\\"<BR>scenario (the hero and heroine must flee from Paris as Napoleon is first moving through France after his escape from Elba). So, I'll give it a B- because Brockway does tell a good tale but it's nothing that most people probably haven't read to death in the past decade. Oh, and the hero's proposal is funny. Since both are interested in land management, he thinks to persuade Cat to marry him by telling her that \\"Together we will <BR>raise the most prime marino wool. What a nice flock of sheep we could have!\\"	2004-07-16
US	51876301	ROSJUJGOHVNH1	159105186X	11776096	Harley Street	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Well done Georgian series	&quot;Harley Street&quot; takes up where Lynne Connolly's third novel in the Richard and Rose series, &quot;Venice,&quot; left off. The series follows the courtship, marriage, honeymoon and now first months of married life back in London of Richard Kerre, Lord Strang, heir to the Earldom of Southwood and Rose Golightly, a young woman of no great distinction from Devonshire, England. <br />All along, they've had to deal with a society who thinks Richard will soon begin to cheat on Rose, family members still unsure of the match, society eager to witness any faltering and the two poisonous people with whom our hero and heroine were first matched. Julia, the wealthy heiress to whom Richard was betrothed and Steven the young and handsome curate who cold blooded wanted to use Rose. They have joined forces against our young couple and are determined to make life difficult for them. In &quot;Harley Street,&quot; the battle is brought back to London and involves some episodes from Richard's dark past which have come forth to haunt him and test the strength of their love. While Rose begins to navigate her new life in Georgian high society, she and Richard must see that a murder is solved, an old wrong is righted, and escape the nets of viciousness with which Julia and Steven try to entangle them. <br />Connolly does a fantastic job of period research which she seamlessly adds to the story. Her love scenes are passionate without being purple and her characters well drawn. I got a real feel for being in Georgian London, presented at Court, living among the ton and having to watch my back to avoid the more dissolute members of that world. I enjoyed watching Rose gain confidence while she moves into her new life and both gain strength from their love for each other. The secondary characters are nicely done though some are more in the background of this story as befits the fact that Rose is moving on into her new life. <br />Where the book falters a bit is in the fact that I'm getting a little tired of the two villains and their schemes for revenge.  <br />I do like the fact that Connolly has the gumption to allow a secondary character to have a fate that is more in keeping with the times and not forced into a Cinderella Happily Ever After. She has done some unconventional things and it's a refreshing change. While I think that you could probably pick up any of these books and enjoy them without having read the previous ones, it definitely enhances the experience to know what has happened before.	2004-07-15

French does another good job of setting a war torn couple in the Delaware/Eastern Maryland shore area and letting them believably fall in love. Scarlet Ribbons is about a Loyalist heroine, Sarah Turner, who runs an inn to which Patriot spy Forest Irons is sent to discover who is leading<BR>the men raiding farms and plantations in the area. Both have secrets, neither expected to find love with the other and now they have to decide what to do about it. <br />French gives the story a good period feel and sets it in an underused section of the country during the terrible winter of 1778/79 when Washington and his troops were starving and freezing at Valley Forge. It was vital that supplies be kept moving to the troops and for the Americans to learn who was raiding and stealing those valuable supplies. Forest hates lying to a woman he's beginning to fall in love with but he's determined to do his job. Sarah is terrified for anyone to discover her secret as it could affect not only her life and livelihood but also that of her young son. <br />The divided loyalties which split the country are shown in both the main characters and the secondary ones, and how little those loyalties protected either side becomes clear as the story progresses. The love scenes are well done, without being purple, and better still, well placed. No boinking amidst a pitched battle or any such nonsense. Most of the characters<BR>are well drawn and believable even if the villains are painted with too black a brush. I liked the slow development of love and changing of sides. Neither felt rushed. The ending isn't ruined with a tacked on epilogue either.	2004-07-15

I should have been more so with this one. Jess Taggert is such a frustrating character. One minute she loves the Raider and ridicules her husband to his face then she turns around and snap at the Raider for saying something against Alex. Plus she always, always acted before she thought. Even by the end of the book, even when every time she did something, she put herself, Alex, her siblings or the townspeople in<br />danger, sometimes of their lives. If I had been Alex, I'd have dumped the *&amp;^$% ages ago and let the British hang her. <br />But then Alex has his moments. As himself, I like him and felt for him when termagant Jess taunted and scorned him yet again. As the Raider, he doesn't treat Jess much better than she treats him. Especially see the scene when he takes her virginity. I started out liking his escapades since he doesn't have the masked avenger part down too well. But then it seems like everything he does, causes more trouble and endangers even<BR>more people. After a while, I began to wonder if the town would survive too much more of his &quot;help.&quot;<br />I like Jess's sister Eleanor much better though I would have liked to have seen more of her romance with Nick (the Russian prince). Jess's brother Nathaniel is an interesting character and shows much more maturity and wisdom then Jess ever will in her whole life. The portrayal of the British is so unbalanced and I got really tired of them foaming at the mouth and being nothing but redcoated Evil. By the end of the book, I was skimming madly just to finish.	2004-06-20

One of the daughters of the Duke of Richmond and Lennox who was the son of one of Charles II's [illegitimate child] by his French mistress Louise de Querouaille (as its spelled in the book). Sarah and her sisters were well known figures of Georgian society. \\"As<BR>Shadows Haunting\\" shows a more of her life in detail than the series had time to<BR>do. She is a woman who was within a hairs breath of being George III's Queen, who then married unhappily, went through a series of lovers, had a [illegitimate child] child then ran away with the child's father only to be abandoned by him to face the disgrace of her actions and suffer society's sanction. After being divorced by her husband and<BR>publicly branded an adulteress, she finally, years later, found the love of her life. As the wife of Captain George Napier, Sarah lived out her life as a beloved wife and mother. <br />The fictional character of Sidonie Brooks and the real life person of Sarah Lennox never actually meet in the book, but merely glimpse each other through time. But each becomes important to the other in many ways: Sidonie offers friendship and<BR>compassion to Sarah when it is needed most and in return gets an amazing chance to view a vanished time and gain musical insights which skyrocket her career. Each woman deals with love and loss as the book shows that while fashions may change, people and the problems of life really don't. <br />Lampitt wrote the book in 1995 but it has an older, 80s style of writing. Not so much bodice ripping as a more slow paced, descriptive style like that of Sheila Bishop. Lampitt is also an Englishwoman and one who has clearly done her research. The Georgian age comes alive without turning into a history dump and Sidonie's career as a modern musician is interesting to read. It's not a book for everyone but I found it an enjoying and engrossing read.	2004-05-31

The heroine alternated between  apparent heartless indifference to the awful fate of her fellow captives  and fawning subservience to a man who had branded, beaten and humiliated  her. In contrast to Ms. Hart's usual spunky heroines who will stand up for  themselves, her almost foot-licking worship of this arrogent jerk was  almost sickening. The book also showed a lack of research. Don't waste your  time with this one. Instead, try Charmed or Impulsive. Both are MUCH  better.	1999-05-17
