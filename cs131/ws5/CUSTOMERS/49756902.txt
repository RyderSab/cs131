APOLLO  15 was deemed by NASA as the first &quot;Moon&quot; mission of great exploration, due to the HADLEY-APPENINE Mountain  region of Moon, and the Moon's first car! THE LRV, or lunar  roving vehicle. I was friends with JIM IRWIN who told me back in 1987 that that's where he spent his summer vacation in summer of 1971.On The Moon! Dave Scott and Apollo 15 crew were very brilliant men like all the others who; on this mission however; just happened to stumble along the oldest (to date) Moon rock brought back to the Earth. Called THE GENISIS ROCK, GENISIS meaning  in the beginning or the oldest! I am so humbled and honored at being the first to do my review of APOLLO 15S BOOK. I just know the late Jim Irwin would want me to . This one's for you JIM!!! Jim told me that how the mountains of THE MOON gave him a feeling, a presence  of sensing/feeling God'd presence there. At how after that point on his life began changing for the better! I will lift up mine eyes, from wence cometh my help. first scripture quoted on Moon by COL. IRWIN, a verse from Psalms! Apollo 15 was first true mission of great exploration!!!!!!!! i say this because  another fine book called: APOLLO EXPEDITIONS TO THE MOON said so and nasa as well!nDue to the location in Moons mountanous region and the lunar roving vehicle {LRV} as well.See the mountanous areas of THE MOONwere thought to have the oldest known rocks that erupted from MOONS inner core to the surface from possible lunar volcanoe's metorites hitting  lunar surfc. Thus resulting in throwing Moons inner core particles to the surface millions of years ago, scientists speculate. The Genesis Rock was dated at 4.5 billion years old!!!!!!!!!!!! was the size of a large persons fist. Jim Irwin also told me that he was MOON'S first ditch digger in a joking mannor. As he and DAVE SCOTT, mission commander dug for lunar samples and experiments. Jim Irwin also said that there was an insant where the lunar car{rover} had a problem with a mechanical procedure when deploying it for first time on Moon. Jim had to along with DAVE SCOTT; try to{in bulky suits) to fasten a loose nut/bolt under rover and the troubles they encountered. Jim told me how he had to get fixed in a one knee position and how &quot; through his prayers&quot; to OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST successfully got critical problem repaired; crucial to rovers operation!!!!!!! And finally the excitement of how DAVE SCOTT wanted to take rover way down a very steep slope  down HALEY RILLE, and Jim told commander SCOTT: &quot; You can go down there if you want to DAVE; however, Im staying here&quot;, worying that if the two of them got stuck down in the canyon; it could be life threatning! Jim passed away in 1991 from a major heart attack jogging. He often told me that due to his space/lunar suit's food/water feeder into his mouth not working properly, he lost much potassium from perspiration that he often felt was responsible to his heart problems later on! COMMAND MODULE PILOT ALFRED WARDEN was especially trained to do first &quot;real&quot; extensive mapping of lunar surface for first time for future remaining flights, and an extra day was spent in orbit mapping out lunar surface. a great read. Ill never forget you Jim! TONY!	2001-09-07

I wrote my on-line reviews for Mr. Plaster's other Sog (1st) book, and after purchasing 2 copies of this book; as well, I've decided to tell just  how I feel in my heart and soul for The US Special Forces and especially,  the &quot;men of SOG&quot;! All my life since my brother-in-law came back  from Vietnam, I've wanted to &quot;tell the world&quot; just what my  &quot;deepest&quot; inner feelings have always been towards these  brave,unselfish and heroic men! When I was growing up in 1970's, there, to  me, were still down-to-earth athletes who played sports; not for the money,  but for the &quot;true&quot; thrill and sportsmanship of &quot;the  game&quot; . Today's society has had so many people turn bad, get filled  with corruption and greed; nothing but negative things! No wonder &quot;our  society&quot; today has so mush disrespect in it! I know for certain that  those i know and work with; i sure wouldn't want to go into battle with  them! Well! The men of SOG were a group of very patriotic and giving  soldiers that were my true heroes; now and always! I have always had this  deep-emotional respect for &quot;our&quot; US Special Forces! After reading  the &quot;great&quot; SOG books by John L. Plaster; I just can't believe  all they endured and sacrificed of themselves for us and our country! We as  a nation should be giving so much back to these &quot;great&quot; american  men; to whom if it wasn't for them; Democracy could have been a thing of  our past! Thanks to them, we are still free and can do as we please each  day of our lives! All everyone ever does around me at work or &quot;in  general&quot; is complain ! Read these good John Plaster biik's and you'll  soon understand what &quot;real men&quot; really wrer, and really were  like! To go days without proper food, no food,water, to be shot ,  interrogated and tortured, and still believe-in and respect our country and  flag; dispite all they went through! Yes America, this is really what  &quot;America&quot; is truly all about, &quot;sacrifice&quot; for not only  &quot;our country&quot;, but of one another! WE need to reverse our steps  in this country today and take a &quot;good&quot; look at (the past) and   just the brave/heroic deeds these men did; so that &quot;we&quot; all could  and &quot;are&quot; here, today in a free and democratic society! The  &quot;men of Sog) gave their lives for others, gallantly and never  hesitated thinking about it! America, to them, came first and &quot;our  flag&quot; You were told to do something and you followed your superior's  orders! That's the way it was then! I, personally, see our society  different today. There are &quot;still&quot; good people out there, however  &quot;we&quot; should &quot;all&quot; count are blessing's that some of us  never had to endure what the brave&quot;men of sog) and all other vets had  to! More should be taught in school today about these unsung heroes of our  nation's past conflicts!  To you, THE MEN OF SOG AND ALL US SPECIAL  FORCES, I humbly and respectfully salute &quot;you&quot; all, and want to  personally (thank you all) from the bottom of my heart and soul; so that I  am still: alive, free and live in the USA, under a democracy, thank's to  all of &quot;you&quot;! You were and alway's be &quot;my lifelong&quot;  heroe's and role model's! I only wish more younger generation people could  see more of what &quot;you vet's&quot; had to endure and sacrifice for our  &quot;great land&quot;; and mayby &quot;we&quot; in the USA would be a more  respectful and &quot; greatful society than what we are today! Yes, our  technology, today is fantastic, however men will never be of &quot;the  great&quot; caliber that &quot;you&quot; the men of sog will always be, and  stand for! tHIS BOOK REPRESENT'S THESE &quot;REAL&quot; American's, their  battles, mission's and campaign's. Their self pride in one another;  teamwork and loyalty to each other and our &quot;great&quot; country! These  fine-brave men are like me; in that we may not alway's believe in a certain  thing, or what someone say's. However they believed in God and Country and  The American Flag and what &quot;she&quot; represent's, (FREEDOM)! They may  not have liked something; however they followed order's and respected their  leader's with gallant valor for our country! Why? Because AMERICA mean's  something to them all, their loved one's and familie's, and alway's will! I  will always feel the same as them all; and will alway's respect, admire and  will never forget what all&quot;of you&quot; have done for our  &quot;great&quot; land, called, AMERICA! If I had the chance, I would do  the same for you all, as well! My hat's off to you all! My deepest respect,  men of SOG, VIETNAM and &quot;all&quot; foreign wars! Mr. Plaster's books  on sog &quot;are by far&quot; the best book's I've ever read! They told me  &quot;all&quot; that I've alway's wanted to know about The Vietnam War, and  special observation's/operation's there! These sog book's are many year's  overdue!

All of my life I have wanted to get to talk with someone in the: US SPECIAL FORCES, and here what it was like in Vietnam! I was a youngster at  the time of the Vietnam War, all safely snug in the protection of my  parents and school! I am 40 now, and have come to realize how lucky I was  at not having to go to the war! I can still remember one June day in 1970  when a boy down the road was killed in Nam, and his mom's reaction to it,  and my brother-in-law going there, and coming home a different person!  After seeing John Plaster's great book, and his follow-up photo history;  along with the show on SOG on the History Channel; it made me come to  realize what the &quot;true&quot; meaning of our flag is; and what it  constantly takes, (sacrifice) to be in a country where freedom is  &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;really&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;  taken for granted in today's society!  I work around many young men  that recently graduated from school; and how disrespectful and disobedient  they are to taking simple orders from our foreman! I always say to myself:  &quot; what they, and many in today's society needs is to go through the  ordeals that you all had to endure&quot; ! I respectfully and humbly want  to thank all of you &quot; SOG&quot; mrmbers and all who served in Vietnam  and all foreign wars; so that we are all here, today, still, free and able  to do as we please; in a democratic society! Everyone's always complaining  about work being  &quot;too&quot; hard, or life being too much to bear!  Well after reading Mr. Plaster's book and photo history, it's made me  appreciate life, living and living in a democratic society so much more!

Well let me  say that as a true believer in CHRIST and GOD, I feel that Dr. Mitchell has  a very open and well-educated mind as a scientist/explorer; and merely  tells us that there is in fact a creator, and a purpose for the creation of  the universe, and a reason for its being; relating science/religion  together,which, to me, makes a whole lot of good sense.and purpose, to  those of us that are real thinkers and have a real open mind to the things  around us in the whole universe; not just planet Earth! Dr. Mitchell should  know, hes been there (MOON) AND DONE THAT! i'M VERY RELIGIOUS INWARDLY, AND  STILL THINK YOUR BOOK IS WELL DONE! Good job Dr. Mitchell!
