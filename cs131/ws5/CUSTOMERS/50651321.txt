Jen, Rette and Avery were terrific characters and I loved the fact that the book wasn't set in a \\"big\\" city like New York of Los Angeles.  The book had a \\"Sex and the City\\" like feel to it and was just as good as an episode of the show. I hope Theresa Alan is working on a new novel because I am a fan!!!	2003-05-23

Yet two weeks ago on the show we're told by Justin that Brian bought the bracelet in Mexico. Which is it?  Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.  I'll pass on the next novel.	2003-04-08

I read David Stukas's first novel, SOMEONE KILLED HIS BOYFRIEND in trade paperback and thought it was great. At the end of that book there was a teaser for GOING DOWN FOR THE COUNT. The little that I read made me want to read more, so I bought the book and I'm glad I did. The book's terrific!  It's just as funny as the first. I can't wait to read Dave's next installment!	2003-02-25

It's not often that I'm laughing out loud while reading a murder mystery, but this one had me chuckling and guffawing as I turned the pages.

Lisa Jackson is my new favorite when it comes to thrillers.  She kind of reminds me of Tami Hoag, only not so brutal.  I couldn't stop turning the pages, I was on the edge of my seat.  And I loved the way she set things up for the sequel, COLD BLOODED -- I wish it was coming out now instead of next June.	2001-09-07

I don't know about the rest of you, but I've had it with King and Koontz.  Their stuff just isn't as good as it used to be.  Do they not care  or are they only doing it for the money?  This author really kept me  turning the pages.  I see that she has another book coming out next month.   I hope there will be more books coming after that because when it comes to  new horror authors there are very few new ones to choose from.  I still  like John Saul, though.	2000-06-15

This is the first Lucy Stone mystery and in my opinion, one of the best.  Who cares if the title was changed?  As a mystery reader, when I find a series I like, I want to read ALL the books in that series, especially the  first one.  Obviously the previous publisher didn't know what they were  doing, otherwise the book still would have been in print. This is a really  good mystery, with a great cover and title.  If you like good mysteries,  happen to be a fan of Leslie Meier and Lucy Stone, AND you HAVE TO start a  myster series from the first book, do yourself a favor and buy this book  today!	1999-12-03
