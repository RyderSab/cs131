While there are plenty of other books and resources that pick up where Ozzie leaves off, this book establishes a solid foundation for the others to build on. Each song builds on the skills used in the previous one and Ozzie breaks each song down, measure by measure, to make them easy to learn. The songs are in the old style, very sweet and simple, but don't let that put you off...the more you listen to them (and play them), the more you will fall in love with them. Highly recommended.	2003-02-10

Unfortunately, it ends right in the middle of the story, with the majority of the plotlines left unfinished and hardly any loose ends tied. And that's a shame, because up until the last few pages it's a really good book that is hard to put down (other reviewers have done a good job reviewing the actual story, so I won't repeat them here). But the authors either ran out of time in the middle of their story and had to hand something over to the publisher or think it's OK for a story to depend on a sequel rather than building the foundation for one. My recommendation is to wait until the sequel is published then buy both books together so you have a complete story.	2003-01-30

If you already know how to program in C and you have either CodeWarrior or the Palm GCC tools (the book does a good job of covering both, despite what the previous review said), this is the only book you'll need to buy. Why? Plenty of explanations, lots of sample code, and an easy-to-read writing style make this book not only useful, but enjoyable as well. It's not perfect (the author fails to mention, for example, that an Edit menu with ID of 10000 will be automatically handled for you by the OS...instead he writes his own Edit menu handler) but the faults are few and far between. The bottom line? If you're serious about Palm programming, this book is an excellent, must-have investment.	2001-05-11

There is a tremendous need for a good, readable book that teaches design patterns in a way that the average reader can understand and follow and which uses Java for code examples. Unfortunately, this is not that book.<br /> In a session at JavaOne 2000, the author stated that he wrote this book as part of his process of learning about patterns, and it's clear throughout the book that he didn't have a full grasp of the patterns he was writing about. For example, on page 80 he mistakenly identifies Java's AWT adapter classes (such as MouseAdapter) as being examples of the Adapter pattern. They are not.<br /> In addition, as other reviewers have pointed out, the book is riddled with typos and also suffers from poorly chosen code examples. Given all these problems, I cannot recommend this book at all for anyone interested in learning more about patterns. As hard as it is to read and understand at times, the Gang of Four book is still your best bet.	2000-11-27

But Holub has not put the code in the public domain and if you use any code out of the book it must be accompanied by  what amounts to an advertisement for the book in your program's About box.  While this may be marginally acceptable for shareware developers, it kills  the usefulness of the book in corporate development environments. If Holub  removed this restriction I'd give the book 5 stars.	2000-07-12

It will, however, turn into pure programming muscle as payback for all your effort!<br /> This is an academic  treatise (it started out as a Master's thesis) and reads like one. But as  you read you'll find yourself identifying with some of the patterns that  you've unknowingly used in your own code. And you'll start seeing how you  could have used other patterns. And before you know it, your approach to  programming has changed and you are able to focus more on the  domain-specific issues rather than getting caught up in the need to  continuously re-invent the proverbial wheel. And the world looks a little  bit brighter.<br /> Any book that does that for you deserves 5 stars  regardless of how dry it is.	2000-06-24

(In which case they would have  been better off with &#34;Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture: A System of Patterns.&#34;) All such  expectations aside, however, this book is an enjoyable guide to project  management that is well worth reading. As for the criticism that it is  nothing more than common sense packaged as wisdom, I would argue that  common sense is nothing more than applied wisdom, and the common sense this  book aims to teach is sadly lacking in too many companies today (hence the  existence and popularity of Dilbert). BTW, the reviewer who attributed  the quote, &#34;there is nothing new under the sun&#34; to Shakespeare  might be amused, given the nature of the quote itself, to find that it was  originally written by Solomon (in Ecclesiastes 1:9), quite some time prior  to Shakespeare!

The Internet, and particularly the Web, removes physical distance and allows people to communicate with each other in a way that is completely independent of where they live. It does not, however, remove cultural, emotional, intellectual, or spiritual distance. For this reason the advance of modern communications methods will never result in the homogeneous society many seem to fear. Our individualism will remain intact but our exposure to the world around us will continue to increase exponentially (both to our benefit and detriment). Ms. Cairncross has accurately grasped the true impact of the Internet and those who are able to leverage this impact will be the ones who guide the future of the medium.	1998-01-16

Co-authored by one of the founding members and lead developer   of the Java project at Sun, this book weighs in at almost   1700 pages, over 140 of which are used for the comprehensive    index, and all of which are put to good use.<br />   The book covers all the class libraries, including the AWT and   applet packages, and includes brief overviews of each package.    The bulk of the book is made up of the class library reference   section. The classes are organized alphabetically, with their member   methods following. Each class is introduced with a diagram   showing it's place within the class hierarchy, along with its   syntax, a description, a member summary, and example code. Each member entry   includes sections on purpose, syntax, description, parameters,   see also, and an example (some of which refer back to the class   example). According to the book cover there are more than   600 examples and over 20,000 lines of code. (There is no CD-ROM   included but the code can be downloaded from the Web.)<br />   If all this sounds like a dream come true for Java programmers, it is.
