Three diverse tales, all colorful and engaging.  Reading these tales makes one wish Flaubert had written more.  Other reviewers have described each story in more detail so I'll keep my descriptions brief.  Beginning with \\"A Simple Heart\\", the story of a lonely servant-girl named Felicite who devotes her life to helping a single mother raise her children in a small Normandy village; moving back in time to the medieval era and a capitvating re-telling the legend of \\"St. Julian Hospitator\\" who devotes himself to God after being haunted by the thousands of animals he'd hunted and killed as a brash, arrogant youth; far back to the time of Christ, when \\"Herodias\\", King Herod's head-strong wife, instigates the beheading of John the Baptist, unintentionally paving the way for Jesus Christ himself; Flaubert has created three \\"religious\\" tales that plainly and simply illustrate the status of Christianity at different times, in different places.  Some readers of Flaubert find undertones of sarcasm in these tales (more prevelant in \\"Sentimental Education\\" for sure), but I really believe he's attempting to be as non-judgmental as possible, simply telling it the way it is; or was.  It seems to me that Flaubert's intention with these stories (especially \\"A Simple Heart\\" which to me has the most character depth & uniqueness of the three) is to not only showcase his literary skills, but to challenge himself to write about three seemingly unconnected eras and linking them by a common thread.  Flaubert's descriptions and details are always of the highest caliber (although sometimes tiresome if one's not used to his style) but ultimately, each tale stands on its own, making \\"Three Tales\\" an excellent introduction to one of the most influential, and talented writers of all time.	2005-08-30

This is a baffling novel.  Firstly, there are a lot of characters to keep track of, all interacting with one another, often in \\"very French\\" ways.  Secondly, I felt overloaded by descriptions of . . . well, everything!  As this is my first Flaubert novel I can't compare it to any of his other works, but man is he ever the literary artist!  He would've made an awesome travel-journalist; instead, his genius seems to lay in the fact that he applied those skills mostly towards people and Parisian society.  Lastly, I was simply in awe that I continued to read on with avid interest while nothing seemed to be happening.  In fact, most readers are hard pressed to describe what exactly does happen in this novel, as witnessed by other reviews.  It's a strange thing to read a novel with no plot to speak of and yet still find it interesting.  And this novel is unike any other in its time as far as I know.  While Balzac's Human Comedy is the birth of \\"realism\\", Flaubert might be the father of \\"naturalism\\". His quick, simple, rapid-fire, pithy style (which can be hard to keep up with at times) is unrelenting to the point of confusion.  I guarantee you'll find yourself lost regarding place, time, and even characters - especially \\"lovers\\". But it's all amusing and captivating; afterwards it certainly feels like Flaubert intended this ironic cynicism as his \\"plot\\" & point.<br /><br />In short, Flaubert has encapsulated the emotional history of his generation.  Frederic Moreau lives off of a family inheritance, doesn't seem to work (except at trying to leech off of high society, or \\"contacts\\" in various fields), and spends most of his time courting a married woman, while spending time with another out of spite.  He's a jerk because of how he talks about the women who do love him, and yet we sympathize with his desire to help his needy friends when he can, and to discover his purpose & place in tumultous times (when are the times not tumultuous and discombobulated?).  Meanwhile, Flaubert has re-created all the major historical events of revolutionary France, intending them as background to Frederic's emotional malaise.<br /><br />The combination is quite ingenious, and I think he pulls it off magnificently.  My only hang-up about this novel (and why I didn't give it 5 stars) is that it's just not as captivating a story to me personally as I hoped, and was difficult to get through at times because of its complex intricacies which definitely will appeal more to a literary historian than the general reader.  If you love French writers, are interested in literary criticism, and perhaps like to write yourself, Sentimental Education is a must read, must have.  I feel like I need to re-read this book someday, giving it a little more attention than I did this time around reading it sporadically on the train to and from work over the past month, but that's my fault.<br /><br />Definitely a classic; almost an \\"underground\\" classic, due to its controversial notriety and being lesser known & less popular than Madame Bovary, etc.  Definitely influential and unique.  But not for everybody; especially those who can't enjoy cynicism, and have to \\"sympathize\\" with their protagonists in order to empathize with them.needy friends when he can, and to discover his purpose & place in tumultous times (when are the times not tumultuous and discombobulated?).

You can probably find it even cheaper used, here on Amazon.  Even though the book was written in 1954, and subsequently updated (with a game or two of Bobby Fischer, etc.!) I've found it perfectly concise and comprehensive for both beginners and intermediate-advanced chess players.  If you play a lot of chess but have never read any chess books then I recommend this as a wonderful supplement.  Your game will only get stronger with study.  Because there are so many chess books available it's hard to figure out what one needs, but for starters, this is excellent because it not only contains a basic introduction to the game, it also includes chapters on openings, the middle game, end game, and a number of famous games from the Nineteenth Century (filled with timeless tactics & strategies that show the evolution of the game).  All in all, Golombek has written a highly instructive and easy to follow Penguin handbook which, with a little time and effort, will undoubtedly polish your style and strengthen your (chess) mind.<br /><br />Three other chess book recommendations for anyone wanting to go beyond simply \\"playing\\" chess but wanting to learn more might also be interested in the following:  \\"Begin Chess\\" by David B. Pritchard (see my review); \\"The Art of the Middle Game\\", Paul Keres & Alexander Kotov (also a Penguin Handbook); and finally, \\"The Pleasures of Chess\\", by Assiac (most conversational & enjoyable to read of all).<br /><br />Good luck!  Enjoy chess.	2005-07-20

Really, I don't understand all the hype surrounding this book.  This is the first book by Lagerkvist I've read, and maybe my last (although, I'm considering giving Barabbas a try).  This guy won a Nobel Prize!?  This book is okay, but not much more.  In a nutshell, the story centers around a forlorn female prohphet living in the mountains above Delphi in the 1st Century.  She is visited by a troubled man who supposedly came across Jesus and disallowed him to lean upon his house to rest on the way to Golgotha.  This 154 page novella consists partly of him telling this \\"sibyl\\" about this event, but the vast majority is of her telling him her life at a stinky goat temple, and how she was booted out by the people for having a forbidden love affair.  The ultimate moral of the story is that god is neither good nor bad, and that he is with us no matter what we do.  While there are some nice descriptions, it's long-winded, and in the end, slightly pedantic.  Seriously, how long can a monologue go on?  The male visitor is supposed to be sitting there in the dark listening to this old woman go on and on all this time?  We never learn anyone's name.  And her mute, retarded son sitting in the corner suddenly vanishes into thin air like a spectre; and this is supposed to provide a sense of awe and mystery?  I just couldn't get into it.<br /><br />That said, I will say that Lagerkvist writes in a simplistic and appealing way, and has some artistic talent which makes me want to try another of his novels.  I was interested enough to read the Sibyl twice now over the past couple years; mostly because I felt I'd missed something the first time around.  But I don't think so now.  I don't want to spoil the book for others because obviously some reviewers really liked it, and you may too.  Maybe it depends on your age, or frame of mind.  I think I would've enjoyed this book much more had I read it as a teen-ager; or perhaps it would've had more of an effect for me in my early twenties.  But for this type of \\"mythical fable\\", any novel by Hermann Hesse, Thomas Mann, Mark Helprin, Umberto Eco, Tolstoy or Dostoevsky, etc, etc. is better time spent.  Nobel Prize!?<br /><br />Good luck.  Maybe Barabbas is better.  Then again, literature reviews are generally subjective, and I have to say that the majority of reviewers here who gave this book more than three stars sound like they're on crack.or this type of \\"mythical fable\\", any novel by Hermann Hesse, Thomas Mann, Mark Helprin, Umberto Eco, Tolstoy or Dostoevsky, etc, etc. is better time spent.

Struggling to raise children and grow crops on land they don't own, in a community whose traditions and character are on the brink of extermination by big-business.  Read this book and take up the fight for social justice, job creation, and land reform.  If anything, read to understand and feel how lesser fortunate people in this world of ours have lived, and continue to live.<br /><br />Though Necatar in a Sieve takes place in India and is about a rural family there, its themes are universally applicable, especially in these modern days of globalization and gentrification.  Kamala Markandaya died in May of 2004 and it seems that the American press mostly ignored her passing, which is a shame because she is definitely a pioneer of a burgeoning Indo-European line of authors.  Nectar in a Sieve has been on the reading list of many a high-school & college for decades now, and thus highly influential for thousands of American & European students past and present.  And that's how I first came upon this little gem, in a college course on Eastern Religions, just before I visited India for myself.  Though written/published in the early 1950's, I thought this book well crafted and insightful.  I was better prepared for my own experiences of Southern India, feeling just a little wiser about life and the people I met there.  Markandaya tells this story of the peasants Rukmani and her husband Nathan in a heart-felt, straight-forward manner with many picturesque passages creating an aura of beauty amidst hardship.  Her love of the land is reflected in Rukmani & Nathan's joys growing rice and vegetables, raising children, and in their interactions with colorful characters from nearby villages.  There are also vivid depictions of hunger, misfortune, anger, loss and sadness, which underly the harsh realities of this \\"fictional\\" novel.<br /><br />Although Kamala Markandaya was from India's Brahmin/upper-class and became an ex-pat in London, she certainly spent time around India's agrarian peoples and was obviously affected by their plight (she has written nine other novels dealing with similar subjects).  As a novel, Nectar in a Sieve has a lyrical, romantic quality to it, which may account for its initial popularity here in the States, however, reading it in the 1990's and again more recently, I find it poignant and interesting.  If there's any passage which sums up this novel, it may be the following:<br /><br />\\". . . We have no money. My husband can till and sow and reap with skill, but here there is no land. I can weave and spin, or plait matting, but there is no money for spindle, cotton or fibre. For where shall a man turn who has no money? Where can he go? Wide, wide world, but as narrow as the coins in your hand. Like a tethered goat, so far and not farther. Only money can make the rope stretch, only money.\\"  - Ch. XXVII<br /><br />And anyone who chastizes the author for emphasizing \\"money\\" here, probably has their head in the clouds (not to mention, a full stomach, and some property to boot) and is missing the point.  This novel is about hope, and the hope that is necessary for people to strive for a better, more secure life, ONLY achieved through gainful employment and a stable income in a capitalist world.  Where these opportunities don't exist, or barely exist, you will have thousands of Rukmanis, Nathans, Selvams, Pulis, etc. begging in your towns and cities.  And thankfully, there will be other \\"Kamala Markandayas\\" to document their stories for those who are willing to open their eyes to the world around them.\\"fictional\\" novel.   <br /> <br />Although Kamala Markandaya was from India's Brahmin/upper-class and became an ex-pat in London, she certainly spent time around India's agrarian peoples and was obviously affected by their plight (she has written nine other novels dealing with similar subjects).

US	38794152	R1RXV9ZX42YINY	0140176233	142189783	The Rifles: Volume Six of Seven Dreams: A Book of North American Landscapes	Books	5	8	9	N	N	About our continent in the days of THE RIFLEMEN . . .	Having now read all four currently published Dreams in this series, The Rifles, which is the shortest of the four at 340 pages (+ 70 of source notes, glossaries, etc.) seems the most strange and dream-like.  It is a cutting edge blend of modern travelogue, historical research, and imagination.  The ill-starred Franklin expedition of 1845-1848 to discover a northwest passage underlies this volume's take on the larger series theme of European and Native American interaction.  Two central aspects of this theme are the Canadian relocation of Inuit peoples in the 1950's from Quebec to various Arctic islands, and the hypotheses that rifles were the ultimate source of demise for these peoples.  As in each of the other Dreams, Vollmann injects heavy doses of modern realism into the \\"Rifle-text\\", having at once the effect of scattered shards of glass in a children's sand-box, and ice-bergs jutting from a tranquil sea.  Landscape descriptions are consistent in their non-romantic portrayal of desolation, serenity, and danger.  As Vollmann states in an end-note, it is a sort of companion-piece to The Ice Shirt.  Both take place in the North American Arctic and include thinly disguised and candidly undisguised personal travelogues which complement the \\"ages\\" in which each novel dwells.  Beyond the historical contexts of this novel, there is the sad & twisted \\"love story\\" between the modern Inuit-Quebecois girl Reepah & Subzero (who should be added to the list of male-female counterparts I mention in my review of Argall).  But this is no ordinary love, since it sometimes involves Captain Franklin, his wife, the author himself, and the Inuit goddess Sedna.  The author's alter-ego Subzero, exchanges delirious thoughts on women and exploration with Captain Franklin as though time and place were immaterial.  In fact, distinctions are altogether absent in many passages and it's almost impossible to distinguish between sets of characters.  On page 120 Vollmann (or is it Subzero?) asks, \\"...are you behaving differently at this very moment because someone not yet to be born for a century of more will someday think about you?\\"  There are similar sequences in The Ice Shirt, and to lesser degrees in Fathers & Crows, and Argall (each work uniquely powerful & worthwhile), but here in the most \\"modern\\" dream this timelessness is much more pronounced.  Sound confusing?  Check out the source notes for hints & clues if necessary, but it definitely helps to stay alert to which \\"voices\\" are speaking (the narrative frequently alters between 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-person) and to understand that much of the novel deals with the author's own (mis-)adventures in modern-day Arctic Quebec in relation to & for insight into the original Franklin expeditions.  With Vollmann's Seven Dreams series it's best to read on and not get bogged down, because a lot of stuff that doesn't make sense at first will make sense later.<br /><br />Next up, Volume 7: Cloud Shirt?  From what I understand this will be about the Hopi & Navajo in the American Southwest during the 1970's-1980's.  Volume 4, Poison Shirt might be about King Phillip & The Great Swamp War of the mid-late 17th century.  And Volume 5, Dying Grass is slated to cover Chief Joseph of the Nez Pierce plains Indians.  Whatever he turns out, whenever, I can't wait - Vollmann's dream series is forcing a much needed up-date in the consciousness of the various \\"Ages\\" of our North American continent.\\"...are you behaving differently at this very moment because someone not yet to be born for a century of more will someday think about you?\\"  There are similar sequences in The Ice Shirt, and to lesser degrees in Fathers & Crows, and Argall (each work uniquely powerful & worthwhile), but here in the most \\"modern\\" dream this timelessness is much more pronounced.

Here we have a post-modern retelling of English colonization.  As with volumes one and two, Vollmann adapts his writing style and language to the flavor and times in which he dwells.  His research is deep and impeccable, and one of the most interesting things to me in reading the Seven Dreams is his unique style and method of mixing \\". . . colors not only from the palate of times, but also from the palate of places\\" (The Rifles, 377).  Did I really read of a bullet or bullets laying on the frozen ground in one foreshadowed scene from The Ice Shirt (which took place in the 10th Century)?  There are a few such strange instances in Fathers & Crows.  Less so in Argall, though, which mostly sticks close to the life and times of Captain John Smith (1580-1631).  Smith is a similar \\"yeoman\\" type character to Poutrincourt & Champlain in Fathers & Crows, and perhaps Eirik the Red in The Ice Shirt.  Vollmann utilizes these men as launching points into their time-periods, reassessing their trials and tribulations, conquests and failures.  Likewise, in each of the first three volumes we find historically forgotten, but important women.  They include Freydis Eiriksdottir & Gudrid Thorbjornsdottir in The Ice Shirt, Born Swimming & Tekakwitha in Fathers & Crows, and in Argall, Pocahontas.  As of yet, I have not read Vollmann's so-called prostitute novels/trilogy, but am familiar enough with his research into and use of prostitutes in his various stories.  Having now read the first three volumes of the Seven Dreams in order (and looking forward to #6, The Rifles), it's not surprising to find this recurrent theme of a male \\"glory seeking adventurer doomed to failure meets and interacts with his depraved and deprived female counterpart\\" (note also, interactions between Pere Brebeuf & Born Underwater in Fathers & Crows).  What's fascinating about all this is that through Vollmann's modern day lenses (and those are some thick lenses!), \\"historie\\" and \\"histoickall facts\\" come across as more than the \\"Symbolic History\\" he is creating.  What happens is exactly what he wants to happen, and that is to \\". . . further a deeper sense of truth\\".  The phantom-like, piratical title-character Argall, as is the town of Gravesend which John Smith hales to & from (in \\"several compass circles\\") are good examples of the blending of truths and untruths in order to create \\"an account of origins and metamorphoses\\".  In reading Argall you are not reading history, exactly.  It is based on history, but is closer to poetry than a novel, because poetry transcends the strictures of a traditional novel.  Its genius lays not only in its concept as part of a larger North American landscape puzzle, but in its execution.  While The Ice Shirt contains a captivating dis-harmony of time & place, myth, legend, history, and modern travelogue; Fathers & Crows a more refined and fine-tuned sense of direction & story-telling; Argall is a magnificent culmination of language & character.  It felt very enlightening, especially to one who grew up with very idealistic and naïve notions of adventurous Pilgrims arriving on the Mayflower, trading and sharing Thanksgiving feasts with blissful, welcoming Indians.  And Pocahontas seemed some romantic \\"Indian princess\\" who delighted those bold and faithful colonists.  Of course, most of us become less naïve and more enlightened as we grow older and expand our horizons.  As with any deep poetry or \\"meditation\\", Argall (and The Ice Shirt, & Fathers & Crows) is an enlightening experience for those able and willing to venture forth.  Admittedly, as less enthusiastic reviewers have pointed out here and elsewhere, Vollmann can seem long-winded, wanting of an editor, and somewhat superficial in terms of character morality, etc.  Personally, I take my time with books, and enjoy the lengthy narratives, twists and turns, use of chronologies, maps, lengthy source notes, whimsical drawings, so on and so forth.  I feel like I've got my money's worth.  (As one should for a $40 coverprice!).  In terms of morality, I think Vollmann (as a post-modern writer) comes across as dry and lacking \\"wisdom\\" in any deep moral sense, as compared to say the Victorian-era writers such as Tolstoy and Dickens not because he can't feel or provide insight into his characters, but because: 1. it would be disingenuous given the subject & overall plan of the Seven Dreams, and 2. it frees up YOU, the reader to interact with the text using your own values and judgments without the author getting in the way.

Larbaud's nostalgic novella takes place outside Paris, in a private prep-school similar to one which the author himself attended.  Fermina is a new student from South America (exotic foreign lands) from a wealthy family (like all the students at this particular school) and immediately enraptures young Leniot, as well as the more suave and brash Mexican student, Santos Iturria.  At first it seems that the story will be about a conflict between Santos and Joanny for the attention of Fermina, but it soon becomes clear that Larbaud is more interested in those forgotten subtleties of youth that are so obscured by middle-age: romance, self-aggrandizement, and turbulent emotions.  Upon meeting Fermina we learn of Fermina's religious impulse (similar to Franny, from Salinger's \\"Franny & Zooey\\"), and its interesting juxtaposition with Joanny's \\"Caesar complex\\" (similiar to the Machiavellian complex of Somerset Maugham's character, Simon in \\"Christmas Holiday\\").  Great writers always seem to be able to recreate scenarios and scenes lived but often forgotten in the course of one's life, and to throw in interesting characters and subtleties which are not always obvious, but there nonetheless.  Larbaud seems to be one of the better observers of youth I've read (see also, \\"Childish Things\\" which is a beautiful collection of short stories related to youth).  Fermina Marquez is no exception, and though it's a little rough around the edges, dwelling upon the trivialities of Joanny's obsession with Roman literature and times, it ends strongly and with many poetic, philosophical passages akin to the tantalizingly scarce writings of fellow Frenchman, Eugene Radiguet.  For example, when Fermina finally confronts her own romantic feelings for Santos while struggling with her religous feelings she is up late one night:  \\"The night hours have a romantic side. Two o'clock in the afternoon is prosaic, almost common; but two o'clock in the morning is an adventurer plunging into the unknown.\\"  Or, on the very last page when the nameless narrator is revisiting his school after many years, reminiscing about Fermina Marquez's impact on all the young men, a dilapidated building is \\"...wide open to today's sunshine, to the sky's blue: this Parisian sky, so astir with activity, with mists, vapours, halo of lights, balloons and Sundays.\\"<br /><br />Fermina Marquez is Larbaud's first novel, I believe, published in 1911, just before his more popular, and reknown \\"Diary of A.O. Barnabooth\\".  Like Radiguet, Larbaud is one of those mostly obscure French writers from the early 20th century who don't get much attention these days unless you seek them out yourself. Larbaud is interesting in part because he was very wealthy, made many important translations of English authors into French, including James Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\", and was friends with Andre Gide and Sylvia Beech (Shakespeare & Co.), etc.  If you enjoy obscure, but once influental writers you'll enjoy Larbaud.  He is definitely a unique character living, and writing mostly in the \\"Belle Epoque\\" period just before WWI.  Being stingy with my \\"star-ratings\\" I gave Fermina Marquez three not because it's \\"okay\\" or \\"not great\\" but because it's really a minor-classic, and to me, similar in quality and depth to some of my favorite \\"B-grade\\" Somerset Maugham novels like the one I mentioned above - all enjoyable and worthy of attention, just not of full-fledged literary classic caliber.  In any event, check out Larbaud; and Fermina Marquez is a good place to start because if you do find the romantic quality in it that I have, you'll probably want to keep it in your library forever.feelings for Santos while struggling with her religous feelings she is up late one night:  \\"The night hours have a romantic side.

Fathers & Crows is long, and long-winded, however if you're up to the task and looking for a very interesting journey into New France (Canada) as it was in the early 17th Century, then this is the book you've been looking for.  Without going into detail about William Vollmann or his 7 Dreams project (see my review of THE ICE SHIRT, vol. 1) I should point out that this is a blend of history and post-modern novel writing.  Time is skewed in such a way that the characters (such as Champlain, Poutrincourt, or Pere Brebeuf, for example) are sometimes walking through modern day Quebec and not realizing it.  As in The Ice Shirt, Vollmann occasionally blends his contemporary experiences traveling in and around Montreal into the \\"plot\\" (though there's not really a plot in any traditional sense here) is very effective in adding perspective into the history which has taken place, and CONTINUES to take place.  Even Jesus, St. Ignatious de Loyola (especially), and Roberto de Nobili arrive on stage here!  And special mention to the converted \\"Savages\\" such as Amantacha, Joseph Chiwatenah, and Catherine Tekakwitha.<br /><br />Fathers and Crows is about the French colonization of Canada, and begins almost 500 years later, after the Vikings left the continent in failure (but not before bringing the Ice Shirt).  Not long after Columbus arrived, French explorers such as Cabot, and then the map-obsessed Champlain, along with the Poutrincourts and the Pontgraves, sailed along the Fleuve St. Laurent and founded small outposts in what is modern day Quebec.  From the very beginning they encountered native American peoples such as the Algonkins, Huron, and the dreaded Iroquois.  The French, unlike the English in Virgnia (see vol. 3, ARGALL) attempted to assimilate these various tribes, mainly through trade (IRON for BEAVER pelts) and most importantly, through submission to CHRISTIANITY.  Thus, the Grey Gowns (the Recollects) and later on, the more successful Black Gowns, or JESUITS.<br /><br />Now you can read a straight-forward history on this time period in another place by a traditional historian, but after having read The Ice Shirt and now Fathers & Crows, I'm convinced that Vollmann's Seven Dreams are excellent blends of history and modern travelouge, along with personal experience (and a predisposition to favor women in the form of prostitutes), and extensive research into personalities, events, technologies, religion, and mythology.  Sometimes he may play a little \\"loose\\" with time frames, but he documents just about everything somewhere in his 100+ pages of Glossary notes!<br /><br />On a final note, it's not necessary to start with Vol. 1 at all -if the subject of first encounters between Europeans & Native Americans; Jesuits, French explorers, French Canada, or anything at all to do with North American cultural history (and legacy) interests you, then this a great book (and series) to own.  You'll dream of floating down Canadian rivers, or ascending the rapids with the Jesuit Peres doing St. Ignatius' \\"EXERCISES\\" (around which the total drama unfolds, as it did with Ice and Frost and varioous \\"shirts\\" of reality in vol. 1).<br /><br />Unbelievable that this amazing novel has so few reviews (but, actually, maybe not given the sad state of most American reader's attention spans anymore - oh well, too bad - YOU'RE ALL MISSING OUT!).  For those who do find their way here, give Fathers & Crows a shot.  Yes, it's long-winded and you may get bored and say \\"enough\\"!  Fine.  If not, like me, you might just paddle on in your canoe and find yourself hooked, and learning a heck of a lot of new and mostly obscured or glossed over (or simply forgotten) history which will tell you EVERYTHING about who we are as North Americans today.  Happy voyages, eh!  Next up:  ARGALL.obscured or glossed over (or simply forgotten) history which will tell you EVERYTHING about who we are as North Americans today.  Happy voyages, eh!

It is a modern re-telling of the very first encounter between Europeans and Native North Americans (no, it was not Columbus - it was Leif Ericson who \\"discovered\\" America). Actually, as Vollmann relates, it was Bjarni Herjolfsson who first sighted \\"Vinland\\" around 986 AD, and by 1000 AD Leif and his fellow Norsemen built settlements on what today is known as Newfoundland. It was all undone, fairly rapidly, by the same forces which brought them there, and especially through the wicked conduit of Leif's own bastard sister, Freydis Eiriksdottir, who truly \\"brought the frost\\" to North America.<br /><br />Beyond a post-modern recreation of myth and history, William Vollmann adds his own contemporary experiences while traveling in the lands he intimately describes. The Ice Shirt is very much a book about the land itself, and Vollmann spends great amounts of time and care writing about the local flora, fauna, and how it relates to the people themselves. The \\"shirts\\", as you will see, are our personas, and spirits. They are \\"the change\\" in change, and it is the SPIRIT of the lands which Vollmann captures, and the manner in which he blends this together with his own street-level point of view, I think, which makes this an intriguing modern day Saga. Now, it's quite possible after reading this book that you'll disagree with me and think Vollmann over-rated, or perhaps even an \\"awful\\" writer, but I bet it would be based on your taste in literature rather than the real quality or scope of the work itself; because this undertaking of his, as far as I know is unprecedented, and will surely one day be considered masterful. At first, because Vollmann came very highly recommended to me about a decade ago, I felt I had to force myself through the first 70 pages or so, namely because I've never read anyone quite like this before and his post-modernist style can take a little getting used to depending on one's reading experience. In addition, the first part of The Ice Shirt (and thus, his whole series) is a lengthy tome on Viking blood feuds, revenge, massacres, political assassinations, executions, raping and pillaging, etc. etc. - with no end in sight - making it a little trying for the unconverted. Because it is all written in saga-like style, this whole section entitled \\"The Changers\\" could easily be mistaken for one of the original Viking sagas. What's great about The Ice Shirt (and Vollmann), as I discovered while reading, is that the book is not pedantic or high-brow in any way. Sometimes subject-matter like this comes across in history books as being overly specialized, complex, and erudite because the writer has some agenda to push, or something to prove; or maybe is just trying to write a scholarly work. Blah! The Ice Shirt & THE SEVEN DREAMS is something new, different, and original. The scope seems outlandishly unwieldy, but somehow Vollmann manages to keep it all glued together.  When you come across passages entitled \\"San Francisco Transvestites - 1987\\" sandwiched between \\"The Storm, the Spirit and the Island\\" and \\"The Woman Shirt\\" you'll see what I mean. There are plenty of informative source notes in which the author tells you exactly what he's up to, and then there are hand-drawn maps to guide you further, glossaries filled with people and places, and a chronology for good measure, so that you don't get too lost. And yet it all works! That's the amazing thing.<br /><br />Perhaps you, like me knew of Vollmann's reputation as a trendy, avant-garde writer of prostitutes and grimy street life. And also like me, were put off by this. For this very reason it took me ten years to give this book a shot (if you see my reviews for all of 2004, this is the Capstone). In fact, if you look you'll find some funny and interesting comments from various reviewers who've struggled with his other books - some of the comments which I tended to agree with at first. For example, from \\"The Atlas\\" on 3/2/02: \\"Self-Conciously Avant Garde\\"; \\"Beauty in Ugliness\\"; \\"Great Ideas in Books\\". From \\"The Royal Family\\" on 12/29/03: \\"An Interesting Waste of Time\\". And one of my favorites from 4/6/02 about \\"Argall\\", because I agreed with it ten years ago: \\"Vollmann's Career-Revenge of the Nerd\\" in which the reviewer harps on the whole Vollmann phenomenon. Finally, from the Ice Shirt reviews on 9/13/98 comes one which states: \\"Not Sure What it's About, But it Ain't a Novel!\\". Well, sir, I suppose that all depends on your notion of what a \\"novel\\" is. So, before beginning this series I needed to forget the reputation of the man, the phenomenon hype, and just get to the work itself, which always intrigued me: A Symbolic History of North America. (But of course, it's a little harder to forget that the guy writing all this had been known for his lurid, hard-hitting stories on drugs, sex, gangs, and prostituties!).<br /><br />Having done so at last, I can now say that I'm very pleased with The Ice Shirt; and am now hooked on THE SEVEN DREAMS! While Vollmann does have a wildly crazy bio, and some fascinating news and magazine articles, not to mention a massive research project on Violence called \\"Rising Up, Rising Down\\" as well as another lengthy foray into SF street life titled \\"The Royal Family\\" which I understand is the third in a so-called \\"Prostitution Trilogy\\" . . . I leave it to you, new reader, to come to The Ice Shirt with an open mind about what a novel is and isn't, and of course, an interest in a deeper understanding of what it means to be a North American.

US	38794152	R2MNAWFSMUBKVQ	0316769029	551899474	Franny and Zooey	Books	5	13	15	N	N	"I'm afraid I will compete - that's what scares me."	So says Franny to her college beau, Lane in response to his wondering why she quit acting in school. I love this line; and many more. After having read Catcher in the Rye & some of his short stories back in high-school (many years ago), I finally found the right time & place to pick up where I left off with Salinger. Franny & Zooey is a wonderful \\"second novel\\", and recaptured much of the plain language & straight-forward conversational rhythm that I remembered enjoying while reading Catcher in the Rye. There are lots of interesting reviews here about this book and how it's affected people. I truly understand now, how reading an important book at different stages of one's life can take on new significance, often in very different ways from the initial reading. Since this is my first time through Franny & Zooey, I feel obligated to compare it to Catcher. The many similarities between the two novels include the age of the main characters (college), connections with acting or actors/\\"hollywood\\", addiction to cigarettes (is there a single line in this book not spoken without a cigarette in hand?), and the confessional nature of conversation in which \\"family\\" looms large. But while Holden Caulfield, Franny, & Zooey all complain about the \\"phonyness\\" of the world around them, Holden seems (as I recall - it's been twelve years since I last read Catcher) more preoccupied with youth & preservation, while Franny & Zooey delve into religion. Ultimately, Franny & Zooey is about an existential crisis - Franny's hunger for religion & truth while feeling overwhelmed by the superficiality of pedantic professors, erudite intellectuals, and, well, her \\"lame\\" boyfriend himself. She is so overwhelmed that she faints at the restaurant.<br /><br />Enter Zooey. Zooey is a bit of an intellectual himself, as is the whole Glass family. Thus, the ironical nature of much of Zooey's \\"speaches\\". Salinger lets Zooey be long-winded and he takes up most of the novel. I think some readers might be put of by this, and it can be a trifle tiresome at times, but it does end up \\"feeling right\\" afterwards when Zooey's child-prodigy monster of a character shows its true colours. This unique characterization is one reason why Salinger is recognized as a great American writer. In any event, despite his condesending treatment of his mother, which comes across as strange, mean, and funny all at once, Zooey is ultimately just being himself. This monster, Salinger seems to be saying, is exactly what his parents \\"Les & Bess\\" have created. We learn that the oldest kid, Seymour has committed suicide, and the second oldest, Buddy, has moved far away (but is present in the form of a letter & in spirit). Zooey is taking a bath, smoking, and reading his big brothers letter. It looks like Buddy has thankfully \\"escaped\\" the grasp of this obsessive family - run Buddy, run! (Before leaving the bathroom, make sure you note Salinger's precise description of the medicine cabinet's contents - there are some telling details there). Ultimately, Zooey makes his way out to the living room (also described in excellent detail) where lays Franny, curled up in a ball with the family cat. By the end, the slightly older but more immature Zooey is finally acting like a big-brother should (although tellingly, incapable of a face to face conversation - you'll have to read & see for yourself), and manages to display some real wisdom. The conversation between the two of them revolves around the nature of ego, and religious impulse, and Zooey consults with his memories of Seymour & Buddy (his gurus, whether he likes it or not) in order to calm Franny down. He's been through it, and understands her very well. He tells her not to make these signifcant issues out to be \\"so damn personal\\". It's a great moment too, when Zooey starts talking to Franny about \\"the Fat Lady\\".<br /><br />As I write this review which I didn't imagine would become this long-winded (Zooey has infected me!) I realize that this book is deeper than Catcher, and perhaps more significant. I'm actually more impressed with its simplicity than its deep & meaningful subject-matter. Salinger's \\"greatness\\" is his wonderful ability to capture the beauty in something as seemingly mundane as two college kids sitting at a table, smoking, eating \\"snails & frog-legs\\", sipping martinis, and talking about themselves. You'll have no problem reading this book in one or two sittings, and then you'll come away from it thinking, \\"Wow! I need to re-read that some day, in some other place & time.\\" I still hear the Zen-like clapping of Zooey's hand(s)...<br /><br />One final note about Salinger. My impression is that there is no way he intended to stop writing (and I don't think he did) after Raise High the Roofbeams, Carpenters & Seymour. Yes, he stopped \\"publishing\\", but Franny & Zooey just feels too much like one face of a complex prism - that prism ultimately being a whole book of stories & novellas dealing with the Glass family. There's so much missing, it seems, in terms of the other family members, and especially the Mother & Father themselves. My guess is that one day, perhaps after Salinger's death as he seems to intend, we will have multiple \\"Franny & Zooey's\\" to compliment & fill out this incongruously short Glass saga . . . I, for one, look forward to the discovery & printing (& glorious fanfare!!) of a NEW Salinger story.

US	38794152	R2NQ1TBAKSW2LC	0679724753	877262582	Out of Africa: and Shadows on the Grass	Books	4	84	91	N	N	Here I am, where I ought to be.	I'm another reader who comes to Out of Africa by way of Holden Caulfield in Catcher in the Rye; and it became recommended reading before I visited Kenya for myself in the early 90's.  So, having just finished it and now half way through Shadows on the Grass, my overall impression is a pleasant one.  I enjoyed Dinesen's writing style very much, and would agree with many readers that Out of Africa deserves a place among the classics in English literature.  It's Karen Blixen's memoirs of her time in Kenya around WWI, living and working on her coffee plantation near Nairobi.  Her descriptions of the Natives, her European friends, the land, the animals, flora and fauna are incredible.  The chapters shift back and forth in time, some focused on specific events and individuals, some more whimsical and anecdotal.  Reading Out of Africa transports the reader into early 20th Centrury colonial Kenya, and more concretely, onto Ms. Blixen's farm at the foot of the Ngong Hills.  Years later she takes up her time in Africa again in Shadows on the Grass, talking more about her loyal Somali servant & right-hand man, Farah, taking a more philosophical tone regarding \\"masters & slaves\\", Native superstitions, manners, and so on.  Shadows is inferior in many ways to Out of Africa, and it feels more like an \\"addendum\\" to the main work, which is poetry by comparison.  By the time she writes it, she seems to have grown slightly more distant, and well, Colonist European.<br /><br />As for Out of Africa, if you've seen the movie version and are looking for it here you're in for a surprise because the book contains no overt romance between Karen & Denys, nor mention of siphylous, nor much in the way of Karen's own personal life.  Her ex-husband, Bror is almost non-existant.  That makes sense seeing that she wrote under a pseudonym for whatever reaons.  Still, I was slightly disappointed not to find more personal thoughts or emotions from her, or discussions regarding the politcal, historical, or economic backdrop of Kenya.  Or the workings of the coffee business there.  (I have yet to read it, but from what I gather \\"Uhuru\\" by Robert Ruark is an excellent novel dealing with these types of affairs in Kenya in the next generations after Blixen, in the 1950's & 1960's).  Also, Blixen is very much a product of the times and her colonial attitudes and mindset sometimes come across as condescending or negative towards the Africans (mostly in certain passages in Shadows though).  However, I do believe that in her frequent comparisons between the animals, land, and Natives Blixen is actually praising and admiring the people, not being racist or mean, as one reviewer here claims.  She frequently praises the Kikuyus, Masai, and Somali she lives with for their numerous attributes (as well as the European settlers) and for their simplicity and harmony with nature, versus the repressed and \\"civilized\\" Europe she comes from.  One other thing that's different from the movie is her attitude towards hunting.  In the movie it's as though she doesn't hunt at all, but in the book she specifically mentions her intitial desire to shoot one of every kind of local game (though she does later express some distaste for hunting, she remains enthusiastic about shooting lions, comparing it in Shadows to \\"a declaration of love\\" and hunting to being a sort of \\"love-affair\\").  She means respect, but oh how the times have changed now with all the big game enthusiasts shooting game with . . . cameras from pop-top mini-vans!<br /><br />Once I let go of the movie (its own masterpiece of beauty & cinematography) and my intellectual curiosities, and came to accept Blixen's memoir as it is, I enjoyed it more and more as I read on.  I took my time reading it, savoring it, and reflecting upon my own safari experience (with a camera) in Kenya not too many years ago, and found much to admire and contemplate in her writings, even if from a different era.  While Out of Africa isn't especially deepor philosphical, nor dramatic or emotional, it somehow comes across as a grand novel, and there are moments when all of the above hit you.  This is due primarily, I think, to Blixen's having lived a fascinating life in a unique period and place, and knowing how to tell a story without overdoing it - she just writes her own experiences.  One good example of this balance can be found in one of my favorite chapters entitled, \\"A Fugitive Rests on the Farm\\" from Part III.  In it, a Swedish immigrant and traveler named Emmanuelson stays briefly on Karen's farm, discusses his lonely and peripatetic life with her, and eventually walks off into the Masai reserve all alone, putting his fate into God & the Masai's hands.  The sparse detail and images are great.  Likewise, her rememberances with Denys Fitch-Hatton are wonderfuly scenic and memorable as well, and subtly romantic.  All the vignettes she relates are mostly undramatic, straight-forward, and  though unforgettable.  Out of Africa is a unique literary memoir and journal of a diverse group of people come together in one specific place and time, bonded together by the very soil in which the coffee trees they lived for were once planted, and live on in these organic pages.y deep or philosphical, nor dramatic or emotional, it somehow comes across as a grand novel, and there are moments when all of the above hit you.

In short, \\"Beneath the Wheel\\" is 29 year old Hermann Hesse's attack on the educational system of his day.  Unfortunately, too many youths (and adults) in our own contemporary society continue to be crushed by parents & teachers with personal agendas at odds with individuality.  This is most harmful in youths because they haven't been given an opportunity to explore or pursue themselves, and who often wind up emotionally stunted throughout their adult lives.  Now as far as Hesse goes, he is one of my favorite authors, and I'd love to give this book more than three measly stars.  However I don't think \\"Unterm Rad\\" (\\"Beneath the Wheel\\", aka: \\"The Prodigy\\") is nearly as interesting as his later works.  I even think his earlier novel \\"Peter Camenzind\\", though less developed, is more enjoyable.  Still, there are some good reasons to read this book.  Though it was written after \\"Peter Camenzind\\" it details an earlier period of Hesse's life.  Like Hans Giebenrath, Hesse was miserably unsatisfied with the pressures and direction of his early schooling.  Hans' father (like Hesse, his mother was deceased early in his life) and the local village community push Hans to excel in the state examinations.  His required studies include Latin, German, Greek & mathematics.  Hans is a very sensitive and emotional boy who prefers poetry, art, and the simple pleasures of fishing to the rigid manner in which he taught the classics he otherwise enjoys immensely.  Although Hesse doesn't go into great character depth with Hans, it's plain for all to see that he's stressed out and unhappy.  He is even denied a summer vacation in between schools in favor of preparatory study.  When he does manage to advance into the Maulbronn Seminary we experience \\"college\\" (boarding school) student life with Hans.  He befriends a rebellious boy named Heilner who is a stock-type in many of Hesse's novels, and who represents the person Hesse actually wanted to be, or strove to be, as opposed to the protagonist who is always the person he believed himself to be.  Hermann Heilner (note the similarity in name with Hermann Hesse) is eventually kicked out of school for his obstinance and basically disappears from the scene, but remains largely in the consience of Hans.  Heilner is similar to Richard from \\"Peter Camenzind\\", except that he does not \\"die\\" here.  Richard represented an intellectual & bohemian aspect of Hesse's life after college that he felt required to \\"shed\\" in order to grow into the \\"respectable\\" & \\"responsible\\" married man he became in and around 1905.  If you read enough of Hesse's works you'll find that all of his novels pick up where the previous one left off in terms of inner-development.  So for example, Hesse separates Heilner from Hans because he needs to take Hans to his natural conclusion right here and now, before returning to the Heilner in him in \\"Gertrude\\", \\"Rosshalde\\", and then \\"Demian\\", and so forth.  Hans and Richard never completely leave Hesse or his future protagonists, but play smaller and less significant parts of their lives in the same way we grow older and (hopefully!) develop into wiser, more complex individuals.<br /><br />Literary analysis aside, \\"Beneath the Wheel\\" is Hesse's second full-length novel and you'll find him here building strength as a writer and artist; especially through his vivid descriptions of German Black Forest village life, the refreshing natural scenery always comforting and reflecting individual psychology, and a little bit in the colorful depictions of local characters and dialogue.  Although I find \\"Peter Camenzind\\" more interesting as a novel, \\"Unterm Rad\\" is more well written and developed than \\"Peter Camenzind\\" which comes across as fragmented and incomplete.  Both novels deal with the real, inner-life of youth and are morose, and depressing at times.  No one reads Hesse for humor though.  He has been aptly described as a \\"biographer of the soul\\", and I think this is why he appeals to so many individuals throughout time and country.  \\"Beneath the Wheel\\" presents two important characters in the Hesse universe, all the more important for representing the early stages of individual human development amidst an indifferent and sometimes damaging social-system.  Young Hans, like so many of us at one time or another struggles with the pressures of callous parents, neighbors, teachers, and society in general.  He has to confront peer pressure, awkwardness in balancing his desires with what's desired of him, and the strangeness and power of first-love and sexuality.  He excels in spite of himself, is on the \\"track\\", and a part of the system.  He then falls off, and now suddenly must handle disappointment for the first time in his life.  How will he deal with these unforseen (but predicatble) obstacles?  This is the dark, mysterious realm where true character strength, courage, resillence, individuality, and beauty are forged in man & woman alike.  Sadly, it is also the unknown realm which comfortable, status-quo, pigeon-holing, stereotypical, automaton producing society opposes, fears, and needs to repress, crush, and see defeated in order to vindicate itself.<br /><br />Thankfully, this will not happen as long as there are friends & soul-mates of writers like Hesse who continue to stand up for the demands and freedoms of individuality amidst the larger, impersonal society Hesse eventually comes to have great hope for in \\"The Journey to the East\\" and \\"The Glass Bead Game\\".throughout time and country.  \\"Beneath the Wheel\\" presents two important characters in the Hesse universe, all the more important for representing the early stages of individual human development amidst an indifferent and sometimes damaging social-system.

US	38794152	R3OHYR69HSU36A	0520043545	500907885	Moby Dick; or, The Whale	Books	5	14	15	N	N	"I'd smite the sun if it insulted me"	Easily one of the greatest novels of all-time.  Ignore the stereotyped responses by reviewers who complain about Melville's odd writing style, the length of the novel, or its circuitous nature.  And don't get caught up in the \\"symbolism\\" of it all either.  That'll come later.  My suggestion is that you read Moby Dick for the shear thrill of the hunt.  Melville has created a very strange and surreal book, which is a must read for anyone serious about American literature.  In my case, I don't think I'd have been able to get through it before now (I'm in my early thirties) and I'm very glad I came back to it.  That said, Melville's many chapters on early 19th Century whaling, and the whalemen themselves are interesting in and of themselves for both the historically curious, and the adventure seekers among Melville's readers.  On the whole, Moby Dick is constructed like a great tile mosaic; or more precisely, it has the \\"counter-pane\\" structure of the Quaker bed-quilt he describes in Chapter 4 (there are many references to cross-hatched patterns & weavings throughout the novel).  Moby Dick, the White Whale, is Ahab's bane.  We meet neither Ahab nor Moby Dick until we've been taken far out to sea.  This slow build-up is Melville's divine plan.  He entices us throughout with brief essay after essay on all subjects and objects and personalities related to the Pequod, whaling, and Nantucket whalers, and whales themselves.  If at first you have trouble with Melville's writing style, read on and you will find yourself soothed by his unique poetic sermons.  The combination of these many short, sometimes non-sequential chapters all forged together, creates a rhythmic ebb and flow of diverse ocean tides, rising and falling waves, and rapidly changing weather.  There are squalls, rushes after whales, followed by dead calm and placid tranquility.  One forgets what and where he is going on this strange voyage.  It becomes difficult to tell whether or not the story is beginning, ending, or somewhere in between; or, if it's a \\"story\\" at all!  Very odd indeed (unlike any other novel I've ever read).  And then we hear a voice; a harsh voice.  It is Ahab, stumbling on deck, reminding us exactly what we're in for:  vengeance and hate.  Pure and simple.  Forget \\"Cliff's Notes\\" or lame \\"abridged\\" versions of Moby Dick; listen to Ahab speak himself:  \\"He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him outrageous strength, with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate; and be the White Whale agent, or be the White Whale principal, I will wreak hate upon him . . . I'd smite the sun if it insulted me\\" (Ch. 29).  These are some of the most amazing lines in all of literature.  Ahab continues:  \\"For could the sun do that, then could I do the other; since there is ever a sort of fair play herein, jealousy presiding over all creations. But not my master, man, is even that fair play. Who's over me? Truth hath no confines. Take off thine eye! more intolerable than fiends' glarings is a doltish stare!\\"  With this Ahab avoids mutiny.  With this he binds First Mate Starbuck and the rest of the crew to his purpose.  Who's over me?  Who and what exactly is Moby Dick?  Who is Ahab?  Read, enjoy, and go with the flow, like Ishmael following his passion out to the intrepid sea and away from mundane land-lubber life.  Let yourself drift with Melville for a few weeks, slowly absorbing his amazing prose, letting yourself dissolve into his infinite, timeless ocean, watching, listening, and observing old, mutilated Captain Ahab, peering out to sea, and up into the three tall mastheads at us - his crew - all on the look out for . . .ing, or somewhere in between; or, if it's a \\"story\\" at all!

Three stars means this is a good novel (well worth reading), but only mediocre in relation to the more highly developed and complex novels Hesse would begin writing with Demian, or perhaps even Rosshalde.  Peter Camenzind is a bildungsroman (a novel of youth) mirroring Hesse's own youth, making it an essential novel to read if you're at all interested in Hesse's development as an author (this is his first full-length novel).  It stands on its own as an interesting biography of a young man's life journey, relating his unique and picturesque village life in the Swiss Alps, his first romantic love interests, hopes, dreams, and aspirations.  We follow Peter Camenzind from his rural village life into the city life of a student, traveller, and worker.  He meets various influential personalities along the way, especially the student Richard, with whom he has many artistic and philosophical discussions in cafes and taverns.  Wandering in Tuscany, he will be taken in by the sweet Signora Nardini with whom he spends many fruitful hours; and in the end, will meet and care for Boppi, a helpless hunchback who will change his life forever.<br /><br />The deeper purpose of this novel seems clear when one looks at it as a sort of therapeutic expurgation by a 26 year old Hesse.  On the whole it is somewhat scattered and unbalanced, and I wished that the characters Peter meets were more fully developed (especially the women).  Sometimes the peripheral scenery begs for more detail and interaction (for example, Hesse skips out on Peter's Parisian adventures altogether!).  Nevertheless, there are many poetic and sentimental flourishes here which are extraordinarily delightful to read, making Peter Camenzind a diamond in the rough.  Most importantly, you'll find Hesse's own lifelong statement of purpose in Chapter 7: \\"As you know, it had been my hope to write a work of some length in which I intended to bring closer to people the grandiose and mute life of nature, that they might love it.\\"  This type of novel which focuses on one individual's growth is common in German and European literature and is a genre some American readers may or may not find enjoyable.  I for one, find them highly interesting and instructional because of their absolute concentration upon one individual's life and times, and often find myself attached to the main character by the end of the novel; which was the case with Peter Camenzind even on my second reading.  Read Peter Camenzind for Hesse's burgeoning poetry, the introduction of themes and motifs such as the quest for religion and meaning, which he will repeat later on, and most importantly, for the shear pleasure of reading a quality novel you will want to read more than once.As you know, it had been my hope to write a work of some length in which I intended to bring closer to people the grandiose and mute life of nature, that they might love it.\\"  This type of novel which focuses on one individual's growth is common in German and European literature and is a genre some American readers may or may not find enjoyable.

If you're into poetry, and looking for an interesting and brief collection of what was being written in America during the middle-half of the 20th century (and thus, highly influential upon our own) than this Penguin anthology is a great book to own.  In his introduction, written in 1961, Donald Hall distinguishes \\"new\\" American poetry as being \\"subjective\\" rather than \\"autobiographical\\".  \\"It reveals through images not particular pain, but general subjective life.\\"  The poems of this era (roughly the 1950's & early 1960's) are best described as \\"expressionistic\\" - they have their own language and feeling best understood and felt if the reader is open to them. Like a painter \\"...the poet uses fantasy and distortion to express feeling.\\"<br /><br />I like this anthology because it contains a number of American poets I was unfamiliar with and wanted to know.  Each poet is represented fairly well, mostly with four or more poems.  Stafford, Lowell, Wilbur, Bly, Creeley, Ginsberg, Ashbery, Sexton, Wright, Rich, Snyder, and Plath are some of the more well-known names in American poetry you'll find here. But the rest are just as interesting for being less known and \\"new\\". Reading these poets all together, one gains a basic idea of what kinds of movements, directions, and experiments were happening in poetry at this time, leading into and influencing ours. A number of lines strike me in a meaningful or thought-provoking way, and I enjoy the way many of these poets make one see and feel in a new and different light. Well worth the time and effort of any knowledgable poet or poetry lover.	2004-08-14

After seeing that there were already some 40 or so reviews of this wonderful book, and having read it some years ago I was reluctant to add another. But, being a fan of Gould's magnificent &quot;Wonderful Life&quot; (1989) and seeing some negative, and misleading reviews of this particular book, I had to chime in. To begin with, Gould's books are highly readable and enjoyable as he has a great capacity to relate objective science to the subjective world. &quot;Full House&quot; will be challenging to you if you do not already understand or buy into Darwinism. If not, you'll definitely take issue with his seemingly harsh conclusions (i.e. &quot;Humans are here by the luck of the draw, not the inevitability of life's direction or evolution's mechanism&quot; p.175). The book is about diversity and &quot;the spread of excellence&quot; on earth. Consequently, it puts man in his place (just another organism amongst many, and quite minor compared to bacteria) amongst greater geologic history; and this can be a bit difficult to swallow at first. But read on!<br /><br /> Utilizing baseball and the disappearance of .400 ave. hitting as one major example to illustrate the nature of evolution, Gould shows through statistics how one aspect of the game (hitting) has declined over time, while the rest (pitching & fielding) have increased in skill level. It all makes perfect sense. That's not to say one can't argue with him (although he's now dead), but Gould's contributions to evolutionary theory can be controversial to the unconverted - especially the religious (namely, Catholics & those with firmly held, comfortable beliefs in Manifest Desitiny). Gould (and most science) is directly opposed to this type of anthropocentric thinking; but not, however, traditional Deist beliefs in which God does not interfere with human evolution. In many regards, &quot;Wonderful Life&quot; and &quot;Full House&quot; comfortably fit into an older, more original Christianity - that of Gnosticism, in which the earth is a sort of abandoned proving ground. Gould conjectures: &quot;...perhaps we are, whatever our glories and accomplishments, a momentary cosmic accident that would never rise again if the tree of life could be replanted from seed and regrown under similar conditions&quot; p.18.<br /><br /> The premiss of &quot;Full House&quot; is that &quot;progress is, nonetheless, a delusion based on social prejudice and psychological hope engendered by our unwillingness to accept the plain (and true) meaning of the fourth Freudian revolution&quot; p.20. Later on, Gould reiterates: &quot;The vaunted progress of life is really random motion away from simple beginnings, not directed impetus toward inherently advantageous complexity&quot; p.173. He could be wrong. He could be right. He does however back up his ideas with plenty of observable proofs, experience (he was a paleontologist), and statistics - all in Gould's entertaining and thought-provoking signature style. The fact is, neither Gould nor Darwin nor Freud is saying a person ought to stop striving for excellence - in fact, they're encouraging it! Reading a book like &quot;Full House&quot;, or &quot;Wonderful Life&quot; is challenging to many commonly held assumptions about human life, and thus, potentially upsetting, but ultimately uplifting in my view. One optimistic conclusion that may be drawn from this seemingly dismal and dry evolutionary theory is that our life is a unique, wonderful opportunity unparalleled, and definitely not the norm of things.<br /><br /> If the above quotes from the book sound intriguing to you, and you're craving more information, then I highly recommend you try both &quot;Full House&quot; and it's paradigm shifting predecessor, &quot;Wonderful Life&quot;. I guarantee that you'll come away with a mind more open, and thoughtful about evolution and life than ever before. Happy reading!in which the earth is a sort of abandoned proving ground.

Wheelan does a great job explaining the nuts and bolts of a free market system, and why this economic system as it stands is currently the most successful in the world. He's devoted chapters to the power of markets, incentives, the government, information, productivity, human capital, finance, the federal reserve, organized interests, trade and globalization, and ends with a discussion as to what it would take for poorer, less developed countries to get out of poverty. After reading Thomas Sowell's, &quot;Basic Economics&quot; I found Charles Wheelan's writing to be refreshingly balanced, and more humorous. That said, I still think both writers and books are worth-while. Anyone unconvinced that a free market system is the best economic system available, or wishing to know more about the system in which we live ought to read these books. Especially if you're against free trade, and fear &quot;globablization&quot;. Wheelan admits there are serious social consequences and problems related to bad government, but insinuates (with a little more finesse than Sowell) that the problems are mostly rooted in bad policies, not economics. Corruption and dishonest politicians and leaders impoverish countries, not capitalism itself. However you choose to look at these issues, I think Wheelan does an excellent job at providing the fundamentals of the world in which we operate on a daily basis, and reading &quot;Naked Economics&quot; can only help one understand how to better affect desired change. Every college student should be required to read this!	2004-07-26

Etymologically, the words &quot;work&quot;, &quot;job&quot;, or &quot;labor&quot; denote pain, sorrow, or heavy, burdensome tasks. Thus, in &quot;My Job, My Self&quot; Al Gini wonders: &quot;So why, given our poverty of time and the burdens of work, haven't we traded our prosperity for leisure?&quot; (p. 141). One answer provided by Gini in this thorough expose on everything &quot;job/work&quot;, is that most of us no longer work out of a sense of duty, necessity, or utilitarian pleasure; nor hunger or the satisfactions of craftsmanship or pleasures of a job well done. Sadly, we no longer seem capable of knowing what exactly to do with our free-time, and find ourselves more often than naught, bored, wanting, and desiring things only more money can buy. We have become a nation of culture consumers: &quot;Emo, ergo sum&quot;/&quot;I shop, therefore I am&quot;, (p. 140).<br /><br /> The main thrust of &quot;My Job, My Self&quot; is not to propose some vague utopian elimination of work altogether, but rather to acknowledge the importance that modern society places on work, and to show how we have come to identify ourselves through our jobs. If our jobs are so vital to who we are, then we really ought to pay more attention to what exactly we're getting out of them. Gini admits that, &quot;Work will never be completely free of disappointment, drudgery, and toil, but all work should, at least, offer the possibility of purpose and hope&quot; (p.224).<br /><br /> &quot;My Job, My Self&quot; is an enlightening journey through a subject many readers read books to escape from in the first place! Yet, our jobs consume so much of our time and lives that only a straight-forward examination of what we do, and why we do it, can be therapeutic - and quite possibly life-changing. &quot;My Job, My Self&quot; is rounded off with insightful chapters on subjects such as race, women in the workplace, time and stress issues related to workaholism, and the importance of ethics and leadership. In general, it contains sound socio-economic discussion related to the nature of work itself, and the worker's relation to it in an increasingly technologically driven economy. Read, reflect, and arm yourself with your new-found revelations, for &quot;without love, work is servitude&quot; (p.224).kplace, time and stress issues related to workaholism, and the importance of ethics and leadership.

Precisely so; that is just what we intend.\\"  -Marx, p.98<br />Class warfare, abolishment of private property, violent revolution - a course of action expressly advocated by Marx & Engels in \\"The Communist Manifesto\\".  All bad ideas with really bad consequences, as recorded and witnessed in the 20th Century.  This brief philosophical tract was put together specifically as a prelude to action during the revolutions of 1848.  In his excellent introduction to the manifesto, AJP Taylor writes: \\"The Marxist system was a propagandist myth, deceptively adorned with scientific analysis\\" (p.27).  He says Marx was \\"essentially a prophet, not a philosopher,\\"  and introduces Marxism as \\"a series of dogmas [written] with a deceptive air of obvious truth\\" (p.28).<br />One can argue for or against Marxism all they want.  What one can't do is argue the historical fact that it was written for a specific purpose, and failed in that purpose.  Over the past century various dictators posing as enlightened \\"leaders\\" have attempted to incorporate Marx's communist ideas into government economic and social policy, all with disastrous effects.  Communism was supposed to succeed capitalism, and eventually lead to the ideal of a socialist utopia.  One good reason why this didn't happen was because Marx miscalculated the benefits of a capitalist society in which incentives (i.e. private property, for example) matter a heck of a lot; as well as made naive assumptions about Europe's proletariat who simply wanted security and jobs, not revolution.  The problem with modern communism, as clearly indicated in Taylor's introduction, is that the middle-class \\"bourgeois\\" has greatly expanded in the free-market economic systems of the world, and all social \\"classes\\" have generally benefited with safer workplaces, higher wages, and a higher standard of living.  Of course, these benefits all depend on capable and honest politicians who know how to allow the free-market system to work, all the while taking \\"incentives\\" into account with each policy decision.  It's definitely no utopia we live in, but it's proved to be the most democratic and beneficial to the vast majority of participants.  For a more detailed economic explanation as to why state-controlled communist policy has failed where free market economic policy has triumphed, I highly recommend Thomas Sowell's, \\"Basic Economics\\" or Charles Wheelan's, \\"Naked Economics\\".  Both texts demystify economics as a science, and are written for the general lay-reader without complicated charts or graphs.<br /><br />None of this is to say \\"don't read Marx\\".  By all means, read \\"The Communist Manifesto\\" and reason it out for yourself! Marx & Engels offer acute insight into 19th Century labor and social thinking, some of which is clearly relevant to certain people and situations in America and the world today.  They are attempting to bring together the working classes of the world (\\"Working Men of All Countries Unite!\\") so as to rise up against a perceived injustice: a system in which workers (the \\"proletariat\\") were being abused by the well-to-do business class (i.e. the evil \\"bourgeoisie\\").  While there are plenty of weak assumptions to be challenged in Marxism, the \\"Communist Manifesto\\" is an important historical document which clearly delineates Marx & Engel's basic ideology, all within twelve thousand words!  Will capitalism eventually be replaced by some vague socialist utopia?  Marx thinks so, and his indictment of some of the many ills inherent in modern capitalist society include valid social issues such as product idolatry (\\"commodity fetishism\\"), inequitable distribution of wealth, \\"surplus value\\" and alientated labor. There are valuable egalitarian arguments within his works (see, \\"The Marx-Engels Reader\\" edited by Robert Tucker for a nice compendium) which continue to be unresolved for far too much of the world's population.  As long as this is so, the \\"spectre of communism\\" will most likely continue to haunt us.alid social issues such as product idolatry (\\"commodity fetishism\\"), inequitable distribution of wealth, \\"surplus value\\" and alientated labor.

This is his second, and last novel after the precocious and firey &quot;Le Diable du Corps&quot;; as he would die of typhoid fever in 1923 at the tender age of 20.  From the get go, early in Chapter 1 Radiguet states:  &quot;Every age bears its fruit, one must know how to gather it.&quot;  &quot;Le Bal du Comte d'Orgel&quot; is Radiguet's harvest.<br />Francois de Seryeuse is &quot;exactly his age&quot;; heedless and in love with the young Madame d'Orgel (Mahaut), a descendent of French-Martinque aristocracy.  But Francois respects and admires her vane husband, the thirty year old Anne d'Orgel as a friend.  Mahuat and Francois are soon delighted to discover that they are distant cousins, and thus brought a little closer to one another.  Since their first meeting at the Medrano Circus in February, 1920 they have been smitten with each other.  Francois &quot;thought her beautiful, disdainful and absent-minded.&quot;  Nevertheless, Mahuat is devoted and loyal to her husband even though he is seemingly indifferent to her.  Anne &quot;...began to love his wife from the moment he saw that Francois loved her, as though he needed the evidence of another man's desire to teach him her value.&quot;  As for Francois, &quot;The combination of [his] love and friendship brought about such a strange result, that he resolved to use all his influence with Orgel to make him love his wife better.&quot;<br />The beauty of this novel of internal drama lays in its delicacy of manner, and its concise, cubist/fauvist style.  Radiguet writes as though wielding a razor-sharp rapier in place of a pen.  Each sentence is laced with precise aphorisms and maxims, slashing, cutting, and thrusting into the psychology and motives of each character.  Wallace Fowlie in his classic &quot;Guide to Contemporary French Literature&quot; writes of both Radiguet and his elder friend, Cocteau:  &quot;Their purely descriptive passages are more swift and condensed than the swiftest in Stendhal. They are most skillful in their depiction of brief moments, brief encounters. They are interested primarily in taking candid camera shots of man's adventure. Pictures which will relieve the monotony of a too familiar story.&quot;  Radiguet's writing has been compared to that of Madame de Lafayette, and Choderlos de Laclos (&quot;Dangerous Laisons&quot;).  Elements of Balzac and Nietszche are apparent as well.  And yet, it's astounding to think such genius as this could come from one barely twenty years old!  But, as Radiguet himself states of the infernal poet Arthur Rimbaud:  &quot;It is Rimbaud's work and not the age at which he wrote it that astounds me. All great poets have written at seventeen. The greatest are those who succeed in making one forget it.&quot;  By Chapter 14 when Francois' and Mahaut's &quot;secret love&quot; becomes only slightly less secret as their arms magically entwine during a car ride with the Count; in Chapter 17 at a picnic on the Marne when the trio &quot;...received a warning and each one just missed discovering a part of the truth&quot;; and, later in Chapter 20 as the two kiss for only the second time, a kiss witnessed by Anne which was so &quot;made not to order&quot;, I became fully convinced of Radiguet's greatness, as well as the agelessness of great works.  After these almost inflammatory intrigues, Radiguet deftly manages to return the manage a trois &quot;to it's proper place, that is to say into obscurity.&quot;<br />I can't recommend this book to everyone, just as I believe that one's personal religious faith ought not be proselytized to the unready or unwilling.  You will have come to it on your own in order to gratefully partake in the delights contained herein.  There is a treasure trove of early 20th Century French writers (many of them nowadays obscure) of which Raymond Radiguet is but one sharply sparkling diamond, waiting to be discovered by anyone attracted to good literature and poetry.  Many, many American authors have been influenced by the French, and Wallace Fowlie's &quot;Guide&quot; is sort of a treasure map.<br />This little lavender Pushkin Press edition of &quot;Count d'Orgel&quot; is well done, having been printed on good, solid paper stock and containing a brief memoir by Radiguet's &quot;mentor&quot; Jean Cocteau.  On the opening page there is a Seurat painting of a ghostly cat against a dark background, setting the tone of intrigue for the novel.  The dust-jacket illustration contains an obscure &quot;mood&quot; painting by Duncan Ward which corresponds nicely to Radiguet's last words uttered to Cocteau:  &quot;There is a colour that moves and people are hidden in that colour.&quot;  Cocteau asks if he'd like these &quot;people&quot; sent away.  Radiguet responds, &quot;You cannot send them away as you cannot see the colour.&quot;<br />The masked costume &quot;ball&quot; of the title doesn't actually take place, but in the preparations for it at the d'Orgels the people hidden in that &quot;moving colour&quot; come to light, just as Seurat's whispy cat leaps onto the cover page.  It is here, amidst discarded costumes, and the sense of a widening gulf separating Francois from Mahuat, and Mahuat from Anne, as the tropical island Martinique is from Paris, where Radiguet's preciously innocent love triangle (and writing career) climaxes - just as it should - with a hushed whisper.y of them nowadays obscure) of which Raymond Radiguet is but one sharply sparkling diamond, waiting to be discovered by anyone attracted to good literature and poetry.

US	38794152	R2H0D7SD2KMXIC	046508138X	549201674	Basic Economics:  A Citizen's Guide to the Economy	Books	3	40	50	N	N	Capitalism 101	&quot;Economics is a study of the allocation of scarce resources which have alternative uses.&quot; - p.1 (and many others)<br />&quot;In a sense, it is unfair when some people are unable to earn as much as others with similar skills, diligence, and other virtues. Yet this unfairness to particular individuals is what makes the economy as a whole operate more efficiently for the benefit of vastly larger numbers of others.&quot; - p.20<br />&quot;Incentives matter because most people will do more for their own benefit than for the benefit of others.&quot; - p.46<br />&quot;Individual freedom, competition and prices add up to what is loosely called 'the market'&quot;. - p.308<br />Having taken no formal college courses in economics but wanting to brush up for graduate school (and my own edification) I purchased Thomas Sowell's &quot;Basic Economics&quot; and committed the foremost sin of all bookworms in judging a book by its cover, assuming from its title that it would solve all my needs.  Well, it did and didn't.  I want more economics!  I had started at the very beginning with who else but Adam Smith and his revolutionary &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot;.  I didn't get too far before I realized that something more up to date and brief would probably be more enticing.  Smith is historically vital, but his theories have been greatly improved upon over the past hundred years.  For the most part I found Sowell's overview of economics easy to follow.  He does an excellent job at breaking down supposedly &quot;complex&quot; economic concepts into the understandable nuts and bolts of a price-coordinated capitalist economy.  In doing so he misses few opportunities to explain to us why our system works, and why others (notably the former Soviet Union's) didn't.  There are many awkward moments when Sowell appears to be promoting a conservative, or perhaps a libertarian agenda, and this can be difficult for us &quot;unconverted economic neophytes&quot; to swallow, although in retrospect many of his arguments are obviously rooted in his unwavering enthusiasm for what sounds suspiciously like laissez faire economics.  I was interested to read his grudging concession of certain specific duties to the government (such as the EPA, and the military for example) which would never form of themselves if left solely to the laws of supply and demand.  In his chapter on &quot;External Costs &amp; Benefits&quot; he begins by admitting that, &quot;Economic decisions made through the marketplace are not always better than decisions that governments can make&quot;.  Bravo!<br />I learned a lot from this book despite its all too frequent errors of punctuation, and very poor editing by Basic Books &amp; Co.  There's an anecdote referring to the Soviet Union on pgs. 43-44 for example, which is repeated verbatim in a footnote on pg. 75, re-used so as to illustrate two different points - efficiency indeed!  This from the 2000 first edition (green cover), and so I imagine, and hope that the revised red cover edition corrects these sadly printed errors in punctuation and sentence structure.  Also, I learned from this book in spite of  Mr. Sowell himself.  I think he tends to get in the way of his own arguments a little too often, and his book would have benefited had he made an effort to include more representative arguments on controversial political issues like rent control, unemployment/job creation, protectionism/tariffs, worker exploitation, minimum wage laws, job security, the enivironment, socialism, and so on.  The weak representation of most of these important subjects makes it easy for Mr. Sowell to steam-roll with the invincible glory of his &quot;Basic Economics&quot;.  Most of the time he is convincing, but you'll need an open and diplomatic mindset to enjoy him.  Otherwise, you'll definitely find his treatment of many subjects irritatingly simplistic and incomplete.  Sowell himself points out in Chapter 22 on &quot;Non-Economic Values&quot; that, &quot;Economics is not a value in and of itself. It is only a way of weighing one value against another&quot; (p.305).  Whether or not he adheres to this sentiment throughout his book is debatable.<br />Nevertheless, &quot;Basic Economics: A Citizens Guide to the Economy&quot; should be more widely read, and ought to be rated here with four or five stars based on its instructive value alone.  Regardless of political beliefs, you'll learn about fundamental economic concepts such as costs, prices, surplusses/shortages, supply/demand, inflation/deflation, incremental trade-offs, incentives, and ultimately, you'll come away from &quot;Basic Economics&quot; having learned &quot;...the tools for evaluating policies and proposals in terms of [their] logical implications and empirical evidence.&quot;<br />In addition to this book, I've also purchased Charles Wheelan's, &quot;Naked Economics&quot; which professes to accomplish exactly what Mr. Sowell set out to do (basics with no graphs or charts), but supposedly does so in a more &quot;even-handed manner&quot; according to Amazon reviewers.  And for the &quot;other side&quot; there is always Marx's &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot; or &quot;Das Capital&quot;, and &quot;Socialist Thought - A Documentary History&quot; edited by Albert Fried &amp; Ronald Sanders.&quot;Economics is not a value in and of itself.

Originally written in 1976 (I have the 1979 third printing which I found for $1 used!), and apparently now on its fifth printing, &quot;Coffee: A Guide to Buying, Brewing and Enjoying&quot; has become quite popular.  Previous reviewers have commented on its being slightly out of date, and one even complained about the brown ink print on tan paper!  First off, with regards to modern equipment such as high quality grinders and coffee makers, and some information on where to buy coffee, David's guide may be in need of updating (I can't tell you what's in the newer editions).  However, none of the important information in the book will ever be obsolete, and in any event, you can satisfy all your modern coffee equipment needs right here on Amazon.com -how convenient!  Secondly, I have to say that the brown ink on off-white paper is ideally suited for the topic and quite pleasing to the eye.  Since the 1970's gourmet coffee has swept the USA, and every shopping mall, city, and town has at least two or three gourmet coffee shops nearby (often within the same block), and so finding good quality coffee shouldn't be a problem at all.  For mail order or retail outlets, I highly recommend Peets Coffee - [...] - which in my opinion is by far the best gourmet coffee available on the market.<br />Coffee culture is timeless and I think you'll be pleased with the quality of information contained in this book.  Each chapter is a &quot;how to&quot; guide on such subjects as the history, purchasing, tasting, roasting, grinding, brewing, serving, and growing of coffee.  There is also a section about caffeine, and if you're looking for more in-depth reading about coffee as a &quot;drug&quot;, than I suggest finding a copy of Dale Pendell's incredible poetical discourse on &quot;Stimulating Plants, Potions &amp; Herbcraft&quot; entitled, &quot;Pharmako/Dynamis&quot; (Mercury House, 2002).  For general reference, or historical curiosity, &quot;Coffee&quot; is both delightful and useful to have laying out on your coffee table, its soon to be tattered and stained pages faithfully awaiting your next coffee ceremony.(Mercury House, 2002).

Not Tiger (his swing is too violent), nor the Bear (Jack gets too crouched up and tight), nor the Shark, nor El Nino, nor the Mechanic, nor Phil or VJ, nor . . . the rest of the field.  All except Ernie - the Big Easy -  who makes golf look and feel natural.  In this easy to read, short and straight-forward instruction book Ernie begins with the essentials of having a good grasp of &quot;G.A.S.P.&quot; (Grip, Aim, Stance, and Position).  It all starts with the grip, and in life-size pictures on pgs. 16-20 he demonstrates the most essential of essentials in golf, applicable to every golfer regardless of experience level.  Ernie moves on to the book's focus: the swing.  Discussing &quot;chain theory&quot;, rhythym &amp; tempo, posture, ball position, stance, and &quot;the magic move&quot; Els provides plenty of helpful hints and instructions on how to make your swing become his swing, and therefore, his success in golf become your success.  And why would you want to do this?  Because Ernie's a winner who understands that the &quot;means&quot; in golf as in life are just as, if not more important, than the &quot;ends&quot;.  Sound too philosophical?  Play golf and draw your own conclusions, but by all means, no matter where you are, it's never too late to study and perfect the fundamentals.  And, contrary to some previous reviewer's reservations (short people take heart, he mentions the Wee Welshman, Ian Woosnam and lanky Davis Love III as examples!), one does not need to have Ernie's build or physique to build a classic golf swing.  What one needs to do is unlearn bad habits, and to start over with a fresh attitude and professional help - who better than the Big Easy!<br />FYI: There is no instruction here on putting, chipping, or greenside bunker play.  For this, Ernie has another book titled: &quot;The Complete Short Game&quot; which may be useful.may be useful.	2004-06-24

The version I have is a 1960 paperback printed by Meridian Books (first printing, 1957), and it has a wall of French graffiti on the cover.  However you choose to find this handy companion, I highly recommend it for readers interested in insightful literary commentary, as well as for those seeking new, &quot;old&quot; (20th Century) French writers to read for the first time.  Fowlie's introduction discusses &quot;the French literary mind&quot;, and in Part I he discusses Valery, Gide, and Claudel in depth.  Part II concentrates on &quot;the Fate of the novel&quot;, &quot;Mauriac&quot;, and &quot;Literature &amp; Catholicism&quot;.  And Part III, the final section, contains chapters on theatre, cinema, poetry, and the essay.  There are pictures of a few of the writers, as well as bibliographies and biographies in the appendix.  This guide is also excellent for readers already familiar with many French writers but who are interested in further commentary, as well as seeing how they interrelate with the whole of French (and world) literature.<br />Fowlie discusses the works of writers as diverse as Gide, Mauriac, Camus, Claudel, Radiguet, Cocteau, Valery, Sartre, placing them in their historical context along with their contemporary American &amp; European influences.  If you're looking to learn more about French literature without overbearing historical detail, and are interested in the possibility of rediscovering authors you've possibly not heard of or been exposed to before, then Fowlie's book will be an enjoyable, and invaluable guide which you'll want to refer to over and over again.<br />These authors &amp; their works will change your life!	2004-06-14

You may come across Harry Crosby in biographies of D.H. Lawerence, Hart Crane, or James Joyce, and definitely in his wife, Caresse Crosby's &quot;The Passionate Years&quot;.  All in all, Geoffrey Wolff's biography is a welcome find. I came across an old and forgotten copy of &quot;Black Sun&quot; for $1 amidst thousands of used books at a San Francisco library sale in the &quot;pre-Amazon.com&quot; days when I was blindly searching for more information about Crosby who fascinated me. It was pure luck; or destiny! I had recently read his diary, &quot;Shadows of the Sun&quot; (Black Sparrow Press, 1977) which is the work he is most known for, and is one of the most fascinating &amp; captivating diaries I've ever read. Some reviewers have commented on the &quot;mediocre quality&quot; of Crosby's poems, but read within the context of &quot;Shadows of the Sun&quot; and/or &quot;Black Sun&quot; they melt into perfect harmony with his life. &quot;Black Sun&quot; is the ideal supplement to &quot;Shadows of the Sun&quot;, adding unbiased biographical details about Harry, the 1920's, and the wonderful influence Harry and Caresse had upon those they befriended. Wolff did an excellent job researching old letters from various archives, as well as utilizing his orignal diaries as source material - Harry kept assiduous details of his life for posterity's sake.<br />I'm glad to see that &quot;Black Sun&quot; has been reprinted in this new 2003 paperback, and it contains an afterword by Wolff discussing how and why he chose to write about Crosby. He states that he wouldn't have written about Crosby had he not committed suicide.  This is interesting, but not shocking, as that is what pulls everyone into Crosby's story in the first place - he seemed to be on top of the world right up until his tragic end. Yet, none of it was surprising to anyone who knew him. He and his recent mistress, Josephine shot themselves in a suicide pact. The mystery is in the details of how it all exactly transpired, and my personal opinion is that they were drunk, he talked about suicide, she took him seriously, stomped on his wedding ring, took his gun and shot herself first, beating him to the punch, and so leaving him with no escape (he had originally intended to die with Caresse at a predetermined date in the 1940's). The standard theory is that &quot;he shot her&quot; first (she, probably willingly, but unknown), and then, a couple hours later, himself. Indeed, he had discussed death frequently, and it was his own gun that he brought into the New York hotel room that final night in December, 1929. Whatever the actuality of the two suicides, the most fascinating thing about Harry to me (and perhaps to Wolff) is that his death and life were intertwined into a sparkling surrealist poem idealized, and carried out. Harry Crosby was and is a very rare figure in American literature, and gladly, due in great part to Geoffrey Wolff, will continue to remain so. One may take what they will from his brief life, but more than simply some lost peripheral figure from the &quot;bohemian 1920's&quot;, Harry was religously devoted to love, truth, poesy, and art. He committed himself to living out his aethetic ideals to the fullest extent possible, making his and Caresse's life together an inspiring firestorm of intense passion.<br />Carpe Diem.in the first place - he seemed to be on top of the world right up until his tragic end.

US	38794152	R3HOAPQWJHOPKU	067964301X	162140487	2: I Promise to Be Good: The Letters of Arthur Rimbaud (Modern Library)	Books	5	15	15	N	Y	Above All . . .	Rimbaud liked to use the phrase, &quot;above all&quot; in many of his early letters, which according to Wyatt Mason is indicative of his imperious personality. As one reads on, Rimbaud's demands serve a desperate purpose: he wants to improve himself through literature, and get out of town.  He demands freedom.<br />There are some 250 letters collected here, some for the first time in English. Of these, only 30 were written during the time when he was writing poetry. This is all that has been found and collected. Additionally, a few photographs Rimbaud took while in Abyssinia are printed, along with others of Africa, including the slick cover photograph of what appears to be Rimbaud and his co-workers in Aden - never before printed as far as I know. Mason's introduction goes a long way to get to the heart of the real vs. the mythical Rimbaud, and he takes to task previous biographers for simultaneously debunking and promoting the Rimbaud myth. He goes on to compare Rimbaud's letters with those of Van Gogh (I would also include Gauguin, for they all lived &amp; wrote in the same years). The main difference of course being that Van Gogh wrote extensively and confessionally about art and life, while Rimbaud only briefly outlined his thoughts on poetry in the so-called &quot;seer letters&quot;. Comparing the relative &quot;salaciousness&quot; and quality of the artist's letters, Mason writes: &quot;There is little of that register in Rimbaud's correspondence. Rather, a sober impatience running from first letter to last. And it is the uniqueness of this tone - a relentless striving - that so informs our understanding of Rimbaud, both as poet and trader.&quot;<br />For those readers unacquainted with Rimbaud and hoping for first-hand accounts of his Parisian adventures, his European travels, debauched meetings with other poets and artists, and poetical inspirations they will likely be disappointed in the long run. Those who are familiar with Rimbaud know that once he left for Africa, he stopped writing poetry. He had gained nothing positive from it, and the Verlaine affair probably pushed him over the edge once and for all.

One of Hesse's most popular and accessible works, Siddhartha is his &quot;Indic Poem&quot; based on the life of a young Brahmin from an Indian village who leaves home to seek fulfillment. The novel is short, and in tone, more akin to Hesse's fairy-tales and &quot;legends&quot; (see, &quot;The Fairy Tales of Hermann Hesse&quot;, Jack Zipes, 1995). As such, Siddhartha flows simply and magically, like an epic poem or sonata (for music, find Claude Viver's &quot;Siddartha&quot;.)<br />When I first read this book I was younger, and focused on the departure from home aspect of the novel. The cold break from his father was disturbing and uncomfortable, yet necessary.  But necessary for what? Every youth leaves home, but not all knowing (or caring) why.  When I came back to this book recently, many years afterwards, I read it on a nearby mountain-top beside a stream in a sunny little grove, and found it incredibly fluid; almost perfect in structure and theme. Hesse's message is that one's own personal journey is more important than simply following another's learned doctrines, no matter how much you agree with them. Siddhartha comes to this conclusion after years and years of wandering in the forrests as an ascetic Samana (&quot;Too much knowledge had hindered him...&quot;) and he understands that while knowledge and information may be taught and learned, wisdom must be gained through self-exploration. Of course it's useful and important to read, and learn from others, but unlike his friend Govinda, Siddhartha breaks from the Buddha's teachings not because he disagrees with him, but because he &quot;understands him&quot; (in fact, he is him - or, another &quot;him&quot;).<br />His journey includes a life of the senses &quot;amongst the people&quot; with the lovely courtesan Kamala, and a business career with the merchant Kamaswami.  Siddhartha (aka: the Buddha), must lose himself before finding himself again.  Eventually, he finds himself by the river which he had crossed in the first part of the novel, and which is the central, binding motif of the story. Here, with the old ferryman Vasudeva, and after a last, tragic encounter with Kamala (and a son he never knew he had) he eventually learns to synthesize intellect with sense (parts I &amp; II of the novel), and not to despise the cyclic world of illusions (i.e. Maya &amp; Samsara), but rather to embrace it, and to accept it - and love it. The novel ends with the gesture of a kiss, and a beatific smile.which he had crossed in the first part of the novel, and which is the central, binding motif of the story.

Perhaps it's because it's no longer in print? I don't know, but I highly recommend Ziolkowski's superbly readable critical study for ALL serious Hesse fans.  If you've read at least two of his novels, and plan on reading more, than you MUST at least glance through a couple chapters of this book.<br />In it, Ziolkowski discusses Hesse's life and times, putting his work into its literary context.  First and foremost, Hesse was a writer of fiction, and the craftmanship of Hesse's writing style is prevelant.  In addition to relevant biographical information, there are discussions on &quot;Magical Thinking&quot;, &quot;Timelessness&quot;, &quot;Humor&quot;, and &quot;Triadic Rhythm&quot;, which are all important aspects of structure and theme to be found in all of Hesse's work.  The focus here is on the six major novels, in chronological order: Demian, Siddhartha, Steppenwolf, Narcissus &amp; Goldmund, Journey to the East, and The Glass Bead Game.  Each is given its own chapter and lengthy analysis.  One of the important discoveries Ziolkowski makes is that the spiritual progress of the protagonist in each novel continues where he left off in the successive novel (i.e. Demian develops into Siddhartha into the Steppenwolf into both Narcissus &amp; Goldmund, into the realm of Castalia in The Glass Bead Game).  This is a simplification, but the concept is fascinating once you've read all the novels, and can appreciate what Ziolkowski reveals about Hesse, a master artist.<br />There's a lot here, especially for a cheap, out-of-print paperback with a trippy 1960's black &amp; yellow cover full of Hesse heads!  Well worth having delivered to your doorstep, along with more of Hesse's magical works.  Happy journeys (to the East)!	2004-06-04

For years now, I've discovered many exciting variations of poetry through the writings of the more widely known French poets such as Lamartine, Hugo, Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Verlaine, Laforgue, Cendrars, and Apollinaire.  In this collection of some 56 poets writing between 1820 and 1950, William Rees brings together many other influential and somewhat less widely known poets such as Corbiere, Nouveau, Jammes, Heredia, and Supervielle, together into a developmental chronology of modern poetry.  This anthology is perfect for readers unfamiliar with the variety of French poets writing in this 130 year period, and who are open to new possibilities.  There are brief biograhpical essays on each poet represented, as well as on the &quot;movements&quot; they are associated with, if at all.  The introduction simply describes Rees's pragmatic intentions in translating often untranslatable verse into prose, and also includes a brief historical explanation of the alexandrine.<br />I've found the anthology to be quite useful when read from beginning to end without dwelling on each poem or poet.  In this manner, a reader will gain a general sense of poetry's parallel development with each passing decade or era.  Another reason I like this anthology is that it allows one a taste of the bountiful personalities and styles of poetry being read and re-read all the time, and thus, integrated into contemporary poetry whether it be English, American, or African - wherever there are good students.  On the whole, and intended or not, it is an instructive and insightful compendium displaying the purpose and essentiality of poetry to civilization.  Despite the inherent problems with translating foreign poetry into another language, the content of the poems shine through in their English prose translations; and anyone with a smidgen of French can compare the author's originals to their translations.  An exciting time-period in which one writer after another affects the next, and in many places, influence one another side-by-side.  Read it straight through, or thumb through it like a phone-book to dial into a brand new personality and take on life.  Any which way you decide, there are broadly influential contacts here anxiously awaiting fresh readers with whom to converse, debate, or share timeless thoughts and ideas with.ne with a smidgen of French can compare the author's originals to their translations.

WWII has passed, and in one way or another everyone from &quot;Cannery Row&quot; has either fought in it or been affected by it; now, they have resumed their lives in Monterey.  Some old characters have left, moved on, or died, and new characters such as Joseph &amp; Mary Rivas (one man), Flora, Whitey #2, and Suzy are new.  But the main characters without whom the book wouldn't have been written, Doc, Mack, and Hazel return.  Each character is real and believable from speech to dress, thought and action.  Their seemingly mundane and simple lives are interesting and appealing (as are most people's without even realizing it), and the love story which develops between Doc and Suzy is charming in my opinion.  Throughout, and especially in the two chapters Steinbeck entitles &quot;hooptedoodle&quot;, there are interesting asides on subjects such as Pacific Grove, Carmel Valley, and marine biology for example, which help fill in the larger universe of &quot;Sweet Thursday/Cannery Row&quot;.  One of my favorite chapters is the one entitled: &quot;There's a Hole in Reality Through Which We Can Look if We Wish&quot;.  Here, Doc takes a lonely, evening stroll along the beach where he encounters a man called &quot;the Seer&quot;.  The Seer invites Doc to his campfire for dinner and in a mystical conversation we begin to really see and feel another side of Doc's personality not as evident in the more light-hearted &quot;Cannery Row&quot;.  This mysterious beach-bum talks to a morose Doc and gets him to realize that what's lacking in his life is nothing less than Love.  &quot;Sweet Thursday&quot; is the story of Doc's accepting love, as well as the good intentions of his diverse friends, into his life.  Steinbeck's further development of the other Cannery characters, along with his wonderful descriptions of Monterey County and the post-war time period is a perfect blend of art and story-telling talent which make for a highly enjoyable novel.

US	38794152	R1L8ICG3EUL3IP	0060803177	840557570	Eyeless in Gaza	Books	5	36	40	N	N	A Life of Meaning over Nonsense	Fascinating novel.  Although I've only read two other Aldous Huxley novels to date (\\"Brave New World\\" with \\"Revisted\\", & \\"Island\\"), I have to say that \\"Eyeless in Gaza\\" has piqued my burgeoning interest in Huxley's other works.  In many ways, it's a strange and difficult novel.  It is composed of 54 disordered chapters dealing with various aspects of Anthony Beavis' life between his youth in the early 1900's through his mid-forties in the 1930's.  The novel begins in medias res, and each chapter is a potential entry point providing glimpses of Anthony's life at crucial moments in the present, past, and future (depending on where you start).  Time is tweaked here in much the same way as in Faulkner's, \\"The Sound and the Fury\\" where the storyline is divided amongst four people's parallel lives.  Huxley's boundless structure allows Anthony Beavis' life to rise and fall on the waves of a mystical ocean of time with its contrapuntal rhythms.<br />One drawback to \\"Eyeless\\", and perhaps Huxley in general, is that his writing style is somewhat dry and cerebral.  His characters, like D.H. Lawrence's (a friend of his), often come across as representations of ideals, or \\"symbols\\" rather than full-fledged, multi-dimensional characters, and the exterior scenery sometimes suffers.  One notable exception is Helen Amberley, who is one of the more complex, and interesting characters in the novel.  As for the scenery, the most vivid scenes are not the physical atmosphere, but each character's experience of an event.  Examples include both Anthony and John Beavis' individual responses to Mrs. Amberley's death; Anthony and Brian playing with a toy boat on the school dormitory rooftop; or Helen flicking away a butterfly at Anthony's villa.  Huxley's descriptive style and focus is simply more erudite than it is sentimental or emotional.  Admittedly, there's a fine balance in such a highly condensed intellectual novel as this, and for the most part, I think Huxley manages to pull it off without being didactic or cold (readers who don't make it past the first 3-5 chapters probably won't go for it though).<br />Details aside, once you grow accustomed to Huxley's style and structure, Anthony Beavis' story is rewarding.  After the death of his mother in 1902, his life is shattered.  He avoids World War I due to a training accident/injury, and feels lucky.  The central aspect of the novel is Anthony's increasing diffidence towards life.  His meeting with Mary Amberley in 1912 (ala Mrs. Robinson/\\"The Graduate\\") really throws a monkey wrench into his life, and adds fuel to the general lovelessness and cynicism displayed in the summer 1933 chapters.  It is she who convinces Anthony to tragically betray his best friend, Brian Foxe in 1914.  Eventually, in the fall of 1933, his Marxist leaning friend Mark Staithes convinces him to \\"break free\\" of his negativity and attend a revolution with him in Mexico.  There, Anthony has a chance encounter with an eccentric traveller named Miller, whose Buddhist centered philosophy changes Anthony forever.  It is from all the 1934+ \\"meditation\\" chapters in which we see Anthony's sea-change from a life of indifference to one of meaning and purpose.  Huxley's method in displaying this \\"progression\\" from modern dissatisfaction and pessimism, into selfless positivity and pacifism is the whole of \\"Eyeless in Gaza\\"; and nothing short of amazing in my opinion.<br />With subtle undertones of World War One echoing in the backdrop, the impending hostility of World War Two thumps from the future.  Caught in between these institutionalized and mechanical worlds, are ordinary men and women like Anthony and Helen navigating the treacherous waterways of idealogy, politics, peer pressure/society, and conscience as best they \\"know how\\" (i.e. are trained to do).  In some ways, this novel is a lead-in to \\"Island\\" in which Huxley attempts to depict an ideal society populated by such self-actualized citizens as Miller, Purchas, and Anthony Beavis.  On the whole, \\"Eyeless in Gaza\\" can be demanding (it should be read at least twice - once by chapter, and once by date), and because Huxley doesn't spend a lot of time describing place or character, it can be easy to loose sense of the action the first time through.  However, once you begin to appreciate Huxley's intentions, \\"Eyeless\\" blossoms into a unique and powerful literary mosaic that you will find it hard to forget.thony Beavis.

Thankfully, I'd read enough of his short stories and essays to know that Aaron's Rod isn't indicative of his artistic capabilities.  I was more impressed by the concept behind the novel than its execution.  Essentially, Aaron Sisson's abandonment of his family and job in order to join a travelling orchestra is meant to symbolize the power and passion of &quot;individual freedom,&quot; &quot;personal friendship&quot;, &quot;masculinity&quot; and &quot;art&quot;.  I think he only half-succeeds.  Just as Aaron comes across as an &quot;incomplete&quot; man searching for meaning in post World War I Europe, I think the novel is too loosely constructed, and Lawrence's characters, too thinly drawn.  But on a symbolic level, they are full of Lawrentian psychology.  The characters of Rawden Lilly, Struthers, the Bricknells, and others all overtly represent various aspects of male and female polarities; however, they are un-memorable and sometimes difficult to relate to.<br />I was hoping this would be more of an &quot;artist's novel&quot; containing interesting descriptions of Aaron's life in Florence with his bohemian friends, and to a certain extent it is, but Lawrence seemed more interested in symbolism than in telling a good story.  Though scattered as a story, the concepts of individuality and society are clearly portrayed throughout &quot;Aaron's Rod&quot;, and towards the end, when the anarchist's bomb goes off, we sense a &quot;breaking&quot; (the blue ball/ornament at the beginning, and the flute/rod at the end) of an outdated mode of thinking (i.e. patriarchy, male dominance, etc.) in favor not necessarily of feminity, but an integration of the two.  This particular Penguin edition has an excellent introduction and helpful end-notes by Steven Vine which help explain Lawrence and his symbolism to those unfamiliar with his works.  I might re-read this novel once I've read more of Lawrence, and come back to it one day from a different viewpoint, but for now, I'd have to say that unless you're a real Lawrence afficionado, I'd hold off on this one until you figure out whether or not you like Lawrence enough to proceed to something as scattered, cold, and dry as this novel comes across.it one day from a different viewpoint, but for now, I'd have to say that unless you're a real Lawrence afficionado, I'd hold off on this one until you figure out whether or not you like Lawrence enough to proceed to something as scattered, cold, and dry as this novel comes across.	2004-05-28

He is one of my favorite English authors, mostly because of the skill with which he so easily marries place, time, and scenery into the drama at hand.  The motivations and actions of his characters are generally believable and in tune with their characterization.  Christmas Holiday is no exception, although in my book it's far behind his three best novels, \\"Of Human Bondage\\", \\"The Razor's Edge\\", and \\"The Moon and Sixpence\\".  I like the story, but after two readings continue to find it less memorable than the novels just mentioned, or many of his South Pacific short stories.<br />Charley Mason, a middle class college student from England is given a holiday in Paris by his Babbit-esque father during Christmas-time.  He gladly accepts, and there, looks up his philosophically engrossed friend, Simon.  Simon has been living a spartan lifestyle, filling his head with fascist political idealogy.  No matter how friendly Charley tries to be, Simon pushes him away in a misguided attempt to make himself \\"hard\\" and impervious.  The interactions between Simon and Charley remind me of those between Anthony Beavis, Helen Amberley, and Mark Staithes in Aldous Huxley's, \\"Eyeless in Gaza\\".  Both novels, which were written in the late 1930's, portray the tense build-up to WWII, and the brewing hostility of zealous fascists.  Maugham certainly came across people seduced by fascist ideaology at this time, and Simon is the fictional incarnation of these uncompromising dogmatists.<br />The bulk of the story evolves around Charley's lengthy discussions with a young Russian prostitute named Lydia, introduced to him by Simon.  Lydia is really the main focus of the novel, and it's her wild, and dramatic life-story which captivates and eventually opens Charley's naive and sleepy eyes to the complexities of the world, and especially women.  Instead of using her for pleasure, as Simon had intended, Charley be-friends her (in accord with his gentlemanly nature) and spends his vacation time getting to know her.  The best parts about the novel to me are Maugham's descriptions of the Parisian background.  Unlike Huxley, Maugham has a play-write's acute sensibility to atmosphere, and is very comfortable describing and utilizing scenery:  Charley's comfortable English home, Simon's spartan studio, Charley's pleasant hotel room, the streets of Montparnasse, the smoky cafes, bars, and restaurants, the Louvre, St. Eustache, French Guyanna, etc. are all vividly drawn.  Each significant conversation between the characters takes place in a location which enhances and compliments the larger story.  At the Louvre when Lydia shows Charley her favorite painting, a simple picture of bread and wine by Chardin, and tells him what it means to her, Charley, who had been reminiscing and searching for all the \\"significant\\" paintings his art-snob mother had so eloquently spoken to him of, is visably affected.<br />The contrast between Charley and all that he represents, with Lydia and her tragic world, is the heart of the novel.  The main drawbacks to me are Robert Berger's (Lydia's imprisoned husband)overly-consuming story, and the seemingly sleight handling of Charley throughout.  The Robert Berger mystery is interesting in itself, but sometimes didn't jibe well with the \\"Charley Mason explores and comes of age in Paris\\" storyline.  And Maugham sometimes seems ambiguous about likable characters like Charley (or, Larry in \\"The Razor's Edge\\").  I think this reflects Maugham's increasing bitterness in old age, ala Lord Henry Wotton (\\"Dorian Gray\\").  As always with Maugham, there has to be drama, and I think Maugham's self-described status as \\"the best of the second-raters\\" is never more apropos than in Christmas Holiday.friends her (in accord with his gentlemanly nature) and spends his vacation time getting to know her.

Crane is huge.  He is also an acquired taste, and can be quite demanding to decipher.  I've found myself having to re-read his poems multiple times, from different perspectives before grasping their sense.  And even then, the &quot;meaning&quot; can be illusive.  But this complete collection of his work by Marc Simon includes an insightful introduction by John Unterecker which helps put Crane's life and work into perspective.  The singular fault with this book is that Simon's end-notes don't offer any insight into the poems themselves, and so the reader is left to fend for himself.  On the one hand this is good in that it encourages self-reflection, and arriving at one's own interpretations.  Many of his poems can and should be taken at face value.  On the other hand, with Crane, sometimes there is more than meets the eye (i.e. In &quot;Chaplinesque&quot; one should know the Chaplin film, &quot;The Kid&quot; to fully understand the kitten image, and there are many allusions in &quot;The Bridge&quot; and other poems which a reader ought to familiarize himself with at some point) and so, having some literary criticism or background available is very helpful.  I highly recommend Warner Berthoff's, &quot;Hart Crane: A Re-Introduction&quot; (University of Minnesota, 1989).<br />Reading Hart Crane is rewarding, and enjoyable.  It's a voyage in itself, full of twists and turns, sounds, objects, colors, senses, places, times, language, and history.  &quot;The Bridge&quot; is his acclaimed epic, about the Brooklyn Bridge and America, and a must read for those interested in American poetry.  Crane was definitely influenced by the revolutionary 19th century French poets Rimbaud and Laforgue, who like Crane, also led tragically short lives.  Their lives and works, along with Walt Whitman (of, course) created ample material for modern American poetry, and Hart Crane is their magnificent heir (especially of Jules Laforgue's lyricism and colloquialisms).  If you've never tried Crane before, than this is &quot;the&quot; collection to have.  Allow Crane to show you his visions of the world from the inside out, take you on journeys across the ocean, and into the modern city and you'll be amazed at how daily life no longer seems so mundane., along with Walt Whitman (of, course) created ample material for modern American poetry, and Hart Crane is their magnificent heir (especially of Jules Laforgue's lyricism and colloquialisms).

Having had no clue about John Nash, let alone much about the whole \\"mathematical community\\" I was very interested after seeing the movie.  I guess what captured my attention most was: 1.) the tragic nature of Nash's personal struggles with schizophrenia, 2.) his genius, and 3.) the fact that most people had never heard of him (or his influence) before.  Thus, the fact that Sylvia Nasar chose to write a biography about \\"some boring\\" mathematician (and mathematical society, namely Princeton's) was a bold, and much needed thing for the general public.  I've read a little about such geniuses as Albert Einstein, Bertrand Russell, and Alfred North Whitehead, but in general, anything to do with science or math just turns me cold.  So, even though the movie took sensational liberties, it did help to make math sexy, and attractive for the public again.  So, it was now or never for me, and I bought the biography hoping to learn more, not only about Nash, but about mathematics.<br />On the one hand, Nash's personal life was a lot more captivating than that which the movie portrayed.  While the movie simplified and dramatized certain events in his life to the nth degree, such as his \\"mysterious non-existent roommate\\", or his high-drama encounters with the \\"government agents\\", the chronology was off, and there are many real events from his life that the reader of this biography will find even more interesting and pertinent.  Unfortunately, the real Nash is not as sexy as the movie portrays, and he must have been a real jerk to be around at times (he was not only a cruel child, and indifferent friend, but a cruel husband as well, leaving his first wife to the dogs).  My main issue with Nasar's writing is that I didn't come away satisfied that his actual work was explained very thoroughly.  The wider influence, and importance of his work (as well as other mathematicians mentioned) was too vague (i.e. after reading the biography, I couldn't tell you in great detail why Nash was great, or what his work has done to change anyone's life).  Perhaps, like some of the single star reviewers out there, I'm being too harsh in my criticism of Nasar as a writer, but even though I think she portrayed his personality, and the nature of schizophrenia extremely well, she didn't seem to understand the mathematical side of things as well as she probably should have to make this a \\"classic\\" biography.<br />Nevertheless, the lack of mathematics and game theory detail is probably a good thing in that it's lead me to seek out more serious overviews on mathematics, including one called:  \\"The Essential John Nash\\", edited by Ms. Nasar and Harold Kuhn, 2002.  This concise summation of his work is accessible to non-math types, and highly recommended for those more interested in Nash's work than his personal life.

Jules Laforgue was a contemporary of Rimbaud, yet they never knew one another because just as Rimbaud had stopped writing poetry and was leaving for Abyssinia, Laforgue was arriving in Paris from South America (where he was born).  There is some debate over who really wrote the first &quot;free verse&quot;, as Rimbaud had already written his &quot;Illuminations&quot;, however Laforgue was the first to actually have his vers libres published.  And so, his influence on modern English poetry through Eliot, and Crane was established.<br />Where Rimbaud is &quot;harsh&quot;, and &quot;brusque&quot;, Laforgue is subtle and melancholy.  The former is more the visionary, whereas Laforgue seems to me more the dreamer/imaginary.  Either-way, Laforgue is wonderful to read, and a nice change of pace from Rimbaud.  Even though he wrote more than Rimbaud, his life was shorter - he died of tuberculosis at 27!  The translations in this Penguin edition by Graham Dunstin Martin are literal, and so the poetic affect is limited unless you are able to read a little of the French (printed right above the translations in more prominent print).  For verse translations, I highly recommend William Jay Smith (&quot;Selected Readings of Jules Laforgue&quot;, 1956.)<br />I have yet to read all of Laforgue's works (there are the &quot;Moral Tales&quot;, and essays on &quot;Berlin&quot;, art, and landscapes), but my overall impression of his five books of poems presented here is of seemingly schizophrenic conversations with the moon, clowns, and inanimate objects like cigarettes, pianos, and buildings.  His imagery is incredible (&quot;skeletons of wisteria&quot;, &quot;stewpot, poor Earth!&quot;, &quot;heart of gold stuffed with literary spices&quot;, &quot;brain pickled in the alchohol of pride&quot;) and the French rhymes magnificently musical.  Laforgue is playful, melancholy, and pessimistic using an attractive poetic style.  Both Rimbaud and Laforgue are princes of modernity, following up on the Master, Baudelaire's dark revolution against and away from romanticsm.  Laforgue captures fleeting sensations and moments more playfully than Rimbaud, I think, using more colloquial language than his peer, but Rimbaud is second to none for obscure visions and acerbic wit.  All in all, Laforgue's poems will make you smile at times in their innocence and lunacy, but most importantly, they are a conversation with various muses (lunar, pierrot, the feminine, amor, etc.) which are inspiring, thought-provoking, and astonishing all at once.up on the Master, Baudelaire's dark revolution against and away from romanticsm.

Oscar Wilde's \\"Dorian Gray\\" is about youth, corruption, and esthetics.  Reflective of Wilde's own life and revolt against Victorian era sentimentality, young Dorian Gray slowly changes after his philosophical discussions with the cynical Lord Henry Wotton, whose cold criticisms and harsh wit are often humorous in an addictively jaded kind of way, and tempting to arm oneself with; however, read on and observe Wilde's destruction of Lord Henry's young protoget.  The immediate power of Basil Hallward's portrait of Dorian retains a demonic hold on its confused subject, taunting and torturing his vanity with its strangely metamorphizing characteristics.  Who's changing, and what exactly is changing?  Wilde creates an unforgettable \\"portrait\\" here of one man's (or is it the whole of Victorian society?) demise.  Many critics of Wilde have seen him and \\"The Portrait of Dorian Gray\\" as pure evil and criticized the undertones of homosexuality, and linked it with a lifestyle of debauchery and degradation.  Wilde was thrown in jail for his \\"unlawful activities\\".  To them I must concur with Wilde, that \\"Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming.

So, I decided to give it a second chance.  It's now thoroughly underlined, highlighted, and thumbed through.  I continue to use the reading list in the appendix as a lifetime must-read list.<br />This is one of those books that really should be required reading in college, and perhaps high-school (but I doubt most high school students would bother with it).  The fraction that I did originally read in college stayed with me all these years, and brought me back to the complete book.  I won't go into detail of how the book works (other reviewers have done that), but will say that if you follow Adler &amp; Van Doren's suggestions for active, passionate reading you'll find yourself enjoying books more than ever.  And, in my case, enjoying the act of reading for the first time in my life.  Since first reading &quot;How to Read a Book&quot; some years ago, I've rarely been without reading material that I was enthusiastic about, and continue to use the suggestions in this &quot;guide to intelligent reading&quot; at various times to remind myself of such things as the difference between reading for information vs. understanding; or when and how to read long novels quickly and with immersion and not get lost or bogged down without taking forever to finish, if at all.<br />This guide is filled with information and recommendations which most of us probably think we already know, but since the subject of reading itself isn't usually well taught, becomes a classic, and vital handbook for any serious reader.	2004-05-18

Hugo was never required reading in any of my high-school English classes, so finally, after recently visiting Paris and seeing Notre Dame for myself, I felt obliged to read Hugo's novel.  Over the course of a few weeks, and some wistfully long rainy days, I became enthralled with Hugo's seemingly eye-witness acccount of 15th century Paris.  The most developed character of all is of course, the cathedral, and Hugo devotes whole chapters to its history.  Another chapter on the invention of the printing press is fascinating not only for its historical value, but Hugo's comparisons to architecture, the middle-ages, and society.  The highly symbolic character of Esmeralda, who takes refuge in Notre Dame's walls, is the &quot;other&quot; protagonist of the novel, and the object of both the repressed Claude Frollo, and the grotesque, Quasimodo.  She falls tragically in love with Phoebus de Chateaupers, a typically arrogant and callous soldier who treats her like a prostitute (i.e. Mary Magdalene).  The characters of Jehan Frollo (Claude's brother), and the destitute poet Pierre Gringoire, are enjoyable to follow throughout the story, which weaves in and around the streets surrounding the dominating towers of Notre Dame (which all visitors are obliged to climb after reading this beautiful novel for just as beautiful views of Paris).<br />Without giving away the story or ending, I'll just say that despite having known about this story all these years, it held many surprises and interesting scenes for me.  Understanding that Hugo is a quintessential 19th Century Romantic, the reader will encounter two different worlds in one here, as Hugo creates a 19th Century gothic romance using exquisite research and detail from the late 15th Century.  His general commentaries on architecture and history are worth reading in themselves.  Without being overly dry or pedantic, Hugo manages to convey the importance of historical preservation (the popularity of this book was greatly responsible for refurbishing Notre Dame to its present well-being), as well as creating an enthralling, imaginative human story which is accessible to every reader throughout time.  Esmeralda &amp; Notre Dame (strangely, not Quasimodo, &quot;the Hunchback&quot;) remain the most memorable and haunting characters to me.  Overall, Notre Dame is an impressive accomplishment, especially for a story with an edifice as its central character!Without being overly dry or pedantic, Hugo manages to convey the importance of historical preservation (the popularity of this book was greatly responsible for refurbishing Notre Dame to its present well-being), as well as creating an enthralling, imaginative human story which is accessible to every reader throughout time.

This is said to be the most complete collection of Rimbaud's works ever collected in English and includes some of his early schoolwork, rough drafts, incomplete writings notes & ideas.  To a Rimbaudophile such as myself this is an incredible resource; and perhaps the last great addition to the study of Rimbaud and his poetry ever, unless, miracle of miracles, the lost manuscript of \\"La Chasse Spirituelle\\" were to be discovered in some dead French book collector's attic.  Alas!  Until then we must be satisfied (and grateful) with being able to read and compare early drafts of A Season in Hell, or some early texts translated into English for the first time.  In addition to this volume, Mason has also collected Rimbaud's correspondence in \\"I Promise to be Good\\" (2003).  This companion volume includes a previously unpublished photograph of Rimbaud in Abyssinia (on the cover & inside as well) and reads like an autobiography of sorts.<br /><br />I've put Wyatt Mason's translations of Rimbaud on my best books of all time list (\\"Heavy Hitters, Inspiration, & Enlightenment\\") because Rimbaud's poetry was revolutionary in its time and influential in our own.  Mason's  goal is to \\". . . find common, rather than middle, ground between the two poles represented by Fowlie and Schmidt,\\" (other translations worth comparing) and his focus is on how Rimbaud \\"might have written\\" were he writing in English.  I suppose it all comes down to what concepts of translation you prefer; for the most part I like Mason's style and the rhythm and structure of the originals seem to be there.  It is always interesting to see different authors, and especially poets, interpret original texts in a foreign language.  The fact is not everyone will be pleased with the results (cf. critical reviews on Amazon).  The solution?  Learn French and read the texts in the original.  Short of that, or in addition, read multiple translations (I recommend Oliver Bernard's prose translations in the Penguin paperback for a more direct approach) and come to your own conclusions.  Better yet, translate Rimb's poems on your own!  In the end, Rimbaud is difficult, if not impossible, to penetrate regardless of whether or not you understand French).  To read Rimbaud is one thing, but to see and feel him is quite another.

In the end, what the poems mean to you and how you choose to incorporate them into your life will be the most important factor in deciding whether or not you'll buy into the fruits of Wyatt Mason's own poetic endeavors, and ultimately, Rimbaud's.

This was the fourth biography on Rimbaud I'd read, and I found it the most accessible.  However, the very best biography for my money, warts and all (she perpetuates a couple false myths about R.), is the Enid Starkie biography from 1961.  Unlike Robb, she gives an analysis of many of his poems in the context of his life and times, while capably commenting on other personalities and poets of the era in which he lived.  Still, even Robb in this biography, despite insisting on dismantling the so-called Rimbaud myths, perpetuates the &quot;bad-boy genius&quot; image here and there.  If one reads his letters (see &quot;I Promise to Be Good&quot;, Wyatt Mason, 2003) they will see that &quot;...it is not generally appreciated how methodical a student of poetry Rimbaud was . . . Rimbaud made himself a poet by a long, involved, and sober study of the history of poetry.&quot;<br />But this is a review of Robb's book, and I do recommend it because it's the most up-to-date version of Rimbaud (as of 2003) and probably includes the most accurate chronology of all bios to date, as well as more details of his time with Verlaine, and in Africa (for which, Charles Nicholl's book, &quot;Somebody Else: Rimbaud in Africa&quot;, 1997 is the best).<br />Overall,  I think Robb's biography is the best modern introduction to Rimbaud (besides his poems, of course) for someone unfamiliar with him at all.  His writing syle is less pedantic, and more journalistically captivating than Starkie, and others (I suppose it's a matter of taste, background, and direction, but it's probably impossible to find any dull biographies about Rimbaud anyway).  Rimbaud continues to seduce and attract modern poets, wanderers, and seekers alike, and this biography is one more key to the fullest portrait possible of Rimbaud we'll ever get.<br />&quot;Or, tout dernierement m'etant sur le point de faire le dernier couac! j'ai songe a rechercher la clef du festin ancien, ou je reprendrais peut-etre appetit.&quot;<br />But just lately, finding myself on the point of uttering the last croak, I thought of looking for the key to the old feast, where perhaps I might find my appetite again.ot;<br />But just lately, finding myself on the point of uttering the last croak, I thought of looking for the key to the old feast, where perhaps I might find my appetite again.	2004-05-12

I should probably give it 3.5 stars, but since it's Balzac, I'll say 4.  I actually found the story captivating enough to pull me all the way through (the 2nd attempt...).  There are dry, and lenghty parts (only three chapter breaks), but it's a unique novel.  The Chouans takes place during the Napoleonic, post Revolutionary period when there are continuing civil battles between the new Rupublicans and the ancien regime, Royalists (which include the northen province Chouans).  There is a lot of historical value to this novel in how Balzac displays the sentiments of the two sides, and various military personalities' views on the direction of government, and France in particular.  As with most history, some modern parallels may even be drawn (i.e. conservative vs. liberal views on how a country should be run; conscription, and occupied peoples).<br />I really liked how Balzac took this piece of French history, actually visited and lived in the locals used as background, and created an interesting (albeit a dated 19th century romance)story out of it all.  It's all a matter of taste I suppose, but if you really want to get into Balzac (a worthy endeavor for any serious student of the novel, literature, and the history of the 19th century) than the Chouans is as good a starting point as any.  It would've been interesting to see what other Scenes de la militaire Balzac might have come up with had he lived long enough.<br />All in all, there are great (and mediocre) character portraits, and I think Mlle. Verneuil is well done, actually.  It's fun (in a colorfully &quot;romantic&quot; kind of way), mysterious, historical, and . . . well, it's BALZAC.	2004-05-12

Crescent is very much akin to sitting down day after day in a local Middle-Eastern cafe and eavesdropping on a different culture and world.  Through Sirine, a cook at Um Nadia's cafe in her late 30's, we smell, taste, and experience her daily life in Los Angeles.  Sirine isn't all that in touch with her Iraqi heritage, but throughout the novel she develops a love interest with a university graduate student named Han who tells her all about modern day Iraq.  Other characters in Sirine's life, especially her lovable Uncle who creates a fantastic fairy-tale straight out of Arabian Nights which mysteriously echo's Sirine's life, contribute to her burgeoning interest in her heritage.  All the while, she cooks up wonderfully aromatic, delicious food that brings everyone together.  There is a unique level of passionate discussion and debate about poetry, politics, and daily life among these people which creates an intimate atmosphere and sense of pride in their cultural heritage.  One of Abu-Jaber's characters at one point mentions Mafouz, an Egyptian writer, and so I was encouraged to find a copy of his \\"Cairo Triology\\", which I plan on reading.  Sirine's search for love and identity amidst the backdrop of modern day Los Angeles is at times difficult, sad and lonely, but often humerous and always passionate.  Surely, while reading Crescent you will find yourself sipping hot coffee and dining at your favorite local Middle-Eastern cafe, and rooting for Sirine to find fulfillment in the end.	2004-04-06

The fact that there are currently some 445 other Amazon reviews out there (almost all ravingly positive) attests to the universal power of this novel.  So, I'll just submit my humble little offering to this Grapes of Wrath shrine with 5 stars, and a caveat:<br />The Grapes of Wrath is long-winded, and slightly &quot;boring&quot;.  However, that said, don't be put off, it's actually hard to put down and reads relatively quickly.  The style of writing matches the content perfectly, and if you read it at long stretches you'll find yourself rhythmically attached to the story.  The long, drawn out narrative is meant to coincide very neatly with the long, depressing hardships the Joads face on their journey to California.  What happens to them along the way, and how Steinbeck chronicles different aspects of 1930's America in alternating chapters is what makes Steinbeck an artist here.  I don't think Steinbeck had quite reached the artistic capacity to create as vividly unique characters as he later does in Cannery Row &amp; Sweet Thursday, but again, The Grapes of Wrath is larger than specific characters, and Tom Joad isn't simply some displaced Oakie, but rather, he is a &quot;spirit&quot; that thankfully, refuses to die.  This novel is as much history as it is a good story.<br />At times you will feel indignant over how our country treated these people, and over the thoughtlessness of it's economic policies during the depression era.  And you will probably find just as ugly parallels today in the arenas of civil rights, education, social welfare, tax reform, and so on.  Thus, Steinbeck has created for posterity an American &quot;ghost&quot; which continues to haunt us.  An American classic, on the &quot;dark side&quot;.<br />If you're so inclined, Steinbeck kept a journal during the writing of this novel, titled, &quot;Working Days&quot; which I highly recommend for further insight into this masterpiece.masterpiece.	2004-03-19

This is a very helpful, and enlightening manual on the art of yoga - more specifically, &quot;Raja Yoga&quot; which is a balanced and comprehensive approach to yoga practice.  Knowing very little about yoga, but wanting to blend meditation with physical exercise on my own at home, I found an old record called &quot;Yoga for Self Awareness&quot; by Sri Kriyananda.  It's a four sided set that includes a full hour and a half of yoga postures, meditation, and chants.  It was pretty easy to follow along at first, but I realized that I desired to learn more and wanted to be sure I was doing the postures correctly.  I was pleasantly surprised to find &quot;Raja Yoga&quot; by Kriyananda (aka Donald Walters) on Amazon, and ordered it right away.<br /><br />The manual is divided into 14 chapters, each chapter into 7 subsets:  Philosophy, Postures, Breathing, Routine, Healing, Diet, and Meditation - all treated with equal gravity, although meditation does figure prominantly throughout Raja Yoga.  Yoga is rooted in religion, and so if meditation and religious sentiment don't appeal to you, you might just want to go find a local &quot;hatha&quot; yoga class at the YMCA, or gym.  However, I will say that if you open yourself up to the basic philosophy presented here, and surrender skepticism towards Kriyananda's medical advice (which seems rather incredulous at times) you'll find yourself believing instead of doubting.  The world is full of mystery (travel and see for yourself!), and to perpetually wrap oneself up in self-protective doubt is unproductive, and ultimately, harmful to spiritual (and physical) growth.  Skepticism, okay; but yoga teaches one to trust, and open oneself up to incredible possibilities, and I think this lesson in itself makes Raja Yoga invaluable.  I too didn't think I'd be able to do half of these postures when I first listened to the record (the cd that comes with the book is its one mediocre flaw, as it only contains an abbreviated version of the Yoga Postures record I found, along with a lecture by Kriyananda that you may or may not find inspiring. You don't need an audio supplement to do yoga, but it really helps to hear Kriyananda's magnetic voice. I suggest contacting the &quot;student support&quot; e-mail address provided in the introduction for records and cds).<br />Once you begin reading and practicing you'll quickly became impressed with just how comprehensive and easy to use &quot;The Art &amp; Science of Raja Yoga&quot; is.

Babbitt is someone most of us have encountered, or, if we're honest and perceptive enough to admit it, are or have been ourselves.  This makes him very easy to sympathize with and his patriotic, capitalist \\"zippo\\" appeals to the democratic idealism most Americans want so badly to believe in.  We root for him, while despising him at the same time.  We resent being confronted with this mirror of superficiality (or should be, if you disagree with me).  He struggles internally with the discrepencies between the capitalist bag of goods he's been sold, and his own natural desires, values, and free will.  Like most people unwilling or unable to rebel or break out on their own, Babbitt settles on an un-easy compromise: conformity.  This only after humorous, sometimes bold, but ultimately futile attempts to \\"break free\\" (I'm reminded of Jim Carrey's character, Truman, slamming into the mysterious \\"sky/walls\\" of the pre-fab world he's been caged within in the 1998's poignant movie, \\"The Truman Show\\").  Babbitt is punished by society's worst weapon - ostracism - and so we watch him buckle and fold neatly back into the herd.  This is the only book I've ever actually \\"heard\\"; and it's the unmistakable, tragic sound of a spirit breaking in two.  Most sadly of all and even more tragically for society, we understand.	2004-03-18

Pagels never seems to commit to her declared topic, and comes off \\"too unbiased\\" in my opinion. Her research contributes to gnostic studies in almost revolutionary ways, but she never seems to realize the magnitude of her subject matter, and takes an irritatingly bland middle-ground throughout.  Is she a modern gnostic or not?<br />I liked Pagel's earlier book on \\"The Gnostic Gospels\\" better, and was expecting a more detailed, in-depth discussion of the Thomas gospel in this brief tome.  For the lay-reader and simply curious, this is a decent starting point.  If you're looking for more details about gnosticism, she has contemporary recommendations of more recent publications in her bibliography.  Personally, I'd highly recommend the following:  \\"Gnosis\\", by Kurt Rudolph; \\"The Gnostic Religion,\\" by Hans Jonas, & the older, more obscure \\"Fragments of a Faith Forgotten,\\" by GRS Mead.  And, of course, the actual Nag Hammadi Library printed & edited by James Robinson is \\"the source\\" (along with the syntopic Bible).<br />As for \\"Beyond Belief\\", I have to agree with the reviewer responding to \\"Peculiar Reviewers\\" in that there are a handful of seemingly offended people out there who just don't get it when it comes to what gnosticism represents.  It's very much alive and growing world-wide, and many would argue that it's never really disappeared, only taken on new forms.  Pagels illustrates more specifically where and how Catholicism as we know it today came to be, and on what foundations (by ignoring discrepencies between many so-called \\"gnostic\\" texts in favor of the gospel of John, Matthew, Mark and Luke).  She focuses more on John and its similarities and differences with the discarded Thomas gospel, which didn't jibe with the political direction the early church fathers such as Irenaeus were pushing so hard for.<br />\\"Beyond Belief\\" seems to really be a blend of biblical history, and Pagel's personal philosophy of \\"practicing\\" faith instead of simply \\"believing\\"; or reading about it.  Jesus would be proud.eems to really be a blend of biblical history, and Pagel's personal philosophy of \\"practicing\\" faith instead of simply \\"believing\\"; or reading about it.

I was intrigued by the subtitle: \\"Waging War and Keeping Peace with America's Military\\" after trying to think of how many countries (dozens) the United States has committed its military forces to over the past couple decades, and why. Dana Priest had top-level access to various military personnel, visited a number of the countries she discusses, and from this creates an informative document around a major issue confronting our military/civilian leadership; namely, what is \\"The Mission\\"?  She is mostly uncritical (contrary to the impression of previous reviewers who sound offended by the subject matter, as though the military were too holy a subject for any civilian to tackle) and highly complimentary, and informative about our soldiers, and CINc's (Commanders in Chief/theatre command generals).  I think the book would've benefited from a more personal, opinionated account after having done all this research, however, like Mark Bowden (\\"Black Hawk Down\\", \\"Killing Pablo\\") she's a reporter at heart and keeps it pretty straight-forward.<br />\\"The Mission\\" raises fundamental questions about our government's ever-changing world-concept, and the role of our military in advancing goals better suited for diplomats and the UN.  More specifically, she brings up the trend of using our forces for \\"peace-keeping\\" & \\"nation-building\\" missions which they're obviously not well suited for (at this time). Yes, our military is the best at what it does in most cases, but it has serious limitations when we attempt to use it for unclear post-war objectives in countries with broken infrastructure. She provides detailed accounts of Kosovo, where one Lt. Col. wanders the streets and is reminded of his experience in the 1991 debacle of Somalia.  There is a brief and disturbing account of an Army soldier who raped and murdered a young Albanian girl, and details of other negative encounters between young, un-worldly American soldiers and their Serb & Albanian \\"protectees\\".  One interesting chapter deals with the complex world of a female Albanian-American translator trying to fit in with her fellow American soldiers.  Priest also touches on the nature of covert, Special Ops. military training and relations with various troubled countries such as Colombia, Nigeria, and Indonesia.<br />Fundamental questions arise throughout the book:  What exactly is nation-building, and should we be engaged in it? Have we already abandoned Kosovo and Afghanistan?  Do we have the funds, military resources, will-power, justification, or desire to play international policeman?  Will we keep our promises to the peoples we set out to protect?  The answers aren't here, but \\"The Mission\\" sets the table from which this crucial discussion will definitely continue.apter deals with the complex world of a female Albanian-American translator trying to fit in with her fellow American soldiers.

The subjects R. Hagstrom tackles are topics any liberal arts major in college would've already been exposed to in varying degrees, however, for MBA's and those out there who've not yet \\"invested\\" their own time into \\"life's larger issues\\" and subjects, then this book is an excellent jumping off point.<br />On the flip side, those of us who have spent a lot of time studying and thinking about liberal arts, and are new to business and investing but would like to learn more, Hagstrom's book helps synthesize the business/investment world with various disciplines which at first glance seem not to be related, but which in actuality, as Hagstrom shows, are inextricably linked.<br />Overall, I recommend this book along with Peter Lynch's, \\"One Up on Wall Street\\" for serious long-term investors who understand that there's more to life than income producing stocks.	2004-03-17

Crosby was one of the rare &quot;wealthy Bohemians&quot; of the 1920's. While DH Lawrence, Joyce, Crane, Hemmingway &amp; others were stuggling to get by in post war Paris, Crosby was at the Ritz sipping gin cocktails, reading Rimbaud, Baudelaire, &amp; Oscar Wilde. His diary, and life reads like an extravagant surrealist paean to the Sun, to Gold, Absinthe, and Art. After almost being killed as an ambulance driver in WW I, Crosby dedicated himself to following his real passions - namely for women, horse racing, drinking, and poetry. He &amp; his wife (see &quot;The Passionate Years&quot; by Caresse Crosby) formed Black Sun Press, and helped establish the above named struggling writers, as well as others.  SOS is an intriguing journey into the &quot;mad and extravagant life&quot; of a lesser known, eccentric poet from a lost era, and is an essential work for anyone interested in WW I era writers.  I also highly recommend &quot;Black Sun&quot; by G. Wolff, which is a good biography on Harry Crosby and his times.  And also, &quot;Devour the Fire&quot;, by Sy Kahn, if you can find it, is a rare collection of his poetry.	2004-02-11
