Cosmopolis in years to come will be regarded as one of the shining lights of the DeLillo ouvre. This great American writer since the early 70's in his aptly named debut, Americana, has been telling us all what these United States of America is becoming - a country so awash in materialism and the false herald of the religious right that its people cannot understand any mock satiric of its way of life. The Amazon reviews of Cosmopolis reflect this sad fact. Let's make millions on the stretch limo drive to get a haircut. All is vanity in this the ultimate tale of greed.	2005-05-16

She said the novel was like a palindrome in that you could read the chapters backwards. This very unusual literary device is used by the writer to stunning effect. Indeed, I was not too keen on some of the stories in the first half but loved them in the second. This is where the use of connection and coincidence come into play. Though their styles are different Mitchell reminds me of the early Paul Auster in his fascination with chance and fate. <br />I recommend this book highly but I think to really enjoy it you should read Mitchell's debut novel, Ghostwritten, first and don't skip it's epigraph - a quote from Thornton Wilder. A lot of clues to the puzzle that is Cloud Atlas are contained therein. Cloud Atlas can be read again and again to pick up the synchronicity which may affect all our lives. And it is a great and intriguing read.	2005-05-12

First, it is a great story and we see how governments screw up the lives of its constituents through their treachery. We are taught by those in powerful positions not to lie, yet if we tell the truth the innocent may be punished. Secondly, we see how those we should trust abuse their positions. Thirdly, and most of all, Ann-Marie MacDonald gets right into the innocent and trusting mind of a child and tells the young girl's story superbly. Few writers can write from this perspective. Donna Tartt in her, The Little Friend, showed a similar empathy.  If you read this novel you will learn, at whatever stage of life we may be in, it is never wise to place too much trust into those institutions or individuals in positions of authority. This is an important novel which is frighteningly relevant to the modern world. Read it.	2005-05-12

This guy knows about the real American condition and what has happened since the heady Kennedy years. Banks has written previously about ordinary Americans not the solipsistic, successful, sex-crazed stereotypes that inhabit Roth's fiction. The Darling is a brilliant portrayal of what happened to those who had their say in the '60's and more importantly how many of the same people came to blandly accept the inherent attractions of the capitalist way of life and ultimately support the Bush neo-conservatives in this new century. Nowadays even the Wall Street brokers say they didn't vote for Bush in 2004 as he was ruining the economy; forget about the casualties in Iraq.  This novel portrays the hubris of American policy re Liberia where the emancipated slaves were sent to with the attitudes of their former masters, so much that they enslaved the locals. It also portrays, sadly,the powerlessness of the individual to make a difference in the American, read multinational corporate world - a latter day variation of imperialsim euphemisticly and mendaciously described as globalisation.  The Darling is an essential book which shows the impotency of the individual, and, indeed, the third world, in this \\"global village\\". Hannah, in the last sentence of the novel,sadly realises this fact.	2005-05-12

The Australian writer more than fulfills his promise in his second work. What does really happens to us and how do we know if our impressions of life's twists and turns are correct and appropriate?  Seven Types of Ambiguity lets us explore what goes on brilliantly. Each witness sees the same accident differently and in this novel there are seven versions. None of which is completely wrong or right. Perlman writes very well and I found some his asides interesting, especially the one on card counting in blackjack. Some say the book is too long. Maybe, but it is more than worth the effort.	2005-01-31

This novel shows how the horrors of war affect people and also how they look at life and their futures. A lot of people think Ms Hazzard's writing is mannered.

Bay of Souls, like his previous books, has the hero in a personal crisis in a dangerous place. On a tiny Caribbean island there are many dark forces at work and they are not just political.<br />It is an exciting story and Stone's plots are tinged with metaphor. Once again we see how the great powers act in the Third World countries they say they are liberating. As Liz McKie, a Miami Herald reporter, says of the American intervention in St. Trinity &quot;..we don't quite get the bad guys out and the good guys turnout to be not very different from the bad guys and, hey, it's all looking kind of the same as it was.&quot;<br />Some critics have savaged this book and DeLillo's Cosmopolis I think unfairly. It's maybe because these writers say what they think and step on a few toes.This is a great read and is written in taut chilled prose. Read it and decide for yourself.	2003-04-29

Not many novelists can get to the heart of the reader as does Brad Watson in The Heaven of Mercury. Of modern writers David Adams Richards, Richard Flanagan and Roth in his recent American trilogy have been able to achieve this by their understanding of their locale and the intricacies of the human heart. William Faulkner understood the place of home in all his great works.<br />What Brad Watson achieves in this brilliant first novel is simply how the place we are brought up in shapes our lives. The attitudes and prejudices are all there. How do we deal with them? If you read this book you will get more than a clue. As a plus it is a great story<br />This novel is not, as some of your reviewers have suggested, Souhern Gothic but great literature. How it failed to win the National Book Award is beyond me.

This novel has it all with elements of the masters like Faulkner, Borges and Conrad. Some of the book's violence is reminiscent of McCarthy's Blood Meridian.<BR>Most of all it is great story told by one who will become perhaps modern fiction's most unreliable narrator, the liar and thief Billy Gould. If you want to understand the nature and brutality of Van Diemen's Land in the dark days of nineteenth century this is the book. This island now called Tasmania was England's gulag, a brutal penal colony. This was where the riff raff and unlucky players of the Empire ended their days. The native population were not spared either or, indeed at all.Through Gould's wild meanderings we learn what it was like to live at the whim of the colonial masters. And not many were granted mercy.<BR>Flanagan has always had insight into character and the workings of the human heart. In the Book of Fish he has excelled not only with insight but with his vision of society, then and now. The big questions are asked.<BR>This is great novel and is essential reading for those interested in Australian and colonial history, power, human nature and for those who love fantastic writing. Flanagan outdoes Peter Carey's True History of the Kelly Gang here and the way the author winds up his novel is simply dazzling.	2002-03-28

In Chloe Hooper's debut novel the isle of Tasmania features prominently. Tasmania, with its colourful convict past, has been a traditional locale of Australian Gothic. The tradition continued with Mathew Kneale's English Passengers and particularly with Richard Flanagan's fabulous Gould's Book of Fish.<BR>Kate Byrne is a young teacher in a small Australian town outside of Hobart. She has been plunged into a new career and a new way of life very quickly and it appears she is not coping well. An affair with the self centred, boorish father of her brightest pupil does not help. That her lover's wife, who may know of the affair, has just written a true crime story of a recent local murder is disconcerting. When Kate reads Veronica's book she begins to fear for her future.<BR>Without going into the book's ending Ms. Hooper has done very well in her examination of a young woman coming into the adult world. Kate realises childhood was not so complicated and that she must adapt.<BR>The other story in the novel is the imaginary local animals investigation into the true crime. This is fascinating and one is loath to refer to criminals as \\"animals\\" after reading their account.<BR>This a great first novel, well written and a very good and unsettling account of the loss of innocence.

Banville is a quiet, introspective and eloquently descriptive writer. Most of his novels largely avoid plot and instead pay attention not so much to the characters but to the world around them. As such the more you read this author the more you understand and appreciate him.<BR>Eclipse itself is simple. A middle age actor has had enough of life and the stage and retreats to his old family home. However things are not what he expects. Instead of longed for tranquility old problems with life and family persist. And new problems emerge. The actor does not seem able to discern between what is and what is not real.<BR>Are the ghosts and images real or just troubled imaginations? At the end the unreal is something different again. It's a great twist to a ghost story.<BR>Once again Banville's powers of description impress. Few writers, through their prose, can paint the world so well. Eclipse succeeds on many levels.	2002-03-08

In The English Patient he gave us new insight into World War Two and how it affected people of different backgrounds. Anil's Ghost is set in recent times in Sri Lanka; a scene of immense trouble and shocking violence. It is an indictment on us that the Sri Lankan civil war was not all that well known or understood in the western world. With Ondaatje's empathy for his homeland expressed through his lyrical prose we can now reflect on the extreme situations of lesser known parts of the world.<BR>That is one reason why Anil's Ghost should be essential reading. Ondaatje, with his background in the east and the west, can and does explore the maze of Sri Lankan culture and politics. And what powers of observation the writer possesses. There's plenty else too. Archeology,forensic sciences, culture and religion are all examined.<BR>As a bonus it's a great story with and intriguing mystery at the centre of the plot. Highly recommended.	2002-02-12

This book should be read for what it is, an insightful look at the nineteenth century Australian colonial experience. I am sure there were not too many daughters of prison governors, then or now, who had the talents and liberated spirits of the Bronte sisters. If we suspend belief what better way to look at the horrors of the convict and prison system as it existed in the Antipodes of the 1840's than through the eyes of Charlotte, Emily and Anne.<br />Mardi's obvious love of the Brontes' work shines through here without inhibiting the story. The bonus is we have a new perspective on the sisters. And,most importantly, we see how they may have looked at the prison system in Australia (and how colonial life affected women) if they had known of or experienced it in such a way. After all these girls, as is shown by their writings, had an attitude, insight and empathy beyond their years and times. What better way to examine the past than through the adventurous eyes of its contemporaries.<br />This is a great book and possibly the best first novel since Ann-Marie MacDonald's Fall on Your Knees. Oops, I forgot about Wrack by James Bradley. Loved that one too.	2001-10-25

No one know what Marilyn's thoughts and emotions were but this novel does illustrates her insecurities and fears and more importantly who and what caused her problems. It is clear that from childhood and through to stardom, society, those around her and the system gave Marylin little chance at emotional and, ultimately, physical survival.<br />Blonde is an enthralling read and a devestating look at American society in the twentieth century. Indeed, the novel can be favourably compared to De Lillo's Underworld. As in Underworld a lot of real and famous people are depicted and not always in a flattering light. In Blonde the facades are clinically removed.<br />Another thing I really enjoyed was Oates' description of the acting process. All in all Blonde is a great book.	2001-09-28

Most attempts in making novels of real life people tend to fail. Exceptions are Mailer's The Executioner's Song and Capote's In Cold Blood. Along with Kelly the central characters of these stories met their fate in the same way - executed by the state. And now in Carey's True History of the Kelly Gang we learn of Ned's inevitable march to the gallows. Through these tales we may understand what motivates society's criminals. In bringing Ned back to life Peter Carey has done this brilliantly.<br />In the True History Carey has looked anew at a timeless story. One which is just as relevant today. How much is one's environment responsible for the illegal actions of an otherwise decent man. Yet, despite all his disadvantages, Ned Kelly emerges as a man of much depth, compassion and intelligence. Ned cared much for his fellow Irish-Australians and the other dispossessed choking under the English yoke in the colony of Victoria in the nineteenth century.<br />What'smore I loved how Carey has truly captured Ned's voice. A voice that shows a lack of education but a great depth of insight and understanding of his times. And what exciting times they were.<br />A great book by a writer who has now reached the height of his powers. If one wants to understand what, hopefully, lies at the heart of the Australian character then this is, as Ned's mother would say, the effing book.	2001-02-26

Glen, the knife wielding dwarf, is right out of Chinatown. All that  apart Bingham wrote well and certainly maintains interest with the quirky  dialogue of his main characters. The plot, though, is far too contrived.  The idea of the troubled lovers going to the beach by the train in a strife  torn Cambodia was just ridiculous.

Elliot, a therapist, apparently is in need of healing himself. Like a lot of Stone's characters Elliot has a  drinking problem and he is forced to face his own devils. Despite 15 months  of being dry his life lacks substance and any excitement. Regrets and  desperation are beginning to tease Elliot. Anger is rising.<br />Then, after  couselling a discharged army guy, who has nightmares about Vietnam when in  fact he was never there, Elliot (who was) goes on a spree. He returns home  and argues with his wife, a social worker who has her own troubles. Other  problems arise and the story could easily have ended in tragedy. Instead it  ends with a faint ray of hope for a lost man wanting Grace, his wife, to  believe in him and offer forgiveness. The last paragraphs are very  moving.<br />What  I really like about Helping is how Stone brilliantly  captures some dilemnas of the &quot;recovering alcoholic&quot; which is in  Elliot's case how do you cope with the ordinariness of sobriety. How do you  get back to stability when the world you live in is becoming increasingly  unreliable? How do you handle the dangers of unresolved anger? <br />Once  again Robert Stone, with his crisp prose, exposes the psyche of the  troubled man without being at all didactic. He just lets the issues  confronting Elliot reveal themselves.	2000-03-29

We shouldn't like Thomas Chipperling at all but as we read on the more we get to feel for the man. Sure Thomas lies to all his women and girls but at the same time he does not spare deceiving  himself.<br />Eveyone knows someone like Thomas C. who thinks he is just great  with the opposite sex but is viewed by the world as an overheated buffon.  Despite Thomas' self absorption, pomposity, arrogance,lack of awareness and  self pity one cannot engender much sympathy for his conquests be they real  or imagined. The only woman one feels for is the long suffering Mrs. Robert  Kooshof who is rather an ambiguous figure. Is she a deserted beauty or a  kind hearted frump? Another puzzle is whether Thomas C. is always telling  the truth. What's real and what isn't?<br />Overall this is a great sendup of  modern romantic life with all its insincerity and insecurity. I did like  O'Brien's twists on linguistics. The tomcat's pithy little comments were  fun. For example when he spoke of the tollgate at the end of the road to a  woman's heart. <br />I was sorry to see this book end and I hope for a sequel.  What will happen to Thomas and Mrs.K?	1999-08-17
