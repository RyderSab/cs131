See, she's died once already (which sucked), got reincarnated in the form of a Djinn (which was cool, but, ultimately, sucked) and has since been returned to living flesh (much cooler, though now she has to pee after long car drives, and she never noticed how much that sucked before being a Djinn). <br />  <br />Not that she's negative. <br />  <br />Born a weather warden, Joanne can manipulate and control the air and water, and is a member of the Wardens, a group determined to do two things: keep as many humans alive in the much-more-volatile-than-you-know Earth, and stay a secret. The first isn't going so well, the second seems pretty dicey, too. <br />  <br />So, when the most powerful fella about with powers over all the elements has his powers stolen from him by a punk boy with major psychological trauma, and said punk boy also steals the world's most powerful Djinn, things get pretty nasty, pretty fast. And Joanne is pretty sure that people are trying to kill her (again). <br />  <br />What's a girl to do? Well, getting some kick-ass shoes, a fast car, and a dress that leaves just enough to imagination is a good start. The rest she'll come up with as she goes. <br />  <br />A load of fun as always, the writing of Rachel Caine is right up there with Jim Butcher and the early (non-overdosed) Laurel K. Hamilton. It rocks, but I'd suggest you start with \\"Ill Wind,\\" which was the first book in the series. <br />  <br />'Nathan	2005-02-09

Okay, before I begin, I'd like to point you towards my reviews of 'It Had to Be You,' and 'He's the One,' and to say, simply, \\"Go; Buy; Enjoy.\\" It's not that you'd be totally lost reading these out of order (I came at the series ass-backwards with the ass book first, so to speak), but I would have to say that the third book won't have the same gut-punching beginning if you've not read the other two. <br />  <br />Namely, the position of Blaine and Daniel as ex-boyfriends. <br />  <br />It's not just that I've become something of a romantic since I actually manage to land one of those ephemeral 1% of sane gay men to date (no really, they exist!) - I read the other two when I was hip deep in single status, and they were quite an uplifting read. They had candy content, don't get me wrong (I mean, hello, everyone is described deliciously), but there were a few scenes that made me stop and think, which one doesn't often expect in fun reading. Most specifically, the \\"two saddest words\\" component of one of the tales ground me to a halt, until I finally found my own personal answer, and it has become a standard question I ask of people by the by. <br />  <br />Geez - am I still talking about the other two books? Right. On topic. <br />  <br />\\"I'm Your Man,\\" starts with Blaine being single, Daniel being his ex, and the reader absolutely stunned that Timothy James Beck could be so heartless as to make us suffer through the notion of these two without each other. Sadists. But, like any good romantic, that horrible shred of hope kept me going past those awful first pages (they-broke-up/they-broke-up/they-broke-up hammering in my head all the while) and I found - as usual - that Timothy James Beck delivered a solid bit of work. <br />  <br />Blaine and his best pal Gretchen (also single, though in her case more repetitively and steadfastly so) decide that little swimmy Blaines and little ovulating Gretchens might be a nifty way to have child. The fallout in Blaine's life is a joy to read, as Blaine navigates a lot of what family is supposed to mean (and often doesn't). Blaine's a character you can slip into fairly well - his mental processes, though sometimes leaving you fit to smack his mythical head around for a few hours, make sense internally, and you can see why he is the way he is. It's also refreshing to read a gay character who isn't all that stereotypically gay conscious - the poor guy hasn't got a clue how to handle transgendered issues, has more than a little bit to learn about fashion, and can be more than a little bit ignorant. Even my usual slight friction with the perfectly sculpted super-hot muscle stud image didn't seem to rub the wrong way in this novel, which says a bit about how well he was written. Blaine goes to the gym a lot, so it's not like an Andy Schell novel where the hero fella suddenly has gym payoff when we've been with him every hour of almost every day and he's never even seen the inside of the gym. <br />  <br />The long and the short of it (and more long than short, I admit, as I fear I'm gushing at this point), Timothy James Beck gave me what I really wanted most: characters. Daniel is still Daniel - but an evolving Daniel. Ditto Blaine, and Adam, and Shiela, and all the other host of characters that make up the Beck world.  <br />  <br />Personally, I'm ready for book four. I might even manage to read that one in more than a single day, to draw it out a little bit... <br />  <br />'Nathan	2005-01-30

I love the Joanne Kilbourn mystery series for a few major facets: <br />  <br />(1) The heroine is an independant widowed woman with a strong sense of family, and yet is not reduced to being a simpering victim or wailing emotional wreck. She handles things, and handles them as well as any one could. <br />  <br />(2) The strong Canadian content to the stories: be it simple things like surnames that show a european background, or native rights issues, or any number of uniquely Canadian flavours, Bowen finds a niche for them in her books that adds to the story. <br />  <br />(3) The mystery is always a good one, and hard to puzzle out any faster than her heroine. <br />  <br />Joanne retires to a languid summer at \\"Lawyer's Bay,\\" where one power law firm seems to rool the roost. When a shocking suicide starts the vacation on a dark turn, Joanne once again finds herself in the middle of the lives of those around her, trying to dig out the dark secrets, and learn if the suicide was even that. When her ex-lover Alex Kequahtooway gets involved, things seem even more personal. The tension keeps rising, and as always, Bowen delivers a stunning finale. Well done.  <br />	2005-01-25

I threw up my Rice Crispies late this morning due to some graphic content colliding heads with my really off stomach. <br />  <br />If you've not read Gardner before, she's really worth it - on par with Lisa Scottoline, Kathy Reichs, Tami Hoag and - dare I say it? - Harlen Coben.  Her psychological thrillers have extremely rich characters, and rarely does she give you the pat \\"female victim\\" role.  Her women fight back, fight dirty, and sometimes spend the entire book making you wonder if they're the villain in the first place. <br />  <br />\\"Alone\\" is about a survivor.  Catherine was snatched by a pedophile when she was young, trapped in a dark hole in the ground, and abused for nearly a month.  She was found and rescued at random, but has never quite since gotten over her fear of the dark.  Years have passed - she has a child, a husband, a life, and now suddenly, things have gone wrong.  Bobby, a police SWAT sniper, responds to Catherine's call that her husband has a gun and is threatening the family.  In a split second decision, he shoots the husband to save the wife and child. <br />  <br />But things aren't at all as simple as they seem - and it might be that someone arranged all of it. <br />  <br />Solid thriller, with a mystery as tangled as you can ask for from an author that is very good at so far not growing at all stale with her plot ideas.  Even better was the cameo from a \\"The Perfect Husband\\" charater, which I always like: it lends a sense of continuity and realism to the tale when you bump into other wounded people still going on with their lives. <br />  <br />Long story short, go get it, read it, and you'll be just as wrapped up as I was.	2005-01-25

Basically, there are folk in the world who are capable of touching - and manipulating - the elements of fire, air, water, and earth. Jo is has air and water (which very often go together), and is one of the strongest weather wardens around, as she uses her abilities to calm weather patterns, stop as many storms as possible, that sort of thing. <br />  <br />Or at least, she did before all the rest of the Wardens in the world starting hunting her, since she just happened to kill someone and can't quite prove it was, well, self-defense. Sort of. So, Jo is on the run, trying to track down the rarest of the rare, a friend of hers who has access to all four elements (and more importantly, has some spare djinn bottles kicking around, since she also inherited a bit of a terminal problem as well, and it takes a djinn to fix it)... <br />  <br />Meanwhile, the storms are chasing her with mindless intent, her own former co-workers and friends are chasing her down, and her car needs more gas. <br />  <br />Jo is a superb character - if you love a tough-talking, trash-talking, ne'er do well type with an acid tongue, kick-ass attitude, a lot of magical power, dress sense (think leather and/or Victoria's Secret) and a thing for fast cars. She rocks. I jumped immediately into \\"Heat Stroke\\" at the end of this book because the ending of this book left me rolling. If you liked Jim Butcher's \\"Harry Dresden\\" series, or if you enjoy \\"Anita Blake\\" from Laurell K. Hamilton (but are tired of the over-the-top constant S&M sex that seems to have diluted the story so much lately), this is the book for you. <br />  <br />'Nathan	2004-09-23

Here's the thing - I love Camilla MacPhee. She's cranky, in-your-face, witty, sarcastic as all hell, and always catches the bad guy (usually with the help of her obnoxious ne'er do well secretary, Alvin). I've read the Camilla MacPhee mysteries by Mary Jane Maffini each and every time a new one has come out, since the first time I met her and thought, &quot;Wow, now here's a lady with style.&quot; <br />  <br /> This book? It's not a Camilla MacPhee mystery. I chewed my lip. I pondered. I bought (of course) and had her autograph it for me, but a small little voice said, &quot;But what if it's not as good as Camilla?&quot; <br />  <br /> No worries. First off, Fiona Silk is just as fun a character, albeit in a strikingly different way. Fiona has similar sarcastic comments, but she tends to keep them as thoughts, and she's a pushover for a sob-story (or, indeed, for pretty much any request - she's missing the &quot;just say no!&quot; gene). She's a failed romance writer (and the parts where her &quot;romance novel&quot; is glimpsed by the reader are a real blast), living in the small fictional Quebec town of St. Aubaine, which is resoundingly familiar for those of us nearby another Quebec town, lemme tellya. <br />  <br /> Someone offs a man she had an almost fling with eight-nine years ago, and leaves him naked in her bed, with a crazy-glue applied sly grin to greet her. Fiona's alibi of being three-sheets-to-the-wind, not to mention her passing out drunk when she saw him and not reporting it until the morning, leave her a little bit in the lurch. So, with the police after her, gossip lingering, and the media hot on her tail, Fiona has to get over being a pushover, before someone else pushes her over permanently. <br />  <br /> Delightful, funny, and - as always - full of a razor sarcastic wit, Mary Jane Maffini once again delivers a grand little mystery. I do look forward to the next Fiona Silk... just please, a Camilla first? <br />  <br /> 'Nathan <br />	2004-07-22

I bought this for two reasons: One, I really enjoyed Heather Jarman's work on the character of Shar (the Andorian) and wanted to continue his tale in her voice. Two, I needed mind-candy. Bad. <br />  <br /> This delivers on both fronts. McCormack's 'Cardassia' story is a bit thin, a straightfoward hostage taking, though it has the virtue of including Keiko and Miles O'Brien (who have been missing mostly from the relaunch of DS9 given that they retired to Earth at the end of the series - but Keiko moved to Caradassia to help rebuild its ecology). Also present, of course, is Garak, but I find that without Doctor Bashir, his character just sort of degrades into a base manipulator with no real redeeming qualities. The inclusing of Vedek Yevir, a character introduced earlier in the DS9 relaunch, however, was a stroke of genius, and well appreciated by me.  <br />  <br /> 'Andor' is where this book shines, however. Jarman delivers yet another superb telling of the Andorian four-gendered culture, the fallout thereof, and some really interesting ethical genetic dilemmas that face the people since Shar's discovery a few books back. Shar and Prynn make an interesting couple - without bordering overmuch on the &quot;Will they or won't they?&quot; crap of most romance in Science Fiction. Definitely worthwhile for the relaunch, or DS9 fans of any stripe (of interesting note is that none of the original series characters pop up in 'Andor,' only the newbies to the DS9 station are involved). <br />  <br /> High-calorie mind candy. <br />  <br /> 'Nathan	2004-07-22

As always with a collection of writings, it's hard to decide where to stand on the collection as a whole.  I daresay that Pohl-Weary did a damned fine job thematically and with the organization (there is a definite sense of, well, sense to the order in which the pieces are presented), but the quality of the works does vary quite a bit.<BR> <BR>The highlight, for me, was \\"'Cuz the Black Chick Always Gets it First,\\" by Candra K. Gill, a solid bit of work on the dynamics of race in 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer,' - it's refreshing to find a fan who can deconstruct a show for its weaknesses, not just its strengths, and balancing both in the same entry was a nice touch.<BR> <BR>The lowpoint, for me, was actually an artwork piece.  Shary Boyle has a panel of five or six pages, which ran the gamut of a wonderful piece with a frumpy lady flying with birds, to a very angry looking woman with a baseball bat.  But the piece that really threw me off was one where three young girls of various racial descent are holding a man pinned in a kneeling position - one little girl holding his hands behind his back, one with her foot on his groin, in a pose that speaks of pressure application, and one with a knife to the man's throat.<BR> <BR>Now - I think there was an aim for role-reversal here - the typical (and factual in the majority of cases) white male pedophile.  Reversed, this picture would be a disturbing violent piece about a pedophile, a predator, a sick tableau of violence.  Instead, we have a sick tableau of violence where three little girls threaten a man's life, and we are left to assume the man has done something bad (since, for all that I can attempt to project here, it's not like one can point a finger at a row of men and say \\"Normal, normal, pedophile, normal...\\")  Like I said, I think it aimed for role-reversal; it missed.<BR> <BR>All in all, however, this was a solid bit of editing - prose and nonfiction both, some graphic novels, some artwork (the rest of the pictures byShary Boyle, I should note, I quite enjoyed), all of it of a decent enough calibre to be substantive in total.<BR> <BR>Definitely worth a bite.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2004-07-13

This is another fantastic book from the author of 'Practical Magic,' 'Blue Diary,' and 'The Probable Future.' Nora Silk is not the typical woman of 1959 Long Island. She's divorced, has two children, and never seems to care if they get dirty while they play. She wears high heels and black stretch pants, and her nails are always done in bright colours. Her eldest son, Billy, tends to pick stray thoughts out of the minds of people around him, and James, only months-old, eats anything he can find in one chubby cute hand. When they move onto the street where the norm is two parents, two children, and nothing unexpected, Nora Silk is ostracized, Billy is bullied, and it seems that the status quo will always regain its balance.<BR> <BR>But the men start to notice Nora's distinct grace with more than a bit of lust, and Nora's comments and advice to the women start to break cracks in the veneer of &quot;we should do what we have always done.&quot; Sparks fly, a trace of magic is in the air, and before long, 1959 is going to roll over into the sixties, and Nora Silk's influence will be felt by all.<BR> <BR>I adored this book - much as I adored the previously mentioned Hoffman titles I listed above - and had that trademarked Hoffman lump in my throat when the book was drawing to a close. As always, it's the characters - and the level of empathy you feel for all of them - that keep you going, and Hoffman's deft touch with a trace of the supernatural always leaves you charmed. A ghost here, a clairvoyant there, and a tangled thread of folk remedies throughout, there's something magical in how she writes, and how the reader feels while watching her worlds.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2004-06-27

Books	4	15	17	N	N	Intruiging and fresh approach to Sci-Fi	I inherited this book from a friend of mine who moved to England, and I must say, I wish I'd read it earlier. At first, the levels of violence were a bit of a turn-off (I'm not keen on massive gun-laden stories), but the society inside this Sci-Fi novel is just so interesting and well-crafted, I forgave the violence to enjoy it.<br />In this future world, everyone is implanted at birth with a &quot;stack,&quot; a chip in the back of neck that keeps your memory and personality on file. If you're murdered, and the stack survives, you're &quot;re-sleeved&quot; into another body (synthetic or not) to testify at your trial. Die of old age? Buy a new sleeve, if you can afford it. The amount of &quot;fallout&quot; in this society due to this technology was astounding, and plausible, and done extremely well by Morgan.<br />At it's heart, this story is a murder mystery, and a story of revenge: someone kills a centuries old &quot;Meth,&quot; (Methuselah), who, dutifully backed up every eight hours, comes back, but with no real idea of what happened in those eight hours to lead to his murder, and quite curious about it, and that Meth hires our hero to figure things out. Our hero of the tale is actually a criminal serving time in a virtual jail (his body is, of course, given to someone who needs it more), and he is beamed to earth from his own colony when the Meth hires him. Wearing someone else's body (which has a fallout of its own), the narrator of the tale tries to figure out who would try to kill a man who'd lived centuries, and why...<br />Between religious and spiritual reasons, hatreds, rivalries, and plain-old-jealousies, there are no shortages of potential murderers, and the tale spins wonderfully. I highly suggest it.<br />'Nathan	2004-06-23

Of the survivors, nine out of ten draw a &quot;joker&quot; and end up deformed in some massive way. Of those one in a hundred survivors who draw neither, they might draw an &quot;ace&quot; (and basically end up with super-powers) or a &quot;deuce&quot; (and end up with not-so-super powers).<br /><br />In this collection, a mafia vs. gangs war has broken out in 'Jokertown' where most of the deformed Jokers live, a ghetto in New York, and between the mafia, the gangs, the aces and jokers involved, things get ugly. There is also the continuation of two other plots - the sincerely disturbing Ti Malice, the hate-mongering Reverand Leo Barnett, and the hidden Ace Gregg Hartman, whose powers of manipulation are pulling him further and further towards presidency. The cast of characters are just as solid as ever, and I, for one, was very happy to see the return of the Turtle, my favourite character to date.<br /><br />Solid stuff, with a nice ending that makes you twinge for the next in the series, which I shall order post haste...<br /><br />'Nathan	2004-06-04

It was just as good as 'Burndive,' in that the characters were rich, the galaxy very strongly detailed, and the conflicts both interesting and plausible.<BR> <BR>The storyline is one of abused trusts - when a young boy named Jos survives the slaughter of most of his spaceship, he is taken by a pirate, and basically raped and abused for a year of his life, with the pirate's attempt to turn Jos into the perfect companion and tool. Jos manages to escape, only to be taken in by the enemies of mankind, aliens (and those few traitorous humans who empathise with them). There, Jos is enfolded into the arms of the assassin-leader of the sympathizers, and learns to feel good in a culture that seems gentle and caring and compassionate by comparison. And when he, too, is trained to defend this way of life, he is asked by the man he trusts the most to go undercover among the human soldiers and act as a spy.<BR> <BR>Jos's feelings and confusion over his loyalties are very evocative - he finds people to love on all sides of the three-way-war, and his intense mental control, in direct contrast to his inability to handle his own reflection (and rarely being able to tolerate even a caring touch) make him a remarkably well written character that evokes reader empathy.

It is a darkly superstitious tale, and one where the main character's brother was born on Christmas Eve, and therefore considered, by local superstition, to be a loup-garou (werewolf).<BR> <BR>The story focuses more on the elder son, our hero of the tale, as he tries to cope with his own fears about his brother, his duty to protect his brother (his mother's dying request), and the awareness that anyone different is in danger in this paranoid city.

Fforde's world is awash in literary love (a world I'd love to visit for that aspect alone), and yet, enter the villain: Archeron Hades. This fellow is bad, bullet-proof, has powers of suggestion, never casts a shadow (nor does he show up on videotape), and a host of other abilities. Also, he nabbed Thursday's uncle, who has built a device to hop in and out of books. When Hades kidnaps Jane Eyre, things get a bit dodgy, and it's up to our intrepid heroine to go deep under cover - or between the book covers, as it were, to sort things out.<BR> <BR>Hilarious and fun, and chock-o-block with puns, amusing character names, and odd out-of-synch bits and pieces about the world Thursday lives in (though, I must admit, some of her father's antics make me wonder if he's trying to 'fix' the timestream back to what would be our world, more or less). Also, she has a pet dodo. I want one. They say, 'plock plock!'<BR> <BR>You won't regret this one. Really. Read it next - pinky swear that you will. With thumb-press.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2004-05-19

On the other hand, I learned of far too many mistakes I make, daily, throughout my own writings and musings.<BR> <BR>It is Truss's wit that keeps you reading.

Illustrated by Timothy Basil Ering, this John Newberry Medal winner was an absolute treat to read. The chapters, which are quite short, are split among four \\"books\\" which move from character to character, and have a wonderful tendancy to talk directly to the reader. <BR> <BR>At its heart, this is a tale about hope. First, there is Despereaux, a tiny little mouse with big ears, who isn't very mouse-like, and breaks all sorts of mouse rules (especially the big ones: don't talk to humans, and don't let them touch you). When Princess Pea touches his head and says he's cute, this little mouse falls in love. An odd little guy, he has read a fairy tale, and takes it to heart, hoping that there is such a thing as a knight in shining armor, and a happily ever after.<BR> <BR>The Princess herself is also a vivid and fun character, a young girl who isn't very used to not getting her own way, and has very little malice in her heart, and a whole lot of empathy. <BR> <BR>The other two characters - Chiaroscuro the rat and Miggory Sow, the oft clouted mostly deaf, overweight servant girl, are both villains and not-villains - it's quite easy to feel sorry for them, to understand their plight, and realize that they, too, have hope.<BR> <BR>It is a soft little story with some gruesome bits sure to make any child 'ooh' and 'aah' appreciatively, and it is definitely on its way to my nephew, who I think will get a kick out of talking mice swashbuckling with sewing needles, and cauliflower eared serving girls who bumble their way towards a better place. The prose in no way talks down to children by using overly simple languages - there are even passages that suggest the child look up a few words if they don't know them - and I'm always greatful for an intelligently written work.<BR> <BR>So - do you believe in happily ever after?<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2004-04-29

I've listened to Legal Tender, and Dead Ringer, and I'm hooked. I'll be scouting around for more of her work as soon as I can find it.<BR> <BR>Unlike the other two I've listened to on audiobook prior to Moment of Truth, this story isn't about Bennie Rosato, the snarky, sarcastic, tough-as-nails Philedelphia attourney I've grown to love, but Mary Di Nunzio, one of her associates. Bennie is away, and while she's gone, a man confesses to murdering his wife. But he didn't do it. He takes Mary as his lawyer, figuring she's so inexperienced she can only make it worse, and proceeds to try and get himself found guilty. What would bring a grown man - and lawyer - to implicate himself for murder? Who is he trying to protect? Is the killer going to strike again? Mary is going to find out, and it just might kill her.<BR> <BR>The story is quite tricky, and I was very pleased to say that while I figured out a good two-thirds of it, the ultimate ending did surprise me. Hats off, once again, to Lisa Scottoline, who apparently doesn't mulch a usual formula out over and over, and kept me guessing. Mary is just as interesting a character to explore as Bennie Rosato, which is a nice touch for what I'd so far only seen as a secondary character. There's a slight romantic undertone to this tale, which also went well with the overall.<BR> <BR>As always, I can't praise Kate Burton's voice-acting enough. Her ability to put emotion into the various voices - and use her voice talent to keep the characters so obviously different to the listener's ear - cannot be over-stated. She's superb.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2004-04-27

So, whenever I saw her books, I nabbed them. But, truth be told, I'd not started reading them. Recently, I listened to 'Legal Tender,' and really enjoyed it, and so when I saw this and another Lisa Scottoline available on audio, I nabbed it.<BR> <BR>We return to Bennie Rosato and find her just as snarky, sarcastic, and tough as ever. The reader still being Kate Burton really helped, as she's got the perfect voice for the character. <BR> <BR>Now, since I've been reading this out of order, some characters I knew weren't in it (apparently, the relationship that began in 'Legal Tender' didn't work out, for one), and I didn't know that Bennie had a twin (I must have missed a book between this and the last one). But when her twin starts to show up and make malicious attempts to ruin Bennie's life, things get interesting. Especially when Bennie's own little law firm is on the financial rocks. And when her biggest client ends up murdered, Bennie's in real trouble - because what if the murderer is her twin? Or are they unrelated? Or, is someone else also trying to ruin Bennie?<BR> <BR>Solid stuff, this story, interesting, and the mystery had me confounded (bonus points for that). Thumbs-up, especially for Kate Burton's reading voice.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2004-04-23

This is an even shorter tale than the first young adult Hoffman I read, \\"Green Angel.\\"<BR> <BR>Basically, the tale of \\"Indigo,\\" is the tale of a young girl, Martha Glimmer, who is coming of age in a painful environment - her father is currently quite numb after the death of her mother nearly a year earlier, and her thirteenth year of life seems as unlucky as the reputation of the number. She disdains her town - it is a plain, dry place where floods in the past have left the whole town wary of water in any form. They have blocked off the creek, dried up the town, and it rarely rains. This is Hoffman at her slightly-magical best.<BR> <BR>Martha's best friends, nicknamed Trout and Eel, are two water-loving boys who have never seen the ocean. Their fingers and toes are webbed, and their dreams are of the endless waters. Together, the three decide to run to something else, and in leaving learn about who they are, and what home really is.<BR> <BR>A soft and touching (and very very short) tale, this is happily recommended to those who enjoy their young adult reading with a dash of magic, and a depth of emotions.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2004-04-22

Martin (editor), this is a &quot;shared world&quot; series, where various authors get together and write in the same world.  The world is one where an alien virus was dumped into the air shortly after WWII, and still randomly infects people nearly forty years later.<BR> <BR>The virus - called the Wild Card for its very random results - proliferated in earth's atmosphere.  First, nine in ten people who contract the Wild Card virus &quot;draw the Queen of Spades,&quot; and die.  Of the survivors, nine in ten people &quot;draw a Joker,&quot; and end up hideously disfigured.  Of the non-Joker survivors, some draw a &quot;deuce,&quot; and get a power or ability that's pretty much useless (&quot;I can change my hair colour at will!&quot;), but many who survive as non-jokers &quot;draw an Ace,&quot; and gain super-powers.  The massively telekinetic Turtle, the projective teleporter Popinjay (who I really liked in this book), the any-lizard shapeshifter Kid Dinosaur - these are some of the Aces.  They're solid, fun to read, and quite well drafted.  <BR> <BR>This story all takes place in one day, and the novel is very well sewn together (especially given the different tones and styles of the various authors) and has a very complicated and complex interwoven plot.  Kudos to Martin for wrapping it up so well.<BR> <BR>This forty years later is the anniversary and what is likely to be the largest &quot;Wild Card Day&quot; celebration ever - except one recurring villain is using this day to kill off all the Aces who bested him in the previous books...

It's always three in the morning in Nightside, and the Powers and Authorities of Nightside are often quite hideous, depraved, and full of divine (or demonic) power.  Basically, think Charles De Lint on a really dark/grim/gruesome bent, or mayhap Anne Rice without all the lace and frilly stuff, or Laurel K. Hamilton without the mind-numbing repetetive sex.<BR> <BR>Our \\"hero\\" in the tale is John Taylor (no, not the singer).  He's a PI whose mother was something other than human (emphasis on the 'other').  He has a preternatural gift: he can just find things, by opening his third eye/inner sight.  Alas, that also sets of a big ol' glow throughout Nightside that says \\"here I am!\\" and he has enemies aplenty, so quite often he has to rely on wits instead of his powers.  <BR> <BR>The plot in this third book is basically thus:  A father hires John to figure out what is going on with his daughter, who is a rising-star singer in the Nightside who seems to be causing her fans to kill themselves (smiling while they do so).  Are her agents to blame?  Did she sell her soul for fame?  Can you wash brains out of sling back high heels?  All these questions and more are posed in this gritty gruesome bloodbathy fun urban dark fantasy mystery.  Mind-candy wise, this is fulfilling, but it's not at all difficult reading or a confounding mystery - I had the villains figured out at first mention.  Still, it's okay to pass some time.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2004-04-20

A young adult novel by an author I truly admire, I really liked this very (very) short tale. A rather vague disaster strikes a city (one is left with the notion that it was a large bombing of some sort), and a girl's family is left for dead. This girl, Green, stayed home, didn't say a proper goodbye that day, and suffers a truly evocative survivor's guilt.<BR> <BR>We see Green's view through smudged eyes, and as she withdraws into a cocoon of non-emotion, she tattooes herself with black vines, black roses, black bats, shears her hair short, and turns inward. As she encounters other survivors, and moves toward healing, Hoffman's intense prose style really shines through with the emotionality of all the characters.<BR> <BR>Stirring work - I know I would have loved it as a younger reader, and even as an adult, I quite enjoyed it, despite it being so very brief.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2004-04-13

The characters of Detectives Sam Kovac and Nikki Liska return - Nikki was definitely a high point of 'Ashes to Ashes,' - and get hit by a pair of very confusing deaths. One, a &quot;cold-case&quot; of the beating-death of a cop, and the other, an apparent suicide of an IA cop. But is it suicide? Is the criminal charged in the cold-case beating death really the one who killed the cop? Why was the IA man looking into the night his father, a legend cop, was shot and paralyzed, and what does it have to do with all the other things going on? <BR> <BR>Honestly, the mystery in this one had me turning - I couldn't decide who to look at as the villain in the piece, and I was very well rewarded for my efforts - I got about a third of it right, enough to make me feel all clever, and yet enough to be outsmarted and enjoy the ride. I'm definitely going to look into more Tami Hoag.<BR> <BR>The voice actor in this one was also way above the level of 'Ashes to Ashes,' which is always a good thing.

Kate, who has suffered a familial loss years ago, and is trying to get past it, doesn't normally work with kids (and of course, the witness is a kid). <BR> <BR>So, who is the killer? Can Kate withstand the FBI agent arriving (who is a man she sought comfort with during her familial collapse)? Can the police figure it out before more people are killed? Well, in true thriller style, the tension gets jacked up a notch at a time, and the characters - though often walking stereotypes (the dark angst-ridden FBI profiler, the tough-rough-around-the-edges detective, the hard-ass victims rights advocate) - are interesting enough to keep you going. I'll be heading onward to 'Dust to Dust' soon.<BR> <BR>The only caveat with this one was the reading voice - the woman doing the reading didn't have a great deal of versatility with the reading of male voices, and some of them came across like cartoons. This was especially bad when in the voice of the killer during the climactic scene, but it didn't completely intrude or throw me off.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2004-04-13

The demons of LJ and Bookcrossing (otherwise known as &quot;those people who tell me of too many good books&quot;) told me about this one. It's an Science Fiction anthology about the introduction into Earth of an alien virus, just after World War II. This virus, which has major (and varied) genetic effects, is quickly named 'the Wild Card virus.' <BR> <BR>Of those who encounter a Wild Card particle (it's not contagious, just floating around for you to breathe in or drink up or...), nine out of ten draw the Black Queen (so to speak) and die. Of the one in ten that survive, nine in then of those suffer genetic affects that leave them like freakshow carnival subjects - insectlike, lizardlike, or otherwise of obvious mutant ugly stature. They're said to have drawn a Joker. Now, those other one in the ten who survive, they're the ones who drew an Ace - they get, for lack of a better way of putting it - powers.<BR> <BR>The chronology of the series is superb - the Ace/Joker/Wild Card impact on the McCarthy era, for example, was very well done. The stories lead further and further toward the contemporary era, and the characterization of the various Aces and Jokers is a joy to read. <BR> <BR>So, if you're at all into science fiction in a contemporary or recent historical setting, this is the stuff for you.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2004-04-05

From a plot point of view, this book is very, well, linear.  Boy Shepherd has a dream, gets it interpreted, learns of treasure buried by the pyramids, talks to a wise king, learns he is on a quest for his personal legend, travels to Egypt, etc etc.  There are no real plot twists (beyond one near the end), and the story is simple and straightforward.<BR> <BR>And, still, somehow, both spiritually interesting and thought-provoking.

I'm a little surprised to finally be saying this, but...<BR> <BR>...I wasn't so keen on this book. Now, granted, I'll happily caveat that this was on an abridged audio edition by Nova, and I am a huge fan of Alice Hoffman to begin with, and this is not her recent novel. But, somehow, it left me a little cold.<BR> <BR>Mostly, I believe it was because there was no typical Hoffman magic or mystery to the story. A woman named March returns to her home town with her daughter when her housekeeper dies. After the funeral, she finds herself drawn towards a young man who was raised in her household by her father, with whom she had a strong, nigh co-dependant relationship with in her youth.<BR> <BR>They start an affair, the relationship definitely takes a sombre turn (or three), and then, all at once, the book sort of ends. The ending was almost trite, actually. Much like 'Second Nature,' this one didn't do much at all beyond mundane and angry relationship angst, and it left me a little tired on behalf of all the characters concerned. Indeed, there wasn't a single character in the tale for whom I felt relief, or gained a sense of 'they've been saved' about, which is something I adore about Hoffman usually. Even the language seemed less lyrical and immediate.  All of that isn't to say the book was bad, just not up to Hoffman's usual wonder-inspiring work.<BR> <BR>Perhaps I just need a break from her, but either way, this in no way reached the intense wonderful levels of writing I know and love Hoffman for, like in 'Blue Diary,' 'River King,' 'Practical Magic,' 'Local Girls,' and 'The Probable Future.'<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2004-02-25

I met the author, and she was one fabulous lady, and she signed this for me and everything. She was interesting, and more importantly, she was witty. I had high hopes.<BR> <BR>Now, perhaps that's the problem - this is a Leisure Books Horror line novel, and methinks that the emphasis for this series is more of a gorey horror/suspense feel, sort of like watching an episode of 'the Twilight Zone,' but bloodier. But, and this is doubly unfortunate as I no longer have a long bus ride to work in the morning and evening, I nibbled at this book for almost two full weeks and beyond the heroine's name (Gabrielle), I don't remember much about her, apart from her ludicrous taste in men.<BR> <BR>Basically, there are random bee attacks. Then bird attacks. And between these, you jump, hap-hazardly, between various characters and get snippits of their lives, pasts, remembrances, and current stresses. All in all, it gets very jumpy and confused, and you're not sure it'll wrap itself up into a single plot conclusion.<BR> <BR>Well, it does all end in one place and event, but it made me blink a little in confusion and disbelief. <BR> <BR>Still, the ideas behind the plot of this book were really quite interesting, it's just that the implementation seemed a bit... off.

If you've not read McDevitt, and are at all a fan of Science Fiction, you need to go out there and find yourself a copy of 'The Engines of God,' 'Infinity Beach,' 'Deepsix,' and 'Chindi.' Now. If you're not a huge fan of Science Fiction, let me tell you, though there's some astrophysics in there, McDevitt writes a lot more sociologically, adventure-action, and philosophically than nearly any other contemporary science fiction author I know, with the exception of Robert J. Sawyer.  That said, his style is quite deft, as is Sawyer's, and a lot of people just don't 'get' it - as is obvious from some of the reviews written here.  I happily suggest reading a chapter in the store prior to purchase, though I've yet to meet someone while working in my bookstore's Sci-Fi section who didn't like McDevitt.<BR> <BR>Okay, fan-boy praising hereby endeth.<BR> <BR>The story picks up the character of Priscilla Hutchins (who, now married and with a kiddy, plays a much more administrative and planet-bound role) and the storyline of the Omega clouds. Strange clouds that pop up, find anything remotely geometrical (especially, say, buildings), and blast them to bits. They're all over the universe, but why worry, as the one heading towards earth is not due for another, oh, nine hundred years. Yawn.<BR> <BR>But one of them being tracked by the Academy makes a right turn, and this time, in McDevitt's nearly lifeless galaxy, seems to be setting its sights on levelling an alien race who are somewhere around the Ancient Greece level of evolution. In about nine months.<BR> <BR>The race is on - but to do what? Try to stop the cloud - no one knows how. Try to save the race - again, how do you save a race that's about to be hit by tsunamis, tidal waves, tornadoes and all the other horrid things the Omega clouds do? Obviously, it would be wrong to step in, break protocol, and talk to the natives?<BR> <BR>Right?<BR> <BR>Thestory is very high paced, and as is always McDevitt's style, you never know who will make it to the end (he is not above killing off a character in a completely realistic fashion - by which I mean there's no hero capable of dodging all the bullets all the time), and his tendancy to through in a few philosophical characters absolutely shines in this book. McDevitt, as always, delivered a solid adventure worthy of any Sci-Fi buff's attention, but in a manner accessible to those who don't read Sci-Fi on a regular basis. Superb!<BR>	2004-02-07

The sequel to 'Alien Taste,' this is the second &quot;Ukiah Oregon&quot; book.<BR> <BR>A bit of background for this science fiction / mystery crossbreed: Ukiah Oregon was found wandering in the woods when he was a kid, a 'wolf boy' living feral. He was found by a lesbian couple who used humane traps to work with wolves, and they took him home, and began raising him as their own - after hiring a private eye to try and track down who he really was. The P.I. failed, Ukiah lived with the women as a son, and eventually, he and the P.I. started working together. In the first book, you find out a lot about Ukiah's strange origins, and start to realize just what he is up against.<BR> <BR>'Tainted Trail' picks up where 'Alien Taste' left off, in that Ukiah and his P.I. partner are seeking out a missing person, but the ancient evil alien race Ukiah went up against in the first book may be behind what's going on in the wild woods where his childhood friend went missing. <BR> <BR>Wen Spencer really upped the ante on this one - the hits land closer to Ukiah's core, the damage dealt is harsher, and the blood and guts got me a bit nauseated in parts. On the plus side (not that the above is necessarily a con), the supporting cast to this book is much more flushed out and interesting, and the mystery itself was complex enough to keep me reading. If you like your science fiction with a mystery twist, and like complex genetic plots, this is the series for you. I'm certainly ready for book three (though I might read something a tad less violent first). <BR> <BR>'Nathan	2004-02-04

Though I somehow just went a week without finishing any of the books I've been reading (thank you upcoming store inventory, *grumble*), I must say this little gem got me through some of the worst of it!  This book is just beautiful.<BR> <BR>It is, put far too simply, a collection of letters between an American lady of fabulous wit and sarcasm and a few people of Marks &amp; Co., a British bookstore on 84, Charing Cross Road.  The letters suck you right in - what Helen says, one cannot help but read, and the wonderfully phrased return letters from (mostly) Frank Doel always made me chuckle in a &quot;Gosh, I remember living in England,&quot; way.  This is a correspondance that covers two decades, and though I often felt like some of the letters were missing (there are replies to questions you never see asked), it was a delight to read this.<BR> <BR>It's rare I enjoy a nonfiction book that isn't on one of the narrow topics I enjoy, and biographical correspondance isn't normally something I pay attention to.  Still, this is fabulous, and I suggest you go grab a copy, a cuppa, and just enjoy!<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2004-02-02

Indeed, out of the full selection of twenty-seven short stories and one poem, two stories (and the poem) merit comment:<BR> <BR>'The Changeling Lover,' by Ian Young is a disturbing enough poem, about someone throwing themselves down into the grave of a dead lover, and holding their corpse to their body, etc. I was disturbed, so check, but it wasn't exactly bent.<BR> <BR>'T@ngled,' by Stuart Thorogood was damned disturbing, but for all that it worked in the gross-out/horror factor, it was basically a ghostly rape story, and as such, didn't exactly read like queer erotica so much as violence.<BR> <BR>'Touching Darkness,' by Patrick Roscoe was the one and only title I felt delivered. It reminded me a little of 'The Yellow Wallpaper' in that you're pretty sure a character is descending in insanity, and yet, you're not entirely sure which character is the one going crazy. The tale has enough queer content to be bent, and a dark and sombre plot-line that makes the check for sinister easy to fill in.<BR> <BR>Most of the stories, though, don't even read like stories. More like exerpts, in which a gay character is at best mentioned. What was disturbing about having a moonlit conversation with the ghost of King Arthur in 'Legend of Albion' by Graeme Woolaston? I have no idea. I couldn't even find the gay content in that one. And 'Famished' by Neil Bartlett was just sort of... well, dumb. Two hot gay guys who seem identical mention they're famished to an old guy who is swimming at a nudge beach. It scares him. The end. What?!<BR> <BR>So - to say the least, a disappointment. Skip this one.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2004-01-23

This isn't the first Neil Gaiman I've read, having also listened to the author himself read an unabridged version of 'Coraline,' and having read in print 'Good Omens.' I like his urban fantasy (dark usually) style quite a bit. <BR> <BR>This story follows Richard, a fella who lives a rather normal life in a rather normal part of London, and who, out with a girl you'd rather he not live a normal life with, bumps into a small young woman who basically falls at his feet, beaten and bloody. Richard, being the nice guy, picks her up and helps her recover.<BR> <BR>You know that adage about no good deed going unpunished? Woah.<BR> <BR>Richard ends up running from two demonic sorts, after the girl, into 'London Below,' with the added bonus of that place sucking his above-London life into some sort of void, where no one can remember him. Before he's done, he'll suffer, try to find the girl, suffer, try to rescue the girl, suffer, meet an angel, and suffer. And there's some suffering, too.<BR> <BR>As always, Neil Gaiman's villains, and his heroes, have a fantastic depth to them, and the other characters are shifty and confusing enough that you can't quite figure out anyone's motives. It's a great story to listen to - and even though it was abridged, the sound effects and reading voice really added a great deal of tone to the story. I'm a little bit tempted to go find this unabriged and/or in print.  The world itself is easy to slip into, deep and dark and just wonderfully full of shadowy danger.  <BR> <BR>I think I need to find more Gaiman, regardless.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2004-01-21

I first bumped into this author by listening to an abridged version of 'First Counsel,' which I think, to date, has been one of the best audiobook thriller experiences I've had.<BR>  <BR>This one comes a very close second, and only does so because I guessed a small part of the plot when the author dropped a clue - and I suppose even so, just because I was paying a lot of attention at that point, I noted it - so I'd figured out the mystery a bit.  Not where it ultimately went, but a part of it.<BR> <br />Here's the basic plot set-up:  Oliver works at a private bank, a big one, where the clients all need millions just to set up an account.  His family is deep into health-related hospital bills, and he needs cash in a big way.  When he and his brother realize that someone is about to rip off the bank in a big way, the temptation takes seed...<BR> <BR>See, in the U.S., after five years, an unattended account is transferred to the bank.  It's been five years, and no next-of-kin has been found for a fellow with three million in his account, and it's about to go to the government.  Then, at the last minute, someone steps in and sends a fax saying, \\"Hey, I'm kin.\\"  So Oliver is about to make the transfer when his brother notices the fax number is for the Kinko's next door.  Sure enough, they're being bilked...<BR> <BR>...so why not take the money themselves?  No one is getting hurt, right - the fella is dead, no next-of-kin ever turned up except for the fake one.  There's no way to get caught.  What could it hurt?<BR> <BR>And from there, the double-crosses, betrayals, and confusion escalates, and before long, they're not looking for those millions, they're looking for a way out alive.<BR> <BR>Tension jacks up at a nice pace, each tape seems carefully crafted to end you on a high note (a nice touch, and makes you flip over the tape in a manic way).  Very recommended.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2004-01-17

Alvin's apprenticeship is very interesting, but it is Peggy's story I'm really starting to enjoy more. Peggy is a torch - someone with the knack to see futures in the heartfires of folk, and her own future is intertwined with Alvin's. But when she sees that her own future is a loveless one if she waits for Alvin to arrive, she does the unthinkable - she runs away, to find a way to at least have love for Alvin, if not love from him. Her determination to thwart her own gifts of futuresight is a joy to read, and her strength of character - somewhat rare for female characters in a lot of fantasy works - is a nice change. Very enjoyable.<BR> <BR>So is where the tale ends, with a bit more magic than usual, and a set-up for the next story that I'm glad I didn't have to wait years for - like all the other folk who've been reading this series since book one.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2004-01-11

Now, granted, I listened to it abridged on four audiocassettes, but it just didn't... flow. <BR> <BR>Basically, the tale is thus: Ariel Behn, daughter of a really complex family structure, inherits something when her half-blood cousin (maybe) is killed, and that something might get her killed. So when her gypsy/german/rom/aryan/aboriginal/you-name-it various half-incest-inbred-orphan relatives come out of the woodwork to try and stop her / lie to her / mislead her / confuse her / rob her / seduce her, she's left confused.<BR> <BR>So is the reader. By the third time you find out that the people she thought were her grandparents aren't, or that her lover is actually the half-brother of her cousin's uncle, who raped his maid before forcing her to marry him... yadda yadda yadda. It gets old, fast. And the notion of the various texts and manuscripts that Ariel is researching that might lead to some astounding knowledge just don't get enough play-time. In \\"The Eight,\\" it was the pieces of the chess set, and the rich history, that was interesting. In \\"The Magic Circle,\\" it just didn't work, and the manuscripts are never quite explained at all.  The weaving between the past - set in 32 AD during the last week of the life of Christ, and the present - 1989, during the confusion of Gorbechev's Russia, don't mesh, mix, or really interconnect the way the various time periods did in \\"The Eight.\\"<BR> <BR>If you like multi-generational family (melo)dramas, it might be your thing, but for me, this just fell a little flat.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2004-01-04

This beautiful book was a gift from a bookcrossing friend for Yule, 2003. I intend to read this with my nephew, and niece, and someday bequeath it to them (likely when they're a little bit older and less likely to rampage a book). For now it'll be \\"that book Uncle 'Nathan brings and reads to us.\\"<BR> <BR>The story itself is beautifully illustrated and told with a light, spare sort of prose that leaves nearly everything to your imagination, and yet tells you just enough to give your imagination one huge shove in the right direction. <BR> <BR>Little Catkin is a gift from a wise woman to a family with only one daughter. The wise woman forsees a danger in the child's future, and Catkin is left as a protector. When his curiosity fails the child, Catkin has to go rescue her from the Little People, and his courage and wit is a delight to read.<BR> <BR>This was such a pretty story, and reminded me so vividly of Persephone/Demeter/Hades, and other classic mythology.

This is the second book in the 'Alvin Maker' series by Orson Scott Card, which began in &quot;Seventh Son.&quot; Alvin was prenticed off to a blacksmith, and at the start of this novel, he's on his way when he's ambushed by Reds and stolen away. <br />Card is writing a very alternate history of North America, with figures and places that match history, but always twisted just slightly. The Hio River, the Mizzipy, and so forth all make me trip up on my mental tongue sometimes (in fact, I would rather have had Ohio and Mississipi, as it was quite distracting). This world, however, has something different to it: magic, in all its forms, be they faith, nature, hexes, superstition, knacks, etc, all of it works. So when Alvin, the seventh son of a seventh son, shows the same ability to speak and wield the powers of the land like any Red (read: Natives), he is taken by Ta-Kumsaw, and woven into a story that threatens to be bigger than all of them - and likely a tale that will soak the ground with blood.<br />This second book has a lot more characters to it, and the story expands from the scope of just Alvin's point of view.  Be prepared to meet various historical figures in this tale, including Napolean and 'Ta-Kumsaw,' and references to many more like Andrew Jackson and Ben Franklin.  The drama of the story widens (and is much more cruel and bloody than the previous book, be forewarned).  <br />Very well done, but in places, as I said, the tendancy to use almost-right names and locations drove me nuts. I'll keep reading the series (and am looking forward to doing so), but I think I need a break from it.<br />'Nathan	2004-01-01

D&amp;D 3.5 has been a pleasant surprise, and the most pleasant surprise of all in the new system is the notion of Prestige Classes. Basically, they're uber-specialized classes that one has to qualify for in the more basic core classes (ie: Fighter, Paladin, Wizard, etc.)<BR> <BR>With an eye for the martial, this book goes through many different styles of character class. First, it introduces three new 'core' classes, levelled one to twenty. The three new classes include the Hexblade, a sort of warrior with a minor aside in curses, hexes, and other arcane bits of might, the Samurai, which are as you'd imagine, and the Swashbuckler - one class I know my group, who is fond of sailing-ship adventures, is likely to enjoy.<BR> <BR>This is followed by a variant Paladin and Ranger for low-magic campaigns. Then come the Martial Prestige classes - which include such greats as the Tattooed Monk, the Hunter of the Dead, and the classic elven Bladesinger.<BR> <br />This was one of the more worthier books in 3.5 that I've bought, and even if my players don't avail themselves of the classes, the option of these classes and prestige classes definitely adds to a DM's repetoire of martial-focused villains and support NPCs.

I waited a very long time for this book, and I must say it was worthy of the wait. S.D. Perry began the relaunch of DS9 with the &quot;Avatar&quot; duet, and since then, I've been avidly watching the series unfold.<BR> <BR>First off, the book captured the ensemble feel of the show excellently - the main characters - including the new characters written into the storyline to replace characters gone or lost at the show's end - all shine in their own way with their own interesting stories. The new plot-arc of the invading parasitic aliens - as we've seen on screen in TNG, and read about in the superb &quot;Lives of Dax,&quot; short story collection - continues with a great deal of suspense and solid prose work.<BR> <BR>Best of all, the internal minds and emotional states of the characters are both valid and consistant. Shar, especially, gets a lot of work in this book, as does Lieutenant Ro, who is definitely at a loss as to what she should choose, now that Bajor might merge with the Federation and her job would become a Starfleet one.<BR> <BR>Granted, the purchase of a Star Trek hardcover often makes me flinch (it's quite expensive), but this one was worth it - even if I did tear through it in a single evening.<BR> <BR>The only part of the book I have a caveat for is the 'Benny' storyline - I never quite liked Sisko's insane asylum plotline in the series, and having Elias Vaughn go through something similar grated on me a little - though, if you enjoyed the various visions Sisko had at the hands of the prophets in the show, you'll likely enjoy this also.<BR> <BR>Very well done.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2003-12-10

The plot is well crafted, and two fold.  One, in the present, is the ongoing investigative story of Zak Kebron's murder investigation of who might be behind Lieutenant Commander Gleau.  With solid characterization of both M'Ress and Arex, and more from Kat Meuller (a character I'm really starting to enjoy), this half of the plot has a good pace and a very interesting unfolding story to it.<BR> <BR>The B-plot is in the past, and tells the story of Mackenzie Calhoun meeting Elizabeth Shelby and what exactly happened between them the first time they met, fell in love - and how they fell out of it, and how all of that might just very well play a significant role in the murder investigation that will take place years later.<BR> <BR>Done well, and with a bit of a reprieve from the over-the-top humour that has been getting so out of hand lately, this 'episode' in the New Frontier has restored a bit of my faith in where David is taking these characters.<BR> <BR>What I can say I didn't approve of is the formatting in hardcover - if I didn't have an employee discount at the bookstore where I work, I wouldn't have bought it.  And, judging from the feedback of the various trek fans who've passed comments about the book so far, they're not buying it in hardcover, they'll wait for paperback.

Argh!<BR> <BR>Okay, before I dissolve into abject frustration, I'll begin with saying that this book was leagues above 'Return of the Damned.' The writing style returns to Lain's previous decent level, and the plot is a bit more involved. There is no mystery here - you are in on the bad guy's every thought and plan, but the villainy is quite well orchestrated: Bad Wizard uses Shield Golem to kill off young rivals to the soon-to-marry Duke's daughter. <BR> <BR>But when the Duke's daughter decides that our intrepid Regdar is more to her liking than any other possible suitor, and the Duke grants a title to Regdar to make him a potential suitor (as he's currently a commoner without that title). Enter Naull, Regdar's girlfriend, and somewhat jealous of this unfolding situation, and huzzah - the set up for plot is complete.<BR> <BR>Indeed, it unfolds quite well, with Lain's typical one-liners and cute humour all about. As usual, however, you can measure the half-life of a non-Iconic character with a pocket ruler. And the villain is a bit dim near the end in his choice of confrontations. But, this is D&D fiction, not grand literature, and it was enjoyable.<BR> <BR>The ending, however, brings me back to that 'Argh!' I mentioned. Consider yourself warned that you'll likely find the ending extremely frustrating. Not in a badly-written way - oh no, it wasn't a cop-out ending, or a rushed ending. I'm quite sure Lain wrote this on purpose. But gosh, I could have screamed when I got there.<BR> <BR>Very well done. And that 'Argh!' is also the sound of someone who is certainly going to buy the next one, just to see what happens next.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2003-11-30

I tend to avoid short story collections, as short story collections tend to vary in quality; but this is a collection of short stories set in the Star Trek: New Frontier series that was crafted by Peter David, and since he was the editor, I gave it a shot.  Lately, as another reviewer has mentioned, I have been frustrated with where the series is going (too heavy handed, too humerous in a blunt way), but these stories were a complete change of pace, and in a very good way.  They are reminiscent of the DS9 relaunch, where various authors have obviously been given an outline to follow, but granted creative expression.<BR> <BR>The stories take turns with the various characters of the New Frontier cast, and as such, I found some of them quite interesting (Shelby switching from engineering to command track, a diary-entry story featuring Lefler, a really solid bit of character study for McHenry), but others, based on characters I couldn't really care all that much for (Kebron, Si Cwan), just didn't do much for me. <BR> <BR>However, a few of the stories blew me away.  Most notably, the one about Morgan Primus (Robin Lefler's immortal mother), was done with such a deft touch of emotionality that I actually got choked up, which is rare enough with Star Trek in general, but very rare in short story Trek fiction.  I honestly place it on a level with the TNG episode \\"The Inner Light.\\"  Yes, that good.  I, too, will be seeking more stories from Ilsa J. Bick.<BR> <BR>Which brings me around to the good part about short story collections - that you often meet a new author worthy of more research and reading.

I had quite high hopes for this, or at least, high hopes in the realm of D&amp;D writing.  See, way back in the very first book in this series, Lain introduced Regdar and Naull, the Iconic characters from the D&amp;D re-release, as slowly developing a love.  In &quot;The City of Fire,&quot; Naull and Regdar's love is developed, and at the end, Naull chooses a terrible self-sacrifice, leaving Regdar alone, but saving the world.  In this story, there's a chance - a small chance - that Naull might actually be alive!<BR> <BR>So, of course, Regdar hooks up with those he can find to try and save her...<BR> <BR>...and goes on a very pointless hack and slash, fight after fight plot with little to no cohesion and a senseless sort of &quot;keep fighting, one bad thing a chapter&quot; style that left me cold.  The big climax wasn't as climactic as it needed to be, and to be honest, it was the worst in the series so far.  <BR> <BR>It's unfortunate, because this was the sub-plot I was really enjoying (well, barring my hopeful, but never gonna happen,  love interest between Hennet and Kerwyn).  I can only hope the next title, &quot;The Death Ray,&quot; brings Regdar and Naull (and all the rest) back into play as a more plot-driven enjoyable story.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2003-11-24

In the first two books, \\"Hominids,\\" and \\"Humans,\\" Sawyer deftly described the 'alien' in the form of the Neanderthals in such a way as to show us our own failures as human beings, but at the same time, with such a light touch that it did not come across as preachy. If you haven't read those two, then stop now, head on over, and pick up \\"Hominids,\\" first.<BR> <BR>The story in the first two books introduced us to a wide range of neanderthal and human characters, living on parallel earths, and rudely made aware of each other when a single neanderthal, Ponter, falls through into our earth.  In the second tome, relations are opened between the world, and a Synergy Group formed.  Ponter's relationship with a human woman, Mary Vaughn, grew toward love, and the differences between their two cultures began to show the startling way in which humans have really failed. Indeed, in this book, one of the characters, Jock, begins to see just how poorly humans have handled their world.<BR> <BR>There is much to this book that is easily missed - Sawyer has put gender issues, sexuality issues, racism, violence, criminal systems, enviromental practices - all of it is on display in this series, and in the third book, it is in the character of Mary that we get to explore both worlds with her biased human eye.<BR> <BR>As the collapse of our Earth's magnetic field continues (it flips now and then, and is doing so now), Jock, Mary, and the rest of the Synergy group are slowly realizing what it could possibly mean to humanity, while at the same time Mary explores options of potentially creating a hybrid child with Ponter, the neanderthal she has fallen in love with.<BR> <BR>Most interesting to me (as a gay reader) was Mary's intellectual and emotional wrestling with the Neanderthal relationship structure (they each have a man-mate and a woman-mate, and live in same-gendered relationships for most of their lives, with about four days a month spent in opposite-gender relationships). As Mary moves towards adopting the Neanderthal way of life, she slowly allows herself to consider the option of a woman-mate, and the eventual outcome of her thoughts and feelings really struck me.<BR> <BR>Just as interesting was the religious debate that has been ongoing in this series. The Neanderthals, very uncurious and entirely unreligious, are shown to be lacking whatever brain components are required for 'faith.' When Mary and Ponter decide to have a child, the Catholic Mary needs to figure out if her child should have the gene for faith, or not. It's an amazingly good thought process for both of them, and again I tip my hat at Sawyer.<BR> <BR>Where the story finally goes took me by surprise, and left me satisfied about the trilogy at large. This was superb, and as always, I wait for Sawyer's next great novel.  There's a reason he's one of only sixteen people to have both a Hugo and a Nebula for best novel, folks.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2003-10-09

The latest installment in Peter David's &quot;New Frontier&quot; series got a little out of hand in its plot, but was ultimately enjoyable.<BR> <BR>When we last saw the crew (or, I should say, 'crews,' since Shelby's crew on the Trident is now just as much a part of the plot as Calhoun's on the Excalibur), they were getting beaten to a pulp by the ancient gods of historical earth, and we'd learned that Mark McHenry had, in his ancestry, one of those gods - Apollo. In the episode of the original series with Apollo, he took a lady lieutenant aside, and apparently, they conceived, which ultimately led to Mark and his odd abilities. <BR> <BR>Since Mark told Calhoun not to trust the gods (including Artemis, his childhood friend and adolescent lover), the gods smacked the Excalibur to heck and back, killing eight crewmembers, including Robin Lefler's apparently not-so-immortal mother, and leaving McHenry in a strange dead-but-not-decaying state. <BR> <BR>And that's just the set up at the start of this novel. Si Cwan is back on Danter, trying to rekindle the Thallonian empire (but one of the gods is also on Danter, handing out ambrosia, and things get awkward, fast). The role of the gods, ambrosia, and the effect it is having on the quadrant is the main plot of the story, and done interestingly, if a tad over the top, and of course, the McHenry story (like he'd really be totally dead). Ditto Robin's mother.<BR> <BR>The 'B' plot is the continuing story arc on the Trident of Lieutenant M'Ress, Lieutenant Commander Gleau, and Lieutenant Commander Arex - a twisted little love and hate and potential murder triangle that leaves one a little confused at best. Kat Meuller, Shelby's XO, gets quite a bit of attention in this book, and it's a good thing, but Peter David's tendancy to make everyone lust after the wrong person is starting to get a tad trite.<BR> <BR>I was looking forward to this book, so I think I was a little let down by holding it up a little high in my expectations.It has some great one-liners (a David trademark), and the plot advances in some significant ways, so I cannot complain overmuch. It was good enough, just a little heavy on the coincidence.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2003-10-04

It was four tapes long, so I imagine not a whole lot was left out, and D.B. Sweeney's voice was superb! He really has a talent for accents and voices that don't come across as stereotypes or silly.<BR> <BR>The story itself is a solid one, a political/law thriller, with Michael Garrick being the protagonist of the tale. Michael begins dating a gal named Nora Hartson, which seems a simple enough set-up, but Nora is the daughter of the president. Code-named 'Shadow' by her secret service, the date goes wrong from the moment Michael lets her drive, and she loses her security tail. They go to a bar - which turns out to be a gay bar - and there they see Michael's married boss meeting with someone. She is anxious to follow, and Michael and Nora find that Michael's boss leaves a package in the woods. When they open it, it seems Michael's boss is delivering forty thousand dollars... to someone.<BR> <BR>From there, the story picks up the pace, and the tension is raised, bit by bit, as more and more of Michael's attempts to figure things out lead him straight to the role of a fall-guy. Can he trust anyone he knows? Can he even trust the girl he is falling in love with? You'll have to listen to find out, but as the story twists from blackmail, to murder, to conspiracy, you'll not be let down by the plot - it's very well handled.<BR> <BR>I'll be finding more from Meltzer.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2003-09-29

Imagine a family whose past begain in the birth of 'gifts.' To this one family line, the women are all given a gift on their thirteenth birthday. When she was young, Jenny Sparrow found herself able to dream the dreams of others, and suffered under a bad relationship with a mother whose gift was to immediately tell who is lying.<BR> <BR>Jenny ran away with the wrong type of boy, and it is soon the time for her own daughter to turn thirteen. And Stella, her daughter, gets a the most terrible gift of all: she sees the future - but specifically, how people will die.<BR> <BR>When Stella tries to prevent a murder, and her father - who acted in her stead - is the one accused of the crime, Jenny has no choice but to send her daughter to live with her mother. There, Jenny and her cancer-ridden grandmother Elinor learn a lot about fate, death, and just what it means to be alive. Events conspire to force Jenny, and her husband, to return to the city they ran away from, and before long, passions and gifts are intertwining.<BR> <BR>With typical Hoffman elegance to the prose and emotionality of the characters, 'The Probable Future' was an absolute joy to read. I am a huge fan of Hoffman to begin with, but this one is on par with 'The Blue Diary' and 'Practical Magic', two of Hoffman's best. I read it in one extended setting (with bothersome interruptions of meals and work), and cannot wait to pass this along to another Hoffman fan.<BR> <BR>If you've never read Hoffman, you simply must read her for her elegant style, her immediacy in writing in the present tense, and her beautiful use of power, magic, and folklore in the evocation of characters.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2003-09-18

When she grows far more attached than professional, she enlists the aid of her detective father, Peter Decker, to try to figure out where the baby came from, and who the mother was. When the answer is unsettling, Cindy delves deeper. Each new wrinkle in the case seems meaner and darker than before, and soon Cindy is a target, something she is all too recently familiar with - for Cindy is a rape survivor.<BR> <BR>Kellerman kept these characters very plausible, emotionally speaking, and I quite enjoyed the first-person narrative of Cindy Decker. Where I lost a bit of steam was the often abrupt slip into third person that occurred whenever the spotlight was on her father, Peter, or other players in the story. Their emotional baggage with each other (far more loaded than most fathers and daughters) is well written, and the tension really aids in jacking up the pace of the story.<BR> <BR>The two sub-plots are also wisely written and interesting: First, Peter's wife, and orthodox Jew, is looking into the past of her mother (and her grandmother's murder), in the dark history of Hitler's Germany, to very intruiging results. And second, Cindy has a developing relationship with (also Jewish) Ethiopian black Koby, which shows some pretty edgy takes on bias and racism, as well as some quite steamy passages of passion between the two.<BR> <BR>All in all, very satisfying in and of itself (and even to someone who has not read Kellerman before), but I must admit, my appetite is whetted for Kellerman now.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2003-09-08

First off, if you've never read any of the J.D. Robb series, you're missing out, and shouldn't start here, but with 'Naked in Death' the first in the series.<BR> <BR>Eve Dallas is a tough detective in an even tougher future New York. In 'Imitation in Death,' the latest serial killer is imitating the serial killers of history, and has left notes for Dallas - all but taunting her inability to make it stop. While Dallas does her usual hard-ass investigation, the list of suspects quickly fills itself - with important and influential individuals. She certainly can't afford to mess this one up.<BR> <BR>With help from her sexy-to-the-\\"ult\\" husband Roarke (no other name) and her relationship-jittery aide Delia Peabody, Eve tries to hunt down the baddie with her usual zest and sarcasm. Her bafflement with all things feminine and family continues, and the sub-plot of Eve's slowly uncovering amnesia/repression about her family gets a little further in this book - with some startling results. <BR> <BR>Even better, the secondary characters we all know and love - Peabody especially, taking her Detective's test - all get a bit of book-time in 'Imitation in Death.' They grow, change, and interact with the sassy style you're used to from Robb, and with awesome results.<BR> <BR>You'll find it ult. Icy, even. But definitely murder.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2003-08-31

This book made me very very angry - even when I enjoyed it.<BR> <BR>Here's the thing: Someone is killing patients at Boston Memorial, and the reasons are confusing - but two people are close to realizing that something is going on, so the killer must act. One, Cassi Kingsley, is a former pathology resident who has switched to psychiatry, and the other is her friend Robert, who is still in pathology. They've noticed a pattern in deaths that don't have proper explanations. Cassi's husband, Thomas, is a superstar of the cardiology ward, and a surgeon of top class - he wants her to stop, as if these deaths have a medical reason, it will bring down the hospital.  And the murderer wants these investigations to stop as well, for obvious reasons.<BR> <BR>Sounds neat, right? Well, it is. Except that the book was written in the 80s, and here's the 'getting mad' part.<BR> <BR>Thomas is annoyed that Cassi is associating with a 'known homosexual' like Robert. Other homosexuals in the book are likened to AIDS as a sort of causal result of their lifestyle (this from a doctor, *sigh*). Oh, and when Cassi starts to wonder about her husband's sanity, everyone tells her to calm down, stand by her man, etc. She also constantly thinks things like, \\"If my husband left me, my life would fall apart! What would I do?!\\" He's emotionally abusive, and she takes it as if it is her due. Sexism is rampant throughout the book, Cassi has all the resolve of a wet noodle, never trusts herself without her husband's opinion, won't schedule necessary eye surgery because her husband hasn't chatted it over with her yet, and dear criminy I'll stop now, before I blow a vein or something. Urk.<BR> <BR>Honestly, in its day I'll bet this was quite the reading experience, but in today's standards, Cassi reads terribly.  It's painful to watch her, frustrating to see her unable to help herself, and the attitudes of most of the hospital make you want to punch something.  Certainly, this thriller kept my pulse racing, but mostly in anger.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2003-08-31

The second wonderful David Stukas humour-mystery series about two gay men and a lesbian, this one was just as much campy, snarky fun!<BR> <BR>Very much in the style of the first book, 'Someone Killed His Boyfriend,' the fun in this book is certainly not in taking it seriously, but in revelling in the characterizations of the trio: Strong-Like-Dumptruck (and Smart-Like-Dumptruck) Michael, Gosh-Darned-Naive Robert, and the towering Amazon (and mystery novel loving) Monette.<BR> <BR>Monette is stealing my heart as the best literary fun lesbian ever written (At one point, she's got it all figured out, but won't tell anyone because there's a storm front moving in and she wants to gather all the possible individuals around a dinner table and announce the killer that way - just like in mystery books! You gotta love it). <BR> <BR>This time, Robert, the ne'er love well voice from the first novel, gets a chance at a gosh-darned real relationshp: a rich and wonderful German Count seems to fall for him, hard, and whisks him away from life, work, and other dreary events.  It's the lap of luxury, with a possessive German Count that loves him with a fiery passion (and leather and other costume accoutrements), and it all seems too good to be true.  The count seems willing to do anything for Robert... And gets killed.<BR> <BR>Robert is left as suspect number one in the murder.  Alas, his rich Count might have had a few skelletons (or at least rubber priest outfits and riding saddles) in his closet, and obviously, one of them is worth killing him over... So what's a gay man like Robert Wislop to do in a fabulous German Palace, dead lover growing cold, and suspician growing hotter? Call in his lesbian friend Monette to figure it out (and hope that his imfamous gay friend Michael doesn't end up sleeping with every policeman who is supposed to be finding the real killer)...<BR> <BR>These are a blast, and there's a new one on the way!

It took me quite a while, as it was a bath-tub book and 751 pages long.

But who can she really trust, and is her disorder natural, or somehow is she being manipulated?  When bodies start to appear, and both Martie and her husband Dusty begin to show signs of being 'programmed,' it seems like everything in thier lives has been created to fulfill some sort of sick game - can they possibly escape, and bring the one behind it to justice?<BR> <BR>The characters in this book really stole the show from the villain, which is fine (I despised the villain - the character, not the writing thereof - which is always a good sign of a thriller done well)...	2003-08-06

Toss in a suprise visit from his Girlfriend, three holy knights with very holy swords (one of whom has a very bitter wife), and you see why Harry's day is just about as bad as any he's had.<BR> <BR>The mystery in this one threw me for a loop (I thought I had it right, only to learn I had it way wrong), and the tone of the book was dark and fun in equal measure.

First off, Jan Maxwell reads the plot wonderfully, with the right emphasis and just enough emotionality to lend it credulity.

It starts with scuffles, and vandalism, but is soon a rising tide of murderous rage.

With most medical thriller authors, after two or three you start to see the pattern, find the baddie, and close the book with a vague sigh. Even listening to abridged audios of her work, I never quite guess the villain until it's nearly too late for the heroine!<BR> <BR>The only misgivings I have about this one is the romantic attachment that Claire finds feels a bit forced - likely a result of the abridgement, however, as I'm sure there are scenes missing that would have laid more of a foundation in their relationship.<BR> <BR>All in all, a really enjoyable listening experience.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2003-07-29

Ditto for Hennet, who is stinging somewhat over the parting of ways with Ember from a previous title. It's nice to see the plot unfolding over many titles, though there are some discrepancies, as noted by one other reviewer: (a) Hennet never uses Invisibility, which would have come in handy a few times, and (b) where's the wand he won in the competition?  Y'know, the one that reflects magic back?  Even mentioning that it had been used up would have been nice.

Basically, in this tale, a 3 year old boy survived a plane crash, and lived in the wild for very many years. He is found when some hunters accidentally 'trap' him with one of those cruel and terrible beartraps, and taken to mental institution, where he is slated to be locked away.<BR> <BR>The sister of one of the psychiatrists goes to visit him for advice, and sees this 'wolfman' and - on random impulse and affected by something the wolfman says - takes him home.<BR> <BR>This is the spark to the story - what sets everything else in motion, a trick that Hoffman has down pat. From there, everyone in the book has their lives ricochet off from this one event, and as always, Hoffman delivers wonderful metaphors, allegories and pathetic fallacy to an almost magical level. It's a beautiful piece of prose to read (or listen to).<BR> <BR>Though I didn't quite find it as wonderful as 'Local Girls,' 'Practical Magic,' 'The Blue Diary,' or 'The River King.'

Bernardo is entering a monastary to become a monk, and the plan for revenge begins.

Juan Ramon can sense the attraction Bernardo has for him, and slowly realizes his own feelings for Bernardo are growing to be more than usery, but with so much blood on everyone's hands, is the innocent Bernardo doomed?  Written with some deep theological internal debate in Bernardo's voice, and even darker violent anger in Juan Ramon's, the libidinous charge that saturates this novel is just nail-biting.  Ultimately, where the end of the novel goes is a sharp shock, and the characters are definitely true to themselves, though not in a way you might think.  Good for fans of thrillers of any sort, but definitely a solid choice for fans of the gay genre written at its most sensual.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2003-07-05

I enjoyed \\"The Harvest\\" as an abridged audiocasette.<BR> <BR>The tension is quite well crafted: simmering low at first, and then rising to a boil, and the tale is strong, with characters that begin quite disparate, but weave toward each other with edgy craftiness.  By the end of the first tape, you're ready to give up on sleep to keep listening.<BR> <BR>When a young resident heart surgeon steps into what might just be a \\"purchased organ transplant\\" fraud, and chooses to send a heart to a young boy instead of a rich man's wife, things start to go bad for her. Soon, she has lawsuits against her, and then even more career-ruining events that might not just end her career, but potentially her freedom - or her life.<BR> <BR>Dodging bullets, accusations, career-wrecking lawsuits and worse, Abby DiMatteo struggles even to keep her life while still fighting to find more evidence, before she's buried with the rest of the information.<BR> <BR>There were a few weak moments - and the ending was very sudden, which is likely an effect of the story being abridged. Though the story was wrapped up, I think I just needed a few more bits of conversation out of Abby. Ah well. <BR> <BR>Read by Jayne Brooke with aplomb, (Dr. Diane Grad on \\"Chicago Hope,\\" which I doubt is a coincidence), the tale is wonderfully performed, which always has the power to make or break a tale. <BR> <BR>'Nathan	2003-07-05

The main storyline is one of a Borg virus that seems to be spreading at will throughout Earth, and Voyager and her crew, having recently returned from one heck of a battle with the Borg, are dead centre in the suspicion category.<BR> <BR>In the first book of this duet, I was a little worried about the Doctor's sub-plot: a holo-revolution, and found Torres' story about trying to find out if her mother is really dead or not to be quite interesting.<BR> <BR>This time, the effects of the sub-plots on me reversed.<BR> <BR>The conclusion of the Torres storyline had an ending that really really frustrated me, but the holo-strike/revolution, which I thought was going to be such a dud, actually had a decent recovery (and some interesting side-characters, including one hunk of a security officer who was described in perfect detail to make me wish I could beam on over). Ahem. Where was I?<BR> <BR>The main story, the borg-virus plotline, I found quite well done.  The characterizations were really &quot;on&quot; in this one - no one felt out of character, or forced. And the very ending of the story leads me to believe that we are going to see more of the &quot;post-show&quot; Voyager in the same way we saw it in the DS9 relaunch. I hope so, anyway, as I'd like to see Chakotay in his new position, and really enjoyed the inclusion of the trill doctor.  All in all, a decent effort.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2003-07-05

Decent star-trek fare, this picks up the tale of what happened to the Voyager Crew once they returned to the Alpha Quadrant.<BR> <BR>The sub-plots are variable in quality and interest. B'Elanna's story sounds wonderful, and I'm looking forward to it's conclusion: her mother left on a pilgrimmage, and never returned, but left a letter for B'Elanna that mentions the vision that B'Elanna had of the Barge of the Dead. Is her mother still alive?  Torres is off to find out, even though her child is only weeks old.<BR> <BR>The Doctor's story, however, is overdone. A human working with the former EMH's on that mining moon decides to throw a holographic rebellion. Urk.<BR> <BR>The major plot arc, however, is that there's some sort of Borg virus - random people on Earth are slowly borgifying, and Starfleet seems to be blaming the Voyager crew... or at least one Admiral is, and the person who Starfleet Intelligence puts in charge of investigating is very close to one of the Voyager crew - and living a lie.<BR>  <BR>Golden does seem to have a solid grasp on the characters involved in the show and storyline, which is always a positive thing when reading Trek fiction.

This was quite good - and the reading voice of Megan Gallagher certainly did it justice. The storyline is pretty straightforward at first: a bug electronics expert, Niema Burdock, loses her husband on assignment as a field agent specialist during a mission that goes horribly wrong. <BR> <BR>Now, much later, the man in charge of the mission which killed her husband needs her again - to plant a bug into the home of an arms dealer who has a new explosive on the market that can go undiscovered until the target exploded, a sort of stealth explosive.<BR> <BR>So, partnered with this man, whom she suddenly feels a terrible attraction to, Niema goes undercover, and finds the man she is trying to bug just as interesting (and with more secrets, and sides, than she had thought).<BR> <BR>The entanglements get more and more twisted, and Gallagher lends enough of her voice to the performance that the tension moves upward at a solid pace.<BR> <BR>The frenetic pace sure didn't slack off in the last tape, and the story didn't quite end where I thought it would. Well done on all fronts - though some day I want to learn the secret of these heros from romance novels: How does a man fight a bodyguard, cold-clock a guy unconscious, run for an hour, hotwire a car, drive all night, and sometime the next afternoon proceed to win a gold medal in the lovemaking competition on a yacht, all, of course, with no sleep?<BR> <BR>Better yet, where can I find me a man like that?<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2003-07-05

This was fairly decent. I'm not a huge fan of legal thrillers - I've only read one or two Grishams, and never before read Levine, but the storyline was a bit interesting and, to me at least, fresh in the choices of characters. A former stripper/bad girl, Lisa was rescued by Max, who supported her through law school and has just called Lisa in on a very big favour.<BR> <BR>He's placing her with a Supreme Court Justice, and he wants her to sway his vote on an airline case in regards to a terrorist-related crash. But as Lisa learns more of just who Max is - and what he's done - and the case seems more and more of a conspiracy to hide the Airline's lies, she feels herself swaying in her loyalty, not to mention falling for the Justice in the first place.<BR> <BR>This romantic angle between Lisa and the Supreme Court Justice that seemed a little forced on the abridged audio version - they fall into bed and love at about the same time, which is somewhat abrupt, and I was somewhat surprised at the time. Still, for thrills, this delivered - there's chases, gunfights, and everything one expects from a rough and tumble legal thriller with edge.  Especially in audiobook format (and read well by Bamman), this was enjoyable.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2003-07-05

They all have a reason: Tordek wants to avenge a wrong against the Dwarven people, Vadania wants to stop the foul forge's sludge from ruining the forest, Devis wants a heroic story, and Lidda ... wants cash.<BR> <BR>But! As the story progresses, there's actual character development, especially with Devis (who we've not really seen in a while, and whose serious side gets a bit of brief attention). Tordek's history is explained, and I liked it. <BR> <BR>The cohesiveness of Lain's world is a bit off sometimes, and the way that \\"evil creatures of the week\\" seem to gang up on the heroes is sometimes a bit amiss, but this had some strength to it.

I hope that this is a first book in a series, as there's a lot of good groundwork here, and a heck of a lot expository prose that would be entirely wasted if it wasn't a set up for more to come.<BR> <BR>John Taylor (no relation to the singer) is a detective in London, who escaped \\"the Nightside\\" five years ago. What's the Nightside? Think Twighlight Zone, or Outer Limits, but add in a heavier dash of macabre, evil, shadow, whatever you'd like to pull from your worst nightmares and darkest impulses.<BR> <BR>It is a place that is not really in the world, but sort of beside it, buried in the heart of London, where all manner of dark and horrible things await - and where John Taylor is going with his new client, to rescue her child from something truly evil.<BR> <BR>In the Nightside, John can find anything - it's one of his many psychic gifts (that only function in the Nightside), and people fear him (although why he isn't sure, though he's pretty sure it has something to do with his mother, whom he doesn't really know, and about whom he's even less enlightened). <BR> <BR>This was good.

I was originally a little bit nervous to purchase this in hardcover, as the last few Anita Blake novels have really let me down.  So, I approached reading this book with trepidation.  So, first off - I liked it much better than Narcissus in Chains, which beat even Bloody Bones for the not-so-coveted \\"worst Anita Blake novel ever\\" award. <BR> <BR>Cerulean has an actual murder mystery that runs alongside Hamilton's continuing (and confusing) vampire politics plot that hasn't slowed down in ages (and in my opinion needs a serious breather). The RPIT return, Larry is mentioned (where did he go for so long?), and gosh, we even have Anita in the thick of said investigation, helping solve it. Who'd've thunk? It was good to see the same sort of book I'd loved near the beginning of the tale.<BR> <BR>That was the good stuff.<BR> <BR>The bad stuff is the continuing use of ardeur to make Anita sleep with everyone and everything that moves, including public metaphysical sex to a large audience of Musette/Belle Morte vampire contingency, and her having threesomes and so forth. This is getting old, fast.<BR> <BR>All that said, the side-characters got a lot more interesting in this tale, Richard had a turning point (and it's not further into Idiot/Moron/Angry/Jerk territory), and I'm very curious to see where Hamilton is taking Dolph. We'll see. It seems like Blake is back on the upswing, and that's a very good thing.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2003-06-24

I'm not a fan of the gun-slinging storyline, and as such it might have been more impactful for someone else.<BR> <BR>Basically, the story is this: a lawyer researching the death of an individual finds a Thebes State Penal Farm (Colored) in the MIssissipi of '51.

It's gorey, it's mean, it's full of 50's racist slang, and it's a difficult read if you abhor violence. <BR> <BR>Still, there were characters very richly described, and I must admit, I was happy when some of the key evil folk got splattered.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2003-06-24

I'm quite impressed with Charisma Carpenter's ability to capture the cadence and tones of nearly all the characters, with the exception of the absolute slaughter she has done of Giles' British Accent, and her sometimes mispronounced words (then again, I could be wrong, I was raised British and the difference between British English and American English is quite vast at times).<BR> <BR>The story is pretty neat, and given a sub-plot of Buffy's mom being really ill in what would be around 3rd Season in the show, it's a nice foreshadow to the eventual plot conclusion of Joyce's character from the series.  The notion of an immortal vampire who keeps popping into a new vampire body when her previous one is dusted is pretty nifty.  The ritual and the villains Veronique (this immortal vampire) is trying to conjure are quite well crafted.  Done well, overall!<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2003-06-24

I have been, and always will be an Alice Hoffman fan, from the moment I read \\"Practical Magic,\\" and then moved on to \\"Local Girls,\\" and just kept going.<BR> <BR>I adored this. One day a truly respected man, Ethan Ford, does not go to work.  He is arrested for a fifteen year old murder, and this is the tale of what happens thereafter.  It's Hoffman's wonderfully rich descriptive thematic analogies that snare you - when Hoffman describes lillies, they're not lillies, they're pathetic fallacy in motion. The characters were beautiful, with the incredibly interwoven lives that she is known for creating in most of her works. And the use of present tense in her prose always grinds me to a sense of immediacy.<BR> <BR>The rare first-person perspective from one character sometimes made me stumble (she was light years ahead of the maturity I've encountered in most adults), but the raw emotions of all the people involved was enough to pick me back up again. The only thing I did hiccough on was Ethan Ford himself - at the start one gets the impression that there will be a bit more to his particular story, but he doesn't really develop much - this is a tale about those he has affected, and how they ricochet off each other once his secret is out. I suppose I was lulled that his acts and past were going to be a moral conundrum, but I found I never gained even a bit of respect for him, nor any empathy for his plight. I merely wanted him to suffer.<BR> <BR>Turns out I'm not so forgiving a person after all - but I don't think that detracted from the story in and of itself, which is so very much more about the rest of the characters than Ethan himself.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2003-06-16

But, in true murder-mystery fashion, her pal's place becomes a murder scene, and soon Bailey is as hip deep in secrets and danger as she'd like to have been in herbal massage oils.  The characters are rich, and the mystery plot itself is full enough of red-herrings and dead-ends to make it a confounding puzzle that one enjoys unscrambling.<BR> <BR>With a steamy potential romance as a side-plot, the story has a solid momentum, and I didn't pick the right bad-person any sooner than Bailey did, which is always a plus. Better, characters from previous books (her love interest, her boss, her wonderful neighbour) are still on the scene, and growing.  This isn't deep thought provoking stuff, it's fun and enjoyable mystery - I'll definitely keep my eye out for Kate White again.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2003-06-16

Normally, when I read gay fiction, I get frustrated by the plethora of perfect-looking single men with adequately successful lives bemoaning the tiny imperfections that plague them. When a perfectly built jock-stud with a long string of one-night-stands suddenly wakes up one day and says, \\"Gosh, I wish I had a true love,\\" I have a hard time gathering much empathy.<BR> <BR>This isn't one of those stories.<BR> <BR>Here's the deal. Moderately-successful Hand-model Clu Latimore lives on Christopher street in Manhattan with his eight-year-long lover Chris, the Latin teacher. Though Clu has a lot of internal monologue about how he can't figure out why Chris, such an attractive man, is still with him, they're a good, solid couple.<BR> <BR>Clu gets called howe - to Grit, Texas - when his mother's impending death to cancer looms. And though the plot from there really shines with a lot of really odd bits and pieces (a tex-mex musical version of Agamemnon, a pack of breeding Chihuahuas, his brother digging for buried treasure, his sister's umpteenth attempt at being pregnant, and a country that just screams hick and angry), it's the characters that keep this one going.<BR> <BR>Clu is alternately enjoyable and frustrating. Anyone with emotional baggage from their family can easily empathise with the guy's situation, but you want to smack him over the head every time he takes a well-meaning comment someone else made and turns it into an impromptu \\"This is why what you said is homophobic\\" seminar. Clu's relationship with Chris takes a path I really didn't expect, and there's a betrayal that made me ill, but - let's face it - read quite true. <BR> <BR>I guess the word \\"plausible\\" doesn't sound like it should belong in a tale that includes a tex-mex musical Agamemmnon, but honestly, I can't find a better word to describe the characters nor the emotional reactions.

When I read \\"He's the One,\\" by Timothy James Beck, there was a character introduced that I was dying to learn more about: Daniel Stephenson. He had a realistic past, I identified with him a lot more than the main protagonist of \\"He's the One,\\" and moreover, he was just a wonderfully developed secondary character with some great stuff in his written past.<BR> <BR>Now I know why.<BR> <BR>Turns out that \\"It Had to be You,\\" is the story of Daniel Stephenson, getting up to just about the point where he's in in \\"He's the One.\\" This was great, even if I did already know the ending as I'd read them out of order. Daniel is an easy-to-identify-with character for me (no buff jock, just a slim guy; no massively successful job, just an entry level second-attempt-at-a-career). He's still hurt over the betrayal of his last boyfriend, still a little damaged over the revelation that yet another friend is slowly dying of AIDS, and just about ripe for falling head over heels with the hunky guy across the street.  Basically, he's a knight in slightly tarnished and dented armor (or at least a sequined gown).<BR> <BR>The trouble being that the guy across the street lives with a woman, seems about as straight as they come, and probably won't react well to Daniel's previous career as a female impersonator who mostly did Lady 2Di4, a Princess Diana tribute. Uh oh.<BR> <BR>The wit is just as sharp in this one as in \\"He's the One,\\" - and just as often nicely balanced with some poignancy that doesn't over-sweeten to saccharine levels.

It hurt.<br />For a fun read, this series - about the only wizard in the Chicago Yellow Pages - leaves nothing to be desired. But this fourth book turned everything on its edge, and was absolutely fabulous. A haggard Harry is trying to cope with everything that went so terribly wrong in the third book - not limited to, but including a very bad turn in his love life, the starting of a wizards-vs-vampires war (oops), and quite a bit of disfavour among the wizard's council.  And then of course, the fae come to collect on Harry's debt, old (and once murderous) love interests show up, and before you know it - Harry's hip deep again in trouble.<BR> <BR>As always, it's Harry's character that keeps you going (that and his air-spirit-trapped-in-a-crystal-skull sidekick, the oversexed Bob).  Harry is such a wonderful guy to follow that you can't help but feel for him, even as his winning chivalry gets him deeper and deeper into mess.  The mystery itself in this one - who killed one of the Fairy Court's Knights? - is just as interesting, and the Fairy culture that Butcher wove together is skillfully plotted.<BR> <BR>This was superb, and if you liked Anita Blake, or Tanya Huff's &quot;Keeper&quot; series, you'll love Harry Dresden.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2003-04-23

Basically, a bunch of rats, snacking on wizardly refuse, attain sentience. They also hook up with a sentient cat. They can all speak, learn, and chat with each other, and at the Cat's devious notion, dupe a \\"stupid looking kid\\" to play the role of a rat-piper, moving from city to city where the rats act up, the Piper comes in and clears the rats out, and they all get paid.<BR> <BR>This time, however, they've stumbled into a town where there's something really evil going on, and all the wisecracking cats, tapdancing rats, and stupid-looking kids in the world might just be in over their heads. <BR> <BR>Well written, with a bit of whimsy in nearly every chapter, this was my introduction to the Discworld series, and I dare say I'll be back. The wonderful observations from the rats point of view are fantastic (there's a great part where one of the rats is asked something along the lines of: \\"Do you know what animal swarms into a place, breeds terribly, spoils everything they can't use and wastes everything they can until there's nothing left?\\" and the rat says, \\"Sure. Humans.\\")<BR> <BR>The story gets a bit dark in places for a young reader, though a teen would probably get a laugh. And the mythology lover in me adores the play on the Pied Piper of Hamelin - like Orson Scott Card's \\"Enchantment\\" did for Sleeping Beauty, Pratchett did here for the Pied Piper of Hamelin.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2003-04-23

Still, the attempt was well done.<BR> <BR>They're just not all that rich a bunch of characters, so it gets a little stale, and rather quickly. What does save the tale is Jake's 1st-person journal entries, Jake's moral confusion over a group of people \\"doing good for profit,\\" and Jake's surety that he is where he is specifically to find and restore his father back to the universe.<BR> <BR>The surprise re-emergence of a character I, for one, had written off from ever appearing in DS9 again was nicely done, but what really got me going was the actual ending of the book, which promises big changes for the upcoming books in the series.  If that part of the tale had happened a bit earlier, and been written a bit longer, this probably would have earned 4 stars from me.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2003-04-23

Between his hunting down Mr. Perfect in all the wrong places, he has to deal with his ex - who has hooked up with a Mr. Wonderful of his own - Mr. Wonderful's ex - who wants Patrick to find his own Mr. Perfect to drive Patrick's ex to a jealous return, so that Mr. Wonderful comes back on the market, crazy rats, the CIA, his best friend's love life, and a confusing and unnanounced visit from his father.<br />All in all, this is a heartwarming tale, and I liked the direction it went.  The ultimate conclusion is a plausible one, amidst a novel that's just shy of slapstick in places.  There's a gentle touch to this story, in both dialogue and Patrick's thoughts, and it was a warm and snuggly sort of reading experience.<br />'Nathan	2003-04-20

For one, I'm really basking in tales that are of gay characters, but in another, I just flat-out enjoyed reading about these folk. The supporting characters are very evocative, and a solid cast of very believable individuals, each with a breath and life of their own.<BR> <BR>There's one passage in the book, however, that really stuck home for me - one of the characters discusses with another what the two saddest words in the english language are. The first, and somewhat pithy answer, is \\"What party?\\" The second answer has so much force of emotion behind it that it was the social equivalent of a punch to the stomach. I'd honestly managed to forget (repress?) the phrase and situation that it referred to, and seeing it on the page brought back some really terrible moments. Kudos to the author for the inclusion of such a topic in such a deft way.<BR> <BR>The book has more moments of humour than it has social commentary, and the ride is a joyful one. When self-made-successful hunk arrives in New York looking for Mr. Right, he has his eyes set on someone right away. Will he chase that person down, or maybe learn that Mr. Right isn't all that it's cracked up to be? The delight is in the telling, and I have to admit, the ending wasn't where I thought it would go.<BR> <BR>A story about friendship more than love, and about setting some pretty important priorities in life, there's a kind emotional honesty in this story. Though at a rare few times I got frustrated with the main character (It's hard to feel a lot of empathy sometimes, when the perfect-bod-perfect-job-jock-fantasy character is bemoaning his life a bit, especially when there's some ugly flashback moments of 'what he did in highschool to the local gay guy'), and annoyed at his single-mindedness in chasing a guy he barely knew anything about, the supporting cast at those times, and the minor mystery subplot, kept things going at a good clip. <BR> <BR>By the end, you'll like (nearly) everyone involved, and want to read more. Imagine my joy at learning there was a book prior to this one, with some of the same characters! I can't wait.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2003-04-05

There was a lot more to this tape than it seemed at first \\"reading.\\"  At first, I found myself a little wary of a terrorist plot, given how the very subject is super-charged with anxiety.  The plot, however, was more about a young man caught in very conflicting societies and belief systems, a teacher who wants to be better than he believes he is, and a sister's love of her brother making it near impossible to do the right things.<br />The plot is basically itself quite straightforward: a teacher is catapulted to fame when a school bus bombing gives him an opportunity to shine through with courage: he saves one person from the bus.  It doesn't last, however, as he is soon the key suspect in the bombing.  As the real terrorists plan a new assault, the teacher's life falls apart, and the sister to the man who planted the bomb starts to realize what is going on, the tension jacks up, notch by notch. <br />Joe Mantegna has a good voice for this tale, moving from the voices of a Moslem teen to a Brookyn teacher with ease, and without sounding overmuch like a bad stereotype.  His pacing is excellent.<br />It's a strong enough story to entertain, and it did make me think a little about the nature of courage and sacrifice.<br />'Nathan	2003-03-08

An autistic child gets a copy of a puzzle the FBI cryptographers planted into a Genius-level magazine. Basically, the kid sees the puzzle, solves it in about a minute, and then does what the puzzle solves into: instructions to call a number listed and tell that he solved the puzzle.  When he does, he's targetted for \\"removal.\\"<br />Putting the FBI into a tailspin of potential disaster - who is this person who called and cracked the code? And what will the man in charge of what is now a 10 million dollar mistake do to this child? The tension begins to rise...  Enter Art Jefferson, who is the one man who might be able to keep this autistic child alive long enough to get him to some sort of safety.<br />It has a good rising tension throughout, and definitely the last side of tape two is just a race of danger and bullet-dodging and so forth. Very well done. I didn't expect some of the last few twists - though quite a bit of the plot I did see coming - and the ending quite satisfied me. I liked it... though I'd love to know why the book/audiobook FBI agent was a huge black man - and the movie had Bruce Willis. Why do they do that?<br />Anyway - well worth the time, and the abridgement wasn't half bad. The only real frustration I had was that Joe Morton tried too many accents (his Japanese is borderline offensive stereotype), and that sometimes you were on name overload - there were a lot of characters to this one, and by the nature of abridgement, you didn't get into a lot of their heads.  Quite often I was thinking, \\"Wait, who's this guy again?\\"<br />'Nathan	2003-02-04

Lain has been crafting a series out of the iconic character written for the 3rd Edition release of Dungeons and Dragons, and Lain's latest, \\"The Bloody Eye,\\" is a bit more gruesome than the previous offerings.  Featuring Alhandra (the paladin), Jozan (the cleric), Krusk (the barbarian) and... a scullery maid... this one involves the plot of Jozan's former teacher to release an avatar of Gruumsh (think big bad evil one-eyed orc god) onto the land.  Twisted beasts, gorey eye-mutilations, hack-n-slash, and, of course, a dungeon crawl make this one of the solid 'brain candy' works of D&D fiction that is just the right size to eat up and enjoy in the space of an afternoon or a long bus ride.<br />Can the heroes defeat the foul evil, and reclaim the land for goodness?  Of course they can.  Duh.  But the fun is watching, not in guessing if they can...<br />What is frustrating is the 181 page length for the hefty $7.99 Canadian price - I'd rather the books be released in one volume of three tales for a higher price, if that means it would be of a more worthy length.  Regardless, as far as brain-candy reading goes, this is a good quick reading experience.<br />'Nathan	2003-01-26

This one deserved it, so there's the beginning of just how wonderful this book was.<br />Picture a book editor, Andrew, recently (and not willingly) single and gay, whose ex just picked up something younger and cuter.  Andrew's first two books are on the bargain bin, he's feeling pretty down, and then at an opening party for a new gay bar, he meets the man of his dreams, the man who could just maybe be, Mr. Right.<br />If Mr. Right was a quasi-heterosexual son of one of the worst Mafia Capo bosses in the city.  Oops.<br />I cried I laughed so hard.  This book isn't just funny, it's witty, and that's a style in short demand.  The bon-mots are fabulous, the plot is so completely outrageous that it has a Evanovich-esque slaptstick to it that just totally leaves you gasping for air between guffaws.  And beyond it all, there's Andrew, hopeless (and hopeful) romantic, dodging thugs, police, FBI, his best friends, and once or twice having nookie that will curl your toes.<br />Phenom.  If Byrnes has more, I'm buying it today.  If he doesn't, I hope he writes quickly - these are in no way heading the bargin bin, folks.<br />'Nathan	2003-01-22

It is obvious that the powers-that-be behind the DS9 relaunch are working to make this the best-written set of Star Trek books to date.  The &quot;Mission Gamma&quot; quartet continues to improve in quality of both writing and plot, and I, for one, can't wait for the next - and final - issue in teh quartet.<BR> <BR>&quot;Cathedral&quot; continues the two major story arcs: the Defiant's exploration of the Gamma Quadrant, and the inception of Bajor into the Federation.  The Defiant half deals with the apex of the trip through the Gamma Quadrant, where events conspire to force Nog, Bashir, and Ezri Dax to do some sincere soul-searching about the paths their lives have taken.  The counterpoint of the various character's spiritual sides was quite an enjoyable reading experience, and as the summary gives away, watching Julian Bashir's genetic enhancing degrade was fabulous plot.<br />The Bajor-Federation half of the story was just as satisfying, and there are hints of some pretty dark things on the way - I've come up with a few theories as to what is going on, but the book was written so well that I'm not sure, which is the perfect result.  Of interest is that Vedek Yevir's taking of centre stage for a good deal of this half of the book, and doing so in a very well characterized way.  He's not as one dimensional as we've previously seen, something that is well received of this reader, at least.<BR> <BR>Martin and Mangels also brought us the Section 31 Next Generation novel &quot;Rogue,&quot; which showed their already fantastic characterization and writing skills, and it is with great pleasure that I see them as a part of the DS9 Relaunch.<BR> <BR>You certainly won't see the ending coming, that's for sure.

To be perfectly honest, I felt much like each and every one of the reviews at different parts of this book.  I didn't really know where the book was going, found it wonderfully character-driven instead of plot-driven, got angry at all of the characters, and so on.<BR> <BR>The phrase \\"coming of age\\" has been beaten to death in the world of book reviews, but I can't think of another way to describe this novel.  The sheer damage done to a child when its mother mentions she'd like to die - and later commits suicide, sets this story off on a unique spiral.  The daughter, Isabel, grows under the vague shadow of this mother's suicide and with only the ephemeral bits and pieces she remembers of her mother: a love of theatre and movies, tennis, and, obviously, tea.<br />Isabel seems to try to bring those tiny bits - not enough to make a full picture of her mother - into her life at every major juncture.  She imagines what gifts her mother could give her at each birthday, for example.  She drifts quite a bit through life, without a whole lot of focus, in a way that can be alternately maddening and sad.  <BR> <BR>Somehow, this book managed to keep my attention and my empathy, even though I was often quite frustrated with Isabel and most of her friends - most of which are shallow and/or lacking in self-esteem.  In part, it was the language - the text in this book is just beautiful.  But though not a plot-driven book, the character of Isabel was also enough for me: she was by no means a perfect individual, and it was engrossing to wait and see if she could piece enough together from her ideas and half-rememberings to form a life of her own, free from under the very same half-ideas and rememberings she thinks she needs.<BR> <BR>I enjoyed this - don't get me wrong.  For all the various frustrations, it felt right to me on some level that led to real satisfaction in the reading.  But I can easily see how it would not be for everyone.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2002-09-26

I laughed out loud at least once a chapter at Evanovich's typical slapstick style of storytelling - enough to earn strange looks from the other passengers on the bus.<BR> <BR>This is no Stephanie Plum mystery - and I didn't go into it expecting one, which I think many others might have and would explain the overall low rating this book received.  I enjoyed it as what it was: crazy fun romantic hijinks with impossibly neurotic characters aplenty.  When you put in a blonde bombshell airhaid into the home of a strict but fair schoolteacher, add in a young genius who blows things up, a wrestler and his wrestling buddies, a polo-teaching rich man and his crazy ex-fiance, and, of course, an ineffective bug killer, you can't help but set the stage for typical Evanovich fallout.  When the schoolteacher falls for the playboy, despite the airhead's attempts to set her up with \\"Big John\\" the anatomically exaggerated wrestler, things are sure to fire up as zany as ever.<BR> <BR>My one real frustration with the book was how terribly it was edited.  Nick, the love interest of our heroine, is referred to as Neil a few times (why would you have to change the name of the character when this book was re-written?), and there are a large enough number of other small mistakes that derailed my train of thought just often enough to make me drop this review from four stars to three.<BR> <BR>This book was candy, not a three-course meal, and as a candy-book, it was wonderful.  You read it quickly, enjoy it, and then move on to another book.  Go in expecting a light and quick read, and you'll be happy.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2002-09-22

The story tends to have a lot more humour in it than you'd expect: two people end up running around a city naked in the pouring rain, for example, before the story is very far underway.  There's some classic fun in this one, as well as very dark villains and sometimes gore-laden descriptive text.  After all, undead are the enemy.<BR> <BR>There's no great mental challenge to these books so far, and that's fine - this is not reading intended to change your life, after all.  The length is still very short for the price, but the story - even if it is straightforward - is entertaining.  This is candy for the mind, easily and quickly enjoyed, and I'll happily admit I'm hooked.  <BR> <BR>'Nathan	2002-09-22

And, of course, a big revelation at the end that leaves you hanging and thinking, &quot;But... but... what next?&quot;<BR> <BR>Duncan Reever and Cherijo are their usual combustible selves.  They have a few trillion arguments and disagreements throughout this book, and as usual I found myself ready to toss Duncan out an airlock.  I have a hard time rationalizing why anyone - let alone Cherijo - would stay with this man, but I suspend my disbelief and keep reading like a good little book addict.  The rest of the plot is always worth it, and this book was no exception.  The other quibble was the use of &quot;babytalk&quot; when Cherijo's daughter was speaking.  Sometimes I had to read them aloud with a nasally kid-voice in an attempt to translate what the child was saying into english.  &quot;Pree dars&quot; is pretty stars, for example.

When pocket books began its relaunch of the DS9 series, starting where the series ended, I was interested in seeing where they'd go with the cast of characters, and also who they would add in to cover the gaps left by the show's finale.<BR> <BR>Including Lieutenant Ro as the new chief of security was a stroke of intelligence, but I'm begginning to think the two really strong moves of this new series were the transfer of Ezri Dax to the command branch, and the inclusion of an Andorian science officer, Ensign Thirishar ch'Thane.  This is their novel, for the most part, though the continuing plot of Bajor's potential entrance into the Federation is given as much time.<BR> <BR>ch'Thane's and Dax are contending with coming up with an objective third-party solution to an internal conflict with a people the Defiant crew have located in the Gamma Quadrant.  The parallels that pop up in both their lives are wonderful: for ch'Thane, there is a biological riddle here that is similar to the one his own people are facing, to Dax, this is a chance for her to flex her diplomatic skills as Curzon and Lela did before her.  Neither of their efforts result the way you'd think they would, and the turnaround is strong writing and a superb plot addition to the story arc.<BR> <BR>For all that Dax and ch'Thane have centre stage, there is still a lot of good time devoted to Kira, and the increasingly snarled complications of Bajor-Cardassia-Federation politics are becoming a joy to read.  This is plausible, enjoyable, conflict.<BR> <BR>Quite frankly, I enjoyed this DS9 novel the most of all that I have read so far, and applaud that the inside of the book tells us that Heather Jarman will be writing Trek again soon.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2002-09-07

The Andorian sub-plot that has been winding through this post-show series, which hasn't had much air time since the original Avatar books, gets a lot more intense in &quot;Twilight,&quot; and was definitely one of the best parts of the book.  Also, more is uncovered in the Commander Vaughn / Ensign Tenmei relationship.  There's a lot here, and most of it is quite good.<BR> <BR>Where the book fails a little is in a slowly unfolding romantic plot for Lieutenant Ro, the once-Enterprise crewmember, ex-Maquis, current chief of DS9 security who has replaced Odo.  I just couldn't quite find it plausible, no matter how hard I tried.

I have never read Gregory Benford before, and picked up &quot;The Martian Race&quot; from a bargain-bin pile with a little interest.  It strayed to my &quot;to be read&quot; pile, then finally worked its way to the surface.<BR> <BR>I am a big fan of Kim Stanley Robinson's &quot;Red Mars&quot; trilogy, and I found &quot;The Martian Race&quot; another strong extrapolation of potential future visits to our brother planet.  The team of four sent to Mars - intelligently told through the eyes of the team biologist and the only female of the group - are there not from NASA, not from science, but from the most basic of societal drives: Corporate Sponsorship and Prize Money.<BR> <BR>30 Billion to the first team to reach Mars, fulfill a series of scientific requirements, and return.  The conflict of the story is multi-levelled: the arrival of a second team trying to beat the first to the prize, the &quot;mere survival&quot; conflict of four humans trying to survive on Mars, and then a further twist that I don't want to ruin by mentioning.<BR> <BR>All in all, &quot;The Martian Race&quot; was an enjoyable reading experience, with enough &quot;real science&quot; to feel entirely plausible.  The plot curves catch you unaware, but don't feel overly contrived, and the fantastical element that becomes the third conflict is wonderfully crafted.<BR> <BR>The only real frustrations I had with the book were, as another reviewer mentioned, a rather weak ending, and a few occasions where I felt a few characters suddenly acted out of character for what we'd seen of them so far.  Regardless, you won't be let down with &quot;The Martian Race,&quot; especially if you enjoyed Robinson's &quot;Mars&quot; trilogy.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2002-08-24

Alan Dingwall is a real kid: he's worried about bullies, wonders if his parents care about him now that they're divorced, and envies his overweight friend's apparently happy family.  Alan struggles at math, and dreads the school bell that means the school population has to find a way out of the school without running afoul of the \\"Cougars\\" - the school bullies.<BR> <BR>Life is tough - and real - for Alan, and Scrimger pulls no punches.  <BR> <BR>Then an alien, Norbert, takes up residence in Alan's nose, and things go quickly awry in Alan's balanced (if somewhat sad) world.  Norbert is quickly mistaken for \\"Squeaky\\" - Alan's new nickname as the school's suddenly gifted ventriloquist.  As Squeaky starts tossing bon-mots aplenty around the school, Alan finds himself unwittingly insulting the bullies, telling girls how he really feels, and being - just this once - the life of the classroom.<BR> <BR>What's heartening about this tale is not really the antics of the alien in Alan's nose - though certainly the humour is a blast and it's enjoyable to the extreme.  What got my real vote was the true-to-life child frustration that Scrimger wove into the plot.  Alan worries that his father doesn't care about him anymore, and that his mother is just too busy to really pay attention.  He's a witty kid, and very smart (in non-math ways), and I doubt anyone would have any trouble empathising with Alan's world.<BR> <BR>The balance of humour and real-life in this book is nothing short of artful, and kids will appreciate not being spoken down to in this tale.  Snap it up, and be prepared for an eventually triumphant novel that will touch on some real emotionality.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2002-08-21

So here's the thing about mice: they're needy.  The power-packed little rodent might ask you for a cookie, but once you give him one: look out!  Because first he'll need milk, then a straw to drink the milk, and of course, a napkin... and oh, the places that little mouse will take you from there.  Exhausting a little boy with these wonderful nonsensical leaps of \\"if...then\\" is just one part of the joy of this book.<BR> <BR>Adults will love the fun of it - this is not a book you're going to tire of quickly.  Kids will love the antics of the mouse just as much, and the wonderful illustrations are a blast (when the Mouse realizes he's thirsty, there's a fabulous image of him holding his throat, tongue out, in melodramatic mousey style).<BR> <BR>This is one of the best childrens books I've come across in a long time, and I've picked up the rest of the Numeroff series since.  If you can, nab this one as the \\"mini book and stuffed animal\\" gift set - having a little mouse of your own (with cookie) is definitely worth the extra cost.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2002-08-09

Lammas often gets a paragraph or two at best, and no real descriptive text giving you even a starting point on cellebrating the sabbat.  Having taken a timid step toward the Sabbat series of books by Llewellyn with &quot;Yule,&quot; and &quot;Hallowe'en,&quot; I snapped up a copy of &quot;Lammas&quot; in time for my celebration in August, and read it cover to cover.<BR> <BR>Much like Morrison's worldly take in &quot;Yule,&quot; Franklin and Mason have penned a book that is a blend of various pagan and celtic folklore and world harvest celebrations.  From Lugh to fashioning corn maidens, to specific Lughnasa magics, and rounding it all up with a cookbook perfect for any first harvest spread, the book was quite full of ways to craft a more serious Lammas cellebration, and had just the right mix of inspiration and lore to make it more than a glorified arts and crafts book for your New Age shelf.  I cannot say enough about the folklore aspect of this book: there is so much here that helps bring a real focus to your Lammas cellebration.  <BR> <BR>Definitely more useful and in depth than Ravenwolf's &quot;Hallowe'en&quot; (the weakest of the series so far), &quot;Lammas&quot; will find a welcome home in the hands of beginner and more experienced pagans and wiccans alike.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2002-08-04

Easily digested, with a heavy dose of mind-candy fun, this book (re)introduces us to the core \\"Iconic\\" characters from the Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition put out by Wizards of the Coast.  And it doesn't fail on that level: Regdar is your typical fighter, Jozan your typical cleric, Naull is very much the young wizard in awe of her own abilities, and yes, Lidda the halfling rogue reads like a catty cynical teenager - but enjoyably so.<BR> <BR>The plot is straightforward: Dungeon delve, on behalf of a city where giant spiders are suddenly munching down on the local sheep.  What's motivating the spiders?  Who is behind it all?  How fast can the four heroes spell, crush, stab and otherwise toast those villains?  In 182 pages, that's how fast.   <BR> <BR>My only complaints being, really, the somewhat straightforward plot and the short length, \\"The Savage Caves\\" was still a single half-afternoon's blast to read, and brought out my inner geek.  I was grinning to myself and pointing out the use of a colour spray spell.  If you play D&D yourself, you'll notice all the ways the plot was written to accomodate the system.

I enjoyed reading \\"Jhereg.\\"  A friend pushed it into my hand saying that it had the best familiar ever since Tanya Huff's \\"Summon the Keeper,\\" and so I eagerly awaited my introduction to Loiosh, the familiar of the 'hero' of the story, Vlad.<BR> <BR>Thing is, Vlad's not that much a hero.  An assassin for hire, I found it hard to get all that attached to him, and read the book more for the interest of the setting itself.  Brust has put a rich world together here, where Sorcery and Witchcraft are two natural forces in a place where people have clanlines based on animals, and a complex \\"cycle\\" puts people into dominance based on their clan at various times.  It's rich, and interesting to explore the setting.<BR> <BR>The plot itself was very convoluted.  Put very simply, Vlad's target for assassination turns out to be somewhere very inconvienient for the act, politically speaking.  And from there the snarls and tangles of intrigue get really complicated.  While the setting made this interesting, I got lost more than once or twice, and frustrated at skipping back to reexamine why one individual hated another's family or clan.<BR> <BR>In and of itself, this was decent fantasy fare, and I don't regret reading it.  It made me smile, Vlad is witty, and although for the most part I was interested in how Vlad was going to figure out a way to make things work, I did find the ultimate solution a little deus et machina.  <BR> <BR>My friend was right though, Loiosh is a fabulously funny familiar.  I'm not sure if I'll be likely to grab any other Brust books, but I'm not going to avoid them, either.  If you enjoy anti-hero books with high political intrigue alongside the murders and manipulations, I'm sure Brust will be just your cup of tea.<BR> <BR>Thanan	2002-07-20

My previous experience with audiobooks hasn't been all that great, so I decided to try something shorter and by an author I'd also read.  \\"The Mist\\" was my choice, and it was an unfortunate choice. <BR> <BR>I have to wonder whether or not there was much corporate sponsorship in the making of this audiobook.  For one, at the sight of a mutated insect-monster set aflame trying to put itself out by smashing into the sauces aisle of a supermarket the reaction is not shock or dismay.  It's literally a character moaning that there's \\"Ragu and Prego everywhere!\\"  Uh, what?  Ruffles, Bud Light, many products get quite a bit of audio-time.<BR> <BR>The story itself was likely a good one: after a quick storm, people find themselves trapped inside a grocery store, surrounded by a thick mist, and monstrous horrors attack and kill anyone who steps out into the horrible thick fog.  But alas, the voices chosen for the characters were very poor -especially the apparently sinous-infected young boy, and the reactions of the voice-overs to the attacks are just as bad -\\"Oh my god, get it off me!\\" never sounded so flat as on this tape.<BR> <BR>I'm not done with trying audiobooks quite yet, but I'm beginning to think it's just a genre not for me.  At the very least, I suggest that if you, too, are flirting with the audiobook, try something by Stuart MacLean, not Stephen King.  Certainly not, \\"The Mist.\\"<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2002-07-06

I do want part two - \\"Humans\\" - but \\"Hominids\\" itself was a self-contained story with a plot that was resolved even though there is definitely more coming.  <BR> <BR>Parallel worlds are old-hat to Science Fiction, but Sawyer has managed to take a refreshing look at the hook in this novel.  The parallel world is an earth where Neanderthal were the humans who rose to the position of dominant species, not Homo Sapiens.  The society that Sawyer crafts for these Neanderthal is extrapolation at its best, with an admixture of social commentary that doesn't quite reach preachy status.  The parallels drawn are at once both interesting and slightly embarrassing: in nearly all things, it seems, those Neanderthal's are our better.  Though that's an initial thought and emotional reaction, the more I read, the more I felt the gap shortening.  I have a strong feeling Sawyer is going somewhere with this theme.<BR> <BR>Two plots co-exist in this novel: a Neanderthal scientist is rudely dropped into our world, the first plot.  The second plot is that of the scientist's partner, who is accused of murdering the scientist, who has so completely vanished.  <BR> <BR>For intelligent, thought-provoking science fiction, go no farther than Robert J.

Though some times her descriptions can get a little flighty and are over-exagerated to prove a point, they are effective for illustrating what Morgan means.<BR> <BR>In subject, &quot;Simple Wicca&quot; covers the basics quite well.

There's also a good list of references, book and web, for more information on most of the topics that Morgan covers.  <BR> <BR>All in all, this is a decent book for beginners, but those with even a little experience in Wicca or Paganism will find this book fairly second nature.

Worse, he's got himself enrolled in obedience school after happily digging through three potted plants in the livingroom.  And eating the corners off the cushions.  And chasing a cat onto a roof and... well, you get the idea.<BR> <BR>He's a loveable mutt, and kids reading the tale will have a good laugh at the thought processes of this adorable mutt.

This time, Norbert is residing in the nose of a scruffy dog named Sally, and Alan is visiting his father in New York.<BR> <BR>However, his father doesn't show up at the airport, and Alan finds himself lost and alone with the wheelchair-bound Frieda, a sarcastic and somewhat angry girl a year older than himself.  The two end up smack dab in the middle of quite the adventure: thieves are smuggling in Egyptian artifacts on the very flight the two kids took, and it seems that Frieda - whose parents also neglected to show up - might hold the key to solving the mystery. <BR> <BR>The strength of Richard Scrimger's writing is in his characters.  Alan, the narrative voice of the book, is a completely realistic young man (or at least, as realistic a young man as one could be when caught up in an illegal Egyptian artifact smuggling right with a wheelchair-bound cranky girl and a dog with an alien in its nose).  Reactions of both adult and child alike are done intelligently, and presented with a realistic emotional overtone: When Alan's father doesn't show at the airport, for example, Alan has a mental replay of his divorced parents fighting about his father's lack of responsibility.  Put simply, Scrimger doesn't pull punches, and it's a pleasant surprise - it's also a nice reminder of just how young kids tend to think - and what they think - about the world around them.<BR> <BR>A good tale for reading aloud, \\"A Nose for Adventure\\" will likely promote some intelligent questions from the child that reads it.  The chapters are just the right length for bitesized nightly reading sessions before bed, and I, for one, can't wait to read the book again - this time with my nephew.<BR> <BR>First, though, I think I'll go grab a copy of \\"Nose from Jupiter,\\" the first book in the series.  \\"A Nose for Adventure\\" didn't suffer for my lack of reading the first book, but I imagine it will flourish with the other half of the tale.

Not possible.  I was on it faster than Vinnie on the aleged duck, and I don't regret it a bit.<BR> <BR>Fans will not be upset with the typical crazy-life Stephanie events.  Her sister Valerie is still about, and losing her perfect sainthood.  Grandma Mazur is alive and kicking and still ready with the perfect ill-timed comment.  Lula buys boots and dyes her hair.  Cars explode.  Bob vomits.  Crazed rabbits, bears, and ex-presidents are chasing down Steph... and just you wait until you get to the geese incident.<BR> <BR>Then there's the romantic confusion.  Morelli, Ranger, and Stephanie hit the peak of their sexual tension in this book, and tip over in a way that knocked me reeling.  I wasn't expecting who ended up sleeping with who, and what it meant.  How's that for a vague way to avoid plot spoiling?  It was definitely worth the ride, though.<BR> <BR>Aside from the zany and the romantic, however, there's a darker tone that we've not seen since the very first book.  Echoes of the psychotic boxer return in another character, and the whole issue of battered wives fleeing their husband with children they've snatched away in the middle of the night is not your usual Plum story.  That said, it fit.  As the stakes rose - and grew more serious than the usual Steph life-catastrophes of the previous books - so did the emotional reactions of the characters involved.  And the ending will blow you away: I refuse to give it away, but I was left with a real bit of gutwrench.  This one doesn't leave you dangling with a romantic \\"Oh gosh!\\"  It leaves you stunned with a \\"Yow... harsh!\\"<BR> <BR>The story does wind up a bit quickly after dancing and drawing itself out - the pace is a bit breakneck at the end as things suddenly all reach the denouement, the book's only real failing.  But otherwise, prepare to laugh out loud throughout, and be a little surprised at the content in this one.  \\"Hard Eight\\" is hard indeed.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2002-06-20

As far as my science fiction reading goes, I normally prefer my science plausible, but not hard: my own science background was physics and chemistry to the end of highschool, and then a mild spattering of brain-centric biology for my psych/english lit degree.  <BR> <BR>Imagine my surprise when I found &quot;Venus&quot; to be a science fiction novel with a strong plot as well as hard science.  The science in this fiction does not overwhelm, with the typical use of a character or two that aren't as accomplished in the realms of science as the others, forcing the more educated to explain to the others - and the reader.  <BR> <BR>The plot itself starts as a basic 'run for money.'  A truly hateful man sets up a prize: 10 billion for the first person to return from Venus with the remains of his son, who died there on the first manned mission to the hellish planet.  The other son, a weakling, a runt, and a bit of a dandy, rises unexpectedly to the challenge, and the race is on.<BR> <BR>That said, this 'protagonist' is the least enjoyable part of the book.  The main voice of the novel, he begins as a whiny, spoiled, soft and clueless man, and though he almost immediately begins to grow, there are points at which you'd gladly see him tossed out an airlock.  <BR> <BR>Woven into the story is a rich tableau of family secrets and hatreds, a political -vs- corporate battle, and of course, the hostile attempts to survive in the hellish world that is Venus herself.  <BR> <BR>For a fast-pace action science fiction novel, 'Venus' delivers in spades.  The characterizations are often a little slow to growth (especially our 'hero'), but suffer through his views for the first quarter of the book and I promise you you'll be involved and interested in his welfare from there out.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2002-06-13

For one, Harry has a rather self-defeating chivalrous attitude about women, and a seriously horrible track record with dating.  His relationship with the typical \\"behind the scenes wizard council\\" is very strained: in fact, he's on a sort of deadly probation for some very questionable acts in his past.  He's the only \\"out\\" wizard in Chicago, and usually, he's broke.<BR> <BR>\\"Storm Front\\" puts Harry in the middle of a series of truly grotesque sorcerous murders.

His terrible luck with machines (a side effect of being a magical person), his awful luck with women, and his rather unique approach to magical information storage and retrieval (an oversexed talking air spirit trapped in the form of a skull) are sure to keep you reading.  <BR> <BR>If you're a fan of Anita Blake, then there's a chance you'll enjoy Harry Dresden.  Harry is funnier, much moretame, and though the crimes strike a similar chord, the novel in its entirety is much more light-hearted than any of the Blake bloodbaths.  As far as mysteries with a twist go, I'd grab \\"Storm Front\\" in a heartbeat.  You'll be glad you did.<BR> <BR>I, for one, picked up \\"Fool Moon,\\" the next in the series, the very next day.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2002-05-31

The original five book series &quot;The Blending,&quot; was a fun, witty, and enjoyable read.  The characters were interesting, and their complicated relationships, and continual misunderstandings were amusing and trying all at the same time.  By the end of the five books, you were content with where the characters had reached.<BR> <BR>Then the sequel trilogy.  The Blending Enthroned, book one and two, showed a marked decrease in the writing quality from the first five.  The descriptive text was gone, replaced by conversation: no longer did you read wonderful descriptions of rich tapestries, instead, two characters had forced and awkward conversations along the lines of: &quot;Oh Gosh, Tamma, notice the fine tapestries!&quot; &quot;Why yes, Jovvi, they seem so rich and pretty.&quot;  It was actually painful.<BR> <BR>Book three continues this trend, and worsens it.  Plot is replaced with the six Blendingmates merely discovering more and more inherent powers, they blast their way through any trouble, and their conversations are nothing more than praise fests and mutual agreement.  One character comes up with a plan, the rest praise him for it.  One character does something, the rest swarm the individual with praise.  Again, it's painful.<BR> <BR>Still, from love of the original five, I finished this trilogy.  I shouldn't have even started it: the ending of this story is contrived, and outright Deus ex Machina!  Everything about this book is contrived, from language, to plot, to ending.  It was thouroughly disappointing.<BR> <BR>It's unfortunate.  The original five books were wonderful, and with the minor exclusion of a few plot details that polished up a character or two, there wasn't anything in this book that was worth the price.  Do go read the first five, but stop there.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2002-04-19

Imagine a world where there exists a magic process that allows you to transfer all of one of your traits to another person.  All of your strength, or wit, or stamina, moved from your own body into that of your Lord.<BR> <BR>Such is the world of the Runelords.  Men and women who can have the strength of many, the wit of many, the metabolism of multiple men, the Runelords are somewhat complacent, their kingdoms rubbing with a friction born of internal intrigues, and entirely unprepared for the battle that is coming.<BR> <BR>A Runelord from the south is coming, a man who seeks to be \\"the Sum of All Men,\\" by taking so many traits from others that he becomes invincible.  His attacks are merciless, and only the rising of a new Earth King can possibly stop him - and even this is not assured.<BR> <BR>Farlane's world is one full of interesting ideas.  Wizards fit one of the four elements (Air, Earth, Water, and Fire) in a new way that I found interesting, and the process of the transfer of traits from one to another was a fresh idea.  Unfortunately, those who transfer all their strength, for example, end up so crippled they cannot even lift themself.  If they die or are killed, the trait they would offer to their runelord also vanishes - or if the runelord dies, the \\"Dedicate\\" (the one who gave up the trait) gets the trait back.<BR> <BR>Too much of the book was about the murder of Dedicates - the easiest way to disarm the runelord who has multiple traits.  While the book had some interesting segues, it could have been more interesting without the constant repeat of this theme of killing dedicates.<BR> <BR>The next book in the series is \\"The Brotherhood of the Wolf,\\" and I'm going to give it a try.  If you're interested in a fresh new fantasy world with a unique twist, then you might enjoy \\"the Runelords.\\"  It's not on par with George R.R. Martin, but it would likely satisfy fans of Robert Jordan.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2002-03-30

I had high hopes for this novel, and for the most part, I really did enjoy it, with two major caveats:<BR> <BR>First, the story drags in its beginning.  The tale set-up is rich, and full of detail about the Aurenfae culture, but, well, that brings us to the second major problem: the language.  I couldn't keep track of who was who, who did what, and what rank and title meant what.  There were so many apostrophes and hyphens and unpronouncable words that I got totally lost.  <BR> <BR>What saved this novel for me was the characterization of Beka, Alec, and Seregil, with a deft touch to the Alec-Seregil relationship that was wonderfully written.  It is a joy to come across a gay relationship within a fantasy novel that isn't reduced to random loveless acts of coupling, and instead is a real, loving, partnership.  It is also interesting to see the attitudes that Flewelling has extrapolated from her matriarchal/equality driven society.  <BR> <BR>Thero also gets centre stage in this novel, which is ultimately a storyline about diplomacy and relations between the Aurenfae and the country we're used to seeing from the previous two novels.  <BR> <BR>The book needed some sort of glossary, or less confusing fantasy tongue, and the plot needed a kick-start, but other than that, it was right on target for Flewelling's usual character-driven stories.  I reccommend it, but don't go looking for it as a page-turner.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2002-03-07

Having read Flewelling's other three books in the \\"Nightrunner\\" series, I snapped up \\"Bone Doll's Twin\\" with a little bit of frustration: it was a prequel.  I wanted more from Alec and Seregil, not new characters, so I resisted for a while before settling down to read this book.<BR> <BR>I'm glad I waited, because now I'm salivating over the next in the trilogy.<BR> <BR>The story is actually rather straightforward, and one we know quite a bit about already as \\"history\\" in the Nightrunner series.  There was a mad king who killed off all his female relatives, so that the ancient prophecy of a Queen on the throne could not come to pass: even though the prophecies were clear: the kingdom wouldn't prosper without a Queen on the throne.<BR> <BR>Enter the heroes.  When twins are born to a royal bloodline, one a girl, and one a boy, the heroes kill - yes, kill - the baby boy and wrap the baby girl up in an illusion of being male that will last long enough to keep the girl alive to the point of taking the throne.  Alas, the girl herself doesn't even know what's going on - she believes she's a boy named Tobin, and the dead brother is a haunting demon-spirit, rather upset at being murdered in such a way...<BR> <BR>The empathy and pathos of this story was remarkable.  The heroes had to get their hands dirty from step one - and it's still coming - and you can't help but be drawn into their plight as they do truly evil things for the greater good.  Likewise, poor Tobin is living a lie throughout the book - and you can keenly feel his sense of not being \\"quite right,\\" and his desire for a normal life with a good friend.<BR> <BR>Where this series is going seems likely to be even darker, and the characters all seem to hover in a fragile state: you get the impression that many of these folks are going to die a nasty death.  It's truly captivating.  Fans of James Clemens or George R.R. Martin should definitely give this series a shot.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2002-02-28

A serial killer with a strange unknown motive, a psychiatrist with a budding new relationship, a detective on his last chance, and a young businesswoman with a psychic ability that laid dormant for years - and has come back.<BR> <BR>Alas, half way through the book, it was easy to figure out who the villain was.  Throughout the book, Passman gives glimpses into the psyche of the villain by showing you pages from the serial killer's diary.  I noticed something glaringly obvious, and it gave away the plot.  <BR> <BR>The last half of the book turned into a frustrating waiting game for me: waiting for the good guys to figure out what was going on, as the clues became more and more obvious.  <BR> <BR>The first half of the book was indeed quite good, it's just that the author played too many cards and gave away his hand.  The characterizations are decent enough, but once you know what's going on, the book loses its shine.  If Passman has another book out there, and I see it in a used bookstore or the like, I'll give it a shot, but I'm not much inspired to find more of his works.<BR> <BR>For those of you looking for good psychic thriller fiction, I'd suggest Martha C.

Picking up where we left off in &quot;Have Tech, Will Travel,&quot; this series of short stories of the Starfleet Corps of Engineers is collectively titled &quot;Miracle Workers.&quot;<BR> <BR>First, the &quot;Interphase&quot; tale is completed, and I was quite impressed with the tone and pace of the second half of the story.  It had a rare amount of nostalgia to it that didn't suffer from being trite or overwrought.  As always, the characters shine - again proving that in the Star Trek universe, the depth of the character is what matters, not how much screen time they might have had on the television shows or movies.<BR> <BR>From there, while there are less stories in this package, the tales are of such high quality that you don't suffer from the lack of them.  Nog, as a lieutenant from the DS9 Books set in the &quot;Avatar&quot; and &quot;Abyss&quot; timeline, guest-stars in one of the stories, and doesn't distract from the overall story.  The authors really have a deft touch with these shared characters: I have never noticed a character to act out of character from previous stories - quite a feat! <br />The only negative I can mention from the reading was the inclusion of the &quot;Androssi&quot; as a villain race that the S.C.E. have previously battled - but we have never seen.  It was a bit awkward, and made me wonder if I'd missed a story somewhere - the aliens were spoken of as something I should know, but no real details were given.  I enjoy good backstory, but there was too much left to backstory in this case.<BR> <BR>The inclusion of a &quot;Minipedia&quot; - an encyclopedia of all the information from the various stories in the S.C.E. series, and it was well received by this reader.  It was good to look up minor characters and events and have them on hand.<BR> <BR>Grab it folks, Trek fans of all kinds will be happily surprised... <BR> <BR>'Nathan	2002-02-09

Having just finished \\"Wit'ch Gate\\" in the space of two evenings, I must say that I've put the stuttering-effect of apostrophes aside, and will joyfully dive into this series again.<BR> <BR>The cast of characters seemed swollen to capacity with the last book in the series, and you're in for a rough ride.  Clemens has a real ability to make you care about characters, and then when those characters end up facing potential death, certain death, or outright suicide, you're gripping the book with frustration: you don't want them to die.<BR> <BR>Elena takes a little bit of a back seat in this book, and that works out fine.  The other characters, especially Elena's brother Joach, Kast, and Nee'lahn, shine forth in this book with a real aplomb.  The story splits three-ways, and the following of one group up to a cliffhanger and then switching to another group is a style that will leave you twitching.  All in all, this book is a truly enjoyable experience of fantasy.<BR> <BR>Specific to the plotline, the group has to split three ways in order to tackle three of the four wiergate creatures of which they learned in the previous book.  The story is sensible, the plot twists are unpredictable without being unplausible, and the magic at no time overpowers the characters or the story to the point of Deus Et Machina.  It doesn't matter how powerful the characters may be, it is not their power, but their soul or heart that matters.  Solutions to previous plot conflicts are well thought out and always surprising (especially those in the case of the former-hero Kast, twisted to dark magics, and that of the Mogweed/Fardale shapeshifters trapped in one form).<BR> <BR>Specifically, I find myself actually worried for some of the characters, and to manage that level of empathy for a character is a real skill indeed.  I cannot find anything I found negative enough to mention, and as a result, a rare five stars from me.  Grab this one - grab the whole series first - and sit down to a truly great story.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2002-02-01

Disaster strikes that small mission, some die, and they leave the planet behind.  The head of the exploration mission, a man named Nightingale, is left in disgrace.  Twenty years pass, and the impact will happen rather shortly, and so, a scientific mission of observers arrive to watch the fireworks...<BR> <BR>And spot a building on the planet.  Then ruins of a city.  Suddenly, the planet that has been ignored for nearly twenty years is a planet that once supported intelligent life, and a ship is diverted to send a landing craft to see what they can see before the grand impact.  A cruel twist of fate lands Nightingale on the diverted ship, and when the group reach the ground, the disaster begins in earnest: they're stranded there.<BR> <BR>McDevitt has a real knack for using science fiction as a setting for character development, and for further jacking up the tension notch by notch with believable accidents, twists of fate, and general human-error.  This book was no exception, and as always, with McDevitt, you have no idea who will make it to the last pages of the book.<BR> <BR>A sequel of sorts to &quot;The Engines of God,&quot; some characters carry over from &quot;Engines,&quot; but there'd be no real loss to not have read the earlier novel before reading &quot;Deepsix.&quot;  <BR> <BR>High tension fantasy, a rolicking good cast, and a strength of plotline worthy of the greats of Science Fiction, this book had me gripped from start to finish.  The only real annoyance to the book was the continuous attacks by random alien lifeforms - it got frustrating to see yet another attack by yet another different sort of strange creature, and as another reviewer pointed out, almost &quot;movie-like.&quot;  McDevitt has the ability to jack up the tension already, he didn't need to resort to the blunt tool of &quot;bad critters.&quot;<BR> <BR>Best, though, I don't think we're done with the character of Priscilla Hutchins, and there are a few hints of a further book in this &quot;series.&quot; <BR> <BR>'Nathan	2002-01-19

She is sarcastic, raw, blunt, and a real joy to read.<BR> <BR>Still recovering from the death of her \\"Chosen,\\" Cherijo has been adopted by his people, the Jorenians, and the book mostly takes place with Cherijo on the Jorenian ship 'Sunlace,' interacting with the crew and those few characters who carried over from the previous novel.<BR> <BR>The mystery is good, but not stellar: a series of murders seem to be potentially aimed at Cherijo, and the Leage is still after her as a nonsentient, trying to blow the 'Sunlace' out of the sky, causing chaos and death on a regular basis througout the novel.  Cherijo's struggling to cope with a Euthanasia-Positive culture is very well written, as is her wrestling with the guilt of being the cause of all the attacks on the ship.<BR> <BR>Where the story breaks down is the ending.  I'm all for a cliffhanger ending, for the most part, but not one that is a dramatic total reversal that leaves you blinking, with no explanations, and then a fade-to-black.  \\"Beyond Varallan\\" does this, and it was not appreciated by this particular reader, though it wasn't enough to make me not buy and read \\"Endurance.\\"<BR> <BR>For the strength of character in this book series, I'd give this one a go.  The exporation of present day issues clouded in the alien cultures is similar to that of Star Trek, and handled at least as well.  It really is very good, but the ending is likely to leave you frustrated, and feel a little like you've been blunty forced into continuing in the series to see \\"what next?\\"	2002-01-13

For those of us who truly enjoyed &quot;The Third Victim,&quot; and its heroine, the somewhat acidic Rainie Connor, she's back in &quot;The Third Victim,&quot;  Now an ex-Officer who has opened up her own private investigation agency, and whose relationship with FBI profiler Pierce Quincey has floundered and ground to a halt, Connor finds herself once more entangled with Quincey when someone with a grudge starts to aim at Quincey and his family.<BR> <BR>While the romantic entanglement with Quincey and Connor is interesting and plausible, I have to admit the real love in this book, for me, is Connor herself.  She's a heroine that's missing from most novels these days: strong without being ridiculous or cold, with her own set of neuroses and troubles and problems that make her as human as the next.  <BR> <BR>The story itself has a frantic pace, for the full first half of the book I didn't know who was the next victim, who was entangled with the killer, who the killer was - all signs of the best kind of thriller: one that keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat.  I loved reading this book.<BR> <BR>Once the killers identity is uncovered, however, things fizzle a little.  I found that the killer was a bit over-the-top at points, and sometimes I wondered at the lack of insight in the other characters (while it is posed that the killer is pretty much a genius at appearing as he wishes to appear, he also states he gives all his victims a sporting chance with slight clues and faults in his disguises, for example: so how come no one figures him out?).  That said, the story as a whole had me hooked, the characters of both Ronnie and Quincy's daughter were quite a good duet, and I'll happily grab onto the next Ronnie/Quincey book that (hopefully) comes along!<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2001-11-27

The quality of SF within &quot;Stardoc&quot; will have me picking up &quot;Endurance,&quot; and the rest of the Stardoc series at my next earliest opportunity.  The heroine is a strong character, with a twist in her past sure to make you blink a few times.  The plot itself is not just the &quot;science fiction meets medical thriller&quot; it first appears to be, and again, the plot twist in this regard is a good one.  <br />Dr. Cherijo is a worthy character, with a strong personality (ie: stubbourn and headstrong), interesting neuroses, and strong and wonderful without being infallable and annoying.  This is not a woman who weeps easily, nor is she a cold-hearted statue.  The line is difficult to walk, but Viehl did so.<BR> <BR>What the novel suffers from slightly - and the only reason I didn't give it a five-star rating - is the overabundance of aliens.  While plot-centric, this tendancy to earth animals into aliens is somewhat frustrating (Spider-aliens, for example, who can spin webs, etc).  Regardless of this shortcoming, however, I really enjoyed the book.  <BR> <BR>What is also suprising is the number of ethical or moral dilemmas that Viehl manages to toss into the mix:  The rights of sentients, animal rights, racism.  There's a lot in here that you don't normally find in your SF paperbacks.  <BR> <BR>Overall, this one is worth it - grab it and read it, but be prepared to fall in love with the heroine, and want more of her in the form of the rest of the series!<br />'Nathan	2001-11-26

While quite good on one hand: that hand being the explanation of Lieutenant Mark McHenry, on the other hand, the lack of focus on one ship that has begun with this book is a bit frustrating.  <BR> <BR>The majority of this book deals with the young lieutenant who has displayed an exacting spacial sense, and whose tendancy to appear asleep has become routine to the rest of the crew.  The McHenry story is interesting, good-humoured, and touches on some Original Series era episodes.  It is well-done, and enjoyable, especially as the rest of the crew of the USS Excalibur-A tries to deal with the notion of just who - and what - McHenry is.<BR> <BR>Where the book gets frustrating is the other portion of the book, where we keep zipping back and forth between the McHenry &quot;A&quot; story and finding ourselves in the USS Triton, which is Captain Shelby's ship, as it continues along its previous plotline of the M'Ress and Gleau storyline, and adds in a new potentially related story with the Danteri and Si Cwan.  <BR> <BR>The result is overload:  Too many characters, two plotlines that would have been more interesting as two separate books, and once more, a cliffhanger ending.<BR> <BR>Buy it for McHenry, and for the interaction of Shelby and her XO: Mueller; but as a whole, it'll let you down a little.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2001-11-26

The story itself is self-contained, and you don't need to read all the other books in the Gateways mini-series for it to make sense (something mini-series writing Trek books need to do more often).  <BR> <BR>Secondly, the characters progress from where we last saw them in the New Frontier novels - Shelby on her own ship, with her own crew.  I liked two additions to what I hope is the regular cast: M'ress and Arex - characters you may remember from the cartoon of the original series.  Though I did find that some of the &quot;return&quot; characters seemed a little forced - Shelby basically snapped up half the crew from the Grissom from when Calhoun served aboard said ship, the entirety of the USS Triton was well done.<BR> <BR>The plot was excellent - self contained, like I said, but also playing around with some interesting philosophical ideas: what is &quot;holy land,&quot; what's the point of fighting over it, etc.  Peter David is fairly true to characters when these issues arrive - it is the tactical-minded Shelby who can't comprehend the notion of fighting over something called &quot;holy,&quot; for example.  Add the usual level of witty conversation between characters and crew, and you've got a great book here, folks.<BR> <BR>Grab it.	2001-10-14

As another reviewer wrote, people say they're not able to make it for dinner - and are then present at dinner.  There are other mistakes such as those that get frustrating over time, and I wonder who edited this novel.<BR> <BR>That said, this was much better than &quot;The Hanged Man,&quot; which was my first TJ MacGregor book, and I will look for other novels from this author - I'll just be really careful to read the first chapter or so before buying.<BR> <BR>&quot;Seventh Sense,&quot; was a book super-saturated with characters - a few times I got a little lost (&quot;Who is this guy?&quot;), but otherwise, the mystery of it was well done.  The psychics come off very plausible, and the supporting character of the wife of the man who committed the hit-and-run stole the show.

I've been following the books that continue the story of DS9 past the point of the final episode in the TV Series, and I've been really enjoying them.  For one, there's the more &quot;Serial&quot; nature to them: the new DS9 books don't always end with everything wrapped up that was introduced (indeed, Jake has been missing somewhere inside the wormhole for a few books now).  For another, there's the lack of &quot;reset&quot; to the books: most of the Star Trek books can't change anything major, as the characters would show these changes thereafter in the series, whereas with the DS9 books, now that the series is over, this isn't the case.<BR> <BR>All of that said, the plot in this book was very fragmented.  I realize it is one of the books in a series, but standing alone, parts of it didn't even make sense: The Iconians have come back, is the premise, and they've opened up all their old doorways in space as almost an example to the quadrant over what they're selling to the highest bidder, but some Malon antimatter waste is coming through one of those gateways, ruining a planet nearby DS9.<BR> <BR>So, the story is basically a rescue attempt from DS9.  Unfortunately, the other plot wrinkles all suffer from a stutter: you have a lot of cliffhangers in the end of this book, and yet nearly nothing is resolved at all.  I don't mind a &quot;serial,&quot; but to give me nothing completed is something else.  Also, given that a lot of the readers of the DS9 books aren't going to go pick up five other books just so that the DS9 book in this series makes sense, and you've got a problem with this one.<BR> <BR>There was quite a bit of merit in the book: the exploration of what's going on with Dax was interesting, and you get quite a bit more character development from Shar, the new ensign science officer for DS9.  Still, both of these didn't quite save the book entirely for me, and I was let down.  If you do want to keep reading the DS9 books that are set after the series, thisone is necessary, as Dax and Shar have some important revelations, but in and of itself, the novel doesn't stand alone, and you may find that to really enjoy it, you'll need the other books in the &quot;Gateways&quot; series.<BR> <BR>'Nathan	2001-09-19

Czerneda caught my eye with &quot;A Thousand Words for Stranger,&quot; and I've done my best to get a hold of everything she has written since.  So far, she has delivered high quality, character-driven SF, without ever letting the alien aspect or the technology totally dominate the storyline.<BR> <BR>&quot;In the Company of Others,&quot; delivers this as well.  Humans reached the stars - and finding no one out there, began to terraform worlds for colonization.  And then it all went wrong: the Quill showed up on worlds that were terraformed, making them uninhabitable for humanity.  What are the Quill?  No one really knows, and that mysterious overtone drives the first double-hundred pages of the book.<BR> <BR>As usual, Czerneda's strength lies in her characters, most notably the empathic Aaron Pardell, who is the only human to have survived a Quill world.  He could be the saviour of mankind, or it's destruction... And you're left hanging in that balance for most of the book, as unsure as everyone else.<BR> <BR>Give this one a read if you're looking of a complete-in-and-of-itself SF read by one of Canada's finest SF Authors.

Jim Munroe is a Canadian, and I always try to give fellow Canucks a fair shake, but the title made me blink away from the book.  My mistake.<br />First off, the surreal plot set up for the book makes you think you're going for an odd story with lots of laughs:  Our hero Ryan can turn into a fly.  His girlfriend from the diner can make objects disappear, and had a baby from an alien father.  Much fun ensues, right?<br />Well, yes, but not entirely.  Starting off with a fun romp at fighting Corporate Power (the big evil of the twenty-something crowd), and striving for the Feminist Ideals (the big good of the twenty-something crowd), the book has pep and hilarity and a trove of other enjoyable moments.<br />Then things go deeper.  Ryan's mother is diagnosed with breast cancer, and from there the story, while still light on many levels, takes a more serious turn that sneaks up on you and keeps you hooked right up to the end.  Some very heavy topics are brought up in this book, as well as some lighter pokes at those things my age-group tends to consider &quot;Important!&quot; with a capital I.<br />I will definitely grab a copy of &quot;Angry Young Spaceman,&quot; which is Munroe's second novel.  If you're in the mood for some semi-serious social commentary with a lighthearted twist, snap up &quot;Flyboy.&quot;  Just be prepared for strange looks from people if you read it on the bus.<br />'Nathan	2001-08-31

I am fan of mysteries and thrillers with a psychic character in them, MacGregor definitely delivers a tale tight with psychic abilities. &quot;Project Delphi&quot; spawned seven psychics taken from prisons, trained by the FBI, and used as psychic assassins and spies. Now, years after the project was disbanded when three of its members escaped, the seemingly random murder of a criminal psychologist - and the kidnapping of his wife - is anything but random after all.<BR>Enter Mira Morales. A psychic who tuned in on the murder before it happened, and a woman for whom the police have no respect, she just might be the only thing capable of unravelling the conspiracy, uncovering the criminals, and saving the kidnapped woman's life... if she can live that long with three trained psychics after her, and only one detective on her side.<BR>Definitely a thriller, this book had me gripped. There's only a few parts to the book that had me annoyed, but they were fairly minor (there's a whopping big coincidence to the book's plot that made me twitch). Moreover, the psychic abilities take centre stage without causing harm to the plot nor the characterizations. This was a good read, and fans of Kay Hooper, Margaret Lawrence, and Joseph Glass should like it.<BR>'Nathan	2001-08-29

Tom Carter has reached the top - the Nobel prize for developing the \\"Genescope,\\" a device that reads your genetic coding and tells you your genetic future. Then imagine a long fall. Carter's wife is hit and killed by an assassin's bullet that was meant for him, and worse, the Genescope that won him the Nobel has just discovered his daughter has about a year left to live before the onset of incurable brain cancer. Now, Carter turns to genetics and mythology and miracle, seeking to uncover the genes that would grant a miraculous ability: the healing touch. Colliding with an ancient secret order, the genetics of Jesus, and a conspiracy that crosses continents, Tom Carter is facing a countdown toward his daughter's death, and the potential possesion of the power of life over death being in the wrong hands - perhaps even his own. As far as thrillers go, this was decent - it kept me thinking, was a bit heavy on the gross-factor (torture, blood, and the like was a tad overdescribed in places). The plot of genetics leading to healing powers were very well done, and crossing into the Judeau-Christian mythology was quite a good stroke on Cordy's part. The main villain(s) of the book were sometimes cardboardish, but for just \\"keep awake\\" thrills, this was a worthy read.	2001-08-26

Czerneda is definitely on her way to being one of the greats of Canadian Science Fiction. Her sequel to &quot;A Thousand Words for Stranger,&quot; &quot;Ties of Power&quot; brings us back into the world of Sira Di Sarc Morgan and Jason Morgan. Sira uncovered in the previous novel that previous to her amnesia and meeting Jason she was not a terribly nice person, planning on using Jason as a tool to reach maturity in her powers, Sira's amnesia was self-inflicted as part of one of the many plots of her people, the telepathic Clan. In this book, Sira navigates the integration of her previous life with her experiences with Jason, and the character development on this track is stunning! The plot moves forward even though there's quite a bit of flashback as we explore the pasts of some characters, and all of it is in the name of character development, which is a balance done well in this novel. More, as usual, even though she introduces many new technologies and alien races, Czerneda doesn't let them over power the real strength of the tale: the characters. Enter one of the cutest/most interesting alien races I've read to date into a series already deft and intruiging, and you're in for a great read. The Clan plotting and conniving picks up a pace, and the interplay between Sira and Jason is wonderful. I, for one, can't wait for book three. 'Nathan	2001-08-24

I like Science Fiction when it presents me with interesting characters, a good deal of 'hard' science, and when the characters are not overwhelmed by the science in the plot.  Basically, I'm fussy.<br />&quot;The Left Hand of Darkness,&quot; succeeds on all counts: the narrative character is representing a multi-solar-system trade federation, the sole human on a planet where the native beings are neither male nor female, but both, only becoming of one gender for a brief period of time, when they couple to propogate.  <br />Watching the narrator, Genly Ai, navigate this world of genderless/bisexual beings was keenly interesting.  The social commentary Le Guin was submitting was there, but not so overpowering as to make you flinch at a preechy story by any means.  The machinations of the various governments on this frigid world, called Winter, were truly quite interesting, and the relationship between the narrator and one Winter native was so carefully crafted that it had a resonating gentle emotionality thoughout the novel.<br />Where the book fell apart a little was the language: there is a tendancy of the book to create tongue-twister words for things and processes that do not have a cadence that lends itself to memory.  This over-use of science fiction gobbledygook was very frustrating at times, as I had to flip back through the book to find the first time the word was used to remember what it meant.  That said, despite this small mishap, the book is a remarkable work of not just science fiction, but sociological commentary.  Like all good Science Fiction, there is more here than a tale of alien peoples, there is an extrapolation from our own society, pushed to an extreme limit to better display something not alien, but very human indeed.<br />'Nathan	2001-08-24

Sira remembers nearly nothing of who she is, only that she has a fierce feeling that human telepath Jason Morgan can keep her alive.  Running from a people she doesn't know, and finding that her time with Jason is far from unpleasant, this SF story takes a unique play on the often over-done &quot;amnesia heroine,&quot; and breathes a breath of fresh air back into the idea.<br />Sira and Jason's telepathic abilities form a core storyline to the plot, whereas their personalities and character development make it a worthwhile read.  Who suppressed Sira's memories?  The answer will definitely bring a big smile to your face, and is probably the best &quot;amnesia&quot; scenerio I've ever read!  <br />The aliens and technology don't overpower the story, nor do the telepathic abilities.  The introduction of the &quot;M'hir,&quot; a dimension where an alien race with telepathic abilities can travel from one part in the physical universe to another, is very well crafted, and has some interesting connotations for sequels in this series.<br />If you like character-driven SF, give this one a shot.<br />'Nathan	2001-08-22

The story of &quot;The Reconstruction,&quot; seems rather straightforward at first glance:  Ex-wife of doctor seeks to pull herself together after husband leaves her, and uses a reconstruction of a prehistoric human being's skelleton as a an emotional exercise.  This, however, does not do the book justice.<br />The real focus of this book is on damaged psyches - the main character, Margaret comes from a situation where her husband, a wealthy and respected man, has single-handedly destroyed her sense of self-worth.  Now, in financial ruin, she finds that her teeth are showing the decay she feels inside: they're rotting, though no fault of her own, just lousy genetics.  From there we walk with Margaret, through the metaphor of the reconstruction of a prehistoric woman who, from footprints left in fossils, walked beside a man, then hesitated for a moment before continuing.  This moment sparks something in her, and slowly, as Margaret adds to the fossilized bones, building muscle and tissue and reconstructing the woman, she reconstructs her own life, and her own self.<br />It is hard to believe that this is Casper's first work; I adored it.  This is a fine Canadian talent, and I do suggest you pick it up, especially if you're feeling a little defeated, and would like a realistic tale of &quot;reconstruction.&quot;<br />'Nathan	2001-08-21

For her creation, and maintenance, of a heroine who is not in the early years of her life, Gail Bowen deserves a lot of credit.  Joanne Kilbourn, first introduced to us in &quot;Deadly Appearances&quot; has aged with grace and style by the time we get to &quot;Burying Ariel,&quot; and this book shows no sign of her character declining.<br />Mixing in Joanne's daily life with the sudden stabbing-murder of a loved teacher on campus with ehr usual deft touch, Bowen has definitely left the pattern of every murder being tied so someone in Joanne's past (something that was starting to get a little bit hard to swallow in some of her previous books).  This murder is connected to her solely by the place Joanne works, the university, and a respect she had for the deceased.<br />Tying in radical feminists, student protests, and angry pointed fingers at a man who may have confessed - or merely said the wrong thing at the wrong time - keep the plot humming in this Kilbourn mystery.  And as always, it is the depth of character in both villains and hero(ine)s of the book that immerse you totally in what is going on.  <br />Big cheers for Gail Bowen, Canada's Lady of Mystery!<br />'Nathan	2001-08-20

The first time I read &quot;Deadly Appearances,&quot; I was struck by the fact that Joanne Kilbourn's husband had died before the series had even begun, and in a random act of violence, no less.  It was enough to raise an eyebrow, and now here, in &quot;A Colder Kind of Death,&quot; the past comes to haunt Joanne again.<br />When her husband's killer is himself killed in prison, Joanne Kilbourn picks up her Nancy Drew ways and delves into the life of her husband's life, the lives of his friends, and finds more and more things that don't add up, and secrets that might better remain in the past.  As she uncovers a conspiracy that might cast a very dark shadow on who her husband was (and even how solid their marriage was), Joanna is solid in her determination to find out the truth.<br />As always, Gail Bowen's strength is in her characters.  Joanne is a very well-written character, with solid history and plausible emotionality.  She is active and intelligent, something you rarely see in an over-forty female character, and moreover, this is done in a believable, important way.  <br />Pick this one up - though it might be best to read the Joanne Kilbourn series in order, starting with &quot;Deadly Appearances.&quot;  This is definitely one of the best in the series.<br />'Nathan	2001-08-19

While claiming to be a century of erotica, the earliest excerpt in this book is from 1969.  Despite that little misnomer, the collection itself is definately just that: a collection.  Mostly made up of excepts (and thus not catering to those of us who like our erotica with plot), this book nethertheless will likely have something in it for everyone: every style is explored here, from romantic erotica to more graphic and libidinous erotica, not to mention a very wide variety topics and &quot;scenes.&quot;<br />My one complaint would be the inclusion of so many exerpts instead of short stories.  Quite a few passages didn't quite make sense (you get the notion you're reading chapter 13 of 36, for example, in &quot;The Revolt of the Naked,&quot;) but in the collection as a whole, there's more than enough diversity to find something you like.<br />As far as erotica goes, this is a decent collection if you're looking for exactly that: the erotic passages.  If you're looking for your erotica with a plot to make it entirely stimulating, you might still enjoy some of the exerpts in here (and it's certainly worth the bargain price), but don't go in to this book expecting any sort of continuity.<br />'Nathan	2001-08-17

On that level, the book succeeded wonderfully: the tension is high, the villain stalks the heroine and a child mercilessly, and you twitch and jump and get skittish.<br />The basic premise is this:  A sociopathic pedophile has killed a childs mother and taken the child in order to prey on him better.  The child withdraws, becoming a voluntary mute, and a biter.  A woman who is an &quot;Art Therapist&quot; (a psychologist who uses the artwork of children to 'decode' their stress/troubles) then gets the boy's case, and ensuing thriller begins.<br />The heroine, Celia, is very well crafted, with depth and a personality that lines nicely with her career.  Moreover, she's not perfect - her marriage is on the rocks, she has doubts sometimes in her conclusions, and her job is unstable since the head of the hospital thinks what she does is a fraud and has no real psychological validity.   Likewise, Davy, the child, has a very rich character - he is surviving a level of awful abuse (and sometimes even the hints of what is happening to him are very painful to read), and his mind is as complex as it would be given the condition.<br />It's the villain where the complexity dies a little.  The pedophile character is cardboard and 1-dimensional, and you only get a random hint or two as to his background, motivation, or the like.  In most thrillers I've read, you get a detailed past from the villain, as he or she tries to validate what they're doing (an impossible task, but a quirk of most major sociopaths or the like).  <br />Still, on the basis of making you jump and being a solid thriller, this is a good read: you'll twitch and gasp and hold the book white-knuckled.

While Lawrence uses his usual dramatic (and excellent) flair for describing landscapes and their reflections in personality of those looking outward at them, there's a lack of direction to this story.  Even more than usual, Lawrence seems to suffer from a lack of cohesion with this story, but there's a worthy read in it anyway, for his character studies are, as always, sharp enough to draw blood.  Put literally, &quot;St. Mawr&quot; is about two women, a mother and daughter, who upon finding a fine stallion with a wildness to it, realize that that wild natural je-ne-sais-pas is missing from all the men in their lives, leading them on an interesting - if continuity flawed - pilgrimmage.<br />&quot;The Man Who Died,&quot; would get 5 stars from me on its own.  This is an incredibly well written story of an alternate telling of the 3 days that Christ was dead.  This is Christ as a human being, not a sacred figure, and as such, I can see why this story caused such a harsh discourse.  Struggling to find meaning and reason for his tortures, Christ embarks on a three day journey after waking from the dead on the very same day he was entombed.  I refuse to ruin any of the plot for you, but this retelling is magnificent, and a really in depth study of sorrow and suffering, and rebirth.  You owe yourself a read of this, even if you skip &quot;St. Mawr.&quot;<br />'Nathan	2001-08-14

Having read &quot;The Perfect Husband,&quot; and &quot;The Other Daughter,&quot; I was well ready to pick up &quot;The Third Victim,&quot; when I saw it on the shelf in my store.  I gobbled the book in a single night, and have to say that this is definitely of higher calibre writing than the other two.<br />For one, the character depth of the heroine and the villain is much more complex:  I was three-quarters of the way through the book and still unsure of who I could trust, who might be the killer, and why this was all happening.  Starting with a contemporary ugly reality: the school-shooting slaying of two students and a teacher, this book takes off from there and continues with a semi-manic pace throughout.<br />Gardner allows you into the mind of the killer without giving who the killer is away, which is a rewarding experience, but it is in Lorraine, a sherrif in the town where the shooting has happened, that the truly good writing occurs.  A woman with a somewhat shady past of her own, this shooting may be about her in some way, and it's a great ride finding out just how.<br />The only quibble I had with the book was the occasional plot wrinkle that made me blink in confusion.  There were a few passages I had to read twice to understand - not many, mind you, maybe only twice, but it did call a minor break in my reading.<br />Regardless of those minor stumbles, grab this book.  It's a thriller perfect for those of us that like a healthy mix of mystery tossed in to our edge-of-seat-reading.  <br />'Nathan	2001-08-11

The sequel to &quot;Luck in the Shadows,&quot; &quot;Stalking Darkness&quot; completes the 'Nightrunner' duet and brings you a strong fantasy novel with rich characters.  Seregil and Alec are a wonderful pair, and their relationship is both loving and special.  Kudos to Lynn Flewelling for presenting a world so rich and varied, and in writing the pair with as much wealth of personality as she did.<br />The dark plot uncovered in &quot;Luck in the Shadows,&quot; is brought to boil in this second novel, and the continuation and conclusion of it is gut-wrenching.  Prophecy, magick, and a great deal of skill is involved in this plot, and you'll enjoy the reading.  Whenever at times the story gets quite dark, there's an entertainingly light scene or two that keeps the tone from being overly sombre, but the seriousness of the tale is not sacrificed.<br />If you've enjoyed Tanya Huff, Charles De Lint, Robert Jordan, George R.R. Martin or James Clemens, give Lyn Flewelling a shot with this first duet.<br />'Nathan	2001-08-10

Tess married the perfect man: Police officer, handsome, everything she was supposed to look for in a man.  How was she to know he was a sociopath?<br />Lisa Gardner delivers a great thrill-ride with &quot;The Perfect Husband,&quot; but it is the exceptional crafting of both the villain and the heroine that win my admiration.<br />The villain, sociopath Jim Beckett, is a very well-crafted (and obviously researched) character.  His machinations - and his inside knowledge of having been a police officer - turn him into one hell of a good character: you are afraid of him, and afraid of what he can - and will - do to the rest of the cast.<br />But it is Tess, the heroine, that brings this novel to its frantic pace.  Mother of one, and not about to let her child be in danger, Tess makes the ultimate decision: the police failed to protect her once, she's going to go get outside help and learn to protect herself.  Strong-willed when she has to be, and yet not devoid of the terror she must be feeling, Gardner has given us a very plausible heroine here.  You really feel for Tess, and her reactions are human.<br />As Jim homes in on Tess, and Tess relies on a mercenary to keep her alive, the story just deepens and deepens with dramatic tension.  You'll stay awake reading this one - I did!  There's only a few foibles (one supporting character did something so insanely stupid I sat back and blinked in astonishment at the out-of-character action), but in its entirety, the book is a thrill-ride. <br />Grab this one.<br />'Nathan	2001-08-08

Starting with &quot;Wit'ch Fire,&quot; James Clemens introduced the character of Elena.  A young woman born a wit'ch (a woman with the abilties of great magicks), she is of a mixed prophecy - either the savior of the world, or its death.<br />That was the beginning of the &quot;Banned and the Banished,&quot; series.  Since then, Clemens has rounded out the cast of his books with wonderfully drawn characters: rich in elemental magics that don't overpower their characters and personalities. <br />In this third book in the series, Elena's group of friends and protectors is mostly scattered, and one of them, as told in book two, &quot;Wit'ch Storm,&quot; has been corrupted by the Dark Heart.  A very worthy read, the new characters complement the old, and we gain much more depth in the entire cast, not just Elena.  Particularly, we delve more into Kast, Sy-wen, and Joach.  This third book was definitely worth the wait, as the quality of fantasy writing has stepped up a notch.<br />A climax of sorts, this is still not the end of the series.  While part of me wonders if Clemens can keep up the pace and the exceptional writing, I'm willing to wager on it and look forward to the fourth book.<br />The only quibble is, as always, those stupid apostrophies.  Wit'ch.  D'warf.  El'vin.  Eb'onstone.  Gosh they're annoying.  It seemed, however, that they're not as prevalent as before, and mostly just repeats of the ones we've seen previously.  Perhaps Clemens has realized that they're really distracting.<br />Don't skip this book.  If you've not read Clemens before, treat yourself to the whole series.  He puts Robert Jordan to shame, and mirrors the deep characterizations of George R.R. Martin.<br />'Nathan	2001-08-06

Adopted daughter Melanie Stokes survived amnesia and abandonment - she was found in a hospital at nine years old, and adopted by a prominent family.  She grew up loved, surrounded by caring people, a brother, parents, an uncle, and everything was wonderful until the past begins to resurface in her mind.<br />&quot;The Other Daughter,&quot; is a gripping thriller from Lisa Gardner, the author of &quot;The Perfect Husband,&quot; and &quot;The Third Victim.&quot;  Melanie is placed in a horrible situation: the horrible things that are happening might very well have been done by one of the people she loves and trusts the most - but which one?  Whose love has been a lie for all of her life?  <br />Gardner ties in what seems, at first glance, to be random events in the past with this tension-laden novel.  As the plot unfolded, I found myself constantly second-guessing myself as to who was beind the deeds, which is the sign of a great thriller.  Like Melanie, I was in the dark over who to trust.  <br />Very well written, Gardner has given us a heroine who is not the &quot;Fall apart weeping&quot; type (a particular pet peeve of mine), but rather a woman who will figure out what is going on, with realistic and plausible emotional reactions.  <br />If you like a good &quot;edge-of-your-seat&quot; read, give &quot;The Other Daughter,&quot; a shot.  You won't be let down.<br />'Nathan	2001-08-03

The protagonists this time are Riker and Picard from The Next Generation, and the crew of the good ship Excalibur from Peter David's &quot;New Frontier&quot; series.<br />The plot itself - the continuation - and climax - of the viral-centric 'Double Helix' series, is quite good, but there are a few things that make one cringe a little.<br />First, Captain Calhoun undergoes a James-Bond-esque equipment scene where he gets all sorts of nifty little doodads.  It doesn't suit the rest of the series, as these devices, however they are explained as rare or unofficial, create a sort of imbalance.  Why were these devices not used in battles with the Borg, for example?  <br />Second, there is a completely useless death in this book.  While I understand the use of murder as invoking pathos, in &quot;Double or Nothing,&quot; I was just annoyed at the death of a very strong character, which served no real plot purpose at all.  It was disheartening.<br />That said, the semi-comic scenes of Riker in command of the USS Excalibur are worthy of a few chuckles, and the denoument battle is a good read.  The completist in me got this book more for the &quot;New Frontier&quot; aspect than the 'Double-Helix,' but I enjoyed it regardless.<br />'Nathan	2001-08-02

Read as such, &quot;The Holy Sinner&quot; is a disturbing account with a semi-satirical take on the religious rituals of redemption, incest, nepotism and penance.<br />On a deeper level, &quot;The Holy Sinner&quot; comes forth as a contemporary myth.  There is a definite straining in this book for a sense of redemption, forgiveness, and the search for meaning.  Ripe with symbolism, and exploring a kind of &quot;less-violent&quot; Oedipal storyline, you can feel Mann's struggle over the contemporary situation in Germany in the late 40s and early 50s.<br />Though not what I would call a &quot;sequel&quot; to &quot;Doctor Faustus,&quot; in the allegorical way you can catch a glimpse of Germany in the pages of &quot;The Holy Sinner,&quot; I would nevertheless point out that the theme of &quot;penance and change instead of murder and vengeance&quot; seems very contemporarily bound.<br />However, the story itself hinges on one coincidence too many, and there are passages that nearly grind to a halt in speed and direction.  I did come away from the novel with a new respect for Thomas Mann, but this was not an easy read, and, at times, not even enjoyable.  The alliteration and sometimes near-poetry of the writing was in some passages immaculate, and then a few pages later almost clumsy and awkward.<br />I would consider this book one meant more for study than outright enjoyment, though I did enjoy it more often than I didn't.  It was work to finish it, however, and more work to digest and attempt to understand it.  If you are in the mood for something serious and allegorical, pick up &quot;The Holy Sinner.&quot;  But if you're looking for something lighter or entertaining, I'd suggest you pass this one by.	2001-08-01

Introduced to us in &quot;Eyes,&quot; she is a psychiatrist who possesses a gift that is the epitome of &quot;mixed blessing.&quot;  She is psychic; however, clairvoyance is not a stable talent, and in &quot;Eyes,&quot; the deaths of innocents rested on her visions being misinterpreted.<br />Joseph Glass (a nom de plume for an otherwise bestselling author who I wish I could uncover) writes an excellent thriller with &quot;Blood,&quot; though it does hinge on having read &quot;Eyes&quot; first (many of the characters and plot devices wouldn't make as much sense without the first book).  The villainous serial killer in this book drains his victims of blood.  When the police are left with nothing more than the exsanguination to go upon, once again Susan is brought in with her psychicatric - and psychic - expertise.<br />Far more gorey than &quot;Eyes,&quot; (to the point at which I was somewhat nauseated once or twice), &quot;Blood&quot; nevertheless jacks up the tension a notch, and once more challenges both reader and the characters within the book.  Susan's intelligence, wit, and training, as well as her gift, are all put to task in this thriller.  The supporting characters of David Gold (Susan's police friend) and Susan's son Michael also get valuable time at the forefront, and are developing into very rich characters.<br />If you enjoy thrillers of any kind, or if, in specific, you enjoy thrillers or mysteries with a psychic touch, &quot;Blood&quot; is phenomenal.  Just be prepared for more than average amounts of gore, and try to catch a copy of &quot;Eyes,&quot; first.<br />'Nathan	2001-07-29

Alec is a young hunter's son, captured and tortured, and waiting to die when he is rescued by a strange and multifaceted man by the name of Seregil.  So begins &quot;Luck in the Shadows.&quot;<br />I fought against reading this one for a while, until a friend of mine pretty much shoved it into my hand.  I should have given in years ago, because I really loved this book's characters and story.<br />There are quite a few strengths to Lyn Flewelling's writing.  For one, we have a society that is matriarchal, or at least equalized, without the typical &quot;just reverse the roles&quot; writing.  This is not a simple society that Flewelling has written, but an intricate and interesting one.  <br />Secondly, her use of wit - not just humour - is much appreciated.  The plot is particularly dark in places, and her deft touch with an appropriate bon-mot is just what is needed to keep things light enough to be enjoyable.<br />If there are flaws, they're few, but sometimes one can tell that this is the first novel, in that scene shifting is sometimes a little bit clunky.  It is entirely forgiveable, though, and the book is one I consider a must-read of fantasy.  Be warned, however, that this is book 1 of 2, followed by &quot;Stalking Darkness,&quot; and &quot;Luck in the Shadows,&quot; will leave you unsatisfied by itself - it requires &quot;Stalking Darkness&quot; to enjoy it and to finish the tale.<br />Also, the relationship between Alec and Seregil is very sensitively written in this first book, with enough hints that you know they're going somewhere wonderful.<br />Flewelling is definately a strong new voice in fantasy, and I will follow her writing.	2001-07-28

Concentration camps, relocation programs, and the forced scattering of the people in order to dissolve their culture and heritage and disable its ability to continue were the regular practices of the day.<br />If you grew up in the Canadian educational system, likely you never heard much, if anything, about this. <br />\\"Obasan,\\" takes us into the narrative voice of Naomi, a Sansei (third generation Japanese Canadian), and her experiences of the horrible times and treatment of the Japanese Canadians. As a child of five, she saw Pearl Harbor and lived through the effects and changes it had on her life surrounded by a kind of protective silence from the adults around her. As a woman, years later, she delves back into the history of those times, and bursts the silence into the true events of Canada in World War 2.<br />\\"Obasan\\" evokes waves of empathy and pathos, and at the same time left me feeling shameful and disgusted with the Canadian government and population of that particular day. Discussion of the treatment of Canadian Japanese is both eloquent and important, and the debates between Naomi and her activist elder Aunt Emily are thought-provoking. \\"Let the dead bury the dead,\\" Naomi posits, to which Emily replies, \\"Who's dead? You're not dead.\\" <br />\\"Obasan,\\" herself is the counterpoint of this novel, the aunt that raised Naomi for most of her youth, and whose silence so protected her. There's a real beauty to this woman's struggle, and Joy Kogawa has captured it wonderfully. <br />You owe yourself a read of this book.<br />'Nathan	2001-07-27

I actually considered Captain Calhoun one of my least favorite of the &quot;New Frontier&quot; characters - but that was before reading this book.<br />Stepping inside the head of Calhoun is an interesting adventure.  Explaining Calhoun's past - the past that led him to quit Starfleet in the years prior to the events of the beginning of the &quot;New Frontier&quot; series - it puts Calhoun back in his days as the 1st Officer of the USS Grissom.<br />Calhoun's character is not as self-confident in these pages, and it suits him.  Further, you get to see a lot of his maturation as a command officer - and some explanation of his decisions as seen in the &quot;New Frontier&quot; series.  Further, there's some good information in the story that makes the character of Kat Mueller make sense once she shows up in the later books.<br />Calhoun is a strong character in this book, in that he still has some confidence issues, he's still second-guessing himself, and he's got a good deal of psychological growth left in him.  I found this book much more enjoyable for that representation of the normally ice-and-solidity Calhoun from the rest of the series.  Peter David has given us a plausible series of events that lead to the Calhoun we come to know later.<br />Give this a read if you're a &quot;New Frontier&quot; fan, it's nearly required reading for making Calhoun a plausible character.<br />'Nathan	2001-07-26

Why was she killed, if it indeed was murder?  Coupled with the exploration of the AI as a character, the grief and confusion of the murder victim's ex-husband, and a strong Science Fiction overtone, you've got a great read ahead of you.<br />With echoes of 2001, &quot;The Golden Fleece,&quot; reads somewhat straightforwardly at times, but it still a remarkably entertaining book from the Canadian master of SF.<br />'Nathan	2001-07-21

I'll admit that I only picked up &quot;Infinity's Child&quot; because it was on the bargain books pile, but when it came time to sit down and read the book, I was quite enraptured.<br />First off, Stein has written a strong heroine in Sally Benedict.  Finally pregnant after a very long time trying, Sally is the editor of a local newspaper in a small town.  When graves start to turn up violated - and Sally tracks down that all those graves belong to one family line - her own - things go for a macabre spin pretty quickly.  The plot isn't trite - nor are you left totally in the dark.  It's a delicate balance to teeter on the edge of having no clue and having just enough clues to jack up the tension, but Stein does it right.  This is not a deep novel, but it's full of good thrills.<br />Sally's husband, Sally herself, and the villains of this book make it a very worthwhile read.  It's a &quot;turn the lights on and cover yourself with a blanket,&quot; sort of read, and if you enjoyed Ann Werner's &quot;The People Next Door,&quot; (or another thriller with a fantastic heroine) you'll definately like this one!<br />'Nathan	2001-07-20

There, we meet Ernest, a bitter man and the farmer-father of the family.  His wife has died, leaving behind two sisters: Lucinda, literally the treasured one, and Norma Joyce, our heroine of the story, blunt and somewhat odd.<br />When a student of weather arrives at their home, both Lucinda and Norma Joyce tumble into a love for him, and the story begins there.<br />Norma Joyce is a wonderful character, and her character is often both a joy and hurtful to read.  There is an extreme level of pathos and empathy to this work, and all of it important.  The story meanders from Saskatchewan to Ottawa and even to New York as we follow Norma Joyce, and as the secrets of her family are uncovered, and her deceits and kindesses are explored, we find a woman of remarkable iron strength.  <br />For myself, the benchmark of a good solid work of literature will always be a strong character base, and &quot;A Student of Weather&quot; definately has that.  Between the Hardys, and the student of weather, Maurice Dove, for which the novel is named, there are no weak characters here.  I've re-read my copy a few times, and still find something new to its pages.<br />If you are at all a fan of recent-historical fiction, or simply a lover of strong characters, especially strong women, then this is a book for you.

I got hooked with &quot;Factoring Humanity,&quot; sailed right through &quot;Flashforward,&quot; &quot;Starplex,&quot; and &quot;Calculating God,&quot; then stumbled a bit with &quot;Illegal Alien.&quot; Then I read &quot;The Terminal Experiment.&quot;<br />I do like this book. It had some good strong characters, and had the usual Sawyer multiplot setup. When a man develops a machine capable of viewing the soul's release after death, the world changes overnight. The philosophical ramifications of this device have its creator wondering about what happens to the soul once it has left the body, and he produces an AI experiment: he creates three copies of his own mind to exist in cyberspace: one with no memory of physical existance (to simulate life after death), one with no knowledge of aging or mortality (to simulate immortality), and one unmodified, as a sort of scientific &quot;control.&quot; <br />Then, people with whom Hobson has 'personality conflicts' start showing up dead, and it seems that all three Hobson-AIs have escaped their cybernetic boxes. One of them is a killer.<br />Weaving multiple plots together is usually a forte of Sawyer, but in &quot;The Terminal Experiment,&quot; it's not so tightly woven. The plots of the family troubles of Hobson, against the &quot;soul-wave&quot; device, and the murder mystery, don't always link together as tightly as they could. Still, I quite enjoyed his book, as always, and if nothing else, the philosophical debates of the three AIs, and what they represent, was a real thought-provoker. <br />If you're new to Sawyer, start with something else, such as &quot;Flashforward&quot; or &quot;Factoring Humanity&quot; or &quot;Calculating God.&quot; If you've read him before, be prepared for a stylistically weaker plot, but a good read nonetheless.<br />'Nathan	2001-07-16

Sawyer has a really tight grip on humankind's foibles.  In &quot;Factoring Humanity,&quot; we step into a world where, in 2007, a signal has finally been coming back from the stars.  This signal, which has been coming for years, has become so commonplace, and is still undeciphered after so long, therefore humanity is pretty much bored with it.  How very human.  <br />Strong view of humanity's short attention span aside, in &quot;Factoring Humanity&quot; the signal is finally deciphered by one Heather Davis, whose family life is falling to pieces (one of her daughters has committed suicide, and her marriage is nearly destroyed).  When she discovers what this signal means, she is left with a knowledge that allows her to do some extraordinary thigns - and yet, in a very human way, this heroine doesn't go save the world, she takes a step inward to try and save her family.<br />This is Sawyer at his best: his usual multiple-level story, with an exceptional character base, some good philosophy (Carl Jung's collective unconscious features in &quot;Factoring Humanity&quot; quite centrally), a potential murder, the troubles of advanced technology, and above it all, looming, the notion that we're not alone after all - and are we about to meet friends, or enemies?<br />I reccommend Sawyer regardless of which title you pick up, but if one of those titles happens to be &quot;Factoring Humanity,&quot; &quot;Flashforward&quot; or &quot;Calculating God,&quot; then you're in the top-three of his calibre.  Whatever few foibles are in this particular novel, they're just that: few, and not enough to derail the story.  There's some great in-character exploration of the alien knowledge, and the story itself makes one think.<br />'Nathan	2001-07-16

Artificially generated, these tunnels allowed transport from one part of space to areas light-years away.  Their creators are unknown.<br />In Sawyer's &quot;Starplex,&quot; a human and alien crew set out to explore the wormholes, finds that something is coming through the wormhole back to meet them.  The age of discovery may be over, and it may be war.<br />As always, Sawyer's characters are the strength of this work.  Kieth Lansing comes alive on the page, and internal struggles against bigotry and other human failings are sharp enough to draw blood.  The alien races are very well developed, especially the &quot;Ibs,&quot; (Integrated beings, of which individuals are made up of various living organisms that bond symbiotically).<br />What I could have done without, however, was the Dolphins.  Over-cute and just a little out of place in this novel, we find that Dolphins have always been intelligent, and it just took us a while to clue in.  It's somewhat clunky.<br />The plot itself is well thought out and puts the notion of an Alien &quot;Culture Clash&quot; to new heights.  The scientific mysteries of the story also set a high simmer, and the outcomes of the various interwoven plots (another strength of Sawyer) are all very satisfying.<br />Though the inclusion of the dolphins made me wince, I'd still reccommend this one with no real regrets.  It's enjoyable, the characters are solid, and the plot is formidable.  Canada's king of SF does it again.<br />'Nathan	2001-07-15

Now, by that, I don't mean I didn't like it.  In fact, it had some of the best written aliens to come from his pen, and had great human characters that I found well characterized and plausible.<br />The concept is fairly simple:  Aliens land on earth, they tour around, become celebrities, and then someone who had close contact with the aliens is found murdered, and prime suspect number one is one of the aliens.  Hence, a trial.<br />The notion of putting aliens on trial was very good, and the idea was kept rather sound.  The science of the alien physiology was very well crafted into the story (especially the concept of using alien DNA typing in the trial).<br />Then, enter OJ Simpson.  No, not as a character, obviously, but as reference after reference.  This book got bogged down in the OJ references, which, given when the book was written, would have been fine, but reading it now made it clunky and a little bit out-of-date.  Making a contemporary reference or two is usually fair play, but the reliance on OJ metaphors was just overdone, and this book will likely suffer more from it as time goes by.<br />Still, in and of itself, there is a good plot here - not just for those of you interested in the legalities, but of alien cultures and physiologies - not to mention a good ol' fashioned murder mystery!  The twist at the end is another Sawyer great, and as long as you can get past the OJ stuff, it's worth your while. <br />'Nathan	2001-07-13

Forward has written an absolutely wonderful account of an alien life that simply has not been done as well as this in any other SF book I've read.<br />To set the tone, picture a neutron star.  This is simply one of the most hostile astronomical bodies out there, something that man can orbit only with the most sophisticated equipment and technology, but from which man could learn a lot about the universe.  So, when one such star is within reach of a human spacecraft, we go.<br />And find life on the surface of the star.<br />In dealing with the development of the alien race, the Cheela, Forward has crafted a magnificent piece of SF.  It's unfortunate that the sophistication that he shows in regards to these aliens doesn't quite shine through with the human characters in the story.  Often the humans come off flat and a little less then interesting, but this is completely overshadowed by the Cheela.  Playing with notions of relative time, alien forms of perception, and with a SF ending that puts most other &quot;alient contact&quot; books to shame, &quot;Dragon's Egg&quot; is required reading for any fan of SF.<br />'Nathan	2001-07-13

His struggle with his own genetic future is centre stage in this story.<br />But woven into this tale is a woman who can read minds, Molly.  Though a genetic quirk of fate, her ability puts her in the forefront of a potential murder, and the story picks up steam from there.<br />Evolution, genetics, Nazi experimentation, murder, and a whole stream of incredibly rich plotlines cumulate into one great showdown of SF writing.  As always, Sawyer's strong characterizaitons and his respect for science shine through, and I was gripped right to the end.<br />Give this a shot, you won't regret it.<br />'Nathan	2001-07-13

I wish I'd gone to it earlier than now.<br />Despite a somewhat slow start (the only real negative thing I can say about the book), &quot;Hotel Paradiso&quot; is a rather unique reading experience.  David, our main narrative voice, has come to Pigeon Cay to get away from the rotten relationship and rat race that Montreal represents.  In Pigeon Cay, he is running the only bank on the island in a world where drug running, back-room dealings, and white-collar crime walk hand in hand with racism, beatings, murders and voodoo.<br />The book, however, reads nearly lyrically.  The passages where David describes the slow pace of the world around him are nearly meditative, and when the action begins, it garners your attention all the more for the sharp change of pacing.  The myriad plots and deals and secrets of Pigeon Cay are a marvel to unravel, and definately a worthwhile reading endeavour.<br />Despite the slow beginning, I'd definately reccommend this one.  And, as always, it's a pleasure to read strong writing from a Canadian author.<br />'Nathan	2001-07-11

It is with some trepidation that I try to sit down and write this review.  It's one thing to say that this is likely one of the top five books I have read in my life so far, but it's another thing to try and qualify that thereafter.  This book, however, has earned the attempt at least.<br />A botched circumcision left two very slightly educated parents with an impossible decision: what to do?  They'd brought their twin sons in for what they considered the most routine of operations, and now the doctor was reccommending removing the burned and destroyed penis and raising the boy as a girl.<br />This is his story, in his words, and let me tell you, it was a story that moved me from sympathy, to empathy, to outright rage, and sheer incredulity.  You cannot help but feel deeply when reading this book: anger at the selfish self-interest motivated doctor who tried to use this poor victimized child to prove his theories - at whatever the cost.  Admiration on behalf of the child who had to grow up this way.  Pain and Empathy for the parents, faced with the then contemporary impossibility of &quot;disagreeing&quot; with a doctor.<br />That David came forth with this novel just stuns me, and I have nothing but admiration for a man who could survive all this.  His story deserves to be read, and is one of the few people I can think of when I hear the phrase &quot;contemporary hero.&quot;  Not for mere survival (of which there is nothing mere), but in his handling of the situation, and his rising to the challenge, and, most importantly, his attitudes he has adopted since.	2001-07-11

This particular &quot;episode&quot; of the New Frontier series focuses very much on the ties of family.  While Robin Lefler and her mother attempt to &quot;reconnect&quot; on Risa, Burgoyne and Selar struggle with what their roles should be in regards to Xyon, their son.<br />The most interesting (and often moving) passages of this book revolve around the relationship between Selar and Xyon (and, to a degree, Burgoyne).  While Lefler's life always adds a bit of comic relief (I swear, she's written like the bad-luck faerie), it wasn't so over-the-top this time, and her constant talking to herself didn't come off as forced in this book.  Likely, this is because I've gotten used to her character now, and she just seems to be acting normally.<br />There is a lot of good stuff about Vulcan culture and their passions (anti-passions?) and Burgoyne's navigation through Vulcan culture is a must-read, as is Selar's &quot;Logical&quot; conclusions on how Xyon should be raised.  <br />Now, the quibbles I have with this book are the cameos.  I imagine I was likely one of the only people who didn't like the TNG Episode &quot;Relics,&quot; so you can imagine how flat the entrance of Scotty was into this book for me.  Spock also makes an appearance, as does T'Pau.  It was a bit much.  Any one of them would have been okay.<br />You will not regret this book, but gosh will you hate the cliffhanger (yet again).	2001-07-11

An alien arrives in Earth's not-too-distant future, and says, &quot;Take me to your paleontologist.&quot;  It's as if the alien doesn't know its line...<br />But it does.  This alien has arrived to tell humanity that on similar timeframes all of the major civilizations it has encountered so far have had the major evolutionary disasters (ie: when the Dinosaurs were wiped out, similar evolutionary extinctions happened on other planets in parallel).  Therefore, the alien points out, a higher intelligence - God - must exist.<br />The main character of this book, a paleontologist, begs to differ.<br />This book is science fiction at its best.  There is a scientific tone to the tale itself, but the story is more an extrapolation of philosophies and diverse viewpoints.  As the plot with the paleontologist becomes more heart-wrenching (and let me tell you, folks, when Robert Sawyer decides to jerk your heart-strings, he does it with great aplomb), and as the alien characters become just that: incredible characters, you'll find yourself slipping, as I did, into the book.<br />I didn't put it down.  I picked it up, began to read, and didn't stop until I was finished, losing an entire evening to this fabulous blend of science fiction and philosophy.  This is a style Sawyer does well: in &quot;Flashforward,&quot; we debated free will, and in &quot;Calculating God,&quot; we debate a higher order of intelligence.  <br />Get this, read it, and you too will fall into fandom of Canada's best SF Author.<br />'Nathan	2001-07-11

New Frontier fans are in for something better this time around on the New Frontier novels.  &quot;Quiet Place&quot; was a bit weak in places, but the follow-up, &quot;Dark Allies,&quot; is much more on par with Peter David's earlier works.<br />The Redeemers, the greatest enemy that the Excalibur crew have faced so far, come to Calhoun with a request to save their people.  Caught in the impossible decision, &quot;Dark Allies&quot; plays quite a bit on the notion of a moral decision, and brings us a space-born entity that reminds us of the Amoeba and the Crystalline Entity.<br />The real joy of this book, however, is a return to the characters of the Excalibur.  Everyone gets a little time - it's more of a troupe novel than one that focuses on any one character, and it is quite a good read on that front.  There is something a bit overdone in the romantic entangles of this book, and one hopes that they'll start to unravel soon, before the good ship Excalibur starts to come off like a soap opera.  Exploring Si Cwan's sister and Captain Calhoun's son was also some well-written prose and character.<br />What does frustrate is yet another cliffhanger ending, likely the biggest one yet, which will drive you nuts.  Those few minor quibbles aside, this book itself was definately worth the read.	2001-07-09

I waffled a bit over whether to give this one 3 or 4 stars.  I finally went with 4 on the strength of the Soleta plot.<br />To start at the beginning, Peter David created a series called &quot;New Frontier.&quot;  An alien captain, three characters who were cameo's on The Next Generation, and the rest of the crew made up from his fertile imagination.  They are put aboard the USS Excalibur, and sent into Thallonian space.<br />In book eight, the last line of the story takes us, with no explanation, to &quot;five minutes before the Excalibur blew up.&quot;<br />Ack.<br />The first foible of this book is the very manipulative way we are kept out of the loop as to what happened to the USS Excalibur, and further, Captain Calhoun specifically.  <br />The second foible is that the crew scatters, which is fine, but the B-story of McHenry and Kebron, despite revealing some really interesting and tantalizing tidbits about McHenry, read like a joke.  A bad joke.  X-Files meets a Circus Act.<br />For all that those two are two major concerns, the plot with Soleta exploring her mixed racial history was just phenomenal.  The amount of intruigue that Peter David managed to slide between only about a third of the book was just a treasure to read.  If the book had focused entirely on Soleta, I would have been a happy man.  Instead, the more awkward bits with Kebron and McHenry had me groaning, and I was tempted to skip passages (but didn't).<br />Still, exploring a crew in their &quot;downtime&quot; is a new side to the Star Trek universe we've not really seen explored often, aside from the occasional Risa episode of DS9 and TNG.  This was handled rather well.<br />A must-read for Soleta, but otherwise, just a fair book.	2001-07-09

It is unfortunate, however, that you don't really find out who these people are until a good portion of the book has gone by.<br />When it does touch on the characters we've grown to love on the USS Excalibur, &quot;The Quiet Place&quot; is very much about Si Cwan, the enigmatic Thallonian who survived the fall of the Thallonian Empire, and Captain Calhoun.  Shelby gets a bit of the stage as well, mostly in relation to Calhoun.<br />Once I was aboard the Excalibur, I was happy again, but too much of this story was the &quot;set-up&quot; for the rest of it, and I was bored enough that I put it down quite often at the beginning.  Still, the ending redeems it, the new plot wrinkles are definitely good ones, and with patience, the book pays off.	2001-07-08

It's beautifully illustrated, with lavish full-colour references to myth, symbol, rite, and the famous faces of Wicca.<br />That said, as far as the content goes, it's quite light.  The very basics are in here, and in that, it is a suitable beginners book, but with so many other introductory books out there that better describe the faith of Wicca, this one ends up being a little short.<br />Focusing on a Gardnerian path of Wicca, the book explores initiation rites, covens, the history of Wicca, sabbat rites, the elements and gods and goddesses, among many other subtopics.  Rituals are given a chapter of their own, and a final chapter explores Wicca in the 21st Century.  There's a suggested reading list, which is a good thing.<br />The book is okay, and the information in it is also okay - it's just not very in depth.  If there'd been a tacked on &quot;Introductory&quot; somewhere in the title, I'd have ranked it higher.  That said, this is a great book to put in the hands of someone who doesn't know what you mean when you say you are Wiccan, though if you're not Gardenerian, it'd be a little misleading.  The niche for this book is for people who want to learn a little about the faith, so I see it best used in the hands of those who are related to or friends of Wiccans, and who wish to learn a little bit more.	2001-07-08

As a fan of Canadian literature and authors, I picked up Peter Hogg's &quot;Crimes of War&quot; with a bit of hesitation.  Previous to this book, it had been my experience that the 'Nazis' of fiction tend to come off as one-dimensional, with nearly no thought behind them: cardboard villains.<br />This was not the case in &quot;Crimes of War.&quot;  Hogg has put a monumental amount of thought and effort into making this book not only enjoyable, but emotionally stirring.  The main character, like Hogg himself once did, works in the special division of the Canadian Government that tracks down escaped world war II criminals in Canada.  <br />Time, however, has made this government office obsolete.  The Nazis are dying of old age, and, worse, so are the victims who could identify them even if they were arrested.  The office is being closed, and Hogg's protagonist, Dennis Connor, has the distinctly unpleasant duty of being the last one there to shut it down, lock the door, and leave the keys behind.<br />But first, there is one more criminal he knows has escaped into Canada: Reile.  <br />Alternating between the view of the war criminal, the protagonist, and dancing between the present and the past, this book is highly evocative.  There is a real humanization of the Nazi who is old aged and ailing, and hiding in Canada.  Hogg's novel dares to explore what the mass murderers of world war two were like on an individual level - and without pulling punches: Riele is not an apparent monster.  <br />As the back of the book says, &quot;Does it makes sense to pursue old men in their seventies or eighties for what they did, under orders, in the tumoil of war in Europe fifty years earlier?&quot;  &quot;How can the forces of justive ignore mass murderers among us, regardless of how much time has elapsed since they killed their last child?&quot;<br />The questions, and the book's characters, are disturbing, and dead-on accurate.  This is not a light read, nor an easy one, but a veryrewarding one.  I promise you'll put &quot;Crimes of War&quot; down with many new thoughts.	2001-07-07

While the book does indeed explore these often fun and always colourful parts of the culture of Quebec, Grescoe has a lot more depth here than is readily apparent.  Though sometimes he gets a little long-winded, Taras Grescoe has put together a diatribe of note in &quot;Sacre Blues.&quot;<br />More than just these fun facts (Such as where the nickname &quot;Pepsis&quot; came from, or just what the heck &quot;Poutine&quot; is all about), Grescoe gives the amateur reader a quick, and remarkably objective, overview of the Quebec history, and touches upon some of the most major issues to the francophone society.  Everything is on display for Grescoe to discuss with grace, and not a little wit, from the sometimes hypocritical cry for being recognized as a &quot;distinct society,&quot; to the treatment of its own provincial heroes (can we say anything negative about &quot;Celine Dion&quot; within the Quebec borders without fearing for our lives?).<br />An A to Z of Quebec (and literally, in one chapter, Grescoe does an A to Z of Quebec), this book is perfect reading for anyone who hasn't touched on Quebec before, but finds the enigmatic province of interest.  This is not an anti-Quebec book, and it becomes readily apparent that Grescoe feels that without Quebec, Canada just wouldn't be Canada.  It's an interesting point of view, and one he illustrates, and supports, quite well.	2001-07-07

I had the distinct pleasure of meeting Karen Irving when she came into my store for a signing.  Appropriately in awe of standing near an author, I managed to mumble something likely incoherent, and yet she signed my book for me anyway.<br />I went home, turned on the kettle, and started to read &quot;Pluto Rising.&quot;<br />First off, the notion of an Astrologer as the main character in a mystery novel intruigues.  Done as well as Irving did, the astrologer leaps out of the page with sarcastic aplomb, and leaves you laughing.  The wit in this book is wonderful, and quite surprising for a first novel.<br />Second, the plot itself was a keeper.  Katy, our intrepid ex-psychologiest and now struggling astrologer, has a brief meeting with a man who wants his chart done, a man who seems quite scared and fragile.  The same man then shows up dead.<br />Unable to stop herself, Katy Klein begins to Nancy Drew her way around the case, and let me tell you, her motivations are quite clear and her emotional responses are very human.  Irving has a real flair for this character.<br />I've since read &quot;Jupiter's Daughter,&quot; the second novel in the Katy Klein series, and this is a series I will definately follow.  Both books are a strong read with a good mysery and - most importantly - a strong character base.  Pick them up today, you won't be let down.	2001-07-07

I absolutely loved &quot;The Ivory and the Horn,&quot; &quot;Memory and Dream,&quot; and &quot;Dreams Underfoot,&quot; and as a result, I scooped up a copy of &quot;Moonlight and Vines&quot; as soon as I saw it.  <br />In as much as this is a collection of Newford stories, it was another wonderful collection of the urban fantasy that lovers of DeLint flock to.  Newford is a city where dreams can walk the streets, where the past and present can touch in rainstorms, and where graveyards can be the sanctuary for lost youth and innocence given form.  This is a world where magic walks hand in hand with the reality of a city, in all its glory - and its uncaring.<br />On a more personal note, I found that the Newford stories in &quot;Moonlight and Vines&quot; grew up.  Not in a sense that these stories are about harder topics than previous books - for DeLint has not been shy about touching upon such difficult issues as child abuse, addiction, and the like.  What I found was that the stories in this book more often figured older adults, not those on the edge of teenage years or the mid-late twenties, and also that the reappearance of the usual cast of characters (Jilly Coppercorn, for example) was not as prevalent in this collection.  <br />All in all, I loved it.  I re-read all my Newford books, and it was only with slight regret that I didn't find Jilly and the others in this book as often as I'd like.  Pick this up, (heck, pick all the Newford books up)!  Canada's master of fantasy strikes again.<br />'Nathan	2001-07-06

Once again, he proves that well-written characters are the real power behind the Star Trek universe, and &quot;New Frontier&quot; has definately earned its place therein.<br />You will not be disappointed by this series.	2001-07-06

Set in Atlantic Canada, we find ourselves walking alongside Kit, the heroine of the story, through her often difficult life.<br />Raised mostly by her grandmother, with a mother who is developmentally delayed, Kit struggles hard in the small town world to remain independant and strong.  When her grandmother dies, Kit's life becomes entangled with the local populace as she suddenly becomes parent to her mother and tries frantically to navigate the world of growing up, falling in love, and learning of her own confused past.<br />An ultimately triumphant novel, Kit is an incredible character that earns sympathy and empathy alike.  The vivid prose that Morrissey uses to describe the Canadian countryside is just phenomenal, and the characterizations of the townsfolk are so sharp they draw blood.  I have re-read this book on many occassions, and still find something new within its pages, the true test of a really wonderful read.<br />If you like Alice Hoffman, Joyce Carol Oates, or have ever read one of the Oprah's Choice books about a strong female character overcoming nearly impossible environments and life experiences, then this book is for you.	2001-07-05

This is not just a collection of the various tales we've all heard in one form or another.  &quot;Folk and Fairy Tales,&quot; edited by Hallett and Karasek, delves into these tales with a running commentary on the notion of the oral tradition, cultural reference points that explain some of the overtones, and a careful examination of various forms of the same folk or fairy tale, with which their theories and discussions become clear.  Broken down into sensible categories (&quot;Sleeping Beauties,&quot; &quot;Brain over Brawn,&quot; &quot;The Child as Hero,&quot; for a few examples), the tales blend wonderfully with each other, and act as counterpoints to both the theories and the collection as a whole.<br />What might also be overlooked upon the first reading of this book are the incredible essays included as an almost-appendix to the collection.  Tolkein and Bettelheim make up two of the half-dozen articles, and they are a very enlightening read for the student of folk lore and the amateur reader both.<br />I would never have come across this book were it not for my 'Mythology and Symbolism' course in university, and I still find myself returning to it now and again when my nephew declares that he wishes a particular fairy tale be read.  <br />If you have even the slightest interest in fairy tales, you will likely find a few new versions of tales you thought you knew within the pages of this book.  If you are interested in fairy tales on an academic level, this book could prove to be an invaluable resource for you.  <br />'Nathan	2001-07-05

Picking up where the original four mini-book releases left off, Peter David gives us the first full-length Star Trek: New Frontier book with &quot;Martyr.&quot;<br />I really enjoyed the results.  The main plotline of the book, the A-Story, is that of the ship encountering a world where Captian Mackenzie Calhoun has been 'recognized' as the 'Savior,' of their prophecies.  With some interesting diatribes on the notions of faith and spirituality, the book would have been a bit heavy and a lot less 'fun' than the other books without the B-Story: Dr. Selar, still in the throws of her Pon Farr.<br />The story reveals more tantalizing tid-bits of the characters assembled mostly from the mind of Peter David, and even those characters we already know gain a bit more depth (especially the aforementioned Dr. Selar).  Peter David once again proves that the characters of the Star Trek world do not need a screenplay to stand on their own, and, indeed, be quite interesting in their own right.<br />This one definately ends with something that makes you want to keep going, and I picked up Book Six the day I finished Book Five.	2001-07-04

On the surface, &quot;The Sibyl&quot; seems to be a decent enough myth about a man who was cursed by Christ for a show of inhospitality, and his approaching an ex-prophetess of Apollo on a mountainside overlooking Delphi.<br />This book, however, delves into the mythological implications of the human being searching for meaning in a world where gods, or God, allows pain and evil to exist.  The characters have no names, a feature often found in cosmological and mystical myths to help the reader &quot;step into&quot; the roles found therein.  A truly moving account of the pains of being not just called, but Chosen, and of ultimately finding a place for onesself in an often harsh world.<br />Written in 1956, &quot;The Sibyl&quot; is full of the sense of confusion and loss of the post war era, and Lagerkvist's own, often pessimistic, philosophical debates on the nature of man's significance.  <br />There are some truly rewarding passages in this book, though one of the easy pitfalls is to assume any mention of &quot;god&quot; refers to the Judeau-Christian God, when often the reference is to Apollo, a contextual reference point for the use of one of the more famous Sibyls of history.  The myth is ancient, but Par Lagerkvist's retelling is contemporarily bound - and the questions asked are both very old and still presently unanswered.	2001-07-04

From the man who brought us &quot;Q in Law,&quot; and the &quot;Imzadi&quot; books, comes &quot;The New Frontier.&quot;  Given command of the USS Excalibur, recently repaired, we are introduced to a new crew and a very new captain, Captain Mackenzie Calhoun, a Xenexian who led his people to freedom as a young rebel leader.  <br />The only downside to this book (or rather, these books) is that the story of Calhoun's past drags a little in the telling.<br />Calhoun reads very much as a cowboy, which suits a series set on a new frontier where they are very much the only federation presence, and an ancient and powerful empire is crumbling to dust, and anarchy is the rule of the sector.<br />Peter David drafts some great characters who cameod on Star Trek The Next Generation, and adds them to his own crew.  The familiar faces include Robin Lefler, Dr. Selar, and - best of all - Shelby.  Teamed up with a hermaphroditic engineer named Burgoyne (any resemblance to my last name is a total fluke), a strange seemingly-savant navigator named McHenry, a tactical officer who is a walking mountain named Kebron, and a half-romulan, half-vulcan science officer, Soleta, you'll find the Excalibur crew to be as amazing as I did.<br />These first four mini-books, collected into one volume, charts Calhoun's past, and the first mission of the USS Excalibur into what was once Thallonian space.  Calhoun's past is out to kill him, and the growing pains of a new crew definately sets a good pace.<br />Oh, and did I mention that Calhoun and Shelby were once lovers?<br />Grab this one - it's a great read.	2001-07-03

At the end of book eight in the New Frontier series by Peter David, we learn that the Excalibur was destroyed.  In books nine and ten, the reason it blew up is never mentioned, and we followed the path of the surviving crewmembers.  The only casualty, we were told, was Captain Mackenzie Calhoun.  Leaving a distraught Commander Shelby behind in book nine, we finally pick up on her tale here, in &quot;Restoration.&quot;<br />As was obvious to all of us reading the series, Calhoun is not dead, and while he lives through a very Clint Eastwood-esque adventure on the planet where he crashed, we parallel Shelby's promotion to Captain, and her first command: the USS Exeter.<br />Something I found rather interesting to note was that Shelby decided upon forming a very straight-laced, by-the-book command crew, and - drumroll please - they were all human.  I sometimes get a little frustrated at Peter David's over-use of aliens, but this was a nice parallel, and drew the point home that the USS Excalibur was definately made up of the more &quot;oddballish&quot; officers of Starfleet.<br />As Shelby learns that the rules are indeed meant to be bent (or broken), much to the chagrin of her new staff, and she puts Mackenzie Calhoun to rest in her heart, we follow Calhoun as he strives to find a way off a low-tech planet where he has been given a rather difficult role: a lawman.  <br />All in all, this was a great enty in the New Frontier books, and I can't wait for the next in the series (I'm rather hoping there's a Section 31 book coming out for the New Frontier books, as they did in all the other series).  It was also interesting to read the conclusion of Lt. JG Robin Lefler's (mis)adventure from book ten.<br />Once again, Peter David has proven that his characters in the Star Trek world have more than enough power on their own, despite having never been seen on screen, and definately deserve their place on the Star Trek shelf.<br />The conclusion of this book will have you doinga jig in your seat, and the only thing I can really say is: More!	2001-07-03

What a wonderful book this is.  As a pagan, the amount of &quot;Christmas&quot; that is all around tends to frustrate me during the Yule season, and there's some great folklore and ritual to be found in these pages.<br />Last year I bought this book about a month before Yule occurred, and this book was invaluable.  I usually manage to have a few friends over for Yule dinner on the 23rd, and this book turned it into an experience that all of them passed positive comments on.  From the neat little touches of decoration, to the rituals and prayers and party games, this book is just stuffed with fantastic bits and pieces to make any wiccan or pagan Yule a blast!<br />The discussion of the history of Yule, as well as the commonalities of Yule with the various December/January holidays that parallel with it across the globe, is quite interesting, and I found myself just sitting with a cup of tea and reading the book cover to cover.  I packed it away with my Yule decorations, knowing that it will be right on top when I open the box next year.	2001-07-02

Before I begin, I should point out that I have read and loved the entire Jo Anne Kilbourn mystery series, and that this first book is the only one I have any solid troubles with.<br />Jo Anne Kilbourn is a wonderful character, a woman who can't seem to not get involved when a man she worked with in Canadian Politics is murdered by poison in front of a crowd, herself included.  Digging into the past of the politician, however, she unearths that all might not be how it seemed, and soon wonders how many people she can trust that she has trusted her entire adult life.<br />A character with a solid family, Jo Anne is a bright and interesting widower, and a smart amateur sleuth to boot.  On that basis alone, this was a pleasure to read.<br />The pleasure ends with the villain.  I don't want to give the book away, but who the villain is and and the villain's motive for murder set my teeth on edge.  .... It's tiring, insulting, and done far too often in fiction.<br />That said, the rest of the book propelled me forward in the Jo Anne Kilbourn series, and I have loved the rest dearly, right up to &quot;Burying Ariel.&quot;<br />Check it out, just get ready to flinch, in a bad way, at the villain.	2001-07-02

In &quot;Home from the Vinyl Cafe,&quot; Stuart McLean gives us a rousing journey of one year in the life of Dave, Morley, Sam and Stephanie.  From one Christmas to the next, we step in an check up on the family a few times each season, with such fantastic stories as &quot;Dave Cooks the Turkey,&quot;  and &quot;School Days.&quot;  Rousing, amusing and touching in turn, McLean's tales are as much a joy to read as they are to listen to. <br />Now, if you have no idea who I'm talking about, you're in for a real treat.  Stuart McLean is a humourist who speaks on the radio twice a week with his wonderful Canadian prose short narratives, which always manage to make me laugh out loud.

Hamilton's 'Anita Blake' series is that the characters, no matter how hard the situation, act out upon their world as much as it acts at them.  Faced with troubles, Anita Blake and her companions find a way to turn the tide, or to react to the troubles with their usual skill, and more importantly, style.<br />Not so in this new series.  Meredith Gentry seems like she'll be an interesting character at the start, and the set up of her as a Private Investigator in a company where the workers are in some ways of fairy blood is quite striking.  A case is introduced, and then everything goes poorly from there.<br />Merry seems to be written as a reactive character.  She never seems to do anything, only to react to what is done to her - she's tossed along this story like a feather in a whirlwind.  Granted, she admits it - constantly Merry bemoans that she is a very weak fairie compared to the rest - but it gets to be too much.<br />Add to that that every other chapter involves some sort of S&amp;M sex scene, many of which don't seem to be thematically or narratively necessary (or even important), and you'll get an idea of why this book did nothing for me.  I'm not sure if anyone could manage to eroticize the eating of flesh and the drinking of blood, but Laurel K. Hamilton tried in &quot;Kiss of Shadows,&quot; and it sure didn't work for me (unless the point was to nauseate).<br />I will not be following the rest of this series, it is simply too weak in my opinion.  If you're looking for Anita Blake, she's not here.  Merry is barely a shadow of the things that we love in Anita, no pun intended.	2001-07-02

I can't remember who it was that handed me &quot;Tales of the City.&quot;  The first in what I thought was a trilogy (but is actually part of a sextet), I was surprised to learn that the book was actually a collection of a once serially printed story.  <br />The characters are a delight, and there's something in here for everyone, not just members of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered community.  From Michael's quest for love, to Mary-Anne's journey to independance, these characters face life and death together on all its myriad fronts.  Set in the San Francisco of the wild seventies, this book can be an interesting romp of nostalgia for many, or a wonderful peek into the past for those of us who were there, but in diapers, at the time.<br />The only word of warning I add to my otherwise hands-down reccommendation of &quot;Tales of the City,&quot; is that its once serial nature makes it seem to jump and skip at the start, until you are used to the characters and have a feel for their personalities.  Once you've got them down, it's a wonderful read, and you'll catch yourself pining for the next one, &quot;More Tales from the City.&quot;	2001-07-02

When I first saw this book, I thought, &quot;Gosh, a meteor hitting the world.  How fresh and new,&quot; and then rolled my eyes.  It took me a second to clue in that the meteor was impacting the moon, not the Earth.  At which point I thought, &quot;Well, slightly different, but still likely to be pretty similar.&quot;<br />This wasn't the case.  First off, Jack McDevitt's strength lies in his characters.  There are a wonderful range of characters in this book, and you don't have a clue who will survive.  That's another strength: the plot is not predictable, and the mortality rate is plausible given what is going on.  <br />Set slightly ahead in the future, man has finally opened a base on the moon - just in time for the moon to be in the way of a high-speed meteor.  Spotted by accident by an amateur astronomer (one of the only overdone &quot;Seen-it-before&quot; moments of the book), there's a kind of panic pace to the first half of the novel as the people of the moon try desperately to get back to earth and the orbital stations that support the colony.<br />The second half of the book deals with the fallout - having the moon shattered is even worse than the single meteor, as now the shards of the moon are threatening to fall from the sky...<br />Throughout this high-paced background however, it is the characters who shine through this novel.  It was the first McDevitt I'd read, and it launched me on a McDevitt jag for quite a while after.  Give it a shot - there are no Aerosmith soundtracks to make it hurt.	2001-07-02

I'd learned there was more than just the three &quot;Tales&quot; books with the characters I'd met and loved from the &quot;Tales of the City&quot; trilogy.  I was all ready to jump into that delightful care-free world (albeit a little reticent to bump into something like Jim Jones again, who showed up in &quot;Further Tales of the City&quot; and is the only disbelief I was unwilling to suspend).<br />However, staying true to the reality of the movement and the 80s, I found AIDS, death, decay and the long slide down from the fun and energy from the first three books.  I didn't mind, though it was a bit of slap in the face, and the death of a major character to AIDS before the book even begins was a real punch in the stomach.<br />Put simply, Maupin drove home, hard, how vivid the change was for those who had existed in the care-free seventies, who found themselves suddenly trapped in the shallow, AIDS-ridden eighties.  <br />The characters are back in full company, with the death of one major character, and the introduction of a few others.  The story still focuses mostly around Michael and Mary Anne to my mind, but the rest of the &quot;Tales&quot; folk are definately along for the ride.  The topics darken up a bit, and reality is definitely in play this time.  I reccommend it, but with the warning that you're not getting the same care-free tone of the &quot;Tales&quot; trilogy - for the seventies are over.	2001-07-02

Scott Cunningham's &quot;Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practicioner&quot; is usually hailed as the &quot;must-read&quot; information for the solitary young neophyte to the ways of paganism or wicca.  To be truthful, I agree.  The information herein is as complete as you can get in an introductory book, and only suffers for a lack of style.<br />While full of the &quot;what and how&quot; of the faith of Wicca, what is missing from this book is some sense of inspiration, or perhaps put better, something to make it a little less dry.  The book often reads like a repetition of facts more than a book about faith and magick.<br />All the basics are present: Esbats, tools, Sabbats, and the overall general structure of the faith of wicca.  It would be a good book to set the fears of uninformed parents aside, should their children become involved with Wicca.<br />I do suggest that anyone who is just starting out grab this book.  On the notion of merit towards teaching wicca alone, I'd rank this at a four or five star book, but slogging through it is apt to be a bit boring, and that cost it some stars for delivery.	2001-07-02

Instead, I sat down and read it cover to cover, enjoying every section, and leaving the book with a feeling like I'd just undergone a guided meditation on the wheel of the year.<br />This book is a valuable resource for all of us who have learned only the basics and the typical rituals associated with the wheel of the year and the major Sabbats, and wonderful for anyone looking for new ideas to make their sabbats fresh again.

A friend of mine is a History Major at the local univeristy, and she had the distinct pleasure of having taken a class with Prof. Granatstein before he retired.  She passed this book to everyone she knew, and I was lucky to get my turn with it early.<br />Canada has a rich and diverse culture, and its history is often scoffed (indeed, I can remember my family, all of us immigrants from England, saying, &quot;Canada doesn't *have* any history.&quot;)  This notion is wrong, and yet, it perpetuates.<br />Why?<br />Well, the question of who killed Canadian History is what Granatstein tackles in this book.  It is a quick read, but one you'll re-read, and is a pithy and witty account of how fragmented our educational system is on the concept of teaching Canadian History.  There are relevant facts scattered throughout this book, and statistics that made me, for one, ashamed of the Canadian educational system.  Granatstein speaks of changes that need to be made on both the educational system front and in post-educational institutions, and has put together a book that sincerely, and objectively, points out why Canadian History is so lost.  <br />Who Killed Canadian History?  We, the Canadians, did.  It's time to turn that around.	2001-07-02

While the first third of the book is in a Q&amp;A format that would be suitable - and informative - for the introduction of a neophyte to Wicca, Paganism, or Witchcraft, the second two parts of the book are anything but introductory.<br />Part two, made up of rituals and cellebrations, cover not just the most often seen Dedications, Esbats and Sabbats that make up an introductory experience, but holy rits for so many other holy days that I'd never come across before.  The Witch's calendar that Skelton has put together is the most detailed I've yet to come across, and would totally overwhelm the beginner.<br />Part three is Skelton's &quot;Workbook,&quot; which is quite advanced.  Spell theory on such varied topics as Love Spells (of which I personally debate the ethics), Healing Rituals, Blessings, Banishments, and Talismans, among other things, is set in this third part of the book.  The discussion is of a major depth, and at times would be very much over the head of a beginner.<br />One thing I did expect that I didn't find in this book was any reference to Canadian-specific information or rituals.  As one of the few published Canadian authors of Wicca/Witchcraft, I was hoping that Skelton would make mention of some of the Canadian-specific exeriences of the wheel of the year (for example, how often our Spring ceremonies are surrounded by snow and ice, when most rituals describe wandering out into the fresh new greenery to cellebrate).<br />This book is a delight to read, but again, I'll stress that as an introductory book, it is mislabelled.  I'd start someone off more with Jennifer Hunter's &quot;21st Century Wicca,&quot; or Scott Cunningham's &quot;Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practicioner,&quot; and only come back to Skelton a little later.	2001-07-02

As the author himself pointed out, Wicca is a religion, and far too often the focus is more toward the occult practices of the faith, not the gods and goddesses themselves.<br />The meditations in this book are wonderful ways to gain some focus, especially for people who might have a bit of trouble with meditation, or writing/scripting their own prayers or rituals.  The inspiration in this book practically hums.<br />What's more important, in my mind at least, however, is the constant focus of the book towards the gods and goddesses, providing substance to a large gap in most pagan/wiccan literature.  Case in point: none of my previous Pagan or Wiccan books had anything to say on the subject of the death of a loved one in the form of prayer or ritual, or, if they did, they mentioned it in passing as a &quot;personal moment&quot; and brought forth no advice nor gentle inspiration on the matter of coping, prayer, or ritual.  You'd think this occurrance would merit more attention.<br />When a good friend of mine died recently, there was a perfect prayer waiting for me in this book.  If for no other reason than that, I salute Mr. Ventimiglia for his work.<br />Blessed be.	2001-07-02

I was quite happy to come across a book that was devoted specifically to Pagan Gods, on both the front of a book taking a Pagan angle, and one focusing on Gods instead of Goddesses (a book subject in somewhat short supply).<br />That said, the book is exactly what it claims to be: a begginners guide.  THere is good information in here about Thoth, the Oak and Holly Kings, the Green Man, the Horned God, and so forth, but given the books size, it was all very quickly imparted, and as such left me with the feeling that I'd delved only a little, not reaching any real depth.  <br />Still, that said, there is a great beginning in this book.  Were the Mooreys to put out another, in depth title with a similar topic, I would not hesitate to go buy it.  If you are just beginning in Paganism or Wicca, and want to get yourself a firmer grasp on the basics of the Gods, grab this book and settle down for a great introductory read.	2001-07-02

For Gillian, the world is a place to meet, enjoy, and move on.  For Sally, the notion of a &quot;regular&quot; life is the prize, to be married, to have children, and to be a regular woman.  Neither of them get what they're expecting, and the result is, well, magic.<br />The evocative prose of this book left me breathless: Hoffman has a way to work with present and past tense narrative that will work wonders on most readers.  Her past tense writing gives you a sense of a fairy tale unfolding, and her present tense writing sucks you in with its sharp immediacy.  Most of all, her generational writing, dealing with the Aunts, to the Sisters, to the daughters of Sally, is a wonderful perspective and a truly moving piece of narrative.<br />The blend of folklore with life, and the sharp clarity of Hoffman's eye toward the emotional made this one of my favorites, and I have given copies of this book to many people in my time.

The sight of this book had me grinning.  I'm a self-admitted &quot;Pagan,&quot; and find that books on Wicca are aplenty, but books on a more eclectic pagan approach are rare books indeed.  Moorey has put together a fantastic little book that is exactly what it claims to be: a beginners guide for those interested in Paganism.<br />It covers a wide variety of faiths, and does them all justice even though it is quite a small volume.  Touching upon Wicca, Witchcraft, Shamanism, the Four Elements, Druidry, Celtic Paganism, Northern Traditions, and even a bit on Feminism and the newer Men's movements, the book is then rounded out with a small section on Cyber-Pagans, to boot (no pun intended)!  This is a very rewarding, quick and light read that will supply a small taste of many traditions, encapsulated in a wonderful theme of Paganism.<br />Earth Religions have rarely been treated this well in reference literature.	2001-07-02

Throughout my degree, and my previous highschool education, I've come across &quot;Tristan and Iseult&quot; in four different forms before Bedier's, and was so tired of the tale that I thought no one would breathe life into it again for me.<br />Not so.<br />Bedier's translation (which was then translated by Hilaire Belloc and completed by Paul Rosenfeld) has repainted &quot;Tristan and Iseult&quot; into a truly living piece of mythology.  Presented with exquisite detail, and with portions of the story even my four previous readings had never uncovered, this is, I believe, how the tale was meant to be told.<br />The achetypal doomed-romance, &quot;Tristan and Iseult&quot; is the well-known tale of the romance between those two lovers, born of a magical philtre, and doomed in the face of Iseult's marriage to King Mark.  The age of chivalry practically shines from the pages, and the heart-wrenching story itself is a joy to read, with only a few bumps and jolts of prose along the way (likely, I imagine, translation difficulties).<br />If you are at all interested in mythology, especially that of Arthurian theme or times, Bedier's translation of &quot;Tristan and Iseult&quot; is the one for you.  You won't be disappointed.	2001-07-02

Quite similar to &quot;Ancient Ways,&quot; by the same author and illustrator, the Campanellis return with &quot;The Wheel of the Year&quot; to further promote living the magical life.<br />This book is just as invaluable a resource as &quot;Ancient Ways&quot; was, and is organized by months where &quot;Ancient Ways&quot; was organized by Sabbat.  <br />The in depth discussions of the Esbats (Full Moon rituals and symbology associated with them) for each month were well crafted, and a subject quite underwritten in Pagan and Wiccan references.  The crafts for each month are likewise well thought-out, and varied enough that there are a few gems in hiding for every reader.<br />Give &quot;The Wheel of the Year&quot; a shot, and put it alongside &quot;Ancient Ways,&quot; on your bookshelf.  Together, they make a nearly complete reference guide for the year of Sabbats and Esbats, Rituals and Crafts, and the legends and myths and stories that make up the Wiccan year.	2001-07-02

The last in the &quot;Section 31&quot; series I read of the four, &quot;Cloak&quot; brings Section 31 to the Star Trek original series era.  Now, I feel it only fair to warn that I have truthfully read nearly none of the original era books in the Star Trek line, and don't often pick them up.<br />The strengths of &quot;Rogue&quot; and &quot;Abyss,&quot; however, made me decide to take the plunge and I'm glad I did.  &quot;Cloak&quot; is a good novel, has an excellent place in the Star Trek continuum, but fell short in a few ways.<br />The characters were very well written, and with a depth I must admit I'd not attributed to the original series characters before.  The author's choice to place this story in a timeframe near to some major events in the original series television episodes was a good one, especially on the front of Dr. McCoy.<br />However, &quot;Section 31&quot; barely seems to be involved in the book.  Kirk and company find a runaway starship with a dead crew aboard, and try to unravel the mystery of its sabotaged state, but you don't even get a ghost of Section 31 until the near end of the book, and I was left feeling a little bit shortchanged - I'd rather expected to get a little bit more into the origins of Section 31 with this book, but this book delves the shallowest into the organization of all four books in this series.<br />All of that aside, I did enjoy this book.  The inclusion of such things as the Omega Particle was excellent for continuity, and Spock's brush with the Romulan Commander was very well placed.  If I could, I'd give this a &quot;3.5&quot; stars, not just 3.	2001-07-01

This third installment of the &quot;Section 31&quot; series is back on par with &quot;Rogue,&quot; the Next Generation installment.  Set with the new and updated crew from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine's relaunched &quot;Avatar&quot; series, this time we focus on Julian Bashir as he is recruited, yet again, to work a mission Section 31 has set out for him.<br />The characterizations in this novel are dead on.  Bashir comes off entirely believable, without resorting to stale rehashings of things we've already seen in the series, and Ezri Dax, in particular, shines.  I'm really enjoying the new direction they're taking Dax in, and it has yet to reveal any real faults.  <br />Fans of the Jem'Hadar will get a little more out of Taran'atar, and fans of Ro Laren are in for some very good &quot;in her head&quot; passages, which I found particularly well written.  The plotline from Avatar with Jake is briefly glossed over (something I wish had been given more time, but I understand the notion of raising tension levels), and you get a little bit more out of Commander Vaughn, and why Ensign Tenmei hates the new second officer.<br />The plot itself is quite intricate, with Julian being pitted against an enemy even he has to admit he is perfectly suited: another genetically enhanced individual.  This man, Dr. Locken, is setting himself up as the new Khan, and it's up to Julian to stop it before it causes another war between the major powers of the Alpha and Beta Quadrants.  The pace is well set, and despite the inclusion of an extraneous &quot;fuzzy/cute&quot; alien race, it is a great read.<br />I highly reccommend this one.	2001-06-30

Two friends and myself listened to this tape on a long drive back home from Toronto to Ottawa.  We laughed so hard we were crying.  Given that this is supposed to be a thriller, this is not such a good thing.<br />First off, though I rarely listen to audiobooks, the narrator of this tale tried to put &quot;accents&quot; and &quot;masculinity&quot; in voices as she read for them.  I imagine that was to help us differentiate, but she doesn't have a whole lot of talent for it, and it just ended up sounding somewhat trite or foolish.<br />Secondly, the writing itself was somewhat straightforward.  We had car-consensus on the murderer by the end of the first side of tape one, and then just sat back and waited for it to play out.  Worse, the stereotyped use of yet another semi-psycho lesbian had us groaning out loud.<br />The strange thing is, we really enjoyed the ride.  We haven't laughed like that in a long time... but like I said, it wasn't supposed to be a laughing story.  It was laughing at, not with.<br />Skip this tape.	2001-06-25

Don finds a wreck of a house and begins restoring it - only to find that there is a power within its walls that will alternately terrify and tempt him. <br />Haunted houses are old hat, but Card adds a new twist that makes the story fresh and interesting. The story zags in directions you weren't expecting, and the characters are all quite vivid. A good read from a great talent. <br />This book will appeal to fans of Stephen King, John Saul and Dean Koontz, but, oddly enough, I'm willing to bet that Card fans won't like it much at all.  I've read a few other novels by Card from his Fantasy and Science Fiction works, and I find that he does very well at those, and didn't quite do as well on this in comparison.  Objectively, however, I managed to ignore who had written the book and enjoyed it as a new twist on Haunted Houses in its own right.  <br />Dedicated Orson Scott Card fans should give this a pass, but people who'd like a new take on ghostly tales will definately enjoy this one.	2001-06-25

I was pleasantly surprised by this book.  The &quot;Complete Idiot's Guide to Wicca and Witchcraft,&quot; is actually a remarkably well put together book that covers most of the major dimensions of the faith and religion and practice of Wicca.<br />At first, I was worried this book would be yet another &quot;recipe book&quot; of spells, which it manages to keep to a bare minimum (though the cynic in me says that there is still more than enough of this approach in the book to appeal to the teeny-bopper 'I just want to do spells' crowd).<br />Covering a variety of subjects within the grander scope of Wicca, including gems and crystals, herbs, Esbats, Sabbats, and the other basics and colourful parts of Wicca.  However, in this overview, some things weren't given enough time or emphasis: most notably the ethics of Wicca, which aren't so simple as to be worthy of only the most often quoted Rede's &quot;An it harm none, do as thou wilt.&quot;  Often glassed over by books on Wicca, the CIG does work with the ethics a little, but not as much as would be required in a book claiming to be a starter.<br />I'd reccommend this book for those who've already gone through &quot;Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practicioner,&quot; by Scott Cunningham, for example, or for parents of youths who are wondering or questioning what their children are doing.  It is quite accessible, and done well.	2001-06-25

Meet Alex, an &quot;animist.&quot;  He has abilities to sense into the magickal Oether, and see spirits and magick all around him.  He has graduated from the Animism college, and is going out into the world to find his &quot;Anim,&quot; a specific animal he will bond with and with which he can open up his full potential of magickal ability.  He was sold to the college as a slave, and as such, has to earn money to pay them back to earn his freedom.<br />Alex is a delightful character, an innocent and rather naive kid who has no concepts of some of the bad things that are out there.  His adventure is remarkably funny, and I was laughing aloud at many sections of this poor kid's life.  Alex bonds with a rat, Mote, near the beginning of the story, and the tale runs at a decent pace thereafter.<br />Forward does, however, tend to &quot;over-fantasy&quot; her book.  There are races and bits and pieces of the world that at times make you blink in confusion, and it sometimes borders on too much.  Raptor-people, rat-people, lemur-people... it starts to confuse.<br />It's a book I can only describe as &quot;cute,&quot; and if you like Tanya Huff's &quot;Summon the Keeper,&quot; the tone is similar and you'd likely enjoy &quot;The Animist.&quot;	2001-06-25

This was, well, awful.<br />It seems like the author bit off more than she could chew.  She drew together plots with Captain Bateman and his crew (from the TNG Episode &quot;Cause and Effect,&quot;), brought in the brand new Enterprise-E, tied in Scotty, the Gul that tortured Picard in &quot;Chain of Command,&quot;, some previous-century Klingons, and - oh yes - a holodeck recreation of Kirk.  And tribbles.<br />The result is an alarmingly out-of-character mash of crossovers that leaves you feeling like you're reading a comedy, not a science fiction novel.  The only thing that redeemed this book at all to me was the plight of Captain Bateman and his crew, stranded far ahead of their own timeline.  They were interesting.  The rest was not.<br />Skip this one, unless you'd like to know more about the crew of the USS Bozeman.  But go to a library.	2001-06-17

From that level, &quot;Pan&quot; is enjoyable: there's a rich field between the covers in which one can harvest many references to notions both mythological and symbolic.<br />And that's about it.<br />From a narrative point of view, I have rarely been this bored.  The &quot;hero&quot; (and I use the term lightly) is near unlikable - worse, next to impossible to empathize with - the &quot;heroine&quot; (again, note the quotes) is so over-the-top stereotypical that she comes off like cardboard, and the plot itself reads like a soap-opera.  The soap-opera style, however, might well explain the proliferation and popularity of this work.  When I wasn't bored, I was disgusted, the characters acted like a house full of children bored on a rainy day, and the only redeemable traits of this book were the wonderful tangental references to mythology, and the vivid descriptions of nature.<br />Pass on this, folks, unless you like soaps.	2001-06-17

Parallelling Joseph Campbell's notion of universal myths, this book is an exciting journey through various myth-types that seem to crop up in nearly every culture.  Explore Creation Myths, Flood Myths, Hero Myths, and Object Myths, for a few examples, in a way that crosses cultures and time periods with ease.  A truly diverse selection is in this work, this is not just your typical compilation of Greek and Roman myths.

The second in the &quot;Section 31&quot; series, I probably would have given &quot;Shadow&quot; two stars, had it not, near the end, picked up with a very unique idea for the &quot;villain&quot; of the story, and taken a turn for the better, plot wise.<br />The plot, as I've said, starts out a little frustrating, but definately picks up mid-to-end of the book.  But the characterization of a lot of the characters seems a little off on first glance.  Now, certainly, there are clues that this book takes place not-too-far into the development of Seven's character (it happens at some point during the time of Tom Paris' demotion to Ensign), but Seven comes across especially harsh.  This isn't so horrible a thing - I imagine writing Seven must be a much more monumental task than even writing a Vulcan - but at times I found myself disliking her, which isn't something that happened during the run of the series.<br />The involvement of Section 31 in Voyager is given a very plausible run - an agent was assigned, we learn at the very beginning, to help the &quot;Maquis&quot; situation turn out the way that Section 31 wanted it to.  This is not a plot of a Section 31 Officer who is still in contact with the Federation (as I'd previously worried, prior to buying the book).  <br />Give it a shot if you like the Section 31 idea, but it's a good read regardless, just a little weak at the beginning.	2001-06-15

A highly evocative piece of prose, &quot;The Mistress of Spices&quot; was the first book I've read of Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni, and I'm going to find more.  <br />The blend of spice-centric folklore, deep emotional sacrifice, and the clashing worlds of things city and things cultural create a sense of counterpoint in this novel.  You follow the Mistress herself, a woman to whom the spices sing, and in whose hands their tastes and uses are magickal.  This is a woman who shed her youth to an immortal aged form to aid the world around her.  <br />As the Mistress grows more and more involved in the lives of those around her, she might just risk everything, including not only her immortality but maybe her life as well, on the chance of love, passion, and the urge to care and help those around her.  It is often said, 'with great power comes great responsibility' and this cultural exploration of that notion is just phenomenal.<br />If you like the works of Alice Hoffman (of &quot;Practical Magic&quot; fame), or &quot;Like Water for Chocolate,&quot; for example, I would reccommend this book highly.	2001-06-11

I was in the mood for something light and fun when I picked up this book, and I was well rewarded for the thought.  &quot;If Only It Were True,&quot; is a heartwarming little story with a fantasy touch.<br />Lauren is a doctor who has a horrible car accident at the beginning of the novel, ending up in a coma.  <br />Months later, unknowingly living in her home, Arthur, a young architect, is interrupted in his bath when he hears someone snapping their fingers in his closet.  He opens the door, and there is Lauren.  He can see her, he can touch her, and he can hear her.  She is a living ghost, but for some reason he is able to interact with her.<br />Far from being a typical ghostly-love story, &quot;If Only It Were True,&quot; departs from the usual formulas, and actually manages to throw in some wonderful and thought-provoking concepts into the mix.  Should Arthur allow Lauren's mother to turn off the life support machines and gain her mother closure and an end to the pain - given that her &quot;ghost&quot; might fade?  There is much more to this read than meets the eye on first glance, and it is well worth the small investment of time.  You'll smile, and feel warmed, by this book.	2001-06-11

Having had the wonderful opportunity to meet Mr. Mofina when he came into my store to do a signing, I had decided to read this book before meeting him, so I could spread the word on the title and the story before his arrival.<br />Wow.<br />First off, this book is packed with Mr. Mofina's background in criminal reporting.  The crime, the police, the journalists, all of them spring to life and are very plausible.  Moreover, he handles not only the adults with skill but grants us a realistic use of youth and children - something many writers fail to accomplish.<br />This book is a page-turner.  I started it and finished it in one sitting, unable to put it aside.  The cliff-hanger had me on the edge of my seat (literally), and the story was deeply moving.  You can feel for someone who has lost his children, even when he has snapped and now wishes to get them back through murder... Sympathetic villains are hard to do, but Mofina does it well.<br />I hear word of a sequel, and can't wait to see it.	2001-06-11

The &quot;Witch's Handbook,&quot; offered by the Frosts is in no way representative of any other group or solitary witch I've ever seen.  The complete lack of ethics in this book is astounding.  <br />Magick is discussed more as a means to an end than anything else: find something you want, use magick to get it.  There's a passage whereby the authors suggest inundating a car with imagery and psychic energy of crashes in order to make sure no one else buys it.  Any other witch I know would see that as a negative act, not a positive one.<br />I've been practicing for nearly eight years, and though I'm an ecclectic sort, I've never come across any other book this empty of virtue or knowledge.  This is not witchcraft as I've ever seen it before, and while disagreeing paths are a wonderful thing, this book became the only one I ever returned in my long history of wicca/witch/pagan bookbuying.<br />Don't waste your money.	2001-06-07

While this is a tale often told (the psychic and the police is a very common theme in psychic fiction), Susan is a wonderful character, and the mystery itself was a truly engrossing tale.<br />Susan's psychic abilities, while important to the plot, are secondary to both her psychiatric training, her deep characterization, and her relationship with her son.  I cannot stress enough how much this book is character-driven, and how much the mystery it self - the chasing of an apparent serial killer with an agenda that baffles - brings this novel to a boil.  There is a sequel, &quot;Blood,&quot; that definately has me hooked.  <br />I hope for more Susan Shader novels, and would really like to know who Joseph Glass is.	2001-06-07

Crew replacements for those who left in the season finale are here, including some really strong previously seen characters (Ro Laren), and some new characters with strong writing behind them (It's nice to see an Andorian again, for example).<br />The plot kicks into high gear, with a surprise switch at the ending that really made me smile.

Just exploring the new characters would be good, but there's a decent plot around this novel as well - the station, gutted for refitting that is way overdue, ends up under attack again by forces that might be the Dominion.  Renewed aggression?  Rebels?

An interesting take on Section-31, which we've only seen through the eyes of the cast of DS9 prior to now, &quot;Rogue&quot; pits some Section-31 operatives against the crew of the USS Enterprise-E, previous to the movie &quot;First Contact.&quot;<br />Winding in some strong characters from previous TNG Episodes (Jean-Luc Picard's cadet friends in the present day, as introduced in &quot;Tapestry&quot;), and focusing quite centrally around Lieutenant Hawk from &quot;First Contact,&quot; the authors have really written a character-driven novel here. <br />Tal Shiar machinations, Section-31's double-dealings, and loyalties to the Federation are definately the counterpoints of this particular novel in the Section-31 series (the rest of which I will certainly buy since this one was so good.)  One other reviewer made mention of the &quot;social agenda&quot; of including a homosexual character, to which I'd definately say he has misclassified.  The character's sexuality does nothing to the plot that a heterosexual relationship wouldn't do, and certainly gives us a very honest representation of the Federation future of acceptance and tolerance like that we've seen in &quot;Rejoined,&quot; for example.<br />Go and get this one.

A gathering of many different fantasy creatures and races, guided by various prophecies, slowly weave into the party that will travel and protect Elena, as she hurriedly tries to learn to use her gifts, and desperately hopes to survive the coming of the Dark Heart and its minions.<br />A very stirring read marred only by an unnecessary proliferation of apostrophies.  D'warf, El'vin, Wit'ch - it's enough to drive you to distraction.  Still, the story itself makes it more than worthwhile to suffer through these written hiccoughs. <br />Good for fans of George R.R. Martin, Lyn Flewelling, or Robert Jordan.	2001-05-20

Despite the still frustrating inclusion of the over-used apostrohpes, Clemens kicks his &quot;Banned and Banished&quot; series into high gear with this second book.  &quot;Wit'ch Storm,&quot; returns us to Elena and her companions, and shows them coming up against some of the first, and deeply evil, minions of the Dark Heart.<br />Elena's powers are more thouroughly explored and developed in this sequel, and further, the supporting characters often get time of their own in this book.  A few new characters make an appearance, and you get much more backstory to the evil Dark Heart and his minions, the ill'guard.<br />If you enjoyed George R.R. Martin, Robert Jordan, or Lyn Flewelling, I'd really suggest you give this series a try.  It's very well written, has a stirring plot, and if you can manage to ignore those awful apostrophes, a worthy read.  The magic is very unique, written in a way different from any other fantasy story I've read, and that fresh approach to magic is a rare treat.	2001-05-20

That said, Charles De Lint (Canada's King of Fantasy, in my book), has put together a collection of his &quot;Newford,&quot; stories in &quot;Dreams Underfoot.&quot;<br />Newford is a city touched by magic.  &quot;Urban Fantasy,&quot; is a great way to think of it - you've got a typical tough city atmosphere, but magic is there, waiting to be found, if one only believes.  Through some reoccurring characters, the stories tie together wonderfully - with an amazing final story that wraps up the collection with great style.  <br />Newford is a place where the homeless sometimes walk fairy roads, where music can save a life, and where a sleeping woman can meet the man of her dreams, while she's dreaming.  Inherit a wonderful collection of myth and magic of today - go get this book.	2001-05-02

Dave Goulet grew up in a funeral home, and his wonderfully told tales of life in the parlor had me grinning in spite of myself. <br />I'm not sure why he chose the word &quot;confessions&quot; for the subtitle, as most of the tales read as slightly funny, all-to-realistic romps through what could only happen in a family of four and some resident corpses.  Though I'm suddenly wondering if I want to ever be put on display in a funeral parlor (there's an interesting story about bugs and a few cans of Raid I think I could have done without raiding), Dave Goulet's overall tone is certainly respectful. <br />This makes a great gift for someone who has a bent sense of humour, and certainly served as a conversation starter when I had it on my living room table at home.	2001-04-15

This book tells nearly everything that makes Ottawa beautiful, instead of just another city.	2001-04-15

Camilla MacPhee bursts onto the senses like a sarcastic gin and tonic.  A tough lawyer with a very no-nonsense approach (and a deep disrespect for all things feline), Camilla finds herself in the very unhappy situation of being best friend to a murder suspect.<br />It doesn't help that the victim was an out-and-out unlikeable fashion critic who seemed to thrive on blasting women in power for wearing pumps that didn't match.  No one liked her, and someone didn't like her enough to kill her.  Now Camilla has to use every bit of wit she has (and she has plenty) to solve a crime before her friend ends up in jail.  She just has to juggle her friends cats, the world's worst assistant, and a detective determined to date her sister, and a potential romance of her own - oh my!<br />Set in Ottawa during the tulip festival, this is a great book for anyone who likes a tough, albeit cranky, heroine with attitude.  The mystery itself is engaging, and Camilla's life just sucks you right in.  I for one, can't wait for &quot;The Icing on the Corpse,&quot; which is the upcoming sequel.	2001-04-15
US	45088744	R2XPA9S5PRY8GQ	0061054267	429849413	Ancient Shores	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Not my favorite McDevitt, but thought-provoking	While I did enjoy &quot;Ancient Shores,&quot; it was not my favorite of McDevitt's work by any means.  The idea was quite sound: a boat made of materials that simply shouldn't exist is uncovered in a farmer's field.  Further away, a building that grants a new type of technology - and a new way to travel - is uncovered.  But from there, the book got a little scattershot and random.<br />We follow many world reactions to this newfound technology - from the collapse of the stock market at the apparent use of materials that would never wear out, to religious fanatics, to the UN demanding the artifact be made a world-owned item, free of any one nationality.  McDevitt certainly extrapolates the effect of technological change in this novel, and it is quite a classic approach to Science Fiction.<br />However, the plot withers amid all of this extrapolation.  The heroine and hero of the story begin to get less and less air-time, and ultimately fizzle out near the end.  Likewise, a sub-plot of a potential &quot;alien trapped on earth&quot; peaks interest, then loses ground to yet another tangent in the story.<br />For a better tale of the effects of Science and Technology on the world stage of economics and politics, try the &quot;Red Mars,&quot; &quot;Green Mars,&quot; &quot;Blue Mars,&quot; trilogy by Stanley Robinson.  McDevitt had a good idea here, but it just didn't quite fly as high as it should have.  It was interesting, and made me think of a few new ideas, but didn't drive me to the end like his tales usually do.	2001-04-12
US	45088744	R1M16GE07O2XKX	0060931892	146235403	One of the Guys	Books	4	12	17	N	N	One of the Guise.	This is a most unusual novel. You've got Miles Derry, who begins the book cleaning up the glory-hole video booths at a porn shop. He's an ex-addict, ex-drunk, a father of one child out of wednlock he has never really gotten to know, and has spent his whole life feeling like he is just not &quot;One of the Guys.&quot; Well, in one of said booths is a dead naval chaplain, who bears more than enough of a passing resemblance to Miles that Miles can assume his identity. Shipping out with the Navy as a Chaplain, Miles has what I can only call a somewhat surreal journey, which, regardless of a few bumps along the way, kept my interest throughout.<br />Despite some really foul language (even I was blushing at parts), and a few very tired stereotypes (gay priests yet again, anyone?), the book was very good, and I enjoyed it.  It is cynical, and in places outright repulsive in the vivid prose used to describe what is going on about, around, and to our pseudo-chaplain.  I also have no grasp at all on the US Navy and its workings, but imagine that Young's representations were extrapolated: driven to an extreme to really show the sides he wanted illustrated.  I'm above the 49th parallel, though, so I found a lot of the Navy rules, regulations, and acronyms stupefying, making it much easier to walk this novel hand in hand with Miles.<br />I caution against reading this book too seriously.  I laughed a lot, when I wasn't swallowing a wince or a queasy feeling, and even though I'm finished, I still can't decide how I feel about Miles.  It's a thought-provoking book, if you can get past the coarseness and gore.  I'd reccommend it, just beware the sea-sickness.	2001-04-09
US	45088744	RIJ3QMXNA46NJ	0886779200	595197569	The Family: Special Effects, Book 1	Books	2	1	2	N	N	A good idea with a poor followthrough.	It is an idea that has been done before: A trio of kids with psychic abilities in a secret project run by the FBI that goes a little too far.  In this case, the three children are taken by an agent who sees just how dark and wrong the project has become, and the four run to Hollywood to hide and try to have a normal life.  Unfortunately, the FBI Agent who took the kids bumps into a friend from highschool who is now a detective, and when a strange serial-murder case stumps the police, this new &quot;family&quot; gets involved to try and catch the killer.<br />There are a two serious flaws to the book that come glaring through, however, and really detract from what could otherwise have been a good story.  One is mechanical: my copy had at least a half-dozen typos.  &quot;Spider planet,&quot; instead of &quot;spider plant,&quot; and more than a few misplaced quotation marks that turned an otherwise tense scene into a matter of confusion.<br />The other flaw to the tale is one that often comes with science fiction stories focused on psychic abilities: the kids only seem to remember they have these abilities when it is climactic to the plot.  When one of the kids is left in a coma, the coma goes on for days before one of the other kids decides to even make a telepathic attempt at recovery.<br />Still, if you do enjoy tales with psychic characters, the idea isn't poor, just the presentation.  Given that it is sub-titled &quot;book one,&quot; likely this was also very much a set-up novel, and the next might be more fluid and less clumsy.  If you'd like a more stirring tale of psychic runaways from the FBI, pick up a copy of the classic Stephen King &quot;Firestarter,&quot; instead.	2001-04-05

Even better, Andrew K. Stone's novel has an immediacy and grip that Irving often lacks.  <br />What struck me as so important about this book was the absolute poignancy of the relationship between the narrator and his best friend.  Watching this pair of somewhat codependant friends navigate through a nasty world of suicides, deaths, pain, loves, hopes and dreams was an incredibly enjoyable experience.  Despite more than a fair share of frustrations and failures, the pair manage to hold onto their desire to make a difference.<br />Given the backdrop of the Boston music scene as a perfect counterpart for the ultimate theme of the book, &quot;All Flowers Die&quot; dares to ask that hardest question: &quot;Do I dare chase my dream?&quot;	2001-03-31

When I read the first novel in the Katy Klein series, &quot;Pluto Rising,&quot; I really enjoyed it.  It was fun, had a very new concept (Katy Klein is a professional astrologer), and it gave me a good overall feeling.  Set in Ottawa, my own city, it was a thrill to recognize places and laugh at some inside jokes.<br />&quot;Jupiter's Daughter,&quot; however, was possessed of an emotional depth, and had some really courageous ideas in it.  Karen Irving has definately grown since &quot;Pluto Rising,&quot; and I've heard that there's a new one on the way, which I can't wait for.  The ending of &quot;Jupiter's Daughter,&quot; had me nearly crying, and the mystery had me entirely flummoxed.  I had no idea &quot;whodunnit,&quot; and it kept me gripped waiting to find out.<br />If you're looking for a mystery that isn't trite, and can actually get you emotionally involved, grab this one.	2001-03-31

I took it home, and sat down with it, and started to chuckle.  But by the end of the book, I wasn't laughing nearly as much as I thought I would.<br />Here's the deal: It's not really all that funny, because although it's right on the nose and pokes a lot of fun at our own gay ideosyncracies, the book is also showing just how shallow, lacking, and fundamentally messed up gay culture is.  <br />Now, I'm certainly not going to say that this wasn't a pleasure to read, it just left me with a melancholy feeling: Gosh, isn't it sad that we're pretty much just a joke.  It was fun, but sometimes bitter, light, but sometimes kind of mean, this book seems to adeptly sum up the so-called gay culture: Laughable, but not all that funny sometimes, and very often pretty damned sad and lacking in self-esteem.	2001-03-31
