It's hardly news that college sports are corrupt - amateurism is and probably always was un-workable.  What is news, however, is that most colleges lose money from their athletic programs.  Readers see that while football and basketball might attract revenue, they seldom offset the losses from \\"non-revenue\\" sports like gymnastics, tennis, swimming, track, etc.  Also, winning sports teams fail to increase academic donations to host colleges - alumni don't like their schools having \\"jock\\" reputations.  The author shows how colleges abuse Pell and minority grants to benefit athletics, and how these institutions force students (or their parents) to pay hefty \\"activities fees\\" along with tuition to bail out the athletic department   <br /> <br />Like most appeals to reform NCAA sports, this book fell on deaf ears - we simply like the games too much.  Still, this book should be of interest to educators and to students forced to pay outrageous activity fees at tuition time.       <br />	2005-08-10

Shirer describes life inside Nazi Germany from his six-year perch (1934-1940) as a foreign correspondent for newspapers and CBS radio.  Readers get a feel for everyday life in Nazi Germany as Hitler consolidated his power, crushed (or killed) his opponents, and put the jobless to work building a war machine for future conquest.   <br /> <br />Shirer begins by describing his days in Vienna, Afghanistan, Spain, and France, but the book's heart comes with his posting to Berlin in 1934.  Readers learn about Gestapo terror, prewar rearmament, increasing anti-Semitism, and the devotion of many (but not all) Germans to their violent Fuehrer.  Shirer also examines the inexplicable appeasement policies of France and Britain - policies that leave one as baffled today as in the 1930's.  The author recounts joining Ed Murrow at CBS Radio in 1938 and then broadcasting events such as the Anchluss (takeover) of Austria, the betrayal at Munich, and the German invasion of Poland.  Shirer also recounts traveling with the German army as it tore through Belgium in 1940, seeing Paris under Nazi rule, and broadcasting the French surrender.  The book's nicely readable prose vividly recreates the stifling atmosphere and the unfolding, utterly preventable tragedy.   <br /> <br />Journalist-author William L. Shirer (1904-93) wrote superbly readable eye-witness accounts of 20th Century history.  This 1984 memoir was his final bestseller on Nazi Germany, and every bit as readable as the earlier two, BERLIN DIARY (1941) and RISE AND FALL OF THE THIRD REICH (1960).      <br />	2005-08-10

In 1984 British authorities found the raped and strangled body of teenager Lynda Mann in the woods near Narborough, England.  With a possible suspect in custody, a local scientist named Alec Jeffreys persuaded detectives to let him use the suspect's blood in a new DNA procedure that could certify the young man's guilt.  Authorities quickly agreed, but to everybody's surprise the results showed the suspect to be innocent.  When young Dawn Ashworth was found similarly brutalized three years later,  DNA testing showed that the same fiend had committed both crimes.  Scotland Yard then ordered every male in the district to submit a blood sample in a massive (and ultimately successful) search for the killer.  <br /> <br />Author Joseph Waumbaugh applies his straightforward, readable style in THE BLOODING.  He teaches us about the two crimes, the British legal system, the false leads that are part of detective work, and initial skepticism toward DNA fingerprinting.  Wambaugh also shows how this now-common technique helped authorities clear an innocent suspect and eventually catch a brutal killer.  <br />	2005-08-09

The novel centers on a group of animals that take over their farm and establish their own government.  One of their commandments states that, \\"All Animals Are Equal.\\"  This lofty slogan soon changes as the pigs, who are in the position of great influence, become tempted by privilege and power.  Soon the pigs run roughshod over the other species, and twist their commandments to justify violence against the other animals, who find themselves violated and betrayed.  The analogies to the 1917 Communist Revolution in Russia are unmistakable - workers foolishly believed Lenin's slogan (\\"Peace, Bread, Land\\") only to find themselves betrayed by a brutal dictatorship that crushed freedom with secret police killings, forced collectives, and Stalinist gulags.<br /><br />Author George Orwell (1903-1950) understood treachery, power, violence and greed.  Sadly, this readable story contains a remarkable ring of truth.	2005-06-16

But away from the press box Cosell was a surprisingly well-informed sports journalist.  And this book has him taking intelligent looks at the hypocrisy and power struggles that went on behind the sports scenes.  Here he recounts the passing of Jackie Robinson, the politics of the NFL and amateur athletics, and his account of the tragic 1972 Olympics when terrorists murdered Israeli athletes.  The book is dated, but it provides a readable look at sports and the often under-handed politics of sports.     <br />	2005-05-29

The story centers on young Carrie Meeber, who arrives in Chicago to live with her sister and brother-in-law.  Carrie is expected by her hosts to work full-time, turn over her pay, and basically sit quietly in her free time.   Thankfully, she rebels against such strictures and soon leaves.  Carries soon finds herself rising via incredible talent on the theatrical stage and affairs with a couple of men.  In time she leaves for New York City with Hurstwood, whom she splits up with (he ends his days in flophouses) when the time is appropriate.   <br /> <br />I found this book a bit less engaging than most reviewers, yet it is clearly worth reading.  Author Theodore Dreiser (1871-1945) attacked the way women were made to be dependent on men, and his sympathetic portrayal of Carrie was considered highly controversial in 1900.  As such Dreiser found his book banned and then published over a decade later with several sections omitted.   <br />	2005-05-29

The obvious suspect was her estranged husband, but proving his guilt would be no easy matter.  As the author shows, Brad Cunningham was exceptionally bright and calculating.  Since his youth he'd used his strength, looks, magnetism, and lack of scruples to bully his way, with women, in business, everywhere.    Each of his ex-wives (plus his mother and sisters) all feared him as a control freak and unscrupulous misogynist.  Some rightly indict Cheryl for having slept with Brad while he was married to her friend, but in time that betrayed friend came to sympathize with the beleaguered victim.  This narrative covers the lengthy investigation, Brad's troubled relationships, and his calculated attempts to outwit the law and intimidate witnesses and government prosecutors.  We also learn of the civil lawsuit that helped eventually bring this killer to justice.  <br /> <br />This probably isn't Ann Rule's top narrative.  I would clearly rate \\"And Never Let Her Go\\" plus \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" as superior.  Still, Rule keeps the reader engaged, and that's a key to good writing.     <br /> <br />	2005-05-29

But away from the microphone Cosell was a capable print journalist who often wrote with great clarity and perspective.  Here at his retirement Cosell writes about sports franchises relocating, problems within the NFL and boxing, sports announcers and Monday Night Football.  Cosell makes several interesting points, but unfortunately his arrogance and ceaseless criticisms for his coworkers (and bragging about himself) was such a turnoff that I never finished these pages.  If you found Cosell as perfect as he apparently did, you'll probably enjoy this book and the author's unbounded egotism.	2005-05-29

Cronkite also takes a long look at U.S. history during the post-war period, including the end of World War II, the Cold War, Civil Rights, Vietnam, etc.   He also devotes strong attention (and opinions) to America's Presidents in that era.   Most would consider Cronkite politically centrist, but some conservatives (including TV's mythical Archie Bunker) despised his pro-UN, and eventual anti-Vietnam view.  Readers get a feel for what it's like to have access to the high and mighty, as well as the sense that politicians see reporters as people to be used for their ends.  Cronkite also reveals such personal issues as his family life, and his love for race cars and speed.     <br /> <br />This is an informative and engaging read, yet a bit shallow for one who moved in the constellations of power.   Perhaps that comes from the author's status as America's anchorman, a task requiring one to strive to be calm, level and centered.       <br /> <br />	2005-05-06

Daley (1902-1976) of Chicago, and this one concentrates on the mayor's political moves during his 21st and final year in office.  The author suggests that Daley's keen mind had faded in the aftermath of his 1974 stroke.  We see how the Mayor made several strikingly bad political moves in that election year (1976).  To begin, the mayor paid little heed to the rise of Georgia's governor Jimmy Carter during that year's presidential primaries.  Daley also opposed a black Congressman (Raplh Metcalfe) who dared protest against police brutality, backed a talented yet doomed candidate (Mike Howlett) for Governor, and was unable to win the state's electoral votes against the Republicans.  We also get a highly engaging look at the Mayor's last hour on earth (in the initial chapter) as he was felled by a heart attack a few days before Christmas.	2005-05-06

Author Truman Capote (1924-1984) writes superbly as he recreates the events of this horrid crime, and lets us peek into the minds of the perpetrators.       <br /> <br />Dick Hickock and Perry Smith were losers who took it on faith from a fellow inmate that a certain farm family in Western Kansas had a cash-filled safe in their house.  There was no such safe, and all these punks got for their terrible deed was $40.  The author examines the family background of the two killers, their friendship, and their crime.  We also learn about their capture, trial, and life on Kansas' death row.  Ever mindful of the victims, Capote also lets us know the four members of the Clutter family who tragically lost their lives.   <br /> <br />Capote apparently hoped to make a powerful statement against the death penalty, but his subjects are hardly the type to elicit sympathy.  Still, this is a superbly moving (and at times disturbing) nonfiction novel.          <br />	2005-05-06

This early novel by Richard Wright (1908-1960) went unpublished until after he died.  This is far from Wright's best work, yet these pages show his stunning talent for descriptive prose. The story centers on a day in the life of a rather crude Chicago postal worker in the 1930's.  He begins his morning by arguing with his wife.  At work, he argues with his boss, then after work he gambles and drinks.  Finally, he returns home drunk and beats his wife.  That's hardly the best of tales.

Jurgis Rudkus is a strong and hard working newcomer from Lithuania, but he's soon worn down by his exhausting labor in the city's once-burgeoning stockyards. Every time another burden befalls his impoverished family, his response is to say that he will work harder - which is no answer.  Eventually his family split ups because of the burdens and hardships they face in a cold-hearted city where unskilled immigrants worked long hours for poverty wages.<br /><br />Sinclair wrote the book hoping to promote socialism and help for the poor.  But it was his searing description of unsanitary meat-packing practices - sawdust, poisoned rats, and dirty rain water all ground into your hamburger - that infuriated the public and led Congress to establish the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to inspect the nation's food supply.<br /><br />I gave this novel four stars because it drags in places.  Still, \\"The Jungle\\" provides a searing description of life among poor immigrants and meat-packing practices in the first decade of the 20th Century.	2005-05-03

The author aptly describes both the play on the field and the team's ownership moves that occurred behind the scenes.   <br /> <br />I liked reading of the down-to-the-wire pennant race, where the defending world champions overcame age, injuries, and challenges by the upstart Milwaukee Braves and Cincinnati Reds.  We get an inside look at many players; aging leaders Jackie Robinson and Pee Wee Reese, garrulous Roy Campanella, sulking slugger Duke Snider, volatile hurler Don Newcombe, etc.  Readers feel almost inside the clubhouse as the talented players fight for another pennant.  <br /> <br />Interwoven into the pages is an informed look at the seamy business moves of owner Walter O'Malley.  Declining attendance had O'Malley looking for a new stadium while also secretly negotiating with the city of Los Angeles.  The author indicts city planning czar Robert Moses for blocking a new Dodger stadium in downtown Brooklyn - but the greedy O'Malley was hardly blameless.  In the end, of course, O'Malley callously deserted to California, leaving thousands of broken hearts in Brooklyn.       <br /> <br />This book is informative, engaging and well-researched (if too easy on O'Malley).

Cross Damon is an alienated young black man in Chicago in 1950 with a wife and family he doesn't really love, and an unfulfilling postal job.  Dissatisfied with his life, he eagerly takes the plunge when given an unexpected chance to skip town unnoticed with a bundle of money.  Moving to New York City, he soon becomes mixed up with violent communists and a white district attorney whose disability makes him, like African Americans, an outsider in U.S. society. Damon is bright and not uneducated, but he's also devious, violent, and unable to sidestep troublesome associates one must avoid. <br />  <br />Like most books by Richard Wright, \\"The Outsider\\" attacks racial injustice in a readably engaging manner...but is a bit long-winded.  Unlike earlier efforts like \\"Native Son,\\" here Wright disdains communists as violent and oppressive.  Perhaps that was due to McCarthyism, but more likely it stems from the fact that the murderous oppression of Stalin and communist police states was better known by 1950.                      <br />	2005-04-29

Here he lets Allied veterans (and a few Germans) tell their tales of that terrible yet successful day.     <br /> <br />Readers feel as if we are there alongside the assault troops, airborne, and rangers as they hit the beaches. We immediately sense the danger, suspense, fear, and adrenaline of June 6, 1944.  Despite several mishaps, the Allies succeeded via a combination of luck, perseverance, improvisation, and because control of the air and sea lanes helped them overwhelm the German defenders.   <br /> <br />The American author focuses more on the U.S. assaults at Utah and Omaha beaches than on the equally vital efforts by the British (Gold, Sword) and Canadians (Juno) on their beaches.  Also, some will disagree with Ambrose's view that the \\"soldiers of democracy\\" were demonstrably superior to their German opponents.  Allied casualties were lower than expected, but fierce resistance kept them from many of the day's objectives.       <br /> <br />This is essentially an oral history and soldiers' story; students of military history wanting in-depth details of strategy and deployments should look elsewhere.  Still, this is a superbly readable narrative of what the soldiers experienced on the beaches of Normandy.      <br /> <br />	2005-04-28

Celso works two years on a ranch, only to lose most of his savings in a quasi-legal swindle.  He then undertakes a dangerous trip into the jungle, and contracts to work in a jungle logging camp - called a Monteria.  After two years of ceaseless labor on the Monteria he tries to return home with his savings to marry.  Once again he is cheated, this time by an under-handed conspiracy involving agents, contractors, and the law.  Celso then tries to adjust to his situation as he joins the forced march of fellow pseudo-slaves deep into the jungle to their new Monteria.  Readers quickly identify with Celso as he attempts to control his life despite an unfair system that repeatedly cheats and abuses people like him.<br /><br />Author B. Traven (1890-1969) wrote with great sympathy for the impoverished Indians of Mexico, as well as other exploited workers.  Traven held leftist/anarchist views, and as usual, exposes the dark sides of human nature, racial bigotry, and capitalist exploitation.	2005-04-28

As the author shows, extremists on all sides were too often in control, and this worked to prevent the nation's political system from finding workable compromises.  The author describes the pressures behind secession, and shows how slavery was the one bone of contention between North and South that proved most resistant to compromise.        <br /> <br />Catton also shows the political maneuvering (north and south) that occurred in the weeks after Lincoln's inauguration prior to Fort Sumter - the new President now realizing that it would probably take war to restore the fractured union.  Readers also get a solid look at the political maneuvering in the first months of the war on up through the Battle of Bull Run (Manassas).  We also see Lincoln's skillful (if heavy-handed) moves to keep the vital Border States in the Union.        <br /> <br />\\"The Coming Fury\\" is the author's most political and least military volume on the Civil War.

We see the nightmare of the Korean War and McCarthyism up close, while learning how the growth of television changed the nation politically and socially.   We see how companies like McDonald's evolved in an increasingly car-oriented, suburban culture. The author also examines the early civil rights movement, and the great migration of blacks from rural south to urban north (where their problems often continued).   <br /> <br />Many look back at the 1950's as a time of serenity, but the author shows that the bygone decade had stresses and a turbulent undercurrent that came to a head a decade later.  Readers can almost pick chapters at random and learn as much as reading straight through.   <br /> <br />Halberstam has done an excellent job.

Those vignettes were primarily concerned with life in the USA, growing up in New York City, and running a newspaper in Charlotte, North Carolina.  Perhaps it was the author's attention to family stability, the church, his Jewish heritage, and similar issues that gave his paper a national following, particularly among the clergy.

Royko could be funny, satiric, sympathetic, self-deprecating, angry and irreverent - often in the same column.  He believed in fair play, and stood up for the abused citizen and the little guy.  Some say that Royko defined Chicago as the voice of the average man; middle class but burdened by taxes, job stress, family pressures, plus worries about health and crime. Sometimes Royko invoked his alter ego Slats Grobnik to make strong points, and he often poked fun at blowhard politicians and arrogant bureaucrats.  I particularly enjoyed his columns about an 83-year old man who refused to exit a bus until the driver refunded his quarter, his successful attack on the Veteran's Administration for brushing off a disabled veteran, and his amusing reply to an angry letter from Frank Sinatra.  <br /> <br />This particular compilation is of daily columns he wrote for the Chicago Daily News and Chicago Sun-Times from 1973-1982.

The book is one of several superbly readable volumes on the Civil War by author/historian Bruce Catton (1899-1978).   <br /> <br />This narrative covers the Army of the Potomac from the start of the brutal 1864 wilderness campaign through the war's end a year later at Appomattox.  The author shows that General Ulysses S. Grant was more capable than brilliant, and fiercely determined to keep the pressure on General Lee's rebel army until the Confederates had no choice but to quit.  Given the Union's advantage in men and material, the strategy made sense.  What was less sensible were costly errors by Union officers, frightful casualties, and a sickening Union failure to clinch victory on the first day at Petersburg (thus reducing carnage on both sides).  <br /> <br />The author perused many soldier diaries and letters to show us the life of the average Union enlisted man.  That soldier was well-paid ($16 a month), but forced to endure boredom, rough weather, marching, stress, and dangers from disease and a tough, determined enemy.    <br /> <br />This moving look at the last year of conflict is probably the best of Catton's narratives on the Civil War.    <br />	2005-04-12

Brosnan writes with the same wit and amused irreverence he used two years earlier in his superb initial diary, THE LONG SEASON.  Here we get an insider's view of star teammates like Frank Robinson (that year's MVP), Vada Pinson, Jim Maloney, manager Fred Hutchinson, etc.  Readers will enjoy hearing about now-forgotten players in long-gone ballparks like Crosley Field, Shibe Park, Forbes Field, etc.  We also get the tension and thrill of a pennant race.  Unfortunately, the author omits spring training, and he ends the diary on the last day of the regular season, before the Reds played the Yankees in that year's World Series - thus I gave the book just four stars instead of five.    <br /> <br />Brosnan was a college-educated player who gained recognition (and notoriety) for his writing.  PENNANT RACE is as readable and charming as its predecessor, and once again landed Brosnan in some hot water with baseball's establishment.      <br />	2005-04-12

Stumbling upon a suicide attempt, Mark accidentally acquires information about a mob murder of a U.S. senator.  This unwanted knowledge makes Mark of keen interest to both the FBI and the New Orleans crime syndicate.  The young man soon realizes that his survival may depend on every ounce of his young wit and intelligence.  Mark enlists the support of attorney Reggie Love, and she quickly becomes his sturdy protector, partner, and grandmother figure.  These two staunch allies then work to elude the mob, avoid the FBI, and even promote justice in their own way.  I particularly liked how Mark's maturity and skepticism guide his every action.  Author John Grisham isn't Shakespeare, but he's written a remarkably charming thriller.   <br />  <br />	2005-04-12

Shirer wrote this engaging account for young readers, yet it's a pretty good (if brief) read for adults.  The narrative describes the launching of Germany's greatest battleship in early 1941, and the panicked British response to sink the Bismarck before she wreaked havoc on Allied convoys.  The story begins as British intelligence learns that the Bismarck has left port and will soon head for the Atlantic Ocean to attack vital convoys from America and Canada.  Then there's the effort to intercept it with British battleships Hood and Prince of Wales, Bismarck's escape into the open sea, and eventually, the final engagement.  Battleships were on the road to obsolescence in 1941 - unless they had sufficient air cover - but that was not yet fully understood by the admiralty, nor is it a theme of this thrilling high seas tale of hunt and prey.    <br /> <br />William L. Shirer (1904-93) wrote several superb volumes on Nazi Germany aimed at adults: Berlin Diary, Rise and Fall of Third Reich, Nightmare Years.  This is a stellar effort he penned for younger readers.     <br />	2005-04-09

Army from the Normandy Beaches to the Bulge to the Surrender of Germany	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Readers feel as if they are there....	This is a highly readable look at the American GI's that fought in Europe from beaches of Normandy (June 1944) on through victory in Germany eleven months later.   Author/Historian Stephen Ambrose (1936-2002) interviewed many veterans to write this moving narrative.            <br /> <br />Ambrose makes us feel as if we are right there alongside the infantry as they trudge forward, dig foxholes, gripe constantly, and on occasion fight like demons.  The author had enormous respect for these front line \\"Willies and Joes\\" as GI cartoonist Bill Maudlin called them.  We meet farm boys, school dropouts, teachers, factory hands, engineers, and others who fought less out of hatred of Nazism than from a desire not to let their buddies down.  These men seldom confessed their patriotism, being more concerned with clean socks, decent chow, and a warm place to sleep.  This book should give readers an understanding of post-traumatic stress, and a respectful realization why so many veterans never speak (or spoke) of their wartime experiences.     <br /> <br />Ambrose interviewed thousands of U.S. veterans to write his many narratives on the combat veterans of that horrific conflict.  His approach provides an engaging look at the front lines, although for a detailed look at the \\"big picture\\" one may need to look elsewhere.  Still, this is a very engaging look at the war from those who manned the front lines.     <br />  <br />	2005-04-09

It's the story of six socially awkward teenage males who end up sharing a cabin at Box Canyon Boys Camp one summer.  The macho, competitive camp in Arizona tolerates no fools or losers, and its motto is, \\"We'll send you a cowboy.\\"  Not surprisingly, these socially awkward young men don't fit in.  But they find some salvation though their leader, 15-year old John Cotton, a tough but decent young rebel. Cotton's qualities prove invaluable even before the six teens sneak out of camp one night on a law-breaking journey.  Their goal is to rescue some doomed buffalo due to be shot in the morning by fee-paying hunters - animals that the young misfits identify with.  Along the way the young men overcome challenges and risks with teamwork, a sign that Cotton's leadership has paid off.  The author freely inserts flashbacks that identify the problems of each young man - including pathological jealousy, delinquency, weakness, etc.   <br /> <br />This story was written in an era of socially relevant novels that attacked the status quo.  This is very engaging reading, and one of the few books that we had to read in high school English class that I actually found useful.  <br />	2005-04-07

The author focuses more heavily on a couple of those seasons, with tidbits on star players (Jackie Robinson, Joe DiMaggio, Willie Mays, Mickey Mantle, Pee Wee Reese, etc.), team owners, sports writers and managers.  I particularly liked the author's coverage of the 1947 season and 1951 Giant/Dodgers playoff.  He also gives us a sense of business, including the rise of Walter O'Malley, the falling of attendance during the era, and the machinations that resulted in the Dodgers and Giants deserting the city for California.   <br /> <br />This readable book has its flaws.  The author's coverage of each season is out of balance, he suggests that Willie Mays was the game's top player (in the 1950's Mantle was probably better), and he shows no sense of the longing and bitterness in the many big-league cities where pennants are rarely if ever won.   <br /> <br />Kahn is a marvelous writer, but his readable prose never approaches the poetic level found in some of his other books (Boys of Summer, Flame or Pure Desire, Memories of Summer).  This book is definitely worth reading, but it falls a short of his best writing on baseball.      <br /> <br />	2005-04-07

Author John Steinbeck (1902-1968) examines the hardships faced by \\"Okies,\\" displaced farmers of the 1930's who headed for California and tried to scrape by as migrant workers.<br /><br />The story centers on the Joads, a family of destitute Oklahoma farmers that head for California in hopes of finding work as fruit pickers.  Death and misery accompany their journey, and things aren't much better once they arrive.  The people (and law) in California fear and mistreat newcomers, and what little work is available invariably involves long hours and poverty-level wages.  The only time the Joads get respect is when they lodge at a modest U.S. Government camp for transients - the author once toured such camps with first lady Eleanor Roosevelt.  The book's ending is powerfully inconclusive, reflecting the sturdy will of people to endure hardship as the Great Depression drags on.<br /><br />This book captured the 1939 Pulitzer Prize.  It was also turned into the classic 1940 movie starring Henry Fonda - a movie that was often filmed in secret due to lingering resentment against \\"Okies.\\"  I gave the book just four stars because in places it lags a bit, but it remains a powerful statement for caring government and help for the dispossessed.	2005-04-07

Daley (1902-1976) of Chicago is critical, informative, and realistic. Author Len O'Connor (1912-1991) was a local reporter who covered the local political scene for nearly four decades.    Here he begins by covering Daley's youth and steady rise to the top, then his long tenure as mayor (1955-1976) and political leader.  O'Connor finds fault with Daley and the corrupt Chicago political machine, yet also acknowledges the man's achievements.  This book is often critical of Daley, but it never drops down to a hatchet job.  Overall it's a rather realistic look at the politics of the nation's second city. <br /> <br />This book came out shortly before Daley's years in office ended with his passing in late 1976.  Readers should also consider BOSS by Mike Royko, a more harshly critical but engaging look at the mayor.    <br />	2005-04-06

The author describes the daily life of police officers in the city of Philadelphia in the 1970's.  We get a feel for what it is like to be an everyday patrolman; you have power and responsibility, you are feared by some, respected by many, hated by others.  We see how cops alter their law enforcement style to fit the neighborhood standards, and how some officers are jerks while others have big hearts.  We also see what risks cops look for (and those they basically ignore), how they gather information, etc.<br /><br />This book is a bit dated, and the author never mentions Frank Rizzo, then the city's controversial police commissioner (and later its Mayor).  Still, this is a realistic book, drawn from the author having spent countless hours talking and riding with Philadelphia patrolmen.  This is good reading for anybody interested in learning more about law enforcement.	2005-04-06

White (1915-1986) covered U.S. Presidential elections for more than a quarter of a century.  Here in his final book he examines the political changes from 1956-1980, then finishes with a concise look at the 1980 campaign between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan.  <br /> <br />White begins with a lengthy examination of the major changes in the U.S. during the quarter century from 1956-1980.  He seems almost depressed by national problems such as energy dependency, urban crime, inflation and affirmative action.  Readers see how TV sound bites have replaced political dialog, and how political conventions changed from nominating bodies to rubber stamps.     <br /> <br />The book's second half covers the 1980 election campaign between Carter, Reagan, and third-party candidate John Anderson.   The author offers substantial analysis in a campaign that was probably a foregone conclusion.  With Carter weakened by inflation, gas lines, hostages in Iran, and a primary challenge from Ted Kennedy, all Reagan had to do was convince people he wasn't an extremist.   <br /> <br />Theodore H. White was a master political journalist, and author of the superb \\"Making of the President\\" series from 1960-1972.  His final book was also very good, but probably not quite up to the standards of his best earlier writings.    <br />	2005-04-06

The author shows that the New York Yankees were hobbled by injuries to key players (including Joe DiMaggio) for significant parts of the season, while a somewhat healthier Boston Red Sox team fought for the pennant with a slightly weaker roster.  Readers feel the excitement as the late season pennant race came down to the last two games of the season at Yankee stadium - with Boston needing one victory there to clinch the pennant.  The author takes a nice look at the major figures in this pennant race; Joe and Dom DiMaggio (on opposing teams), Ted Williams (harassed by parts of the Boston media), Allie Reynolds, Johnny Pesky, Yogi Berra, etc.  Readers get a feel for the personalities, the pennant race, and the state of life and baseball in that bygone era.  These were two great teams that could have been even better had their front offices not refused to integrate two years after Jackie Robinson arrived in Brooklyn.        <br /> <br />Halberstam used lengthy interviews with surviving players to write this highly engaging narrative decades after the fact.  I give the book just four stars due to some factual errors noted by previous reviewers (and stats guru Bill James). Still, this is an engrossing narrative about baseball when that sport was clearly on top.       <br />	2005-04-03

The book focuses on one seemingly unimportant mid-season 1982 contest between the Baltimore Orioles and the Milwaukee Brewers.  As author Daniel Okrent recounts the game, he weaves in such baseball lore as the history of the slider, player behavior in the locker rooms, catcher's signals, scouting, etc.  Every chapter covers an inning, and every inning leads to lengthy sidebars on many facets of baseball.  The book is a bit dated, but Okrent's prose and subject matter make important reading for any fan wanting to know about the nuts and bolts of baseball.  Some may not like that the author focuses more heavily on the Brewers, who won that year's AL pennant (Baltimore took the World Series a year later). Fittingly, these two teams battled each other in the season's final game to decide the division title. Fans will learn a lot about baseball from this engaging and thoughtful book.	2005-04-02

As the author shows, George Herman Ruth was the rowdy son of a Baltimore saloon-keeper, a young man that spent years in reform school.  Gifted with incredible baseball talent, the Babe joined the Red Sox in 1914 and was soon the top left-handed pitcher in the American League.  As the author shows, Ruth's prodigious batting eventually led him from the mound to everyday status as an outfielder.  After Boston's owner foolishly dealt him to the Yankees prior to the 1920 season, Ruth exploded onto the scene in the nation's largest city by hitting 54 homers - more than any other team in the league.  Creamer shows us how media attention, radio, movies, and Ruth's love of the spotlight helped to make him into a national icon.  The author also spares little in showing the Babe's flaws; his rowdy volatility and his self-indulgent night life and skirt chasing.  But we also see how the Babe loved kids and could be very warm and engaging.       <br /> <br />Readers might also enjoy Creamer's biography on Casey Stengel and his narrative of baseball in 1941 (BASEBALL AND OTHER MATTERS).  This is an excellent biography by a talented writer.  <br />	2005-04-02

Henry (Hank) Aaron speaks with an impressive dignity, in a book he wrote (with Lonnie Wheeler) 15 years after his playing days ended.  Aaron describes his early life, from growing up in the segregated south, to playing as a teen for the then-declining Negro leagues, to his helping integrate the minor leagues down south.  He then describes reaching the majors in 1954 at age 20, where he was soon a superstar on the powerhouse Milwaukee Braves teams of Eddie Mathews, Warren Spahn, Lew Burdette, etc. Aaron recalls being well-treated by the Milwaukee fans, in contrast to the reception he received after the team moved to Atlanta in 1966.  He also describes the pressure as he neared Babe Ruth's home run record in 1973-74, including hate mail and even death threats.  Racism had a hand in many of Aaron's experiences as a player and baseball executive, and he leaves an impression by confronting prejudice in a firm but reasoned manner.      <br /> <br />Hank Aaron was a calm, steady, not-that-colorful superstar playing in smaller markets.  For these reasons he never got the attention of other star players (at least before his home run chase).  Aaron isn't perfect, but he speaks with dignity and class.  This is an impressive biography by an impressive man.    <br />	2005-03-31

White chronicles the campaign in a year when everything seemed to go wrong.  As the author shows, 1968 saw stalemate in Vietnam, campus unrest, race riots, rising crime, and assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy. White captures the flavor of the campaign, beginning with President Lyndon Johnson, whose popularity had fallen so far that he quit the race and rarely left the White House.  I felt the author went too easy on Richard Nixon's questionable law and order campaign (and lack of specifics on Vietnam), but his description of Nixon's comeback is otherwise on target.  We see Democratic nominee Hubert Humphrey's as a decent, well-qualified candidate whose narrow loss may have stemmed from the convention riots in Chicago.  The author drops all objectivity in his disdainful look at third-party candidate George Wallace, whose race-baiting campaign won five southern states and nearly 10 million votes nationwide.  The book isn't perfect, but it captures the tenure of the times; a nation awash in wealth yet troubled by war and violence.  <br /> <br />Theodore H. White (1915-1986) was a superb chronicler of U.S. politics during Presidential campaigns (1960-1972, plus 1980).  Despite minor flaws, this superbly readable book captures the tenure of the USA in that troubled year.     <br />	2005-03-31

Cleveland shortstop Ray Chapman (1891-1920) succumbed after being hit in the head by Yankee hurler Carl Mays (1891-1971) late in the 1920 season.  Mays threw hard and pitched inside, but was he guilty of killing or merely the possessor of an accidental hand in tragedy?  The author leans to the latter view, but presents a balanced look.  Readers get a nice feel for baseball in 1920, when TV and radio didn't exist, crowds were smaller, and players didn't wear helmets.  We see that back then the game had its controversies, including labor disputes and fights over money.  The author also looks at future hall of fame shortstop Joe Sewell (1898-1990), who replaced Chapman and helped the Indians win that year's Pennant and World Series - Cleveland edging out Chicago when eight White Sox players were suspended late in the season as the 1919 World Series scandal was uncovered.  This narrative offers controversy, history, and personality, and is well worth reading.	2005-03-31

It's the story of Roy Hobbs, an incredibly talented player from somewhere out west who through tragic circumstance doesn't reach the majors until he's in his mid-thirties.  Hobbs is a decent sort, but he finds himself overwhelmed by fame, manipulative owners, merciless sportswriters, and conniving women.  His career with the fictional New York Knights is meteoric but short, and filled with controversy and temptation.  Hobb's impact catapults his team into the pennant race, and the story improves as it unfolds.   <br /> <br />The book has a symbolic, semi-mythical style.  The story was based partly on a 1949 incident involving Eddie Waitkus of the Phillies.  This book is also tougher and less optimistic than the 1984 movie starring Robert Redford.  <br />	2005-03-30

White on U.S. presidential campaigns from 1960-1972, and the volume is tougher and less romantic than its best-selling 1960 predecessor.  White describes both the political scene and the state of the nation in 1964.  To begin, the author looks at President Lyndon Johnson's brief tenure in office following the Kennedy assassination.  With the nation at peace and the economy booming, Johnson was practically a shoo-in for re-election.  So the author concentrates heavily on the conservative insurgency that got Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona the Republican nomination.  White does an equally good job describing the state of the nation that year, particularly the increasingly successful Civil Rights movement and the increasingly tragic violence and dysfunction of the black underclass.  White also missed cues like the conservative ascendancy in the GOP, and the turn of the South to the GOP because of racial issues.  Additionally, the author's admiration for Johnson seems to have shielded him from the man's enormous ego - a weakness that can drag leaders and nations into trouble.  <br /> <br />Author Theodore H. White (1915-1986) was a superb political journalist, and few have ever matched his chronicles of U.S. politics.  This book isn't his best effort, but it's clearly a valuable one. <br /> <br />	2005-03-30

Mantle was neither intellectually gifted nor particularly insightful - in these pages he comes across as plain and somewhat humble.  Imagine the American League's biggest star running a family bowling alley in Dallas during off seasons in those days of modest salaries.  Mantle tells of his antics with his teammates, the thrill of key games, trips overseas, etc.  The superstar from Commerce Oklahoma was more responsible for the loved and hated Yankee dynasty of the 1950's thru 1964 than anybody.  Mantle said he couldn't remember a single parade after another Yankee title - they were expected to win.  Compare that with the 86-year championship wait in Boston, or the long pennant droughts of the White Sox, Cubs, and other teams.      <br /> <br />This book came out in the mid-1980's and steers clear of the drinking problems that would lead to Mantle's death in 1995.   This is not a great autobiography, but it is an interesting look from a surprisingly humble man.  <br />	2005-03-30

This is very moving story of family, hardship, triumph and love.  The author begins by describing her maternal grandmother, who was a concubine for a warlord general during the tumultuous 1920's.  More attention is then paid to her idealistic parents, who joined the Communist Revolution of the 1940's but two decades later were denounced and double-crossed during the Cultural Revolution.  By that time the author was herself a witness to events, and we hear her story as well.  Jung Chang spent her teens as an enthused Maoist, until the abuses heaped on her father (and others) eventually led her to a different view.  Her family's efforts to maintain health and sanity given the dictates of Kuomintang, Japanese, and Maoist rulers shows why China is a compelling land of great tragedy.   <br /> <br />Women really connect with this superbly moving narrative, although it appeals to men as well.

White (1915-1986) always wrote with great eloquence, but never more so than in this superbly moving autobiography.  White begins by describing his impoverished boyhood in Boston's Jewish ghetto and his undergrad days (on scholarship) at Harvard in the 1930's.  He then writes with great passion about his years as a correspondent in war-torn China (1938-1945), which included working for Time Magazine, reporting on China's Nationalist government (and insurgent communists), and helping to curb a disastrous famine in Honan (Henan) province.  The author's attachment to the Middle Kingdom (China) has doubtless inspired several readers (including myself) to visit that enchanting yet oft-tragic nation.  White also describes reporting from post-war Europe 1948-1952, and his days as a returned U.S. journalist during the prosperous 1950's and beyond. Readers get a first-hand look such notables as Dwight Eisenhower, Mao Zedong, Chou En Lai, Douglas McArthur, Chiang Kai-Shek, Joe Stillwell, Konrad Adenauer, etc.  We also get an intimate look at John F. Kennedy from his 1960 run for the White House through his tragic death in November, 1963.  White concludes with a bittersweet account of returning to his once-tranquil boyhood home in 1976 - now deep in the troubled ghetto of violence and poverty.            Theodore H. White was one of the top journalists of the 20th Century, and perhaps best known for his MAKING OF THE PRESIDENT series (1960-1972).  Very few writers have ever matched his eloquent prose, which is abundant in this superbly moving 1978 memoir.	2005-03-21

The book is a compilation of anecdotes and pieces drawn from the Carolina Israelite, the author's little Charlotte (North Carolina) newspaper with a national reputation.  The anecdotes range from a couple sentences to several pages, with most being about one page or less in length.  These anecdotes cover a gamut of issues including family life, sex, tradition, New York City, small towns, Jewish life, the Church, immigration, segregation, and other facets of U.S. life.   Readers can learn much from Golden, who was blessed with writing talent, a good memory, and common sense.  This book is largely humorous and nostalgic, but at times is quite serious.  So was his newspaper, which was one of the few in the south that dared to oppose segregation in the 1950's.    <br /> <br />Golden was raised in New York City before moving as an adult (with a record) to Charlotte, North Carolina.  His small paper had a national following, and was said to be popular among Christian clergy.  This best-selling 1958 book was followed by FOR 2 CENTS PLAIN, ENJOY, ENJOY, plus several other volumes.   <br />	2005-03-21

Truman	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Candid and Engaging Biography	This candid biography was drawn from never-aired TV interviews filmed in early 1962 when former U.S. President Harry Truman was 77 and retired nine years.  Harry S. Truman (1884-1972) had character, courage, and strong views, as is evident on each page.  Truman provides straight answers to questions about his childhood, military service, and days as County Administrator, Senator (which Truman liked best), and President (1945-1953).  Truman easily discusses tough issues like dropping the bomb on Japan, the Marshall Plan, and Korea.  He praises associates Omar Bradley, Dean Acheson, Herbert Hoover, and especially George Marshall.  He also shows scorn for wealthy special interests, Douglas McArthur (\\"Mr. Brass Hat\\"), Dwight Eisenhower (\\"difficult\\"), Richard Nixon (\\"Shifty-eyed...Liar\\"), and sees President Kennedy as capable but too young.  Truman lacked a college education, but we see how his prolific reading in history and literature proved invaluable.  The author/interviewer speaks with some of Truman's friends and relatives, but no critics, and he seldom challenges the President's responses as a good interviewer occasionally must.  As a result, this highly engaging book is a bit thin and one-sided.              <br /> <br />Merle Miller (1919-1984) admitted that during the course of these interviews he went from Truman skeptic to fan.  This is an engaging and revealing look at one of America's better President's.    <br />	2005-03-21

It's the story of Santiago, an aged subsistence fisherman in Cuba around 1950.  The old man plies his trade from a tiny boat, but hasn't caught a fish in months.  His near-destitution forces him to lose the assistance of his devoted boy helper, so now he goes out alone.  Sure enough, he hooks a giant marlin, one that pulls and fights and drags the old man out to sea.  The old man professes love and respect for his catch, but remains determined to kill it.  Of course, if he succeeds in that difficult physical struggle, he will need further effort to keep his catch away from sharks.  Hemingway aptly describes the fears, hopes, and frustrations the old man feels as he struggles for days to land and bring home his prize catch in that tiny boat.   <br /> <br />This book led author Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961) to a Nobel Prize.  The author uses crisp and readable prose, and avoids the too-lengthy descriptions that detract from some of his earlier work.  This is a powerful story about physical and mental challenge, age, dreams and effort.     <br />	2005-03-21

The story centers on Wang Lung, an impoverished young peasant working the land before and during the Chinese Revolution of the 1910-1920's.  Wang Lung purchases a wife (O-Lan), and together they work long hours tilling the soil to which they are tied both physically and spiritually.  The couple endures hardship and nearly ceaseless labor without complaint, until over a period of years their efforts and good luck lead them to own more land and escape poverty.  Yet happiness proves fleeting for Wang, whether from fears of violence and societal change, his increasing greed, or the differing ambitions of his sons.  O-Lan proves to be a self-less and invaluable partner, and she finds some contentment despite a tough life of bound feet and subservience.  Sadly, Wang is too jaded by pride to recognize O-Lan's vital contribution to the family's success.<br /><br />Pearl Buck won the 1932 Pulitzer Prize for this enduring story, one that retains its power despite the vast changes that have swept China (and the world) since the 1930's.  An American raised in China, Buck's sympathetic prose gives readers a feel for the customs and traditions of that remarkable yet tragic land.	2005-03-21

Shirer (1904-1993) provides a superbly personal look at life inside Nazi Germany.  Shirer was stationed in Berlin from 1934-1940, watching and reporting as Hitler crushed freedom, rearmed the German military, and eventually launched his devastating war of conquest.  Readers feel like they are right there as events unfolded; from the Nuremburg rallies, to the Rhineland, the sellout at Munich, and the first year of World War II.  The author sensed danger from Hitler early on, while too many others embraced appeasement or isolationism.  Shirer returned home in early 1941, and within months his diary was the year's top selling non-fiction, boosting interventionist sentiment prior to Pearl Harbor.  I particularly liked the author's eyewitness accounts and his quiet outrage at Nazi abuses.      <br /> <br />BERLIN DIARY is readable, gripping, and inconclusive - it was published while Hitler held most of Europe.  The tenor of the times is provided in the last line of Shirer's introduction: \\"The Gestapo will find no clues.\\"     <br />	2005-03-20

White (1915-1986) captured the excitement of the Presidential campaign (and the Pulitzer Prize) with this romantic look at the 1960 race between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon.  White spent a year on the campaign trail, and his prose makes readers feel as if they're alongside the two young candidates as history plays out.  Kennedy was just 43, brilliant, charming and charismatic, while at 47, Nixon was a brooding introvert, but also highly capable.  We meet also-rans like Lyndon B. Johnson, Hubert Humphrey, Adlai Stevenson and Nelson Rockefeller.  We also see the moves of king-makers like Chicago's mayor Richard Daley and Governor David Lawrence (Pennsylvania) in an era where party conventions still chose candidates. Readers get a look at then-vital issues such as religion (Kennedy was Catholic), the Cold War, civil rights, and the effect of the first TV debates in that black-and-white era when quite a few homes still lacked television.  Then there's the sprint to finish line as the candidates crisscross the nation in frenzied stumps for votes.  Finally, we experience the suspense of election night as the close vote is slowly tallied, ending with a razor-thin margin for Kennedy after the sun rose the next morning.<br /><br />This superb best-seller isn't flawless.  The author favors Kennedy and discounts (or ignores) charges that he was a rich and under-prepared playboy, while also forgiving Nixon's red-baiting, \\"Tricky Dick\\" style.  Still, THE MAKING OF THE PRESIDENT is an exciting read, and a more optimistic volume than the three nearly-as-good versions the author wrote after the 1964, 1968, and 1972 campaigns.	2005-03-19

Bill Veeck (1914-1986) was an innovative baseball owner who bucked the establishment, disdained stuffed shirts, and was full of ideas and enthusiasm.  Here he tells his story, from a Chicago boyhood (his father ran the Cubs), to ownership of the then minor-league Milwaukee Brewers in the early 1940's.  From there he describes running the Cleveland Indians (including their 1948 championship), the old St. Louis Browns and the Chicago White Sox (a team he owned twice). Readers get a sense of the baseball controversies that existed a few decades ago, and see what it was like to run a sports franchise in the days before free agency drove up player salaries.  Veeck had his faults, but he loved baseball, disdained arrogance, opposed racism, and strived to give his fans their money's worth.  Among his innovations are exploding scoreboards, player names on the uniforms, fireworks, and of course, sending a midget up to bat (he walked on four pitches).  <br /> <br />VEECK AS IN WRECK is a bit dated since it was first published in the early 1960's, but Veeck's enthusiasm and collaborator Ed Linn's prose makes for a fun and entertaining read.   <br />	2005-03-16

A U.S. merchant sailor finds himself stranded in 1920's Europe without a passport or his seaman's card after his ship leaves without him (his documents are aboard the ship).  Without his ID he finds himself an outcast, an unwelcome vagabond that ships won't hire, nations don't want, and whom U.S. Consuls brush off.  Broke, stranded and desperate, he eventually finds work aboard the Yorikke.  That vessel is called a death ship for its dangerous hard work, meager pay, and atrocious conditions.  Our hero can only hope that the Yorikke will eventually set anchor in a U.S. port - but that could take months or years.  There is a certain Franz Kafka/Twilight Zone quality to this story of a little man trapped by an unfair system.  I felt the novel story got better in the second half, as our friend adjusts to his difficult situation only to find himself in great danger.<br /><br />Chicago-born author B. Traven (1890-1969) lived secretly, wrote readable prose, and didn't hide his contempt for the effects of government rules and unregulated capitalism on ordinary people.  This story doesn't match his TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE, but it makes for a solid read.	2005-03-14

Heavyweight Jack Dempsey (1895-1983) was a charismatic champion from 1919-1926, at a time when sports and media expanded onto the American scene.  The story sketches Dempsey's hard scrabble, brawling western upbringing, and then focuses on his struggle to reach and to remain on top.  The author shows how the U.S. sports media came into its own in that era of Babe Ruth, Red Grange, Bill Tilden, and Bobby Jones, plus writers like Grantland Rice, Ring Lardner, Damon Runyon, etc.  Readers also see how the amount of money skyrocketed along with media coverage.  Dempsey earned $27,000 when he won the title from Jess Willard in 1919, a pittance compared to the $1.5 million he split in his rematch with Gene Tunney eight years later.  The author examines the controversial \\"long count\\" at that 1927 rematch in Chicago's Soldier Field (attendance: 104,000), and hints that the referee may have been paid off.  The book concludes with a brief look at Dempsey's later years, when the champ with the big heart ran a famous restaurant on New York's Times Square.   <br /> <br />Author Roger Kahn has put together another superb look at sports.  Some feel Kahn went too easy on Dempsey by not stressing the champ's unsavory side, but neither does the author avoid the issue.  Readers should enjoy this biography as much as some of the author's other superb volumes.      <br />	2005-03-14

Durocher begins by describing his boyhood in Springfield, Massachusetts, his 1925 debut on Babe Ruth's Yankees, and his days as a slick-glove shortstop with Cincinnati, St. Louis, and Brooklyn. But Durocher was better known for his years as team manager.  Here he aptly recounts his years as team skipper beginning with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1938, moving to the Giants, Cubs, and finally ending when he resigned from the Houston Astros in 1973.  Durocher introduces us to teammates like Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Dizzy Dean, Jackie Robinson, Ernie Banks and Billy Williams, plus his personal favorites Willie Mays and Pete Reiser. We also meet baseball executives like Branch Rickey, Larry McPhail, and Phil Wrigley. Readers get Durocher's views on many significant events that occurred during his half-century in baseball.  He also takes a few swings at his critics, and on occasion reflects on his own shortcomings.            <br /> <br />This is a solid autobiography by one of the game's most colorful and controversial figures.  Durocher tells his side of the story in entertaining style under the readable prose of collaborator Ed Linn.   <br />	2005-03-14

Author Mario Puzo (1920-1999) advances few noble ideas, but his story about New York's Corleone mafia family of the 1940's is just so...gripping.  The themes, of course, are timeless; power, greed, family loyalty, betrayal, revenge.  The story centers on syndicate Godfather Vito Corleone, and the eventual transfer of power to his initially reluctant son Michael. The peripheral characters are nearly as compelling; hot-headed Santino, reserved Tom Hagen, dangerous Virgil Sollozo, and innocent Kay Adams.  Puzo shows us how organized crime has its hands into many pies, including businesses, politics and finance.  I'd have liked less attention paid to the sexual antics of the Hollywood crowd, but the author makes every page interesting.  The book provides an excellent companion to the Oscar-winning 1972 movie (or vice versa), and covers many details that the film had no time for.   <br />Since first published in 1969, THE GODFATHER has been the top selling novel worldwide or very close to it.  Writers should read these pages to learn about gripping, readable prose.  Sadly, the author seemed unable to repeat his success with his other mob-related novels.    <br />	2005-03-13

William L. Shirer (1904-1993) lived a remarkably full life, and at age 85 retained the immense talents that ranked him among our top journalist/historians.  Here he recounts returning to a defeated Berlin in 1945, his firing by CBS News (told quite differently elsewhere), and his struggle to write RISE AND FALL OF THE THIRD REICH while semi-blacklisted and half-broke in the late 1950's.  Shirer also takes a limited look at the events of the 1970's and 1980's, describes his prolific seniority, and pays tribute to friends lost to advancing years.  The author's bittersweet account of his final visit to Paris 60 years after having first lived there in the 1920's speaks volumes.  This journalist-turned-author was a perceptive realist, somewhat headstrong and pessimistic, and well seasoned by wine, women and song.  Writing that wonderfully readable prose of old newspapermen, Shirer certainly left his mark - as had been predicted in his college days by a long-forgotten editor back in Cedar Rapids, Iowa (see THE START).       This final memoir is perhaps best once you've gotten a sense of the man from his earlier memoirs and other stellar books.  Not knowing that he'd live to finish another book (on Tolstoy), Shirer's final passages are a moving farewell.  As he states, \\"...it was an interesting fate to be an American in the Twentieth Century...I am glad it was mine.\\"	2005-03-13

Author Roger Kahn grew up with the Brooklyn Dodgers, and covered that legendary team in the early 1950's as a young reporter for the old New York Herald Tribune.  Kahn lets us get to know the team's outstanding figures, from gruff skipper Charlie Dressen, to baseball legend Jackie Robinson, to stars like Duke Snider, Pee Wee Reese, Roy Campanella, Gil Hodges, Carl Erskine, etc.  Readers should enjoy the author's sentimental look at Brooklyn prior to urban decline and the Dodger's inexcusable desertion to Los Angeles.  Kahn also grants a strong role in the narrative to his baseball-loving father.  Readers will learn (or be reminded of) baseball in a drug-free era of modest player salaries and loveable ballparks like Ebbets Field.  In the books second half the author interviews the former Dodger players twenty years later.  Hardship and tragedy followed several players into their middle age, yet most retained their gentle humanity long after they'd been returned them to the ranks of ordinary men.  <br />   <br />THE BOYS OF SUMMER was published in 1972, yet remains one of the best baseball books ever written.

Rebelling against the middle class values of her Chinese immigrant parents, Wong left for China in the early 1970's as an eager young Maoist.  The author describes her student days at Beijing University, her life on a rural farm commune, and her eventual transformation from nave idealist to disillusioned realist.  Wong left for home six years later, but returned to Beijing in 1988 as foreign correspondent for the Toronto Globe Mail.  There she witnessed the stunning prosperity China suddenly enjoyed along with the tragedy of Tiananmen Square.

Yakov Bok is a poor Jewish handyman from Kiev falsely accused of blood libel - killing a Christian child in order to use his blood to make Passover Matzos.  Such false charges were not unheard of in Eastern Europe during periods of anti-Semitism.  Readers feel as if they are practically beside Bok as he sits in prison, isolated, frustrated, and clinging desperately to hope that his innocence will somehow be demonstrated.  Bok must also contend with his previously unhappy life, his lack of faith, a wife who left him, and anger from some inside prison who believe the charges.  Bok's sanity and sturdiness waiver under the stress of his predicament, and he struggles to retain his sanity and compassion.           <br /> <br />This powerful tale was partly based on the case of Mendel Beilis, a Jew from Tsarist Russia who was acquitted of the same false charge in 1913 after having spent two years in prison.  This is a superb tale injustice, and the mental struggle of an individual to survive the ordeal of false imprisonment.      <br />	2005-03-08

The authors developed 13 True/False questions (Keys) on the U.S. economy, foreign policy, and other political matters.  They then apply these 13 Keys to every Presidential contest from the start of the two-party system in the 1850's up through modern times.  Readers see that whenever eight (8) or more Keys are true on Election Day, the candidate of the party holding the White House has won the popular vote.  Whenever fewer than eight Keys are true, the challenger triumphed. Unfortunately, the Keys only predict popular vote, and on three different occasions (1876, 1888, 2000) the candidate with the most popular votes still lost in the Electoral College. Nevertheless, the 13 Keys correspond with the popular vote winner in every Presidential election from 1860 (Lincoln over Douglas, Breckenridge & Bell) through 1988 (Bush Sr. over Dukakis), the last contest before this book was published.  And at this (updated) writing the Keys remain true, having forecast popular vote wins by Bill Clinton (1992 & 1996), Al Gore (2000), George W. Bush (2004) and Barack Obama (2008 & 2012) - that's 38 straight elections!<br /><br />Authors Allan Litchman and Ken DeCell make a strong case that their 13 Keys are vital, while arguing that campaigns are largely irrelevant - a claim some will no doubt debate. Regardless of your view, THE THIRTEEN KEYS is a valuable and prophetic read.	2005-03-08

Authors Rod Thorn and Pete Palmer wrote this book in 1983, as the home computer was coming in, and following on the heels of statistical guru Bill James.  Unlike most sportswriters and ice-age baseball men, the authors understood why on-base-percentage and slugging percentage are keys while batting average means little.  The authors examine the statistics of several key players, and show us what to look for.  I mention flaws because their linear weights system of measuring players is rather flawed - Roy Smalley Jr. was NOT one of the top 100 players of all time.  Despite some flaws in methodology, the authors were on the right track, and improved with their TOTAL BASEBALL books that followed.    <br /> <br />Readers of this book should also look at just about anything written by Bill James.	2005-03-08

Lieutenant Frederick Henry (Tenente) is an American serving in the Italian army in 1917.  Henry is rather rugged and callous, and when he meets an attractive British nurse named Catherine Barkley his only thoughts are about using her for sensual pleasure.  Soon, however, the two fall deeply in love.  As war rages the two spend time together while Henry recovers from wounds, then they are separated only to meet again.  Readers never learn much about their hometowns or former lives - perhaps this is done to show how war can blur identities and bonds with the past.  Readers also see how Henry and his comrades are sick of the war's cruelties and injustices.  That disillusionment eventually leads Henry to desert and try to flee to neutral Switzerland with Catherine.<br /><br />This moving novel, first published in 1929, has remained popular to this day. Hemingway's prose illustrates hope, tragedy, loss, and the affect of war on ordinary people caught up in events.  I sometimes see Hemingway as over-rated, but this is clearly one of his best efforts.	2005-03-08

US	49935455	R1FEIMGDE4JE7X	0553272535	88900905	Night	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Tragic, Gripping, Moving	This concise and moving autobiographical novel by (1986 Nobel Prize winner) Ellie Wiesel makes a powerful statement.  Wiesel was a Jewish teenager living with his family in the village of Sighet, Rumania in 1944 when the Germans came for them.  As it was, Wiesel describes surviving Nazi concentration camps while his family and neighbors were either killed outright or wasted away from hunger and disease.  We share the author's fears and survival instincts, and comprehend the callousness that he and his fellow inmates developed to maintain both their lives and their sanity.  Few statements about the Nazi holocaust against the Jews, Gypsies, and other \\"enemies of the state\\" are as poignant as this sorrow-filled account.  If anything, this readably moving account is too short.	2005-02-20

Author Iris Chang used official documents and interviews with aged survivors to narrate one of the most overlooked chapters of 20th Century genocide.  When Japan's imperial army captured the Chinese city of Nanking in 1937, their soldiers exacted a blood-thirsty revenge.  As this book shows, no Chinese were exempt from the seven-week orgy of murder and rape that followed.  Japanese soldiers used Chinese prisoners for bayonet practice, shot entire families, and raped women by the thousands (usually killing their victims afterwards).  Recoiling in horror, a handful of western officials, missionaries, and others (led ironically by diplomat John Rabe of Nazi Germany) worked to establish an international safe zone that saved thousands of Chinese.  Still this powerful narrative shows that Japan's army murdered an estimated 300,000 Chinese citizens in the space of less than two months.           Journalist/author Theodore H. White wrote similarly of Japanese atrocities in China during the war, but his writings are tame compared to this book.  Also, in the TV documentary American Century newsman Peter Jennings interviews an aged ex-Japanese soldier who admits to having particpated in these atrocities and to having felt no remorse until years later.  Author/journalist Iris Chang (1968-2004) tragically took her own life a few years after this book arrived - perhaps writing this narrative added to her burdens.	2005-02-19

Adelman focuses on a few teams, particularly the pennant winning Cincinnati Reds and Boston Red Sox.  The author also looks at individuals such as 85-year old Casey Stengel (who died that September) and San Diego pitcher Randy Jones.  The book's heart comes towards the end, with an informative account of the thrilling 1975 World Series.  I particularly enjoyed the account of the sixth game - considered by many as the most thrilling series game ever played - where Carlton Fisk \\"waved\\" fair his game-winning homer in the 12th inning to square the series.  Unfortunately, the author misfires on some facts - Dwight Evans' game-saving catch was by the stands (not the bullpen), Oakland was going for its fourth AL flag (not fifth), etc.  The author also omits events like Bill Veeck's re-purchase of the White Sox (keeping the team in Chicago) and St. Louis pitcher Bob Gibson's final season.  Also, there is little mention of how the arrival of free agency helped spur attendance increases from 15,000 per game in 1975 to over 30,000 per game by the early 1990's.       <br /> <br />This book has some flaws, but remains an informative and engaging look at baseball in the last year before free agency.    <br />	2005-02-19

Roosevelt (FDR) of New York for President.  Today Mr. Roosevelt (1882-1945) is widely recognized as a great leader, elected four times despite having polio, the man who launched the New Deal programs that changed America and who led the USA through most of World War II.  But here we see that the front-running Roosevelt was on shaky ice at the 1932 convention because candidates then needed a 2/3rds vote for the nomination.  FDR faced powerful opposition from former nominee Al Smith, house speaker John Nance Garner, Governor Albert Ritchie, Newton Baker, and other powerful figures.  Of course, Roosevelt had strong allies, including Louisiana's notorious Huey Long, plus key advisors Louis Howe and James Farley.  The author describes the strengths and weaknesses of the major players, setting the stage for the drama that unfolded.  Readers also see how FDR's lieutenants offered Garner the Vice Presidency in a near-desperation move after the third ballot that worked and kept Roosevelt's coalition from unraveling.  All this occurred at a convention where Democrats knew they were likely winners against President Hoover in November due to the onset of the Great Depression.   <br /> <br />Author Steve Neal is political correspondent for the Chicago Sun-Times, and he's written a superb narrative.  Some may question whether FDR's coalition at the 1932 convention was as tenuous as Neal suggests, but few will fail to be engaged by this remarkable story.  <br />	2005-02-19

Yuri Zhivago is a doctor in Russia during the tumultuous times of the Russian Revolution and civil war.  Zhivago is both a skilled MD and a compassionate man, both of which are in short supply in war-ravaged Russia.  Events separate Zhivago from his wife and children, and at times from his mistress Lara.  Like so many others, Zhivago's life is largely controlled by fate and larger events, yet he retains his humanity and love of life.  Probably the book's strongest part concerns the love affair played out in an abandoned home during winter - with the civil war never far away.  English-speaking readers may need a few pages to warm up to the author's style (including dual names for the characters), but this powerful book is well worth reading.  <br /> <br />Author Boris Pasternak (1890-1960) was named 1958 Nobel Prize winner for this stunning effort - an award the Soviet Government ordered him not to accept due to Pasternak's critical look at the Bolshevik Revolution.  This is not an easy read at first, but it is an enduring and powerful one.      <br /> <br />	2005-02-19

Ex-cop Rule never suspected that her charming and intelligent co-worker at the Seattle crisis phone center in the early 1970's was a warped rapist-killer.  But then Ted Bundy had most people fooled, including the state's Governor (Dan Evans) for whom he briefly worked.  Still, as the decaying bodies piled up, suspicions grew.    This narrative covers the many crimes by this monster (in four states), the convincing mask he displayed, the efforts of law enforcement, and his escapes from custody that led to further tragedy. We also get a lengthy look at his trial in Florida - where this former law student assisted in his own defense - and his weaseling attempts to trade confessions for time as the hangman approached.  Rule describes her own role in this brutal narrative, and (as always) lets us know something about the tragic victims; a deed one hopes gives some measure of comfort to grieving loved ones.  <br /> <br />THE STRANGER BESIDE ME is a personal and absorbing narrative about a gruesome serial killer and the author's unwitting friendship with him.  This book ranks with the best of Rule's many superb efforts.   <br />	2005-01-31

Navy \\"lifers\\" Billy Budduskey and Mule Mulhall are career non-coms ordered to transport a young recruit from the base in Virginia up to the naval prison in New England.  Budduskey and Mulhall personify gruffness and machismo, but they quickly sympathize with their prisoner.  He's a naive and friendless recruit given a ridiculous eight-year sentence for stealing a few dollars from the Commander's kitty.  Budduskey and Mullhall decide to take their time and show the prisoner some fun in transit.  That fun is largely beer, tough talk, and cheap motels, but it lets the three sailors thumb their nose at injustice.  In turn, the recruit views his captors as father figures and friends (the only he may have for years).  Eventually, the depressing delivery must occur, and that leads to futher rebellion.            <br /> <br />THE LAST DETAIL is a gruff, humorous, entertaining novel, one published during anti-Vietnam, anti-establishment protests in 1970.  This book was later made into a surprisingly good (if overlooked) movie starring Jack Nicholson, Otis Young, and Randy Quaid.   <br />	2005-01-22
US	49935455	R119QO7E45RY7I	0684803356	896923	For Whom the Bell Tolls	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Powerful Statement	Author Ernest Hemingway spared little in this searing look at the Spanish Civil War.  Readers see that hatred, loyalty, doubt, atrocity, ideals, and emotional wear were all part of this tragic conflict.  The story centers on American volunteer Robert Jordan and his anti-fascist comrades, a band of Spanish Loyalist guerillas operating in the hills behind enemy lines in 1937.  Jordan is planning to blow up a Fascist-held bridge as part of an upcoming Loyalist/Republican offensive.  His comrades include Pablo, a once-dependable leader now unstable and sick of war, Pilar, a woman of remarkable fiber, and Maria, a victim of fascist atrocities with whom Jordan falls in love.  These guerillas hide in the hills while Hitler's bombers fly overhead helping the fascists.  Readers learn of atrocities committed by both sides, and see that ideals can die along with those that fall in battle.   <br /> <br />This 1940 novel makes a powerful statement, despite losing some effect from Hemingway's wordiness and too-lengthy descriptions.  Despite this flaw, readers see the cruelties of war, and sense the author's heartsickness at this dreadful conflict.         <br />	2005-01-22

Fred Dobbs is a U.S. drifter scraping by on odd jobs down in Mexico during the 1920's. Dobbs meets another drifter named Curtin, and the two become enticed by tales of gold from an aging prospector (Howard) they encounter in a flop house. The three Americans soon head for the hills, at which point the story's protagonist switches from Dobbs to this gold-seeking trio.  The men find gold on a mountain in the Sierra Madres, along with brutal heat, ceaseless labor, and unwanted threats from bandits and outsiders. As their find increases, Dobbs begins to show signs of &#34;gold fever,&#34; a deadly suspicion that Howard has warned about.  Additionally, getting their loot safely to the city to cash in may prove another worrisome challenge. Readers feel like we're right alongside the three as they dig for gold, make survival decisions, and grow suspicious of one another.  We see the darker side of human nature, and learn about Mexico and its remarkable people.  Author B. Traven (1890?-1969) was a private man of leftist/anarchist views who lived in Mexico after apparently being born in Chicago and raised in Germany.  Traven comprehended human nature, felt compassion for the poor, and took a couple swipes at capitalism, politicians, and the church.  If you liked the classic 1948 film (starring Humphrey Bogart), you should find this superbly readable book even better.	2005-01-12

Armed with a free tape recorder, teenagers Lealan Jones and Lloyd Newman went on assignment for National Public Radio at age 13 in 1993 and again in 1996.  Jones and Newman interviewed relatives, neighbors, friends and each other about life in the notorious Ida B. Wells public housing.  Readers sense the tragedy and hopelessness of life in the projects, as well as the hope and sense of community that also exists.  Jones and Newman also report on the aftermath of the tragic killing of Eric Morse, a 5-year old who was thrown from a 14th floor window (for refusing to steal) in a crime that made national headlines.  Many will prefer these firsthand accounts to the drier writings of sociologists and other outside \\"experts.\\"  The editors appear to have altered the black street language into a somewhat more \\"standard\\" English, but the words retain their power.  Jones and Newman did an outstanding job, and prove once again that impressive people often come from humble backgrounds.   <BR>         <BR>OUR AMERICA has been made into an HBO movie, Newman apparently survived a dangerous beating (unrelated to this book), and Jones has even taught this book to high school students - he even lists his email address in a review in these web pages.

Highlights include Winston Churchill's surprise wartime appearance in newly-liberated Paris, and Shirer's chance meeting with a Russian soldier who'd read the author's translated diary in the trenches near Stalingrad.  A low point was the griping and lack of remorse on the part of the beaten Germans.  The author includes many (perhaps too many) captured Nazi documents relating to the war and Nazi atrocities - documents that Shirer later used in his superb RISE AND FALL OF THE THIRD REICH published in 1960.  This book doesn't have the bite and tension of it's predecessor - Shirer only wrote this later edition because CBS fired him and he needed money - but it's a highly readable companion.	2004-07-17

Readers learn about seldom-reported areas as relations between players and umpires, how officials take command on the field, the coolie wages paid to minor-league umpires (and many players), and the loneliness that umpires experience from being on the road for months at a time.  Mr. Pallone also tries to settle scores with the baseball establishment for having fired him, and with certain pro-union umpires that harassed him for having crossed the picket line during the bitter 1979 umpire's strike.  But this book is also about Pallone's sexual identity, which he hid lest he get fired for being gay - as allegedly happened prior to the 1989 season.  Many readers will sympathize with Pallone's insecurities and love for baseball, but might choose to fast forward through the brief descriptions of his romantic life.    <br />Pallone is straightforward about baseball, umpiring, plus his emotions both on and off the field.  This is an intelligent and hard-hitting biography.	2004-07-17

In this look at the sexual side of baseball, Pepitone examines not so much his successes as his failures; as a husband, father, and a could-have-been superstar.  Pepitone attributes a portion of his flaws to his troubled upbringing and near addiction to sex, but also accepts responsibility.  Young Pepitone seemed to have it all; charm, charisma, superb baseball talent, and Italian-American heritage playing in his hometown (New York) with many thousands of Italian-American fans.  Yet he was immature and insecure, eager to flee his problems, and probably clinically depressed - at a time when issues like depression were rarely discussed.  One wonders how many other athletes and celebrities face similar ordeals and keep them hidden.  This is a pretty good baseball book, one where the subject both celebrates his triumphs and confesses his failures.	2004-07-17

It's the story of Bigger Thomas, a self-loathing young black man that accidentally kills a white coed, and then kills again in an effort to evade detection.  Bigger is hardly sympathetic, but his tragic hand is forced in part by racism.  It's as if the author is saying, \\"Your injustices helped create Bigger Thomas!\\"  Wright's gripping (if contrived) treatment of Bigger's trial indicts such peripheral characters as Mr. Dalton, a supposedly decent man that funds Negro charities - but only after fleecing blacks in the rental market.  Readers come away understanding the cruelties of racial injustice, and comprehending why Wright might have named his character Bigger.   Some say this classic was loosely based on a 1938 killing on the city's South Side. <br />NATIVE SON is rather wordy in its last chapters, and many dislike the author's pro-communism - naïve sentiments Wright later dropped after learning more about Stalinist Russia.  Despite these minor flaws, this classic is gripping, persuasive, and probably Wright's best work.	2004-07-17

Author Meyer Levin (1905-1981) was a former classmate of the two killers, and he wrote this readable account some three decades after the crime occurred.  Renaming the killers \\"Judd\\" and \\"Artie,\\" the author shows how these brilliant young collegians murdered a 14-year neighbor for thrills, and to validate their warped sense of superiority as inspired by philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche.  Readers learn of the killers' pseudo-homosexual relationship, and get a detailed look at the OJ Simpson-like media trial in which famed attorney Clarence Darrow (\\"Jonathan Wilk\\") fought to save his arrogant clients from the gallows. Readers also get a strong look at abnormal psychology, plus a plausible added motive for the crime.    <br />Many suspect the author's too-sympathetic treatment of Leopold (\\"Judd\\") aided the latter's questionable 1958 parole - still, the paroled murderer sued the author over this book (but didn't win).

In 1924 Chicago, millionaire collegians Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb murdered 14-year old Bobby Franks for thrills and to bolster their warped claims of superiority as inspired by philosopher Frederick Nietzsche.  Readers learn all about the crime, it's planning, and how it was solved largely because of eyeglasses unknowingly left behind.  Higdon also details the lengthy media trial (ala OJ Simpson) where famed attorney Clarence Darrow fought to keep his arrogant young clients from the gallows.  We also get a detailed history of the crime's aftermath, including Leopold's questionable 1958 parole, and additional events extending into the 1970's.        <br />Higdon has given us a superbly readable account, one that settles certain misconceptions arising from COMPULSION, an excellent fictional account by Meyer Levin.

Narrator and former FBI Agent Joseph Pistone describes going undercover as jewel thief \\"Donnie Brasco\\" in 1976.  \\"Brasco\\" soon infiltrated the syndicate, and ended up spending five years as a connected member of New York's Bonnano crime family.  Brasco assisted in dozens of minor crimes (theft, handling stolen merchandise) to maintain his bad-guy credibility, all the while acting surreptitiously to prevent major crimes from occurring.  Readers see how his mafia crew engaged in crimes ranging from theft and burglary, to truck hijackings, robbery, witness intimidation and murder.  Brasco also details his emotions, which included fear, loneliness, even guilt over having to deceive mob partners like Lefty \\"Guns\\" Ruggerio and \\"Sonny Black\\" (who was later murdered).  Imagine working undercover knowing that some crook you'd arrested years ago in another state might suddenly appear and recognize you - in which case your mafia \\"friends\\" will kill you within minutes.  Imagine having to keep your wife and daughters in the dark about your work, knowing that you'll all need to be relocated with new identities once the operation ends. <BR>      <BR> \\"Operation Don Brasco,\\" led to scores of arrests and convictions, not to mention a $500,000 contract being placed on Pistone's head.

Ms. Fahey was attractive, talented, kind-hearted...yet troubled by emotional problems.  Sadly, she never recognized the danger from her married ex-lover Tom Capano - an egotistical control freak and well-connected attorney for whom a legal restraining order might (or might not) have proved a deterrent.  Author Ann Rule gives us a firm portrayal of the victim, her killer, their families, plus the politics of the city of Wilmington and the State of Delaware (where Fahey was the Governor's secretary).  Ms. Rule also details the outstanding investigation by law enforcement, plus the lengthy trial, where even the killer's lawyers came to despise his controlling egotism.  Some feel the author portrays Fahey and a second mistress too nicely - after all, both women maintained an affair with a man whom they knew to be married.  Still, emotional insecurity has led many to foolhardy actions; in Fahey's case with results that turned tragic.          <BR>        <BR>AND NEVER LET HER GO is longer and more connecting than most of Ms. Rule's true-crime narratives.

Author Raymond Schroth details Sevareid's upbringing in rural North Dakota and Minneapolis, his hiring by Ed Murrow, his long career with CBS, and his less than perfect retirement.  Readers also learn about Sevareid's adventurous youth, troubled marriages, and bouts with melancholy and emotional insecurity.  The book makes a nice companion to Sevareid's superb 1946 autobiography NOT SO WILD A DREAM, but also covers the man's later years.  Sevareid moved millions with his sternly eloquent wisdom as he analyzed events for CBS radio and (later) television.  The nation lost an important voice when CBS forced him out at age 65 - under a mandatory retirement policy they've since dropped.  Sadly, he never wrote much in retirement, nor become a regular contributor to National Public Radio as have aged ex-CBS stalwarts Daniel Schorr, Richard B. Hotellet, and the late Bob Trout.  The author is a Jesuit instructor of journalism and former boyhood fan of Sevareid's broadcasts.  Like THE MURROW BOYS, this is a nice, readable companion to Sevareid's superb autobiography.	2003-07-04

Author Studs Terkel interviews several dozen U.S. veterans, many of whom were still mourning lost comrades decades later.  Among the memorable interviews, we hear from a veteran that married his dead comrade's widow, a future realtor wounded in a racist massacre at a U.S. army base, and STARS AND STRIPES cartoonist Bill Mauldin.  Terkel also speaks with a dying Chicago taxi driver who later was buried as requested along the Elbe River in Germany where his unit first linked up with the Russians in 1945.  Several interviewees saw no combat, including civilians that describe life on the home front.  I'd heard war tales from my father (Air Corps) and uncle (Army), and most of the stories in this book ring true.  Many interviewees seem to agree with the author that this \\"Good\\" war was a nauseating but necessary struggle against Hitler and fascism.  As with Terkel's other books, the interviewees are largely from Chicago, and, on balance, they tend to reinforce his liberal views.                <BR>               <BR>Some say Terkel isn't an author, but merely a good listener with a handy tape recorder.

Historian Stephen Ambrose (1936-2002) focuses on pilot and future Presidential candidate George McGovern and his comrades from the 15th Army Air Force stationed in Italy from 1944-45.  These men trained, worked, and sometimes died while performing hazardous duty under incredible stress.  We sense the utter fear they felt from anti-aircraft fire (flak), German fighters, and accidents.  We read of their reaction to homesickness, lost comrades, bombs that fell lethally off target, and tent life in the Italian countryside. McGovern's crewmembers salute him as highly skilled, courageous, and steadfast under fire - ironic given later attacks on his patriotism for his anti-Vietnam political views.  My father was a B-24 navigator in the marginally less dangerous Pacific theatre, and his tales mirror many that appear in this book.  Readers may note that this book is more memoir than general history, and it barely mentions the larger 8th Army Air Force stationed in England.     <BR> <BR>Some say this volume lacks the polish found in Ambrose' best efforts.  Also, the author was accused of plagiarizing certain sections of this book - a charge some believe, but others attribute to jealous colleagues tired of seeing the readable Ambrose on the best-seller list while their academic treatises collect dust.  Whichever is the case, WILD BLUE makes pretty good reading.	2003-07-04

Did Army doctor Jeff MacDonald murder his wife and daughters (as much evidence suggests), or was he beaten unconscious by late-night intruders who committed this brutal crime?  When the case finally went to trial after nine years of legal wrangling, Dr. MacDonald hired author Joe McGinnis to cover what doctor hoped would be his acquittal - but the jury (and separately, McGinnis) concluded that he was guilty.  McGinnis then wrote this page-turning account of the crime, investigations, six-week trial, legal maneuvers, plus additional facts the jury never saw.  The author concludes with a shaky psychological conviction based on MacDonald's arrogant, self-absorbed personality.  Seemingly more persuasive is evidence suggesting MacDonald abused a dangerous amphetamine for weeks leading up to the crime.  Whatever your take, this compelling true-crime drama leaves many convinced of MacDonald's guilt, but others harboring enough doubt to stimulate debate.  MacDonald's supporters attack this book as inaccurate and unfair.  They point to investigative errors, [substance abuser] Helena Stoeckley, and disturbing claims of suppressed evidence from a book of similar title (FATAL JUSTICE) that requests a new trial.  But MacDonald secretly flunked two polygraphs in 1970 - after refusing an army polygraph to clear his name - and the absence of blood, splinters, and pajama fibers in the suspiciously tidy living room appear to refute MacDonald's claim that he battled several intruders in there.  FATAL VISION doesn't prove MacDonald guilty, but it's a compelling read.	2003-04-05

We hear from dozens of outstanding senior citizens, each one giving their personal remembrance of American life in the 20th Century.   The mostly liberal interviewees range from ordinary citizens to baseball activist Marvin Miller, Congressmen Henry Gonzalez and (the late) Charles Hayes, and Chicago medical director Quentin Young.   Readers get a strong personal sense of major events like the Depression, World War II, McCarthyism and Civil Rights - something one seldom gets from dry academic texts.  The book also lends credence to tales many of us once heard from older and often now-departed relatives. <br />I gave COMING OF AGE just four starts because Terkel's increasing rigidity in sticking with liberal interviewees deprives readers of an honest cross-section of views.  Despite this flaw, COMING OF AGE remains a moving effort.	2002-04-16

Fans may recall such highlights as the June series against Oakland (providing the team's first sellout in six years), the 4-0 win over the Yankees despite being no-hit, and the 2-1 finale against Seattle.  Bukowski writes with poise and emotion, fencing metaphorically with arrogant Sox owner Jerry \\"The Chairman\\" Reinsdorf.  But the author's attachment keeps him from recognizing why the old ballpark had to go; the bad seats and poor location hurt attendance, cut profits, and made the White Sox chronic underdogs to the media-adored Cubs in popular Wrigley Field.  Ironically, Reinsdorf and his cronies ended up building another mediocre ballpark across the street, leaving the Sox franchise (and fans) cursed by greedy, blundering owners.  <BR>            <BR>Bukowski once led a group hoping to save the old ballpark, and his readable prose easily outweighs one or two minor factual errors.  This is a fun, informative look at Chicago baseball.	2002-03-16

The interviews are often interesting, revealing, and at times jaded by misconceptions or fear.  We hear from people of genuine goodwill, but there are also unfair denials of white privilege, nonsense about how only whites can be racist, and a seeming reluctance by some interviewees to open up completely.  Sadly, we get little perspective from Asians, Latinos, recent immigrants, or Native American Indians. Nor does the author interview many of those multitudes of suburbanites who fled city neighborhoods because racial change brought marked increases in violence and blight.<BR>                 <BR>RACE falls well short of Terkel's best efforts like WORKING and HARD TIMES.  The book lacks a certain bite, in part because people are hesitant to honestly discuss racial issues, but also because Terkel stacks the interviews to promote his politically correct views while avoiding certain troubling issues.  RACE should have been a more engaging, more popular book.	2002-02-10

We hear from dozens of surviving veterans, most of whose lives were ruled by terror, confusion, cold, and dumb luck.  We also read about trapped civilians, frigid battle conditions, and the opposing commanders.  Id have liked better maps from this 1959 edition, but the few provided were useful.  Toland shows how the U.S. army was caught off guard, and then rallied under adverse conditions.  He confirms that Eisenhower, Bradley, and the GIs they led were skilled; sadly, so were their Nazi-inspired opponents.  One thing Toland never really explains is why the Allies were so short of reserves during the battle - perhaps too many of Americas 12 million servicemen in December, 1944 were stationed elsewhere.  <BR>               <BR>Toland is a non-academic historian whose gripping style far outsells the stuffy outputs of many academics (with exceptions like Stephen Ambrose). This is a chilling account of a horrific battle.	2001-12-12

Author Elliot Asinof shows how the White Sox players (rather, infielder Chick Gandil) first approached the gamblers, and how the fixed World Series proceeded amidst threats, misunderstandings and double-crosses.  We also read about the player's 1921 trial for conspiracy, noting that the gamblers escaped unscathed.  I liked the author's portraits of conspiring players Eddie Ciccotte and Shoeless Joe Jackson (who's guilt seems modified), the unfairly banished Buck Weaver, and innocent teammates like Ray Schalk and Eddie Collins.  Asinof correctly co-indicts baseball's reserve clause and Sox owner Charles Comiskey.  The cold-hearted Comiskey precipitated the scandal by grossly underpaying his talented athletes in that already low-wage era.  One senses parallels to modern college point-shaving scandals; bitter athletes fixing scores to grab a slice of the pie unfairly denied them.   <BR> <BR>Since this book first appeared in 1963, free agency boosted player salaries, the missing grand jury confessions surfaced (in offices of Comiskey's late attorney), and this book's movie plus FIELD OF DREAMS brought the scandal to recent light.  One thing hasn't changed; the underdog White Sox still have been in just one one World Series (which they lost)in all the years since 1919.	2001-11-03

This book is one in a six-part series examining the life of our third President.  I read this book for a college class and immediately grasped the unending pressures that President Jefferson faced in his second term.  Malone examines the decision-making options available to Jefferson, usually (and perhaps too often) supporting the eventual route that the President decided upon.  This volume's research and analysis is worthy of five stars, not to mention the 1975 Pulitzer Prize the series captured.  Unfortunately, Malone's stilted prose - the weakness of most academic historians - produces a rather laborious read.  Thus, four stars overall.	2001-11-03

In 1959, author John Howard Griffin (1920-80) used special medication to darken his skin, and then traveled the Deep South as a black man in the latter days of legal segregation.  The \\"Negro\\" Griffin encountered separate facilities, hate-filled stares, assumptions that he was over-sexed, and job options limited to menial labor.  He found conditions slightly better in big cities like New Orleans and Atlanta, but never free of rudeness or indignities.  Griffin also met a small number of whites that apologized for racism.  When Griffin switched his skin color back to white, blacks became surly, and whites became friendly.  Unfortunately, Griffin never ventured outside the Deep South, depriving us of a chance to compare racism between regions.  In this sense, his stirring book is too short.<BR>    <BR>BLACK LIKE ME angered white southerners when published in 1960.  Griffin (who'd once recovered from blindness) received anonymous death threats, and soon developed health problems associated with his special medication.  Too bad we cannot step into each other's race the way Griffin did - it might make for a better society.	2001-11-03

Perhaps his most valuable insights concern the personalities and egos of various politicians - few journalists realize, as does Germond how important such characteristics are in politics and governing.  I particularly liked his insights on Nixon, Carter, the first (and clearly elected) Bush, and Clinton, not to mention such would-be leaders as Rockefeller and Averill Harriman.  Germond dislikes pretensions, nor does he kowtow to the high and mighty.  Some readers may occasionally disagree with his views, but all should respect this man's intelligence and sense of fair play.  Germond also discusses his Louisiana upbringing, race relations, horse playing, the insides of newsrooms, and his daughter's tragic illness.  <BR>    <BR>Germond gained fame from television, but he's far more captivating on radio.  His book contains much similar charm, with readable prose, excellent insights, and unfortunately, too few pages.	2001-09-28

Seldes began as a cub reporter for the Pittsburgh Leader in 1909, but was soon overseas covering World War One, and then Weimar Germany, Bolshevik Russia, Fascist Italy, and the Spanish Civil War.  I liked the author's analysis, not to mention his portraits of such figures as Generals Pershing and Hindenburg, Mussolini, Lenin, Trotsky, etc.  Seldes scorns the era's conservative publishers for failing to cover many important issues, a problem he combated with his newsletter IN FACT from 1940-50.  Sadly, today's corporate media barons also avoid certain issues.  I gave the book four stars because the last chapters tend to fade - Seldes wrote them while in his mid-90's.  Still, WITNESS TO A CENTURY provides an excellent look at many events that helped shape today's world.<br />George Seldes (1890-1995) was an outstanding journalist, one who respected truth until the day he passed at age 104.  As his obituary noted, nearly until the end he was still discussing world events with admirers who phoned or visited his home in rural Vermont.	2001-09-27

Author Jules Tygiel also informs about such secondary figures as Larry Doby, Bill Veeck, Hank Aaron, Pumpsie Green, etc. Tygiel shows that integration proceeded slowly and in the face of strong resistance - the Boston Red Sox didn't add a black player until 1959, three years after Jackie Robinson retired. We also see how baseball integration spurred civil rights, while hastening the end of the Negro Leagues. I'd have liked more coverage of baseball's declining attendance after 1949 (probably caused by television), and the suspected correlation between athletic dominance and underclass poverty. Still, BASEBALL'S GREAT EXPERIMENT is a well-researched look at an interesting period in sports history.	2001-09-01

A majority of the interviewees are Chicagoans, who on balance tend to reinforce the author's liberal views.  We hear from former jobless, hoboes, people who had work, the rich, even a gangster.  We read varied opinions on President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal, which eased (but didn't end) the hard times before later evolving into the welfare state.  Imagine times so difficult that thousands hopped freight trains and traveled long distances in an often-fruitless search for a job - any job.  Some interviewees worked for the WPA, a New Deal program that put millions of unemployed men (including my grandfather) to work repairing sidewalks and building structures like post offices and Chicago's Lake Shore Drive.  HARD TIMES helps readers understand why so many of our grandparents kept talking about the Depression long after it had ended.<br /><br />Some say that Studs Terkel isn't an author, but merely a good listener with a tape recorder.  Either way, the result is a series of very readable oral histories such as HARD TIMES, THE GOOD WAR, DIVISION STREET, WORKING, etc.	2001-09-01

Dr. William Maples (1937-97) was a forensic anthropologist who examined bone and tissue samples to determine a person's age, gender, if they'd given birth, cause of death, etc.  Imagine testifying at a murder trial while the killer stares at you.  Dr. Maples did, knowing that if the jury acquitted the killer might seek revenge.  When historians questioned whether angry slaveholders had secretly poisoned President Zachary Taylor in 1850, they called in Dr. Maples for the answer.  Maples also investigated the bones of Russia's murdered Czar Nicholas II and family, in part to determine if their Bolshevik executioners might have spared young Anastasia and Alexei. This book has many such authentic tales.<br />Maples and co-author Michael Browning wrote personable, easy prose that never loses the reader in jargon.   DEAD MEN DO TELL TALES is an excellent read for the non-squeamish.	2001-08-21

Back in Columbus, Ohio to visit his dying father, Greene met 84-year old Paul Tibbets, the pilot that dropped the bomb.  In getting to know Tibbets, Greene came to better understand his late father.  Tibbets and the elder Greene (1915-98) never met, but they shared many values, including a sense of duty and horror from World War II.  Like many, Tibbets believes the bomb shortened the war and spared lives, sending home safely many future dads like the elder Greene (and my own father).  I wish the author had pressed Tibbets on alternatives such as demonstrating the bomb non-lethally, but DUTY isn't really about politics.  It's more about the author's father, Tibbets, the war, and the ties binding and divisions separating baby boomers and their war-generation parents.  I particularly liked reading the elder Greene's life memories, which he spoke into a tape recorder before passing. <br />DUTY is a readable, moving tribute to two men and their dwindling generation.	2001-08-15

In this eloquent 1946 memoir, Sevareid (1912-92) describes coming of age in North Dakota and Minneapolis, plus his early years in journalism.  Sevareid canoed uncharted waters at 17, rode the rails, and was an activist at the University of Minnesota during the Great Depression. After a couple years in newspapers, he joined Ed Murrow at CBS Radio on the eve of World War II, covering the 1940 French collapse, and later parachuting from a falling U.S. warplane into the Asian jungle.  This gifted if insecure journalist makes the Depression and war against Fascism seem like the very real struggles they were, rather than as mere facts from some textbook.  He also sheds his early idealism for a more practical view of a changing world. The author called Murrow &#34;the man who made me,&#34; but Sevareid was a born newsman.   Sevareid's dedication and high standards (a rarity in today's news) led another columnist to describe him as &#34;North Dakota's gift to journalism.&#34;  Readers may also enjoy the memoirs of his CBS colleagues like William L. Shirer, Walter Cronkite and Howard K. Smith.  NOT SO WILD A DREAM is dated, but remains an excellent narrative about a man, America, and quality journalism.	2001-05-20

We meet Joseph K, an average citizen who is informed that he has been charged with a crime.  Joseph K retains a lawyer and reports to the court as ordered. Despite his compliance, he cannot find what crime he is charged with, and the noose around him seems to tighten with every passing day.  Kafka wrote this book in 1914, a few years before a fellow Austrian began leading the Nazi Party in Germany.  It was as if Kafka was predicting the future.  THE TRIAL has a powerful message, but it can leave the reader annoyed.	2001-04-15

Author Nicholas Pileggi focuses on four major characters.  The most prominent was ex-sports handicapper and bookie Frank \\"Lefty\\" Rosenthal, who became an innovative casino manager.  Lefty ran the casino at the Stardust Hotel, the location from where the Chicago and Kansas City  syndicates skimmed millions in gambling revenues.  We also read about Lefty's friend and mob enforcer Tony Spilotro, front man Allen Glick, and Lefty's glamorous but volatile wife Geri.  The author describes casino operations, financing by teamster pensions, and gambling executives who knew enough to look the other way.  We also see how unchecked greed and ego can destroy casino operators as surely as it does some of their customers.  The book's only weakness was that Pileggi seemed to go easy on a couple of the major characters.  <br />\\"Casino\\" became a 1995 movie of the same name.  Pileggi also wrote \\"Wiseguy,\\" basis for another excellent mob film (\\"Goodfellas\\") by Martin Scorsese.  \\"Casino\\" doesn't quite match \\"Wiseguy,\\" but it's a highly readable and informative book.	2001-01-31

The author exposes ballplayers as fallibly human rather than as the falsely promoted role models, and discusses such once concealed issues as salary fights, pep pills and groupies.  Bouton also confesses his own insecurities as a washed up pitcher hanging on via the knuckleball.  This book dates from the era before free agency, when established players had to fight to get paid incredibly modest salaries.  \\"Ball Four\\" also reminds us that long hair, civil rights, and Vietnam were controversial in 1969.  Unfortunately, Bouton's &quot;kiss-n-tell&quot; insensitivity towards certain teammates (some of whom disliked him) detracts a bit from his writing.  <br />    This book annoyed the baseball establishment when published in 1970.  Bouton (and editor Leonard Schecter) exceeded \\"The Long Season,\\" a mildly irreverent 1959 diary by pitcher Jim Brosnan that also upset the baseball lords.  \\"Ball Four: The Final Pitch,\\" contains successive ten-year updates that each add a nice perspective.

Jocks weren't supposed to write books, but this college-educated ballplayer (uncommon in the 1950's) wrote a very good one.  Brosnan's mild irreverence annoyed the game's overseers in an era when ballplayers earned modest paychecks and rarely popped off.  Older fans may enjoy reading about long-forgotten ballplayers playing in now-demolished ballparks like Forbes Field and Sportsmen's Park.  Brosnan followed this book with &quot;Pennant Race,&quot; a diary from the 1961 season.  Some alledge that the Chicago White Sox tried to insert a clause in Brosnan's  contract banning him from publishing anything, while others say he was blackballed from the game after 1963 for his writings.

Pilgrim then returns to American success as a suburban optometrist.  Pilgrim secretly rebels against the hollow values of suburbia, time traveling between various stages of his life, and eventually submitting to capture by UFO's.  I liked the author's attacks on cruelty, praise for kindness amidst chaos, and his repetition of expressions (\\"poor old Edgar Derby,\\"  \\"So it goes\\") to make powerful statements.  Some suspect that Vonnegut's pen was guided by post-traumatic stress dating from his wartime experiences.  \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is technically science fiction, but it's a winner in any genre.	2001-01-29

Of course, it helped if Shirer's U.S. audience was listening between the lines, like when the author reported seeing groups of Jews working on road gangs in newly conquered Poland.  These scripts cannot reproduce how Shirer (1904-93) used his flat Midwest inflection to get certain points past the Nazi censors standing near his microphone.  Perhaps one can still ask older Americans who remember these broadcasts.  Readers may want a copy of the author's \\"Berlin Diary\\" and even his \\"Nightmare Years\\" for illumination, and Shirer fans can hope that his family publishes more of his writings.  The censorship detracts a bit from the author's immense talents, but he still comes through loud and clear.	2001-01-29

Ex-mobster Henry Hill describes his 25-year career as a hijacker, arsonist, and thief.  Hill and his associates operated via a combination of bribes, intimidation, crooked cops, and greedy businessmen eager for stolen merchandise (swag).  Lest readers be misinformed, Hill's associates (if not Hill) murdered not just renegade mobsters, but ordinary citizens who got in the way.  This book both glamorizes and attacks the swaggering, fast-money Mafia lifestyle.  Hill entered FBI witness protection in 1980 after his bust for narcotics distribution left him a marked man for having violated syndicate rules against drug trafficking.  Director Martin Scorsese turned this book into the superb 1990 movie \\"Goodfellows.\\"  Pileggi followed with \\"Casino,\\" another fine narrative (and Scorsese movie) that investigates Midwest mob influence in Las Vegas.  \\"Wiseguy\\" is a very absorbing and informative read.	2001-01-29

We hear from former adventure seekers, runaways, hobos, migrants and hustlers.  Before TV, jet travel, and interstate highways, people saw the country from passenger trains or by hopping aboard boxcars.  This book describes wanderlust, hunger, loneliness, criminals, railroad police, genuine acts of charity, plus frightful hazards from weather and accidents.  The book reminds us that during the Great Depression, laid-off workers (such as my grandfather) hopped freight trains and traveled long distances to find a job - any job.  The 1934 movie \\"It Happened One Night\\" even shows Clark Gable waving solemnly to forlorn men atop a passing freight train.  Look at the photograph of the smiling young diner at the CCC work camp and you'll see why Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected President four times.<br /><br />In the early 1990's the author placed ads in major publications hoping to locate a few dozen surviving wanderers from the 1930's.  To his surprise he received nearly 3,000 replies, and eventually conducted 500 interviews. The book succeeds primarily because the subjects tell their moving tales with clear memories over half a century later.  \\"Riding the Rails\\" is readable, personal history.	2001-01-29

Tuchman begins by examining the pre-war politics, military plans, and inept diplomacy of major European nations.  Once hostilities begin, she focuses heavily on Germany's attack through Belgium and Northern France - an offensive that just missed defeating France outright in 1914 and altering the course of history.  The author exposes military stupidity, German atrocities in Belgium, and shows how this conflict opened as a murderous war of movement rather than as the entrenched stalemate that followed.  I'd have liked fuller coverage on competing theaters of war, and wish that Tuchman hadn't stopped at the Battle of the Marne.  Still, this is compelling history.  Most importantly, the author shows how new technology and bungling politicians that failed to control their eager militarists plunged Europe into needless disaster.  No wonder President Kennedy referred to this book during the Cuban missile crisis. <br />    Tuchman was one of a few readable non-historians (William L. Shirer, John Toland) who outdid the stuffy academics.  I particularly liked her coverage on Belgium's dilemma: either let the Germans march through, or fight them against overwhelming odds - you have 12 hours to decide.  \\"The Guns of August\\" is gripping, tragic history at its finest.	2001-01-22

The setting is adjacent but mutually suspicious communities in southwestern Michigan.  St. Joseph (population 9,300) is mostly white and middle class, while across the narrow river Benton Harbor (13,000) is largely black, poor, and crime-ridden.  McGinnis, a black teen from Benton Harbor, vanished one evening in 1991 after fleeing from a man in downtown St. Joseph whose car he'd allegedly broken into.  Days later McGinnis turned up in the river.  Perhaps he was beaten, but this fleet young man could easily outrace his hefty pursuer.  As the author investigates what happened, he finds opinions hardened by race and community bias rather than by the facts (shades of O.J. Simpson).  Kotlowitz also finds allegations of police misconduct and biased housing patterns, plus smug indifference by some whites, and certain blacks that cry racism at every turn.  <br />      Kotlowitz writes about tragedy and race without casting blame or seeking favor.  For that reason alone one should read his outstanding narrative.  Sadly, the author never discovers how McGinnis died, or the key to healing our racial divide.	2001-01-22

We hear a stockbroker, trucker, priest, hooker, teller, cops, teachers, autoworkers, and many others discuss their livelihoods.  Readers come away appreciating the unique challenges of each job, and the powerlessness that afflicts many employees.  These interviews occurred primarily in Chicago during the early 1970's, when the workplace featured fewer women and more jobs in heavy industry.  We meet Mike, a steelworker annoyed by his lack of skills who senses that his union job may vanish - as probably occurred a few years later when US Steel and the surrounding mills closed their plants in South Chicago.  Barbara is a young advertising executive forced to deal with a level of office sexism one hopes is now passé.  Ex-railroaders Bill and Louis each lament the shriveling of their once-vital industry from separate perches as retiree and washroom attendant.  &#34;Working&#34; has many similar, compelling tales.  The book may be slightly dated, but it remains a highly informative read.	2001-01-18

The author attacks amateurism as fraudulent and unworkable, and shows that football scandals have recurred almost since the game's founding (by rebellious students) in the late 1800's.  We also learn that athletic programs rarely turn profits or boost fund-raising for their host schools.  Despite these criticisms, this author (and ex-player at Northwestern) remains as attached to the game as us fans.  Telander concludes his concise and highly readable book with a sensible proposal for reform.  &#34;The Hundred Yard Lie&#34; fell on predictably deaf ears when first published in 1989.  Still, it's an eye opener for those of us who both enjoy the sport yet dare to dare question football's relationship to higher education.	2001-01-08
US	49935455	R6YW2Y7L9JQ4S	0385037872	633917650	Roots	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Outstanding	Alex Haley's superb narrative of his family genealogy ranks with the great works of American writing.  Combining fact with historical fiction, Haley (1921-92) begins by describing his ancestor Kunta Kinte from African village life, to the horrors of the slave ship in 1767 and servitude on a Virginia plantation. Few expressions are more powerful than when Kunta Kinte and his wife Bell vanish from the pages after their daughter Kizzie is sold away.  \\"Roots\\" then focuses on Kizzie, Chicken George, and other descendants on up thru freedom and the eventual birth of the author.  The story fades a bit near the end - Haley was behind schedule and dodging bill collectors as he wrote the final chapters.  Still, this is an outstanding and very readable narrative about ordinary (yet remarkable) human beings.  Haley even details tracing his ancestry to Kunta Kinte's native village in present-day Gambia.  \\"Roots\\" became an immensely popular ABC miniseries in 1977, setting thousands of other Americans to tracing their family histories.	2000-12-31

The author recounts his Brooklyn youth, law school, and his career at Harvard University.  He also examines anti-Semitism, separation of church-and-state, assimilation, and other facets pertaining to Jewish and non-Jewish life in America.  Dershowitz emphasizes that American Jews must stop maintaining low profiles or feeling anxious about our success (and non-success), as doing so is the essence of second-class citizenship.   His point is well taken, but perhaps newly arrived immigrants from Russia and other anti-Semitic lands will doubt his premise.  I didn't always agree with the man's pro-Israeli views, but on balance this is a very thoughtful and informative book.	2000-12-30

On the good side, Karabell vividly captures American politics circa 1948, analyzing how matters soon changed with television.  He examines the strengths and weaknesses of Truman, Dewey, and third-party candidates Henry Wallace and Strom Thurmond.  The author also correctly notes how Democratic support for civil rights in 1948 started the South's long slide to the Republicans.  Unfortunately, Karabell is off base in claiming that a &#34;dirty&#34; Truman campaign led the Republicans to future slanders and McCarthyism.  In reality, GOP slanders against Truman (and FDR) were already plentiful - Dewey's 1948 billboards promised to drive communists from government.  Mudslinging by both parties has a long history, and dates back at least to the campaign of 1800 when Federalist John Adams and rival Thomas Jefferson were each accused by of being traitors and British (or French) agents.  Karabell also barely mentions the campaign's most important factor - incumbents rarely lose in times of peace and prosperity.  &#34;The Last Campaign&#34; is is a fun read, but it's analysis is somewhat spotty.	2000-12-14

I liked reading of Ed Murrow's battles with the CBS brass, and the portraits of William L. Shirer, Eric Sevareid, Larry LeSueur, Myra Breckenridge (the Murrow \\"Girl\\"), Charles Collingwood, etc.  How odd that such talented journalists were often wracked by jealousy and self-doubt. How predictable that CBS eventually dumped most of the Boys - along with their high standards - after the advent of television.  By forsaking such talent, CBS helped usher in the image-conscious, bleeds-it-leads mediocrity of today's news.  Fortunately, Howard K. Smith, Shirer, Sevareid and several others left a rich legacy in books and memoirs, and at this writing one can still hear Richard C. Hottelet report for National Public Radio (NPR).  This book should be required reading for all journalists and corporate news executives.	2000-10-09

I liked reading of his Missouri youth and NBA days, plus his  analysis of economic change, media sensationalism, and the corrosive  influence of money on politics.  Bradley's superb (if short) discourse on  the inner workings of the U.S. Senate provides the type of useful  information one never gets from our sound-bite media. Bradley even takes  issues like water policy and shows why they matter.  The Senator's  blame-whites-only view of racial divisions was rather naive, but even here  he makes some points.  This book is more than a readable memoir; it's a  compassionate, thought-inspiring look at America.	2000-08-12

Our city's greatest columnist, Mike Royko (1933-97) could be  funny, bitter, sentimental, and self-deprecating, all in the same column.  His use of alter ego Slats Grobnik was masterful. In plain English, Royko  took on smug politicians, lazy bureaucrats, hypocrites, crooks and status  seekers.  He sympathized with underdogs, minorities and tavern patrons.   Oddly, Royko favored the rich-yuppie Cubs, but ignored the luckless,  blue-collar White Sox.  The columns on Jackie Robinson (did Royko really  catch that ball?) and the old farmer in Wisconsin are here, but they missed  the one about Ben Wilson's death.  Sadly, this volume contains a mere 110  of Royko's 7,000+ columns. We could use another, thicker edition.	2000-08-03

When Shirer covers the 1940 debacle in the later chapters, it seems almost  pre-destined.  I liked the author's strong attention to the 1930's, when  weak French governments failed to confront a re-arming Nazi Germany.   William L. Shirer (1904-93) was a U.S. journalist in Europe from 1925-40  who later spent years researching the rather baffling subject of the  decline of France. This volume doesn't quite match his &quot;Rise and Fall  of the Third Reich,&quot; but Shirer's immense talents are evident, and  Charles De Gaulle complimented his objectivity.	2000-07-17

Unlike most so-called classics, it's immensely readable, realistic, and concise.  ReMarque was a German veteran of the Great War (World War I), and  he vividly recreates the horror, fear, comradeship, and carnage of the  trenches.  Narrator Paul Baumer (the author in disguise) enthusiastically  enlists in the Kaiser's army, grows disillusioned at the slaughter, then  concludes that soldiers on both sides are helpless victims in a pointless  conflict.  When his friend Leer falls, he asks,&quot;What good is it now  that he was such a good mathematician in school?&quot;  Indeed.  No wonder  the Nazi's banned this book, and then ReMarque, when they took over Germany  in 1933.	2000-07-12

Daley of Chicago	Books	4	9	11	N	N	Good Reading -- But Biased	I recall Mayor Daley's last years, and found this 1970 book by our best columnist a biased but informative look at Chicago and it's politics. Royko covers Daley's rise and years in office,  faulting him as suspicious, vain,  racially insensitive, tied to machine politics, and wrong in 1968 (not  knowing Daley was anti-Vietnam).  But Royko ignores Daley's achievements,  which slowed Chicago's decline (1955-76) when other cities nose-dived.   Many liberals and media folks detested Daley, never grasping how  effectively he led.  Years later, Royko backed Daley's son as mayor.  Big-city machines?  Yeah, but it's nice having a precinct captain nearby.	2000-03-12

Narrator Joe Bonham is a W.W.I. draftee who's wounds leave him blind, deaf, mute, and limb-less. He keeps sane by improving his sense of feel, and by recalling his pre-war days.   Imagine trying to communicate by tapping your head.  Dalton Trumbo (who was  later blacklisted) wrote this novel in 1939, then accepted its suppression  during World War II.  Trumbo didn't quite match &quot;All Quiet on the  Western Front,&quot; but he makes a powerful statement.  This book is  definitely not for the squeamish.	2000-03-08
