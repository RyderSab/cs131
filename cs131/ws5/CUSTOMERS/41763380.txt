As the train travels over the landscape, Louise tells Kate of her life as a child on the Jersey Shore, in a city called Long Branch. It was here the wealthiest families built elaborate homes and whiled away the days and evenings at casinos and racetracks. As her grandmother's story continues, Kate learns that Mollie Brown is actually the daughter of President James Garfield, who served in office only three months before being shot and subsequently dying three months later. During his last days, Garfield was brought back to Long Branch, where it was hoped he would recuperate.  <br /> <br />This is a lovely story about a continuing friendship between two young girls and the events that transpired during an important time in our nation's history. GARFIELD'S TRAIN is a compelling read, blooming with historical facts evolving around history makers of the late nineteenth century. Of interest is the political wrangling that went on before and after Garfield's nomination and subsequent election, and the country's reaction to his failing health after he was shot. An absolute must-read for history and political science lovers as well as anyone who enjoys spending time with a fascinating book.  Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  <br />	2005-09-23

When she arrives at Bill's apartment, it's been trashed and a man with a fake eye tries to kidnap her. If that isn't bad enough, it seems Bill has disappeared with NASCAR driver Sam Hooker's boat. And Hooker's not a happy camper. Hooker trails Barney as she tries to find out the whereabouts of her brother, intrigued by her rebuffs to his advances.

Their adventure takes them into international waters, where they find a cache of gold bars and a mysterious container that creepy men from America and Cuba are anxious to get their hands on. <br /> <br />This is a wonderful read.

While investigating the disappearance of funds from a popular restaurant chain, they agree to take on a case for Molly Saint, who asks for a background check on her husband Damon. When Molly mysteriously disappears, Greg and Jill try to track her whereabouts, which leads to entanglement with contract killers tied to the murder of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve.  <br /> <br />The McKenzie duo is a fresh addition to the mystery genre. An older couple, Greg and Jill complement each other personally and professionally and make for good reading.

As a child, Hunter was precocious and imaginative - a boy who could make arrows out of reeds and bottle tops, turn an adding machine into the control board of a space ship, and transform any number of common household items into innovative toys. Always tagging along was his little brother, Larry, reminding this reviewer of a 20th century Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. The stories told are delivered with humor and wit, in an engaging style. Hidden within the text of each chapter is a subtle moral learned by the delightfully adroit David. Hunter has grown from an imaginative boy into an imaginative man, whose creativity as a writer brings pleasure to his host of fans, of which I am one. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and recommend it highly.  <br /> <br />	2005-09-08

In this installment, Kinsey is hired by ailing Nord Lafferty to pick up his daughter, Reba, from the California Institute for Women and return her home. Reba has served 22 months of a four-year sentence for embezzling funds from her former employer, Alan Beckwith.  Kinsey helps Reba settle in and tries to make sure she stays within the rules of her probation, but Reba has a gambling problem and it doesn't take her long to stray. Kinsey gets pulled into the action when approached by the FBI, soliciting her help in convincing Reba to turn on Alan Beckwith, who has been illegally laundering money for a known criminal. When Reba steals money from Beckwith and takes off, Kinsey's not far behind. <br />  <br />Grafton delivers a fine romp with this one, with some really likable characters, Reba in the forefront. I kept waiting for Kinsey to stand up to Nord's bossy girlfriend, but that didn't happen. Sometimes Kinsey's just too nice. But finally, she has a boyfriend who holds a whiff of a promise, and I enjoyed their growing relationship. All fans of Grafton and anyone who likes a good mystery will enjoy this book. As always, she delivers an entertaining, fun read. <br />	2005-08-09

A man who never would have attained his doctorate without the help of family connections. A marine biologist who doesn't even now which way the Gulf Stream runs. As proof of what a total idiot this man is, he decides to kill the one good thing in his life, his wife Joey, by throwing her over the side of a cruise liner during their anniversary cruise. But Chaz seems to have forgotten Joey is an athlete who swam for her college team. His reason: he thinks she's onto the fact that he is doctoring water samples for Red Hammernut, a millionaire farmer dumping fertilizer contaminants into the Everglades.     Joey literally clings to life via a bale of marijuana and is plucked from the ocean by Mick Stranahan, former investigator now island beach bum. Instead of reporting Chaz to the police, Joey decides to get him back with the help of Mick. And the fun really starts!     This is one of the wackiest books I've ever read. The characters are off the wall, from Tool, a hairy giant walking around with a bullet up his rear,to the investigating detective, Karl Rolvaag, a misplaced Norwegian who pines for the calmer life of Minnesota. Kind of like reading a Southern Fargo. The dialogue is great, the plot fun, and the read one I definitely did not want to end.	2005-08-04

Robb a/k/a Nora Roberts is one of the most prolific authors I've ever read. How she manages to produce books that remain fresh and vibrant attests to her incredible talent and creative imagination. I've read this series out of order, but each book is written so that the book itself can stand alone. This one, however, revealed to me the reason behind Eve's sometimes belligerent attitude, her strong persona, and standoffishness. Robb is great at revealing subtle conflicts, inner turmoils. Great book!	2005-07-18

Adopted at infancy, Maura learns the dead woman is her identical twin sister. In her search to find out more about her own biological family, as well as who killed her sister, Maura finds herself heading down a path filled with death and into the midst of an adoption ring involving dead pregnant women. Detective Jane Rizzoli plays second fiddle to Maura, but, as always, she is one of the best characters in the book. I admire the way she handles her pregnancy and her grim resolve to be the best cop on the force.<br /><br />I absolutely love this series and cannot get enough of Maura or Jane, two strong, independent women. This is a fantastic thriller, filled with suspense, with twists and turns at every corner. Highly recommended.	2005-07-18

However, this does not deter her from her determination to find out why her friends were killed. Lucas Swain, the CIA agent sent to track her down, is drawn into Lily's quest, and together they face extreme danger while falling in love with one another.  <br /> <br />Linda Howard is absolutely the best at romantic suspense.

But to summarize, this book is an intriguing look into the lives of the wife and four daughters of a fascist preacher intent on converting the Congolese people to his form of religion. As though reading a continuing journal, each of the five women tells their own story of the trials and tribulations they were forced to endure during their time in the Congo.  <br /> <br />Interwoven with historical facts, vivid descriptions of the people and places, this is a wonderful book. Barbara Kingsolver is a fantastic storyteller, and I recommend this book to everyone. <br />	2005-06-27

In this installment, Scarpetta is called back to Richmond, Virginia by the present Chief Medial Examiner, to consult regarding the mysterious death of a 14-year-old girl. Marino tags along, which always makes the story that much better. Parallel to Scarpetta's investigation, Lucy is dealing with her own troubles after someone attacks a friend and plants a bomb in her mailbox.  <br /> <br />This is one of my favorites so far in the series- Scarpetta is an excellent character, a woman who seems distant and aloof but has much inner warmth and empathy. Although Marino is now physically healthier, he still has that raw edge which is so appealing. I absolutely love Cornwell's writing style - the fast pace, packed with suspense, with wonderful characters and plot. Highly recommended.  <br /> <br />	2005-06-13

Although it was disconcerting the manner in which Amy Wu assumed her client's guilt and pushed hard for him to cut a deal with the DA, I'm sure this is something fairly common in our legal system. Recommended for those readers who love a good thriller. <br />	2005-05-26

When Deedra's husband is killed in a car wreck, she finds herself adrift and unsure of herself. Deedra decides to run the restaurant her husband owned in order to keep occupied and gain more independence. When Josh McKenzie steps into the restaurant, she is not prepared for her body's heated reaction to him, nor her instant mental rejection of the man.  <br /> <br />Josh McKenzie does not hold much respect for women after divorcing his wife, who seemed to want him only for monetary gains. But when Josh meets Deedra, he senses a specialness about her and becomes determined to make her his own. Which proves to be difficult, as Deedra thwarts his advances at each and every turn.  <br /> <br />Katlyn Stewart provides a fun, tantalizing read with FIRE IN THE ICE, playing to great advantage the sexual chemistry between Deedra and Josh. The story is heartwarming; a life journey for two people with diverse personalities who challenge one another in ways neither has faced before. The mindset of the characters is portrayed with sensitivity, realism and true clarity, the plot paced to perfection. But one cannot forget the love story, which is the essence of the book, one that will linger in the mind long after the read is finished.   <br /> <br />	2005-04-25

Unlike the Greek tragedy, this book is told from the point of view of Iokaste and takes the tale many levels higher, revealing psychological subtleties within the personas of Iokaste and the characters surrounding her. At age 14, Iokaste is chosen by the god Apollo to wed Prince Alphenor, son of King Amphion of Thebes. When Amphion's wife blasphemes the god Apollo, the oracle predicts doom for her 14 children, and Iokaste's betrothed dies. Laius, son of King Labdakus, who ruled Thebes 30 years before, returns to Thebes to claim the kingdom and weds Iokaste. On the night of their wedding, the oracle warns Laius that he will be killed by his own son. Laius withdraws from Iokaste, not knowing she is already with child. When their son is born, Laius binds his feet and instructs he be left on a mountain to die. Instead, the child is given to King Polybus of Korinth, who recently lost his son. Polybus names the child Oedipus, meaning swollen feet.  <br /> <br />As a young man, Oedipus is told by the Delphic oracle that he will kill his father and marry his mother. Never having learned he was adopted, Oedipus is distraught over this news and vows never to see his parents again. He meets up with Laius, who is traveling to Delphi to seek the oracle's counsel, and the two argue. Oedipus kills Laius, unaware that he has set in motion the ultimate fulfillment of the oracle's prophecy.  <br /> <br />With profound vibrancy, IOKASTE magically transports the reader into the ancient world of Greek mythology. The visual imagery created by the authors is vividly detailed, the mindset of the characters engrossing. It is interesting to note the politics of the time, constant dedication to the ritualistic worship of gods, and delegation of all things good and bad to a particular god's mood. The Sphinx is a fascinating character, made more realistic by her portrayal in this book, specifically her role in the contest of wit to choose the next king of Thebes. The conspiracies and subsequent rationalizations of Iokaste and her brother Kreon are thought-provoking and insightful.  <br /> <br />This riveting story flows fluidly from page to page, written in an engaging style that holds the reader's attention from the very beginning. This is one book that begs to be read more than once in order to appreciate and absorb each and every nuance of the characters, history, and tale of tragedy. It is suggested educational facilities utilize IOKASTE as an introduction to Greek mythology, as this is one book that will instill fascination and respect, leaving no room for boredom. <br />	2005-04-07

Written in the first person, Odd is a mesmerizing character who seems so much more mature for his age, due in part to his traumatic childhood.   <br /> <br />Koontz delivers characters with finesse; in my opinion, no one can write an evil character better than he does.

Jeannie's brother, Henry, marries Linda Mae, and before long, Jeannie finds she is to become an aunt. Billy Joe begins to work for the new bank in their small town, and he and Helga agree to become engaged.  Jeannie works out an arrangement with Helga's father to buy land from him for the horse ranch she has long dreamed about. She begins to make plans to build her ranch and asks Slim to be her ranch foreman, unaware of the interest Billy Joe's brother, Jack, has begun to show toward her.  Along the way, Jeannie learns a poignant lesson when she is forced to deal with prejudice against the Comanche family in their community, from whom she learns how to weave baskets and to utilize plants for medicinal purposes.  <br />America's present-day Laura Ingalls Wilder, Ms. Horan is an author who possesses the unique ability to weave an entertaining, inspirational story with factual history.  As with the first two books in the series, the reader is left eagerly anticipating what will happen next to Jeannie, her family, and friends.  This is one series I would like to see continue on - reading each book feels like spending time with an old friend - and would love to see in classrooms across America.  A delightful read for the child in all of us.	2004-01-04

Each chapter shares a different lesson the seven boys, ages 8 to 12 years, learn together.  The leader of the group of boys, Oliver, called Big O by the others, is large and brash, and although the other boys are somewhat intimidated by the Big O, they know he is mostly all talk. Throughout the stories is another, mysterious boy, John Allen, who is not a member of the group yet seems to convey wisdom beyond his years as well as mystical powers.  John Allen always shows up when the boys need him most and is not only their voice of reason but healer of hurts, as well.<br />Mr. Gorman's writing reminds the reader of a simpler, more naïve America, and offers a nostalgic look at a time when doors did not need to be locked and drugs did not abound in neighborhoods, a time when summers were spent riding bikes and playing baseball or basketball. The interactions between the boys are fun to read and reminiscent of the innocence of childhood.  Wonderfully written and warmly delivered, \\"The Old Neighborhood\\" is a book all readers, child as well as adult, will enjoy.	2003-11-24

This is a glaring look at domestic abuse from a child's eyes and offers insight into the sequelae resulting to children who are raised with a parent who abuses the other.  <br />Kealman bases his story on actual childhood events and relates throughout the book the emotional instability and physical trauma left behind when abuse occurs in a family.   He points out that abuse can be mental as well as physical and can come from any member of the household.  He also rather poignantly states that learning to recognize abuse can be the first step in healing.<br />Kealman poses these questions, which are quite profound:<br />     Where do you store it all?  How do you empty the brain?<BR>     How are you supposed to forget?<br />Kealman relates the different ways his siblings dealt with the abuse and the unfolding relationship between himself and his father, who was the abuser.  It is refreshing to read that Kealman took a terrible situation and made something good of it: he used it as a learning experience for ways not to behave as a husband and father and, as a consequence, became a better spouse to his wife and parent to his daughter.  <br />Kealman points out that the abuse cycle can be broken and that there is help available to victims of abuse.  He asks his readers to pass the book on when they are finished, and it is hoped that this book will help those who are dealing with abuse in their lives, as well as those who are abusing others.	2003-10-19

They are incarcerated in separate juvenile facilities for seven years, then released with warnings to stay away from each other.  Ronnie, who has always been looked upon as the \\"bad girl,\\" tries to engage herself in as normal a life as she can have.  Alice, on the other hand, always considered the \\"good girl\\" who was simply following Ronnie's lead, seems to be content to stay at home or take long, mysterious walks.  Shortly after their return, small girls begin to disappear for short periods.  When a young interracial girl is kidnapped, the police begin to focus their investigation on Ronnie and Alice.  <br />With the Tess Monaghan series, Lippman has become known for her witty dialogue and realistic characters, but \\"Every Secret Thing\\" proves her ability to delve into more complex, darker characters.   Her portrayal of Alice's mother is fascinating, as well as her depiction of the former, then present, mental states of Alice and Ronnie.  She weaves past with present as she tells the story of what happened with the baby Alice and Ronnie are accused of murdering.  A fascinating look at a dark subject and a book which proves Laura Lippman is an author who herself stands out.	2003-10-19

As the smallest of the dragons, Red Vest is picked on by some of the other dragons, so chooses to stay to himself most of the time.  Realizing he is bored, Red Vest visits the Clan's leader, Old Dragon, who is very wise, and asks for his advice.  Old Dragon tells him to go to the bottom of a mountain, to a large tree by the river, and stand by the path leading into the hills.  There, Red Vest meets a young woman named Amanda, who comes to the river each morning to fill her pails with water.  Day after day, Amanda comes to the stream and listens raptly as Red Vest tells her about his life as a dragon.  One day, Amanda does not come to the river, but her father does.  He tells Red Vest that he has forbidden Amanda to visit him because she loves him and wants to do nothing more than listen to his stories. Red Vest and Amanda are devastated, but when Amanda disobeys her father's wishes and visits Red Vest the next day, she finds that love has woven a magical spell over her dragon.<br />\\"The Dragon Who Was Bored\\" is wonderfully written and a delight to read.  Children as well as adults will be mesmerized by the love story interwoven within the fable of the dragon. This would make a valuable addition to any child's bedroom, library or classroom.	2003-10-15

Ms. Newby magically weaves past with present to create a compelling Christian romance suitable for all readers.  <br />Emily Taylor, a teacher in Knoxville, Tennessee, returns to her grandparents' homeplace outside Cumberland Gap, Tennessee for a three-week stay after her grandfather's death.  Emily discovers a chest that belonged to her grandmother containing an antiquated wedding dress, Confederate uniform, Union soldier's cap, and a diary from one of Emily's ancestors, a young woman named Rebecca.  Hidden inside the lining of the cap is a love letter from a soldier named Stephen Lucas to his beloved Rebecca.  Evan Lucas has returned to Cumberland Gap, Tennessee from a disappointing stay in New York to restore the Victorian home that has been in his family for generations.  During the restoration, he finds a hidden safe containing the original plans for the house, old photographs, and a set of silver wedding rings.  When Emily discovers that the owner of the Union soldier's cap is an antecedent of Evan, she gives him the cap, and agrees to help him with decorating decisions concerning the Victorian home he is trying to recapture.  Evan and Emily are drawn to one another, but both have been hurt from past relationships, so are wary of their attraction.<br />Interwoven throughout the present-day love story is the love story from the past between Rebecca and Stephen, which is divulged through Rebecca's diary.  Although Rebecca's family fought for the Confederacy, Stephen decided to return North to fight for the Union, causing the young couple to be separated before they could wed.  Rebecca's diary reveals much factual information about the Civil War as well as Rebecca's concern and worry for her beloved Stephen.  <br />T. C. Newby has written a mesmerizing story delivered with eloquence and style.  As a Southerner, it was refreshing to see the differing views concerning the Civil War (aside from the issue of slavery) expressed in a noble and understanding way.  Rebecca's writings about the war and her family, as well as her love for Stephen, are captivating.  The gentle mysteries as to what happened to Rebecca and Stephen as well as to whom the wedding rings belonged are revealed smoothly and with finesse. A wonderful book by this first-time author I would highly recommend to everyone, including Civil War history buffs.	2003-10-10

Each First Lady is given her own chapter to write about herself and her experiences while in the White House, with comments from other First Ladies colloquialized throughout. <br />These First Ladies were as diverse physically as they were in regards to personality, and the vast majority were intelligent, articulate women possessing great insight.  It is interesting to note the steady idealistic progression of women throughout our history, as seen through the eyes of these First Ladies.  Their differing views regarding slavery, suffrage, temperance, fidelity, and a woman's role in the workforce are fascinating to read.  <br />Most of the First Ladies were very much in love with their husbands, although there were some who were not so enamored.  Even though many of these women enjoyed their days in the White House, there were those who abhorred it.  Some wished to stand apart and be remembered, while others desired only to return to what they considered their real home life.  The conversations among the ladies are interesting and fun to read, especially the snippets between Abigail Adams and her daughter-in-law Louisa Adams, and Mary Lincoln and Julia Grant.  <br />The only constant between this steady flow of women is that they were married to Presidents of the United States.  It appears that more than a few were from the state of Ohio and that most of these First Ladies outlived their husbands.  The majority never dreamed they would one day inhabit the White House, while there weresome who strove to occupy that space.<br />An engaging, delightful read filled with historical facts and fun conversational tidbits among the First Ladies, such that at times, I felt as if I were in a room, listening to these women speak.  This is a grand concept by this author and a book I highly recommend to all readers, whether history buff or not.	2003-10-01

She writes with vast knowledge of her subject, as well as the psychological field, past-life-regression, and law enforcement.

I think this is the third entry in the Victor Carl series, and I'm ordering the prior two.<br />Victor Carl is a somewhat seedy criminal defense lawyer who is not above manipulating the legal system.  PI Phil Skink is a masterpiece: a man with a face that would stop a clock, who dresses in brown suits, wears a fedora, and talks like a gangster from the '30's.  The interplay between Carl and Skink is sharp-tongued, chiseled, and testosterone-driven, yet the two play off one another n a fun, comedic way.<br />This is a real jewel of a book.  The story is fast-paced, filled with witty dialogue and flawed characters.  The courtroom drama is the best!  The plot twists may be somewhat predictable, but the final twist will not be expected.  Lashner is a writer with a unique voice who is definitely best-seller material.	2003-07-14

Wasn't too sure I liked the ending with &quot;Beyond Suspicion,&quot; but I have nothing but positive comments to make about &quot;Last to Die&quot;.<br />Sally Fenning, young, beautiful and very rich, does not want to live.  She tries to hire former contract killer Tatum Knight, brother of Jack Swyteck's best friend, Theo, to murder her.  Although Tatum claims he turned her down, Sally is murdered two weeks later. Tatum hires Jack to represent him since Sally had named him as one of the six beneficiaries to her estate.  Here's the catch: the 46 million dollars will not be disbursed until all of the heirs but one are deceased.  That's where the fun starts.<br />Grippando touches upon a very real, very tragic world situation in this book: child slavery in Africa, where thousands of children are forced to labor in cocoa fields.  Believe me, I look at chocolate in a different way now.  However, he balances this dark subject with the lighter, comedic relationship between Jack and his somewhat unsavory but lovable friend, Theo.  <br />I think Grippando is proving himself to be a mainstay in the legal thriller arena and each book in the Swyteck series seems to entrench him further in a genre that had become tired until he put Swyteck to paper.  I'm a fan!	2003-07-14

I recognized the name Stephen Cannell as a producer but did not know he also wrote books. This was the first of Mr. Cannell's books I've read and I very quickly became a fan. I love his sense of humor and fast-paced style.  Shane Scully is great and the interplay in this book between Scully and the major players of Hollywood is hilarious.  I loved all the zany charaters Cannell introduces in this book, especially Nicky, the grifter who claims to have found Jesus. I like that Scully seems to be reevaluating his life and mellowing.  His wife Alexa is one of the best female characters out there.  She's strong, intelligent, and warm but can stand her ground with anyone.  The fact that she is Scully's boss and he isn't threatened in the least by this shows his strength of character.  Now, onto the other works by Mr. Cannell.  Great book!	2003-02-27

This is the first book I've read by Sherrilyn Kenyon but will not be the last.  The primary characters are wonderfully developed and written, and the book moves at a good pace. A great read by an author who deserves to claim the title national bestselling author.	2003-02-26

I have to be honest, I  hadn't heard of the Sweet Potato Queens, even though I live in the South, but the title of this one caught my eye.  &quot;The Sweet Potato Queens' Book of Love&quot; by Jill Conner Browne will not only make you laugh, it will make you hungry!

I just finished this book and thought it one of the best of the 87th Precinct novels so far.  Oliver Wendall Weeks, aka Fat Ollie, is so obnoxious, he's hilarious.  He's obese but considers himself simply a large man who hates fat people. As McBain describes him, he is an equal opportunity bigot.  McBain gives his reader something you can count on him to provide with each book: the joke. I always look forward to that.<br />In this installment, Ollie has written a book, all 36 pages, which reads like an actual police report.  Ollie's car is burglarized while he's investigating the fatal shooting of city councilman Lester Henderson, and his manuscript is stolen. The burglar, Emilio Herrera is also a transvestite and somewhat dim-witted.  He thinks Ollie's book is an actual police report.  From there, the book just gets better and better.  The investigation into the councilman's death is mainly handled by the best of the 87th detectives: Steve Carella and Bert Kling.  <br />There isn't much of a mystery here - I figured that out rather quickly.  But this is a wonderful book which is so funny in places, you'll laugh out loud.	2003-02-05

I have been a huge fan of Victoria Taylor Murray since her first book was released, and book three in the Lambert series proves this author's talent grows stronger with each book. With most series, by the third one, it all starts to get a little boring. Well, boring is not what you get here! No one can write romantic suspense like Murray. She's better than any of the bestselling authors out there.  Her books sizzle and keep the reader enthralled. A great love story that will leave you wanting more. I am sure this series will catapult this author to bestselling status and I am anxiously awaiting number four. If I could give this book more than 5 stars, I would.	2003-02-03

The story stretches over one day in the life of the protagonist and explores the intricacies of human relationships, women with men, and women with women. The pain and anguish Ms. Woolf manages to portray are vivid, and proof of her genuis as a writer.  If you're looking for a book with a substantial plot or even minimal action, this is not for you. &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; instead relies on dialogue and inner thoughts of the characters to carry it along.  I can see why it has been referred to as a classic.	2003-01-19

Her journey during this period of time is a painful one, and Ms. Johnson has the unique ability to convey the anguish and confusion she felt so as the reader feels as if she/he is there sharing it with her.  I love the story about Indian John and, even more, the one about the grass dance.  When the author talks about dancing the grass dance at John's grave, I could feel myself transported to that place, see the wild grass and wildflowers moving softly in the wind, watch Laurel dance around the grave.  What did I learn from this book?  That God is everywhere, and even though we may distance ourselves from him, he does not distance himself from us.  To look around at my world and at all the wonders before me.  To know that, like the grass and the wind, life may &quot;bend&quot; my spirit, but will not break it, as long as I believe.

Never have I read a book so wrought with emotion, feeling as if I had stepped into that time and place to experience the sadness and despair, the pain and anguish, the love and joy.

Book Two of the series \\"Jeannie, a Texas Frontier Girl,\\" by Evelyn Horan is, without a doubt, the best children's book I've read since, well, the first one.  Ms. Horan's work has been compared to that of Laura Ingalls Wilder, but in my opinion, she has proven to be an even better author.   These books may be for children, but I, even though I am an adult, love them, and as I'm reading, I cannot wait to see what happens next with Jeannie and her family and good friend, Helga.  The setting is the Texas frontier during the late 1800's, and Ms. Horan does an excellent job at edifying while entertaining the reader. Horan makes a wonderful transition from the first to the second book, and in Book Two, we see Jeannie and her friend Helga starting to grow up, the changes that take place in both Jeannie's and Helga's families, are introduced to a Comanche Indian family, and dream along with Jeannie as to what her future will hold. I'm excitedly looking forward to Book Three and hope Ms. Horan will continue these books for years to come.  Ms. Horan is our present-day Wilder, an author whose work is so wholesome and wonderful, and I predict she will be a national bestseller in a very short amount of time.  Cudos for an excellent book.	2002-11-11

Ms. Barry has the unique ability to introduce her characters in such a way that by the end of the first chapter, the reader is well-acquainted, a method well-utilized by Elmore Leonard.  This book is a fast read and moves quickly with twists and turns that caught me off-guard but added dimension to the story.

We have all experienced or will experience the death of a loved one during our lifetime, and, in my opinion, there is no better book to be found regarding the terrible ordeal of dealing with death than \\"Conquering the Mysteries and Lies of Grief\\" by author Sherry Russell. Ms. Russell has written an informative, well-researched, edifying book that explains in layman's terms how to deal with the sequelae resulting from a loved one's death, including stress, anxiety, anger, and depression. I particularly found interesting her Maze with the 7 \\"A\\" stones, which was very insightful. Of particular interest also are the personal interviews throughout the book, offering a glimpse into the wide spectrum of grief from people who have experienced it. This is a book much needed, especially during this time, and I would recommend it for everyone.	2002-09-22

She leaves me hanging each time, anxiously waiting for the next book in the series, wondering what's going to develop between Stephanie, her boyfriend, Morelli, and mystery man, Ranger.  If you like a good read with plenty of laughs that moves at a fast pace, pick Evanovich.	2002-06-08

I wasn't sure I'd like this book, to be honest, as I don't usually read this genre, but being an avid gardener, I was interested, and boy, am I glad I took the plunge.  A very interesting and edifying read - ranging from tulips to potatoes to apples to marijuana and how they interact with the human race and we with them.  Try it!	2002-06-08

Once more Ms. Murray offers a book abounding with much mystery, suspense, intrigue, and (what she is so wonderful at) romance!  If you ever want to read a book that will get you in &quot;the mood,&quot; read Ms. Murray's works.  <br />Another great book by a talented writer who I believe will be a very well-known author within a very short time.  As I've said before, move over Danielle Steel and Mary Higgins Clark - Ms. Murray's coming your way!	2002-05-25

I won't go into a lengthy description about this book as I see that has previously been wonderfully done, but I would like to say that as a person who watched a boyfriend go off to die in Vietnam, who has never understood the way our Vietnam vets were so terribly treated, nor why they cannot be recognized for the heroes they are, hopefully this book will bring this war more into the forefront. So much damage was done to our young soldiers during this war, so many came home not only physically damaged but mentally as well. We need to understand what they faced, what they went thru, and how they survived. Bravo, Mr. Moore and Mr. Galloway, and thank you!	2002-03-03

Being one of the 60% or so of Americans concerned with the ecology, the economy, America's place in the world, constant threat of terrorism, nuclear war, etc . .. and one who is constantly frustrated that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer while the middle-class American supports them all.  Thank you, Mr. Moore.  Take his advice, get involved with government, do what it takes to turn this country around and on the right track.  The middle-class American has stayed moot for too long and taken more than they should have. We have the power and should use it.  It's time to end the malaise.	2002-02-22

The reader is allowed to visit the American Southwest during a period of time when life seemed so much simpler, albeit, in ways, much harder.

Ms. Barry portrays the protagonist in a sensitive, compelling way, allowing us to share in her life as she tries to deal with a rebellious daughter, an adulterous husband, a friend with a secret past, a move to a new city, and a pastor with a wandering eye. This book offers humor, a little mystery, and an entertaining look at how one woman deals with her life which seems to have turned into a soap opera.<br />Don't start reading this one until you know you have time to read it straight through, because I guaranty you will not want to put it down.  Ms. Barry has a unique talent for grabbing the reader's attention and holding it throughout.  A fast-paced, delightful book which I highly recommend.	2002-01-30
