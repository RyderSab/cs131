They may have read about that theory in this book. However, much of the &quot;support&quot; this book presents for the theory is hand-waving. There are huge discrepancies -- for example, &quot;Eddy&quot; wasn't in town for most of the murders.<br />I read this book in high school for a history book report project. I think one reason I got a good grade on the report was because I pointed out that the author tended to ignore or brush aside facts that didn't fit his theory. By the way, I thought of giving this book two stars because it read quickly and because it was the first Ripper book I read. However, the facts were so misused that I cannot do so. If this had been published as a novel, I would have rated it much higher because it was so interesting. As nonfiction, it doesn't work.<br />If you read this Ripper book and don't read any of the better books, you are depriving yourself. There are much better resources out there. At the very least, visit the casebook dot org site. The realistic Ripper theories aren't as interesting as theories like this one, but at least they make sense.	2003-05-26

It's so frustrating that Dickens died before completing this novel. On the other hand, the fact that this classic British mystery was never finished has created a great opportunity for literary critics and mystery lovers alike to try to solve the mystery for themselves. We'll never know who Dickens really had in mind as the murderer, or if indeed there was a murder after all. That's a huge loss. But it's a great ride for readers to try to make up their own minds.<br />I still haven't made up my mind about who did it. Sure, there is a very obvious suspect in Jasper, but that doesn't mean Dickens thought he did it. Some people have speculated that Dickens wrote this novel as a tribute to his friend Wilkie Collins' \\"The Moonstone,\\" so perhaps the opium addiction would have played a huge part in the mystery. It's even possible that Dickens saw a bit of himself in Jasper's tortured love life because of the way it paralleled his own life. After all, Cloisterham is supposed to be based on Dickens' Rochester. Then again, just because Dickens sympathized with someone, that doesn't mean that character was innocent, either, does it? Now you see why this story continues to torment mystery lovers.<br />Like any other Dickens novel, this one has lots of memorable characters, from the suspicious and tormented Jasper to the Reverend Crisparkle to Princess Puffer. And of course, the enigmatic Datchery. The gravedigger and his obnoxious but perceptive boy assistant provide both Dickensian  eccentric characters and possible clues.<br />The power of this book even today is clear in the way it inspired an award-winning Broadway musical where the audience got to solve the mystery on their own. (By the way, 1935 movie with Claude Rains was good, but some of the main characters were cut out, and others seemed little like the characters in the book, even if they were fine actors.)<br />Anne M.

This book manages to combine military SF, comedy (both slapstick and wordplay), satire, class wars, cloning, and genetic engineering with a little romance and still come out swinging. These collaborators can really, well, collaborate.<br />The hero is the sole human survivor of his platoon. Chip is trapped behind enemy lines (&quot;way behind enemy lines&quot; as one chapter title puts it). His compatriots are genetically engineered &quot;rats&quot; and bats. Imagine if Shakespeare's comical secondary characters were forced to spend time in close quarters with rebellious Irish poets, and you get the general idea of the chaos.<br />Mix with the daughter of a wealthy shareholder, her alien tutor, and her fluffy companion. Add the clashes between a military commander who knows what he's doing and lots and lots of &quot;authority&quot; figures who don't. Shake and stir.<br />I read this in the e-book edition (which you can purchase through Baen's Webscription program), but I enjoyed it enough that I'd like to buy the paperback when it comes out. It will be worth it for the cover alone.<br />My only real problem is that I kinda sorta figured out a major surprise a little too early.

I downloaded it because it was free, and that  made it attractive to me. As I read the book, though, I realized that the  ideas are common sense. It hit home the first time I signed up for PayPal  -- one of the best examples of an ideavirus. <br />In fact, now that I have  read &quot;Unleashing the Ideavirus,&quot; I can spot mistakes made by  Internet-based companies. For example, companies that change the rules in  midstream are doomed to lose business.<br />While Seth Godin loves the idea of  the &quot;Tell a Friend&quot; feature, I think it has one flaw he forgot to  address. Some people are afraid to enter their friends' e-mail addresses  because they don't want their friends to get spam. While many companies  don't sell those addresses, some do. Until more companies learn the  importance of privacy, I will be reluctant to use the &quot;Tell a  Friend&quot; feature.<br />My other complaint was that the book gets  repetitive in some spots. Certain ideas are repeated so often that I  started skimming those pages.<br />Anne M. Marble -- All About Romance	2000-09-17

I also read &quot;Bored of the Rings&quot; and enjoyed it as a parody of that great work. Some people seem to think that the two are mutually exclusive.  You can't love LOTR and enjoy BOTR, and if you laughed at BOTR, you must  not really understand Tolkien. I think that's silly -- if you know LOTR,  you will appreciate the jokes more, as long as you don't take yourself too  seriously.<br />Even great works such as &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; are  not above parody.

(Alsemero who! )  I envy the performers who get to play DeFlores and Beatrice-Joanna.<br />A lot  of scholarly treatises about the play criticized the humorous subplot,  claiming that it had no relevance and no connection to the main plot.

Not only is the plot different in some ways, but some of the best (and most intelligent)  dialogue never made it into the movie. <br />Speaking of intelligence, Thomas  Harris isn't afraid to drop cultural references (such as Glenn Gould and  Marcus Aurelius). That's refreshing at a time when many editors are forcing  writers to &quot;dumb down&quot; their work.<br />Yes, this is a novel about a  serial killer who terrifies a nation. But it's also about Clarice Starling  and her journey of self-discovery. And about the nature of evil. There are  grisly scenes -- but this novel rises above being a mere gorefest.<br />I've  read lots of other serial killer novels. None came up to the level of this  one.

Or maybe it is silly, and it was such a gripping read that I never noticed.<br />A family's idyllic stay in a Long Island house  quickly turns to horror. First, they learn that there are lots of strays,  abandoned by inconsiderate tourists before they went back home. Then, even  worse, the stray cats start to attack. The attacks start out small, but  quickly escalate to terror.<br />Stories like this usually stink because they  make no sense. But Berton Roueche was the author of the classic work  &quot;The Medical Detectives&quot; and won several medical journalism  awards. His background -- and his message about how we treat our pets --  keeps this from being a sleazy &quot;attack of the animals&quot;  story.<br />Anne M. Marble Reviewer, All About Romance	2000-05-20

To solve these murders, he must  get close to the dark side -- so close that it's scary. He pays a heavy  price for his work.<br />Thomas Harris often writes about horrible things, but  without sensationalizing them. Maybe it's because of his journalism  background, or maybe that's just his style. He's no slouch at  characterization, either. Also, he doesn't underestimate the intelligence  of his readers. He drops in cultural references without patronizingly  explaining them.<br />Many other writers have tried to imitate Thomas Harris.

It doesn't take  Tarquin long to figure out he would be crazy to marry any of his  &quot;perfect&quot; brides, no matter how much planning went into their  selection. It takes him a little longer to admit that the best choice has  been in front of him all along.<br />The would-be brides add much of the humor  -- but the funniest moments come from Tarquin's reactions to the chaos.  <br />Though this is a farce, don't let that keep you away.

I love romantic suspense and Gothic novels about heroines who find themselves drawn to a man who could be a killer. Yet this book wasn't all it could have been. <br />Part of  the problem was that it took Steve and Alex too long to meet. Also, there  weren't enough red herrings. (This is probably the first romantic suspense  novel I've read that suffered because it had too *few* characters.) It  didn't help that Alex lied to Steve for most of the book.<br />Did Steve  Chapman kill his wife? Reporter Alexandra Webster goes undercover (as one  of his employees) to find out. Before long, he starts to question what she  has heard about him. What will she do when he finds out the truth about her  purpose? And what did Steve's son witness that left him so  traumatized?<br />Despite its problems, this book has some wonderful elements.  The island made a great, isolated setting. The unfinished house on the  island is just as creepy as an old house on the moors of Cornwall. Also,  Steve's son is a terrific character, and the scenes with him are  touching.<br />Anne M.

Even if you like this kind of book, it could still make you  uneasy.<br />I'm a big fan of Gothics. Many Gothics used the plot about the  woman who is sucked into a relationship with a man who could be a murderer.  Rarely, however, did the authors go beyond the basics of the story,  exploiting the simplistic thrill of the plot -- but missing what makes it  tick. In the worst of these books, the heroines had no interior life, no  logic. <br />This book is not like that. When this book is over, you'll know  why the characters acted as they did.

They could've  walked right off the set of a romantic comedy, except they seem to have  rewritten all the scripts...<br />By the way, secondary character Raven gets  his own story in &quot;Rough and Rugged,&quot; part of Harlequin Duets #22.  He has shaved, but I'm sure he's just as fun.<br />Anne M. Marble Reviewer,  All About Romance	2000-05-11

Sure, it's a book about a man who defeated poverty and overcame adversity to become one of the greatest Olympic gold medalists. <br />But Jesse Owens is honest about the turbulent  times he endured after the Olympics were over. Just as importantly, he also  tells the story about how he almost let his faith in God fall along the  wayside.

I read this book because a reviewer raved about it -- but told his readers to skip the last chapter. With a recommendation like that, what could I do but read the entire book, especially the last chapter? I'm still undecided  about whether I approved of the ending, but I'm glad I disobeyed the  reviewer and read it anyway.<br />This is as much a character study about its  detective as it is a mystery. It also lets the reader visit a side of  America most of us have never seen. <br />Be warned that this novel can be  grim. Alcohol isn't just prevalent, it's as vital as air to these people.  These characters could drink Nick and Nora Charles under the table, and  would probably pick their pockets after they passed out.<br />Anne M.

I read a so-so ghost romance last year, and it made me yearn to read this book again.<br />Maybe this book rises above those others  because it sets its ghostly element in a realistic setting populated with  believable people. Sure, the captain is a crusy sailor, but there's a real  person there, even if he is a ghost. Mrs. Muir holds her own, too -- none  but the strong could endure that household.<br />The book surpasses both the  movie and the TV show.

The hero, Lord Alan, is a scientist instead of a Regency dandy. The heroine, Ariel, is trying to find out if her mother's ghost is really haunting the Regent's  parties.<br />However, Lord Alan is so caught up in the sciences that he can't  appreciate simple things in life, such as the theater. Everything has to be  logical. I have a degree in biology, and I've *never* met a scientist like  that.<br />Even worse, Lord Alan treats Ariel quite arrogantly at first. He  assumes that because she's a woman, she must be interested only in trivial  things. Not a *logical* attitude for someone whose mother was a pioneer in  the education of women!<br />Over the time, the chip slides off his shoulder.  But the first half of this novel was spoiled by his attitude. Only Ariel  and the mystery kept me reading. Jane Ashford must be a good writer to keep  me reading, even when the hero thinks all women are vapid -- so maybe I'll  read one of her future movels.<br />Anne M.

It's a good example of &quot;techno-horror.&quot; (Not as good as Dean Koontz's &quot;Midnight,&quot; but still pretty cool.)<br />The idea of a coach going  to such a length to turn his players in &quot;superhuman&quot; (or rather,  superinhuman) athletes seems far-fetched at first. Until you think of the  Texas Cheerleader Mom case. Not to mention the steroid abuse going on in so  many places.<br />However, I can't recommend it fully because I don't think  the ending lived up to the promise of the novel. Also, the deeper issues  are not explored well enough.<br />For a better book along this topic, try  Christopher Pike's &quot;Monster.&quot; Yeah, I know, it's a young adult  novel.

Also, I love horror stories that make me feel sympathetic  for characters who were mistreated by people who should've loved  them.<br />This reminded me of the books of this type I used to read in high  school -- except that it was better written. The characters are much more  memorable.<br />However, I think the story fizzled out in the last couple of  editions of the the serial.

Laura Kinsale and the Gothic hero seem like the perfect combination. Is he insane? Or is someone really trying to kill him? Plus, the letters were charming.<br />But then, the plot  went off in a different tangent, and it was as if another story was being  told. It's the bizarre plot elements from the latter half keep this from  getting a higher grade. <br />The characters are realistic, though they're not  Kinsale's best. Or at least not her most interesting. Robert is not a  typical Kinsale hero -- and perhaps this plot could have used one of  those.<br />Read &quot;The Flowers of the Storm&quot; or &quot;The Shadow and  the Star&quot; for a better Kinsale.<br />Anne M.

There are plenty of dark moments. Characters we care about  our hurt, both physically and mentally. Miles and Mark are both put through  the wringer -- but they come out better men because of it.<br />If your idea  of an SF novel is something with an exciting plot and identifiable  characters... come on in!

It was probably the perfect book to introduce a teen-ager to the possibilities of SF. While it dealt with some dark themes, such as the  prejudice against healers like Snake, it never became exploitative. And it  was never dull.<br />The one character who could have been developed more was  the man who fell in love with Snake. It might have been nice to have him in  a few more scenes. Then again, I was glad this wasn't one of those books  where the heroine waits around for some guy to save her derriere. <br />Some  readers have complained that Snake is too capable and that most of the men  are painted as incompetent or evil. If you have limited tolerance for that  sort of thing ... chill out and read it anyway. Sheesh!<br />Anne M. Marble  Reviewer for All About Romance	2000-05-05

The hero and heroine's marriage is falling apart.  She is no longer the free spirit who liked making love in their cabin. She  now wants to go out to fancy parties -- but he doesn't want that at all.  Then, after an accident, she gets amnesia and returns to her old ways. The  hero falls in love with her again, but is was afraid she'd soon return to  her &quot;chi chi froo froo la-di-da&quot; ways. And he wonders why she  changed so much during their marriage.<br />While I liked the twist, I wasn't  crazy about the reason for the change. It made the heroine seem weak, and  at times, not very bright. Not to mention highlighting some communication  problems.<br />Still, making this novel start after the marriage has hit the  rocks makes it fresh and interesting. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could.	2000-05-05

There was also too much information fed to the reader at once. Eventually, the style improved, but I can't say the same for the main characters. They took too long to learn how to communicate. <br />The heroine  was inconsistent. She was strong and independent -- yet she had been  married to a verbally abusive husband for more than a decade.<br />Also, this  book alternated between &quot;funky humor&quot; and drama -- sometimes  melodrama. It was at its best when it portrayed the relationships between  Cloe and her old friends. It was at its worst when it portrayed the central  romance and the machinations of the evil cabal that controls the town.<br />I  gave this book a D+ at All About Romance.	2000-05-04

Freddie goes out of his way to treat Anne well. She was, after all, his  first love.<br />However, Anne has a secret. The child isn't hers -- but she  refuses to share this information with the people around her. She had good  reasons for not telling the local gossips the truth... but at the same  time, she should have told Freddie!<br />If you hate romances with overly cute  children, don't be afraid of this one.

You'd think he would've figured  out by now that he could trust her -- after all, he married her at the end  of the first book!<br />Oh, before I forget, this book also has violence, a  vomit scene, misunderstandings, and even a cat fight. There is plenty of  adventure, but it's lost amid the name calling, rapes, humiliation, and  foot-stomping.<br />I gave this book an F at All About Romance.	2000-05-03

Samantha and Lord Carew are very much like real people; when they make the wrong decision, you understand exactly what drives them to do so.<br />It also avoids the usual  cliches -- bestowing lots of surprises and twists on the reader  instead.<br />Fans of &quot;Dark Angel&quot; will be glad (?) to know that the  notorious Lionel Kersey makes a return appearance in this book.

Uhm, the characters, that's what. First, there are way too many suspects, and I had a hard time keeping track of  each character's secondary identity, which type of book they wrote,  personality, etc. As if that weren't enough, the main characters are caught  up in &quot;ye olde big misunderstanding loop.&quot;<br />The plot is full of  twists, turns, and surprises -- so there's lots of suspense, but  believability is sometimes at a premium. <br />I gave this book a C at All  About Romance.	2000-05-03

The author also showed wonderful mastery of suspense and a knack for great point of view.<br />Unfortunately, several things kept me from enjoying this novel. The excessive number of obnoxious secondary  characters; a tendency to melodrama; and illogical choices by the heroine.  For example, why did Summer distrust the hero without really knowing  him?<br />Another thing really bugged me. At times, it seems as if everyone  hates the heroine. She is the daughter of the secretary of state, yet  almost every public official seems to distrust her, simply because she's an  environmentalist! Gee, that's a professional attitude, guys.<br />Finally, the  characters like to lecture each other about the rain forest, politics, and  so forth. These people know about these things already, so there's no  reason for them to repeat these facts to each other.<br />I gave this book a  C- at All About Romance.	2000-05-03

The cloning science makes little sense. The heroine was supposed to be a skilled operative, but she was a klutz. And the action is often contrived.<br />This is one of those books where the humor comes from the supposedly capable heroine keeps bungling things, nearly getting people killed. The hero rolls his eyes and  grips, but puts up with it. If you like that sort of thing, you'll love  this book.<br />If you haven't read the earlier books in the series, you'll  have a lot of catching up to do. There is a lot of background necessary to  understanding this plot.<br />I didn't care much for the secondary characters  who showed up near the end of the book.

Yet something  completely unexpected happens -- she finds herself drawn to her sister's  fiance, Spens! (Though at first glance he seems like a stout merchant with  bad fashion sense, Spens is a great character.)<br />My biggest problem with  this book is the structure of the plot. Important information about the  past is withheld, and when the reader learns that information, we pretty  much figure out who did it. But I enjoyed this book so much that I didn't  mind.<br />I've heard Barbara Hambly's other fantasy books are even better.

Though I appreciated the experiment in form, this was off-putting for me.  <br />I felt that I never got to know the characters -- especially Leah, the  heroine.

Her heroines were strong, and capable of taking care of themselves. The heroine of Abbeygate holds her own, taking care of the master's children, even when there has been a murder.<br />This isn't one of those Gothics where the  heroine suspects the brooding master of murder even though there isn't a  shred of evidence. The master doesn't show up until after the murder, and  though he has secrets, he's far from brooding. (He is charming,  though!)<br />Cecily Crowe's &quot;Northwater&quot; was a better novel.

Nope. It would still be a good book, even if the character were based on, say, Mitch Miller.<br />Tim Wynne-Jones understands more about childhood and relationships than a lot of writers.

It was the secondary characters who spoiled  this read. When you have characters named Josh Cunning and Leach Muldavey,  you know you're in trouble. Most of the secondary characters are either  thoroughly evil, or horribly selish, or all of the above.

Not to mention subplots that fizzle out.<br />The only character I remember  strongly is the villain. He could have been a fun character, but he became  too eeeevil to be believed.

I think this book told me as much about Andrew Kazdin as it did about Glenn Gould. I recently read an article about Andrew Kazdin's technique in the recording studio. He likes to have control. But you see, so did Glenn Gould... I'm astounded that Kazdin and Gould were able to work together for  as many years as they did. And they did do great work together during those  years.<br />Still, go ahead and read this book, if you have a chance, because  it does have a lot of details and insight into Glenn Gould in the recording  studio.

She travels back in time, but she doesn't curl up in shock.  Instead, she bounces back. The hero is a rogue, but so much more than  that.<br />Both the characters have depths and backgrounds that are revealed  slowly. The secondary characters are a mixed bag.

Chloe Wingate can keep up with any hero. Even when she's frightened, she doesn't wimp out and depend on somebody  else to get her out of a jam.<br />Also, Elsie Lee wasn't afraid to deal with  controversial issues.

It holds up a lot better than romantic suspense by some of the veterans of the genre.<br />The plot moves along at a fast pace. There are a  few coincidences, but not so many that they spoil the read. The characters  also fit the story well. As an added attraction, the Key West scenes are  great.<br />My own quibble is that the villains are off stage so much of the  time. That's unavoidable with this type of plot, but it's usually not my  cup of tea. (I prefer stories about villains hidden within a close circle  of family or friends.) If you don't mind off-stage villains, you'll like  this even more than I did.<br />This book deserved its Golden Heart award. I  gave it a B at All About Romance.	2000-04-29

Rogan believes (wrongly, of course) that the heroine plotted to have him thrown into the dungeon. He kidnaps her, berates her, belittles her, forces her to toil at many jobs... <br />Lily puts up with so  much that I found her unbelievable. The Medieval era was not for wimps. She  could have been more strongly drawn.<br />The less said about the too evil to  be believed evil sister, the better. Why do the other characters never  figure out that they have evil incarnate in their household?<br />This writer  has potential. Overall, her writing style is smooth.

There were sword fights, wild escapes, corny villains -- it was fun.<br />Then, an evil, homicidal nun tried to rape the heroine. Hmmm. For some reason, the book lost me when that happened. Other violent acts added  to the &quot;Ick Factor&quot; quotient.<br />Also, the hero and heroine don't  meet until about two-thirds of the way through the story. And Salvador, who  has been true hero material throughout the book, suddenly becomes a  jealous, distrustful misogynist. Was it something in the water?	2000-04-29

The author deftly shows the differences between the Regency era and the modern era by the responses of her modern-day heroine and Regency-era hero. However, the miscommunications bewteen the Leah and David kept the book from getting a higher grade.<br />We get some  insight into David's character. But we didn't get to know Leah that well.  By the time we learned her background, it didn't jive with the way she  acted.<br />At All About Romance, I gave this book a C.	2000-04-29

I also liked reading about a hero who was an intelligent merchant instead of yet another  bloodthirsty knight.<br />However, the hero and heroine spent too much time  embroiled in communication problems. This kept me at a distance from the  story. Robert never even told Alyce about this failed first marriage!<br />I  gave this book a B- at All About Romance.	2000-04-29

The author has gumption for experimenting with a plot that covered several epochs.<br />However, her viewpoint experiment didn't work for me. The  heroine's scenes were told in first person, and everyone else's scenes were  told in third person. Wow, was this distracting!<br />Some of the plot twists  weren't surprising at all. Also, the villain was just too villainous to be  believed. Only briefly do we get to insight into his personality, and I  wanted more.<br />At All About Romance, I gave this book a C-.	2000-04-29

Southern atmosphere, a dysfunctional family, lots of secrets... Oh, yeah, and a hero suspected of being an insane killer. Now is that Gothic or what?<br />One thing that makes this stand apart from many  of the old Gothics is that the heroine is strong. She has to be to put up  with this family. Also, there are sensual love scenes.<br />My only regret was  that this wasn't one of Anne Stuart's longer romances. The mystery would  have been even stronger then.<br />I gave this a B+ review at All About  Romance.	2000-04-29

For example, it leads her to find a small plane in the woods. This plane had been missing for years. This discovery opens up a huge can of worms. Creepy goings-on  set the pace. My biggest gripe is that the climax is too melodramatic and  thus seems unsuited to the rest of the book.<br />Unlike many other romantic  suspense novel, the main characters of this novel actually meet and (gasp)  interact. However, Penelope's distrust of Wyatt went over the top at  times.<br />Penelope's cousin Harriett was a great character. I wish she would  get her own book.<br />I gave this book a B at All About Romance.	2000-04-29

It's gritty, sometimes violent. The heroine meets obstacles with incredible bravery. The novel honors family and faith, instead of glorifying gunfighters, and that's a wonderful change of pace.<br />At times, however, Samantha was too  good to be true. Instead of feeling angry with Caleb, which would've been  natural, she felt guilty for doubting him.<br />Also, I couldn't believe how  far Nathan had fallen from his faith. Sure, his experiences during the  Civil War would make anyone bitter, but I couldn't accept that he'd become  a sarcastic outlaw who smoked, drank, and robbed banks. He seemed too  intelligent to succumb to those things. His growth and redemption, however,  was very believable.<br />I gave this book a C at All About Romance.	2000-04-29

And one of the rudest heroes I have ever come across in a romance written in this decade. Omigod. He didn't just leap at conclusions, he pole-vaulted into  them.<br />Maggie is a soap opera actress. Her character is having fertility  problems. So somebody leaves a baby on her doorstep. I'm not into the  &quot;baby&quot; books Harlequin thinks we all love. But this one had  potential.<br />Then, Jared, the so-called hero, came along. He made all sorts  of assumptions about the heroine, based on the usual zilch evidence. She's  an actress, so she must be vain, shallow, and in it for the publicity. He  mocks her, makes baseless accusations, gets hits by feelings of jealousy he  can't quite understand. Oh, brother.<br />Jared's feelings about actresses are  later explained -- sort of. I wasn't satisified with the explanation. Also,  I was uncomfortable with the idea that this guy who hated show business was  a pediatrician who treated the children of performing artists. What a  professional attitude.<br />It should come as no surprise that I gave this a  D+ at All About Romance.	2000-04-29

If they did, I'd be reading westerns instead. <br />The science is terrible, and the  characters and plot are even worse. If you want to read good science  fiction, look somewhere else. And L. Ron Hubbard had the skill to make even  the most incredible action scenes boring.	1999-10-29

This is another of those &quot;Big Misunderstanding&quot; novels that Diana Palmer is so famous for. Some of those actually work. This isn't one  of those.<br />The heroine is a romance writer -- so the hero has already  decided she must be a Loose Woman. He treats her rudely and makes some of  the silliest assumptions I have ever seen in a romance novel. Even worse,  she never really defends herself until the book is almost over.<br />I used to  love this kind of book in the 1980s, but this one doesn't age well. Unless  you're a really big fan, I'd suggest that you look for another Palmer  instead. Or better yet, look for category romances by upcoming authors like  Jan Freed, Margaret Early, and so forth.	1999-07-30

I loved watching her help the &quot;misfit&quot; students make a better life for themselves. There was  also great conflict between the hero and the heroine because he thought she  was a student at first. This conflict was realistically portrayed. Great  secondary characters, too. The suspense element wasn't as strong as I had  expected, though, and that part of the plot was resolved too quickly.	1999-01-23

Boy, was I glad I brought this book to the beach. Out of a whole bag of  books in several genres, this was the best one I read during that time. I  loved the setting, which might be called &quot;drawing room fantasy.&quot;  The novel started out slowly, but the writing was so good that I didn't  care. And once the characters entered the caverns, there was no turning  back.<br />Most of all, I love the way Sean Russell doesn't fall into the old  cliche of the noble heroes fighting an evil dark wizard. The characters in  this book are ALL flawed. While probably you'll find yourself rooting for  Erasmus, you're never quite sure who the villain is. If there is a villain	1999-01-11
