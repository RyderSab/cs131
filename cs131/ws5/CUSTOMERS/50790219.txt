Let me start by addressing a misconception you may get from another review. Sokal, in his famous hoax, did not write \\"a bunch of nonsense and falsely attribute it to prominent French intellectuals\\". Indeed, much of it was not nonsense - to postmodernists - which is why it was snapped up by 'Social Text'. It appeared to touch all the right bases, with scientific bells on. Physical reality is at bottom a social and linguistic construct. Postmodern science has freed itself from dependence on objective truth. A truly liberatory mathematics is what we need. Etc, etc. The article starred in a special issue on the so-called 'Science Wars', and one editor refused to believe it was a parody even after Sokal said so.<br /><br />In itself that showed not much more than the tenuous intellectual grip of some cultural studies grandees. So Sokal and Bricmont followed up with this book. Their stated intention was far from producing a critique of the entire oeuvre of Lacan, Deleuze, Derrida and a dozen others, all between two covers:<br /><br />\\"We make no claim to analyse postmodernist thought in general; rather, our aim is to draw attention to the repeated abuse of concepts and terminology coming from mathematics and physics.\\"<br /><br />\\"We show that famous intellectuals such as Lacan, Kristeva, Irigaray, Baudrillard and Deleuze have repeatedly abused scientific concepts and terminology ... throwing around scientific jargon in front of their non-scientist readers without any regard for its relevance or even its meaning.\\"<br /><br />\\"There is nothing shameful in being ignorant of calculus or quantum mechanics. What we are criticizing is the pretension of some celebrated intellectuals to offer profound thoughts on complicated subjects which they understand, at best, at the level of popularizations.\\"<br /><br />That's what the authors say they will do in this book, and that's what they do. As for the hoax with its 219 references:<br /><br />\\"The parody was constructed around quotations from eminent French and American intellectuals ... the passages may be absurd or meaningless, but they are nonetheless authentic.\\"<br /><br />All this is spelt out carefully and at length in the Introduction, which a reviewer above seems to have missed.<br /><br />If you want to know what ruffled so many feathers, read the book. It's well researched and well written. But be warned that despite the authors' light touch, reams of inanity and bafflegab, which can give you a mild high at first, will eventually rot the brain. You never thought that E = Mc^2 was a sexed equation because it privileges the speed of light over other speeds that are vitally necessary to us? You haven't kept up with Irigaray. From Lacan we learn, along with much else, that the torus - a topological figure like a doughnut - is exactly the structure of the neurotic *and this torus really exists* (I know, I know, Lacan wasn't post-anything). Did we teach Einstein anything, asks the sociologist Latour? Er, no. This may be a French intellectual joke, or more likely it reflects a misreading of a popular introduction to relativity. I bet you didn't know that acceleration and deceleration are what physicists call positive and negative velocities. I have a Ph.D. in theoretical physics and I didn't know. But that's what Virilio, the philosopher of speed, tells his readers. And so on, and on. Several hundred errors, from the venial to whoppers, are documented and patiently explained in terms that non-specialists can understand. In addition, there is a long and sensible chapter on epistemic relativism, an extreme form of which fertilized the ground for this, and an interesting epilogue with suggestions on the way forward. The parody is reprinted with commentary in an appendix.<br /><br />Reactions to the book come in a variety of flavors:<br /><br />1. It's the wrong book. The authors should have written an in-depth appreciation of the philosophy of Deleuze.<br /><br />2. The errors are illusory. For example, Lacan was an M.D. so he was perfectly capable of mastering topology. If he said that the neurotic torus really exists, then it does. This has been seriously argued, and not just by Woody Allen.<br /><br />3. The errors are peripheral. They arise mainly in mathematics and physics where, unfairly, words and concepts are used with precise meanings, and rhetoric (usually) carries no weight. In feminist theory, continental philosophy and cultural studies, on the other hand, these thinkers can 'create concepts' with the best. In short, the vessel is leaking but only in parts where it is easy to detect; the rest is watertight.<br /><br />4. The errors are endemic. For a theory to be worth the name, it is not enough to have a repertoire of theoretical-sounding jargon, perhaps tricked out with mathematical decoration. There is a missing ingredient: reality (whatever you understand by that). If you believe that 'there is nothing outside the text' or that 'truth is determined by social convention', you have a problem. This is painfully apparent when soft practice blunders innocently or otherwise into hard science, but it is also, less obviously, present in all the other fields, with the possible exception of literary theory.<br /><br />Maybe Kuhn was right, at least as regards the humanities and social sciences, and it will take another generation for this paradigm to die out along with its practitioners. Meanwhile, what a waste: not for the practitioners but for students who are paying to have their brains addled.<br /><br />It's instructive to compare this book with Gross & Levitt's 'Higher Superstition', an earlier and more scathing attack on some of the same targets. Quote: \\"When such solecisms as we find in these writings are confidently put forth as scholarly discoveries, with every assurance that something profound is being uttered, one must wonder about the system - and the ideology - that nurtures and rewards them.\\" You won't find anything like that in Sokal & Bricmont but they caught most of the flak.

They were evil old Republicans, and back in Nixon's time they worked out how to clone people. Being Republicans they wanted to perfect the white American race. I think the idea was to create a WASP master-race and abolish welfare, possibly replacing it with slavery. They were even against gun control.<br /><br />Fast-forward twenty years. Here comes a six-foot young woman with big hair - a world-class tennis player as well as brilliant scientist, expert in psychology, genetics, computer science, you name it. Wow, this has to be Jolie McGillis. Her taste in underwear is lovingly described. Surprisingly she isn't a clone but she takes up with one, who happens to be nicely brought up. The rest are degenerate sadists, rapists and murderers. I told you they were WASPs.<br /><br />Now our girl finds out about the other clones, partly through being such a brilliant scientist but mostly by nearly getting laid by them. Naturally the evil GOP-men can't let any of this get out, especially as the aforesaid politician is about to run for the White House and has plans to rename Washington Berchtesgaden-on-the-Potomac. (I exaggerate - a little.) So we have toing and froing and cliff-hanging, 500 pages of it, until at last the bad guys get their comeuppance and the heroine fades into the sunset with her favorite clone.<br /><br />This is not exactly trash. Follett is a fluent writer and capable of better than that. He makes the pages turn as well as anyone and one or two of his characters are fairly memorable. (Aside: some reviewers seem to think he's American. He's British and a buddy of Tony Blair, which makes him a buddy-at-one-remove of ... ahem.) I suppose he intends us to take this story somewhat seriously, but I can't do it. I've seen more plausible scenarios on the back of cereal packets. Whether you think the pages are worth turning is up to you.	2005-07-18

If you haven't, it was made for you.<br /><br />Following a tip from his mole in the Vatican who hinted that the Virgin Mary was the Holy Grail and that knowledge of her earthly burial place had been suppressed by the Church, Mr Phillips headed to the Holy Land for one of his trademark hands-on investigations. His first discovery, on which all the rest hinges, is that Jesus was King Herod's grandson. The proof is as follows. Pilate asks Jesus (Synoptic Gospels, Good News version): \\"Are you the king of the Jews?\\" Jesus replies, \\"So you say.\\" Pilate pronounces, \\"I find no reason to condemn this man.\\" The Fourth Gospel has Jesus add, \\"My kingdom does not belong to this world.\\" What can this mean but that Jesus was Herod's grandson? This remarkable exegesis eluded everyone until Joseph Schreiber thought of it fifty years ago.<br /><br />After the Crucifixion, Mr Phillips discovered, Mary traveled with her younger son Joseph of Arimathea to Britain where they converted the Druids to Christianity. This explains why Nero ordered his legions to destroy the Druids a generation later, if indeed he did. Mr Phillips conducted another hands-on investigation and duly located the Virgin's grave in North Wales (if you don't know the area, about half the villages there are named after Mary). Unfortunately, he wasn't allowed to dig it up.<br /><br />Elsewhere he has related how he found the Holy Grail (not the Virgin Mary, another one), unearthed one of the tablets of the Ten Commandments, solved the mystery of the Plagues of Egypt, and revealed the true identities of Shakespeare, Robin Hood and King Arthur. If wishes were horses, any one of these would be a Derby winner. What next? \\"The Royal Scroll and the Royal Soul: Decoding the Violin Score of Old King Cole.\\" No, that wouldn't sell even to people who lap this sort of thing up. Would it?<br /><br />For what it is it's quite well done, apart from a rambling digression on 1st-5th century history which seems to belong in a different book, possibly \\"1066 and All That\\". 3 stars for entertainment value.rambling digression on 1st-5th century history which seems to belong in a different book, possibly \\"1066 and All That\\". 3 stars for entertainment value.	2005-05-10

In the first section, viz. the Old Testament, we are told that the ancient Israelites possessed a mysterious golden chest called the Ark of the Covenant which could wreak terrible destruction on the uncircumcised and sometimes even on the circumcised. The priest in charge had to wear protective gear, the mysterious Breastplate of Judgment, studded with twelve gemstones called the Stones of Fire. These, Ark and all disappear from the record before the 6th century BCE. Mr Phillips has discovered where they might possibly have been hidden: not far from Petra, 'the rose-red city half as old as time', which makes for some nice photographs. The treasures are not there now. They were quite possibly dug up by the mysterious Templars (who else) and brought to England in the 12th century.<br /><br />That's home ground for Mr Phillips, so he was soon on the trail. Mysterious lights were seen. Three stones were discovered which could possibly be Stones of Fire, and a slab which may conceivably be one of the tablets of the Ten Commandments. Mr Phillips discovered these in mysterious Warwickshire, after getting his hand in by discovering the Holy Grail in Shropshire and the Tomb of the Virgin Mary in Anglesey (see earlier books). Scientific tests were carried out. Mysteriously, they were inconclusive. This is the tale of how he did it, ably assisted by a couple of American semi-celebs. By a mysterious coincidence, this book was written for the US market.<br /><br />If you are put off because you think it's about boring old history or archaeology, don't be, because it isn't; any resemblance is purely accidental. This is a good example of a genre where reality segues effortlessly into fantasy and with one bound 'I wish' becomes 'it is!'. It is well done and naturally people love it. Some say it would make a great film. In the old days the movie would have starred Danny Kaye as the Pied Phillips, with an entranced throng skipping after him to never-never-land. Working title: 'Bulrush of the Lost Ark'. Mysteriously, I may have mistyped a word there.<br /><br />How has Graham Phillips managed to solve so many historical enigmas? (his website asks). I recommend reading an account of genuine biblical scholarship such as Finkelstein & Silberman's 'The Bible Unearthed'. Then, with luck, you'll be able to think of an answer.Some say it would make a great film.

After reading this book you may find yourself less confused, but other questions may occur to you, such as: why did French theory ring such a deafening dinner-bell in the soft underbelly of English-speaking academia? What became of old King Positivism and trusty Sir Karl? Were they slain by the false temptress Mamzelle la Key to Everything while the jester Incredulity to Metanarratives pulled faces, or are they only biding their time? Who knows?<br /><br />The book starts with a helpful sketch of advanced thinking in 60s and 70s Paris. Foucault looms large (he gets a whole chapter to himself later and very good it is, better than nitrazepam). We have a brief guided tour of structuralism, two schools of poststructuralism, six varieties of postmodernity/ism, semiotics of course, and neo-Marxist critical theory. This clarified several points for me, which is several more than trying to read the originals ever did. It may help you too.<br /><br />More than half the book is taken up with cautionary tales of theory-driven historiography. We hear from the semiotician Todorov on the downfall of the Aztecs, which was caused mainly by their shortcomings in semiotics; and Australian Paul Carter who, inspired by the unlikely duo Derrida and Einstein, pioneered 'spatial history' to replace (or retime) old-fashioned 'temporal history' ('A brilliant book': Susan Sontag). If that hit the spot, I can go one better: how about 'curved spacetime history'? Darn, Baudrillard already did it.<br /><br />Some readers deny that academic history is threatened by relativism and anti-realism to the extent that Windschuttle believes; or if so, that there is any harm in it. I was trained as a scientist not a philosopher, so forgive me for being blunt. Some people think they know the answers before they ask the questions. There is something of this in all of us but for three centuries or more it was seldom considered a scholarly virtue. In the new dispensation it is. Facts are now at best pale reflections of 'theory' - recent advances in philosophy blah-blah-blah, stir in the buzzwords, make obeisance to the cult idols, and the answer you first thought of is right (provided, of course, it's left). The general educated public is never going to swallow such foolery; it takes years of study. The trouble is that these people make so much noise they give the whole of the academy a bad name. Well folks, Sokal, Gross, Levitt, Windschuttle, even Kimball are academics, and some of them are left, but they are not out to lunch.<br /><br />Don't be put off, as I was for a time, by the catchpenny title. This is not a right-wing rant. The author has thought long and hard about his subject and is widely-read in and around it. He has read things that most of us would go a long way to avoid. Good for him. It's not all easy reading but it will give you food for thought.of us but for three centuries or more it was seldom considered a scholarly virtue. In the new dispensation it is.

Inuit snow (they don't have fifty words for it); Finnish swearing (they do); Japanese orthography (I didn't get that one) ... the list goes on. I'll tell you a real shocker: I knew a journalist, a graduate in English, who thought that the language he majored in and professed to write descended largely from Welsh (certain Celtic and Latin dialects spoken in Britain at the end of the Roman Empire). If that doesn't strike you as risible, you need to read this book. This is not a work of high scholarship but it isn't dumb (or dumm). It's a popular account by an enthusiastic amateur, written with his usual brio, and if it persuades more people to take an interest in their mother tongue, or, at a pinch, their native language, good on it and about time.<br /><br />If you want the full story, study Baugh & Cable's 'History of the English Language' and references there. Bryson's book is more fun, though. I recommend it along with Simeon Potter's 'Our Language', which covers much the same ground but without the swear words.<br /><br />I can pick nits too. In chapter 6 he gets the High German Sound-Shift back to front. In his version, 'water' ought to appear as 'wasser' in Dutch, Frisian and Plattdeutsch (this may be his Wasserloo). Also, he has a tendency to refer to the group in question, including English, as 'north Germanic', which is a big no-no to us nerds. Bottom line: read Potter as well.	2005-02-14

We have had a magnificent affair against Napoleon today ... it was my corps which principally gave battle and to which we owe the victory' - Prince William of Orange.<br /><br />As an English person of impeccable PCness, I wouldn't like it to be thought that we blame foreigners for a d@!n thing. So ... at Waterloo, which was a famous French victory, Wellington's Anglo-Irish scum ran away while the King's German Legion covered the retreat. The Iron Duke was suffering from gippy tummy or possibly piles. The Belgo-Dutch, on the other hand, stood and fought like heroes, and there was a flypast of pigs. Also, Sharpe is a fictional character, so I think we can all agree that he couldn't have winged the Prince of Orange or repulsed the Imperial Guard. Somebody did, though. Merde.<br /><br />There, Anonymous Reader, will that do? The book tells a different story but it's a good read. Not the very best - for that you'll have to go to 'Sharpe's Gold' or 'Sharpe's Regiment' - but if you like big battles, this is the big one, and nobody does it like Cornwell. Enjoy!<br /><br />Rather churlishly, Wellington chose not to call it the Battle of La Belle Alliance, although it couldn't have been won without Blucher. Not to mention the Prince of Orange.<br /><br />P.S. I owe an explanation for this flippant review. It was provoked by a certain 'reader' who reviews every Sharpe book as follows:<br />British feel-good book, typically British blaming the foreigners for everything, typically British boasting, etc, etc.<br />Boasting and blaming foreigners is, of course, unknown among French(?) people, especially anonymous ones.

For what it is - sword and sandals fantasy, not historical fiction, and there is a difference - this is great value. Much derring is done. Scarcely a swash is left unbuckled. If you liked 'Gladiator' you'll swear by this, and please refrain from going 'huh?' as noble patrician Julius Caesar works his way up from corporal, Octavian Augustus cameos as a street urchin years before he was born, and ... well, some of the fans may have trouble spelling Caesar but they know what they like. (If nothing about this tale strikes you as offbeat, I'd like to interest you in a valuable stake in the Pontifex Maximus.) The series so far doesn't come within ave distance of McCullough's 'Masters of Rome', but to be fair it doesn't aim to. This is history lite.<br /><br />No sooner have we met Corporal Caesar than he is captured by pirates, ransomed, and returns with a mob of heavies to demand his money back (don't say 'me too' at the back, this bit really happened). Pausing only to put down old King Mithridates of Pontus (who had plenty of practice at being put down but none of it against Caesar), he returns in triumph to Rome and makes the exalted rank of military tribune. After that there's some political stuff before it falls to young Julius to save the Republic from Kirk Douglas  (you've seen the movie - shocking, our hero didn't even get a bit part.) And there are two volumes to come.<br /><br />To take an analogy you may be familiar with, it's as if Bernard Cornwell depicted Sergeant Wellington winning the Battle of Trafalgar. I have no principled objection to this but I can't help asking: why? Don't let me put you off. Mr Iggulden is a fluent writer and some of the background verges on the authentic. There is an Afterword in which the author owns up to some of the liberties he takes with the story. I'm sure he knows what he's doing, but do all his readers? I'm looking forward to the episode where Caesar stabs Brutus for two-timing him with the Queen of Sheba.

When Michael Moore calls people 'stupid' he doesn't mean you or me, naturally. He means them (there's always a them). He taps into a deep vein of adolescent smart@$$ness which, with a little education, can provide a lifelong substitute for thinking.<br /><br />One effect of this book is to confirm the bien pensants of Europe in their conviction that Americans are stupid. They don't need telling, believe me, but they're always delighted to hear it. Deep down - well, not that deep in some cases - they feel that America had 9/11 coming for supporting the only functioning democracy in the Middle East, giving the Kyoto protocol the finger, and being stupidly American. Some have never forgiven America for the collapse of communism (needless to say, they're not the ones who lived under it); others are just out to a vegan lunch; but every last one of them loves Michael Moore. If it were not for Americans, mostly white, some not so stupid, this cozy continent would still be languishing under Hitlerism and/or Stalinism. Now, though, there's not much to occupy us apart from Islamo-fascist Armageddon, so Moore thinks it's a good time to get on with the really important business of bitching ad nauseam about the evil Bush. I don't know what effect that has on voters but it almost makes me want to root for the stiff. Except my auntie in Seattle would put out a contract on me.<br /><br />As always with Moore, it's hard to distinguish between truth, half-truth and untruth, assuming he knows the difference. But one thing comes over loud and clear: anyone Mikey disagrees with is stupid or evil. This is liberalism? Think before you answer. There is a rational case to be made for the left but this is the comic-book version, and while problems certainly exist, his solutions are non-solutions or, at best, solutions to non-problems. That may not bother you as long as he tells you what you want to hear.	2004-09-15

One reviewer starts by saying that he didn't read the book and doesn't plan to, and a bunch of people say that's 'helpful'. I guess it helped them preserve their fantasy world. You see, Michael Moore is a saint; future generations shall know how fortunate we are to have him; may those in heaven protect him - all quotes from fans. Another devotee has an Orwellian vision: 'President Moore ... producing documentaries and programs to help educate everyday Americans about their own political system.' Does this ring any bells? There is something going on here; those involved think it's liberalism but I very much doubt it.<br /><br /> For old-fashioned folk who like to read a book before passing an opinion, here's the story. Hardy & Clarke are NOT rabid right-wingers and almost certainly not in the pay of Bush, but they don't believe that Moore is a saint. They trace his rise from hard-scrabble beginnings in a middle-class suburb of Flint MI, via his days of horny-handed toil at GM (well, one day's toil, then he quit), his work at 'Mother Jones' (fired) followed by invaluable service to Ralph Nader (you guessed it), until at last he came into his own as a world-renowned maker of cool documentaries. Moore's habitual techniques - to put it politely, distortion, half-truths, spin and cheap wisecracks - are taken apart in some detail and shown for what they are (among other things, a breathtaking contempt for his viewers and readers). At this point the fans will shrill: 'But what about the issues?' There are two things to say to that. First, liberals cannot afford to glorify manipulation and lies, because without respect for truth liberalism is nothing, or else something completely different. Second, the only issue here is whether we can believe a word that Moore says.<br /><br /> The title, a ripoff from one of Moore's own, is probably a mistake; it doesn't do justice to the book. I don't believe that Moore is stupid in the ordinary sense and I don't think the authors do, but there are worse things than stupidity. Books that set out to demolish reputations can turn readers off, me included. In this case I make an exception. It couldn't happen to a more deserving figure.book.

According to the author's own source: \\"Once the FAA permitted overseas flights, the jet flew to Europe.\\" It wasn't a government freebie and it didn't take off until commercial flying resumed. Which leaves the bottom line: Mr Moore thinks the government should have done something. Maybe it should. Maybe the bin Ladens should have been sent to Guantanamo Bay. But that's a matter of opinion, not fact. In the old days liberals respected this little distinction; it was less confusing.<br /><br />Now I'm going to commit heresy. Many of his facts are like this: they strangely evaporate on closer inspection (take a look at [...] - there's Bush-baiting too). The author himself, backed into a corner over 'Columbine', has said that a humorist doesn't need to be factually accurate. Yet people undoubtedly take him seriously. A genius - fantastic - a new Voltaire! What is going on here? The trick seems to be to tell people what they want to hear, hammer it home with a ton of innuendo, and if you can persuade them they're being independent-minded so much the better. This may be showbiz but it isn't liberalism in any sense that Adlai Stevenson would have recognized. To be liberal you don't need to let your brains fall out. In fact you shouldn't. Personally I find it embarrassing, but a surprising number of readers think it's marvelous.<br /><br />There are those who think the civilized world is under attack from Dark Age Islamo-fascism. Mr Moore knows the truth, and the fans chant after him:<br /><br />\\"THERE ... IS ... NO ... TERRORIST ... THREAT!\\"<br /><br />- or if there is, it was got up by the Bush junta, the big corporations, the right-wing media, plain and fancy 'them'; anybody, in fact, except terrorists. One serial reviewer tells us that CNN was responsible. Whoever it was, they fooled the not-so-right-wing BBC and many others into taking it seriously. Maybe Kenya, New York, Bali and Madrid swung it. But back to the oracle:<br /><br />\\"Even in the tragic year 2001, your chance as an American of dying in an act of terrorism in this country was 1 in 100,000. You had a greater chance of dying from the flu or pneumonia ... from taking your own life ... from being a homicide victim, or riding in a car.\\"<br /><br />Let me point out the logic of this. Each year about 4 million Americans die. Only a tiny fraction of them are killed by the Cosa Nostra. This organization is not crazy. Why then does the US waste resources fighting organized crime? How - to borrow a clincher from the book - do you combat an abstract noun? If you can't answer that, as we are given to understand Mr Moore can't, stop now and hit the Not Helpful button.<br /><br />I'm not a fan so what do I know, but if I were, I would find one thing a touch disquieting. The new Voltaire appears to regard people as objects useful for polishing up his smart [...]. Consider what he had to say about the victims of 9/11. He inferred that they were mostly Democrat supporters - the terrorists should have targeted the mid-West instead. Funny or what?<br /><br />Barring the fascist coup that some of the fans are looking forward to, let's sum up his eschatology. Kerry beats Bush. Bin Laden says \\"Sorry guys, I got it wrong\\" and shuts up shop. The Iraqis spring Saddam and restore him as beloved leader. Americans get a 35-hour week just like the French. The hated tax cuts are repealed. It's possible there'sa grain of wheat in all this chaff - I wouldn't entirely rule it out - but if it's wheat you're after, go to genuine dirt-farmers like Woodward or Hersh. Okay, this is the funny pages and we're sophisticated people, no harm done. It's the ones who think it's 'fantastic' that bother me.

Being a simple foreigner like Pooh, and a scientist to boot, I don't. That hasn't bothered me much in the past, but now I'm not Saussure.<br /><br />The question is how much theoretical overkill the poor old bear can take. The answer is, while theory is its own justification and the printer ink holds out, the sky's the limit. A galaxy of thinkers is here to enlighten us courtesy of Prof. Crews: the Derridean, replete with deeply stunning insights and theoretical rigor verging on mortis; the neo-Marxist, living embodiment of Dr. Johnson's wise remark on hope and experience; the barking second-generation feminist; the Lacanian-Deleuzoguattarian (they won't lie down, you know); last but very far from least, the Vicar of Bray type, author of 'The Last Theory Book You'll Ever Need' and several sequels in the same vein.<br /><br />The footnotes - genuine quotations from distinguished theorists - should be studied with the attention they deserve. These are the guardians of the culture. Go on, give yourself a fright.<br /><br />For me the best-realized figure is the Roger Kimball clone, Dudley Cravat III, who by some extraordinary oversight has been invited to contribute to this panel. I suspect the author has most sympathy with, or anyway least antipathy to, this character, but that doesn't save him from a ribbing. \\"Much has changed, and all of it for the worse, since we ourself, nearing completion of our Harvard dissertation, attended the MLA convention of 1976 and discovered that once-abundant assistant professorships for tradition-minded young scholars had vanished overnight.\\"<br /><br />Many of these theories can be applied with equally gratifying success to subjects as diverse as anthropology, historiography, even literary criticism (not to mention fundamental physics, but that's another story). The names may change, the fads certainly, but forty years on this crew will still be transgressing importantly, if they haven't disappeared up their own discourse: Felicia Marronnez peering myopically at the world through the lenses of a new theory of everything (or nothing, depending on how you look at it); Carla Gulag fixated on some new Jameson and panting for the revolution; N. Mack Hobbs, America's highest-paid (and therefore indisputably best) humanities professor; and Dudley Cravat III harking back to a lost golden age when French theory with an American accent ruled the world.<br /><br />An acquired taste, perhaps, but an interesting and very clever concoction.e fads certainly, but forty years on this crew will still be transgressing importantly, if they haven't disappeared up their own discourse: Felicia Marronnez peering myopically at the world through the lenses of a new theory of everything (or nothing, depending on how you look at it); Carla Gulag fixated on some new Jameson and panting for the revolution; N.

Does it overturn our ideas on the origin and fate of the universe, or elucidate the deep foundations of mathematics? No, it's pomo. How many people would take this stuff seriously if it didn't sustain an academic job-creation program? Strange that a book calling itself 'Fifty Key Contemporary Thinkers' could be published near the end of the twentieth century and contain not a word about about Russell, Carnap, Popper or Wittgenstein. I suppose that, as advertised, this tells us something about our culture.<br /><br />Chomsky makes the grade, though under grave suspicion of rationality (he can't get his head round post-structuralist doubletalk, even fashionable relativism eludes him); also Freud and Nietzsche for their iconic status and power of myth-making; Saussure, too, of course. Then it's on with the chorus of important revolutionary intellectuals, who happen to be mostly French: Lacan, Deleuze, Derrida, Foucault, Kristeva, Lyotard, dozens of other Key Thinkers you never knew you needed. By this time, if higher education has left you with any critical faculty, you may be thinking: if these are the keys, where is the door?<br /><br />The book is not badly written by the standards of its subjects, and in a way this is an achievement, but the author's judgment is questionable. Elsewhere he thinks, for example, that Kristeva's early semiotics was marked by 'intricate rigor' - important intellectual-speak for bits of mathematical decoration stuck on at random. I have read it. Whatever it was, it did the trick; Kristeva has been an important intellectual ever since. If you want to find out about these people, this book is as good a starting point as any. The bad news is that you have to read some of the original works. Important lists of 'Major writings' and 'Further reading' are provided for that very purpose. But life is short; read 'Postmodern Pooh' by Frederick Crews instead. And if you find yourself starting to take the title of this book seriously, try and get out more.<br /><br />A good account, at the same level, of really key thinkers (sadly not all contemporary) is 'The Concise Encyclopedia of Western Philosophy and Philosophers', ed.

The nearest competitor is Byron & Fuller's \\"Mathematics of Classical and Quantum Physics\\" which has been around a long time and has many good points; but having used both I prefer this. The level and philosophy is about the same but the coverage is wider and the presentation clearer and cleaner. It's a pleasure to read.<br />The book is divided into eight parts, each comprising three or four chapters, on: Finite-dimensional Vector Spaces, Infinite-dimensional Vector Spaces, Complex Analysis, Differential Equations, Operators on Hilbert Spaces, Green's Functions, Groups and Manifolds, Lie Groups and Applications. Fear not: although it isn't designed for freshmen, it emphatically isn't the sort of math book where you have to crack the code to get any benefit.<br />The layout is excellent, there are many, many worked examples, and I found very few slips or typos. One black mark, the reason I don't give it 5 stars: although there are a massive 850 problems, there are no solutions (just like Byron & Fuller). Unless you're confident in your mathematical ability, you may find that a drawback for self-study. Finally, a word to the wise: check out this title at amazon.co.uk (provided you aren't in a hurry).	2003-09-12

Sadly, it doesn't. The author starts as he means to go on, framing his notion of God in such a way that pious Jews, Muslims and even many Christians would have to be called atheists. This may tell us something about the author but it tells us nothing about theism or atheism.<br /><br />He does seem to be widely-read. The level is about that of Reader's Digest, but not so rigorous. David Hume, who raised questions that philosophers are still working out, is summarized and dismissed in two pages; Kant gets four. The Foreword likens this to 'a college course on philosophy'. Reading it reminded me of nothing so much as a primer of philosophy I once came across by a Catholic priest of the old school, for whom all thinking since Aquinas was self-evidently wrong and pernicious. How did he know? Well, that's what he'd been taught in seminary. In a word, this author knows the answers before he asks the questions. If you also know the answers (and they're the same ones) you may find his approach congenial.<br /><br />The author seems to be a creationist of sorts; although, after devoting two chapters to this monumental non-problem and disparaging everyone from Darwin to the Leakeys, he never quite commits himself. The chapter on the modern argument from design is worth looking at if you haven't read those books with 'God' in the title by Paul Davies (who would certainly count as an atheist by this author's lights). Despite the blurb, the book has nothing but hair-splitting to contribute to the old conundrum of a loving, omnipotent God who tolerates natural evil, or the slightly less obvious stumbling-block of an omniscient God who is forever tinkering with his Creation. And the author thinks atheists have problems. It has to be possible to do better than this. I recommend the writings of John Polkinghorne, Cambridge Professor of Mathematical Physics turned Anglican priest (I think he qualifies as a theist), who recognizes a credibility gap when he sees one and credits others with the same integrity as himself.can priest (I think he qualifies as a theist), who recognizes a credibility gap when he sees one and credits others with the same integrity as himself.	2003-08-03

Could Joseph of Arimathea have been Jesus' yuppie kid brother? Was the Virgin Mary the Holy Grail, and is she/it buried somewhere in Britain? Were the Druids Christians?

Am I the Emperor Napoleon? My name has almost the same number of letters, I'm the same height give or take a foot, plus I've been to Corsica and Paris, so why not?<br /><br />As an example of a modern genre of pseudo-scholarship this book is rather well done. It contains some outright howlers when it strays into areas of actual historical knowledge, such as an idiosyncratic account of the early Church and some bizarre reflections on the Goths. Wisely, though, the author sticks mostly to gray areas where speculation is free. He's had plenty of practice and this is one of his best tales.

He could write vivid and engaging prose in naive style, but he resorted to prose only to introduce his volumes of verse.

Unkind readers might say this is a 1200-page exercise in ax-grinding; I prefer to call it a very long polemic. Nothing wrong with that, provided you understand what's going on. The spectacle is impressive if a little alarming, like watching an expert woodsman enthusiastically chopping up an ancient oak tree for firewood.<br /><br />It's true that Britishness is a working arrangement, not an organic growth (you can be naturalized British, but to be Scots, Welsh or English you have to be born that way). The author thinks the arrangement isn't working any more if it ever did; and he may be right. His book starts with the Stone Age and goes up to 1999. The main thrust is how Britishness has been invented and reinvented over the centuries to serve the interests of elites, who typically boil down to Anglos, and they wrote the histories. Revisionism on these lines has been attempted before but never so comprehensively or with such loving attention to detail. If you want to hear how Bad King Edward managed to beat William Wallace thanks to Welsh and Gascon mercenaries, but the English (minus the Welsh and Gascons) got their comeuppance at Bannockburn (\\"the flower of English chivalry perished\\"), Prof. Davies is your man. There's a lot more where that came from, most of it as interesting as it is one-sided. Coming to modern times, he thinks (in the 1st edition) that De Valera's Republicans won the Irish Civil War of 1922-23, which has annoyed Irish purists and Michael Collins fans who thought the Free-Staters won. Some readers have detected a cavalier attitude to social and economic issues, but they miss the point: that isn't part of the game plan. The really interesting question, though, is left hanging: why did the English, whose language and institutions went around the world, make such a botched job of cultural imperialism in their own backyard? Most of the Scots and Welsh (including Prof. Davies, in spades) are Anglophone, but they are not English. Why not?<br /><br />It isn't a silly question. Consider France, that grand cultural monolith. Who ever heard a murmur from the Bretons, historically as distinct from the French as the Welsh are from the English - where is the Breton Prof. Davies inveighing against 'Francocentric' history? (is there such a term or would it be tautologous?). Who but medievalists know or care about the Languedoc high culture destroyed by the North French invasion of the thirteenth century, and when will Hollywood be making an Albigensian \\"Braveheart\\"? La Grande Nation even acquired a German province in the seventeenth century, and when it was taken away in 1871 all France was outraged. Fortunately the injustice was put right later with a little help from the Anglo-Saxons.<br /><br />Time to fess up. As a native of the Isles who is not Welsh, Scottish or Irish, descended from more of the same not-persons from way back, I have to confess that I am, well, English.

For long-time fans like me who found \\"Sharpe's Prey\\" below par, I'm pleased to say that this one returns to first principles, frog-bashing in the Peninsula; and the author is back on form. If you wondered what happened to Sharpe, Harper & Co. after they joined forces on the retreat to Vigo (Sharpe's Rifles, Jan. 1809) and before Talavera (Sharpe's Eagle, July 1809), here's the answer. The Greenjackets are in the wilds of Portugal where the best Sharpe stories are set. Richard Sharpe is a disgruntled rifle lieutenant not long promoted from sergeant (not as unheard of in the British army as people think, especially when there was fighting to be done). Marshal Soult, 'Duke of Damnation' and aspiring King of Portugal, is closing in. Is all lost? Wait! an obscure sepoy general called Wellesley has landed at Lisbon ...<br /><br />I'll leave the plot there except to say that it's a ripping yarn (and I've been reading them for twenty years). We meet an upper-class villain fit to take on Sir Henry Simmerson; a beautiful, runaway heiress; and a young Portuguese officer of character and education who has a thing or two to learn from Sharpe. Deja vu? Well, some of the best vus are deja. There have been better ones than this but not many. The atmosphere is as thick as Dan Hagman's tea. There are passages of real sardonic humor, which comes as a relief after the last outing. The action sequences are many and unsurpassed. My only regret is that an old favorite, Sweet William the one-eyed architecture fancier, hasn't shown up yet.<br /><br />This isn't the best, but the time slots are filling up and Cornwell makes good use of them. Sharpe and Harper march again. What are you waiting for? And if you didn't understand any of the above, still read the book.	2003-04-17

Chesterton.)<br />I've known about this book a long time, and finally I've read it. It's the bible of the 'indirect approach': how to get the better of your enemy by heading purposefully in the opposite direction, and never, ever engaging his main force. After the horrors of the First World War, when the Western Allies engaged the enemy's main force for four solid years (one and a bit solid years for some) and didn't like it, this came as welcome news, and it made Liddell Hart's reputation as a military thinker.<br />A plausible case can be made for it: think of Sherman sweeping from hell to Dixie in 1864, or Patton (almost) running rings round the Germans in 1944. Spoilsports, on the other hand, including the theorist of mechanized warfare, Gen. J. F. C. Fuller, call it the strategy of evasion. They say that Sherman, Patton &amp; Co. were only able to stay in business because other poor saps were beating their heads against, guess what, the enemy's main force. Spare a thought, please, for Grant's boys 'fixing' Lee in Northern Virginia, the Russians tying down most of the German army in Belarus and Poland.<br />On with the story. In the Second Punic War, Hannibal, the undisputed champ of Punic perfidy (he outsmarted Romans!), had been ravaging Italy for a decade. P. Cornelius Scipio, brilliant and precocious young Roman contender, having read his Liddell Hart, opted to head for Spain, then North Africa via Sicily, finally knocking out Hannibal and his scratch force outside Carthage in 202 BC. He beat Hannibal and saved Rome; he qualifies as a Great Captain.<br />Most people who have read ancient history will know the outline. What I hadn't realized was just how remarkable Scipio was as a strategist, tactician, planner, diplomat and all-round achiever. Liddell Hart makes a strong case for his hero. I'm half persuaded that Scipio was 'greater than Napoleon', greater than Caesar and Alexander too, bearing in mind that these captains had more or less a free hand, while Scipio, as a loyal servant of the Republic, had to put up with suspicion and obstruction from his own government. He seems to have been an honorable fellow, too, which is more than you can say (oh dear) for some of the others. Just think, Roman emperors for seven centuries might have been called 'Scipios'; and instead of Kaiser Bill we'd have had Skippy Bill.<br />If you like the less-traveled roads of history and you don't mind Ciceronian prose, this book is for you. Equip yourself with a good historical atlas, though, because the maps are substandard. As for the strategy of indirect approach - who knows? Maybe we should hold the forthcoming invasion of Iraq in Syria, if only we can persuade the Iranians to attack Baghdad ...a free hand, while Scipio, as a loyal servant of the Republic, had to put up with suspicion and obstruction from his own government.

As an Englishman two generations later, I find that his writing strikes a deep chord. I agree in my bones with much of what he says and the way he says it; and when I don't, I can see the historical circumstances that produced it.<br />On the one hand, Orwell's life and work will command respect, admiration, affection (you don't have to be British). On the other hand, much of the political climate that formed it is ancient history. The kind of democratic socialism he stood for is gone, probably for ever; history took a different turn. The totalitarianisms of right and left that he fought against are gone too. It's hard to think back to a time when these were matters of life and death. But they were, once. If they ever are again, I hope that we find an honest faux-naif to insist that, when the clever talk is all said and done, night is not the same thing as day.<br />It isn't all politics: not much, in the tunnel-vision sense. Read his original critiques of writers as diverse as Dickens, Wells, Kipling, Yeats, Koestler, Henry Miller, Wodehouse. Read 'The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism and the English Genius'; 'The Art of Donald McGill', his appreciation of British seaside postcards; 'Politics and the English Language', which could stand reprinting in every issue of 'Social Text'; and many others, not least 'Thoughts on the Common Toad'.<br />The great and lasting thing about Orwell is that he was a tireless, clear-sighted, articulate enemy of 'humbug'. Feel free to substitute the stronger Anglo-Saxon word. One of his targets was that section of the intelligentsia, probably the majority in the thirties and forties, which went along with and even embraced Stalinism. There were reasons for that, of course - there always are - but Orwell saw through them; and he was a 'premature anti-Fascist' with the best. If he had lived as long as Wells or Shaw, he would have seen the triumph among the intelligentsia of our time of postmodern philosophico-literary theory, which, as we know, gives us the key to everything. At least it hasn't killed millions. What would Orwell have made of it?

Chomsky took what he needed from mathematics, while philosophers from Popper to David Albert pondered quantum physics and relativity. But, ignorant or contemptuous of the postmodern dispensation, they labored under a grave disadvantage. What they wrote took the form of rational propositions, and readers could test whether or not they agreed with them. The thinkers cited in this book are more advanced. Strictly speaking, they are impossible to refute. What they have to say is so deep that, where it impinges on one's small area of competence, naturally it has the appearance of nonsense, or at least lacks enough mundane sense to take issue with.<br /><br />Sokal and Bricmont's area of competence is physics and math, and they stick to it. They disentangle gross errors and more subtle confusions arising from a kind of cargo-cult approach to science practiced among the left-bank tribes. They detect an uncritical scientism that would have embarrassed Wells. ('It is not an analogy ... this torus really exists and it is exactly the structure of the neurotic' - Jacques Lacan.) They catch Deleuze and Guattari indulging in a prolix grope at the foundations of calculus, muddying the waters with mystifications that were out of date two centuries ago. But of course readers of philosophico-literary theory aren't expected to know that, and at a pinch the masters may be up to something completely different. And so it goes on, in the old, old style.<br /><br />The book is not a collection of finger-pointing schoolyard jibes. It's meticulously researched and a model of clear exposition. It raises serious points, which some speed-readers are determined to miss, about the current fault-lines of intellectual communication. It asks how we got here and what can be done, even essaying some answers. It's amazingly restrained (compare Gross & Levitt's 'Higher Superstition'), and all the stronger for that. The tone is drily humorous and there are downright funny bits: don't miss Irigaray quarreling with E=Mc^2 (it's sexist), or the sociologist Latour lecturing Einstein on elementary relativity. These people, we are told, are 'creating concepts'. They may be beyond parody but here's a good try: Sokal's Hoax, that concoction of pseudo-scholarship and pomo-babble, reprinted with commentary in an appendix. No, I don't believe the authors did it for the megabucks; it's the hegemony, stoopid.<br /><br />Does any of this matter? Are Sokal and Bricmont wasting trees? The best the critics can say is: they wish they'd shut up. One school of apologetics argues that this is all nit-picking and irrelevant to real pomo (they always knew these particular luminaries were full of merde). Another school insists that these, or some of them, or one of them (opinions differ) are great, maligned thinkers. They can't both be right; indeed they may both be wrong. By all means read Lacan, Latour, Deleuze and their Anglophone wannabes. Also read this book and some Popper, ideally 'The Open Society and its Enemies'.

Plato is hardly addressed at all; Hegel gets no more than a few passing mentions and a final cussing-out. If you want to see those icons comprehensively clasted, you'll have to go to Popper's \\"The Open Society and its Enemies\\". Stove, after a brisk opening fracas with the science history-philosophy brigade (headed by the ubiquitous Popper), directs his fire at targets who, from the point of view of an amateur of philosophy such as me, are of very minor interest: the later Nelson Goodman, Robert Nozick, then a whole necropolis of nineteenth-century British idealists. It came as a surprise to me that late nineteenth-century Anglophone philosophy was almost entirely dominated by neo-Hegelians. Well, back then my ancestors were mostly illiterate farm laborers. Quandoque dormitat Homerus. There's a lot more on these people (some of whom Stove humorously insists were first-rate, but wrong) than I ever wanted to know.<br />On the continental front, Foucault is noticed and promptly squashed. Derrida, Baudrillard, Deleuze - forget it. It's no secret that these have had more influence on the (loosely speaking) intelligentsia, for good or ill, than a hundred F.H. Bradleys or Nelson Goodmans. I suppose Stove takes it for granted that their productions are beneath contempt, even as examples of 'folly'; but try telling that to the fans. I don't believe this is the answer; it's part of the problem.<br />If you know Stove's work you'll find the old acuity and acerbic wit going strong. It's worth getting this book just for the final chapter, 'What is Wrong with Our Thoughts?' (forty philosophical ways to go mad). But the book as a whole would have been more effective with sharper target selection. I recommend his concentrated attack on the farrago of modern philosophy of science (titled in its latest incarnation \\"Scientific Irrationalism\\").<br />P.S. Many people wonder if Stove actually approved of anybody. He quite liked Hume. But even one of that master's apercus is dismissed here as 'tripe'!Stove actually approved of anybody.

Books	3	13	50	N	N	What is this thing called Philosophy of Science?	\\"Philosophy of science ... pointlessly scholastic activity which is liable to confuse the budding scientist\\" - Matthew Stewart, 'The Truth about Everything'.<br /><br />Once upon a time, the wisest men in the land turned their thoughts to the vexed question of how it is possible for farriers to shoe horses. Some said that you nail specially shaped lumps of iron on the extremities located at the four corners, and if one drops off you replace it with another, hopefully longer-lasting. But this was dismissed by almost all the wise men as too pedestrian for words.<br /><br />One of the wise men won fame by pointing out that there was a time when people got by without ever shoeing their horses. Those people, he said, would have been quite unable to perceive why the moderns put dead weights on their horses' hooves (even though, of course, they were just as smart as us). This was called the incomprehensibility of paranickels. It was received with jubilation throughout the land, especially by those who thought that shoeing horses was rather a vulgar business, tediously technical and probably involving difficult sums; now they knew the secret and didn't have to bother.<br /><br />Another wise man made his name by questioning how far the farriers could be said to be shoeing horses at all. Perhaps, he speculated, they and their customers only think that's what they're doing, or agree among themselves to say so. Anyway, nailing shoes to horses' heads ought to work just as well.<br /><br />The greatest influence on cultured folk came from radical thinkers who doubted whether there were such things as 'horses' and 'horseshoes'; or, if by chance there were, whether 'shoeing horses' might not be better termed 'horsing shoes'. This was agreed by one and all to be clever and humorous and (because it was written mostly in French) deep as well.<br /><br />By this time, since it was clear that a learned consensus on the farriers' art was nowhere in sight, it was suspected by some of the wise men, and by many who had caught snatches of the argument, that the farriers must be doing something wrong. This was called the epistemological crisis of the post-Enlightenment ferrous hegemony, and before long it was right-on wisdom in all the land. Simple country pomos would tell you about it at the drop of a hat. The farriers found this exasperating. One reportedly said that a philosophy of horse-shoeing is about as useful to farriers as ornithology is to birds. But he was a bongo-player and part-time Nobel laureate; that was just the kind of thing he said.<br /><br />As to this book, it is nicely written and provides a solid, readable if uninspired introduction to the current state of play. Many readers will find it useful for filling in the background, bringing the story up to date, and yielding quality material for cocktail-party conversations. It is best read in conjunction with the same author's 'Science and Its Fabrication'. Of course, you must also read the wise men's original works (don't worry, we're not talking Wittgenstein here).

It works very well - for my money the best thing he's done in recent years. The atmosphere is spot on, the plot is well worked out, character and dialog ring just right. It makes for a real page-turner, almost (but not quite) in the class of vintage Sharpe.<br />The leading character is a sort of upmarket Richard Sharpe: ex-Captain Rider Sandman, impoverished hero of the Peninsular War and Waterloo, a gentleman. Even the tough sidekick who gets co-opted after the usual teething troubles is a tad upmarket: an ex-Sergeant of the First (Grenadier) Guards. Their task is to re-investigate the murder of a beautiful Countess (former 'actress'), for which a hapless young fellow has been railroaded and is due to hang in a week. The trail leads from London low-life to the heights of society, and it's well worth following. I hope this is the start of a new series, although I don't quite see where it will go from here.<br />Two warnings: if you like big battles, or even small ones, sorry, this is different - there aren't any (for me that isn't essential even in Sharpe stories). And there's quite a lot of talk about cricket, but it's only incidental (think of it as a superior kind of baseball).	2002-05-01

Three and a half centuries ago, given the circumstances of the time, I would have been a Commonwealthsman, though nearer John Lilburne than Cromwell. So I'm open to persuasion that it might sometimes be worthwhile tearing up old constitutional arrangements in favor of shiny new ones. The French did it once a generation for the past two centuries, and look where it got them. Still, there might be something to be said for it.<br /><br />The survival of the British monarchy is an historical accident. Britain was never defeated in a European war, which is what induced the birth of most European republics. Nothing daunted, Prof. Haseler stands high in the ranks, all two dozen of them, pressing for a British Republic. He starts his book by observing - I paraphrase - that Monarchy is bad. This applies in particular to the supposedly house-trained British variety, which turns out to be responsible for the decline of the nation to a point where we have only the fourth largest economy in the world and a derisory international presence. On the other hand, a Republic is good. He reprises this in various keys, pointing out that there is no such thing as Englishness let alone Britishness, but not to worry, that will be no problem once we come into the EU apotheosis (what would God's Englishman or Freeborn John have said to that?). He goes on repeating it for 200 pages. He may be right; a centuries-old constitutional monarchy may be the worst system, except for all the others.<br /><br />Things have moved on since the book was written and parts of it now look quaint. He seems to think that the Diana cult, not yet crowned by martyrdom when he was writing, might provide the leverage that he wants against the monarchy. He's wrong; it's all part of the same thing. In truth the British polity has its problems but the monarchy is among the least of them (the exact opposite of 350 years ago). The moral is: if it ain't broke, don't write a book on how to fix it. Sorry if I sound flippant, but the republican movement, such as it is, will have to do better than this if it wants my vote.<br /><br />To the reviewer above: if people want to write books like this and other people want to read them, it isn't treasonable, you nincompoop. That's one of the things we fought about all those centuries ago.if I sound flippant, but the republican movement, such as it is, will have to do better than this if it wants my vote.

How, Stove persists in asking, could such a thing have been made 'acceptable to readers who would reject it out of hand if it were presented to them without equivocation?' Then he shows how, with Helps to Young Authors on how to denature language and sabotage logic 'after the manner of the best authorities'. This part is dedicated to George Orwell. Read it, and 'scare' quotes will never 'look' the 'same' again. The great and good were not amused. Sir Karl an irrationalist? The sainted Thomas an obfuscator? It's true Stove can be unfair, and many readers will think that not all four of his bogeymen - Popper, Kuhn, Lakatos and Feyerabend - are equally culpable. Nevertheless, they have more in common than you might think. According to Stove they have good reason, or rather unreason, to write that way. (But for a Popperian rejoinder, see the next review.)<br /><br />The second half of the book traces modern irrationalism back (insofar as it has an intellectual origin in the Anglo-Saxon tradition) to an unacknowledged premise of Hume's inductive skepticism. Whether that premise can bear the weight that rests on it is debatable. To follow the argument you won't need any great knowledge of analytic philosophy, but it may take some mental effort. Don't let that stop you; when Stove is being serious he's a master expositor. Far from being the Idiot's Guide to inductivism, this part is as demanding as anything in Kuhn or Feyerabend, only much better written. Remember, when you read some of the other reviews, that Stove treats Hume with the highest respect.<br /><br />Taking the book as a whole, it seems that readers either like it or loathe it. Apart from the obvious consideration that people don't like having their idols smashed, the probable reason is that Stove writes with too much clarity, wit and forthrightness for postmodern sensibilities. If you think, as some do, that the ponderous perverseness of Feyerabend's 'Against Method' is 'fun' and 'humorous', you won't appreciate this at all.<br /><br />Twenty years on, a kind of academic shanty-town sprawls on foundations of make-believe, for which at least some of Stove's 'four irrationalists' inspired the architecture and signed the building permit (they claimed later it was forged). To question the wisdom of this development is 'naive'; one must be 'half-educated' or 'an unwitting positivist' - witness reactions to Sokal & Bricmont's critique or the ecstatic praise still heaped on Kuhn's 'Structure'. (To be fair, some of the latter enthusiasts may not have understood the implications. One reader even persuades himself that Kuhn's ideas lend support to hard-core creationism. Kuhn is all things to all men.) Is it just a strangely persistent fad rooted in muddle, or a symptom of a deeper sickness?

Most answers to this question are either incomplete or incoherent. Physicists take the fact for granted. Movements that view quantum mechanics as a turning-point in thought - and that include fly-by-night mystics, prophets of a New Age, and relativists of all sorts - get aroused by the cultural component and forget predictions and technology.\\"<br /><br />What deeply untrendy, lab-coated person wrote that? None other than Paul Feyerabend in 1992. 'Against Method', the book that made his name, is dense, quirky and deliberately provocative, in parts a good read, but never intended to be taken as solemn holy writ. The joke is that some people do just that. Those who use the very technology he was talking about to propagate the latest fashions in radical relativism are like the lady who told Bertrand Russell that she had been a solipsist all her life and was disappointed not to have met anyone else of the same persuasion.<br /><br />Outside the madhouse there is a distinction between the context of discovery and the context of justification. Feyerabend's 'solid argument', based on the usual historical case-studies (Copernicus, Galileo etc.), applies at best to the context of discovery, which, as staid old Popper pointed out long ago, can be and often is anarchic. Feyerabend goes much further and asserts that the context of justification is anarchic too, or rather that the traditional epistemic distinction is illusory. This is the crucial step, after which, indeed, anything goes. As far as I can see he adduces no convincing argument for it. Why should he? If he's right - or if his assertion is right, which may be a different matter - then propaganda is as good as rational argument. Quite a lot of people believe this. If they tell you it's smart to blur the distinction, or insist that none can be defined, relax - you won't have to go to the local witch doctor next time you get a bad dose of flu, or call in a voodoo priest to fix your computer. Those smart people don't do that; they're not that sort of relativist.<br /><br />Cheap shot, I hear you say.

It's true that some of Tranter's vast output can be mildly diverting, if you don't mind historical and literary tone-deafness. His characters, whatever their names and titles, are unfortunately always the same: a small cast of modern people with modern attitudes, transported back five or ten centuries and endowed with an irritating repertoire of cod Olde English. (What of this of Master Tranter? Gey gordon it is, and, and, not so ill, just, all agreeing ...) I recall in one of his books an embassy to the court of Henry VII taking offence at being called Scotch instead of Scots. This would have been meaningless much before the twentieth century. It's a kind of unhistorical political correctness. Scott and Burns both called themselves Scotch; and Scotsmen unaffected by genteel Edinburgh preciosity still do. Other times he makes a big thing about how the Scots were more salt-of-the-earth than the English because they didn't call their kings 'Majesty'. Neither did the English, until Henry VIII picked it up from the French.<br />I like historical novels. There are some good ones among the dross, and a few very good ones. The best you can say for this book is that it isn't one of the worst. If you really like it - if you think it's something more than a written-by-numbers Cook's tour of the Scottish Dark Ages - there's no more to be said. Actually, Tranter wrote only one historical novel: \\"Balefire\\", set in the sixteenth-century Borders. I remember liking that when I read it aged thirteen. All the rest is repetition.

It concerns the British bombardment of Copenhagen in 1807, not to be confused with Nelson's more famous attack in 1801.

Apart from the odd eye-gouging and general mayhem, that's about it.<br /><br />There's a good description of Copenhagen being knocked flat, if you like that sort of thing. The plot is uninvolving; the dialog verges on the embarrassing. There's no trace of the gallows humor that lifts other Sharpe stories. I persevered because I'm a Sharpe fan from way back. If you haven't read one before, read and enjoy 'Sharpe's Gold', 'Sharpe's Enemy' or the picaresque masterpiece 'Sharpe's Regiment'. But leave this one until (much) later.	2002-01-16

He invented the term 'paradigm shift' to describe what happens when 'normal science' runs into 'anomalies' and enters a 'crisis', which in turn leads to a 'scientific revolution'. Nobody had heard of such things before, so Kuhn had a scoop. He sketched some historical examples in iconoclastic style; the result is this short book, first published forty years ago and still wowing Cultural Studies students today.<br /><br />Much of what Kuhn the historian of science says here is sensible and well taken. It has certainly been influential, perhaps in ways the author never intended, and should be read for that reason. But there are odd omissions. The greatest paradigm shift in physics since Newton - the adoption of fully-fledged quantum mechanics after 1925 - finds no significant place in this study. Eminent physicists, including Einstein, and even Schrodinger, one of its founders, regarded the new paradigm with deep distaste on aesthetic and philosophical grounds. Yet the methodology was adopted universally almost at once. What sociological factors, what structures of power and patronage brought this about? We are not told.<br /><br />It is when Kuhn puts on his philosopher-of-science hat and tells us about the 'incommensurability of paradigms' that we should question what he means, and more especially what some people have read into it. The idea is that Archimedes or Aristotle, encapsulated in their ancient world-view, would have been unable to see what Newton was getting at in his 'Principia'; and likewise Newton if you gave him a copy of Dirac's 'Quantum Mechanics'. This has been held to have implications for epistemology, viz: it is a mistake to think of the evolution of science (or any rational endeavor) as 'progress' in the sense of bringing us closer to an accurate picture of the world. Kuhn's position can be likened to Darwinian evolution: progress *from*, yes; progress *towards*, no. There is room here for fancy footwork. But the finer points are lost on some who simply cheer it as a poke in the eye for rationality.<br /><br />If an epochal break can be found anywhere in the history of science, it is in the transition from the Aristotelian to the modern world-view which took place in early modern times. Since then nothing remotely like it has happened. The training of physicists still begins with a detailed study of Newtonian mechanics, which for many purposes, from shooting pool to spaceflight, provides an entirely adequate description. An important part of learning relativity or quantum mechanics lies in understanding how they fit in with Newtonian physics - in fact, precisely how the paradigms are commensurable where their domains overlap. The same people at different times use the paradigm of Newton and the paradigms of Einstein and Bohr/Heisenberg. They don't use the paradigm of Aristotle or the New Age paradigm because - interesting though these are to the historian or the social scientist - they don't work; they are not fruitful for puzzle-solving, Kuhn would say.<br /><br />A process of generalization of paradigms has been characteristic of physics for the past few centuries, and this seems true of mature sciences generally. At the fundamental level a paradigm that has proven really useful is hardly ever scrapped (Kuhn cites two cases from physics since Newton: the recurring controversy over the nature of light - both sides seem to have won that one - and the caloric theory of heat). Instead, the old paradigm is subsumed into a more developed theory with a broader domain of application, yielding in some sense deeper insights. Kuhn the physicist knew this, of course, though some of his readers don't; so he had to defend the unusual position that e.g. Newtonian mechanics is fundamentally incompatible with Einsteinian mechanics, even though one is a limiting case of the other (Kuhndisputed this) and both are used successfully all the time. This was the only way he could maintain that they are 'incommensurable'.<br /><br />Where does this leave the incommensurability of paradigms? The concept can be interpreted according to taste along a spectrum: at one end, true but trivial; at the other end, deep but almost certainly false. Indeed - and I'm going to be shockingly naive here - you wouldn't be reading this otherwise; you'd be chipping flints. For what it's worth, my opinion is that Newton, far from 'living in a different world', would be perfectly at home with modern physics and raring to go, given a couple of years to get up to speed; Archimedes might take a little longer, while Aristotle would be a leading light at the Sorbonne.<br /><br />More problematic even than incommensurability of paradigms in Kuhn's work are occasional gnomic statements such as the following:<br /><br />\\"There is, I think, no theory-independent way to reconstruct phrases like 'really there'; the notion of a match between the ontology of a theory and its 'real' counterpart in nature now seems to me illusive in principle\\"<br /><br />and<br /><br />\\"Scientific knowledge, *like language*, is intrinsically the common property of a group *or else nothing at all*\\" (my italics).<br /><br />Taken with the thesis of the book (though Kuhn denied it) remarks like these open the door to all the baggage of so-called radical relativism. Now the baggage is in the hall and halfway up the stairs, as Gross & Levitt, Sokal & Bricmont and others have pointed out. Some of us wish it was out back in the hen-house.<br /><br />At the heart of modern physics there is indeed an incommensurability, in at least one of Kuhn's senses. It is between the two fundamental theories, general relativity and quantum mechanics. That doesn't stop people from using both paradigms, but it's a great puzzle: no one knows how to fit them together correctly. When we find out (strictly speaking I should say 'if'), it will be as a result of a paradigm that hasn't shifted since the seventeenth century: theoretical structure expressed in the language of mathematics, built on and feeding back into an empirical base. And there will be real, at present unimagined consequences.<br /><br />You may say that's naive or begs the ontological question. But I say it's the best we've got. No amount of self-regarding talk about hermeneutics and postmodern science - though it comes with a reference list as long as your arm to all the stars of critical 'theory' - will advance our understanding one iota.

US	50790219	R1115BTRSGFSYM	082471749X	287365442	Differential Geometry and Relativity Theory: An Introduction (Chapman & Hall/CRC Pure and Applied Mathematics)	Books	5	35	37	N	N	Highly recommended. Shame about the price	The first part of this book is a lucid introduction to classical differential geometry from the Frenet formulas to Riemannian manifolds, via Gauss curvature, metric coefficients, connections, geodesics and the curvature tensor, with many well-motivated examples and exercises. If you have a working knowledge of basic linear algebra and multivariable calculus you should have no trouble with any of this.<br />The remainder (two-thirds of the book) provides one of the most readable introductions to special and general relativity that I have ever come across. Because of the geometric approach, modest prerequisites and limited space, there is no treatment of relativistic mechanics, electrodynamics or the 'matter' field equations, and actually no formal development of tensor calculus. Within these constraints, it is amazing what the author does manage to cover. You will be led easily through the vacuum field equations, Schwarzschild solution, perihelion precession, light-bending ...<br />If this book had been twice the length - more comprehensive but in the same style - it could have been a classic. As it is, it does not seem to be anywhere near as widely used as it deserves to be .. Surely this is a prime candidate for a ..Dover edition? Until then, get it from the library.	2001-06-02
US	50790219	R19G5YD22C9NYF	0387986413	266735098	The Geometry of Spacetime: An Introduction to Special and General Relativity (Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics)	Books	2	29	42	N	N	Disappointing	I've only read the first third in detail, but so far this book is frankly disappointing. The treatment is lightweight and padded out with verbiage, some of it oddly off-key. What math or physics student at this level needs (for example) an elementary account of the properties of hyperbolic functions? Spacetime diagrams are drawn with the time axis horizontal, which is something I've never seen in any other relativity text. Okay, it's a minor point, but I found this and similar nonstandard usages a constant irritant. More seriously, the development of relativistic momentum and covariance in chap.3 is quite incoherent, and the definition of 4-velocity is WRONG (at least, by everyone else's standards - it isn't even a 4-vector). There are plenty of exercises, which is good, but no solutions at all - not even outlines - which is not so good.<br />The book takes over three hundred pages to get to general relativity (where there seems to be no mention of the equivalence principle!), and I doubt if it's worth the effort. You would do better to work through Foster &amp; Nightingale's 'Short Course in General Relativity', which is a first-rate and accessible introduction if you have a little background in special relativity. And it's two-thirds the price.<br />Conclusion: There may be a good book waiting to be written on these lines, but I'm sorry to say this isn't it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone as a first course in relativity.	2001-04-14
US	50790219	R1C9D1F2UFTW5K	0716723271	345550391	Spacetime Physics	Books	5	35	38	N	N	Not the Idiot's Guide to Relativity	Reading some of the reviews below, I'm reminded of a cartoon showing Moses parting the Red Sea. One Israelite is grumbling to another, \\"It's a bit damp in there, isn't it ....\\"<br /><br />I know the folksy style of this book can be off-putting to some. But if anyone thinks that the content is dumbed down, it can only mean they haven't scratched below the surface and discovered the extraordinary wealth of examples, insightful applications and programmed exercises. Taylor and Wheeler (John Wheeler, one of the outstanding theoreticians of our time) are attempting to acculturate students (ouch) to the counter-intuitive world of special relativity, set in the context of general relativity. That takes more than a collection of formulas given in a handout at the start of the semester. You don't need heavy math, but you do need much thoughtful pedagogy. They succeed brilliantly and, contrary to some opinions, do so without glossing over anything of importance. The only aspect of basic relativity not touched on is the covariant formulation of the electromagnetic field equations (I defy anyone to do that without a couple of years' calculus). In short, the book is far from trivial. It is accessible to any numerate high-school graduate able and willing to think. I can't imagine how it could have been done better.	2001-02-01
