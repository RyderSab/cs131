Some complain but they have to agree because they also read the book. It must be somewhat difficult after thirty five books to keep coming up with more but it seems Mr. Higgins sucessfully completes that mission. I for one will continue to read all that he writes, I have yet to find a bad one.	2005-10-07

From their start becoming surrigate brothers in a  orphanage through a life of professional assassin's to find that their father was having them terminated had to make Christmas an unhappy time.

This may be the nastiest of them all but the story line, twists and action are supreme. I do suggest the next should be called Repair Prey and have his Wife Weather do all her reconstructive surgery to all his scars from his previous injurys. All kidding aside the last fifty pages or so in the hospital shootout will be best read standing up as you will end up that way anyway. A great novel and will as always look forward to the next.	2005-09-25

This is my seventh novel by Mr. Deaver and they just continue to please. This one strongly views the black experience along with a cold case type sub plot of 150 years ago and a up to date line of terrorism. What a strong story is written here. At the point of everything being solved with over a hundred pages to go you may wonder whats going on? Well, read the novel and you will find out. I strongly recommend this book, you will truly enjoy it.	2005-09-20

Jeffery certainly did some dreaming to write this one interestingly spun around the world of magic. Never paying much attention to that world I found it very interesting to be reading a thriller along with a education into the study of illusions, sleight of hand and etc. Also a somewhat subplot runs through it with some militia running around in the hills and city well armed. All in all it was a great page turner with a lot of information not always readily available. I highly recommend this novel.	2005-09-12

Well forget that, its the best I've read in a long time. The description of The South and its characters equals the North's Lake Wobegon by Garrison Kellor. Waumbaugh's cops weren't as wacky as all the people in this novel. On top of everything it is nonfiction. Well, I finished it in a few days and would recommend it to all.

Mr. Flynn's research is exact. The characters interesting and his deep American feelings glow within each page of every novel. Our politicians should have this on their mandatory reading list, it may improve their thinking. In his final pages he shows exactly where we stand in this war, when we fight people living in caves wanting all to follow and live in the fifteenth century we have a real problem. The only thing they respect is total unfailing brute force. until we follow that line we will be there forever. Vince Flynn for President but he would have to continue his writing.

Her desire for truth is paramount. All she states on defense attorneys, Judges, and all the other grifters involved is factual, at least to what I have seen in my life. The poll taken  of Life in Prison only averages 6 years is astonishing. She is perfectly right in the fact of needing to inprison and not parole these monsters that molest and murder our children, we have to change the laws. The only thing I do feel she leaves out is that prosecutors in many states seem to work on a win/lose percentage that moves their careers forward. This with the arrival of DNA in Texas seems to have shown that some have put poor ignorant men on death row that were innocent but could not afford a competent lawyer. Lets take a good look at all of our judicial system and consider revamp, for the good of all citizens.	2005-08-09

It shows all the pain, grief, tears and empty stomachs that combat brings. It shows how fruitless the war was. Now we have Ford and GM plants running in the old combat zone and only some of us still feel the pain of an American blood soaked land where countless were wounded in body and in mind. But we can count the ones gone, all their names are listed on the wall. Many of us will always remember them, but our profiteers will only count the dollars earned not the men lost. I highly recommend this book.	2005-07-18

The death and destruction they had to live through was unthinkable and never again was America committed to a war that soldiers had to serve in duration plus six months. Mr. Jones certainly explains the feel to the battle of Guadalcanal and what was in soldiers minds. The novel is a study in depth of all feelings and thoughts placed upon the combatants. I would highly reccomend this novel to all that want a feel of WW2. I haven't read better.	2005-07-16

As we have all seen it lives in the Middle Ages and will never change as it is based on a book of law.  I find no problem in their freedom of belief, but for we in America to find any desire to follow it as a religion is beyond my understanding. Mr. Spencers explaination's were clear and concise. He spelled out all we in America have come to know as evil. In ending I certainly agree that they will continue their Jihad for our lifetime and probably longer. I only hope our children, grandchildren and beyond will stand up to their hatred and at least keep America all it has been in the past and is today.	2005-06-23

Dad worked in the Auto Shops and many of his stories were repeated by the Author. I remember as a teenager the next generation of the Detectives in this story. They were the Big Four. A black unmarked Buick with two giant Detectives and two a little smaller uniformed officers that never smiled. We still respected the law in those days. They made sure of it. The novel was teriffic with plenty of known landmarks and memories including streetcars. I highly recommend reading it.	2005-03-30

I have read all of his novels and with little patience await the unveiling of the next. Conspiracy has been denuded to a four letter word.We should realize it has become more than a infrequent event. I think there was a cover up and it quickly was denoted to a little mentioned item in the papers. For the betterment of the people I think someone decided against the truth. This seems to be frequent in todays world. It plays closely to the fact we do not see the planes going into the Towers on TV. Supposedly it is to much for the American people to accept, my goodness we may even have hatred for the criminals. Could we do that? Mr. DeMille crafted a fine story from two world events that have changed America forever.

I am glad it was my start. It clearly instructs where the Unions came from. It shows capitalism at its greediest. Socialism shines in those days but luckily the world found it didn't work. It was a wonderful novel except the last 35 or 40 pages which was only a speech of socialism which is now a moot point. I will read more of Mr. Sinclairs novels I hope I am as satisfied with the others as I was with the Jungle.	2004-11-26

I enjoyed the main plot, a little overloaded with 'street talk' but all in all the story line and tightness seemed pretty good but it lacked something for me.

Writing has been a twinkle in the back of my subconscious mind for eons.  Time finally arrived with retirement and writing has come forward into my life. This book not only inspires but instructs at a adult level. It is more than time management and with its bibliography to aim you at the next books to read it pays for itself. As a novice in the world of creative writing I would recommend this book to all.	2004-11-10

I found the information on China and their triads, gangsters, and tongs to be very informative. The book was well researched. All in all a great fiction story with a non fiction base. We can beleive today the real enemy will be China in the future. I hope not for many years.Best of all it shows how our country is not protecting us by allowing all the illegal immigrants and now talking of their rights. Fiction is a close brother of non fiction, actually Siamese twins. Read it and weep.	2004-09-24

The Marines are and always were the greatest fighting force in the world. For a person that never served they couldn't understand. We that have and did many years ago couldn't be more grateful and honored with these men. They are what our country doesn't like to say exists but what we know must.

Sadly, we may not understand our parents for years if ever. It is the lucky man that will grasp this grand plot of life.

Stephen King has the ability to amaze you from book to book and page to page. Who could have guessed the ending to this story? We have all been in a situation close to the main story line of this novel. From what was in the mind of our heroine to what was real was intermeshed to the point that everything was real. Then we come to the end. I had to set for ten minutes and relate to what I had just read in the past few days to thoughly understand my feelings. If you read another book be sure this is the one.

I understand the main plot came from a factual incident and certainly is a solid idea for a novel. Intertwined with the German and Scandanavian officials mostly Nazi's at the time there is enough fluff around the plot to keep you highly interested.

I love financial stories and this is a good one. Not only loaded with action,the stocks and funds running wild but a multi billion dollar family doing all the directing with all the dislike of one another that could be possible. The intriquing quirk within the story line of a hi-tech idea of mind control handled with CIA type influence also made this greatly to my likes.

Growing up during WW2 I remember everyone talking of James Dolittle and his raid. For some reason I had not read much on it over the years. I also found the crews and people envolved telling of their lives after the War.

You were for or against. We that stood for, were the patriots, those against we felt were traitors. After all these years I guess the only that could state who was right are gone but their names will allways remain with us on the wall of honor. This novel brought back all those thoughts to me. He wrote a novel that not only smelled and felt but was the way things were in those days. Anyone in education should attempt to make this novel a required reading in our high school's today. It is a explanation of anyone that has ever served in our armed forces what we beleive in. Anyone that never has must learn the Rangers important belief, we must all Charlie Mike.	2004-05-24

It also has the constitution at the end of the novelette and a preview of Alaska. All in all it could be said this was a writing for profit. I don't believe that to be fact. Looking deeply it tells a wonderful story of &quot;could have been&quot; based on true history.  The constitution is very good reading for all in our country. I am sad to say that most of our young people have never read it. This would be a stellar book for a high school history class, sadly I don't beleive the interest would be there not only from students but the faculty themselves. there are always the exceptions to all in life so we hope the percentage that do read and understand what our forefathers did we may have to do also. The story depicts the honor we must all have for our country.	2004-05-06

Some complain it is the same old thing. Others state many of the things are unbelievable, and etc. and etc on and on. Why  do they read it knowing it is fiction. Clive Cussler has well proven his ability to produce readable interesting stories. It is quick, interesting, and many times instructional. Behind all fiction is some fact and his real life in the seas surely substanciates that. Instead of total criticism to a wordsmith take a long look and see if you have the ability to better his writing. If so I strongly suggest you get on the word processor immediately and bang out something better. As I feel I will look forward to each book written and will enjoy his topics in the sense of happy action stories. Long live Dirk Pitt and all concerned.	2004-05-03

Above all Lee Childs writes a story that will cause you to delay interest in anything until consuming it to the last page quickly as possible. I have now read three of his offerings and will continue. His action and near fact fiction fill me with wonder and a grand appreciation for a eloquent writer.	2004-01-26

Written by a expert in communication. Each case brought you into the defense, you believe in the actions brought forward to give not only a legal defense by our constitution but to see a inocent person never is incarcerated,if that ever comes to pass. I would hope Mr. Black will write more, he is able to take a very complicated subject and break it down to a laymans understanding.	2004-01-18

This is the first I have read of Mr. Harwick's and will not be the last. He in few words discribes the city of Detroit and It's people. He has several twists and turns and his plot is tremendous. In all fiction I feel there is truth. This book certainly brackets my feelings.

I have never read a book that portrays that era in our history in better form. His writing on combat could only be written by experience. It also discribed the protesters in proper form. I  wonder as these people approach their waning years why they are not very quick to recall their years of student protest. The good and valored men were dying in those paddys. They sometimes admit it with some educated statement of how they were trying to help their poor brothers in Vietnam. The facts were well discribed in this book they were in most opinions traitors. anyone that served  would feel this way. Yes, there are 50,000 names of American Patriots on that wall, they gave all so the protesters have had a good life.This book should be mandatory in High School but would never be because the protesters are the academic leaders.

I enjoy a novel that is close to true history and Havana is. I was at Gtmo and stood that famous inspection by Castro when he came out of the hills after ousting Batesta. Seems he poisoned our water a few weeks after that. CIA will always remember that won't they.

Books	5	5	5	N	N	Heart rendering reality	The horror of Bataan and Corregidor coupled with the heroism and sacrifice at that time of history is almost beyond belief. Each man in himself was a rock of Gibraltar standing against all the tyranny of a nation gone wild. The Greatest Generation is not enough words to express what the men and women of WW2 gave to preserve freedom and our great country. This book is a work of fiction but tied closely with actual events;very close to Herman Wouk's Winds of War and War and Remembrance. It is actually a smaller capsule of the full picture. I plan to read all his books, I have found another great writer to add to my ever growing list of future readings.	2003-11-20

I Emailed Mr. Fish in regards to his stand and received back a razored reply and a disregard to Mr. Bennetts book and statements. Our country cannot survive without the complete patriotism that was in the past. The more we allow these denizens of America to cry and forgo all we have stood for in our past history the closer we come to the fall of our great country. The only thing I sincerly feel is after 9/11 we saw a lot of our young for the first time feeling the tear jerking, heart swelling pride that comes with being a American, this our so called intellectuals cannot pull away from our young. A great book and will continue to read more of Mr. Bennetts writings.	2003-11-08

The rich are not the flamboyant spenders,you will have to search for the quiet ones, they have the money and will always have it.Wealth is held, not thrown around like a football.One more tip; When you eleminate debt and stay out of it you are in todays world earning at least 8 to 18 percent per annum.

I was raised in Detroit Michigan, being the same age as Mr. Brokaw the book spoke perfectly of our upbringing. I believe that our strength as a nation was shown by all ages after 9/11. Those values came charging back though some of the younger ones didn't know exactly where they had arrived from. We elders know. As the youth now say &quot; We are all on the same page&quot;.

If you were on a street car and a lady got on and you were the youngest you would surrender your seat. it didn't matter if the lady was black or white. Then came the riots in the 60's and the flight to the suburbs, which we all made. It has remained. Whites and blacks have gone further and further out, some driving up to forty miles to work in Detroit. It is not as much a race thing as disrespect from black and whites in the city. There is not respect for the law, elderly or even themselves. In turn this is where all our large citys are failing.The drug dealers run the citys and it is in plain view. Ask anyone that lives in the City. Drugs are big money and it works its way up the line to the politicians.  Without law and order no one will return no matter what race they are. That is my opinion to the problem with the only answer I can see.	2003-10-01

In all wars kids go and men come back they that do, and try to fall back into civilian life but with great dismay many cannot. The feel of the country, parenthood, brotherhood and patriotism are all told exactly the way it was in those days. A crowning acheivement by a loving son. I read it in several segments and never once did I get through ten or twenty pages dry eyed. They were all heroes even if they would not accept it. The men of WW2  had to endure more that any of us did in the future, we can only be proud of them and as most have passed away let us always stand strong in the face of the world to protect our wonderful country in their honor.	2003-09-08

I found the book interesting but sometimes explaining that your reading of a person can be one way or the other and that you must watch for all traits and decide which is best.

From the beginning he had all the attributes of a fine young man. His home life,his friends,his grandfather he so loved were all that many children could only wish for. When is it that infectious germ burrows into the brain and begins its cancerous growth? Child killers,Rapist's,Serial Killers many times emerge from a very troubled past. When you observe McVeigh's idyllic childhood how can you understand how a horrendous crime would be committed by someone seeming to have all the attributes Americans pride themselves with. Was it the War that fertilized this germ of hatred? He was deeply touched by the first men that he killed as a combatant. All these things could have added up to create this demon that had been such a fine child and young man. I beleive this type of person was best described as by Bill Cosby regarding the senseless brutal slaying of his son. He was told that God sometimes call on us in strange ways.

Take a CIA type, throw in a few Malay's, some Chinese, a few brit's, a crossdressing Japanese,a fighting Doctor, inebriated a lot of the time and a Jade elephant and you have quite a story. The actual plot has to do with finding the bones of Emelia Earhart but what they find is much more than they thought. Read it you will enjoy it, I certainly did.	2003-02-13

The whole world was at war and courage prevailed. This is the first book I have read of Daniel Silva's, I will continue to read all of them.

A year or so has passed and I saw this book. I could not have been more pleased as I love fiction tied in with true history (i.e. Winds or War, War and Remembrance) I believe there was a attempt on FDR'S life during the war but thwarted.

Very confusing, plenty of action but no growth of new characters, as I finshed it I realized that Peter was still in pursuit, I couldn't tell that until the final sentence.

He writes with a style that readers can understand. Saying that. his plotting and style are spectacular as the new and old south sprinkled lightly as the first snow of winter. The characters become friends you have known for years but above all they are beleivable. The summons moves page by page toward a crecendo that shrewdly leaves you with a surprise ending.

Unlike some writers he managed to keep it to the understanding of most readers.  This offering causes thoughts of possibility after the horrors of September 11. My belief that fiction has a degree of fact in most novels,either personal experience or studied research confirm that. Saying all that, he has again written a wonderful story that leaves you thinking.	2001-11-01

All any of us could ever hope to be. A medal of honor winner and tough as nails, that is much tougher than any Grumleys that he has to face. All kidding aside I love all of Hunters smiper series and this was as good or better than any of them. I will stand by for his new one that is coming out this month. Happy reading to all.	2001-10-20

I have come to enjoy books written in this matter, I feel that fiction is largely based on fact but with some discreet changes. Mr. Jakes has shown the feelings of our people at the end of a bitter war, not only as a nation but a personal hurt that effected  every person left alive.  I sincerely hope this is not what we will have to live through in the coming years with the current war against terrorism.	2001-10-09

As I began I thought a book written by a General would be one sided.  I was really surprised, this book was written with all the fact that was there.  To look back and see just how the degeneration of the faith,pride,and backing of the American public to this non declared war can make you cry.  Many protesters should bow their heads and ask gods forgiveness for their actions during that period. may god bless each and every man that went and fought for his country, they were true patriots to the man. We should never forget them.	2001-09-28

Have been looking for someone as good as Stephen Hunter, well I have found him. Jack Reacher is all the things we look for in a macho action novel.

I have read most of his war novels and they all are fine offerings.  only one mistake, on page 243 the discription of D as dah dah dah is actually o not d. Only a Navy ex-radioman second class would have caught that and what would it matter with his rich discriptions of everything else.	2001-08-11

This monster did not rate in my opinion as one of the worst but he had his moments.  What will come of Weather's hope for Motherhood?, Guess we will have to wait for book thirteen of the series  to see.

The plot building to war was a very good one that would be possible, the positions taken by the countrys were beleiveable, and the ultimate conclussion was quite probable.  It was lengthy and the true action was in the last 300 pages, but the Jack Ryan &quot;John Wayne&quot; style was visable and made for a good read of fiction.	2001-07-08

Mr Cronkite is probably the most creditable newsman we have in America.  I applaud his book and his life.  His morals and way of life seem to be in the past but if anyone would follow his ways even in this day and age I believe they would be surprised to see the outcome. If this book acts as a inspiration to even one young person, I am sure it was worth the time and effort for its development. Here are wishes for a happy and fruitful retirement for a real gentleman.	2001-04-27

This emerald expressed greed as well as Micheal Douglas did in &quot;Wall Street&quot; with all its divested glory.  Nate O'Riley the drunk was brought around in true fashion to see the light of life and throw his addicted ways to the wind to lead a good life.

In it are all the interesting twists that you could wish for.  From J. Edgar Hoover, Nixon, the FBI, incest, love and the 1960's. Mr. Iles has outdone himself, he shows a sagacious understanding  of the era,and the principles involved in those days. Entwined in the story line is a well defined statement of not only race relations of that era , but what they have come to be some thirty years later.  A great book you will enjoy and remember.	2001-03-08

I find him to be a great author and holds not only the war,but America in context of the 60's.  There is no doubt to any of us that lived through that era that the war, the country, and our people were surely at risk. America as we knew it had to change and luckily it did.
