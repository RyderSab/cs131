Love leadership books and love and admire our special ops guys but this one didnt do it for me. Has good points but its one more attempt by someone, this time military, to make the leap to business and while there is some crossover I just find the examples when it comes to business pie in the sky. it will play with from General to CEO but the troops know better. And there are more special ops than the Air Force ... disappointing but if you like special ops stories they're okay but leave it out of business please at this level anyway	2005-10-07

The corporations I have worked in wouldnt get this book at all. There are some good nuggets occasionally but boy do you have to bear with it to find them. Another observation is that they seem to be out to solve world hunger so to speak. They dance around Taoism and Buddhism and never mention Christianity to any degree and that is what they are preaching if you ask me. To me this is another example of how leaders in America today are so disconnected they have no idea what is happening on the street ... does New Orleans ring a bell. Hello?	2005-09-19

He has overcome a lot in life and I guess that led him to be so egotistical but none the less he did it so he can say it. This book is well worth the read as it is inspiring and motivating and really gives you a sense of what it takes to perform at the level he does.

Great book on the life of a great General regardless of which side you're on. It isnt politically correct but it does take you inside the mind of the guy behind the victory in Vietnam.

Surprised the Author Didnt Stay	As a veteran of two tours in Nam, consecutive as a Marine Sniper I have read everything I can about the war to better understand it from both sides so this was one I grabbed when it came out. I have really mixed emotions. Larry is a veteran and had some horrid experiences no doubt. He wrote Paco's Story which I really liked. But in this book his love of the Vietnamese, which is fine, is so lavish, his praise for every single thing they do on his journey so sappy, all at the expense of everything America did or does, leaves me with a sour feeling in the least. He questions John McCains service as a POW, every single thing we, America did was wrong, every single thing the North Vietnamese did was wonderful ... its more than a bit much for me. He conveniently leaves out all the atrocities committed by the NVA and their leaders. I for one am not a fan of our leadership at the time for sure. But the extent to which the Author goes to make the NVA out to be the patriots of all time and then denigrates the 'lifers' and 'patriots' in our armed forces ... well, I am only surprised he hasnt moved his family over to Nam.	2005-09-05

The part on the young women brought together from Palestine, Israel and Bosnia was really eye opening. It moved my needle. As a former Marine Sniper a product of the Sixties with two tours in Vietnam I have to say this was well worth the read.

I was interested early and then found the essays saying the same thing over and over. Its a worthy topic for debate and we definitely need to move in a new direction out there as we can all see the ample examples of inadequate leadership but something was lacking in here.	2005-05-13

It is scary to think one person almost inadertantly can have this much power in our government and I am sure many others do as well and I lived in Texas at the time and didnt recall the guys name. I guess he flew under radar. Fascinating account of the beginnings of our present war in Iraq and Afghanistan and how once again our government made a deal with the devil and the boots on the ground for the CIA new it, told their superiors and well, as they say the rest is history. But if you want an outstanding read on politics out of control, bravery, treachery you cant beat this one and its true - no novel here. Great read.	2005-05-13

I love reading books from all perspectives and purchased this one with high hopes. It left me with the utmost respect for what Quang went through and especially his Father but it also left me confused about how he really felt. He loves America in one moment and hates it the next. He loves his Father one moment and is disgusted with him the next. He loves the Marine Corp one minute and despises it the next, I guess we all did that. He seems to have a penchant while I think true from his perspective to rewrite history for the ARVN. He is troubled as to why the US Govt didnt give his father and others like him a military pension for their service. The entire book is this way to the end and maybe that is the beauty of it is that Quang while coming to this country with his Mother and Sisters as a ten year old during the fall of Saigon doesnt know what he feels? He spends so much time on his Father that I was dissapointed to not learn more about the Mother who raised three kids coming to a country with no money didnt speak the language she gets him to UCLA he becomes a Marine pilot the two sisters apparently did well but he never mentions them and his Mom goes on to get a college degree and later served in the Peace Corp for the US and yet he is mad at is Aunt in Vietnam who he believes broke up his fathers marriage to his Mom at some point although Dad had a mistress and fathered another child out of wedlock. There is not doubt this is a real tragedy and we can learn a lot from it. I am sure what we see in Quang is as good as it got for many who were required to endure the losing end of the war as refugees. I was so disappointed I didnt learn more about the families struggles and didnt read more of a tribute to a Mom who did it all and not so much about the Dad who put them on a plane and stayed in Vietnam. I do hope the best for Quang and do hope writing this exorcised some demons. Worth reading, another perspective just not sure about it in the end.reading, another perspective just not sure about it in the end.	2005-05-13
