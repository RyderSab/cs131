He does this partly by recounting his own personal spiritual journey and partly by writing a gentle apologetic for why simply having &quot;sound teaching&quot; or &quot;correct doctrine&quot; isn't all there is to being a Christian.<BR> <BR>Using the classic evangelical cry of &quot;relationship with Christ&quot;, McGrath explains why this relationship rests in our hearts and in our every-day experience rather than in our heads. Then he goes further to help his readers by providing examples of different ways that Christians encounter Christ in both our lives and in our theology. <br />Although McGrath is a respected academic theologian, this book is not for academics but for the &quot;person in the pew&quot;. I found the chapters on the different ways of encountering Christ to be inspirational and worthy of meditation. One caveat: people averse to evangelical terminology might find this book slightly off-putting; most evangelicals should love it.	2002-12-12

That's the dramatic stuff and this book is well worth reading if you need to hear this particular form of Good News.<br />The more subtle stuff involves mistaking the fruits of the Christian life for salvation.  Another reader thought this was a simplistic feature of the book, but I think that (with the very best of intentions) many churches get conned by this subtle form of the anti-Gospel:  if you don't go to all the church meetings, you're not a real Christian; if you don't work on all the committees, you're not a real Christian;  if you don't speak in tongues, you're not a real Christian;  etc., etc.<br />This book does not constitute a witch-hunt for \\"cults\\".  The material is drawn from every-day situations, including the dramatic and almost incredible to the every-day sorts of situations we want to say \\"no\\" to and sometimes find difficult.	2002-05-17

It seems to me that he has two main points: 1) that a minister must first and foremost be grounded in a spirit-filled life through prayer and; 2) to achieve that, the minister must stay in one church throughout his or her whole ministry to really be rooted in the lives of people in the congregation.<br />He develops other points such as the idea that American culture wants the minister to be first and foremost a &quot;program director&quot; rather than a &quot;spiritual director&quot;.  He believes that the expectation of the church hierarchies as well as congregations is that ministers will whip up the action and make things happened as if they were PR executives rather than healers of souls.  In contrast, Peterson advocates a ministry of waiting and watching for the God who walks before all of us so that the minister does not interfere with the work of the Holy Spirit.<br />This book is written almost as a series of images, metaphors, stories and parables rather than as a propositional treatise, which is hardly surprising given the author's literary background.  While this allows the reader to make of some of the messages what he or she will, I found myself thinking &quot;I KNOW the church hierarchy will try to push me to be a glorified PR executive if I'm successful in candidating for the ministry, but what steps can one take to avoid that happening in the first place?&quot;  I don't think this book answers that question and I think it's one of the main questions he poses.  Perhaps we are to figure out the answer ourselves?...?	2001-08-17

Of all the books in the series, this one is probably the best general review.  It includes short personal and theological &quot;biographies&quot; of John and Charles Wesley, their mission to America and their return to the UK.  It also covers the religious and social aspects that caused the Methodists to split from the Anglican church and then takes the history of the Methodist church forward into the end of the 20th century.  The main aspects of &quot;Methodist theology&quot; are also covered in this book although separate books cover Methodist Theology, Methodist Spirituality and Twentieth Century Methodism in the UK.  These books are an easy read for educated church-goers and don't require any special theological knowledge.<br />Note that none of this series addresses the development of Methodism in America.	2001-05-10

In addition to the two week cycle, there are separate offices for saints' days and other special occasions.  <br />Each office contains the appropriate prayers as well as two Psalm readings per office and another inspirational reading from either the Old or New Testaments.  Following the Benedictine approach, the love of God is emphasised throughout the offices and places are indicated for silent refection using the &quot;lectio divina&quot; approach to meditation.<br />This book would probably not be adequate for an entire year's daily devotions, but it has several attributes that I like.  It is small and compact making it a perfect travel companion. Scripture readings are printed inside the book making the transport of a bible unnecessary.  All passages of scripture are in a modern, inclusive-language translation.<br />Finally, I would like to note that unlike some Catholic devotional books, I have found this one to be &quot;Protestant-friendly&quot; to this Methodist.  Outside of the offices for the feasts of Mary and the saints, the daily prayers do not include references to the saints.	2001-03-30

In some senses, that sentence sums up the book, in other senses, it does not.  <br />From the point of view of this amateur theologian, Holloway is simply expounding the best of modern Christian theology, albeit from a &quot;liberal Christian&quot; point of view.  However, I am well aware from personal experience that many people do not know that it is possible to be a Christian without (quoting Holloway) having &quot;...imposed upon them burdens of guilt and hypocrisy...and oppression.&quot;  If Holloway's own description resonates with you, then this is definitely a book you will want to read.<br />Subject matter covered includes:  the existence of God, the incarnation, biblical fundamentalism, human suffering, sex, marriage, divorce and homosexuality, Christian community, Christian ethics and the role of the church in today's world.  <br />Holloway is the former Anglican Bishop of Edinburgh and I believe (although am not entirely certain) that he has now returned to university lecturing in Theology.	2000-12-08

If I take this pile of bibles and increase it's number by 25%, how many bibles will I have afterwards?  What's that?  You say you need to know how many bibles I started out with?  That if you don't know the starting point, the meaning of the change is lost on you?<br />That's my main problem with this book which was set as part of the bibliography for the &quot;Liturgy &amp; Worship&quot; module of my theology BA.  The book is filled with historical and liturgical references that one has to have had prior knowledge of in order to read it profitably.  As an example, the section on the Eucharist makes reference to the fact that the Roman Eucharistic Prayer (EP) number 2 and EPs 1, 2 and 3 of the ASB derive from the same historic source.  Absent a library where one can access current and historic worship books and liturgies of all the major liturical traditions, this sort of passing reference makes the book quite hard reading.<br />The book traces the source of the liturgical movement back to the 16th century and rushes through references of liturgicists over four centuries without actually explaining their positions in one coherent manner such that the reader can say, for example &quot;Gueranger had these views.&quot;<br />I have no way of knowing whether this book would be profitable for experts or not.  In my opinion, it should not have been included on the bibliography of an introductory liturgical module without some prior background having been given.	2000-10-15

Susan J. White is Alberta H. and Harold L. Lunger Professor of Spiritual Resources and Disciplines at Brite Divinity School, Christian Texas University.  White writes from a &quot;small c&quot; catholic point of view whilst attempting to keep as wide a perspective as possible.<br />In a very clear and concise manner, White reviews the history and usage of various liturgical practices. The difference between traditions is discussed mainly where the practices have diverged or where similar actions are deemed to have different symbolic meanings in different traditions.  <br />A helpful introduction to the subject of liturgy.  The book does not seem to assume a lot of academic background to the subject although I came to it with a fairly wide experience of different liturgical traditions and found that background helpful.	2000-10-15

In between, however, Drane sneaks in some obvious, but mind-blowing theology into this book.<br />This is the first book I've read in a long time which takes what I view as a &quot;balanced&quot; view of what Christianity should be.  According to Drane, Christianity needs to keep preaching the pure gospel message whilst at the same time setting about to achieve social justice and helping the poor and the afflicted.  The traditional &quot;liberal&quot; emphasis on social works without the gospel isn't good enough. Neither is the traditional evangelical emphasis on personal salvation whilst ignoring the physical and practical needs of those who have no intention of ever becoming Christians.<br />Drane tries to get practical to a certain extent in this book.  He wants to provide the reader with a model of a process rather than with sample solutions.  This is because Drane does not believe that specific solutions from one church can be transferred wholesale from another church.  A church which meets the needs of the community needs to be flexible, empower everyone, and move away from the command-and-control structure of so much of the institutionalised church.  A highly recommended read!	2000-09-24

Topics covered include:  inspiration, historical  criticism, form criticism, redaction criticism, social-scientific  criticism, reader-response criticism, and post-modern criticism.

This book is  probably not for the general reader, but rather for those interested in the  experience of laywomen in the US Episcopal church.  It could also be useful  from the point of view of anyone interested in the subjective way that some  female congregants experience church community.<br />From the back cover, we  read that Gillespie is co-founder of the Episcopal Women's History Project  and Adjunct Professor of Church and Society at Bangor Theological Seminary  in Hanover, New Hampshire.  Gillespie was apparently given a grant to  interview women church-goers all over America and has tried to give a  flavour of these interviews by focusing on four different churches with  four different characters.<br />This book is interesting from the point of  view of (church-going) women's history and it is interesting from a  sociological point of view.  In that regard, the book is easy to read,  flows well and speaks of real women's experience -- and it seems that this  is what Gillespie was trying to achieve in writing it.	2000-09-09

Although this book is short, it is theologically and philosophically dense. It consolidates a life-time of reflection on the Love of God by a much-celebrated British writer and theologian who eschewed the life of academia for that of an urban (Anglican) parish priest.<br />It is extremely difficult to review this book in which one idea is chain-linked to the next. Broadly, Vanstone's reflection is that true love gives everything it has, to the point of being spent, while simultaneously allowing the object of it's love to be and become in complete freedom. And God, needless to say, is True Love.<br />I don't agree with everything Vanstone says; I have a hard time, for instance, of thinking of God being totally exhausted in the act of loving his creation. Nonetheless, what this book did for me was to answer the question: \\"Is it true that God actually cares and participates in our reality? And if the answer is yes, how does God do this without violating the free will of those God loves?\\" For me, the net result of reading this book has been to make both God and God's love more real and less ethereal. <br />The manner in which this message is brought home is, however, relentlessly intellectual. This is not a book to read for easy, uplifting inspiration, but rather for challenging intellectual inspiration.	2000-08-10

Although  I don't know who sponsored the series, I mention it because this book  starts out sounding a bit like it was written to order -- to someone else's  original agenda than the author's.  However, although the book reads quite  dryly at first, it is well worth persevering with it as Yancey hits his own  stride a bit later in the book.  <br />Knowing that Yancey is probably writing  for an evanglical audience, he is right on in reminding the church that it  should be there for the benefit of outsiders, not for the benefit of church  members.  He also reminds his readers that the church should be meeting  people's genuine needs whereever they are at and not simply trying to  &quot;convert sinners&quot; or &quot;win souls for Christ.&quot;<br />Yancey  goes on to outline a number of functions that the church can play in  society, given different social and spiritual needs in different  environments.  Whilst hardly a revelation theologically, this book serves  as a reminder, from one insider to another, of things that we as Christians  can do better in our coming together as church.	2000-08-10

He then proceeds  to outline his understanding of various Old Testament books and groups of  books:  Job, Deuteronomy, the Psalms, Ecclesiastes and The Prophets.   This  is not an academic work, nor is it really a meditative book.  It is a  highly readable work that I would suggest using as a bible study aid with  the goal of enriching one's spiritual life.  <br />Yancey never ceases to  amaze me with his spiritual insights -- especially given that I am a  self-styled &quot;liberal&quot; and he is a self-styled  &quot;evangelical.&quot;  This book is yet another very worthwhile read by  this truly excellent Christian author.	2000-07-27

This book was given to me by a friend who decided I had to read it.  This is the third book in Pratchett's  &quot;Discworld&quot; series.  I haven't read any of the others and it was  not necessary to do so in order to thoroughly enjoy this book.<br />In a  different reality from ours, where the world is a flat disc supported on  the back of a giant tortoise, lives a little girl named Esk who is  mistakenly appointed a wizard in a world where females can't be wizards  (it's against the lore).  Granny tries to raise Esk in the way of witches  instead, but finds she can't fight the fait accompli.  Like it or not, Esk  is meant to be a wizard.<br />The message of equal opportunity does not hit  the reader over the head, although the message was probably more blatant a  decade ago.  Esk needs to go to wizard university in order to control her  powers, but the university is just for males.  Granny, the prim  traditionalist, is against Esk doing all these &quot;unnatural&quot;  things, but turns out in the end to be the biggest &quot;feminist&quot; of  them all.<br />Along the way, there are fun, good humour, smiles, ethereal  monsters, flying books and orang-utan librarians.	2000-07-27

I have to confess, however, that I don't even really understand what the key message of this  book is.  I *think* that Bawer is trying to explore the anthropological,  social and political roots of fundamentalism.  However, the message that  comes across is garbled.<br />He makes one assertion that is just plain wrong  -- that Christian fundamentalism is almost exclusively a US phenemenon and  that there are few fundamentalists in Western Europe.  As a US citizen and  resident of the UK, I know this to be incorrect.  This makes me suspicious  of his other sociological assertions.  Oddly, Bawer provides bibliographic  references at the end of the book but rarely supplies any factual or  statistical support for particular assertions.  As a non-sociologist  myself, the scholarship seems sloppy and I'm astounded at the positive  reviews this book has received.  To top it off, the tone of the book is  bitter and depressing.	2000-07-27

This book is one man's interpretation of Christian theology from  one religious perspective. There is no historic treatment of subject matter  in this book. If you are religious, come from a Calvinist background, and  believe in a literal or semi-literal interpretation of the Bible, you may  find these short chapters to be good meditation tools. <br />If, as I did, you  expect to find a concise historic treatment of various approaches to  Christianity down through the ages, don't bother with this book.  The book  you want is Alister E. McGrath's &quot;Christian Theology, An  Introduction.&quot;<br />I especially object to the fact that people -- no  matter how academically distinguised -- are writing books which with  absolutely no citation of sources.  At the minimum, Packer does give  biblical citations -- if the reader is willing to believe that the writer  has the definitive view on Christian theology and truth.	2000-07-09

Much better than most of  the unsatisfying pap that gets published as tracts to help people &quot;get  saved.&quot;  This book answers genuine questions that rightly concern  people thinking about the Christian faith.<br />One comment on the theology  itself.  Boyd is not a fundamentalist, but he is an evangelical.  I  personally disagree with his presentation of substitutionary atonement (Why  did Jesus die?) and his views on hell.  However, as Boyd himself points out  to his father, these are but details in the scheme of salvation.	2000-05-16

Yancey -- praise the Lord! -- is one conservative Christian  who understands that Christianity is about God's love and forgiveness and  not about a wrathful, rule-enforcing God who forgives grudgingly.

The author (the wife of a minister) comes from  precisely this sort of background and addresses the biblical issues along  with spiritual issues and practical suggestions for how to get started.   Her faith shines through the pages of the and it's worth reading for its  uplifting qualities alone.	2000-04-20

Gilbert Bilezikian is a professor at Wheaton College and, as I understand it, one of the leading pro-female voices among conservative &quot;bible-believing&quot; Christians.  (&quot;Bible-believing&quot; is in  quotes because I dispute the implication of this phrase that  non-fundamentalists are not bible-believing.)<br />Your appreciation of this  book will almost undoubtedly rest first and foremost with the bias that you  bring with you.  If, like me, you were brought up in a fundamentalist  church and learnt your bible, and saw massive contradictions between what  the bible said and what the church interpreted it as saying, this is the  book for you.  How do the concepts of rulership-over and command leadership  square with Paul's statement that no one individual should take priority  over others in the church?  Why were there women preachers and teachers in  Paul's church if he was opposed to them?  Why did Paul tell women to be  quiet in one letter and then say &quot;there is neither male nor  female&quot; in another?  This book answers these questions and makes sense  of all these questions.  Quite apart from the issue of the role of women in  the church, the book is also a beautiful biblical exposition of how God  intends all human beings to live together in His name.<br />The book only  misses out on five stars because it could have been edited and laid out a  bit better.  Close to one-third of the book is footnotes, but the visual  lay-out of the entire book is poor and it's difficult to refer back to key  ideas easily.  Take good notes!	2000-04-16

Starting from the &quot;End Times&quot; and working backwards -- because this methodology  should allegedly make the theology of God's purpose and salvation (AKA  soteriology) clearer -- all Jensen manages to do is bore and confuse.  If  you know absolutely nothing about Christian doctrine whatsoever, this book  might be OK for a very quick precis.  However, it /is/ one man's own  theology with references, biblical and otherwise, mostly missing.  <br />Women  will be saddened to hear that Jensen also insists that we must call God by  a male personal pronoun and that we must neither seek God's feminine side  (God as Mother) nor must we remove the personal pronoun (Creator God).  As  far as I'm concerned, womankind can do without yet another Christian book  which seeks to invalidate one of the most basic parts of our identity.  <br />Bottom line, this book is tedious and sexist.  It is only the fact of  it's doctrinal orthodoxy which saves it from getting one star.  Readers who  want a *good* book on Christian theology by a conservative, orthodox  Christian should rather put up with the 560 pages of Alister E. McGrath's  &quot;Christian Theology, An Introduction.&quot;  This serves as a good  reference book, is heavily cited, and much more intellectually honest.	2000-04-15

Don't be fooled by the brevity of this book which is theologically dense and  probably worth reading more than once.<br />Do you believe in God's grace and  salvation by faith and sometimes find yourself in conflict with those who  would emphasise the Christian obligation to obey God's laws?  Do you  believe in the justice of God, his righteousness and wrath and sometimes  find yourself in conflict with those who emphasise salvation by faith, not  of works?  Carson describes six different ways that the bible describes  God's love and shows how these seemingly different concepts can be held in  productive &quot;tension&quot; within the Christian life	2000-03-18

As a recreational reader who wanted just that  sort of basic introduction, I have found this book has lived up to its  promise while also being easy to read.  Subjects are not all covered in  depth due to the material the book addresses.  However, extensive  bibliographies at the end of each chapter allow the reader to explore each  subject further.	2000-02-13

I agree that the materialist, the atheist and the strict fundamentalist will find much to dispute about this book.  The latter being said, Polkinghorne is actually far more orthodox in his theology than many modern  academic theologians.  For believing Christians who are uncomfortable  rejecting either orthodox science or orthodox Christianity, this book  provides many fascinating insights.  If you need to believe that God does  not exist or that he created the world in six 24-hour days, you won't be  happy with this book.  A final caveat.  The reading is challenging.   However, Polkinghorne provides a short glossary of scientific and  theological terms.  This book is more accessible to the general reader than  his most recent work &quot;Belief in God in an Age of Science.&quot;	1999-12-14
