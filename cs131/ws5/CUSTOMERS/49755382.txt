John W. Welch has assembled an impressive collection of original documents relating to six foundational topics in Mormon history: 1) the first vision; 2) the coming forth of The Book of Mormon; 3) the restoration of the priesthood; 4) Joseph Smith's lifetime visionary experiences; 5) the restoration of temple keys; and 6) succession in the presidency.   <br /> <br />In scope, this collection can only be compared with Dan Vogel's five volume collection of \\"Early Mormon Documents,\\" published between 1996 and 2003. However, unlike Vogel's comprehensive collection, Welch focuses almost exclusively upon firsthand and contemporaneous sources. This is refreshing, since the chief problem with Vogel's collection is that it casts its nets so wide as to include much material of dubious historical value.  I have found Vogel's collection to be very helpful, but have often lamented that much by way of hearsay and polemics has been presented side by side with firsthand contemporaneous documents of great historical value. To use a legal analogy, Welch's collection seems closer to what might be \\"admissible\\" evidence in a court of law, whereas Vogel's collection seeks to bring in a vast quantity of pure hearsay and speculation from \\"witnesses\\" far removed from the actual events of Church history. After all, how much weight should we accord to a hearsay statement only first recorded forty, fifty or sixty years after the actual events? <br /> <br />Welch has not only provided faithful transcriptions of the actual documents themselves, but insightful essays written on each of the six chief topics.  <br /> <br />While these essays are interesting, it is the documents themselves which arethe precious jewels of this book.  <br /> <br />I agree with Welch's insightful comment that \\"a generation from now, few people will care how various historians in our day have interpreted the past.  .   .  But the original documents convey testimonies that will always be of the utmost interest.\\" (From the Introduction).  <br /> <br />With these collections by Vogel and now Welch, in hand, the day should be long past in studies of Church history, when any  reader possessed of reasonable intelligence should put much further credence in the rarified theories of professional historians. Few academic writers have ever been honest enough to \\"proclaim their malefactions\\" - their personal bias - in their writing, pretending, instead that their work is \\"scientific.\\" What many historical writers - both apologists and critics - fail to admit is that, \\"A fact is a fact\\", until you begin to string two or more facts together. Then it becomes a work of the imagination and not a science.  <br /> <br />I have a few additional comments, criticisms and disappointments regarding this collection, as follows: <br /> <br />1. The best commentary in this set, by far, is that which precedes the collection of documents relating to the first vision. The excellent essay by Dean Jesse, and especially the one by James B. Allen and Welch himself, far exceed the others in clarity. Joseph Smith's ten accounts of the first vision, contained in thirteen documents, are then presented chronologically. Welch and Allen use the very helpful tool of providing charts summarizing the contents of each of the ten accounts. <br /> <br />2. Welch's collection of documents on the coming forth of the Book of Mormon is of almost equal clarity and quality to the collection on the first vision. <br /> <br />3. While the collection of priesthood restoration documents edited by Brian Q. Cannon is well presented, Cannon's commentary itself leaves something to be desired. I felt as if his writing lacks the clarity found in the previous essays of Jesse, Allen and Welch.  <br /> <br />4. Most disappointing in this collection is the essay and collection by Alexander L. Baugh. In fact, there really isn't a collection of documents here, but only chronology and summary of seventy-six \\"visionary experiences\\" received by the Prophet during his lifetime. Why weren't the documents themselves published here? The chronology prepared by Baugh is helpful, but I want to see the documents, not merely Baugh's rather pedestrian essay. <br /> <br />5. The documents and essay regarding \\"Succession in the Presidency\\" are also disappointing, in that they focus solely upon the \\"mantle of the prophet\\" experience of 1844, and not upon other key events, such as the \\"rolling off of the keys\\"  upon the Twelve or the additional authority conferred upon the Twelve in conjunction with the restoration of temple keys and the activities of the \\"quorum of the anointed\\" in Nauvoo from 1842 to 1844, etc. <br /> <br />6. Even with its several problems and disappointments, after a first reading I tend to agree with John Welch's initial suggestion that this \\"may be one of the most important LDS Church history books you will ever read.\\"   <br /> <br />Excellent book well worthy of the highest recommendation! <br />	2005-03-31

Probably no one. But the point is, that these lectures are still fresh and compelling after more than half a century.<br /><br />Nibley's emphasis in the first part of this work is upon the distinct and separate nature of the offices of Apostle and Bishop in the primitive Christian Church. Catholics, of course, claim that Peter was the first bishop of Rome, while Orthodox Christians claim he was the first bishop of Antioch. Nibley traces the complex and tortuous history of the office of bishop in the early church, and the contemporaneous disappearance of the office of apostle. The second part of the book presents a history of the office of bishop in the Church in Rome, and the subsequent rise of the papacy.<br /><br />Some additional thoughts:<br /><br />1. Though published by FARMS, this is not a work of Mormon apologia per se. Indeed, the works of Joseph Smith are not even mentioned in the text. The bottom line is that this is a scholarly and detailed treatise on the question of Catholic papal authority.<br /><br />2. The manuscript for this book was apparently rescued from a mass of Nibley's papers, and the original lacked any references for the footnotes. Nibley provided a mass of quoted material in the manuscript without references. FARMS has undertaken the Herculean task of finding the sources for the quoted materials, and has succeeded in doing so in probably ninety five percent of the cases. The original quotations were translated by Nibley himself from the original Greek, Latin, Medieval Latin, German, French, etc. From those quoted languages I can read, it appears that Nibley's translations are precise and well rendered. Those critics of Hugh Nibley, who have alleged that he makes up ninety percent of his footnotes, ought to examine the footnotes in this work carefully. It is truly eye opening.<br /><br />3.This book, fifteenth in the series of Nibley's complete works being published by FARMS, whets the appetite for the long awaited magnum opus, One Eternal Round, which is finally out of the hands of the old sloven and with the editors.<br /><br />4.  On a personal note, I purchased this book the day after Nibley's death, and read it in the succeeding week as a benediction of sorts to the memory of a great and treasured mentor.	2005-03-05

I stress, however, \\"introduction,\\" as no fictional work can begin to address the myriad pieces of this most beautiful, terrible and vexing puzzle.<br />Andric's tale, covering the life of multiple generations in a small city in eastern Bosnia, centers on the Ottoman bridge constructed in the center of town.  Its high spans look down on the swirling waters of the Drina River, and at its center is a ballustrade-lined platform called a capia, which becomes the center of town life for centuries.  Andric's lyrical prose is nothing short of magnificent, even in translation.  His multitude of characters are insightfully and skillfully drawn.  And ever the narrative returns to the bridge.  In effect the novel is something akin to both Tolstoy and Michener, with a rich ironical voice reminiscent of the best Latin American writers.<br />A word of caution, however.  If you come to the novel seeking a definitive cause or motive for the Bosnian War, or the heartbreaking tragedies of the Balkans generally, present or past, you will come away misguided.  Andric is merely the voice of one witness from one perspective.  An understanding of the complexity of the the Balkans requires more than one voice, but rather a knowledge of Greek, Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman, Hapsburg, German, Italian and Russian history;  an understanding of Islam, Judaism, and the Roman and Orthodox Churches; and from a careful hearing of a multitude of other \\"voices.\\"	2003-01-28

This is the fascinating story of Professor James Murray, the illustrious editor of the OED and one of his most prolific contributors, Dr. W.C. Minor, an American born surgeon committed to England's Broadmoor insane asylum. Reading more like a novel than a piece of historical research, Winchester's book is highly accessible to the non-specialist and can be read in one sitting. This is a meaty and nourishing little vignette of history. <br />Some additional thoughts:<br />1. Winchester is one of those rare journalists with a knack for historical writing and story telling. Like I.F. Stone (The Trial of Socrates), his work has none of the hackneyed earmarks of the work of most newspapermen but shows glimmers of true scholarship and insightful analysis. Winchester is the History Professor I wish I had had as an undergraduate.<br />2. In recent years there has arisen almost a separate genre of popular non-fiction which focuses on the forgotten and unexplored nooks and corners of history. These are among the books I have stacked on my desk to be read as casual diversions from more serious reading. Miniature portraits rather than vast landscapes. Among these are such entertaining fare as Beethoven's Hair by Russell Martin, Nathaniel's Nutmeg by Giles Milton and The Potato: How the Humble Spud Rescued the Western World by Larry Zuckerman. The Professor and the Madman is the best of this entertaining little genre. <br />3. Winchester's writing stands head and shoulders above the crowd. I wish he would try his hand at something more sweeping, like Thomas Cahill has done in his Hinges of History series.	2002-09-05

The book is absolutely bristling with textual elucidations, notes and marginalia and a stunningly detailed, if somewhat dry, introduction. Moreover, no other edition I have used (and I have read Hamlet more than fifty times since the summer of my seventeenth year, including this edition over two enriching days during the past week) so clearly lays out the textual divergencies of  the various versions of the canon, Q1, Q2 and F, as does Arden.<br />Than being said, it is the text itself which shines through in this (and any other) edition --  let us not mistake the husk for the grain.  <br />Hamlet (as Harold Bloom argues so persuasively) more than any other play is surely Shakespeare's life work -- a work which he poured more of himself into over a longer period of time than any other.  Written in its final version just months after the death of the playwright's only son, Hamnet, and his father, it represents Shakespeare's personal triumph over adversity and darkness.	2002-07-14

Hinckley has observed that Elder Neal A. Maxwell &quot;speaks differently from any of the other General Authorities.&quot;  This is a significant understatement.  Probably no other latter-day saint speaker or writer of the past century has such a unique voice.  Elder Maxwell's sermons and writings could never be mistaken as coming from the mouth or pen of any other person.  <br />This is a richly told life of a complex and many faceted man.  Bruce Hafen's work has both breadth and depth.  The book is amazingly detailed, but also contains deep insight.  This will surely stand as the definitive work on Elder Maxwell's life.<br />Some additional thoughts:<br />1.   Many readers will discover here for the first time the amazing variety of Elder Maxwell's activities.  Writer, Administrator, Political Activist and Athlete -- here is surely a true Renaissance Man.<br />2.   If this biography has a theme, it is Elder Maxwell's triumph over the cancer that beset him in the mid 1990's -- a personal Odessey from which he emerged with powerful new richness and depth of thought.<br />3.   One is struck upon reading this book that Elder Maxwell's path to the leading councils of the Church is one of the most unique things about him.  Aside from serving briefly as a bishop of a student ward as a fairly young man, Elder Maxwell had virtually no ecclesiastical leadership experience when in a bold and startling move he was &quot;plucked&quot;, as it were, by the First Presidency to head up a dramatically revamped LDS education system.	2002-07-14

Here he has no contemporary peer in the field.  Beside him the many other interpreters of the record are merely clerks filling up pigeonholes.  Among the few rivals of Quinn's stupendous grasp of this very large subject is B.H. Roberts, running large and grim ahead of the field.<br />Quinn's weakness -- and this is also a very considerable weakness -- is his dark and sometimes bland analysis of the data. His works on J. Reuben Clark are the chief exhibit of this failing.  He lacks the power to persuade and enlighten. He is a plodder, not a baton-carrier.  Other thoughts:<br />1.  Am I just imagining it, or do I detect a dark undertone of subtle challenge to the historicity of Joseph Smith's revelations.  I take with a grain of salt the words of an unabashed apologist, but am even more skeptical of a man who fails to proclaim his malefactions.  Quinn is an excommunicated Mormon.  If he writes with love or hate for his subject, he ought to lay it out frankly.  If there is an axe to grind, I want to see the sparks fly.<br />2.   By far the most interesting and valuable section of this book -- and its equally prodigous companion volume -- is the chronology given in one of the appendices.  This is a veritable goldmine of fascinating and obscure detail.	2002-07-11

What a pleasure to see him return home to his native subject and first love -- Shakespeare.  Some random impressions:<br />1.  Bloom's real value is in leading the reader to return to the plays themselves.  He writes with deep insight and a real love for his subject.  <br />2.  Whether you agree with him or not, who can doubt that Bloom is a powerful teacher.  At once a worshipper and iconoclast, he challenges and enlightens at every turn.  He is the best of Yale, available for the cost of a cheap trade paperback edition, and without the need to attend class with the rich and snooty in New Haven.<br />3.  Bloom's return, like that of the hero of the Iliad, is not peaceful, but bloody.  In his wonted fashion he turns many shopworn theories about the Bard on their collective ears and slaughters the suitor-scholars without remorse.  See, for example, his powerful and most persuasive chapter on Hamlet, in which he posits that our extant version of this huge play is really Shakespeare's second version, written in response to WS's loss of his only son, Hamnet, and his father within a period of a few months.  The earlier version, now lost, is gutted and dramatically reworked by Shakespeare to become a kind of life's work -- much like Goethe and his Faust.	2002-07-11

This is one of a legion of post-war memoirs that at best stretch the truth and at worst are out-and-out fabrications.  This has been true from The Iliad to All Quiet on the Western Front; from Thucydides through Norman Schwarzkopf's memoirs.  I chalk this one up to myth -- myth being defined as &quot;something that never was true but always will be.&quot;  Tell yourself that this book is a &quot;true&quot; and gripping depiction of the indominatability of the human spirit and don't sweat the rest.	2002-02-25

This a beautifully produced edition with the Greek on the left and Haxton's fine poetry on the right.  As usual, I skipped the foreward and notes preferring to commune directly with the Master rather than through the medium of a posturing chorus of academic factotums.<br />2.

The grandeur, excitement and triumph of this beautiful translation cannot be overstated.  The Oresteia is truly one the most monumental and enduring legacies from the Golden Age.  Here is a translation which befits the greatness of the subject.<br />Some additional random musings:<br />1.  This is one of the many books I was &quot;forced&quot; to read in graded courses at the University, but only really first discovered when I was long graduated and freed from all compulsory studies. In the meantime I have also had the time and passion to study -- very slowly and with great delight -- the originals. <br />2.   As with other &quot;great&quot; works of literature, my advice is to ignore what the &quot;experts&quot; have to say about the work and go straight to the work itself.  Thus, skip the intimidating intro and dive right into the text, doubling back later only if the muse strikes you.<br />3.   After reading and then rereading Fagles' new translation of the Agamemnon, Libation Bearers and Eumenides I am struck by the similarities of the Oresteia in both tone, theme and mien to the greatest Shakespearean tragedies, especially Hamlet.  My dogeared copy of this Aeschylus is now bristling with notes and crossreferences to the Bard.	2002-02-25

It is, as it were, the latest dispatch from the desert revealing Holy Writ hidden for two millennia! <br />1.   Reading the DSS has a kalaidascopic effect on everything I have ever read, pondered or believed about the Tanakh -- it illuminates and enriches and startles at every turn.<br />2.   A question for believers -- how many stars do you give to the Word of God?<br />3.   This translation is magestic and lofty in tone, somewhat reminiscent of the KJV, but plain and unadorned. The editor's introductory chapters provide a grand overview of the history of the discovery of the scrolls and the benighted and myopic attempts of some to limit or halt their coming to light.  Aside from this introduction Vermes nobly stands aside and lets the scrolls unfold their own message for the reader with a minimum of interruptive footnotes and scholarly asides. <br />4.   Unfortunately this edition does not contain any complete or partial translations of books already found in the Tanakh/OT.<br />5.   I am very impatient with the scholarly debates about the supposed messages and portents of the DSS.

At the time I found the subject intensely fascinating, but the writing struck me as highly fictionalized, with lengthy asides describing Joseph Smith's inner motives and thinking processes -- not biography but psycho-biography.  The bottom line was that Brodie pegged Joseph Smith as a deliberate and evil-minded fraud.<br />I recently reread Brodie at the age of 43, now much older and slightly wiser, and also having read a thing or two in my day.  On my second reading I wonder if this book might really have more to do with Brodie herself -- a disenchanted and deeply bitter Mormon -- than with Joseph Smith.<br />There is no doubt that \\"No Man Knows My History\\" has a wide influence in the world.  I would caution the reader, however, to read at least one other biography of Joseph Smith along with Brodie's -- I recommend Donna Hill's unstintingly honest but affectionate \\"Joseph Smith: The First Mormon\\" (Doubleday 1977). If Brodie wrote out of hate, at least seek a counterbalance with the reading of one who has not.	2002-02-24

For those of us amateur and striving souls who yearn to read the Tanakh in the original tongue, a &quot;strong impersonation&quot; of the Word of God is never enough.<br />Having learned to savor Greek in Harvard's beautifully bound and highly servicable Loeb Classical Library editions, I am ecstatic to find a parallel Hebrew/English Tanakh to serve as my temporary crutch as I study the Hebrew. I say temporary, because I am anxious to pursue my lifetime studies of the Bible in the original Hebrew, as fast as I am able.

(I have found that most writers coming from the worlds of journalism or academia lack the ability to communicate on the same level as those of us outside of the twin ivory towers.) But here is an utterly delightful, at times moving, history of one of the most unique languages on the planet.  Part history, part memoir, part dictionary and phrasebook, this book could not have been put together with greater love and craft.  I especially loved the frequent garnishment of Yiddish proverbs and &quot;Sprichworte&quot; throughout the narrative.<br />Some additional thoughts:<br />1.    Especially moving to me are the chapters on the early history of Yiddish in Germany and the nations of Eastern Europe.  One of the great tragedies of history is the unique and fateful relationship between the German people and the Jews.  Born linguistically from German, Yiddish took on a life of its own in the kitchens and shtetls of the Jews.  The author's account of the manner in which moderate Jews turned their backs on Yiddish in Germany in the 18th and 19th centuries is an ironic chapter in the history of Germano-Judaic relations. (I have in my possession a German translation of the Tanakh published in Berlin in 1876, which I read now with a more wiser understanding.) <br />2.  Having both lived in Germany for two years and studied Hebrew on the University level, I can understand much of written and spoken Yiddish. <br />3.   For those who believe in the literal fulfillment of prophetic statements in the Tanakh, the gradual disappearance of Yiddish as a primary spoken language makes absolute sense, as the Jews are restored to their ancient homelands accompanied by the simultaneos &quot;restoration of all things.&quot;  Though it may fade as a spoken tongue, I for one hope that the rich literary tradition of Yiddish never fades.	2002-02-24

The result is a tragic legacy of manipulation, of hatred, of violence and of death.<br />Simon Winchester proves himself the perfect guide to this shattered and tragic realm.  He is part History Professor, part Philosopher but always a masterful Storyteller. With this and his previous books (especially \\"The Professor and the Madman\\") he proves himself to be one of the most eloquent and gripping narrative writers working today.  <br />Some other thoughts:<br />1.   This book ought to be required reading for every American and a warning about the horrible consequences of hate. One of the greatest tragedies of the Balkan conflict is that, as Winchester puts it, \\"almost all the people who have been so horribly at odds with one another are all, in essential ethnic terms, the self-same people.\\"  And lest Europeans and Americans feel smug in their own situations, let them remember the calamities of Antietam, of The Somme, and of Auschwitz.<br />2.   The smart reader will prepare himself or herself with two things before reading.  First, a good map.  The history of the Balkans is so utterly complex on many different levels, not the least of which is geographically.  Second, a good dictionary.  Not since Henry Kissinger have I read an author with his quiver so full of (to me) new and interesting words: e.g. from only the first fifty pages I noted, emollient, osmotically, ordure, gyre, excrescences, orotund, refulgent, meretricious, harquebuses, embrasures, barbicans and ravelins. <br />3.   The editing of this book is horrendously sloppy -- it is an embarrassment to Harper Collins.  I have never seen so many typographical errors, missing phrases and other stupid mistakes.<br />4.    This is not Winchester's best work.  The earlychapters are among his best work, but the narrative loses significant punch beginning in chapter six, which deals with the authors time in Montenegro.	2002-02-24

I first read this edition at age fifteen, and now most recently at age forty-four and continue to find much to startle and enlighten.  <br />As a literary figure, Emerson towers over every other American writer.  Not just through his own Essays and poetry is the arm of his influence so large, but chiefly through his influence on &quot;disciples&quot; like Thoreau, Whitman and a hundred others. His journals are the mother lode of this rich influence. <br />There are few greater books to carry in our own sea bags.	2002-02-19

Cahokia is not only the largest archaeological site in North American, but one of the least well preserved or analyzed ancient civilizations in the world. Located in a present urban area near St. Louis, the failure to study and catalog this site until the past few years is a stunning example of modern ignorance and mismanagment.  This study is the best single volume work on the subject of Cahokia.<br />That being said, the limitations of this volume are many.  It is apparent that Professor Fowler's research is essentially presented by Young, a non-specialist writer.  Unfortunately, the writing is uneven and not particularly memorable.  There is also a dearth of photographs and diagrams.  Finally, I was dissatisfied with the lack of discussion of the context of the Cahokia culture with the other prehistorical peoples of North and Central America.	2002-02-06

The history of the Illinois frontier ought to be one of the truly fascinating recesses of American history -- it is, after all, the scene of the confluence of multiple cultures and influence: the prehistoric Sac and Fox cultures arising from the rubble of Cahokia, the greatest North American pre-Columbian culture; the French and British Influence; the American settlement and finally the Mormon Sojourn.  This ought to be a rich ground for historical writing.  <br />The end result is highly disappointing.  It informs but does not inspire.  The writing is tedious and bogged down and seems to have no focus or theme.  This is a standard academic text, calculated to put its reader to sleep. However, the Bibliography is a helpful springboard to other research on the subject.	2002-02-06

Harold Bloom has never been shy of making bold assertions, and in his The Book of J we have the boldest - that is that the central core of the Pentateuch is the work of single writer - the J Writer - living during the Davidic or Solomonic dynasty.  He speculates that the J Writer is probably of noble birth, of unparalleled education and literary talent and is probably a woman.  In a later work (I think in his \\"The Western Canon\\"), he further speculates the J Writer to be Bathsheba, the fateful love of David's life.  The implications, of course, are that the Books of Moses are of late origin and essentially a work of the imagination arising from the Shadowland of History.<br />This work must be taken for what it is - a patchwork translation of the Torah by a fine poet with an historical introduction written by a renowned literary critic and Shakespearean authority.  I personally am a great admirer of the work of Professor Bloom, but here, I think, he strays into ground where he is (by his own admission) at best an amateur.   <br />Some additional random thoughts:<br />1.   There is considerable weight of authority on the side of Professor Bloom as to the stepwise redaction of the Tanakh by writers and editors in late Old Testament times, though scant authority for his imaginative view of the personal characteristics of the J Writer herself.  However, the entire field of Biblical scholarship and criticism is so volatile and fluid at present, that any \\"authority\\" on the subject represents only one scholars private opinion at any given time.  <br />2.    The current popular view is that the Bible is essentially a profound literary creation assembled by the hands of some late master from early \\"primitive\\" narratives.  A contrary view is that the Bible as we know it is essentially a \\"descent from glory\\" - a miniature and much garbled and mistranslated product which can only approximate a much clearer, earlier and larger corpus of sacred works.<br />3.   Poets might very well make the best translators - though not the most accurate.  David Rosenberg's translation I find to be fresh and compelling.  Reading it gave me a flood of new insights into a text many of us associate most strongly with the language of the KJV.  <br />4.    Bloom's desire for certainty as to the character of the J Writer remind me of his equally vivid but somewhat stretched account of the creation of Hamlet in Bloom's \\"Shakespeare: the Invention of the Human.\\"	2002-01-31

This is the fascinating story of Professor James Murray, the illustrious editor of the OED and one of his most prolific contributors, Dr. W.C. Minor, an American born surgeon committed to England's Broadmoor insane asylum.  Reading more like a novel than a piece of historical research, Winchester's book is highly accessible to the non-specialist and can be read in one sitting.  This is a meaty and nourishing little vignette of history.  <br />Some additional thoughts:<br />1.  Winchester is one of those rare journalists with a knack for historical writing and story telling.  Like I.F. Stone (The Trial of Socrates), his work has none of the hackneyed earmarks of the work of most newspapermen but shows glimmers of true scholarship and insightful analysis.  Winchester is the History Professor I wish I had had as an undergraduate.<br />2.   In recent years there has arisen almost a separate genre of popular non-fiction which focuses on the forgotten and unexplored nooks and corners of history.  These are among the books I have stacked on my desk to be read as casual diversions from more serious reading.  Miniature portraits rather than vast landscapes.  Among these are such entertaining fare as Beethoven's Hair by Russell Martin, Nathaniel's Nutmeg by Giles Milton and The Potato: How the Humble Spud Rescued the Western World by Larry Zuckerman.  The Professor and the Madman is the best of this entertaining little genre. <br />3.    Winchester's writing stands head and shoulders above the crowd.  I wish he would try his hand at something more sweeping, like Thomas Cahill has done in his Hinges of History series.	2002-01-30

Now at last we have a binding worthy of one of the greatest books of all time.  The embossed cover, the lavishly illustrated endpapers and page footers, the vast number of drawings from Thoreau's pen, and the detailed Masorah-like marginalia elucidate the familiar text and enrich the reading experience. The many references in the notes to Thoreau's Journal have lead me far afield into the various editions of the Journal (at least those I can afford).  This is a first rate edition which I hope to carry with me the rest of my life.	2002-01-30

Here he has with obvious relish and great skill tramped over both the old sources and the actual battle sites to come up with a stunning new interpretation of the role of infantry in medieval warfare.  Professor DeVries' command of the sources is impressive.  His narrative powers, particularly in the chapters focusing on the individual battles, are strong and memorable.  Unlike the writings of many of his professional colleagues, Professor DeVries' work is accessible to the non-specialist.  This is a first rate treatment of a neglected angle of history.	2002-01-17

The Stephen Hawkings (A Brief History of Time) and Brian Fagans (Famines, Floods and Emperors) of the world are rare creatures, indeed.  In  The Seven Daughters of Eve Bryan Sykes proves he belongs in that small but fortunate club.  <br />This work is a remarkably well written narrative of Sykes' cutting edge research into the ancestry of modern humans using mitochondrial DNA.  Unlike the DNA in the chromosomes of cell nuclei, which we inherit from both of our parents, mitochondrial DNA is inherited only from our mothers.  It is also highly stable over time, which permits geneticists to determine with almost mathematical certainty the matrilineal genealogy of any human being on earth.  <br />To students of history, prehistory, archaeology and linguistics the conclusions he draws from his research are absolutely stunning.  First, he concludes that all modern humans (beyond reasonable mathematical certainty) are descended from a single woman - Sykes calls her, perhaps tongue in cheek, \\"Mitochondrial Eve.\\"  Second, every person on earth is, in turn, the descendant of one of only 33 women, who were the matrilineal descendants of \\"Eve.\\"  The book focuses on seven of these women who are the matrilineal ancestors of virtually every native European.  These seven he calls, again perhaps tongue in cheek, \\"The Daughters of Eve.\\"  Third, the oldest of the \\"daughters of Eve\\" lived only about 45,000 years ago, the youngest within the past 10,000 years.<br />Some additional thoughts:<br />1.     As with all knowledge, take this with a little grain of salt.  Today's axioms in science may be disproved or reevaluated in a month, a year or a century.  This is cutting edge stuff, and there are likely many surprises to come.<br />2.     Sykes is at his descriptive best when dealing with the fascinating details of his own research and field work.  His writing style breaks down somewhat when he attempts to write imaginative Clan of the Cave Bear-like chapters on the lives of the seven \\"daughters of Eve.\\"  I skipped heavily in this section.<br />3.     I am a little surprised to sense a commercial-like ambience on Sykes' website, oxfordancestors.com.  For a fee his organization will test your DNA and tell you which \\"daughter of Eve\\" you are descended from.  This doesn't exactly lead me to doubt his research, but confirms my suspicions that Sykes has many more skills as a writer and pitchman than most of his colleagues.<BR> <BR>4.     Don't be misled by the title - this is not your standard Sunday School or Bible Class religious tract.  Those who believe that every word of the Bible - through all of the twists and turns of 3,000 years of copying, editing, compiling and translation - is infallible, will perhaps find their faith challenged.  On the other hand, those who are not Bible literalists may find some edification here, as well.	2002-01-16

The concept is undeniably attractive -- provide an incentive for the ordinary reader to embark on a noble life-long quest of self education and betterment.  The dish is irrestible, but there is something fundamentally wrong with this recipe.  Some complaints:<br />1.   As with the earlier editions, I cannot fathom how the Tanakh/Bible can be omitted from a list of the greatest works of Western Civilization. We've got Gilgamesh, Confucius and Mohammed. What's the deal here? This oversight is perhaps excusable in the first edition, but not in the third. How can you leave out the foundational document for Judaism, Christianity and Islam, but include such &quot;luminaries&quot; as Mishima Yukio, R.K. Narayan and Kawabata Yasunari (anyone even HEARD of these, by chance?).<br />2.    In the first and second editions the list of the best books stood at about 100.  Now the principal list numbers 133 and an appended list of an additional 100 works of 20th century authors is recommended.  How have these 130 additional works risen so rapidly into the realm of the immortal in a mere 20 or 30 years?<br />3.    The strongest emphasis in the first edition was on the great works of antiquity, as echoed down the ages.  The emphasis was on a &quot;great conversation&quot; which later writers entered into.  Now the emphasis seems to be on narcicisstic 20th century fiction. My bet is that in 500 years there may be NO work of fiction from the 20th century which is deemed to have lasting value. <br />4.   I wish the authors would disriminate a little more as to the RELATIVE value of the books presented.  Lets face it -- there is a limit to the number of books we can read in our lifetimes.  If you had to choose sight unseen between, say, Shakespeare and Lewis Carroll, how do you discriminate.  A section of theshort list of INDISPENSABLE works would be valuable; such a list might include the Bible as well as Homer, Virgil, Dante, Shakespeare, Goethe and Tolstoy, for example.<br />When all is said and done, this is still a valuable work, notwithstanding its many failings.  It is merely a poor treatment of a great subject.	2002-01-05
