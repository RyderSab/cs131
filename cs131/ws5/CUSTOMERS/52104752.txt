After reading a few pages, I knew I had to buy it and I finished it in half a day because I simply could not put it down.<br /><br />The narrator of the story is a 15-year-old (presumably autistic and obviously precocious) boy who lives in working-class England and embarks upon the task of solving the mysterious murder of a neighborhood dog. The most outstanding part of the novel is the narrator himself. Haddon brilliantly endows his narrator with unconventional powers of observation and yet the character of the narrator comes across as a real person rather than as a literary device created by the author.<br /><br />The book is a satisfying read and I would highly recommend it to everyone. In fact, I would have given it to my 9-year-old daughter but for the fact that the language is somewhat too coarse in parts (the adults are almost universally foul-mouthed, but the narrator never is). For adults, however, I cannot but give this book my highest recommendation.<br /><br />Jeremy W. Forstadt	2005-09-29

Susan Casey profiles Peter Pyle and Scot Anderson, two biologists who have been leading shark research at the islands which are located just 27 miles due west of San Francisco. She also documents her own (ultimately disastrous) experiences gaining access to the islands which are largely prohibited to the public. The stars of the story are the sharks themselves, who turn out to be far more individualistic and personable than you would probably ever imagine.<br /><br />The white sharks of the Farallon Islands are perhaps the best studied in the world in their natural state. The circus atmosphere which surrounds white shark research in places like Australia and South Africa have largely compromised the sharks natural habitat making it difficult to observe sharks behaving naturally. The Farallon Islands, known to 19th-century mariners as \\"The Devil's Teeth,\\" are a dangerous and foreboding locale, but one that lends itself well to scientific investigations. Casey takes us through the history of exploitation, inhabitation, and research that has taken place on the islands over the past 150 years, and she includes a healthy amount of information about the other wildlife in evidence on and around the islands. But she clearly (and admittedly) developed an obsession with the sharks, and the narrative of the book is continually steered back toward them.<br /><br />The thing that struck me the most in THE DEVIL'S TEETH was the description of the individual white sharks' strong personalities. I would never have thought that a white shark could be described in terms of being \\"gentle and maternal\\" (Whiteslash) or \\"happy-go-lucky and somewhat goofy\\" (Half Fin). Other individual sharks, of course, had more sinister reputations. Still, one can come away from reading this book with the impression that the great white shark is truly a likeable animal, if not exactly huggable. Another revelation (to me, at least) was the evidence that at least some white sharks, like whales, apparently have fixed migratory routes that can take them thousands of miles through the course of a year. Some (the females) appear to have two-year migrations since they only show up every other year in the Farallones.<br /><br />Susan Casey takes us into an exclusive place, to be sure: a world where cage divers and eco-tourists are looked down upon with disdain. In a way, it hardly seems fair that the experience of witnessing the thrill of a white shark kill should be so restricted. As Peter Pyle himself said, \\"I feel sorry for anyone who hasn't seen one.\\" Of course, it is understandable. As in nearly other place in the world where white sharks congregate, the delicate ecosystem of the Farallon Islands would suffer tragically and research effort would be compromised from increased human intrusion. THE DEVIL'S TEETH is a glimpse into the world of two committed biologists and the truly majestic animals they study.<br /><br />Jeremy W.

Selling for as much as one hundred dollars an ounce, caviar has become an icon of status and success, and as such, it has led to the inevitable decline of that curious and prehistoric fish: the sturgeon.<br /><br />Carey exams both the fish as a species as well as the industry that seeks to exploit it. The fascinating and ancient phylogeny of the sturgeon notwithstanding, this fish is clearly in trouble. In the last two decades, sturgeon populations have shrunk to less than one third of what they were. Much of U.S. trade in caviar, as elsewhere, is illegal, but up until now, those who are working to save the sturgeon are largely ineffective. As in the drug trade, the potential rewards to be reaped by the caviar industry have led to energetic smuggling operations, the mislabeling of sturgeon species on caviar tins, as well as other shenanigans. Among the many storylines covered in THE PHILOSOPHER FISH, Carey follows the efforts of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to stymie the illegal trade in caviar, though as a result of 9/11, their resources have largely been diverted elsewhere.<br /><br />Carey also follows several of the sturgeons' champions in this world as they seek to improve the fish's plight. There is some slight hope in the efforts of those that hatchery-spawn sturgeon species for aquacultural purposes and possibly for future restocking projects. In his search for every sturgeon-related experience he could find, Carey even ice-fishes for sturgeon in Lake Winnebago, one of the few places in the world where this can be done (strict quotas make the season as short as only 2 days a year), but he clearly feels conflicted about it (he didn't catch anything). He drinks vodka along the shores of the Volga River as he observes the trade, both legal and illegal, of the world's most famous caviar locales.<br /><br />THE PHILOSOPHER FISH takes the reader around the world, from Sacramento to the shores of the Caspian Sea. Many of the stories involve intrigue and espionage of the highest order. Others are humorous or bitter-sweet. Still others offer hope. All are intensely interesting. I enjoy reading books that tell me more than I ever wanted to know about one circumscribed subject. THE PHILOSOPHER FISH is such a book, and I give it my highest recommendation.<br /><br />Jeremy W.

In contrast to many of the other regions of the world in which he has traveled and of which he has written, the Mediterranean has a long literary history consisting of native writers and expatriates alike. In much of this book, Theroux manages to skirt the most touristed regions of Mediterranea while seeking out the landmarks and icons (some living) of the literary Mediterranean. In some ways, THE PILLARS OF HERCULES is substantially different than any other travelogue published by Theroux.<br /><br />In other ways, however, this book remains true to the Theroux we have always loved or reviled. How could it not be? Theroux's acerbic pen has not lost its bite, and his misanthropic self is as prominent a character in this book as it is in all his others. Now, however, he is treading a sacred path: one which, for once, may have been crossed by a substantial number of his readers.<br /><br />Beginning in Gibraltar, Theroux's plan is to circumnavigate the Mediterranean while remaining as close to the water's edge as possible. The plan to stay within sight of the water sometimes causes Theroux (or perhaps it provides the excuse he needs) to miss some of the more popular locations of the Grand Tour, yet it keeps him close to those who make their livelihoods at the shores of the great sea. In one of the most traveled regions on earth, Theroux manages to find those out of the way places--not gems perhaps, but surprisingly untouched by the tourist trade--where we can really experience a sense of place and of culture.<br /><br />THE PILLARS OF HERCULES ends up being a deeply satisfying work for those who love to travel in a vagabond manner, though perhaps not for those whose travels consist of packaged tours and managed activity schedules (and perhaps not as well for those possessed of eternally sunny dispositions). Whatever your travel preference, I would strongly recommend this book to anyone pondering a Mediterranean vacation. There is bound to be something interesting or entertaining here for anyone.<br /><br />Jeremy W.

For a few years, I lived barely a cast away from an artificial lake liberally stocked with bluegill which me and my buddies proceeded to assassinate at a terrifying pace: sometimes pulling as many as 100 a day out on cheese bait and marshmallows. Despite living near the ocean, I only managed to go out once on a day boat to Catalina and in addition to the many mackeral I pulled in that trip, I managed to land a bonito (which narrowly lost the jackpot to a fair-sized halibut, I might add). I once caught a trout while on vacation in Colorado. This is about the sum total of my fishing experience. As an adult, to say that I am an indifferent fisherman would be generous. I can't even remember the last time I picked up a pole. This is why I was as surprised as anyone recently when, while flipping the channels on my satellite system, I landed on the BASSMASTERS program on ESPN2 and ACTUALLY STAYED THERE AND WATCHED IT.<br /><br />I watched the program in its entirety and, I must admit, it was not uninteresting. I was a little surprised, to say the least, when I saw these men jumping aroung like maniacs, dancing on their boats, and otherwise acting goofy and hamming it up for the cameras whenever they caught each fish. Needless to say, one of the loudest was Mike Iaconelli. I remembered that name Several days later, as I perused the new titles shelves of my local library, serendipity intervened and this book, FISHING ON THE EDGE, popped out at me. I added it to my growing stack of books to look at and possibly review this week.<br /><br />I read FISHING ON THE EDGE in one sitting. Iaconnelli broke down the sport of BASS tournament bass fishing for me--a sport and a league I hardly knew existed a week prior--and he made it interesting enough that I may just check out those ESPN programs again the next time I am flipping through channels. FISHING ON THE EDGE is Mike Iaconelli's auto-biography, but it is also more than that. It is an introduction to tournament bass fishing which includes not a few of the sport's dirty little secrets. Iaconelli pulls no punches when he exposes the sometimes shocking behavior of the other pros on tour, the tournament officials, and even himself from time to time. But, outsider that he is (a New Jersey hip-hop kid in a sport dominated by southern good ole boys), he displays a deep affection and respect for the sport and for the sport's greatest stars.<br /><br />I also learned quite a bit about fishing itself. Sprinkled throughout FISHING ON THE EDGE, Iaconelli offers generous sidebars which shed light on everything from his theories about tackle, technique, lures, boat positioning, and his favorite fishing locales as well as a guided tour of his several tattoes and his suggestions for how to watch a bass tournament as a spectator. Underlying it all, is the portrait of the man himself: what motivates him and how he came to become a champion bass fisherman.  As inspiring as the story is, I have no desire to be a bass fishing pro. Those guys work too hard. However, I may just have to sneak out to the lake one weekend this summer and see if i can land me my first bass. Go Ike! I'll be routing for you at this year's Classic.<br /><br />Jeremy W.

At least, it is not anything that I have ever noticed before. This error, regrettably, tended rather to taint the entire book for me, so forgive me if my observations fail to accord with your own.<br /><br />Al Franken is a funny guy. Now, it has been said by some that actors, musicians, or funny men should just spend their days engaging solely in the practice of their own vocations for which their own, specialized gifts and training (i.e. acting, singing, being funny) have adequately prepared them. They should likewise spare the rest of us from having to listen to their political views. After all, they say, these people are not professional, licensed, or board-certified politicians and thus should not venture into such fields that their own professional degrees or training (i.e. Acting, Comedy) have not properly prepared them (as opposed to, for example, the professional study of Law, Political Science, or Country Music). Concerns of this sort are, as often as not, voiced by pundits (whose own unique place in society exempts them from having to be qualified for anything). Often overlooked by these pundits, however, are the multitudes of non-comedians who seek to be funny--seek even to be regarded as funny men--though they clearly do not possess the natural ability, training, or board certifications to lawfully do so.<br /><br />J. P. Mauro is not a funny guy. Unfortunately, there is no cure for this. In AL FRANKEN IS A BUCK-TOOTHED MORON, Mauro's cleverest bit is the title itself, albeit this cleverness is borrowed from Al Franken himself. What could have been a good idea is ultimately a failure. For a book like this to succeed, it needs to depend upon humor which is sadly lackluster in this attempt. Conservatives should purchase this book and leave it on their coffee table unread. Their friends will appreciate the joke, but then again, they hardly need a reminder of their own righteousness.<br /><br />Jeremy W.

About the size and weight of a Peterson Field Guide, SPORTSMAN'S GUIDE TO GAME FISH by Byron Dalrymple is as good as any of the modern field guide to fishes as an aid in identifying the many fish species (it only lags slightly, perhaps, in the quality of its color plates). It especially excels in presenting detailed knowledge of each fish species in a way particularly useful to the angler, such as their habits, food preferences, seasonal character, and weight ranges.<br /><br />SPORTSMAN'S GUIDE TO GAME FISH presents detailed suggestions on tackle, lures, and bait to use on each species and in every condition the angler is likely to find them. Similar species of fish are painstakingly described by Dalrymple so that any fisherman in possession of this guide can feel confident in the identification of every fish on his hook. This guide covers the 138 freshwater and 190 saltwater species most desired by the sport fisherman today, and its size fits nicely in the bottom of your tackle box.<br /><br />Jeremy W.

This is not a bad thing. The sport of politics can be thrilling and subtle to its most ardent admirers and gifted participants, but when a book comes along that is clearly targeted at the simpler, less sophisticated members of American society, it is helpful to post obvious flags and signs lest they lose the message. Lists are easy to compile and easier to grasp and are less apt to tax even the most idle mind, and Mr. Goldberg clearly is adept at packaging his product for maximum impact in the marketplace.<br /><br />That being said, it is difficult to view this book as more than an anachronism, given the passing of the 2004 political season and the current lame duck presidency. That I rate this book rather low should in no way discourage the blunt-minded from purchasing and enjoying this book. Though this book is conspicuously lacking in substance, one can say the same thing about any number of reality shows on TV which appear to be enjoying a rather extended golden age. I am not one that typically chooses to infringe on the happiness of others, so I will not say that this book is worthless, just that its appeal might vary greatly depending upon who you asked and in which southern state you asked it.<br /><br />Purchase this book and set it out in a a visible place--a coffee table would do nicely if your trailer has one--so as to telegraph your political alignment to all your friends and family. This should serve to give them fair warning about the place into which they just stepped foot, and is apt to stimulate lively banter around the dinner trays.<br /><br />Jeremy W. Forstadt	2005-07-07

Based around (and one might be tempted at times to add \\"loosely\\" here) a series of shark attacks which plagued the New Jersey shoreline in the summer of 1916, CLOSE TO SHORE is as much a history of the Edwardian Era in America as it is a recounting of the shark attacks themselves. Taken as a broad history, it can be an enjoyable and rewarding reading experience.<br /><br />That being said, I can certainly understand the complaints of some that Capuzzo is excessive in his \\"period history.\\" In particular, at times he delves deeply into the biography and genealogy of characters that are, at best, only tangentially connected to the events surrounding the actual shark attacks. In addition, the author takes considerable license in ascribing thoughts, emotions, and motivations to his characters in a novelistic fashion. My criticism, however, remained mild through the opening chapters despite several warning signs. Again, if you allow yourself the explanation that you are truly witnessing the history of a place and a time, then the book actually works quite well.<br /><br />The history, after all, has a purpose. Americans, in 1916, felt that they were on the cusp of a truly modern age where man had finally obtained physical and moral dominance over his environment. Yet, it was also an age of innocence or even naivet&eacute;. In subsequent decades, humankind would gain a greater recognition of their insignificance and powerlessness in the face of greater forces. The Great Depression, the World Wars, the Galveston flood, and other events would soon strip this innocence violently away, but in the summer of 1916, Americans were blissfully unaware of what the century ahead would hold for them. The shark of 1916 would be one of the first agents of the changes to come in our national psychology.<br /><br />However, when the chapter which, by its title, suggested the shark's long awaited appearance turned out to be merely an account of the courtship between of the shark's parents, the thoughts of Aristotle on the topic of shark mating, and the water temperatures of Long Island Sound, Capuzzo began to lose me a bit. And when the following chapter returned to the languid and fanciful descriptions of various Edwardians filled with their noble thoughts as they strolled along the boardwalks of their seaside towns, I realized (with some genuine terror), that I was approaching a quarter of the way through the book and had yet to see any blood. I am a huge fan of works exploring broad historical contexts, but enough is enough! I was ready for some shark attacks.<br /><br />And, as long as we were taking our slow walks down the boardwalk, I would at least have expected the history to be accurate. Some of the facts splashed around exposed a shocking carelessness of the author, even to my unpracticed mind. To give just one small example, Capuzzo casually refers to the Winston Churchill of 1916 as \\"a young war correspondent,\\" when, in fact, by that time Churchill's career had already included his serving as First Lord of the Admiralty for several years (1911-1915) while 1916 saw him commanding a battalion of the Royal Scots Fusiliers on the Western Front (he once had been a young war correspondent, but that had been during the Boer War of 1899. Furthermore, the quote attributed to the \\"young correspondent\\" was not actually written until 1923). These are minor facts to the story, but are numerous enough to disturb me even on my first unconscious reading.<br /><br />In short, there is much to be enjoyed in CLOSE TO SHORE, but the book is flawed through its lack of direction and the loose fact-checking of the author. I would warn lovers of history or of natural history, that it is entirely possible that this book will be a disappointment to them, unless they also have a healthy love of the novel and a forgiveness of bending the truth for dramatic purposes.<br /><br />Jeremy W.

For one reason or another, I have taken this volume off my bookshelve many times, opened it to a random chapter, and read a paragraph, a few pages, or a chapter at a time. Never more than that. I have often tried to connect the theory in this book to archaeological questions, but I have mostly failed in my attempts to visualize an operational method of applying its lessons. It has become increasingly evident to me, as I struggle with the contents of this work, that this is in fact less a theory of art history and more a history of historical and cultural change: a work of anthropology, or at least one of anthropological interest.<br /><br />Kubler is not attempting to explicate the influences of history on stylistic changes in art. He is, in reverse, introducing the analysis of art forms to issues of historical change. This may be (perhaps suitably) a distinction of little merit to some. However, it is enough to curl the toes of at least some members of the anthropological community. Stylistic or symbolic interpretations of art through history--perhaps a more traditional history of art--are replaced by the notion that human actions or ideas, manifested through time, are reflected in art across history and that differing works of art can be recognized as manifestations of the same actions or ideas through time. If you don't understand this, then perhaps you are as confused as I am right now.<br /><br />Kubler begins with the following statement of assumption: \\"Let us suppose that the idea of art can be expanded to embrace the whole range of man-made things, including all tools and writing in addition to the useless, beautiful, and poetic things of the world.\\" He is therefore effectively expanding the definition of art to include all material and ideological culture, thus extending the more limited discipline of art history into the realm of general anthropological theory. Actually, Kubler is expanding the definitions of both art and history. \\"the moment just past is extinguished forever, save for the things made during it.\\" The accumulation of material and ideological culture alone survives to represent the evolution of humankind. This point may be self-evident to the archaeologist. However, it is a profound statement nevertheless, pointing out, if nothing else, that what may have been perceived as limits of archaeological inquiry, may be, in fact, the actual objective of such inquiry.<br /><br />The present is the intermediary between the future and the distant past. \\"Actuality is when the lighthouse is dark between flashes: it is the instant between the ticks of the watch: it is a void interval slipping forever through time: the rupture between past and future: the gap at the poles of the revolving magnetic field, infinitesimally small but ultimately real. It is the interchronic pause when nothing is happening. It is the void between events.

And much of this flying was in the old days: in the early years of the Army Air Corp and a young company called TWA. Much of this flying was accomplished without the assistance of modern instrumentation. Captain Buck travelled the world seeking the most ornery weather he could find, and then flew into it time and time again, compiling the experience and collecting the data that no one else had at the time. Captain Buck shares that experience here. This book is interesting and engaging to the flying enthusiast, essential to the VFR pilot, and absolutely priceless to the aspiring instrument pilot. Every discipline and every pastime has its classics, and WEATHER FLYING is, without a doubt, one of the classics of aviation.<br /><br />The language of WEATHER FLYING is simple and straightforward. The lessons are practical more than theoretical, though Captain Buck keeps his readers briefed on essential weather theory as well. Virtually every weather situation that a pilot can encounter is covered in this book, from the ordinary to the exotic. Then Captain Buck instructs you how to fly it. The concept is simple and direct; the lessons are comprehensive and pragmatic.<br /><br />In short, this is not a book to read once and then shelve. The lessons are too important to be forgotten. This is a manual to be taken down and read over and over again by any sort of pilot who flies any sort of aircraft.<br /><br />Jeremy W. Forstadt	2005-06-30

I must have spent countless hours with this book when I was young, because even now as I reread the book years later, the colorful language of the narration is so familiar to me. Despite its delicate condition, this is a book I still take down and peruse every few years at least.<br /><br />Some of its descriptions are dated--one can no longer legally fish for Garabaldi, for example (\\"these fish... can be caught on very small hooks... baited with the soft part of a mussel\\"), and I don't think the surf fisherman is as common or as vaunted as he once was on this coast (\\"the aristocrat of ocean fisherman is the surf angler\\")--yet this book continues to excite the imagination and make me want to take to the seas and fish, though I no longer live near the coast.<br /><br />Raymond Cannon is more than just an experienced fisherman. He takes us into the life histories, the habits, and the behaviors of all the fishes found off the western coast of the North America. His technique is exhaustive. He details the tastes of the individual species and the combination of hook, line, sinker, and bait it takes to land each one. He not only outlines the character of each species of fish, he paints an often amusing portrait of the character of every species of angler as well.<br /><br />\\"Bad men go tame and tame men go mad over the prospect of catching a few ALBACORE.\\" In many senses, the Pacific Coast of this book is that of a bygone era. The fishing has changed as species disappear or evolve (generally for the worse) due to over-fishing, pollution, encroachment, and a hundred other factors. And the fish illustrations are primitive by the standards of today's field guides. Still, I can't imagine any fisherman who would not enjoy the lively narrative and lessons offered by classic work.<br /><br />Jeremy W. Forstadtare primitive by the standards of today's field guides.

The quirks of his spelling and punctuation alone seemed to me to be contrived and overly pretentious and I felt instinctively (without reading it) that his poetry must be some sort of grand put-on. I am even today still not completely convinced he did not suffer some form of mild to severe brain damage (perhaps progressive) that increasingly affected his later writings. However, once I was introduced to the man through this excellent collection, I could no longer deny the stunning originality of his poetry or the gorgeous music of his lyrics, particularly when read aloud (most effectively and rewardingly to an adoring female audience of one). I have been converted into an admirer through this collection.<br /><br />100 SELECTED POEMS is a fine and concise introduction to the works of this nonconformist poet. There is a sampling of his very best poems and enough variety to sway all doubters. This collection wisely (I feel) avoids the more terrifyingly eccentric typography of some of his more notorious efforts, though some of the later poems in this collection push the envelope far enough to be discomforting (but in a good way). No collection of American poetry would be complete without e.e.cummings, and this book rattles like a fragment of angry candy.<br /><br />Jeremy W. Forstadt	2005-06-25

Incidentally, the death of this particular bookstore had been long in coming. With a Borders across the street, I was not particularly alarmed or concerned at the little drama I was witnessing. The reductions began several weeks prior to the expected closing with 25% off everything in stock. In the weeks to come, I made a point of malling in its general vicinity so as to check in periodically as the store emptied and the reductions rose. Like the shark I am, I entered gleefully to participate in the final dismemberment once the magic discount of 75% was reached. So, that's the story of how I came to own this book.<br /><br />I am as yet undecided whether a book on letter writing should be derided as an anachronism, or extolled as something virtuous yet woefully absent from today's bookshelves. Sadly, I believe there are far too many modern households lacking bookshelves at all or, if bookshelves are indeed present, they are more likely to hold vintage Star Wars toys (collectables?) or porcelain pig figurines rather than books. If you hold to the theory that any book is better than no book, then this book undoubtedly has some merit. However, it was not exactly what I thought it would be. I guess I was expecting a quainter book that brought back a bit of the golden age of letter writing: courting the girl next door or describing in vivid detail the most wonderful time you and Mumsy are having on the continent and just who you happened to have met on the steamship passage over. What I got, disappointingly, was a book of business form letters. Here is a sample:<br /><br />\\"Dear Mary Daylily:<br /><br />I'd like to add your name to our Professional Educator subscription list--at no cost to you--for four months! That's right, four free issues without any obligation...\\" well, you can imagine how that letter proceeds. Is this a guide for the aspiring form-letter marketeer or--dare I say it aloud--spammer?<br /><br />You will find no discussions of style in this book. A little theory of letter writing would have been nice. You won't find that here. What you will find is a collection of sample letters, just one of each type, and the letters tend to be somewhat dry. Complaint letter? One example. Collection letter? One example. Wedding invitation? One example. Apology for a dog attack? One example.<br /><br />To be fair, there is a chapter on message composition touching on word choice, conciseness, style, and other useful stuff. This makes the book almost worth its 75% markdown. Almost.<br /><br />Dear Ms. DeVries:<br /><br />I'm sorry to let you know that the 2nd edition book product we acquired two months ago has not met our expectations.

Here's the thing. When I was growing up, my mother baked the most wonderful oatmeal cookies. They were soft and didn't flatten out much, so they stood up like little mountains of tasty goodness. Now that she doesn't cook anymore (God knows why), I have been unable to find cookies quite like them: oatmeal cookies bought in mall bakeries or baked by my colleagues at work are (inevitably) flat cookies that are either stiff and crunchy or soft and chewy. Now, I loved crunchy oatmeal cookies and chewy oatmeal cookies as much as the next guy, but I miss the old softies. Enter THE KING ARTHUR FLOUR COOKIE COMPANION!<br /><br />THE KING ARTHUR FLOUR COOKIE COMPANION outlines nine \\"essential\\" cookies and oatmeal cookies are one of them. For each of these \\"essential\\" cookie types, the authors include from two to four basic recipes depending on what style of cookie you want to bake. Thus, for the oatmeal cookie, for example, there are recipes for a chewy cookie, a crunchy cookie, a crisp cookie, and (tada!) a SOFT COOKIE! My prayers have been answered.<br /><br />But wait, there's more! There are literally dozens of variations on each \\"essential\\" cookie. Just choose the basic recipe that matches your preferences and then follow the additional instructions for creating the variation. Thus, each variation can be made in two to four different ways. In addition to oatmeal cookies, the other \\"essentials\\" are chocolate chip, sugar, molasses, peanut butter, shortbread, biscotti, brownies, and decorated cookies.<br /><br />The \\"essential\\" cookies and all of their variations comprise less than a third of this book, so there are plenty of other cookies of all sorts included here; virtually any cookie which regularly occupies your dreams and aspirations can be found in THE KING ARTHUR FLOUR COOKIE COMPANION as well as many other you dared not dream existed. Gingerbread Houses? You bet! Hamantaschen? There is even a recipe for making your own hamantaschen filling from scratch. Mailanderli? I don't even know what that is, but it's here!<br /><br />As a beginning baker myself, the part of THE KING ARTHUR FLOUR COOKIE COMPANION that I find extremely helpful is the \\"Getting Started\\" section. This generous section lays out the whole theory and practice of cookie baking from recommended equipment to technique to what makes a cookie spread out or become crunchy or burn, etc. More than just a kitchen reference, this is a book that I can curl up with and just read for pleasure (though it does make me hungry).<br /><br />For the beginning baker like myself to the experienced hack to the cynical master chef, I give THE KING ARTHUR FLOUR COOKIE COMPANION my highest rating: five brownie points.<br /><br />Jeremy W.

I have heard Rich Wolfe described as the \\"best-selling sports author in America\\", and I have no reason to doubt it. He knows how to churn out topical volumes on a variety of sports subjects and market them effectively and often regionally. <br /> <br />As in nearly all of his books, FOR RED SOX FANS ONLY is a collection of entertaining and humorous stories on the topic at hand-in this case the long-suffering baseball team and its fans. This is a book of stories BY fans and it is written FOR fans. Although Wolfe largely serves as the editor and presenter of these stories, you may occasionally find him inserting the odd joke or funny quip. What one is left with is an enjoyable volume for the dedicated sports fan and light reader. Though this is a rough collection, I believe that any true BoSox fan will find it enjoyable, funny, and worthwhile to own.  <br /> <br />Jeremy W. Forstadt <br />	2004-12-14

The daughter's letters to her father survived: unfortunately Galileo's letters to his daughter did not. Still one gets the impression that their relationship was warm and we catch glimpses of the human and personal side of Galileo.<br /><br />As biography and as history, GALILEO'S DAUGHTER succeeds admirably. It is a very readable and engaging book and encompasses Galileo's early life up until the time of his death. In addition to its insight on the personal life of the man, the book details the scientific questions that consumed Galileo as well as the political and religious atmosphere of the time that seemed alternatively to work both for and against him. Ultimately, the pope betrays Galileo, his former friend, and the heartbreaking history of Galileo's persecution and confinement unfolds.<br /><br />Throughout, Galileo's daughter shares the joy in his triumphs as well as the tragedy of his downfall, and her letters add touches of humanity to the history. I highly recommend GALILEO'S DAUGHTER as a work of history. Those expecting a novelization of the life of Galileo, however, may be disappointed.<br /><br />Jeremy W. Forstadt	2004-12-14

Borror's DICTIONARY OF WORD ROOTS AND COMBINING FORMS for at least 20 years and would never dream of parting with it. Though I consult it only rarely, it can be immensely helpful when one wishes to delve into the meaning of obscure words, particularly of the scientific or bio-medical sort.<br /><br />This dictionary is comprised mainly of an alphabetical listing of Greek and Latin roots, though commonly used roots and combining forms from other languages are included as well. There are also useful chapters on the formulation of scientific names, the transliteration of Greek words, and on common combining forms. This last chapter (the one on common combining forms) is particularly useful if your goal is to create new descriptive words as it is conveniently subdivided into descriptive categories (color, size, shape, animal structures, etc.).<br /><br />I would have to admit that the DICTIONARY OF WORD ROOTS AND COMBINING FORMS would not be near the top of any list of writer's \\"essential\\" references, but I do not mean to imply by this that it is not worth owning. On the contrary, I believe that this happy little dictionary is highly useful-though specialized-and should be included in any complete writer's library.<br /><br />Jeremy W. Forstadt	2004-12-09

No writer, email user, student, or English speaker should be without a stylebook and THE ASSOCIATED PRESS STYLEBOOK is the one I have always chosen to use. This edition is designed to be useful, both in its portability as well as in its spiral binding which allows any page to be opened flat upon the desk, leaving the hands free for the writing task. <br /> <br />Style choices are often neither right nor wrong, but one should be consistent in, for example, the way certain words are spelled when alternate spellings are equally in use (ketchup, Hanukkah, doughnut rather than catsup, Chanukah, donut), the way certain abbreviations are represented (a.m., p.m. rather than AM, PM; Ariz. rather than AZ) as well as capitalization choices (tollhouse cookies; the King of England and the English king). THE ASSOCIATED PRESS STYLEBOOK is an extremely useful guide in helping the writer make these choices uniform throughout his writing. <br /> <br />Another very useful feature of THE ASSOCIATED PRESS STYLEBOOK is its extensive listing of commonly misused and misspelled words, trademarked words, and company names. Many of the listings include factual references which, though primarily designed for use by journalists are also helpful to the general writing public (such as where the headquarters of major companies are located, which colleges comprise the Pac-10, etc.). Some facts may be less useful, though still interesting (frankfurters became known as hot dogs in 1906 after cartoonist T.A. Dorgan depicted a dachshund inside a bun). <br /> <br />Inexpensive and invaluable, there is no reason why THE ASSOCIATED PRESS STYLEBOOK should not be in any writer's library. I give this reference my highest recommendation. <br /> <br />Jeremy W. Forstadt	2004-12-08

From the army's earliest engagements against French forces in Morocco (one almost forgets we fought the French) to the expulsion of the German army from Tunisia six months later, Atkinson vividly profiles the major players on all sides, the missteps and miscalculations along the way, and a thorough account of events, both admirable and atrocious.<br /><br />North Africa, Atkinson argues effectively here, is where the American Army learned its deficiencies, its lack of preparedness, and the faults of its leaders but also where it grew up, realized the formidable task that lay ahead of them, and ultimately proved its mettle.<br /><br />The political maneuverings and intrigues faced by the American commanders (Eisenhower in particular) form not a small portion of this book and are as fascinating as the campaigns and battles themselves. The English, the Americans, the French (once they were on our side, sort of) are equally suspicious of and patronizing to one another and this makes for very entertaining reading.<br /><br />It is hard to imagine that once this three volume history is completed that it will not form one of the definitive accounts of World War II.<br /><br />Jeremy W.

What he finds there is a pervasiveness of hypocrisy, duplicity, and callous self-interest mirroring his own character and which eventually destroys him. The novel is Stendhal's contemporary indictment of the chaos and vacuity of post-Napoleonic France.<br /><br />Some novels hold up remarkably well through the passage of time and the changing of venue, and THE RED AND THE BLACK is one such novel. The story itself is engaging and enjoyable and the social representatives encountered throughout the narrative, including the protagonist Sorel, are very recognizable to the cynics and social critics of today. The truth that Sorel, the climber, uncovers is that these social types are present at all levels of society.<br /><br />But I don't often look for symbolism when I read and I enjoyed THE RED AND THE BLACK because it is a rollicking good story told with great introspection and wit. For that, I endorse this book with my highest recommendation.<br /><br />Jeremy W. Forstadt	2004-12-06

As I have no doubt stated elsewhere, the best way to experience David Sedaris apart from going to a live reading is to hear his work on the radio or through his audio recordings.

After performing a number of his wartime monologues live, they were collected and published in this rather short book.<br /><br />Rochlin was a B-24 navigator during WWII and his tale of his war experiences is raw, rather course, not pretty at times, and yet darkly humorous. Rochlin is remarkably frank about his experiences, more than one of which may shock the sensitive reader. This is unlike any other narrative I have ever read about the Second World War: more personal and in many ways far more human.<br /><br />Whether the events of this monologue are true or not does not really matter; I am sure that Rochlin (like David Sedaris) would say that they are \\"true enough.\\" They form a story in Rochlin's mind, a narrative that he feels compelled to tell. I for one am more than willing to listen.<br /><br />Jeremy W. Forstadt	2004-11-30

Hempel is a classic exposition of the scientific method and should be considered required reading for all scientists as well as informed lay persons. Do not let the title of this book mislead you, among its most ardent supporters are the practitioners of the social sciences in addition to the expected audience of \\"hard\\" scientists (Though PHILOSOPHY OF SOCIAL SCIENCE is another volume in this \\"Foundations of Philosophy\\" series, it is nowhere near the classic that this volume is).<br /><br />Far from just a theoretical work, Hempel skillfully injects easily understandable case studies and examples into his writing. Proceeding from the basic logical construction of the scientific method to more complex ideas challenging some of the classically held views, Hempel is always accessible, always clearly understandable.<br /><br />This is a surprisingly enjoyable book to read and short enough that it shouldn't intimidate anyone.

John Adams is not the sexiest of America's ex-presidents and lives on largely in the shadows of the more famous and flashier founding fathers such as George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson. David McCullough's biography, JOHN ADAMS, in part confirms this image of the second president: he was intensely private, reverent, and loyal. However, the positive qualities of the man come shining through as well in this work: his personal integrity, fidelity, and love of country. One comes away from reading JOHN ADAMS with the feeling that history has not given this man his due.<br /><br />Nowhere does John Adams come off in a more positive light than when he is contrasted to his great friend and nemesis, Thomas Jefferson. Clearly, McCullough is a partisan of Adams, but one reading this book cannot help but feel the same. John Adams is the thrifty self-made man, Jefferson, the spendthrift playboy. Adams is the only founding father strongly against slavery on moral grounds, and yet history only remembers him for the Alien and Sedition Acts.<br /><br />But, the man alone does not make the biography. What makes JOHN ADAMS a great biography and a recommended read is McCullough's narrative style which brings life to the man and brings the reader fully into the world of the revolutionary and early nationhood period of American history.<br /><br />Jeremy W.

In the middle of the Pacific Ocean in November 1820, the 238-ton Essex was rammed and sunk by an angry sperm whale. Over the next three months and 4,500 miles, the dwindling crew fought the open sea and each other in a struggle for survival. Although the story no longer resides in our national consciousness, it is a story worth telling and Nathaniel Philbrook does an admirable job of it with IN THE HEART OF THE SEA.<br /><br />Piecing together first-person accounts, Philbrook recreates the final voyage of the Essex in remarkable detail. He provides a vivid picture of the life and work aboard a Nantucket whaler in the early days of the whale trade. However, the bulk of IN THE HEART OF THE SEA concerns the events following the sinking of the Essex as the crew of twenty officers and men crowded into three small, open whaleboats pondering their fate. After three months, two whaleboats (now separated by hundreds of miles) and five men remained and were eventually rescued off the Chilean coast.<br /><br />The story of survival on the high seas is both harrowing and moving: the suffering unimaginable. Resorting to cannibalism to sustain themselves, at one point they had to draw lots rather than wait for the next man to die. Again due to the accounts of survivors, Philbrook is able to recreate these months in astonishing detail.<br /><br />What emerges is a multi-faceted book which not only tells a compelling tale of high adventure and survival, but also illustrates beautifully a lost era in American history. I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />Jeremy W. Forstadt	2004-11-28

Nancy Milford offers a glimpse into the life of this shooting star based on exclusive access to the personal papers and letters under the care of Norma Millay, the poet's sister.<br /><br />SAVAGE BEAUTY is a compelling biography of a colorful and intriguing poet, though it treads only lightly on the poetry side. This is not necessarily a problem since the character of Edna Millay is engaging enough. Notoriously promiscuous and a commanding presence in front of a crowd, Edna Millay also had a complicated private life beginning with her odd upbringing of near abandonment. Milford is able to brilliantly relate the personal story of the girl to the public persona she transformed into as the number one poet in America. Both public and private facets of her life are well covered in this volume.<br /><br />For an enjoyable read and a glimpse into American life during the 1920s, I strongly recommend this excellent biography.<br /><br />Jeremy W.

Its informal and conversational style (based on his responses to a series of questions posed by the CBC producer who is interviewing him) allows us broad-stroke insight into L&eacute;vi-Strauss's development of structuralism and his theories about science.<br /><br />A self-professed \\"non-scientist\\" with a strong interest in science, L&eacute;vi-Strauss begins by outlining the divergence between science and \\"mythical and mystical thought\\" which began to occur around the 17th century in European intellectual traditions. The result is, we are lead to believe, that we have somehow lost something: something we may yet strive to regain or at least try to understand better.<br /><br />L&eacute;vi-Strauss makes the argument that `primitive' thought is as rich and complex as so-called `civilized' thought, debunking various functionalist and traditional viewpoints that deny the savage mind has the ability to think both disinterestedly and intellectually. \\"In order for a culture to be really itself... its members must be convinced of their originality and even... of their superiority over the others.\\" Mythical thinking may be the originality that we have lost in modern life.<br /><br />One gets the sense that L&eacute;vi-Strauss develops his theories as he speaks-extemporaneously. He almost admits as much in his introduction: \\"I forget what I have written practically as soon as it is finished... I have the feeling that my books get written through me and that once [finished], I feel empty and nothing is left.\\" Some of his explanations of particular myths, though entertaining, are a bit \\"out there\\" and border implausibility. One may reproach him for his methods or dispute his theories, but no one can deny that MYTH AND MEANING provides a fascinating glimpse into the mind of this original and controversial thinker.<br /><br />Jeremy W.

To those who may feel intimidated by reading \\"classic\\" literature (and especially as one as large and ominous as this unabridged version) I would say \\"fear not!\\" This novel is one of the most accessible and enjoyable reads you can find from any literary era.<br /><br />Like others who have already written here, I simply could not put this book down for several days until I had finished it. Dumas's style of writing cliffhanger endings consistently throughout the novel plays well to today's generations (myself included) who have been raised by television and movies. THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO reads like a compelling dramatic series (as it once was when published) that you simply never want to end. Woe to those who chose an abridged version of this book!<br /><br />I read all kinds of books for all kinds of reasons. Don't look here for realism, profound philosophy, or exercise for your intellect. One may choose to read \\"the classics\\" for a variety of reasons, but THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO, to me, is a purely guilty pleasure that I can engage in without thinking too much.<br /><br />Jeremy W.

The scope of this book is impressive and its particular strength is in the detailed personal narratives concerning the men who shaped the history of Europe and the world at this time.<br /><br />The most compelling of these narratives and the most interesting exposition of personality must be the storyline concerning the Kaiser, William II. Alternatively child-like in his petulance and his longing on approval from his family (that being the English royal family) and regal in the assertion of his imperial prerogative and in his capricious vanity, William is flawed, but ultimately likable.<br /><br />This volume is powered by dozens of other richly textured character studies on both the English and German sides from Otto von Bismarck and Queen Victoria to Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz and Winston Churchill.<br /><br />Personally, I am a fan of naval history (or more generally, the history of technologies and warfare) as well as a fan of general history. For the naval buffs, I would recommend the sequel to this volume: CASTLES OF STEEL, over this work. However, for general history, you won't find anything better than DREADNOUGHT.<br /><br />Jeremy W.

After reading a few pages, I knew I had to buy it and I finished it in half a day because I simply could not put it down.<br /><br />The narrator of the story is a 15-year-old (presumably autistic and obviously precocious) boy who lives in working-class England and embarks upon the task of solving the mysterious murder of a neighborhood dog. The most outstanding part of the novel is the narrator himself. Haddon brilliantly endows his narrator with unconventional powers of observation and yet the character of the narrator comes across as a real person rather than as a literary device created by the author.<br /><br />The book is a satisfying read and I would highly recommend it to everyone. In fact, I would have given it to my 9-year-old daughter but for the fact that the language is somewhat too coarse in parts (the adults are almost universally foul-mouthed, but the narrator never is). For adults, however, I cannot but give this book my highest recommendation.<br /><br />Jeremy W. Forstadt	2004-09-13

Although I am not, generally, a reader of nature studies, Dillard's essays seem just perfect to me. If I had a single criticism, it would be that she generally ties in a theme or moral to her story to the extent that it would almost seems forced , but the language is so beautifully descriptive and the resolutions so elegant, that I am willing to forgive her for it.<br /><br />In \\"Total Eclipse\\" she manages to describe the experience of witnessing a total solar eclipse in ways that are otherworldly and profoundly beautiful (and even slightly terrifying). Nothing has made me want to experience a solar eclipse myself more than Dillard's essay. In the title essay, she begins by describing \\"...a man in his thirties who lives alone with a stone he is trying to teach to talk.\\" From this, the essay expands eventually into a commentary on cosmology and theology and the palos santos trees on the Galapagos Islands, and yet it all seems to be a natural evolution. This is the way with all of her essays.<br /><br />Dillard's studies almost feel like free association, though like a perfect jazz solo, what seemed random and disconnected finds its way back home again as naturally as if it were scored.<br /><br />Jeremy W.

You are as likely to come across his books in the local supermarket or drugstore as in the bookstore and he knows how to churn out topical volumes and market them effectively and often regionally.<br /><br />As in nearly all of his books, FOR CUBS FANS ONLY is a collection of entertaining and diverse stories on the topic at hand-in this case the excruciating yet lovable baseball team. Although Wolfe largely serves as the collector and presenter of these stories,  you may occasionally find him inserting the odd joke or funny quip. What one is left with is an enjoyable volume for the dedicated sports fan and light reader. Though this is a rough collection, I believe that any true fan will find it enjoyable, funny, and worthwhile to own.<br /><br />Jeremy W. Forstadt	2004-09-10

The randomness of this evident, in Juniper's mind, makes it the perfect laboratory for investigating this question. \\"Here at last one could surprise His intentions in a pure state.\\" Before the victims had even hit the ground, he already plans on investigating their lives. Short, beautiful, and nearly perfect, THE BRIDGE OF SAN LUIS REY earned Thornton Wilder the first of his three Pulitzer prizes.<br /><br />The lives of the five victims of the bridge are thoroughly recounted leading up to the moment they all came together to cross the bridge. Brother Juniper came up with his conclusions regarding the tragedy, but ultimately, he was not satisfied with his results. He did, however, realize that he learned least about the victims in question in speaking with those that were close to them. It was these very survivors, however, away from Juniper's questions and after the friar's execution who ultimately did find some answers.<br /><br />I was moved by the final conclusion of the book: that out lives are transient and unremarkable but to those whom we love and who love us, and our very existence dies with those that cared for us.  \\"...almost no one remembers Esteban and Pepita but myself... But soon we shall die and all memory of those five will have left the earth, and we ourselves should be loved for awhile and forgotten. But the love will have been enough...\\" I can't find a better argument for living in the moment.<br /><br />Jeremy W. Forstadt	2004-09-09

For three Saturdays in the spring of 1978, I was glued to the television set as Affirmed won the Triple Crown that year. After that exciting series, I pestered my father to take me out to Santa Anita or Hollywood Park whenever I could get away with it, and in my freshman English poetry journal (recently unearthed), 90% of my poems were written about horseracing. I remember going with my father to see Affirmed win the Hollywood Gold Cup in 1979 and so become the first horse in history to win more than $2 million in his lifetime. It was at that race, that I learned about the story of Seabiscuit who had won the inaugural running of The Cup in 1938.<br /><br />I discovered Ralph Moody's book in the library sometime soon after that memorable race, and I must have read it 20 times for all the events of that horse's life were still ingrained in my memory as I read through Laura Hillenbrand's book many years later. Moody's book focused more on the horse as a character and included details of Seabiscuit's earlier unsuccessful and unhappy career under famed trainer Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons--a part of the history largely ignored by Hillenbrand.<br /><br />What I remember is a highly compelling, readable, and inspirational book: Seabiscuit and Affirmed became my leading sports heroes during that era. COME ON SEABISCUIT, though written for the older child or young adult, is a very readable book for adults as well, and due to its complementary history, would be an excellent companion volume to those who have discovered Seabiscuit through Laura Hillenbrand. I recently rediscovered and purchased the book for my own 9-year-old daughter. I am happy to see that this extraordinary book is now enjoying a resurgent and well-deserved popularity after all these years.<br /><br />Jeremy W. Forstadt	2004-09-08

This collection offers an excellent selection of Collins's previously published poetry as well as some new ones.<br /><br />Collins has a way of turning the simple and mundane into the wildly humorous and devastatingly poignant. His accessible style is deceptively simple and, judging by some of the other reviews of the book, a bit off-putting to those I imagine in my head as \\"those of lesser imagination.\\" Collins's poetry works for me in its simplicity and beauty. But, it's not like I am waiting breathlessly for Collins's next book to be released or for his next appearance on National Public Radio.<br /><br />It's not like that.

Theroux, as always, plays the curmudgeon and misanthrope throughout. This, of course, is the main reason I enjoy coming back to Theroux time and time again. Who needs to read another travelogue of fluffy descriptions of tourist destinations and restaurant reviews?<br /><br />Theroux seeks \\"adventure\\" and he finds a fair amount of it in his train travels through the Americas. Although he speaks against the novelistic approach to travel writing, his own character consistently inserts itself into the story which in my opinion reads much like a novel in a positive way. Politically, the book is dated and we must expect that much has changed in Central and South America over the last 20 years. However, THE OLD PATAGONIAN EXPRESS remains a highly entertaining read and I recommend it heartily.<br /><br />Jeremy W. Forstadt	2004-09-06

Though my own days of careless travel seem to be largely behind me, it is pure pleasure reading Theroux's cynical and insightful views on foreign travel and culture and his encounters with fellow travelers and locals never fail to amuse. RIDING THE IRON ROOSTER does not disappoint.<br /><br />As in all of his travel books, the most interesting and engaging character often is Theroux himself. Fussy and pretentious at times and never romantic, he is also refreshingly judgmental, while generally avoiding the chauvinism common with Western writers and travelers. Like Somerset Maugham, he is a man of the world, yet unlike Maugham, his biases and complaints are personal rather than nationalistic. We can usually identify with his trials and frustrations and share in his annoyances.<br /><br />The Chinese are a curious and foreign people and I have always found them difficult to relate to and inscrutable. Theroux perfectly captures the feeling of strangeness that being amongst them evokes, though oddly enough it is the Americans and Europeans he encounters who come off seeming like the representatives of the truly alien culture. Theroux spends an entire year traversing China and immersing himself in the local culture, and by the end of the book I find myself understanding, or at least tolerating the Chinese more and the Americans less.

If you have not heard David Sedaris on the radio, then you really must try to see him at one of his readings or book signings. His stories are best heard out loud, and no one tells them better than Sedaris himself. That being said, the written stories are excellent and this collection in particular must be owned.<br /><br />The standard Sedaris fare is here as he mercilessly picks on the members of his own family (as well as on himself) for humor's sake. My favorite stories, however, all concern his misadventures in France among the French as well as among the Americans he meets abroad. His sadistic French teacher (of several stories including the title story) and the American couple on the subway who assume he is French and speak openly about him in English are just classic foils for Sedaris's misanthropic character. Humor writing doesn't get any better than this.<br /><br />Jeremy W. Forstadt	2004-09-06

There is a general recognition among Americans (including members of both major parties) that the Democrats advocate tightening environmental legislation while the Republicans seek to be responsible to the economic needs of our country while dealing with environmental issues.

I doubt if I would have been able to get through this horrific and sickening tale otherwise. His attention to detail and storytelling are well known from his other works, and I found that UNDER THE BANNER OF HEAVEN was of similarly high quality. This is a book to read if you don't mind having a few nightmares in the coming weeks.<br /><br />In addition to recounting a recent brutal murder of a woman and her child, UNDER THE BANNER OF HEAVEN expands into fairly good history of Mormonism in general. I found the history engrossing and informative, but also slightly disturbing: especially when it came to the more recent history of Mormon fundamentalism. I am not Mormon myself, but I must say that I was more than a little disturbed at what seemed at times to be a broadsided attack on the religion as a whole. Perhaps some of it is warranted, but I am afraid that the juxtaposition of the murder story with the broad history of Mormonism will create false associations in the readers' minds. Perhaps this is the intent, but if that were the case then I am more than a little disappointed in the author.<br /><br />That being said, the quality of the writing is as outstanding as the usual Krakauer work and on the whole, I can earnestly recommend this dark book.<br /><br />Jeremy W.

After reading this work, one is left with more questions than answers. Yet,  I suspect that there is no bamboozlement going on here, despite some readers apparent loss of faith as the more fantastical episodes unfold. Accepting the author's premise that the purpose of this story is to invoke a belief in God, I would add that religious works of any worth invariably leave one with more questions than answers and leave it at that.<br /><br />In the end, the book is satisfying and stimulating and it lingers long on the brain after the last pages are read. Although there are episodes within the increasingly odd main story which begin to challenge credulity, the shocking epilogue--while not exactly neatly tying the loose ends together--at least provides enough of an explanation to make the whole of the novel comprehensible (while provoking some to a second reading in search of answers).<br /><br />I am not one that insists on finding the deeper meaning of everything that I read, but I revel in the language and color of a story. I don't pretend to understand the meaning of Wallace Stevens's poetry, for example, but I am struck by its beauty and rhythm. Martel's novel has a similar effect on me.<br /><br />Jeremy W.
