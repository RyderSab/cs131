I would definitely say I enjoyed it as much as \\"The Princess Diaries\\" series. Sure, it was mostly fluff but not pathetic,cheesy fluff that was a waste of paper like some books. It was a very fun read for summer. Sometimes you need a break from your serious reading to read something that didn't require much thought & you could breeze right through it---this book did that. At the same time,it has that \\"cinderella\\" element to it that all us girls like to dream about deep down & that made it really fun to read. So girls, go read this for something different, & have fun!!!!	2003-08-04

My suspicions were actually quite accurate. I'm just happy I only spent eight dollars or so on it!!! I'll admit Patterson's plot for this book was pretty brilliant, but that was all it had going for it. His writing skills aren't too good. His character development was bad & the way he portrayed the newlyweds couldn't have been more cliched. It really made me want to gag. There has to be a way to write a thriller/mystery without the descriptions being cheesy. There are novels like this that have literary quality. In my opinion, any author who chucks out novels this quickly , it means the books won't be that great. But, hey, if you just want something to keep you guessing & don't mind that aside from the plot, the writing is pathetic, go for it.	2003-08-04
US	43684860	R2WAA6MF1WQ2T2	014028009X	738261988	Bridget Jones's Diary: A Novel	Books	3	3	3	N	N	It Was Okay	I did enjoy reading &quot;Bridget Jone's Diary&quot;, it was a funny, witty &amp; a fun reading experience. It did realistically &amp; originally portray dating through a woman's perspective. I also found it to be repetitive, she covered the same subjects again and again. Also, Bridget's obsession with weight was just annoying, annoying enough that I wanted to skip any paragraphs that described weight issues--even though there really was no reason for it to be an issue. In addition, some parts were really boring &amp; pointless, for example, Bridget spent half of a page describing how her fingernails were messy, &amp; that she needed an emery board. She was a character that you loved &amp; hated. She was witty &amp; fun, but at the same time, she acted stupidly around men, and drank and smoked all the time.Plus, it was very dumb when she complained about smoker's rights.This is a light, fluffy, summer reading novel--don't expect anything more. But, overall, this was a novel that I hoped I would love, and tried to love, but in the end, it was just mediocre to me.	2003-07-30

The format in which it was written made it so much better--going back and forth from past and present. The author was able to truly capture the essence of the human spirit in this novel. I was amazed by it and found it to be very beautiful. This book was somewhat about a crime,and it could have been a cheesy crime drama, but she was able to build so much around it that it became a wonderful novel. This was a novel that once I opened it, I wanted to do nothing but continue reading it. It felt so real,and some sections of the novel were almost heartbreaking. What I loved about this book, is that Ms. Picoult was able to portray love and grief, without cliches, it was portrayed originally and beautifully, and that it why it is such an outstanding novel.	2003-07-24

Yeah, it was quick, easy read, but it lacked depth & was a bit cheesy at times. It just didn't have that \\"stay up all night reading it\\" quality, which is what I look for. I am just disappointed with it & I wouldn't really recommend it, read \\"The China Garden\\" instead.	2003-05-08

I believe that the plot of \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" could have been wonderful & something I would love to read, because the events are all such interesting ideas. I just think that Mr. Hawthorne made them boring through his writing style. Sometimes it just dragged on forever & I really think more of the book consisted of descriptions than dialogue---I couldn't enjoy a book like that. I think if this was written by a different author, with mainly the same plot, it could be wonderful. But this, was terribly boring!!!!!!!!	2003-04-30

You really root for the characters & it is an empowering novel. This novel was so funny & witty-----it is delicious. This is one of those novels oyu can breeze right thorugh, and have so much fun with it.The plot is so original & well done.

Weetzie Bat is, in my opinion, the best of the Weetzie Bat series, not to say, that it isn't outstanding all on its own. No one else could ever write like Ms. Block: her style is gorgeous, poetic & entrancing. Plus, this volume is such a cute little copy, with a really pretty cover, even if you own the whole series in one book (Dangerous Angels), you need this little copy, too. This was just such a great,creative story, & if you don't enjoy it, you have to be insane. It is & will always be one of my favorite books ever, and I think everyone should read it.	2003-04-26

Its great to have the entire \\"Weetzie Bat\\" series in one book, and they are all SO good. They are written so beautifully, and you can't help but get caught up in the characters' stories and lives,as they grow, because all the characters are so lovable. These are all really unique and wonderful books, and I love how the author doesn't waste time in these books talking about things that don't matter in the plot, everything in these books matters. I would recommend these books to everyone, because I don't think I'll ever read anything like these again, and its a great experience.	2003-04-26

Having a volume of one of the best poet's ever almost complete collection. This is a book that I treasure, all the poems are masterpieces, and so beautiful. No one will ever write or think like Sylvia Plath again. This is a must-have for all of her fans. I own many poetry volumes--and this has to be my favorite.

It was a gift, and I can see why people like it, with all the great reviews, but I just didn't. Something with Greeley's writing style did not go well with me. It was an easy read--but all the history stuff confused me at times--so many people and events, it was like, are you in the past or present? I thought the plot & events were good, but I just really did not like this book. A lot of people might, though.	2003-03-28

I read \\"Princess in Waiting\\" in 2 sittings.I loved it because it is so wonderfully good. And coming from me, that should mean something, because I am a teen, but I don't really like teen books too much, with this series as one of my few exceptions. This fourth book lived up to the other three, it was addictive. This series does keep getting better, with each book entrancing you, and makes you unable to put it down, even as you try, as \\"Princess In Waiting\\" did. One critic said it is like \\" reading a note from your best friend\\", and that is so true.You get caught up in the story and the people, that is one of the great qualities about it.You think it is your life, and that you know them. This is the type of book/series that you wait for months for the next one to be released. I did, and I wasn't disappointed. Read it, you won't be either.	2003-03-28

The theme & plot were well done, but I just don't think the theme was right for Ms. Shreve to write about--it just didn't work. I really like her work, but I just couldn't love this, like the others.

It was a bit confusing, one of those books that you have to read between the lines so much just to understand what is happening. If not, you can get totally lost. To me reading is supposed to be fun, and not work just to understand it. I think authors should just flat out tell you what is going on, and this book didn't do that. I wouldn't recommend this book, especially if you want a leisurely read, don't choose this.	2003-03-22

Anne Tyler has such a way of making ordinary lives fascinating. None of her novels have a lot of twists and turns, and either you like it or you don't. Some people can appreciate the ordinary, and there are others that this would not be their best choice. Anyhow, this novel demonstrates that. It takes the ordinary, and makes it beautiful. I thought it was really good,you becomes attached to the characters and their lives, and hope for them to be happy. I would definitely recommend this book,it is another great novel from Anne Tyler.	2003-03-18

I came across moments in my memory where I confused this novel with my own life. I feel as if I have experienced it, in a way.  Everyone hears of rape, this made it seem real, instead of something that only happens to other people. Overall, I feel the novel was wonderful, truly captivating, I didn't want to stop reading it. It is great to go through the brave character's journey of the rape, trial & healing process. It was written so beautifully and I find it to be an amazing contribitution to literature.

I know this is a good novel because I was never able to tell what was going to happen next. It is such an inventive novel &amp; I love how descriptive it is. I gave it 5 stars because, other than the ending, was pretty much perfect. It being old makes it all the much better. Mysteries today seem like they were made on an assembly line.

I had a good time reading \\"The Last Time They Met\\" by Anita Shreve. I gave it a four because it got boring sometimes & was hard to keep me paying attention to it. I thought it was very creative of Ms. Shreve to start from the end & end in the beginning, write the book backwards. I also would have to say that the ending was something I'll never forget & I never would have thought of it in a million years.I was so shocked. Because of this, this will be a book that always stays in my mind. It was just so original. I thought this novel had a great plot & characters.

I think that love & passion result in the best inspiration & in the case of My Sergei: A Love Story by Ekatarina Gordeeva, this holds true. I think that because of the pain Ekatarina suffered that it resulted in this wonderful book. I know that she is an ice skater, but she could also very well be a great author. She was able to convey her life so eloquently that it made My Sergei unable for me to put down.I know celebrities always pretend to be in love & divorce a couple months later, but there was obviously such a love between Sergei & Ekatarina. Iwas so nice to see them grow to love each other so naturally through reading the book. I may love reading, but I seldom cry from a book and this book truly affected me enough that I cried. Its just beautiful.I would definitely recommend My Sergei because it is charming & heartfelt.	2002-08-23

Her short stories seemed so real, instead of fiction.  Ms. Tan had such insight into the characters & what they had to deal with.She was also so creative in these stories. Ms. Tan definitely demonstrated the feelings of women at different ages and showed how your perception of life changes from age & lifestyle. The Joy Luck Club also displayed the strength that women possess to get through really difficult times. I gave this book a 4 because it was fantastic & I read it quickly but not a 5 because it was not perfect.	2002-08-18

It served as a good look into teenage life & all the aspects that can be involved. Most people think of teenagers as sex-crazed & a lot of drug & alcohol usage, which is true, but this book showed the other side to that. I read Dreamland very quickly & overall enjoyed it. I would recommend it as one of the better young adult books, when most are cheesy & lack any importance.	2002-08-15
US	43684860	RDXINIX8AJ684	0380017601	509203925	Love Story	Books	4	0	0	N	N	A easy, quick read!!!	Love Story by Erich Segal is very far away from everything I usually read. It has a romantic aspect & is just mainstream. Usually I would be so exasperated by this sort of book but I really enjoyed it.I read it really quickly & easily. I thought the whole plot was just soooooooo cute. The way the 2 main characters had a \\"love to hate\\" relationship & started out arguing & realized they loved each other. I couldn't give this novel a 5 by far because it was so obviously written by a man. There was no depth into the characters feelings or thoughts for it including such a tragic time. That is why it is 4 stars. :)	2002-07-04

I read 150 pages in one sitting--which says a lot about a book. I have to say that when I got this book, I was enticed by the title because I like the name Fiona. When I first started reading it, I saw Fiona, the main character, as pretty much a slut & someone I wouldn't like if I ever met her.Fiona Range became really good & you saw that Fiona was more than just a slut. I could relate to her struggles of trying to fit into her conformed life with her aunt & uncle. She struggled to grow close to who she thought was her father & deal with the fact that she was 30 & had become nothing & constantly made mistakes. This novel had a very surprise ending & I really thought it was creative & well written. It's only (small) problem was that it did have some sub-plots that threw you off, but the significant events ending weaving into an understandable story. i would definitlely recommend this book, for even someone who doesn't enjoy reading. It's worthwhile!!!!	2002-05-19

I really enjoyed More Than Wanted, it's only problem was that it started out kind of slow.It wouldn't have worked out right though if it had gone right into the plot.It did start out good though & continue that way. I liked the storyline a lot & this book was sentimental & poetic. It was a nice love story that showed what power love has over people. It is written in chapters seperately narrated by the 2 main characters. This was nice because you saw what was going on seperately in their life & their different takes on the situation. More Than Wanted had all the elements of a good novel: a little romance(not trashy), drama & a little insight into the characters interesting lives. It deserved 5 stars because I thought it was great & had trouble putting it down. You should go read it!!!	2002-03-23

I've seen a lot of great reviews for I Know This Much Is True but I don't agree with most people. I loved Wally's first book, She's Come Undone but I can't say the same for this. It seemed to go on forever saying nothing in particular. It may have had the same style as She's Come Undone but I didn't like it. I thought there was no point to it & that all those like 800 pages were full of babble. I gave it 2 stars because it wasn't horrible, just boring. If you want something that will motivate you to read....God, don't choose I Know This Much Is True.	2002-03-15

I had trouble choosing between a 3 &amp; 4 for the stars but chose 4 because it wasn't bad enough to be a 3. It was good in the sense that there was a section foreach character &amp; it all started to pull together. It did get boring sometimes, though &amp; I didn't like the ending. Binchy does have a talent and it can make you feel like part of the book, sometimes loving or hating the characters. I would say, in the end, it was worth reading &amp; enjoyable.	2002-03-07

I could never think up all the names &amp; gadgets in this novel.What great about it is it's not just for kids. It has the simplicity of a children's book yet I didn't get bored with it like other books that are way too young for me. In fact,I was quite addicted to it -- I read far into the night &amp; couldn't stop after the first in the series--I had to start the second one. There is a lot of controversy over this book but what it really comes down to is it's a great novel &amp; since it is imaginative that is good. Children need imaginations &amp; that doesn't mean they will try to study witchcraft. My goodness!! That's why it's called &quot;pleasure reading&quot;.

I got this novel for my birthday &amp; my mom read it first &amp; told me she loved it but I didn't get around to reading it because i didn't think it would be too great.I really liked Fortune's Rocks. I found The Pilot's wife to be an excellent novel.I would have given it 5 stars but it took a while to get good. Like 130 pages--because that was more of Katherine's mourning process.It had a wonderful plot &amp; the characters were well developed--I loved realizing what went through Katherine's head. There was so much emotion &amp; the events kept me up well into the night with my little rerading light. I would recommend this as a great read or gift.Two thumbs up!!!	2001-12-17

I gave it a 4 instead of 5 because it was good but it became much better at the end instead of the whole way through. You could tell the author did all his research &amp; was very knowledgable on the subject of midwifry. I especially enjoyed how it was narrated by a 13 year old because you got to see the world through her eyes &amp; her aspect on what was going on. I just thought the whole book was very great &amp; it was one that I didn't want to put down &amp; it was a worthwhile choice. I recommend it to you or use it as a gift!! :)	2001-12-02

I really enjoyed Saint Maybe &amp; I thought it accentuated her talent!! I would select this as a good novel to start out with for this author, to get you hooked(like me)!!

This was my first novel by Ms. Berg & I found it to be pretty good.It certainly wasn't the type of a novel that you couldn't put down but it was very sentimental & brought on tears. It was once called \\"the love story of the year\\" & in a way I agree because it was out of the ordinary--the characters husband was in a coma after they had had 2 children & a majority of the book was her describing the little things he did that made him so special to her & her memories of them together.That made it romantic & touching & not like some where guy meets girl & they have sex that first night!

A Long Fatal Love Chase was interesting  because it was just recently published when the author has been deceased so long &amp; also because Ms. Alcott is known for more happy stories like Little Women. I rarely read mysteries but I saw this novel in a used book store and when I saw the author I had to have it and the mystery part really did sound good.My prediction was right.This story of a young woman being stalked around the world by her lover who emotionally abused her was excellent. It showed determination on the character's part &amp; each time I thought I would put it down something else came along so I had to keep reading.It showed another side of Ms. Alcott that I really liked--she broke out of her shell!!!	2001-10-05

Maeve Binchy is my favorite author &amp; I've read a lot of her books but this was very different from what she normally does. I was really suprised at how touching &amp; emotional &amp; personal Tara Road was. All of her books have that type of plot but she really showed the emotions the characters go through during the plot really rawly.She spent about the first 230 pages describing the plot very boringly &amp; I didn't think I'd like this book very much due to that but ending up really enjoying it b/c I saw later the signifigance &amp; reasoning for it. Maeve had to make a perfected existance for the character's family to show later how much it was really destroyed &amp; how deeply the people were affected by it. I was astonished at this novel at how deep Binchy dug down to get those emotions &amp; really make you feel it.	2001-09-01

I was great to be able to read &amp; see 2 girls go through their stages &amp; grow up &amp; it was easy to relate to &amp;  made you reminisce of your childhood &amp; how you got to adulthood.

Free the Animals was a great novel for animal lovers &amp; everyone else.It opened the eyes of our society to the raw cruelty in labratories.I got very involved in the book while reading it &amp; it has a diverse plot with suspense,romance &amp; everything else.Free the Animals describes an account of an ex cop doing the opposite of what she should do--going against the law in order to save animals lives.It is very descriptive in the aspect of what really goes on behind closed doors.Free the Animals really deserves 5 stars &amp; I recommend it to anyone!!!!	2001-06-24

Christy was a great novel totally worth reading.I did'nt want to put it down &amp; it had well developed characters with drama, romance -- let's just say it had it all!!!I would definitely recommend it to anyone b/c it's a wonderful novel about the power of love in our daily lives.GO READ IT--YOU'LL LIKE IT!!!!	2001-06-19

I  found this to be pretty much worth reading.It was an interesting book with okay characters & an alright plot that had mystery & hilarity both.I would'nt recommend it if you're looking for a really good read due to it being a bit cheesy & unrealistic yet sometimes we just need to read a book like that.But I think Smart vs. Pretty was alright for light reading but it won't ever become a classic--I can guarantee that!!!!	2001-06-19

I'm not at all a fan of Danielle Steel's writings but I actually found Granny Dan to be a good novel.Now let's face it--Steel is known for her soap operalike writing as a drama queen but Granny dan was a beautifully written novel about the life of a ballerina in Germany during WWI.I would recommend Granny Dan BUT if you're lookinf for a new favorite author-- look elsewhere.	2001-06-19

Chasing down the Dawn was an amazing novel.Jewel's words were just like her lyrics--poetic &amp; insightful to the human spirit.Rather than it being the story of her life--it was emotions of her experiences thar were written.It was a wonderfully beautiful novel that will light the way in literature --showing how a book should be written.The illustrations were very creative &amp; altogether it was a very enjoyable book in which things were expressed that are in most hearts but Jewel was able to put on paper.I gave it a 5 stars which Chasing Down the dawn truly deserves for the heartfelt story that it is.	2001-06-19

I first got this novel from the library &amp; was skeptical as to if I would like it.I read it in one day when I was home sick.It is beautifully written &amp; it will touch your heart.Candles on Bay Street is the story of a wonderful friendship that through distance still lasted &amp; of the sacrifices we must make for those we truly love.This novel is one of the few books I can say I really love &amp; has been worth reading many times.Candles on Bay Street is a moving story that shows that even today when the world seems so lost there still is love &amp; beauty.Throughout this book you will laugh &amp; cry &amp; become close to all the characters &amp; seem to feel with &amp; for them.You must read this novel--it will be totally worth it.	2001-06-18

I'm a young adult myself & I had nearly given up hope with YA books & have transfered completely to adult books but this gives YA Fiction a better reputation.You'll never want to put this book down b/c it has everything-mystery,love,drama,etc.It was creatively written with many twists & a mythological background to boot.I definitely would recommend this book<br />& I think most people would enjoy it--Ive read it many times!!	2001-06-18

If you read this novel,you will agree that you were unable to put it down.The pages practically turned themselves.The Glass Lake is Binchy's best &amp; it has great characters b/c Binchy really is an expert of human nature so her characters are well described.The monologue is absorbing &amp; this book is full of great events so that you'll keep wondering what'll happen &amp; you just root for or against the characters &amp; almost become part of the book.Enjoy it !!!!!	2001-06-10
