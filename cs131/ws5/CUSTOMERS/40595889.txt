My own experiences with public schools led me to home schooling in the 1970s, which makes my mother a pioneer.  Back then though people looked at her as though she had just arrived from Mars.  I made the leap to private school at twelve.  Twenty-one years, three books and a master's in professional writing later, I can see the educational system hasn't gotten any better.  In its defense, the US educational system tends to squeeze the life and curiosity out of students and teachers.<br /><br />Even Debra Ginsberg, who spoke last year at the Palm Springs Writers' Conference, admits that she fell prey to the same blinders people often show towards kids who don't fit the \\"sit down and be quiet\\" mold in public schools.  (The liberal elite expresses horror at the elitism of private schools while sending their kids to them, and horror at religious schools while ignoring the discipline and respect kids can receive.)  She has difficulty with teachers offering diagnoses of \\"problem kids\\"---a valid point.  but she has sympathy and respect for the teachers themselves.  Principals are often portrayed as bad guys, but one principal of Ginsberg's son Blaze's school writes upon retirement:<br /><br />\\"It has been a real pleasure to know you and Blaze.  I have appreciated the benefits of the positive approach your entire family takesm as each person helps Blaze to grow while making it clear that he is well-loved.  You have done a great job of supporting him this year.  He is in good hands as a member of your family.\\"<br /><br />Single-mom waitress Ginsberg has a strong, loving family of eccentrics that make Katharine Hepburn's family (as depicted in \\"The Aviator\\") pale in comparison.  Coming out of people who think outside the box (and yet know how to work the system), how could Blaze be other than extraordinary?  Sure, he doesn't color inside the lines or sit in line, but the overwhelming positive embrace of his abilities and personality in this book shows that there is a place for everyone, even in a world where we can't see past the surface and glibness masquerades as wisdom.  Ginsberg offers no excuses for her son; she doesn't ask for any pity or portray herself as a victim.  This is not a whining memoir.  She shows how her family helps Blaze to grow and to conform in the way that everyone has to (\\"Go along!  Go along! Go Along!\\" mocks Henry David Thoreau in THE NIGHT THOREAU SPENT IN JAIL) for pleasant social interaction, but she also accepts and acknowledges that Blaze has a right to be different, e,g, not eating sandwiches.  So do we all.<br /><br />There are marvelously funny, poignant moments in this book, and Blaze's poem \\"Breanna Crying\\" as well as his songs are not to be missed.e embrace of his abilities and personality in this book shows that there is a place for everyone, even in a world where we can't see past the surface and glibness masquerades as wisdom.

All of the books did S31 justice, but this one more so of course.  And I am categorically stating this now: Sloan is one of my favorite Star Trek characters, picking up where Elim Garak left off.  Garak gets discussed in \\"Abyss\\" when Ezri tells Julian he's attracted to mystery...like Garak.  Julian responds, \\"I always thought of Garak as charming, not mysterious.\\"  Ezri replies, \\"He was both,\\" and then suggests that Julian is inexplicably drawn to charm and mystery.  In this case, she speaks of his new nemesis, Ethan Locken, a genetically enhanced Khan Noonien Singh wannabe.  Unlike Syndrome of \\"The Incredibles\\" (another tale about people with superhuman abilities wearing masks), Locken wants himself and himself alone to be \\"super.\\"  And Julian has to stop him thanks to our favorite covert ops agency.  Section 31 knows his worst fears and his weaknesses...however, as we saw in the series, they can clearly underestimate him.<br /><br />Cole, the new Section 31 agent who sends Julian Bashir on a mission the eve of his trip to Earth with Ezri (to visit Julian's parents no less, \\"Then it must be love,\\" Cole says), remarks on Julian's past dealings with Section 31: \\"Courteous, but direct.  Sloan noted that in his profile...Anyone who could outthink Sloan wouldn't have a problem with a tyro like Locken.\\"<br /><br />Cole is intelligent, ruthless, smooth, and less compelling than Sloan, who had tremendous Garak-like appeal as a sexy spy villain who saw himself as a \\"good guy\\" of sorts (the complexity and sexiness was in large part thanks to the casting and performance of William Sadler), with better lines than Cole and more personality, thanks to the unique onscreen chemistry between Julian and Sloan.  Change one letter in Cole's name and, appropriately, you get \\"cold.\\"  Although there's an intelligent and dynamic analysis of the Federation's enemies as well as some mentions of the genetically enhanced \\"Jack Pack\\" (savants Julian interacted with in the series), and a subtle reference to \\"In The Pale Moonlight\\" in a discussion between Cole and Julian, Section 31 is clearly the despised enemy as they always have been.  Julian hates Section 31 but, as he did in the series, is forced to employ their tactics to defeat them, just as Sisko had to compromise his morality in \\"In The Pale Moonlight.\\"  Dancing with the devil and staring into the abyss...and yet Julian isn't lost to intrigue.<br /><br />When Julian faced Sloan in the series, he had Miles O'Brien to pull him back from the brink.  This time, he has the still-confused Ezri Dax, whose relationship with Julian grows and becomes deeper than the soap-opera of \\"Avatar.\\"  Ezri has her own baggage to deal with, especially since in the series her previous host Jadzia Dax failed in a mission because of the personal relationship between Jadzia and Commander Worf.  But Ezri isn't hostage to her hosts' pasts any more than Julian is hostage to his genetic engineering or his love of espionage.  But will this fledgling relationship between two people be enough to stand against evil and the abyss?  Will Cole die just as Sloan did, and what does he think of his predecessor in the efforts to recruit/manipulate Julian?  And what will happen to Ethan Locken?<br /><br />There's some meat here, but also lovely moments and character development of the ensemble cast.  Kira Nerys struggles with being Attainted, or excommunicated from Bajor because once again--surprise--she tried to fight religious corruption.  And yet her faith stands.  Ro Laren matures further in her new role.  There's a delightful conversation between Ro and Ezri where Ro discusses Captain Jean-Luc Picard and his \\"great cologne\\" as well as his wine snobbery.  Ezri reciprocates with her affection for Ben Sisko, who is still with the Prophets, which Kasidy Sisko, Joseph Sisko, and Jake Sisko try to deal with...although more heartache may be ahead for the Sisko family.<br /><br />Taran'atar helps out Ro, discusses Dominion divinity with Julian, and conveys some of Odo's best lines.<br /><br />Shar Ch'Thane doesn't get as much to do as, say, Commander Elias Vaughn and the mysterious, bitter Prynn Tenmei, especially since Vaughn has some experience with Section 31 himself.<br /><br />All in all, a good read that makes us happy DS9 survives, at least in print.as well as his wine snobbery.

Anthony transmutes a real-life physically challenged girl hit by a drunk driver into a blind goblin girl with chiefly aspriations over her brutish brethren.  Meanwhile, Prince Dolph and his two fiancees, Electra and Princess Nada, set out on a quest that never distracts them from their personal dilemma, but along the way Dolph discovers the true nature of love.  It's fortunate that Nada evolved from a bit part, because she is not the typical cold beautiful princess.  Her friendship with Electra gives her depth, as does her duty to her people...but once again, someone manages to misunderstand an oracle's words.  There are jokes aplenty about summoning the stork, the Adult Conspiracy, and men's stupefaction at women's underwear, but Dolph evolves beyond that, as one would expect of a shapeshifter.<br /><br />Anthony actually has a history of successful loving couples: Millie and Jonathan, Trent and Iris, Bink and Chameleon, Smash and Tandy, Humfrey and Gorgon, and Bria and Esk.	2005-04-27

Rowling prizes for single mom success story, especially since she's stealing daughter Kendall's scummy boyfriend and calling her TV show \\"The Sweet Life\\" her \\"baby\\" in front of a live audience.<br /><br />To paint Martha Stewart as a harridan is to paint Andy's meddling high-society mother Cissy Blevins Kendricks, as your typical rhymes-with-witch-and-rich. Luckily Andy's smarter than that, even when she wants to kill Cissy for meddling in her love life with adorable lawyer Brian Malone and floating theories about Kendall's boyfriend committing murder a la Scott Peterson.  But as Andy says, \\"Despite our bipolar existence, I did love my mother, and she loved me. I'd never doubted that for a minute.\\" Particularly since, unlike Marilee's TV show, Andy is most decidedly Cissy Kendricks' \\"baby.\\"  Classy Cissy is more like Martha than Marilee.  Amid the mystery hijinks, McBride, as in Andy's debut Blue Blood, focuses on a bittersweet exploration the mother-daughter bond.

Ironically, 20+ years later, I have no problem with Alien, Predator, or Aku from \\"Samurai Jack.\\"<br /><br />The Rakas, Archpods, Flying Clera/Angel Birds, and the whole Underground Kingdom nevertheless captivated me once the picture of the Kota Beasts (which looked more vivid on the glossy back cover than on plain paper) ceased to creep me out.<br /><br />The premise was \\"Lost World\\"/\\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" with a morality tale and a worthy message about conflict resolution between the Israeli-Palestinian-esque Rakas and Archpods.  My favorite among these other than the young Archpod Katu (the only girl other than the ultracool Dr. Vivaldi) was the Grand Akpar.  Although I liked the High Raka, Arton, Akpar somehow had more of a forbidding presence.

Also their lifelong enmity with trolls.  In the series the trolls tended to be bumbling and rather stupid, but encyclopedias of magical creatures all support that description, as does Harry Potter.

In fact this book is a great starting place (along with Daniel Goleman's EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE) to avoid court costs and other less legal pitfalls that are just as enchaining--tattered relationships, hostile home and work lives, health problems.<br /><br />The straightforward common-sense journal and writing exercises guide you to think about your anger, and analyze your thinking (much like MIND OVER MOOD.)<br /><br />Actually, this book deals with such a range of emotions and thoughts that anger management should be called emotional management.  \\"Road emotion\\" sounds less entrapping than \\"road rage.\\"  It's okay to have the emotions (even if you might want to change your instinctive emotional habits), just not to act on them, especially behind the wheel of a car.<br /><br />This is not a book you just read once.

I doubt that the world will ever really know the truth about the Jack the Ripper case, especially since in the Green River Killer case, some experts such as former PI Joyce Spizer believe that the killings were the work of more than one murderer.  Spizer specifically names Glen Rogers, \\"The Cross-Country Killer,\\" as a Green River suspect, and also, interestingly, the murderer of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman, a hypothesis supported by Donald Freed's book on the OJ case.  Spizer's assertion is bound to spark as much controversy as Cornwell's, although both experts' opinions should be given more weight because of their experience, Spizer as a PI and Cornwell as a forensic pathologist.<br /><br />Leaving aside the question of whether Cornwell is correct in fingering Walter Sickert as the 19th-century killer, I found her thought processes, her CSI-type investigation (and very human Sherlockian analyses) and her portrait of 19th-century London engrossing.  There is a good deal of poetry in the treatment of a gruesome subject.  Most affecting is the way that the poverty in London emerges as an even greater crime than the Ripper's butchery of women.  Most serial killers follow a profile, with the exception of course of the DC snipers and Aillen Wuornos in which a prostitute, far from being a killer's victim, herself became the attacker.  Serial killers like Glen Rogers do target \\"throwaway women,\\" who sadly still exist today, as alive and well in modern America as in 19th-century London.<br /><br />Cornwell's writing style is sensitive and masterly.  I love the way that she takes an image from a chapter, for example, a dark lantern or three keys, and uses that as the chapter title.  Her writing style is certainly vivid and evocative.<br /><br />Although I couldn't make up my mind whether Cornwell proved Sickert as the Jack the Ripper suspect, for me that wasn't the point.  I enjoyed the book.	2005-01-26

No, this book comments on how shallow women as well as men can be, but it doesn't make Jemima Jones' sisters-in-crime entirely unlikeable.  It's not just a \\"poor me, every woman is horrible\\" litany.  In fact, the stereotypes--the gold-digger, the pretty-ugly stepsisters, the corporate media witch--get a refreshingly human treatment.

Carolyn remarks, \\"I figure he'll be an easy act to follow.\\"  Block, however, isn't.	2004-12-14

The dialogue is as sharp and explosive as the action scenes.  My personal favorite bit, after Bernie and his ladylove go to a Kevin Costner/Michelle Pfeiffer caper...<br /><br />\\"She's (Michelle Pfeiffer) not really pretty, but there's something about her, isn't there?  If i were a man, I'd want to ----- her.\\"<br /><br />\\"Repeatedly.\\"<br /><br />\\"Oh, she does it for you, huh?\\"<br /><br />\\"She's all right.\\"<br /><br />\\"'Repeatedly.'\\"	2004-12-12

Hmmmm...wait until those Greek lawyers get a whiff of that.  Maybe The Hulk isn't gay per se, but the transformation he undergoes (personally I think Howard Dean is The Hulk in disguise) is something everyone can relate to, gay or straight.  I love the way each of these movies, from Mommie Dearest to Norma Rae to All About Eve, can reflect pivotal points in our lives.  I also appreciate that Jason Bergund, one-half of the real-life \\"Will & Grace\\" team that wrote this book, comes out in favor of social responsibility attacking \\"Queer as Folk\\" for only portraying the seamy underbelly of gay life (anonymous sex, drug abuse and endless clubbing aren't something to aspire to in any group).

Ever notice that those are the kids bigger bullies, i.e. pedophiles, target?  \\"Law & Order: SVU\\" has.  So has David Conlin McLeod.<br /><br />Paige Tucker has a miserable life.  Her parents beat each other up and spend her breakfast and ballet money on cigarettes and beer.  Since this is fiction however, McLeod chooses to have Paige pick up a gym leotard rather than a gun.  Paige has dreams.  Trouble is, a mysterious woman named Madame Tatiana has entered her dreams...a woman who was herself abused and now threatens to make Paige's dreams into nightmares.  But Paige has that Erin Brockovich/Tess Durbeyfield/Dorothy Gale spirit, the kind that makes us stand up and cheer for all the picked-on kids.  Even without the exploding gym in CARRIE, this is a great book sensitively written, and on top of all that, a terrific horror read.	2004-12-01

I've always found Letterman a bit too smug and self-consciously hip--except for moments with his mom and the Top Ten Lists.  And for critics who derided Jay Leno's championing of Schwarzenegger, Jay, a dyslexic, has a tendency to promote the guy everyone else laughs at (and who Jay laughs at too, but never mean-spirited).<br /><br />There's plenty of comedy here but what I find most touching is Jay's courtship with his wife Mavis, his relationship with his Italian father and Scottish mother, and the loving way he chronicles his parents' eccentricities.

I've heard that the Dursleys will be cut from the movie, but except for Dudley's Ton-Tongue Toffee incident, they don't play as essential a role as in the first three books.  Cho Chang didn't make it into the last movie so I wonder if she will be cut as well.  Although she gets little to do in this book, she's noteworthy as Harry's love interest.  And all the fans who spotted a romance between Hermione and Ron are right on the money.<br /><br />There's character depth and development here as well as the first character death...the way Rowling starts the book is more ominous than in the first three, giving us a hint of which way the series will go.  Ron's feeligns about Harry's fame get a nice treatment here as well as Hermione's passion for the underdog, in this case house-elves, and Sirius Black plays a terrific role.  Hagrid just gets better and better, and as always the magic of J.K. Rowling's wizarding world is the star.  The book, however, could have been two with all the subplots crammed together.

My father used to do diffrent voices for the characters although he never sounded like Peter Strauss.<br /><br />The book is very, very different from the movie.  Nicodemus emerges as more of a \\"human\\" figure (if that's not an insult considering human portrayals in the book) than the mystical wizard in the film.  Probably in the interest of visuals.  Nicodemus in the book is not as old as Nicodemus in the film (and how did Nicodemus in the film get so aged anyway since the rats had anti-aging injections?)  Jenner in the book emerges as more dimensional than Jenner in the film, but Jenner in the movie needed to be more active in order to create the satisfying dramatic tension.<br /><br />One thing that has not changed is Mrs. Frisby's (Brisby in the movie) devotion to her children.  The description of her mouse-world is moving as she learns new heights of courage and disocvers new friends, including Jeremy the crow, who isn't the comic relief in the book.  Also, Auntie Shrew seems less shrill.  It's impossible to think of the book without considering the movie, but in this case the movie captured the spirit of Mrs. Frisby's quest, the wonder of the Rats of NIMH, and an animal microcosm that never failed to draw me in no matter how many times I read the book.	2004-10-27

Who better to provide it than the Chinese, inventors of tai chi chuan, green tea as a curative, and acupuncture?<br /><br />Qigong, as alternative health expert Dr. Wang Jwing-Ming explains, functions like tai chi chuan or yoga as a way of maintaining longevity, youth, energy and health.  Dr. Yang explains that most practitioners of qigong seek enlightenment, awareness and health through wai dan (physical tai chi type qigong) or nei dan (meditation).<br /><br />Once you have read the half of the book devoted to the nature of qigong, like most Westerners, you're itching to get started. Dr. Yang stresses that qigong is not about fancy moves, but about careful attention. The exercises, like weight or strength training, require several repetitions. The qigong exercises may seem slow. However, for those who are sick and tired of being sick and tired, patience will pay off when you choose to set aside 10-20 minutes a day. The accompanying videotape purports to be another great investment in your health. Dr. Yang skillfully shows us the path to wellness.	2004-10-25

So give the sister Dr. Angela Neal-Barnett's SOOTHE YOUR NERVES.  Let's face it, Black women do have much to worry about, some of which Dr. Neal-Barnett addresses: sexual assault (women of color are twice as likely to be assaulted as white women because they are seen as \\"easy\\" or lesser), violence and violent deaths of loved ones, the \\"acting white\\" stigma, teen pregnancy, discrimination, and now the \\"down low\\" phenomenon, plus the historic strength that they have modeled in a kind of two-for-one Superwoman mold. These are realities that everyone needs to understand, especially women. By reading this book, white, Hispanic and Asian women might confront their own anxieties and their own stereotypes and offer support and help to the sistahs in their lives.<br /><br />However, nowhere does the book mention misogynistic hip-hop or philandering among black men. A Strong Black Woman is supposed to keep the sucker in line. Easier said than done. Nor does the book deal, except in mentioning not being able to pay for psychiatric treatment, the effect that poverty has, let alone single motherhood. Perhaps Dr. Neal-Barnett is trying to lift up the Black woman from stereotypes by portraying successful women as suffering from compulsions, anxiety, fear, and the ultimate stereotype of the Strong Black Woman, popularized in the media. She does this most effectively by portraying Black men as loving partners with frustrations of their own in dealing with their anxious mates, although not the self-destructiveness in Black men.<br /><br />However, treating Black women and Black men as victims is as destructive as the Superwoman myth (are you listening, Jesse Jackson?)  This sensitive, intelligent treatment of a complex subject deserves to be read and reread.	2004-10-25

McLain's prose is a long-overdue love letter to her wry, spunky, strong personality, the children and families rebelliously proud of their differences in mainstream America, the love coming from real parenting such as McLain's father's ex-wife Donna, McLain's churchgoing Granny, and the kindly Fredericksons, a foster family for the McLain girls, the forgotten Americana of the 1960's and 1970's, the heartbreak of teenage girls looking for love in sexual embraces, and most of all, the unbreakable bond between McLain and her sisters, Penny and Teresa, who are as fascinating as she is.<br /><br />Even McLain's absent mother, who returns miraculously out of the blue, as often happens in real life, gets sympathetic treatment.

Crompton and Kressner do not make light of peer pressure, or fail to note that the very rich and the very poor of today's youth are the most at risk to become abusers, or shrink from advising parents to \\"back off\\" and accept the relationship. The personal safety plan for daughters in abusive relationships, the safety plan for daughters who have left the relationship, the ingenious suggestion of a \\"code word\\" signaling danger, are useful tools. The coda of Crompton confronting Mark Smith in prison serves as a poignant reminder and incentive for all parents of teenage girls to read and share this book with their \\"Beautys.\\"	2004-10-25

Fennell provides a step-by-step guide to training a new dog, whether puppy or adult, in the Amichien Bonding method, which is remarkably simple although counterintuitive for many pet owners.<br /><br />It's not easy to change a lifetime of thinking and behaving a certain way toward dogs, as Fennell's stories of dog owners applying her method demonstrate.

Just consider Sophia Loren. Do you know why she looks so fabulous? In part, it's all that marinara sauce, cooked naturally in a well-stocked kitchen and eaten with friends and family in the boisterous Italian tradition of family and special places for eating (which also knocks years off your RealAge). Eating 10 tablespoons of tomato sauce per week, rich in the new hot ingredient, lycopene, makes your RealAge 1.9 years younger (55-year-old male) or 0.7 years younger (55-year-old female)-Mamma Mia! And if you're an adult male of 55, buy some nuts and eat an ounce a day (3.3 years off your RealAge.)<br /><br />This is no Big Mac read.

Red Hatter founder, Red Hat Society author and Queen Mother Sue Ellen Cooper and her crimson chapeau sisters, eschew the notion of Robert's Rules of Order. This delightful book introduces us to Ruby RedHat, who acts as gleeful mascot for the entire Red Hat Society, founded by Cooper. The whole thing has a great \\"Lifetime\\" ring, without man-bashing since several husbands, fathers, sons, and even one polite five-year-old boy fully support red Hats in all their red, red, and red glory!<br /><br />There's a definite sisterhood and joie de vivre in the way the Red Hatters describe their fundamentals--emphasis on the \\"fun\\"--and the touching way they support each other through life's ups and downs (navigated, no doubt, in a red and purple balloon).<br /><br />At a time when so-called role models get younger and sillier, the Red Hat Society shows us that to be older and sillier is better...because you've earned it.

Interestingly, Dr. Kovacs argues against a dichotomy of thought that cut off the instinctive and dream knowledge as ruthlessly as Puritans arrested women for being witches. She condemns our society's dismissal of dreams and visions such as the prophetic symbolic dreams Dr. Kov&aacute;cs, Istvan and Pisti's beloved girlfriend Jenny experience before and after his death. The dream imagery guided Dr. Kov&aacute;cs toward stunning insights about the meaning of death.  Simply put, Dr. Kovacs argues that there is nothing but life, and that Western civilization's ignorance of that truth has caused a breakdown in our society.<br /><br />As we begin to search for understanding of the death and horror of September 11, Dr. Kov&aacute;cs loving insights, which offer an alternative to our worldview although not a prescription for transformation, deserve to be heard, so that a new creativity of thought and being can emerge.	2004-10-25

From the Oscar-nominated films The Twilight Samurai and Tom Cruise's The Last Samurai to anime marital arts sagas and the hit Emmy-winning Cartoon Network series, Samurai Jack, the robed, inscrutable, unstoppable warriors conquer our hearts with their martial arts and their dignity. The illustration of a black-robed Japanese gentlemen seated in a meditation pose with a katana by his side, one in his lap, sets the tone for Kendo and Kenjitsu practitioner Darrell Max Craig. Although Craig, like so many martial arts devotees, is a gai-jin (foreigner), he displays a reverence and knowledge of Japanese culture, samurai in particular, that is to be respected and admired. Craig goes into great detail about the katas, combat, clothing, equipment, and most of all, the swords of his art. He writes of the details with the same intricate deftness of a skilled samurai dueling with an adversary, and his strokes of the keyboard baffle and enlighten us as much as the strokes of the katana, or the other sword Craig introduces us to, the shinai.<br /><br />Those readers who, like this reviewer, have not read Craig's previous book, The Heart of Kendo, and are not familiar with Kendo and Kenjitsu, may find the details difficult to master. This is not a casual read, but if you truly desire to learn martial arts, or at least collect Japanese swords, a pastime to which Craig devotes the last two chapters (perhaps recognizing, wisely, that some of his audience for the book may be Japanophiles and collectors), The Way of Kendo and Kenjitsu is a worthy place to start.	2004-10-25

Certainly, like Kevin Costner, his output has been eclectic and iconoclastic. Amburn makes the point that Beatty, like a Don Juan Forrest Gump, inserted himself into the tumult of the New Hollywood era, the era of Pacino, Nicholson, and Roman Polanski. The insight into politics and into actors entering politics, seems particularly timely in the wake of Hollywood (brain trust) protests against the Iraq war and Arnold Schwarzenegger's successful gubernatorial run.<br /><br />Schwarzenegger is one of the many names and figures striking bold poses, vogueing like Beatty conquest Madonna, in Ellis Amburn's prose, which reads like a \\"Beatty's Complaint\\" crossed with 1001 NIGHTS AT THE MOVIES, mixed in with Scott Thorson's LIFE WITH LIBERACE, which portrays a hypersexual performer who never quite grew up (though unlike Beatty, Liberace had little to do with politics or social issues).<br /><br />Never content to name-drop, Amburn skillfully probes, with love, exasperation, a certain detachment, and fascination, the inner life of an aging Lothario whose film career and political carrer haves been as mercurial as his love life. Interestingly, Beatty's lasting achievements, \\"Reds,\\" \\"Shampoo,\\" and \\"Bonnie and Clyde,\\" parallel his most lasting relationships, specifically with Julie Christie and Annette Bening, as well as his male friendships, specifically with Jack Nicholson (his relationships with gay filmmakers make an intriguing twist.)

Ballmer contains multitudes.\\" This observation in the introduction to Bad Boy Ballmer leads respected investigative journalist Fredric Alan Maxwell to conclude his unauthorized biography/expose of Microsoft head honcho Steven Anthony Ballmer, and truth be told, Microsoft itself, with \\"Steve Ballmer can remind you of many people.\\" This seems to be his prevailing message along with \\"Microsoft is bad!\\"<br /><br />Granted, Microsoft's misdeeds have been made public and their ruthless corporate strategies painstakingly if not gleefully reported by the media.  A lot like Martha.  But few companies have created such wealth or had more lasting influence on our lives, and thus Ballmer, who is Microsoft, deserves attention.<br /><br />While \\"Monkey Boy\\" Ballmer, as portrayed by Maxwell, is passionless (he's committed to cancer research and was devastated over the deaths of his beloved parents, Fred and Bea), he self-contradicts, like Walt Whitman, and is a chameleon.  Perhaps this is why Maxwell concludes by saying, anticlimactically, \\"Steve Ballmer can remind you of many people.\\"<br /><br />In this intricate as the integrated circuit biography, there are nuggets of gold underneath, such as the ironic twist that Fred Ballmer helped prosecute the Nuremburg trials under Microsoft antitrust case judge Thomas Penfield Jackson. Michigan and Seattle history, as well as Jewish identity (Ballmer is Jewish) and its contribution to Ballmer's psychology give the book that touch of individuality that a portrait of one of the highest-paid American employees, and one of its most controversial companies, deserves.	2004-10-25

The next thing you know, there's a police officer in your face, yelling at you. \\"He started it\\" makes you sound like your two kids in the back, who along with your spouse think this is an episode of \\"COPS\\" gone wrong.<br /><br />Or you could just listen to the presidential debates and then send the candidates this book.  Then get rid of the pundits and send in George Thompson, Verbal Judo expert, and Jerry B. Jenkins, who refines this communication samurai's sword into a mighty pen. The result: a useful book on communication as a martial arts form.  Thompson and Jenkins add several acronym communications formulas and the use of \\"strip phrases\\" such as \\"'preciate that, oyesss, understan' that.\\"<br /><br />Why should I bother to shove my ego out of the way and empathize with the customers/kids/cops/parents that make my life difficult? Thompson and Jenkins make it clear that difficult people are a way of life. Or to summarize in concrete terms, you have a choice to yell \\"He started it\\" at the police officer instead of saying, \\"Sir, here is what happened.\\"<br /><br />Read this book and you can spare us more arrests, more divorces, more tension, and more campaign gaffes replayed endlessly.	2004-10-25

Drinking in this book on wine will make you feel tipsy without the consequences. As Kushner says in the section Everything I Know I Learned from Drinking Wine: A loaded person is more dangerous than a loaded gun. That said, a glass or two of young Beaujolias or White Zin goes perfectly with this book.<br /><br />Kushner swirls his own witticisms, his musings on what would happen if famous authors wrote about wine (especially funny are Joan Rivers on Chablis and Dr. Seuss on Champagne: \\"I do not like it / Cham I am / I do not like / That pagne of cham\\"), trivia, trivia quizzes and humorous quizzes, and his real-life clips of studies on the mental benefits of drinking wine with quips and quotes from the drunk and the famous.<br /><br />There's plenty of silliness in a glass of wine, and Kushner saves most of his wickedness for the pretentious tasters, the wine connoisseurs and the sommeliers (that's wine servers for the uninitiated).<br /><br />New Yorker cartoons, like the heady aroma of a newly opened bottle of Napa Valley wine, add a delicious flavor to this humorous collection.	2004-10-25

There's even a love story.  Ian seems to be Soledad's salvation from a life of hatred, but pulls the rug out from under her in a twist well-foreshadowed in the plot, but as stunning as the final wrinkle in The Ring.<br /><br />Soledad's prejudice, coming from a black heroine, is an intriguing social commentary. The ending, while true to Soledad's character, will provoke commentary and debate, as any work of speculative fiction should.	2004-10-25

Merlin still loves Nimue, Nimue betrays him, and there is a dark enchantress, priestess of the Old Ways, with a foul attitude who sees Merlin and Nimue as nothing more than pawns.<br /><br />The difference is, Morgan Le Fay, often called Morganna as she is in Catherine Anne Collins' mystical Arthurian-meets-modern fantasy romance, comes between Merlin and Nimue out of hatred and power lust, not out of dedication to the Old Ways.  Morganna figures, hey, the Old Ways got her mother pregnant with the future King of England.  And she just hates her mother's dedication to Christianity.<br /><br />Centuries later, Tamara has the same battle with her mother Diana, who insists Tamara is descended from Nimue, something Tamara doesn't want to hear after spending a childhood being teased about her \\"witch\\" mother and growing up without a father. Trouble is, she meets Gavin, a firm believer in magic.  Gavin and Tamara--Merlin and Nimue's descendants--can't resist their magical attraction that leads them to a climactic showdown.<br /><br />Will ancient curses be broken?

The terrorist attack on September 11, 2001 may have destroyed Jacques Lowe's negatives of the Kennedy family, but not the photographs or the brilliance evident in the camera capturing this shining light that once was Camelot. On the fortieth anniversary of the assassination, which is astutely, not for the first time, linked with September 11, 2001 as a turning point and a loss of innocence in our country's history, the magic of the Kennedys portrayed through Jacques Lowe's wise, perceptive lens makes us mourn for all we've lost.<br /><br />Modern pundits and social critics might decry our fascination with the Kennedys, but their influence is felt strongly, especially now in Maria Shriver and hubby Ah-nold, a fierce Republican but a believer in the service to God and country that JFK practiced.  You can't ignore Jack and Jackie keeping company with Premier Nikita Khrushchev, or Kennedy shaking hands with coal miners. Lowe's close-ups of the miners illuminate the dignity and strength of these men.<br /><br />The Kennedys romp through a time of change in social, personal and political home movies. Particularly striking are the unguarded JFK moments, such as the photo of JFK thinking with a cigar (no Clinton jokes, please), or the sequence and closeup illustrating Kennedy's distress over hearing of Prime minister of Congo Patrice Lumumba's murder. We see the Kennedys, and they are us, with the added weight of John-John's salute.  The intimacy lends more depth of history to this important, moving book.	2004-10-25

Her incisive arguments cover topics as diverse as Starbucks, religious objections to makeup, Martha (no last name needed), and Afghani women painting fingernails after the defeat of the Taliban.

It's not as if you can always count on partisan bickering, campaign finance shockers, political scandal, racist senators' controversies, and Ted Kennedy showing up soused...oh wait a minute, yes, you can. But apart from Teddy, as P.J. O'Rourke says, \\"the real problem is that government is boring.\\"  Just ask anyone who watched the recent debates.<br /><br />Fortunately, Brad Meltzer's The Zero Game, which opens with the O'Rourke witticism, not only might get people watching C-SPAN again, it might even drive the apathetic voters who don't know John Kerry from Jim Carrey (here's a tip: even if they did once have the same bad hair, Carrey's funnier) to turn off the Super Bowl and care what their representatives are doing.<br /><br />However, as Monica Lewinsky proved, you also have to watch those interns. And as Harris Sandler discovers, defending betting on congressional legislation won't work, because it's not just a game...and yet, in a cruel irony, it is.  Sandler has to learn to get real and grow up.  You can bet on seventeen-year-old Senate page Viv Parker, who's got plenty of soul and as much kick as Jennifer Garner, to help Harris.  Let's get down to Viv-ness!<br /><br />Brad Meltzer is wonderful, and it's no wonder his new show \\"Jack & Bobby\\" is a hit, with the same soul as THE ZERO GAME.	2004-10-24

Turns out, Eddie did quite a bit of wagering when she and Anthony played together. Anthony, who is, of course, smitten with Edwina, bets her that she can't double her subscriptions in three months. If she can, she'll own the magazine her aunt started as an amusing fashionable and gossip rag. For independent Edwina, this wager is too good to resist.<br /><br />  Anthony's new magazine, The Ladies' Fashionable Cabinet, is the Marie Claire or Vanity Fair of its day, minus the fashion reports. Edwina labors under the illusion that so many of today's feminists still do: you can't be into the latest high-society or haut ton fashion and still write reviews on Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley's A Vindication of the Rights of Women. Fortunately, Anthony, who's feeling the need to break out of his role of good-for-nothing privileged son, actively tries to help Edwina---not without a few wagers of course---for example, appointing as her new editor Flora Gallagher, the Heidi Fleiss of the day. The notorious courtesan becomes Edwina's ally and best friend as Edwina and Tony head toward the typical Regency ravishment...except Edwina seduces Tony!<br /><br />The inevitable boy-loses-girl moment is a ridiculous falling-out between Anthony and Edwina just before the hero proves his love and the heroine realizes her pride (and prejudice) got in the way.  Nevertheless, this predictable-but-fun romp into publishing and steamy romance contains a little gem of wisdom on the merits of both beauty and brains.	2004-10-24

You raise them to be Vera Wang-wearing debs in Dallas society, handpick them to star in charity fashion shows, and arrange blind dates with Ph.D.s who play the pipe organ for the Pope. And what do they do? They don lavender hot pants and whoop it up at a den of iniquity called Jugs, where guys go who, in the words of Mothers Against Pornography ringleader Peggy Martin, \\"get their ideas about relationships from dirty magazines, from strip joints,\\" and apparently, from Janet Jackson too.  Just ask Cissy Blevins Kendricks. The charity-loving smooth-talking secretly softhearted matron is the spiritual sister to Kitty Montgomery of \\"Dharma and Greg,\\" right down to the Ferragamo shoes.<br /><br />Cissy's hot pants-wearing daughter, artist and Web designer Andrea, has more sense than Dharma but as great a knack for trouble. The plot centers on Andrea's undercover activities at the Hooters-type joint Jugs, where Andrea's \\"scholarship girl\\" friend, single mom Molly O'Brien, supposedly killed Larry Flynt wannabe Bud Hartman.<br /><br />The real heart of the story is Andrea's complex relationship with Cissy. Blue blood really is thicker than sparkling water. It would be easy to peg Cissy as just another snobby society matron, and although there's plenty of social satire here, Susan McBride never sacrifices character or the bittersweet warmth of the mother-daughter relationship.

This is appropriate, since Tropic of Night does for Cuba, Africa, anthropology, and the politics of race and religion what Miller did for Cole Porter-era Bohemian Paris.<br /><br />What's the bad news? Michael Gruber tries to take a leaf from his sorcerer subjects and tries verbal and character slight-of-hand to see how many times he can sneak in racial commentary bordering on unintentional self-parody. Liberal whites have white guilt. Upper-class Cubans look down on Cubans who look like they might fix the transmission on the professor's Lexus.  Still, there has to be one flaw in this big bad voodoo diamond of a mystery.  Like the illusions created by dark sorcery, nothing is what it seems in this mystery. Jane Doe, the heroine, does wicked aikido. Jimmy Paz, the hunky detective hero (who discovers his mother, Margarita Paz, is actually a practitioner of the Cuban religion Santeria recently featured on an episode of TV's Law & Order: Special Victims Unit), and Jane don't end up together. Finally, Jimmy, like the reader, becomes a believer in magic.<br /><br />This is also a terrific exploration of the subcultures of Miami, Florida.	2004-10-24

And villains have come a long way since the mustache-twirling melodrama maniacs. They may even be spymasters for British Intelligence who have none of Bond's sensuality or M's ethics, but plenty of flaws cloaked in duty to king and country. Lord Tristram Wheaton intends for Lord Justin Barclay to carry out a mission vital to homeland security. Trouble is, Justin has to kill a woman suspected, like her father, of being a traitor to the British crown. However, Justin starts to fall for the lady as romance turns Hitchockian in the best \\"Notorious\\" sense, with hero and heroine guilty over divided loyalties and conflicts of the heart.<br /><br />The novel's heroine and spy target Lady Evelyn Amherst is as emotionally guarded and scarred as Ingrid Bergman-at least when it comes to the subject of love or marriage.<br /><br />Despite a determination to finish her murdered father's mysterious last mission, she feels guilt over deceiving while lusting after Justin, who she seduces in marked contrast to yesteryear's frightened breathless passive miss submitting to the hero's wicked desires despite herself.<br /><br />Evelyn and Justin's emotional and suspenseful journey is no less bold, taking them through tangled loyalties, discoveries of each other's true mission.

Or does she?<br /><br />It seems that while some pot growers insist on stonewalling Tempe, citizens of the small community where she lives and enforces the law insist that Hutch is yet another man of the cloth gone bad. Could gentle, loving Hutch, who disapproves of Tempe's association with Native American shamanism, expose himself to schoolchildren? Tempe doesn't think so, but her son Blair, a hotheaded firefighter, does. More to the point, even her boss suspects Hutch. Where's a peace pipe or a rain dance when you need one?<br /><br />What else could go wrong? One of the marijuana farmers turns up dead, and to top it all off, she's actually the missing granddaughter of Tempe's friend Joe Seaberry, a retired cop.<br /><br />Fortunately, Tempe's multiple roles, as Yanduchi-born woman, wife, mother, and deputy, give her multiple insights and eyes as powerful as the owl that foretells death among her people. Also, at the end of the day, she has a strong marriage, held together by faith and true love.<br /><br />Author Marilyn Meredith continues to be a strong voice for the Christian faith as well as for women in fiction, particularly female law enforcement officers rain-dancing as fast as they can to break the glass ceiling.

Those expecting the Disney version will be disappointed, but in the pages of language embroidered like a tapestry in Uffizi Palace, readers will find that the classic tale takes on a new spiritual beauty.<br /><br />Lucrezia Borgia resents Bianca de Nevada/Snow White for stealing away Lucrezia's brother's affections and threatening Lucrezia's power base in the cutthroat courts of Italy. Lucrezia and her brother Cesare become obsessed with immortality, specifically with a sprig of the Tree of Immortality from the Garden of Eden. The quest for the sprig, which has produced three apples like the one that tempted Adam and Eve, falls to Vicente de Nevada, Bianca's beloved father, to complete. Cesare and Lucrezia send him away from the safe haven of his home Montefiore. While he is gone, Bianca, who he has sheltered, slowly grows into a woman...and as in the original tale, the seven dwarves rescue Bianca after Lucrezia orders her taken out into the woods and killed.

Imagine looking out your window and seeing the bloody body of a young woman on your front lawn.<br /><br />This is the powder keg that ignites former L.A. dweller Mike Romano's first novel, a mystery set in the glamour of Palm Springs. Romano, fascinated by the mystique of the area even before he moved there, penned this tale of Ted Ross, a writer who quickly finds himself the prime suspect in the girl's murder, particularly when he discovers that the victim is Kim Sheppard, a wise, younger waitress at Hamburger Hamlet. Ted, a nice guy (even his ex-wife is friends with him) with a quick wit, mourns lost opportunities with Kim, who he was attracted to but afraid to approach. Seeing Kim's body in the morgue, Ted begins to wish that wrestling with the blank page and his obnoxious, hyper agent Sam's insistent phone calls were his only concern...especially when another body winds up on his lawn and the police, who already believe he's Kim's killer, turn up the heat to a blistering Palm Springs 120 degrees.<br /><br />This book has it all...Mafia, danger, a Steve McQueen-type confrontation in the desert, even a love story.

When people around married but roving-handed conference honoree Dr. Hubert Freundlich start dying, it's up to the much-suspected much-shot-at Carrie (whose scarf puts her under suspicion) to unravel the mystery on the Vermont ski slopes. In true amateur-detective fashion, Carrie proves she's earned her PhD (Plucky Heroine Degree) by uncovering a killer you only begin to suspect the second half of the book. The killer's motives are real, human and even understandable, but still despicable.<br /><br />The secret is truly juicy, but plays second fiddle to Carrie and her engaging, endearing personality, her devotion to her children, her sparkling commentary, and her marriage dilemma with sexy-but-flawed cop Ted Brodsky, who tries to protect her despite herself.

It is an apocalyptic fantasy pitting the old gods against the gods of the Digital Age. It is a tale of redemption (or is it?) for the Everyman hero, Shadow, as well as for America. It takes us through many mythologies such as Native American (Don't know Wisakedjak? You will!), Norse (The villain, Mr. Wednesday, is purportedly Wotan, as in Odin, a favorite in Gaiman's Sandman odysseys), and modern pseudo-mythologies such as media, Internet and television.<br /><br />And although you may be wondering at page 400 where it's going, just let yourself get lost in Gaiman's playful, emotional prose and his American Gods.	2004-10-24

Richard North Patterson's The Dark Lady covered the soulful gritty intrigue of Steelton, Pennsylvania. Sarah Strohmeyer's comic mystery introduces us to Slagville and Lehigh, to the coal miners, the hairdressers, the old Nag 'n Feed matrons, the conspiracy theorists, the comfort food (hoagies and Entenmann's rule), the batty academics, the small-town-girl makes good reporters, the small-town police chiefs, the union men, and the spoiled-brat Kenneth Lay-type coal bosses. Spend a few days in places like Conneaut Lake and Sharon, PA and you'll understand.  Or you could just read about the mystery misadventures of Bubbles.<br /><br />Bubbles, who only learned how to peroxide her hair and roll cigarettes in high school, has the common-sense wisdom and love of fashion of Princess Diana, enshrined forever in the hearts of the working-class American woman, the muckraking of Michael Moore (except she's funnier and dresses better), the proletariat loyalties, and the stubborn determination and sense of right and wrong that crack the case. The only unbelievable note is Steve Stiletto's vow of chastity. You have as much chance of resisting the ebullient Bubbles as she has of giving up hoagies.	2004-10-24

J.D. Robb, take a back seat, again as usual, to Roberts' ever-evolving characters. Like the tough, courageous, makeup-scorning New York-loving culturally deprived but brilliantly wise Eve, the reader has difficulty selecting a favorite from Roberts' list of \\"suspects\\": the stalwart, always-hungry Officer Delia Peabody, Eve's sidekick, fretting over the detectives' exam; Peabody's main squeeze, the ultimate computer geek Detective Ian McNab, whose relationship with Peabody Eve has at last (reluctantly) accepted; Charles Monroe, the smooth-talking but heart-of-gold LC (that's high-class legal prostitute) dating Eve's doctor friend after a tense love triangle with Peabody and McNab; Mavis Freestone, Eve's pregnant but untamed friend; Dr. Charlotte Mira, the razor-sharp-within-velvet-gloves New York police (NYPSD) psychologist who horrifies Eve by inviting her to a family barbecue; Eve's mother and father, who would make Susan Smith's blood run cold, glimpsed in Eve's nightmares; and Roarke, Eve's wealthy, romantic, utterly sexy (his attempt at a private barbecue is adorably botched) husband who, like her, emerged from a rough childhood as a productive if not always law-abiding citizen.<br /><br />Motherhood and family, including the extended family Eve has put together (her relationships with Peabody, Roarke and Mira in particular become richer), form the heart of this thriller, combined with the sharp police work, moral compass and hot loving sex readers have come to expect.	2004-10-24

Rotten kids.  They have the sense not to listen to professors who haven't had a thing published since college themselves.  Writers like Ryan Mayers produce work that, while flawed with first-time-itis, they still produce work that should shame James Patterson or the pabulum that passes for most Hollywood blockbusters.<br /><br />Ryan Mayers delivers the most truly original mystery I've read this year. Somebody give this young \\"poor college student studying math\\" (yes, math) \\"and education,\\" whose own bio states his wish to \\"eventually be able to warp the minds of the next generation as a teacher,\\" a MacArthur Fellowship.  He can take traditional nursery rhymes such as Old Mother Hubbard and turn the good bare-cupboard lady into the Heidi Fleiss of the imaginary parallel-Earth world of Breco.  He spins the straw of the traditional good cop mourning the loss of partner (Humpty Dumpty) while stopping an assassination plot against the king into the gold of something original.  That's talent.  Mayers' wicked, fresh imagination makes this edgy definitely-not-for-kids bedtime story succeed.	2004-10-24

The result: a tale of tolerance, love and courage, intermingled with the bonds of a family estranged by one man's quest to learn from aliens, in this case Earthers.  Why does everyone hate Earth? Is Earth as a whole \\"the ugly American\\"?<br /><br />When the Elosians' version of the Taliban, the Berloff, kidnap several Earthers to supplant their dwindling population, Locom, the Saddam-like Berloff leader, finds himself bested by Jamie MacGivens, an Earth girl who's not easy and whose boyfriend slept with her best friend all because Jamie was spending a tad too much time caring for her sick mother. Fortunately, Tony Stone, a guy crazy in love with his pregnant wife, proves to Jamie that not all men are jerks...not all Earth-men, anyway.

Who doesn't love A Christmas Carol as well as the myriad movies and retellings it has spawned (the best being the 1980s version with, ahem, George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge, \\"Mickey's Christmas Carol\\" and Patrick Stewart's one-man show)? But did you wonder if Ebenezer was, to Tiny Tim, a \\"second father\\"? What happened to Bob Cratchit...and to Tiny Tim himself?<br /><br />Louis Bayard's novel Mr. Timothy is not the Cliff's Notes version of literature but a worthy successor to Dickens, with the same superb special touch for arousing suspense and horror. Ghosts follow young Tiny Tim, now grown into Mr. Timothy Cratchit, specifically a young girl as well as venerable old Bob.  An international child-bride kidnapping plot helps Timothy grow beyond the child who owed everything to Ebenezer Scrooge, but we still can hear him say, \\"God bless us, every one!\\"  The characters are more flawed and likeable than Dickensian models, the villains are the epitome of evil, and we get to see Tiny Tim become \\"Not so tiny any more.\\"	2004-10-24

Rhythm and blues takes its time, and unlike rap, it sings about real things. As fictional blues legend JoJo says, \\"Rap doesn't elevate us...Money, money, money. Trashy women. That's not music. Glorifies people being ignorant. Blues is music.\\"<br /><br />Tell it to fifteen-year-old rapper named Alias, who started life abandoned by his mother, a drug addict and prostitute and got a dose of reality when his friends conned him. When you come from nothing, become a millionaire with a lakefront mansion in your teens, then have respect, women, money, song and fame yanked away from you because of cross-town rivals, you sing the why-me blues.<br /><br />JoJo and Ace Atkins's hero, Nick Travers, aren't listening. The old man, who sits nightly drinking beer on his porch with his wife Loretta, waxes cautionary about rap: \\"That music is against God. Makes thugs into heroes, women into things, and money above all.\\"<br /><br />This is not just a mystery.  Atkins makes this novel about rap sound like a 1930's blues song mourning popular culture, yet acknowledging its siren's smile of groups such as Alias that lures children, rappers and the rap culture are elevated into understanding as opposed to glorification.  This mystery sings truth to power.	2004-10-24

That poison takes shape in Carly's life-mate Ardis Coleman, or more accurately, Gwen Lindstrom, whose lesbian nature presumably led her to run from Matt after he pressured her to have children. The irony: Ardis has supposedly given birth to a daughter, Natalie, after an affair that betrayed Carly...and Ardis has stolen Natalie, forcing Matt and Carly to join forces and find the woman they yearn to confront.  Marcia Muller peels away the layers of the onion to give us a tale of complexity, subtlety and depth.<br /><br />My one complaint is that Carly pretty much takes over, leaving us to wonder about Matt, who we care about equally, even a little bit more.	2004-10-24

Somehow, chasing down politicians fighting to rule a dying industrial town, fretting over your ex getting married, being reminded by a TV rival that you've taken a step down in your career, and having to deal with an officious editor pale in comparison to discovering the truth behind the death of your competitor, who could have been your friend if you weren't busy watching the byline.  An interesting commentary on professional ego especially in the wake of the New York Times and CBS scandals.<br /><br />When Eddie's fellow reporter Danny Nowlin is found in the local canal, it's only a matter of time before Eddie's refusal to let sleeping dogs lie lands him in the same canal. It also introduces him to two \\"Trainspotting\\"-like junkies, Leo and Gabrielle, who rescue him and remind him why he became a reporter. Unfortunately, the officious Franklin Keyes \\"spikes\\" the story Eddie lands, when he's not busy burying any coverage of Danny Nowlin's death and other stories that might cause voters to lose faith in the incumbents for the upcoming city elections. The Lowell Empire has a vested interest in keeping the status quo.

The problem is, Grayson Finley kisses her senseless the first time she rescues him from James Ardmore, who hates him desperately and has imposed a postponed death sentence  in exchange for giving Maggie, Grayson's daughter by Sara, the woman Grayson and James both loved, safe passage from the islands. In addition, James has kidnapped the exiled French king, whom Grayson is trying to find for the British Admiralty, in exchange for the pardon of his pirate crimes.<br /><br />Passions and longings of the heart drive this sensual, seaworthy romp. Forget about the bodice-ripping. The main action is the conflict between heads and hearts in this marriage comedy that, as so many romances do, models itself well on Jane Austen. Ashley displays sense and sensibility in portraying her characters' motivations and feelings, and the characters themselves have emotional depth. Grayson has compassion and understanding for James Ardmore's hatred; Alexandra recognizes that her rashness led to her first unhappy marriage, but that an American Bandstand-type list for judging a mate is hardly a better approach. The steamy sex scenes are just the topper. Yo ho, a pirate's life for me!	2004-10-24

Dolly Madison \\"Maddy\\" Sprowls, who tends the \\"morgue,\\" the archives of the Hannawa Herald-Union, hates being called Morgue Mama...but this doesn't stop the bold Aubrey from crawling into Morgue Mama's heart with the words, \\"Maddy, I don't think Sissy James did it.\\"<br /><br />Thus begins the adventure for an unlikely crime duo.  Their chemistry is intriguing if flawed since Aubrey's too blinded by ambition and youth to see the depths of like Maddy has seen.  Still, youth and age and partners in crime make an irresistible combo.  The details of Sissy's guilt or innocence, as well as the murder of Jim Bakker-type preacher Buddy Wing, pale next to the timeless clash of crusty but soft-as-meatloaf and mashed potatoes Maddy and young dynamo Aubrey, who seems indifferent to the fate of Dale Marabout, her competition in the crime beat reporter stakes. Yep, youth and great legs in trousers always win over seniority and sagacity...or do they?<br /><br />Maddy, like the reader, can't avoid Aubrey's allure.

This is a new twist on the \\"cozy mystery\\" sub-genre. The idea of small, respectable towns having deadly secrets is not new, nor is the plucky ex-New York journalist uncovering buried scandals---darn those meddling kids! In this case, darn small-town paper reporter Tori Miracle, who uncovers a literal skeleton in the closet while she's assigned to write about the (fictional) town of Lickin Creek's stately homes for the June house tour. Tori's best friend tests the bonds of friendship by convincing Tori, who's been responsible for the death of a beloved senator, among other mishaps, to keep quiet about the mysterious skeleton until after the house tour is over.<br /><br />Make no bones about it: The skeleton is to Tori and the town of Lickin Creek what the Elephant Man's bones were to Michael Jackson. Speaking of Jacko, the skeleton in the closet, one half of a local Romeo-and-Juliet legend, resembles the Gloved One more than a lovelorn bridegroom. The community pillars of Lickin Creek who want to preserve the legend don't appreciate Tori poking into their business.  Nor do the murderers...and several people, from an itinerant preacher to an elderly Paul Newman type trying to romance Tori (to distract her?), attempt to protect this lovable meddler.<br /><br />This book, meandering through an eccentric, likable cast of characters, is not for readers who like trim, fast-paced mysteries of the James Patterson kind. The pace of the plot slows in places, but the setting's quirks and Tori's talent for trouble spice up the tale. Several Lickin Creek recipes complete the cozy, homey atmosphere.	2004-10-24

Marcus, formerly a man acquainted with the seamy side of life that old girlfriend Chrloris represents, now finds himself going up against it again when he uncovers evidence that Verovolcus' death may be linked to organized crime through a wimp of a mob boss whom Tony Soprano would whack on the spot. Not only that, the wimp boss in question has a personal grudge against hero and Falco friend L.

Travel back to the Depression, where in Love for Sale people actually seem to live richer lives than in the modern prosperous era. Without glamorizing the hard times of the past, this cozy mystery, starring a brother and sister team, makes us long for the days of white gloves, croquet, and milk delivered to the door.<br /><br />But milk isn't all Lily and Robert Brewster find on the doorstep of the manor their late great-uncle left them. In true cozy mystery form, the unsuspecting amateur detectives discover a missing grade school teacher, uncover Road to Perdition-style mob activity as well as political conspiracy aimed at President Roosevelt's election (and you thought the President Bush-Senator Kerry grudge match was nasty), and figure out who killed Charles Pottinger (a.k.a. the radio preacher Brother Goodheart) in their very house. Seems there was more than Bible-thumping going on among the Reverend and his friends, who include the bizarre Nobby Hazard (reminiscent of Renfrew in Dracula, minus the vermin eating). Who would want to kill Brother Goodheart? How about his illegitimate son, who is tossed out as an interesting, if predictable, red herring that never goes anywhere and remains a loose end? Why do we detect the hint of a lesbian quarrel in the disappearance of the schoolteacher?<br /><br />And why question any of these things?  Thanks to Jill Churchill's vivid tale of a bygone era, we can enjoy genteel times again without the Depression and with the whodunit. Much grace and favor to Jill Churchill.	2004-10-24

His largest commitment in life is to his former lover Peter, dying of AIDS.  Until he meets younger married architect Julien, whose lack of known-last-name typifies his character.

Her opera conductor husband is a closet gay, and while traveling in Italy with her two young children Julian and Regina, she visits Florence, a.k.a Fiorenza or Firenze, and has a liberating affair with a young Florentine Romeo named Carlo. Every summer she leaves the children with their father for three weeks and has exotic voyages into the territory of amore and amour in France, Italy, and Switzerland, for a start. This reader thinks: Judge not, lest ye be judged.  The heroine's marriage suffers a blow because of the husband's closet homosexuality-a subtle comment on our society's invasive tendency to control people's private loves.<br /><br />Erica Miner's heroine strives to be a good mother, and this is reflected in the tolerant attitudes of the children during the heroine's five life stages: young married mother, new divorc&eacute;e, mature mother, single mother yearning for a commitment, and free-spirited mother of a teenage daughter.  The novel is an exercise in freedom and unexplored frontiers, immersing us in foreign lands and languages, reminding us, post-9/11, that life without discovery and emotional complexity is no life at all.	2004-10-23

Although Eden Found is set mainly in 1985, its events have great resonance post-9/11 and during the ongoing War on Terror, as well as the continued breakdown of negotiation between the Israelis and the Palestinians. The Israeli-Palestinian \\"roadmap to peace,\\" in this intriguing, inventive adventure thriller, lies in 24 scrolls said to be the original words of Adam, the first man. Unfortunately, racial and religious conflicts prevent Israelis and Palestinians from even reading the message of love and brotherhood, and one man's greed, hate and lust interfere, another grim parallel with today's events and commentary on humanity.<br /><br />Steve Hart mixes into the bubbling cauldron of the Middle East a down-on-his-luck reporter trying to redeem himself after an irresponsible story, his girlfriend and the heroic Reverend who lusts after her in his heart but stays true to his integrity and his faith, an intrepid archaeologist couple interested in exploring the swinging life, a Perry White-type editor (whose first name is Perry), and a Palestinian terrorist leader handpicked by Yasser Arafat.<br /><br />The archaeologist couple's dalliance with the reporter and his girfriend doesn't add much to the story.  The solution to the simmering conflict might seem as implausible as THE DA VINCI CODE to some readers.  However, the message of the scrolls revealed in a vision, \\"Humanity is one big family,\\" is more important in this book, and so is the intelligent thrill-ride.	2004-10-23

The hero makes pictures with words of exotic locations and doesn't need to be an aloof loner whom the heroine, in a haze of post-coital euphoric insanity (a purely male invention), sets free to wander the world because, after all, he must not be caged. The heroine, dissatisfied with her life of routine that includes a successful career as a literary agent, falls deeply under the spell of seductive e-mails that rewrite her troubled past. But Annie Hollerman knows that words can betray as well as charm, and romantic journalist/divorced father Jack DePaul is part of a world she has succeeded in erasing from her past.<br /><br />The boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-wins-girl-back plot seduces us, much in the way that Jack and Annie's words enchant, for a simple reason: it works. Like Annie, we want to believe in the stories that end, \\"and they lived happily ever after,\\" the resolution of misunderstandings and the power of love and forgiveness. The romantic conventions are pleasantly familiar, but the plot really isn't the star of the story.<br /><br />The main appeal of this sensitive novel, penned by an astute male writer, is, of course, the seductive words, filled with the hearts and souls of perfectly matched lovers Annie and Jack.	2004-10-23

She's also deeply devoted to her Christian faith, and wishes handsome Brian Coulter would pay attention to her.<br /><br />Madeline's crush on Brian leads her into an encounter with a witches' coven led by her friend Lynette's mother, Dian. Madeline agrees to try casting a romantic love spell to win Brian's affections, although the idea of witchcraft makes her uncomfortable even as she begins to raise questions about her faith in her church youth group. But soon Madeline's faith faces an unusual test as a series of tragedies befalls the community of Yokut Springs.<br /><br />When demons appear, Madeline and Brian, who in typical teenage-hero fashion can't communicate the problem to adults, take action to save the community and its members.<br /><br />In true Christian spirit, the most ordinary person (much like the Biblical Jonah) has the most power. Madeline rises to the occasion, confronting the demons' evil.  She makes a terrific role model for today's teens.	2004-10-23

How do you cope when the mothers in your children's elite Washington D.C. playgroup buy facelifts and renovations like you buy burgers at Burger Chalet, or when your friend dates a billionaire who happens to be a major part of your husband's DOJ prosecution of the rogue Microsoft-esque monopoly Megabyte, or when you're more exhausted after raising children than your radical feminist mother was during protest marches? What do you do when the world screams for you to go back to work...and you want to?<br /><br />If you're Amanda Bright, like Dorothy, you discover you need not look any further for happiness than your own back yard.

Mehrunissa, eclipsed by her famous niece/daughter-in-law Arjumand, for whom the Taj Mahal was built, plots court intrigue, demolishes her female rivals, arranges marriages, and still finds time to have a loving relationship with her main man, Emperor Jahangir of the Mughal (not to be confused with Muggle) Empire, which allowed India to dominate the Middle and Far East in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth centuries.<br /><br />Mehrunissa juggles shifting alliances in her family and Jahangir's that make the road map to peace in the Middle East look like a crayon drawing. One interesting aspect is that Mehrunissa doesn't capitalize on the much-vaunted \\"woman power\\" and \\"sisterhood bonding,\\" as her modern sisters do. She views all women, even her own daughter Ladli, as pawns in her plans. (If you think this sounds bizarre, watch The Bachelor reruns.) When Mehrunissa is dying, she regrets not bonding with her soul sisters in Jahangir's harem and consolidating female power.<br /><br />However complex, Mehrunissa is a bold, strong, daring character who holds our attention. Add the sweep and grandeur of this lyrically-written story, and this is a must-read for history buffs and would-be powerful consorts.	2004-10-23

This style may not suit some readers. However, Adam does not deal in quick, easy wrap-ups. Her characters matter, and she wants us to pay attention to their ordinary yet extraordinary paths, hoping for Lenna and Kenny, whose bond is subtly, touchingly portrayed, to become whole, and for the song of LOVE AND COUNTRY, played by Cynthia, to be one of joy and forgiveness.	2004-10-23

Mental disability, a topic no one likes to think about, gets a mature treatment in contemporary literature.  David Conlin McLeod combines this with a riveting, action-packed, well-planned-out vampire blood war, a romance between two sympathetic vampires, and the tender portrayal of a girl's relationship with her vampire grandmother.  The riveting surprise cliffhanger ending makes us, like Amy, eager to continue the dance with the moon.	2004-10-23

Margaret Montreuil's Jesus is interesting enough without shocking revelations.<br /><br />Like Anita Diamant's The Red Tent, this book takes a fresh, original approach, focusing not just on Jesus' ministry and miracles, but on his drama as a human being with his own disappointments and fears, his own joys and sorrows, and his awesome destiny that he surrenders to: to suffer, be crucified,, and be reborn to save mankind from sin.<br /><br />Hollywood secularists, repent: The Jewish religious leaders, channeling Jim Bakker, as well as the Reverend Fred Phelps who erected a monument against murdered Matthew Shepard (who Montreuil's loving, fiery Jesus would not have damned) in Wyoming, condemned Jesus because of their own arrogance. Oh wait, that sounds more like the Hollywood secularists trying to block Mel Gibson's \\"Passion.\\" In the Jewish leaders' denial of Jesus we see grim specters of the ACLU and the liberal left banning Nativity scenes, prayer at public events, and at high school football games. Has Bill O'Reilly read Montreuil's book? Someone send him a copy as a belated Christmas gift. Then, give yourself the experience of knowing the Jesus that Montreuil evokes in her love letter.	2004-10-22

Approximately 4% of adolescents get depressed each year. Up to 2.5 percent of children and 8.3 of adolescents suffer from depression beyond \\"just being a teenager.\\" William Styron exposed the adult condition in Darkness Visible: A Memoir of Madness. Now, A.M. Jenkins has done the same for adolescent depression. If you think teenagers have nothing to be depressed about, you probably repeatedly say, \\"Get over it,\\" to depressed adults. Just pass us the Prozac.<br /><br />Austin Reid, Pride of the Panthers, might seem to have it all, including Heather, his school's most desirable girl...so why is he so numb about everything?<br /><br />A.M. Jenkins beautifully illustrates the contrast between Austin's suicidal feelings and his awkward teenage Pilgrim's Progress, and drives the point subtly home by making the people around Austin, including his best friend Curtis and the perfect Heather as well as the adults, damaged and vulnerable too.

Alys' future is hardly more certain than her past. She must face Evan, the man she abandoned for the United States, and confront at last the complex web of family, duty, love, loyalty, and shame.  It's no easy task, and Alys seems to have lived a life of denial, at least in pop psychology terms. But the grieving that she experiences over the tearing apart of her family eventually surfaces, layer by layer of loamy Welsh soil, until the hard coal of home truths becomes a diamond of redemption. Leiner's prose sparkles with multiple facets, and her characters are no less dimensional.	2004-10-22

Although the story of Leslie Cahill, boarding school escapee, shows some dangers (she is conned by a larcenous drug-using couple) on its heroine's desperate \\"On The Road\\" journey, it skips the elements of prostitution, violence and other dangers runaways commonly fall into.  Still, this is no \\"Pretty Woman\\".  Leslie's frantic journey reveals courage, strength, smarts, and determination.  Author Mary E. Trimble addresses the issue of teen runaways in a gentle way that could only happen in farm country. Unlike the gritty city landscape of child prostitution, hunger, homelessness, abuse and drug use that Covenant House battles, Leslie's flight is an extended road trip of desperation through the backwoods.  It's a story of Leslie's resilient spirit as she proves her courage; the complexity of family love, understanding and forgiveness; and the untamed, raw, rough, vast frontier of adolescence.	2004-10-22

True, there are pages and pages of scientific discussions, as well as hints of building a computer, plus more financial dealings than Donald Trump could keep track of. There's also a tender and globetrotting love story that reminds one of a tragicomic Cold Mountain, as well as more gutsy, educated, daring women than can be found in either Tolkien or Jordan. There's Eliza, the female protagonist who makes Martha Stewart look like a homemaking hobbyist, the Satanist Duchess of Oyonnax, the brilliant precocious Princess Caroline, the pirate queen Kottakka and let's not leave out Jack Shaftoe and his gutsy band of slaves turned entrepreneurs.<br /><br />To try to describe the plot in this review does the book an injustice. The battle scenes supply grit, blood and guts galore, the political and financial intrigues make our dot-com fueled stock market look tame and Bush and Kerry's economic plans straightforward. There are failed and successful invasions, battles over lost love, worries over budgets and currencies, battles on the high seas, and women and men seducing each other for king and country, and sometimes for love. There's even a custody battle. As the French say, plus ça change, plus ça reste la même chose.<br /><br />Although I had not read the first volume, I found The Confusion not confusing, but a delightful linguistic and suspenseful alchemy by a master.	2004-10-22

There's an international (even extraterrestrial!) perspective, intelligent environmental and scientific discourse, as well as the sense that people are finally lighting candles rather than cursing the darkness.<br /><br />Teens are fond of the phrase \\"Get real.\\" In Smith's story, both teens and adults tell the world to get real and listen to WHAT THE ORANGUTAN TOLD ALICE.	2004-10-21

While avoiding a gang known as the Payheads (led by a boy named Duddy, who in name and temperament eerily resembles Harry Potter's cousin Dudley Dursley), gaining other enemies named Big Nino, Johnny Waterman, and Eric Price in the process, and annoying his teacher Ms. Applebee, he tries to be nice to his father's girlfriend Sheila, who emerges as a strong, sympathetic character Bobo comes to respect and relate to. He is haunted by dreams of his artist mother, who died when he was a baby. More importantly, he's trying to reach Bobo World and save it from demons, but he's not sure if his growing yearnings for girls are preventing or helping him.  Although the fantasy is Harry Potter-esque, the book is a contemporary, sharp, well-written, funny, warm portrait of a boy's confusion and rich inner realm that is the true Bobo World. Bobo's magical Oz is filled with love, the complexity of family feelings, and his amazing discovery that contrary to \\"When Harry Met Sally,\\" guys-even \\"Bobolicious\\" ones-and girls really can be friends.	2004-10-21

In America we worry our kids are growing up too fast, with too many weighty issues bombarding them. However, other countries (such as rural India, where teenagers become second wives to 50-year-old brutes) don't share our definition of protecting children.

However, the collection does give us a slower, more innocent style of storytelling that has a definite \\"mouths of babes\\" truth. True to children's lit archetypes, the animals in the stories do talk, but emerge as characters with problems, rather than two-dimensional, cutesy-cuddly, saccharine scenery. The children also are not idealized moppets, but children with their own language, attitudes, thoughts and feelings.  This book is enjoyable family fare.	2004-10-21

This is certainly true of Sharon Kennedy Tosten's love letter to her mentally and physically challenged son Troy, who at 7 years old is much smaller than normal for his age. This book will touch your heart. Through Tosten's fictional character Troy Tomler's eyes, we learn the wonder of Mommy's smell like muffins, Daddy's smell like leather, the joy of DVDs, and the delight of getting gummies. Ordinary stuff, right? Not for Troy, who subtly teaches all of us a lesson in hope and courage.	2004-10-21

Her first book, The Butterfly Touch: Recovery through Poetry, debuted in July 2000 and delighted audiences everywhere.<br /><br />Reed's second book, Seven Bridges: Turning Adversity Into Victory, is somewhat of a departure from The Butterfly Touch. Like The Butterfly Touch, it contains Reed's musings on poetry, but in this outing Reed equally intermingles poetry and prose, from an essay on changing politics and her affection for her blue-collar son-in-law to an intriguing history feature, followed by a poem, about Ruby Bridges, the first black child to be enrolled in an all-white school under court order in 1962. The poem reflects Reed's style at its best: \\"Our six-year-old sacrifice/Carries no cross/No crown of thorns encircles/Her white-ribboned pigtails/No blood stains/Her store-bought dress\\".<br /><br />Reed encourages the reader to be \\"a poet with a voice.\\" The book's gentle writing tutorials continuously invite a dialogue between Reed and her poet readers in-between the seven metaphoric bridges.<br /><br />This reader very much enjoyed the section \\"Bridges to the Past,\\" especially the poem, \\"RFD,\\" told from the point of view of Reed's grandmother Lily Briscoe and portraying the vanished social ritual known as the mail delivery in small-town America. Reed's bridges of poetry and prose, built by her victorious spirit, take us to our own exciting destinations.<br /><br />I have the privilege to know and work and regularly read poetry with this writer.  She is wonderful.	2004-10-13

Don't think that Diana Guerrero advocates a new spiritual fad in advocating that we humans emulate animals.  Aesop knew you can't be a human in dog's clothing.  Guerrero asks us to stop, turn off the computer, TV, cell phone, and most of all our mental noise, and get attuned to the fundamentals through our animal teachers.  She strikes the right balance between addressing humans' shortcomings and addressing the positive and negative qualities of animals.  Authoritative, with intelligent discourse on nature, zoology, animal and human behavior, and religious teachings, this book is a great addition to your library as you search for higher meaning.	2004-01-17

He reveals the canine character as writer, philosopher, educator, architect, gourmet, social reformer, and champion of dogs determined to rewrite ignorant human history, including the story of creation. Move over, Al Gore: Dogs invented the Internet! Any owner who has ever doubted who's in charge will laugh and recognize a beloved pooch.

But Lillian, a huggable Yorkshire terrier, only thinks she's human, and when her human parents, who look in Paul Lopez's vivid drawings like Lucy and Ricky Ricardo (indeed, Lillian does have some of that Lucy knack for getting into scrapes) take her to a party, Lillian discovers the truth about herself. She's a pampered pooch too!<br />  So what does every youngster with a new sibling and an identity crisis do? Lillian runs away from the party. Encounters with the seamier part of the outside world, such as scrounging for table scraps in garbage cans, give Lillian a new leash on life. She spends a night in pet prison (a.k.a. the dog pound) as miserable and unhappy with her fellow prisoners as any human, and gratefully goes home with her mother the next day, to a happy homecoming in which no one judges her and everyone loves her, including that rascally, goofy-faced Peke:<br />  \\"More than anyone else, the Pekinese seems ecstatic to see her.

It's easy to see why; books that challenge an established religion such as the Mormon Church the way This Is The Place does have traditionally not been welcome. Utahians are missing out, because Carolyn Howard-Johnson's lyrical book is a tough-love letter to Utah, and more importantly, a lesson in tolerance. The generations of one large family are bonded by both kinship and conflict. The heroine, half-Mormon, half-Episcopalian Skylar Harriet Eccles, faces the heartbreaking choices of young women in the '50s, conforming to the expectations of family and society or finding her own way. She is ostracized by not being Mormon, and ostracized for being Mormon.<br /><br />I know this author, and her conviction and conscience shine through.

How does she accomplish this?  By showing us the failings in the justice system and the social supports and the schools that could have prevented the deaths of the 70 people of which Glen Rogers has killed, that we know about.  Joyce's most shocking revelation is not that Glen may be the one who actually killed Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson.  This will most likely be a matter of fierce debate, as will her contention that Glen Rogers' depravity is partly due to his unfit parents, who have rendered all but one of their seven children forever damaged (they have 300 arrests between them.)  Her insight into judicial errors of L.A. County and Florida makes you take seriously her argument that the law enforcement officials who failed to stop Glen Rogers before he killed his first victim are as much to blame for the ruined lives as Glen himself.  Joyce sets out to do something revolutionary, and succeeds in sounding a &quot;wake-up call&quot; to all those who just wash their hands of troubled at-risk juveniles.	2001-12-14
