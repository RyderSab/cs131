Original review posted 2005; now we are approaching 2010.<br /><br />----------------------------<br /><br />Ray Kurzweil is a genius, no doubt.  But geniuses are not always right, which should not surprise anyone.  Henry Ford was a world champion at building cars, and a total crackpot about the Jews.  Ray Kurzweil created the software for some of the best keyboards ever made, AND he made big contributions to speech-recognition.<br /><br />But, somehow, in this book, he manages to confuse software with hardware.<br /><br />Everybody involved with computers knows that the hardware is improving at a Very Satisfactory Pace.  Software?  Hmmm...  Software has to be written by human beings....<br /><br />Rather than talk more blather about the Singularity, I will just pose this question --- let's call it a MicroTriumph.  What kind of a machine could perform the MicroTriumph Test?<br /><br />THE TEST:  Place a poodle before the machine, and ask \\"Is this a dog or a cat?\\"  The machine must answer correctly, or fail.  Then ask, \\"What color is this dog?\\"  Again, the machine must answer correctly, or fail.  Repeat the experiment with various animals.  As a finale, put a boy or a girl in front of the machine, and ask it whether this is a boy or a girl.<br /><br />I think most people involved in AI will realize that this is an INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TASK.  It's a very good example at what computers do very poorly --- and what people do \\"without thinking.\\"  In order to pass the \\"MicroTriumph Test,\\" a company will literally have to spend billions and billions of dollars --- not on the CPU, mates, but on the peripherals and the software.<br /><br />Gee, it's 2009 already.  All those who feel that their computers have become noticeably \\"smarter\\" in the last 9 years, raise your hands.  (No!  No Vista victims!)  :-)	2005-07-21

If you actually sit down and read this book, you will find the following FASCINATING information on page 98, \\"President Carter at Home.\\"<br /><br />For context, remember that Carter's overwhelming domestic problem was inflation, which reached 13% during his presidency.  I had read this book (rapidly) a few months ago, but came back for clues about how this particular disaster happened.<br /><br />Well, the answer is obvious.  Carter expanded the money supply.  Not once or twice, but continuously.  He seemed to have some vague idea that printing (or authorizing) more money would just generally be a good idea.  But it's hard to say why Jimmy Carter did anything.<br /><br />When asked about inflation, in April of 1978, Jimmy Carter said, and I quote: \\"It is a myth that the government itself can stop inflation.\\"<br /><br />OK, if you understand Basic Economics, you can pick your jaw up off the floor.  But even more fascinating is what Jimmy went on to say.  He said that inflation forced us to confront unpleasant facts about ourselves, such as the fact that some people were selfish and refused to make sacrifices for the common welfare.<br /><br />So how did Jimmy Carter explain inflation?  It obviously had nothing to do with his own constant expansion of the money supply.  Nope, it was the fault of the idiots who elected him, those selfish American people.<br /><br />This is your clue here: when Jimmy Carter starts explaining things to you, don't bother listening unless you want a totally unfounded guilt-trip.	2005-06-27

In the opposite corner, Fidel Castro.  The opening bell rings!  :-0<br /><br />If I understand the \\"leftist\\" mindset at all well, there is no decision to be made here.  Castro is right, and Geyer is wrong, and that ends that.<br /><br />But -- unfortunately for that mindset -- Georgie Ann Geyer worked really hard in compiling her book, and conducted interviews with hundreds of people, and she knows an awful lot more about Fidel Castro than he knows about her.  She knows that Castro was a killer, even in his university days.  She knows that he was an absolutely ruthless seeker-of-power, like some others we have known (Lenin, Hitler, Mussolini...)<br /><br />And, in his quest for absolute power, Castro was helped by another thing, not much discussed here.  This was the idea that the current system is so corrupt, that anything else would be an improvement.  We citizens of the planet Earth need to be very wary of ideas like this.  For example, in Iran: the idea that the Shah had to go, that anything else would be an improvement. BZZT!  WRONG!  Thirty years of terrorist mullahs certainly put a big damper on that idea!<br /><br />In the same way, the Cubans of long ago partied and had good times and never really dreamed that anyone could be worse than Batista.  Of course, sooner or later, they woke up to the fact that they were being ruled by a thug who would never relinquish power, and who would creep into his senility crowned by Forbes magazine as one of the richest men in the world.  Oh, that hero of the people, that secretive billionaire Fidel Castro!  How could anyone fail to kiss his beard, and declare him the savior of mankind?<br /><br />Geyer does not have the whole story here: she cannot (given the date of publication) quite cover all of the damage done to Cuba.  But in the time of that evil \\"fascist\\" Batista,  Cuba was an economic marvel: its workers were ranked #8 in the world in terms of wages received, among many other things.  Nowadays, Cuba battles it out with Burma for the honors of \\"most godforsaken country.\\"<br /><br />And to think: it is still a \\"fashion item\\" to wear images of Che Guevara, whose main ability was shooting prisoners -- in prison.  Thousands of them!  Fidel's Grand Executioner, and we strut around wearing his image, for what reason?<br /><br />The best biography of this [expletive deleted].

They are both very well-written and well-thought-out books written by people with vast experience.<br /><br />For example, David Smyth was involved in the Linguaphone Thai Course, and then later wrote \\"Teach Yourself Thai.\\"  He is immensely qualified to write the present book, which explains, among other things, why the word \\"talaat\\" (= \\"market\\") has the second syllable pronounced with the LOW tone and not the FALLING tone!<br /><br />But I must have one petty criticism! (Mustn't I?  :-)  )<br /><br />This book does not explain how to look up words in a Thai dictionary, not COMPLETELY.  The question is: which comes first in a Thai dictionary, PIAK ( = wet) or PRIAP (= compare)??  This book gets it all wrong.  The right answer appears in, of all places, \\"Fundamentals of the Thai Language,\\" that totally ancient book which nevertheless sits in the bookshelves of many farang living in Thailand.<br /><br />The answer is right there!

Santayana, typically, enjoys what is there for the taking (the soldier's beauty and young spirit), enjoys his dinner, and then shuffles off, back to his hotel, well content.  The handsome young soldier was happy as well: he had just invited the world's most eminent philosopher to dine, and somehow that invitation worked.<br /><br />---Updated review------<br />Santayana's account of this evening is in his autobiography, \\"Persons & Places,\\" volume II, \\"The Middle Span.\\"  Davenport obviously mined this source to produce his story's framework, but the dialogue is all original with Davenport.<br /><br />However, there is more to the story.  As Santayana tells it, he was on board another ship when he got a message asking for him --- from the head of the table.  And there was the handsome young guard from thirteen years ago.  By now, of course, 25 had turned into 38, and the beauty was pretty much gone.  Rather chillingly, Santayana tells us how he discouraged the renewal of the friendship --- in fact, how he gave the soldier (now married, with a family) the social \\"cut\\" of the scholar.<br /><br />Many people have called George Santayana a cold fish, and right here is one of the reasons why.  I wonder why Davenport's imagination couldn't carry him into this encounter.	2005-01-25

I remember the first time I read this book, and its uncanny presentation of something which has become a central fact of American and European life: the completely strange alliance between the ultra-left faction and the Islamic jihadis.<br /><br />Since then, events have confirmed Horowitz over and over again.  George Galloway is a shining example.  Jimmy Carter is an admirer of Hamas: he wanted to go and shake their hands but they refused (probably having figured out that Carter's credibility is around -700 these days).  And just this weekend, a grand demonstration against Israel, organized by (guess who?) Code Pink, ANSWER, CAIR, and other representatives of people who used to love the USSR, as well as other front groups for the Muslim Brotherhood.<br /><br />Read this book, and shake your head in amazement and pity.  I mean to say, the very least that one might expect is that ultra-leftist feminists would have NOTHING to do with Islamic Fundamentalism, not to mention the routine mutilation of female children.  But everywhere you go, there is nothing but the very loud Sound Of Silence.<br /><br />The critical thing seems to be: \\"Hate America.\\"  If you pass this litmus test, you are welcome at the party.<br /><br />Speaking for myself, I don't find America (or any country) to be perfect, but it seems terribly, terribly obvious that people in America are, shall we say, better off than people living in Zimbabwe, or Syria, or Saudi Arabia, or Iran.  They have more freedom, they have better food to eat, they have MUCH better health-care --- and yet, some people claim to hate the place.<br /><br />You cannot expect people to be rational!<br /><br />A really brilliant job of political analysis.  Don't miss it.	2005-01-19

The debate over the translations here makes a lot of sense in light of Joseph Frank's judgment that Pushkin's poetry is simply untranslatable.  Since I don't read Russian, I can't argue this point, but Frank may well be correct.  I think there is at least one other poet who simply cannot be translated, the Persian Hafez.  That is to say, various translators may indeed produce \\"translations\\" of Pushkin or Hafez, but what gets lost in the process is \\"everything.\\"  Joseph Frank says that so much depends on the choice of exact words in Russian, and the music which arises from mingling their sounds, that you really have to read it in the original.  I think the same goes for Hafez.<br /><br />I have both translations, Nabokov's and Falen's.  Falen's makes better reading, and Nabokov's is more accurate, but they are both failures.  According to Frank, they have to be failures.<br /><br />In contrast, Shakespeare's language gets lost in translation, but there's a lot more to Shakespeare --- the characters, the stories, the psychology --- that does survive translation.<br /><br />If you want something of Pushkin's that DOES translate well, try his short stories, such as the Tales of Belkin.	2005-01-07

This edition was issued by The Heritage Press, and contains a remarkable introduction by Theodore Dreiser. The introduction is something which I have re-read many times. As a beginning, Dreiser recounts his interaction with an intelligent American engineer, aged about 40, who was looking for a book \\"with some meat to it.\\" After long hesitation, and after compiling a list of some dozen books, Dreiser finally decided to recommend \\"The Way of All Flesh.\\"<br />Six months later, he met the engineer by chance while strolling along a street in San Francisco, and the engineer immediately started praising the novel. \\"Now there is a book which is honest! I can't think of another book from its time which contains more honesty, and more direct dealing!\\"<br />And indeed, this may be the main thing working in favor of \\"The Way of All Flesh.\\" Samuel Butler read Darwin, and became a believer in the theory of evolution. He was a penetrating observer of the cruelties of Victorian society, and of its hypocrisies. Few people will read this book without being able to remember this startlingly honest portrayal of a man who has just lost his wife, whom he did not love in the slightest:<br />\\"Theobald buried his face in his hands to conceal his want of emotion.\\"<br />Oh, touche!<br />But other themes are extremely interesting: the idea of taking up a Christian vocation and going into the slums to dedicate your life to serving the poor -- it might work, but it might be a dreadful idea if you don't know what you're doing.<br />And how about the narrator's bald statement:<br />\\"I know of no better thing for a young man than an independent income.\\" (!!) That sentiment is not going to sit well with the people who believe that only a lifetime of wage-slavery is worth living! But Samuel Butler spoke from experience: when he was in his twenties, he escaped to New Zealand and took up sheep-farming, of all things. But... he did WELL as a sheep-farmer, sold out five years later at a very nice profit, and cleared eight thousand pounds. He invested it at ten percent and therefore had an independent income of eight hundred pounds per year. He returned to London, rented an apartment, and devoted the rest of his life to his intellectual life: writing, painting, and music. He is well-known as the author of \\"Erewhon,\\" as well as \\"The Way of All Flesh.\\"<br />You should really take a look at this book. In some ways, it has shaped my life, in ways that sometimes surprise me.

Fisher is quite probably the person who singlehandedly created her field in the English-speaking world: the art of writing about good food, while simultaneously writing about the art of living.<br /><br />This book, \\"The Art of Eating,\\" is actually five of her best books issued within one set of covers.  My copy is getting dog-eared because I have gone back to it so many times.  Fisher writes very well indeed, and her love of life shines through many pages.  This is not \\"just a book about food,\\" any more than \\"Babette's Feast\\" is just \\"a movie about food.\\"  The pages overflow with memorable characters -- unforgettable characters!<br /><br />As for the debate about \\"Eat To Live\\" versus \\"Live To Eat\\" -- which strikes me as an utterly phony debate built on words not life: Fisher simply observes that we all have to eat.  As Brillat-Savarin pointed out, the universe is completely boring without its living creatures, and everything that lives must eat.  You may choose to drop some protein powder in a blender with an egg and some milk, gulp that down and call it breakfast: others would carefully poach that egg and happily eat it with toast and cafe au lait.  Fisher's main argument would be that intelligent people should know how to turn the inevitable time of eating into a time of pleasure, not choking down barbecue with standard-issue American bread and Dr. Pepper.<br /><br />And this point of view, to enjoy the pleasures of the world without simply lapsing into hedonism -- to understand the glorious rapture of peas freshly harvested, and instantly cooked, served with fresh farm butter and salt -- informs all the rest of her life, including her two marriages (to Al and to Chexbres).  The marriage to Chexbres turned out to be the love of her life, and then suddenly everything went terribly wrong -- at the same time the Nazis were taking over Germany, Chexbres came down with a terminal illness.  After living through that hell, Fisher awoke to discover that she was alone.<br /><br />She dealt with it.  She described it, unforgettably.  And in these stories of real life, lived on the edge, the volume sold as \\"The Art of Eating\\" truly becomes something that could be called \\"The Art of Living.\\"<br /><br />This is simply one of the best books I have ever read in my life.it.

I lent two books to a friend, this book and the hard-to-find [[ASIN:142864878X An Account Of The Remarkable Occurrences In The Life And Travels Of Col. James Smith During His Captivity With The Indians In The Years 1755-1759]].  Both books are highly factual AND very incorrect, according to the PC crowd.<br /><br />The book by James Smith is one of the most thrilling tales of the frontier ever written.  It begins when he is riding down a trail with a friend, and shots ring out from an Indian ambush.  His horse rears and throws him in terror, and when he comes to his dead friend is being scalped by the Indians.<br /><br />Scalped.  Do we still remember that word, in modern times, when we fuzzily imagine that the Indians represented Rousseau's \\"noble savage\\" (but with scalping!)?  Have we forgotten that the Iroquois burned their captives alive, or have we fallen comfortably back on the illusion that life with the Indians was all [[ASIN:0446321443 Hanta Yo: An American Saga]] with all of the evil coming from the corrupt, murderous Europeans?<br /><br />This book is a wonderful tonic, and reminder of the way things were, when the \\"genocidal white man\\" was often fighting defense.<br /><br />Anyhow, my friend finished the Smith book and then picked up \\"Out Of America.\\"  About two-thirds of the way through, he called me to comment that the behavior of the Africans in that book made the Indians look like polite Boston matrons at a tea party.  And the atrocious behavior of the Africans can't be blamed on bad leadership or colonial corruption: if you take a look at Stanley's [[ASIN:B000MXAIY8 In Darkest Africa: Or, the Quest, Rescue, and Retreat of Emin Governor of Equatoria, with Two Steel Engravings, 150 Illustrations and Maps]], or perhaps the exciting new biography [[ASIN:0300142234 Stanley: The Impossible Life of Africa's Greatest Explorer]] of the man we call \\"Stanley,\\" it becomes clear as glass that things were even worse in the 19th century.<br /><br />However, this is another example of Thoughtcrime.  I have a friend who has never been to any part of Africa who periodically assures me that things in sub-Saharan Africa are looking up, and the subcontinent is almost entirely democratic \\"by now\\" or will be \\"quite soon.\\"<br /><br />I would suggest reading this book and deciding for yourself.

To begin with, I suspect that the real \\"author\\" of this book was Warren Johanssen, a very important figure -- perhaps the dominant figure -- in the world of New York gay academics.  I say this because (a) Walter Breen was a coin expert and (b) the footnotes and bibliography belong to Warren.<br /><br />Much later, Warren Johannsen made extremely important contributions to \\"The Encyclopedia of Homosexuality,\\" the most important reference work on this topic ever published.<br /><br />But Warren liked to remain in the background.  He had no desire for publicity, but was fluent in some 14 languages.<br /><br />That said, Walter Breen managed to write a fairly stupid book on top of the scholarly background provided by Warren.  His theme throughout the book is that the only purpose of a love between a man and a younger guy is to encourage the younger guy onto the path of True Heterosexuality, and this is a theme so foolish that I am embarrassed to repeat it.  People are who they are!!  Why should a gay man in love with a younger guy act like a parental surrogate, and continue insisting that Lovely Heterosexuality is the goal of life, when in fact his boyfriend might be utterly gay?<br /><br />Walter Breen was a brilliant numismatist, but a very stupid man, who did time in prison several times for extremely inappropriate sexual and social behavior.  Towards the end of his life (I have heard) he began regarding the friends of his sons as legitimate targets (!).  He wound up in prison and died there, as he so richly deserved.<br /><br />Sorry: not all gay men are good!  Welcome to the real world!	2004-03-21

According to my Thai translation of \\"The Little Prince,\\" this book has been translated into 140 languages and has sold 50 million copies.  However, as the little prince himself might be the first to note, that's just the way grown-ups think: they are only interested in numbers.  :-)<br /><br />This is an enchanting story, with a completely improbable cast of characters: a French aviator downed in the Sahara, a little prince who comes from a tiny kingdom on another world, the rose he loves, three tiny volcanoes -- all, hopefully, extinct --- a fox, and a poisonous snake.  Oh, yes, there's a sheep as well, and a glass cover to protect the rose, and a muzzle to keep the sheep from eating the rose.  The last three only exist as drawings which the aviator makes for the little prince.<br /><br />Sometimes I think that any artist who creates a masterpiece tends to tear up the rulebook and start afresh.  Don't misunderstand me: tearing up the rulebook is not enough, in and of itself.  It is also necessary to have something vivid and important to say.  Saint-Exupery wrote his masterpiece in the form of a book for children, but it is surely not a \\"book for children\\" any more than \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is.  It is a charming book, which will very likely move you to laughter and tears --- and perhaps both at the same time.<br /><br />As for choosing an English translation, this strikes me as a molehill which a number have people have been trying to turn into a mountain.

The characters are less than cardboard; Ken Follett (!) tells a better story with better characters.  Comparing it with the work of genuine Russian novelists (Turgenev, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky) is impossible; it's like comparing a broken-down, rusty bicycle with a Boeing 747.<br /><br />Ah, but we hear that \\"this is not important.\\"  (Does that mean that the Philistines have arrived at the party?)  What's important are the ideas, the immensely influential ideas.<br /><br />Well, I will grant that this horrible book was enormously influential, but its influence was deadly poison.  Chernyshevsky preached a gaggle of bad ideas, from atheistic socialism to man's complete lack of free will.  Just that last \\"idea\\" alone destroys any possibility of morality, as Dostoevsky memorably demonstrated in his almost universally misunderstood [[ASIN:1936594676 Notes from the Underground]].  He later became much more explicit in his novel [[ASIN:0375411224 Demons (Everyman's Library, 182)]].<br /><br />Naturally, Dostoevsky would have been horrified by this book's subsequent career: it was Lenin's favorite book, which he re-read many times (cf. Martin Amis' [[ASIN:1400032202 Koba the Dread: Laughter and the Twenty Million]]).  The \\"Utopian Socialism\\" which Dostoevsky went to prison for (as a young man), armed with Left Hegelian atheism, did its very best to destroy Christianity in Russia, and, irony of ironies, to establish Russia as an industrial power.<br /><br />If you want to understand the environment from which such deadly political sloganeering arose, I recommend Joseph Frank's biography of Dostoevsky: [[ASIN:0691013551 Dostoevsky: The Seeds of Revolt, 1821-1849]], of which this is the first volume.  You might want to look into Nabokov's [[ASIN:0679727256 The Gift]], which contains a short biography of this supremely \\"giftless\\" man.	2003-09-24

There are musicians who believe that perfection in performance is Everything.  They will hit every note exactly on time, with exactly the right amount of pianoforte and pedal, and believe that this is the way to a performance masterpiece.<br /><br />The only thing they are missing out on is emotion.<br /><br />In the same way, Nabokov treated the novel as an exercise in performance while writing \\"Pale Fire.\\"  The whole thing is like a gigantic crossword puzzle, waiting for the right genius (or monomaniac) to untangle it.  Is Kinbote the fugitive King of Zembla, or not?  And, to be rude for a moment, who cares?  If Nabokov did not care enough to tell us, but preferred to occupy himself with trivia such as \\"word golf,\\" then one might well guess that this whole entertaining mess was written by Nabokov as a sort of \\"anti-Lolita\\" in his empty afternoons.  (It is beyond any doubt that Kinbote has no use for Lolitas of any kind, but has been a devoted fan of handsome young men since he was born.)<br /><br />But, even there, the novel is curiously devoid of emotion.<br /><br />We have become accustomed to taking Vladimir Nabokov at his own estimation, as some sort of Great Artist.  In fact, there is an argument to be made that Nabokov slaved away as a college professor until he hit on the idea of writing a piece of \\"artistic\\" kiddie-porn (\\"Lolita\\").  He really raked in the bucks from that idea, and immediately left the United States to live out the rest of his life in a high-class Swiss hotel.<br /><br />Born an aristo, and died an aristo.

It is just what the title says, a book doing the job a lawyer does, when he \\"sums up\\" a case before sending it off to the jury for a verdict.  The evidence is examined, witnesses are dissected, and finally the attorney states his view of the case.<br /><br />But Maugham is not summing up a case, he's summing up his life.  As he says, there are a number of issues he has been working on for years, and he wants to set them down while he still has time.  (As it turned out, he had lots of time!)<br /><br />One of the first, and most interesting discussions, is \\"how to write good English prose.\\"  You would imagine that any author worth his salt has opinions on this, but Maugham offers a veritable graduate seminar.  Is an entire lifetime long enough to really master the task?  He examines Swift, Dryden, Dr. Johnson, and a myriad of other classic writers, and finally sums up his own goals in writing English.  In order, they are clarity (lucidity), simplicity, and euphony.  That it to say, Goal One is to express your meaning clearly, and then make sure that it is as simple as possible.  Third, make it sound well on the ear.<br /><br />Another long and interesting discussion concerns drama and the theater.  You'll learn a lot from this \\"master dramatist's\\" long reflection and learning.  In fact, his plays made his fortune --- he earned enough to return to the writing of fiction (he was actually sick of the theater) and began making a whole new reputation as a master of the short story.  Naturally, he provides a long discussion of the various ways to write a story, and finally settles himself firmly in the camp of the ancient storyteller, who held his audience spellbound around a roaring fire.<br /><br />Quite a bit of Maugham's life story does leak into \\"The Summing Up.\\"  Both Maugham and Chekhov are instances of a rather common pattern: doctors who write.  This pattern includes a lot of people, most recently Theodore Dalrymple.<br /><br />To sum up  :-) ---- this is a fascinating book, one of Maugham's best, and very highly recommended.To sum up  :-) ---- this is a fascinating book, one of Maugham's best, and very highly recommended.	2003-06-24

When the first contract for Truman Capote's \\"masterpiece\\" was signed,  Capote received an advance of $25,000 against delivery in January 1968  -- delivery of a book which would rival Proust's masterpiece, \\"Remembrance of Things Past,\\" in portraying the aristocracy of our own times.<br /><br />Well, alarms should have gone off immediately -- they should go off whenever ANY writer says that he's going<br />to \\"do a Proust.\\"  But 1968 came and went, so the publishers gave Capote more money (\\"substantially\\" more)<br />for a three-volume masterpiece, now due in 1973. And so on, and so on, until they finally settled on<br />a $1 million advance in 1980, this time payable only on delivery of the manuscript in 1981.<br /><br />So, who says Truman Capote couldn't spin a captivating tale?  Look at all the greenery he collected for this<br />shaggy-dog story of his \\"final masterpiece!!\\"  :-)<br /><br />Unfortunately, the publishers were not the only parties getting deceived during this fifteen-year escapade.<br />Truman Capote was also deeply involved in deceiving himself.  He may have told himself that he was gathering<br />material for a masterpiece, but he was actually turning himself into the tame lap-dog and court jester of the<br />very rich. Marcel Proust himself would have warned Capote against such a foolish, self-defeating course<br />of action.<br /><br />Capote was of course gay, but his new role as lap-dog to wealthy heterosexuals led him to adopt a strange,<br />tortured role familiar to many closeted socialites. As time passes, you start accepting all the straight<br />conventions, and begin dismissing any gay love affairs as trivial, sordid, or merely amusing, while holding<br />all heterosexual affairs in the highest honor and respect.  In the end, the poor lap-dog may even try<br />to persuade his straight masters that he himself is enthralled with love for a beautiful woman, and start<br />trying to play that tune -- hitting a lot of false notes but keeping his masters entertained.<br /><br />Unfortunately, all this is on view in \\"Answered Prayers,\\" where the author's \\"bisexual\\" alter ego develops a huge, indeed infinitely large, crush on the mysterious beauty Kate McCloud, and maudlinly dedicates his life to<br />rescuing the kidnaped son of his princess, which son is being held in an evil mountain fortress by ogres<br />from the Teutonic lands.<br /><br />Even as Capote descended into writing this sort of childish fairy-tale, his self-loathing grew<br />enormously, from his famous Black And White Ball onwards.  He danced and sang for the entertainment<br />of the jet set, and hated himself for it.  As he began spinning his shaggy-dog story, his real<br />literary output fell to nearly zero, while drugs and alcohol moved to center stage.  In his more lucid<br />moments, however, he took his revenge on his trivial \\"masters\\" by spilling their secrets in a series of<br />devastating short vignettes -- which he brilliantly pretended were chapters from his long-promised,<br />shaggy-dog masterpiece!!<br /><br />It's no such thing, of course: it's an episodic, unstructured, pornographic mess which DID in fact<br />accomplish its unconscious purpose: once Capote began printing excerpts from this \\"novel,\\" his Cafe<br />Society buddies dropped him like the proverbial hot potato.<br /><br />So Capote was free at last -- to be himself and write whatever he liked.  Unfortunately, he had wasted<br />almost two decades and had a couple of giant monkeys on his back.  As things turned out, the next chapter<br />in his life was \\"Dissolution and Death.\\"<br /><br />It is all very sad, but it is also ironic.  If Capote had actually read Proust, this could all have been<br />avoided, for Proust is a sovereign tonic against social climbing -- his devastating analysis of<br />the \\"top layers\\" of Parisian society is enough to put anyone offthe idea that such people are worth<br />pursuing.<br /><br />\\"Answered Prayers\\" has some wonderful smutty stories and a lot of gossip about the sex lives of the rich<br />and famous.

This big Shakespeare book is very welcome and valuable as<br />a general companion to the plays (the sonnets are not discussed<br />much).  It is certainly a book intended for the general<br />reader: it contains nary a footnote and there is no<br />bibliography.  There is not even, alas, an index!<br /><br />However, aside from its use as Shakespeare companion and<br />tutor, this book advances a rather odd thesis that William<br />Shakespeare singlehandedly invented human beings as we know<br />them today.  The average reader will very likely pause,<br />go back to re-read that sentence, and then scratch his head.<br />\\"What?\\"<br /><br />For the sake of perspective, it is a commonplace of social<br />history that the European Renaissance gave birth to our<br />modern conceptions of \\"the individual.\\"  For example,<br />A. L. Rowse's \\"The England of Elizabeth\\" made this point<br />fifty years ago: \\"The increasing national<br />self-consciousness expresses itself; but most significant<br />of all is the growth of words expressing self-awareness<br />and personality, fancy and instinct, acuteness of<br />observation, the psychological consequences of the sense<br />of individuality that is at the core of the Renaissance<br />experience.\\"<br /><br />Well, Bloom is having none of this.  Bloom tells us, rightly,<br />that \\"the age\\" or \\"the times\\" did nothing at all -- wrote<br />no plays, created no art, played no music.  Of course all<br />this was done by people, not by \\"the age.\\"  But Bloom then<br />asserts that the entire Renaissance \\"sense of individuality\\"<br />was the work of William Shakespeare.  This would strike many<br />as a rather odd thought, a side-effect of the Bardolatry<br />which Bloom cheerfully admits.<br /><br />Well, this is a complex issue and we can all decide for<br />ourselves, but here are a few reflections.<br /><br />First, Bloom never even hints that this \\"invention of the<br />human\\" might in fact be a re-invention of the individual<br />found in ancient Greece and Rome.  In this sense, Bloom<br />wants to reconceive the Renaissance as the Naissance --<br />thereby once again showing his enormous blind spot: for<br />such an avid reader, Bloom seems to have read and<br />understood precious little from pagan antiquity.<br /><br />Second, it would seem to stand to reason that -- if Bill<br />Shakespeare was the unique inventor of the human -- that we<br />would find this miraculous event only happening in England;<br />the Renaissance experience in France, Germany, and Italy<br />would be utterly different, and their humanity would remain<br />\\"stuck\\" in the Middle Ages, since Shakespeare didn't get<br />translated very quickly.  But I see no evidence at all of<br />this, and Bloom can't be troubled to supply any.<br /><br />So, my own feeling is that Bloom's grandiose claim should be<br />whittled back to Shakespeare's visible achievement, in<br />revolutionizing the representation of human beings in his<br />plays, of building on the masterpieces of antiquity<br />(Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides) and surpassing them in<br />certain key aspects.  With this in mind, it is easy to<br />enjoy the rest of the book.blind spot: for  such an avid reader, Bloom seems to have read and  understood precious little from pagan antiquity.

And -- if you pause to consider the quality of the English (unclear thoughts, mundane vocabulary, eccentric punctuation) -- it is trebly evident that Thomas Thorp wrote the page just cited, and that \\"Mr. W.H.\\" is Thorp's man, not Shakespeare's.<br /><br />Everything else comes in an easy tumble once you get this simple fact right: Mr. W.H. is Thorp's man.  He's the man who found the manuscript of the sonnets and handed them to the overjoyed publisher.  And he is surely Sir William Harvey, Southampton's step-father, who had just inherited the contents of the Southampton<br />house from his deceased, much older, wife, the young Earl's mother.<br /><br />Aha!  So: Southampton was Shakespeare's brilliant, wealthy, powerful and handsome patron.  The young Southampton refused to marry, even though he needed to produce an heir; he preferred having a good time.<br />Now we understand the opening theme of the sonnets, and we can see the obvious patron-client relationship between the very attractive young lord and the brilliant poet.<br /><br />There are many more fascinating revelations in this book, as is only natural -- Rowse cracked a puzzle which had frustrated everyone for four hundred years.  And his reward?<br /><br />Buried in oblivion!  Ostracism!  Ignored, despised, shut out!  And this is where the book really shines.

Aside from language evolution, Bickerton makes one point that philosophers should be paying attention to.  The question is how we get from sense perceptions to words, and Bertrand Russell for one got this wrong.  He imagined that words map directly to sense perceptions, and got into huge philosophical trouble.  The truth is apparently a bit more complex.  We humans (and other beasts) have what might be called a \\"sensory subsystem,\\" which senses the outside world and hands us a \\"concept.\\"  In the case of a frog, for example, the concept of \\"bug\\" produces appropriate catch-the-bug behavior.  In the case of humans, the concept \\"bug\\" gets mapped onto the word for \\"bug\\" (which would be \\"malang\\" in Thai, \\"insecte\\" in French, etc.)  So, in Bickerton's view, our words map to \\"concepts,\\" which in turn map to sense perceptions.<br /><br />This may seem to be similar to quarreling over angels dancing on the head of a pin, but in fact it is a huge difference, and would be directly relevant to anyone who wanted (say) to make computers speak English.	2002-10-13

For one thing, as Balzac's intrepid biographer notes, it is a bit odd that \\"Pere Goriot\\" has become the school-assigned-text of choice.  Not only do crime, corruption, and vanity reach levels which shock the average reader, Balzac also slips in the first case of a huge attraction of an older man for a younger man.<br /><br />The difficulties begin when you begin reading the book: Balzac devotes pages and pages to describing the \\"Maison Vauquer,\\" and manages to convince the reader that this squalid boarding house is not only boring and squalid, but perhaps incomprehensible to people who live outside of Paris.  If you make it through this opening section, you will have begun to accustom yourself to Balzac -- who is at one time the worst of writers, and the best --- and who also feels completely free to assault you with his home-baked philosophy of life at every turn.<br /><br />\\"Pere Goriot\\" has often been compared to \\"King Lear,\\" but as soon as the comparison is made, we need to begin counting the enormous differences between the two works.  Lear loved his daughters, but he can't hold a candle to Goriot in this respect.  Lear was disillusioned rather quickly, while Goriot died with his fantasies intact.<br /><br />However, this lurks in the future.  The first thread of the story is the tale of the young provincial Rastignac, who has come to make his mark on Paris.  He is ambitious, but we need to understand what this term means for Balzac.  Ambitious?  Does this refer to a young student of medicine, who wants to advance the science of medicine, or to a young writer, who wants to write the most dazzling works he can?<br /><br />Well, no.  For Balzac (and all the characters of his \\"Human Comedy\\") \\"ambition\\" means nothing more than social climbing.  \\"Success\\" means being received in the highest circles of Parisian society, most likely the Faubourg Saint-Germain.  Readers who thought of \\"ambition\\" in other terms will need to re-calibrate here.<br /><br />Before long, our young hero Rastignac is getting a full-blown lecture on the delights of a life of crime, from the mysterious and sinister M. Vautrin.  He proposes a monstrous scheme to our young hero for marrying into a dowry of a million francs --- a scheme which will involve \\"only one murder.\\"<br /><br />Well, I can't reveal any more of the story without ruining it.  But it may help to understand that Balzac himself was fixated on the subject of money: he was the first writer to make sure that we all understood the relative financial standing of all his characters.  He was also fixated on the social hierarchy of Paris.<br /><br />This novel is widely regarded as one of the best novels ever written.  I think I agree.  At times, it will exalt you; sometimes it may bring a tear to the eye; the finale may horrify you.  But at least you will make the acquaintance of Balzac.  If you would like a bit more, I would suggest \\"Cousin Pons.\\"ht of \\"ambition\\" in other terms will need to re-calibrate here.<br /><br />Before long, our young hero Rastignac is getting a full-blown lecture on the delights of a life of crime, from the mysterious and sinister M.

His central message is a very important one -- Western civilization is apparently at some risk of abandoning its literature.<br /><br />However improbable this may sound, I hasten to assure you that our radicalized universities have done everything in their power to neglect and abandon our literary masterpieces. At a large state university in California, the standard reading list for the \\"Great Books\\" course (formerly several dozen books) has been reduced to:<br />1. Plato's \\"Symposium\\"<br />2. Thoreau's \\"Walden\\"<br />3. Gandhi's \\"Hind Swaraj\\"<br />4. Alice Walker's \\"The Color Purple\\"<br /><br />Even more melancholy is the fact that this list evidently includes one \\"gay\\" book, one \\"environmentalist\\" book, one \\"pacifist\\" book, and one \\"feminist\\" book. That three of them are bilge seems not to have occurred to the nominating committee. (Many would deny Thoreau that palm -- I urge them to re-read this idiotic pretentious crack-pate in the company of \\"Saint Gandhi\\" and his lunatic prescriptions for India: \\"Get rid of all the trains and all the doctors,\\" indeed!)<br /><br />So, the current situation in American universities is chilling, reminiscent of the Chinese purges during the \\"Cultural Revolution\\" (which was actually neither cultural nor a revolution, come to think of it, since it was a counter-revolution instigated by Mao against his enemies, and was explicitly anti-intellectual and anti-cultural. A mob attacked and destroyed the birthplace of Confucious during those palmy days.)<br /><br />Nevertheless, although Bloom is fighting the good fight, and is extremely erudite and thought-provoking, I must note two very serious objections to this present work.<br /><br />First, the Greeks and the Romans are mostly absent. I really don't see how you can even pretend to discuss \\"The Western Canon\\" and leave out Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles and the rest of the Greeks and the Romans. Especially since Bloom is extremely fond of the Old Testament (\\"the Yahwist\\"), this omission is startling.<br /><br />Second, I strongly object to the presence of Freud in this book. This mountebank first demanded our attention as a scientist -- as a man of medicine. To find him transmogrified into a Literary Artist -- at Bloom's whim -- simply boggles the imagination.<br /><br />If you put these two faults together, and conclude that Freud has been included at the expense of the Greeks, then the result is a tremendously flawed book.

Born in a Shi'ite area of Iraq, he returned to his native Persia after completing a traditional religious education. He had an active political career (serving in the Mossadeq cabinet, for example) and also published many scholarly works on Persian poetry.<br /><br />This book is his attempt to deal with the phenomenon of Muhammad, and the Islamic religion he created. Most Westerners are not really aware that Persians are NOT Arabs. Persians speak an Indo-European language (Farsi) while Arabs speak a Semitic language (closely related to Hebrew). As a result, many educated Persians/Iranians view the Arabs as barbarian invaders, comparable perhaps to the Mongols, while it is widely known that Persia is one of the most ancient civilizations on the planet.<br /><br />On the whole, I think Dashti deals with Muhammad fairly. Of course, this was an extremely dangerous book to write, and he didn't really get away with it, in the end. The 83-year-old Ali Dashti was dragged to Khomeini's dungeons and beaten or tortured, giving up the ghost two years later. It is a remarkable thing: beating an 83-year-old man because you disagree with his thinking.<br /><br />My own historical researches make me ask: is there any more reason to believe in Muhammad than in Joseph Smith? (Joseph Smith is the \\"prophet\\" who founded the Mormon religion.) Or were these two men basically living the same old story, separated by 1300 years of history?<br /><br />Highest recommendation!!	2001-12-17

That question is: &quot;Did Joseph Smith REALLY receive a divine revelation which he set down in the Book of Mormon?&quot;  If your answer to that question is &quot;Yes,&quot; then you get to explain how the Native Americans were the Lost Tribes of Israel!  This is, of course, impossible to do, since the Native Americans are now known to be of Asian origin -- through studies of linguistics and DNA.  And that's one of the big problems with the &quot;Book of Mormon&quot; -- its claims are so specific that they are actually falsifiable (unlike e.g. the generalities and moralizing found in the Koran).<br />That question set aside (hopefully), this biography documents with meticulous detail Smith's exact sources for his holy forgery, including Ethan Smith's &quot;View of the Hebrews&quot; and the contemporary political uproars over Freemasonry.<br />This view of the Native Americans may have seemed plausible in the 1820's, but why would anyone follow Joseph Smith, whose previous line of work was divining and gold-digging?  The only answer seems to be: this is embedded in human nature.  There are a lot of people out there who have a need to believe, and they flit from one cult to another, never for a moment imagining that they could have an independent life outside of a cult.<br />The story of Joseph Smith is also the story of Muhammad.  In just the same way, an uneducated man &quot;received&quot; a divine book and created a whole new religion.  And the adherents of that religion argue that it must be true because &quot;so many&quot; people believe in it.  Well, there are 3 million Mormons.  :-)<br />This is also the story of what I have seen in my own lifetime: the Hare Krishnas (still going in Australia, by the way), the Moonies, the Rajneeshies, the Branch Davidians, and -- most recently -- the Islamic suicide cults led by the likes of Osama Bin Laden.  (Not to mention Jonestown, or those weirdos in Rancho Santa Fe who committed mass suicide over the arrival of a comet.)  In every case, we find a leader who fits the &quot;imposter&quot; psychological pattern, and who has the charisma to attract followers, associated with a group of &quot;believers&quot; who apparently have no standard of truth whatever, but rush around looking for imposters to follow.

I have been living in Thailand for eight years now, and will never be parted from this book.<br /><br />When I was in the US, I was frequently frustrated by the inability to easily buy all of the necessary ingredients (fish sauce, fermented bean sauce, phrik kii nuu, and all the rest).  But when I began living in Chiang Mai, I was able to discover that the recipes are all delicious!<br /><br />Some recipes are vastly complicated, especially the ones which recommend pounding up your own curry pastes.  I did this exactly one time, and the results were A++.  But these days I can get an A by going down to the local market and handing the curry-paste vendor 25 cents for a small plastic bag full of the stuff SHE makes (and it's very good).<br /><br />If you can do this, then a seemingly complex recipe like \\"panaeng muu\\" becomes the simplest thing in the world -- and, trust me, this pork curry will disappear.  \\"Constantly good, constantly gone\\" seems to apply here!  :-)<br /><br />Of course, I would add some items to this book for people who are living in Thailand.  Probably the first would be \\"Roast Loin of Pork.\\"  Alas, it is very hard to get pork in the US, unless you count bacon and pork chops, and forget the rest of the animal.<br /><br />But --- if you are interested in Thai cooking --- the place to begin is here.

James Carroll makes extensive use of primary sources in drawing up this troubling history of Christian anti-Semitism.  The most obvious primary source, consulted over and over again, is the New Testament.<br />He reports conflicting attitudes within the Church. (If there had been no conflicts over anti-Semitism, that would have been pretty disturbing!)<br />Are we denying the blood-libel? That up into the twentieth century, prominent Christians and Vatican spokesman routinely accused the Jews of drinking the blood of Christian children as part of the rites of Passover?<br />Are we denying the pitiful historical tale of Pope Innocent IV desperately trying to stop his own archbishop during the slaughter of the Jews of Vienne?  Are we denying that there was such a slaughter, and that persecution of the Jews as &quot;Christ-killers&quot; was just part of &quot;Business As Usual?<br />Negative reviewers of this book seem to concentrate on attacking James Carroll's person (the &quot;ad hominem&quot; argument), or else attacking his methods.  For some reason, they seem unable to attack his main thesis, which is that Christians have been persecuting Jews for 2,000 years.  And not just Jews.  Christians have also been persecuting gay males for 2,000 years...but Carroll doesn't want to get into that can of worms.<br />Perhaps the quickest summary of this book's message is simply to state that God belongs to all mankind, and that the Christian religion committed an awful mistake when it arrogated God to itself and declared that no other religion could have Him.<br />All the negative reviews fade into insignificance when we open Malcom Hay's book, &quot;Europe and the Jews,&quot; and read just five pages from Chapter Five (or any other chapter).<br />Time to learn your history, folks.	2001-06-27

Oh, \\"it measures the percentage of BS in things.\\"  Hmm, could be a useful tool<br />-- but it doesn't exist.<br /><br />If there were such a thing, it would register very nearly 100 percent when presented with this absurd book.<br /><br />Why do I call it absurd? Well, take a look at this statement, which Father Teilhard considered so important that it deserved a whole paragraph to itself:<br /><br />\\"In the last analysis the best guarantee that a thing should happen is that it appears to us as vitally necessary.\\"<br /><br />So -- using our powers of analytical thinking -- we can reduce this sentence to the proposition that we will get whatever we really need.  Which is nonsense, as every failed lottery contestant and starving infant can assure you.<br /><br />As those eminent philosophers The Rolling Stones once said, \\"You can't always get what you want, but if you try real hard, you just might find that you get what you need.\\"  The Stones seem to disagree with Father Teilhard -- the Stones seem to think that some human effort is necessary in order to get what you need.<br /><br />None of this is scientific thinking, of course.  So how did this book ever get a reputation as a scientific book?<br /><br />Well, part of it is \\"jumping on the bandwagon.\\"  As Brian Silver brilliantly shows in \\"The Ascent of Science,\\" every major scientific discovery has been pounced on by the ignorant and mistakenly applied to everything under the sun.  Newton's Laws of Motion were applied to politics, medicine, and human behavior.  David Hume thought he saw \\"inertia\\" in thought! (\\"Every thought will continue thinking in the same direction at a constant speed unless acted on by some force?\\")<br />Similarly, the law of universal gravitation was dragged into politics, biology, and chemistry.  And the same fate lurked for Einstein and Darwin, naturally.<br /><br />Charles, meet Father Teilhard! The fundamental process or motion in the universe is evolution, and evolution is \\"a general condition to which all theories, all hypotheses, all systems must bow...\\" Now, there is the biggest bandwagon-jump I have ever seen!<br /><br />All theories must bow to the general law of evolution? Really? How about Newton's Laws of Motion?  They haven't evolved a bit during the history of the universe.  How about rocks?

As Brian Silver remarked, \\"Here we are in the land of unprovable statements, abuse of language, and everything that has given mysticism a bad name.\\"  Just like a TV psychic babbling of \\"focusing cosmic energy,\\" Father Teilhard takes strictly defined terms such as \\"energy,\\" uses them in the loosest metaphorical way, and then pretends that his \\"energy\\" corresponds to the \\"energy\\" found in a scientific text.<br /><br />As Peter Medawar brilliantly remarked, this sort of book finds a huge audience among people who have been educated far beyond their capacity to undertake analytical thought.he same fate lurked for Einstein and Darwin, naturally.

When you are struggling with Abhidhamma or other questions, go to this book first for a RELIABLE overview and summary.<br /><br />Yes, I am utterly familiar with \\"What the Buddha Taught,\\" an excellent book.  But it says little or nothing about the two main streams of Buddhism, Theravada & Mahayana --- and yes, I am aware that some people hate these terms.

A lot of Americans, including myself, used to say that Buddhism was really more of a philosophy than a religion, since it was not a God-religion like Christianity.<br /><br />Well, welcome to Thailand.  Sure, you're right, Buddhism is not a God-religion; it's a religion with a thousand gods, demigods, and Arahants.  Rather than being a \\"pure philosophy\\" which preaches the doctrine of reincarnation, Thai Buddhism embraces both the idea of going to heaven AND the idea of being reborn.  For example, if you have been a really good person, you may go to Heaven for a thousand years, and then be reborn as a great spiritual leader.  If you messed up, you may go to Hell for a while, and be reborn as a snake.  The central Buddhist ritual in Thailand is \\"tham boon\\" == \\"making merit.\\"  This is done in the frank hope of having a better life to come.  Rupert Gethin mentions such things, and so the consumers of \\"Export Buddhism\\" are naturally shocked!<br /><br />By the way, my current interest is in dhyana / jyana states in meditation.  Apparently, these are states of mind available to anyone willing to put in the time and work.

By just this one criterion, \\"The Cantos\\" are a spectacular failure.<br /><br />I also have an \\"old-fashioned\\" respect for the truth, and just glancing through one of the companions to \\"The Cantos\\" will show you that Pound made countless mistakes: his reach exceeded his grasp.

But they remain failures, even such wonderful poems as \\"Exile's Letter.\\"<br /><br />In the end, unless you have the patience to go hunting for little gems, \\"The Cantos\\" finally boil down to gibberish, corrupted by Pound's lunatic home-brewed economics and his attraction to Mussolini's Fascism.  I don't think he was actually insane: his stay in St. Elizabeth's mental hospital was urgently arranged by his literary friends, who did not want to see him jailed or hung for treason.  But it remains true that he shut his mouth in his old age, basically admitting that he had been telling people what to do for decades, and that his advice was not always good.<br /><br />If you want to see the better side of Pound, the Library of America has a volume of (basically) everything except \\"The Cantos:\\" [[ASIN:1931082413 Ezra Pound: Poems and Translations (Library of America)]].

In particular, the Thai alphabet is taught according to the Linguaphone scheme, which is a very clever one.  A previous reviewer didn't see the rationale, so I'll explain.  The letters are introduced according to their consonant class.  In Lesson One, we get an important subset of the low-class consonants, and then a chunk of mid-class consonants, and so on.  The result is that the student automatically clumps them together as &quot;the letters from Lesson One&quot; and thus comes to identify consonant classes semi-automatically.  As a bonus, the Lesson One consonants are the SPECIAL low-class consonants which are overridden in multi-syllable words.<br />Now, this leaves you without the knowledge of the dictionary order, so you'll have to learn that as a separate task.  But I think that the consonant classes turn out to be much more important than that dictionary order, because unless you're absolutely sure of the consonant class, you can't determine the tone(s) and therefore can't really pronounce what you're reading.<br />I would also encourage all students of Thai to view the transliteration scheme (ANY transliteration scheme) as a mere bridge to get you to the Thai script.  Burn the bridge as soon as you can (it may not be very soon!)<br />If you find this book to be tantalizing but a little too short, I warmly encourage you to get yourself the Linguaphone Thai Course, which expands on this short book quite a bit.	2000-12-04

Malcolm Hay, a profoundly good man, wrote this book to document, once and for all, the history of Christian anti-Semitism (or: \\"Jew-hatred\\").<br /><br />The whole history is here, folks.  We have to start with the difficult facts that (1) all early Christians, including Jesus and St. Paul, were Jews, and (2) the entire \\"Christian Bible\\" had been written by Jews.  Given these primary facts, it would seem insane, or preposterous, to allege that these very same Christians, and their children) would become the biggest Jew-haters in the world. [I am editing this review, because we now have a new champion, it appears.  Muslim hatred of the Jews is so omnipresent and so ill-concealed that it is now holding First Place in Global Jew-Hating.  That, of course, means Last Place Among So-Called \\"Civilized\\" Nations.]<br /><br />But it did indeed happen.  At the beginning, everyone was Jewish -- Jew and Christian alike.  But the differences in faith obviously created a schism.  And so the \\"Christian Jews\\" were faced with the eternal problem of defining their own, separate, identity -- and various articles of the Jewish faith got tossed overboard.  Just as one example, circumcision: mandatory for Jews, it was first discarded by St. Paul during his successful attempt to convert the Roman and Greek pagans (who, for obvious reasons, had no desire to endure this useless and painful surgery as adult males).  That was just the beginning.  In the end, circumcision became a way to identify persons of differing religions -- Christians were not circumcised, while Jews and Muslims were.<br /><br />Are human beings petty, or not?  Malcolm Hay asks many of these questions as he moves beyond the early schism, and begins discussing such major Jew-haters as St. John Chrysostom.  This marvellous \\"saint\\" preached and wrote a whole series of \\"Homilies Against the Jews.\\"  I could quote them here, but it would be too offensive for community standards.  But I will note one curious fact, that hardly anyone else seems to have noticed: the Roman Catholic Church has finally disowned those \\"Homilies Against the Jews.\\"  If you go to a good religious library, you can often find the old edition of Chrysostom, which contains all those nasty volumes.  The newer edition simply cuts the homilies against the Jews, without a word.<br /><br />As we move forward into history, into the Middle Ages, we begin to see people (i.e. Jews) being burned alive.<br /><br />But I'm not going to tell you the entire story.

I won't really comment on the novel itself, except to remember for a moment the intense hostility of academic English departments to this \\"trashy novel for children,\\" \\"this [...] of good and evil.\\"  By now, the academy has come around, and they realize (as I did way before them) that \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is going to stay in print for a much longer time than Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\" or Pound's \\"Cantos.\\"  Whether they like it or not.  :-)  And, of course, like it they should!<br /><br />I really want to review this edition of Tolkien's book, which serves him very well indeed.  Finally bound in genuine leather, this book is a treat to hold and to own.  And it's something to hand down to your children, which I'm afraid you can't do with digital books.  As a former software engineer, let me just comment that paper is BY FAR the longest-lasting archival material, and that I have yet to see any digital format that does not eventually die out.  If you put this book, this PAPER book, in your library, and don't mistreat it, it should last for centuries.<br /><br />Which is where I think book publishing is going: digital media for ephemera, with paper publishers forced into glorious editions of the classics.<br /><br />But, as Crick memorably commented, \\"How It Will All Turn Out Remains to be Seen.\\"  HIWATORTBS!!  :-)<br /><br />In the meantime, enjoy this book.	2000-11-06

I have just been reading through reviews (positive & negative) of Oliver Stone's attempt to \\"do\\" Alexander the Great.  And it struck me that those people were simply wasting their time.<br /><br />If you want to know about Alexander the Great, read Mary Renault.  If you want to understand Ancient Greece, read Mary Renault.<br /><br />Oliver Stone does not even come close.<br /><br />\\"The Persian Boy\\" is one of the best romantic novels ever written.  It is thrilling and exciting stuff from beginning to end.  And it is, fundamentally, as true a story we can expect about a man who has been dead for almost three thousand years.  This wonderful novel will expand your mind; watching the Oliver Stone movie will make it shrink.  It's just that simple.	2000-11-04

If you are at all like me, you have Sincere Doubts that a tale of mathematics could do anything but put you right to sleep.  Well, so much for our preconceptions!!  (I know about mine, but am guessing about yours, naturally.)<br /><br />This is an absolutely wonderful book, and you don't need to be a math wizard to enjoy it.  Simon Singh does a wonderful job at making you feel that you \\"sort of\\" understand the math involved.  (Does he cheat?  How could I know??  It's like asking me to judge a translation from an Eskimo tongue!)<br /><br />Don't let that fact deter you.  You will probably be drawn into this book, willy-nilly, simply by the words which set the scene.  One of the world's great mathematicians, Fermat, idly noted in the margin of a book he was reading, that the Pythagorean Theorem (which my father used to recite as \\"the squaw on the hippopotamus is equal to the sum of the squaws on the other two hides\\") --- ahem, more formally, Hypotenuse (squared) = (Side1(squared) + Side2(squared)).  So what?  We all learned this in school.<br /><br />Well, Math Genius M. Fermat scribbled in the margin of his book \\"This equation only works for the power of two.  It does not work for any other number as exponent.  I have found a wonderful proof of this theorem, which alas the margin of this book is too small to hold.\\"  Then Math Genius Fermat put the book back on his bookshelves, and, sooner or later, gave up the ghost --- without making his claim public.  Curious people going through his library, later on, found this outlandish claim and published it.  And, slowly but surely, the mathematical world came to realize that Fermat was most probably right --- the equation only worked for the power of two --- but they had no idea at all of how to prove it.<br /><br />Thus was the gauntlet thrown down, to all future ages of mathematicians.  And thus was born a really fascinating tale!!  All around the world, math experts would chat about \\"Fermat's Last Theorem,\\" and wonder whether or not it was nonsense, all the while realizing that IF ONLY THEY COULD PROVE IT, they would win lasting fame and, perhaps, mathematical immortality.<br /><br />They all failed.  The decades and the centuries rolled by.  Amateurs of math began competing for prizes set up by distinguished committees.  The mathematical world grew more and more frustrated.<br /><br />In the twentieth century, at last, the problem began to be solved (perhaps!), and the initial crack at the solution came from a totally unexpected place: a couple of Japanese geniuses who had no clue that they were part of the solution to the grand puzzle --- one of them was particularly brilliant and tragic, taking his own life at a young age.<br /><br />I cannot and will not spoil this story any more.  But I hope that I have whetted your appetite to find out what really happened.  Was the puzzle solved?<br /><br />Read the book and find out!!!  :-)the while realizing that IF ONLY THEY COULD PROVE IT, they would win lasting fame and, perhaps, mathematical immortality.

US	52567412	RYC1NRTMLTQ4W	0375726810	446299605	The Last of the Wine	Books	5	4	4	N	Y	A very fine imaginative re-creation	\\"The Last of the Wine\\" had a deep influence on my life.  Recommended to me by a fine Spaniard in Amsterdam as \\"the best gay novel ever written,\\" I naturally bought it at the first chance.  I think it changed my life, a little bit.  It brought home to me two facts I have been dealing with ever since.<br /><br />The first fact is that men can and do love one another.  The problem with the word \\"homosexual\\" is that it manages to suggest that it's all about sex.  For me, it's all about love.  But many gay men have been damaged by their upbringing, and continue to insist that it's all about sex, because that's as far as they will go.<br /><br />\\"The Last of the Wine\\" has its priorities right, in my view.  There is no question that Alexias and Lysis have sex (off-camera), but the love between them is much more important.<br /><br />The second fact is that men can and do love both sexes.  In modern America, the very idea is brushed off as \\"nonsense,\\" and there is almost no dissent on this subject.<br /><br />Things were quite different in Ancient Greece, as this meticulously-researched and supremely well-written novel points out.  And, if we are so different from the men in Ancient Greece, well: would that be a matter of cultural programming, or a matter of biology?<br /><br />Read \\"The Last of the Wine\\" and wonder about these questions!  :-)  Or not.  The most important thing is to read it.  It really is a masterpiece!	2000-09-12

But I had a lot of trouble with other &quot;fairy-tale&quot; aspects of the faith as well.  How does a benevolent  God create hell? If God exists, why doesn't he speak?<br />This is the ONLY  book I have ever read by a Christian where I found myself saying YES, YES,  YES on every page.  Spong addresses all the problems (from Copernicus to  Darwin) and addresses them intelligently.<br />A book that is destined to be a  classic. If Christianity has a future, it will resemble  this.  The  fairy-tale stuff is doomed.	1999-05-17

He was in fact a very attractive Indian boy of 14 when the eyes of the \\"Reverend\\" Leadbeater fell on him -- Leadbeater being a great fan of young boys.  So he was \\"adopted\\" and taken into \\"the faith\\" (with his brother, I think), and the good Reverend oversaw K.'s education up to the age of 20.  Then, for some reason, the Rev split to Australia and K. broke with the Theosophical movement.  \\"For some reason.\\"  Call for Sherlock Holmes!!  What happened?<br /><br />I bet it had nothing to do with Hidden Masters or Koot Hoomi.  :-)<br /><br />Highly recommended reading for evenings when you require a strong dose of The Higher Human Stupidity.	1998-12-14
US	52567412	R1CE5SKCG8C1V5	1434411389	485598951	Cousin Pons	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A Parisian tragedy...	This is absolutely one of my favorite novels by Balzac; his character invention soars to new heights with his creation of Sylvain Pons and his best friend, a German named Schmucke.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />Pons is the protagonist; a musician who almost made it to the big time, but didn't pay enough attention to his orchestration.  Now he gives private lessons and conducts a theatrical orchestra, and barely gets by.<br /><br />Pons is dominated by two very different manias.  The first is collecting small works of \\"bric-a-brac,\\" which includes such masterpieces as a fan created by Watteau for Mme Pompadour, which Pons manages to acquire for ten francs (it is worth thousands).  His private museum contains 2,000 wonderful works of art, probably worth a million francs all told --- although he would never dream of selling them.  His second mania, alas, is gourmet dining.  He has learned, and learned well, what truly fine food and wine taste like, and he's addicted.  He became addicted when he was a popular young musician during the Empire, but now he has fallen to the status of a mere parasite, a \\"hanger-on,\\" a poor relation.  At the time the story opens, he is barely tolerated --- almost openly mocked --- at the homes where he appears \\"just at suppertime.\\"<br /><br />Like many Balzac novels, this one does not keep you in the dark about exactly how much money each character has, in property and income, and the eternal Parisian struggle for more money and higher status.  Suffice it to say that Pons' richie relatives look upon him as a fool until a crisis puts him at death's door, and the richies learn about his magnificent art collection.  Understanding nothing of art whatsoever, these ignorant clods understand a million francs perfectly, and so the last days of Sylvain Pons must be devoted to defending his property against those richie relatives, who reveal themselves as unscrupulous thieves.<br /><br />It's not cheerful reading, but tragedies rarely are. \\"Cousin Pons\\" will leave you shivering with horror, and asking yourself, \\"Is this really what mankind amounts to?\\"<br /><br />If you enjoy this, there is a lot more excellent stuff where this came from!horror, and asking yourself, \\"Is this really what mankind amounts to?\\"    If you enjoy this, there is a lot more excellent stuff where this came from!	1998-11-25

(This is a review of [[ASIN:0679600051 In Search of Lost Time, Volume 1: Swann's Way]], the Modern Library hardback edition.)<br /><br />I notice the reviewer who claims that this is great reading for middle-aged people.  Well, I have a friend whose mother says that you must wait until you are 70 before reading this novel.<br /><br />All I can say is that I read it in college and learned one extremely important lesson from it: \\"social climbing is a complete waste of time.\\"  This was an important thing to learn while I was still young, and I'm glad I didn't wait until the age of 40 or 70 to appreciate it.<br /><br />And the lesson comes from someone who spent a few years in social climbing.  He may have concluded that it was all a waste of time (\\"lost time\\" in a different sense), but what a story he made of it!<br /><br />I don't quite understand all the people who are \\"afraid\\" of this enormous novel.  I suggest: pick up the first volume and give it a read.  Nobody is holding a gun to your head.  If you don't like it, that's fine.  But you should be aware that, in the first two volumes, Proust is really just warming up his orchestra and playing a grand overture. (\\"How the $%^&# could some nutter Frenchman spend more than 1,000 pages on a freeping OVERTURE?\\"  Well, part of the answer is that it is an extremely well-written and thought-provoking overture.  But, if you get to Volume III, be prepared for the greatest social comedy ever written. Madame Verdurin and the Baron de Charlus step forward in full character, as well as Francoise, all of them giants of world literature.)<br /><br />Even in this first volume of the \\"overture,\\" there is a complete novella called \\"Swann in Love.\\"  It will make you familiar with the main Proustian obsession, which is jealousy, and prepare you for the later \\"Variations on a Theme\\" which follow.<br /><br />By the way, the first 30 pages or so are about trying to go to sleep, and waiting for his Mama's good-night kiss...	1998-11-24
