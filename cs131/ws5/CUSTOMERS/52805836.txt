The case studies are almost like detective stories. The reader wants to know how they end and what the authors learned. Too many technical books these days are both too dense and too full of errors. Perhaps those are related. The books are so dense that neither the author nor the editors find the mistakes. This book was easy to read cover-to-cover because it's concise, clear, accurate, entertaining, and informative. The choice of topics for the case studies is good: reconnaissance missions, wireless networks, virus infections, denial of service attacks, HIPAA, computer forensics, etc. I learned a lot from the book and enjoyed myself while learning. The book will also serve as a good reference. I imagine I will refer to it quite often as I solve problems that are similar to the ones covered in the book. Definitely a five-star book in my opinion.	2004-12-22

I guess I don't really care about a couple overgrown boys who love comic books. I work with them everyday, though in modern times, it's video games that they like. To me a hero isn't someone who can leap tall building but, rather, someone who overcomes personal demons to become a stronger person who can care for other people. In other words, a female. :-)<BR>I am finding this book especially disappointing because I liked Wonder Boys. I admit that I don't plan to put it down, even though I might skim some of the longer paragraphs and give up on looking up the annoyingly obscure words that I've never seen before. But I find it kind of irritating that it's good enough for me not to want to give up on it but not good enough for me to thoroughly it.	2004-04-12

The second edition still has all the good material from the first edition about flow analysis and requirements analysis. It also has additional information related to network architectures. The new material on architectures for security and privacy is especially relevant to today's environment.<br />I appreciated the explanations of why a systematic approach to network design is even more relevant today than ever due to the complexity of systems, applications, requirements, and even users who are much more sophisticated than they once were. Network engineers who throw capacity at the problem with little analysis should read the book to understand the risks associated with this &quot;methodology.&quot; As McCabe states, delay may be as important as capacity; and reliability, maintainability, and availability are often more important than overall throughput. Also, a network designer should practice due diligence in developing reproducible solutions that can be proven to meet the project goals.<br />I like the Preparation section at the beginning of each chapter. The author talks about the prerequisites for understanding the material in the chapter and lists books that the reader can check out first to gain the requisite knowledge. The author applied hierarchy (a theme in the book) even to the list of references! This is a better way of doing a bibliography than the linear list at the end of books that you so often see.<br />My only minor complaint is that I never did get used to RMA standing for reliability, maintainability, and availability. Every time I saw the acronym I had to try to remember what it stood for. But that's minor compared to my overall &quot;thumbs-up&quot; reaction to the book.	2004-01-07

How could she have let this get out when it was so bad? Is she that callous about her reputation that she doesn't care how badly it is tainted by the truly awful writing in this book? The writing is disjointed, muddled, and awkward. The characters are boring and whine too much. There are some cute lines from the Harry character. I suspect those lines were all she really had in mind when she started writing. But all writers know that you don't just spew out words and then you're finished!<br />This never would have been accepted by a publisher if it weren't by Anne Lamott who has otherwise written all marvelous books.	2003-12-20

My husband thought I had gone nuts, but he had to admit he liked the point-of-view examples too, especially since he had just finished reading the premiere stream-of-consciousness book, &quot;Ulysses,&quot; by James Joyce. I don't think I'll ever forget Phil and George and Octavio and their little trip to the saunas of Finland!<br />The book is practical too, with useful advice on working with characters, plot, scenes, and revising. The book is also a sensible wake-up call for writers who think a book will sell on its merits. It won't. Writing is a business. Marketing and working with publishers is 1/2 the job of having a successful book and writing career. A lot of writers want to hide in their loft and scribble all day. Unfortunately, we will never read their work.<br />The most important message in the book is not about writing. It's &quot;be a nice person.&quot; That might seem obvious, but how many people really follow it? Be charming, humble, courteous, friendly, and don't whine. Well, Carolyn See says it much better than I do. Read the book! :-)	2003-03-19

With this book, half the battle is won because you at least know how to do the planning. You still have to do the planning, but with the worksheets and tips provided in the book, that will be much easier than it used to be.<br />I read the book twice: once to get an idea of what all the worksheets were about and once to really read them with all the technical and practical details provided by Greenberg.<br />Greenberg identifies 28 security elements, including 15 fundamental elements, (six of which are core elements), and 13 wrap-up elements. Core elements include things like authorization and access control, authentication, encryption, integrity, nonrepudiation, and privacy. Those may seem obvious, but Greenberg has a lot of useful things to say about them that others haven't said.<br />Perhaps the most valuable part of the book is all the other elements, which we tend to forget, including addressing and routing (with tips on how to get those right from a security point of view), configuration management, directory services, time services, staff management, legal issues, and so on.<br />I'd be interested to see some projects get implemented with Greenberg's methods. I think it should work quite well, although due to entropy, laziness, over-worked engineers, and other such factors, I would guess that some of the numerous worksheets will fall by the wayside. But I think Greenberg would be OK with that as long as most of the worksheets are maintained and the company adopts security as a way of thinking.<br />In summary, this book is definitely worth reading, probably numerous times!	2003-03-08

It also has useful information on where to place PIX firewalls in your network design and how to ensure their configuration implements your security policy. I've never met the author or corresponded with him, so this isn't one of those &quot;friends of the author&quot; reviews. :-) Nonetheless, I do highly recommend the book.<br />Chapter 1 is a good introduction to what a firewall is and the different types of firewalls, including information on how to classify a PIX. In addition to Chapter 1, there's a nice insert in the middle of the book that encapsulates the most useful information regarding what a PIX does and how. I've never seen a book that has this sort of &quot;executive summary&quot; insert, or perhaps we could call it a crib for decrypting the rest of the book!? Seriously, the book doesn't need much decryption. One of its best features is its easy-to-follow style. Deal is an excellent writer.<br />Following the helpful introduction is a description of the PIX firewall product family line, which is important when working with Cisco products, since Cisco has a seemingly infinite number of products. Chapter 3 follows those chapters and offers a concise description of the PIX command-line interface.<br />The most valuable chapters are the ones that follow because they describe how a PIX works as far as its handling of traffic flow, address translation, filtering, fixing of problematic protocols, and support for VPNs. There are some minor errors with regards to protocol behavior in these chapters. As is the case with many configuration authors, Deal is not a protocol expert, but the errors do not detract from the book and will hopefully be fixed in a second printing.<br />The book also has a practical section, consisting of seven chapters, on PIX management, including logging, centralizing security, using PIXes in a redundant fashion, password recovery, and upgrading the PIX.<br />In summary, I found this book useful and readable.	2003-02-18

It covers much more than you need to know for CCNA, but that's OK. It will help you prepare for the more advanced tests also. I used it as the textbook for a class that I taught and was very pleased with its quality, accuracy, and detail. The Foundation Summaries at the end of each chapter were especially helpful for the students. There are a few minor errors, mostly caused by formatting. (For example, in the LAN Headers diagrams, the Control field is not shown to be part of LLC.)

Chapter 2, for example, is a mess. They took the PowerPoint slides that cover protocol behavior and put them at the beginning and then tacked on the appendix from the course, which is essentially Cisco's Internetworking Technologies Overview. The result is that topics are covered twice in different styles.<BR>The descriptions of the figures are wrong. Take Figure 2.3, for example. The description says that it shows ARPs in addition to the 3-way handshake. It doesn't, at least not in the edition I'm reading (1st edition)<BR>One other comment: this is an awfully boring way to study for the exam. The book is really dry with very little added to the course notes and PowerPoint slides from the CIT class. It's also only an exam study guide. It's not like other books which add  some material for actual network administrators, not just exam takers.<BR>One final comment: the tests at the end of the chapters are too basic and don't resemble the questions on the actual Support test in any way.	2002-07-25

Errors abound when discussing the IP header. The Type of Service discussion doesn't distinguish between the TOS field and the TOS bits, whose meaning are obsolete anyway. It doesn't discuss Precedence, which really is used, for exampe, VoIP uses precedence 5. IP source routing, which nobody uses anyway, is explained in a completely muddled way and the example shows someone setting that option when pinging from 10.0.0.60 to 10.0.0.10, which would be a really silly use of the option. The book also has lots of typos and badly-written sentences. Where was the editor? You would think Prentice Hall could hire editors. The SPX chapter starts with this, &quot;The SPX/IPX protocol is a still a common occurrence on many corporate networks.&quot; The only mention of AppleTalk is in the list of Application-layer protocols where it has two entries that say this: AppleTalk and Appleshare apples networking protocol suite AFP apples protocol for remote file access AppleTalk shoudn't be in the list and couldn't they have used an editor who knew what Apple means in the computer industry?	2001-04-23

As any WAN engineer can tell you, the most important challenges require a broader understanding. Designing a reliable WAN requires an understanding of fault-tolerance options, QoS, and security. This book covers those topics, along with load distribution, MPLS, NAT, tunneling, and &quot;virtualization.&quot; The Layer-7 virtualization section provides useful tips for understanding Web caches, application-specific caches, proxies, and stateful packet screening.<br />&quot;WAN Survival Guide&quot; is part of the Networking Council Series from Wiley Computer Publishing and it meets the goals of that series well. The Networking Council, which includes luminaries such as Vint Cerf and Scott Bradner, produces books that offer real-world guidance for experienced network engineers. These books don't reiterate the technical details that you can get from RFCs, vendor white papers, or reference books. Instead they present new ways of thinking about options, so that an engineer can compare and contrast technologies using business practices that the author has found useful.<br />I recommend this book, both because it is enjoyable to read, (especially the Schwarzenegger laws of networking), and because it is practical and unique.	2001-04-07

The book demonstrates the author's detailed understanding of the relevant standards, protocols, and implementation issues, including VoIP, VoATM, VoFR, SS7, digital and analog voice, QoS, etc.<br />Don't be thrown off by the 800 pages. The author is such a great writer that he manages to explain everything so that anyone can understand it. But he doesn't over-simplify to the point of being wrong, like some authors. (Some of the first books that came out on voice/data were basically the author's PowerPoint slides ported to book format, errors and over-simplifications included.)

This time is called serialization delay  and it is relevant for low-speed interfaces where delay-sensitive voice  packets might need to wait a long time while a long frame is pushed out the  interface, at say, 64 Kbps.

It helped me see the gifts of midlife, and  provided practical advice on entering midlife without any self-defeating  regrets about the aging process. I recommend this book to anyone going  through a &quot;mid-life&quot; crisis, regardless of their age.	1998-10-24

The ARP mistakes are the obvious problem. But there are quite a few other  technical mistakes also. I questioned the likelihood of a network having  10,000 broadcasts per second. If each frame was 128 bytes, this would be  more than 10 Mbps Ethernet. Also, IGMP stuff is bogus. And all mentions of  calculating bandwidth usage are strange because they say things like 7  Mbytes instead of 7Mbytes/sec.	1998-09-04
