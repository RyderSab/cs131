No, not my customers, but my employees. Like most people, I spend all of my energies trying to communicate with and market to new clients, and then I focus on existing clients. I just don't spend enough time communicating with my own employees and then I get surprised when they can't read my mind. <br /> <br />\\"Light Their Fire\\" goes beyond generalities about the need to communicate better to internal employees. It gives you step-by-step ways of making internal branding a part of every thing you do. Whether it is videoconferencing or setting up employee email newsletters, this book tells you what to do, how to maximize its effectiveness and then gives great success case studies. <br /> <br />I am often suspicious of books written by several authors, but \\"Light Their Fire\\" doesn't have the voice of a dumbed-down committee. Instead, the lively personalities of each writer spill out on page after page. This was the most fun I've had reading a business book in a long time. <br />	2005-06-22
