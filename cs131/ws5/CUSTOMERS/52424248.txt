This is the story of a lady that spent 40+ years on the road doing tour after tour after tour because she was in a loveless unhappy marriage. Her abusive husband was living high off the hog with his male lover while she was out performing all over America. She had a terrible life until her husband's death...and only recently she met her current husband, a wonderful loving millionnaire whom she dated originally in Junior high. It's a fascinating story which you will not find in the book.	2004-10-09

Both books feature a teacher who lusts after teenage boys, a trip by this teacher to a non-English speaking &quot;old world&quot; country and an unusual blend of historical fiction, unabashed erotica, and Proustian pyrotechnics.<br />The writing is quite wonderful in this book, but is not as dense or as high-brow as Hollinghurst's. Instead of impressing us with his vocabulry, Stadler brings a unique gay American sensibility to the novel, which gives it quite a different sensibility than Hollinghurst's. <br />While both writers will obviously be compared to Proust and to Mann, I find both Holinghurst and Stadler to be reminiscent of A.S. Byatt. Just like in some of Byatt's writing, the search for historical truth also parallels the search for truth in one's own life. I definitely recommend this book, although If I were to only read one of them, I would read the better book, The Folding Star	2000-10-16

Do read this book before reading &quot;The Folding  Star&quot;, Hollinghurst's masterpiece. While The Swimming Pool Library is  very, very good, it is &quot;The Folding Star&quot; that will convince you  of Hollinghurst's status among the greats of English literature.	1998-11-25
