Still, much is of great<BR>use to teachers; the standard textbooks are often<BR>redundant in their figures and thus bore students<BR>in their predictability.  As well, students are in<BR>need of stretching their mathematical intuitions<BR>and understanding -- when all right triangles are<BR>shown with the legs parallel to the pages' sides,<BR>when all variables are either x or y, people think<BR>that math is a matter of grinding through standard<BR>procedures.  PROOFS WITHOUT WORDS II links<BR>subjects that are usually treated disparately:<BR>geometry is connected to combinatorics (a fancy<BR>name for counting), calculus, and linear algebra. <BR>Many of the most technical figures are accompanied<BR>by equations and words explaining the use.  The<BR>back cover blurb does admit that many of the<BR>proofs aren't actually wordless, but I'm sure no<BR>one will sue them for false advertising -- these<BR>problems would be difficult to interpret<BR>otherwise.<br />However, the math enthusiast will be most rewarded<BR>by the figures with the least amount of words, for<BR>they provide mini-mysteries to be solved.  The<BR>book starts with six different figures proving the<BR>Pythagorean Theorem -- and only one has any kind<BR>of &quot;language&quot; on it (a few variables and their<BR>products).  These examples' author range from a<BR>10th century Arab mathematician, a 3rd century<BR>Chinese mathematician, and Leonardo da Vinci to<BR>current contributors to the journals from the<BR>Mathematical Association of America.  A few of<BR>these proofs are easier to interpret, as they<BR>involve cutting up squares into various pieces and<BR>rearranging them (but how to prove these<BR>various pieces are congruent?), one uses similar<BR>triangles, and the da Vinci one still has me in a<BR>fog.  The Arabic proof was very elegant and<BR>involves a tiling pattern that looks like it would<BR>work well on a modern kitchen floor.  The most<BR>elegant of all the proofs in the book is the one<BR>on the front cover: a geometric series represented<BR>by stacked equilateral triangles, fitting inside a<BR>larger triangle.  The combinatorics proofs are<BR>also very elegant ways to visualize special sums<BR>and numbers.<br />None of these figures would be considered proofs<BR>by most people because one needs to have various<BR>parts explained; however, all crucial parts of the<BR>proofs are in the figures.  As the editor writes,<BR>what makes these proofs good is that they show<BR>=why= a statement is true.  Many<BR>mathematicians discover new theorems by playing<BR>around with figures representing already known<BR>objects -- some of these figures can show how<BR>certain relations were discovered.  Unfortunately,<BR>we are usually shown a cleaned-up, perfectly<BR>deductive version of theorems in school, making it<BR>difficult for us to make the leap to new<BR>mathematical discoveries and understandings.  The<BR>figures in this book make for a good course of<BR>mental calisthenics, and they provide inspiration<BR>to one to find one's own visualizations.<br />I recommend this book for high school and college<BR>math teachers, particularly those who teach<BR>trigonometry, calculus, and discrete math. If you<BR>know a student gifted in math, this book is<BR>appropriate for any student who is familiar with<BR>some basic geometry (Pythagorean Theorem, area of<BR>triangles and rectangles, similar triangles); they<BR>will be able to figure out a few of the counting<BR>and geometry proofs, and will grow into the other<BR>figures in time.  For the intelligent child who<BR>enjoys math, this provides an extra challenge, and<BR>as they learn the math various proofs refer to,<BR>the pieces will fall into place.	2003-02-25
US	52761439	R26FO4YU8IXTI3	0316116726	182280380	Connections	Books	3	19	27	N	N	A Good Introduction to Technology History	If you've seen James Burke's TV program of the same name, or his<BR>short-lived Scientific American column, you might be taken aback by the<BR>relatively slower pacing of this book.  I found that in the TV program<BR>and the magazine column, Mr. Burke ricocheted from colorful personality<BR>or idea to another, in a confusing, dazzling, and ultimately<BR>entertaining way -- giving one the idea that the history of innovation<BR>is that of one large web, but one doesn't get the larger cast of events.<br />However, in the book, he slows down and spends pages upon the<BR>developemnt of infantry tactics and the effects of the use of guns in<BR>battle in Medieval and Renaissance warfare.  This book is simply a<BR>history of technology, told in 9 separate, large arcs, coming full<BR>circle from the tenuous and interconnected energy system that resulted<BR>in the unexpected 1965 Northeast American Blackout -- which is used as a<BR>metaphor for the development of technology as a whole.<br />More to the point, this book centers more on the overall social aspects<BR>and developments of different societies; Mr. Burke is British, so one<BR>sees how he comes back again and again to point out how England sprung<BR>ahead or fell behind in certain developments, and why.  He does mention<BR>a few more flamboyant personalities in this history, but his thrust is<BR>that techonological progress is more a function of being in the right<BR>location at the right time, and combining the right concepts from those<BR>who came before.  As well, he focuses on how technological change<BR>affects society: population and wealth fluctuations due to supply<BR>bottlenecks, how fireplaces broke up the communal manor and inspired<BR>courtly love traditions, how lack of social mobility stifled progress in<BR>England and how cheap land in America meant the first factory works here<BR>would be young women.<br />Sometimes Burke gets mired in the details of the way some of<BR>technological innovations work (I can't quite follow some of the<BR>explanations of how clockworks tick), but it gives one a wider<BR>perspective on what was possible at what time.  It's true that each<BR>chapter works chronologically, but overall the arc of the book is not<BR>chronological, but thematic.  This is not a scholarly text.  However,<BR>this is a good introduction to the history of Western technology - its<BR>connections and its impacts.	2002-06-04

This book made me regain my faith in and admiration of the beauty of math, art, music, and the universe -- the beauty that is almost never shown in a class or revealed in a &quot;scholarly&quot; work; after reading it, the isolation of those subjects from the rest of the conceptual world seems simply ludicrous. Each time in reading I am challenged to discover more connections, more self-references, more meaning in the several subjects presented. In short, reading this book is like a religious experience for me -- I love it. <br />From GEB: &quot;The Buddhist allegory of 'Indra's Net' tells of an endless net of threads throughout the universe...At every crossing of threads is an individual and every individual is a crystal bead. The great light of 'Absolute Being' illuminates and penetrates every crystal bead; moreover, every crystal bead reflects not only the light from every other crystal in the net -- but also every reflection of every reflection throughout the universe.&quot; <br />Hofstadter's book is the perfect example of one of those crystal beads; Hofstadter portrays (or &quot;reflects&quot;) several subjects in his work, e.g., formal systems, Zen, moplecular biology, the art of fugues and canons, model of the brain, various geometries, number theory, Holism vs. Reductionism, and much more, and then shows the &quot;reflections&quot; of the subjects in one another -- truly a large task. For the most part, he comes across quite well; his dialogues which encapsulate and discuss ideas to be presented, his &quot;dogmaps&quot; which outline parallel ideas and &quot;map&quot; them onto one another, and his relatively simple language enable him to communicate his ideas quite easily. However, this book is quite weighty -- almost 800 pages long, full of digressions and perspective-blowing ideas; many ideas and underlying themes must be sought out within the dialogues, many open-ended questions are left for the reader to ponder. If you aren't used to flexible or abstract thinking, and you don't want to work very hard in reading, this book isn't for you.<br /> GEB is an unique &quot;nonfiction&quot; book -- it does not address one subject, or even several &quot;closely related&quot; subjects. Even though published in 1979, many parts deal with research still going on today [this is still true in 2001, as it was in 1990]. For example, Hofstadter presents a possible model for a brain to be used in artificial intelligence in computers -- one of many models being studied today in that field. In one short section, he presents recursive graphs that were generated in theoretical experiments -- graphs that bear some similarity to the modern study of fractals. Especially in the area of computer science, Hofstadter leaves several goals for people to attain -- goals that may never be realized, but perhaps goals that will enlighten us as we seek to attain them. <br />The ideas in this book shall live long past its authorr; I can say no more but that the people who awarded the Pulitzer Prize to this book made no mistake.	2001-08-27

We have the cultural history of bananas!	<br />Who would have thought there was so much to say about the modern love affair between America and bananas? I should have known it, though, for at Mathcamp the staff had entire wars based on bananas and the pilfering thereof. We snuck extras out of the cafeteria, hid them in refrigerators, even wrote our names on the peels in a feeble attempt to secure a personal, steady supply. Alas, it was not to be. How did this miracle fruit go from being an exotic food iteam for the rich to the universal snack? Jenkins tells us how, in this very thoroughly researched book. Pretty much anything you want to know about bananas in the 20th century is here: medical attitudes, recipes, social status, trade wars, banana jokes (&quot;I'm sorry, I can't hear you -- I've got a banana in my ear.&quot;) - you name it, it's in here, which is surprising for such a relatively trim book. She's got a slew of references in the back, should you ever wish to check her sources; for the less academic of us, there's also an extensive list of banana songs. <br />Bananas are such a workaday fruit, we forget how important they have been in reflecting society. With each new medical fad, bananas reinvent themselves as a perfect food; during the period where dirty fruit was a concern, the thick peel of the banana was a boon; when vitamins, minerals, and proteins were seen as important, bananas were found to have such things in abundance; when high-calories and high-fat were a concern, bananas were found to be an energy-full, low-fat snack. Even stranger, at one point in history, bananas were considered a treatment for celiac disease (an extreme form of gluten-intolerance - so basically all breads and grains are inedible to such children, and many died due to malnutrition); during World War II, during which much of the banana supply was cut off, there were stories of frantic parents mobilizing entire towns to round up banana supplies for their sick children, sure that their children would die without bananas. And yet, in just a generation previous, parents had been warned against giving =any= raw fruits or vegetables to children under the age of 7. The chapter in which this fascinating material resides is called &quot;Peril and Panacea&quot;, which provides a prismatic view of the changing medical atmosphere in America in the 20th century. A few other details which I found interesting: there were banana cookbooks, one of the recipes being for &quot;Bananas and Bacon&quot; - I kid you not. There's even a picture of it in the book. As well, much of the editorial cartoons and jokes involving banana peels reflected anti-immigrant sentiment, once bananas had become so cheap even the newly arrived poor could afford to eat them. Of course, there are a couple of obligatory &quot;banana as phallus&quot; remarks (explaining why proper young women were to use a knife and fork to eat the offending fruit), but they do not overwhelm. Sometimes a banana is just a banana. <br /> The only other fruit that could possibly have had as much impact on the American psyche is the apple (well, maybe the orange). Though this is a history book, it is far from dry, and Jenkins lets off a couple zingers of her own. If you've ever eaten a banana or know someone who has, this book is for you; so I guess that means about everyone. I have no idea, then, why this isn't at the top of the bestseller list.	2001-08-25

This novel was expanded from a short story by Card, and it shows; the plot, at its core, is simply this: a Mormon family moves to central North Carolina, has some troubles and makes enemies, all the while boys are going missing in the neighborhood. They find out what has happened to the boys. That's it in a nutshell, and as my husband remarked, this novel is obviously taking the background of a short story and pushing it into the foreground. That does =not= mean it's boring or lagging; Card uses this opportunity to create a fully-fleshed family, enmeshed in various communities (the Mormon Church, a computer software company, a medium-sized southern town), so that the plot has overall personal meaning. <br />On a personal note of my own, having grown up in medium-sized southern towns with a father who worked for IBM when the IBM PC came out, I was brought back to my childhood, when my favorite fast food place in the Savannah Mall was Der Weinerschnitzel, when I was disappointed in my Commodore VIC-20 and its tape drive, when I had to battle through swarms of bugs just to get to my backyard swingset. Card nails the details perfectly, especially the kind of resentment one can get as a gifted child growing up in &quot;advantaged&quot; circumstances; I had no Mrs. Jones in my past, but I very well could have. I've seen other children treated as Stevie was, and there's little a child can do about a teacher who hates children. On another detail note, I'm sure the episodes with the bugs were intended to be creepy, and I'm sure Card thought the armies of bugs that greeted him in Greensboro were daunting, but I just had to laugh about it. My lord, I used to eat South Carolina =dirt= as a child, which is full of dead bugs. I'm supposed to be scared by a bunch of crickets pouring through a rotten baseboard? <br />Seriously though, there are so many moral triumphs in this book, in which parents under extreme pressure try their best to protect their family, in many cases succeeding and in many cases and in a few, not being able to do much about the external world, but achieving a moral victory nonetheless. It also gave me ideas in how to deal with certain people, so literature can actually be useful now and then! Card has always presented one of the most accurate pictures of how religion acts in people's lives, especially from the point of view of a person of faith. In particular, I enjoyed learning a little more about how the Mormon social structure actually works, which of the duties people actually follow up on, and which they let slide (Sunday services and classes seem well-attended, but things like home teaching were given short shrift). Being a Catholic, I know how comforting a Church with an international structure can be -- instant community whereever you go -- but some of the duties can be shortchanged depending on local attitudes.<br /> I spent much of the book wondering how much autobiography was in this story, as the actual origin of this book was a bedtime story Card made up for his son, Charlie Ben, who is echoed in the birth of the Fletchers' son Zap. Card had grown up in the west, done mission work in Brazil, and moved to Greensboro, NC which looks (to me, a Raleighite) alot like the fictional Steuben, NC. Card has been one of my favorite authors for so long, I was somewhat distracted by so much I could tell came directly from his own life. I can tell what a personal book this was, and anyone reading it for the human story will be well-rewarded.	2001-08-25
US	52761439	R1YPODNG5N0BZ1	0553578375	599855363	Jane and the Stillroom Maid: Being the Fifth Jane Austen Mystery (Being A Jane Austen Mystery)	Books	3	6	7	N	N	Regency mystery, with fewer historical distractions	Barron's fictional Jane continues her surprisingly dangerous career by stumbling upon a particularly grisly corpse -- a young man, she thinks, shot in the head and eviscerated.  As it comes out that the deceased was a stillroom maid, in charge of remedies and preserves, and a vicious rumor implicating the Freemasons spreads throughout the village, Jane once again becomes enmeshed with a murder investigation.  There are plenty of false leads to follow, plenty of scandals to uncover, and all in the company of Lord Harold Trowbridge, who is in Derbyshire to pay a visit of morning for the Duchess of Devonshire.<br />Of the Jane Austen Mystery series so far, this is the one most distilled - fewer side issues for Jane to consider, fewer forays into the politics and the culture of the day.  There is, of course, the aristocratic name-dropping; we are treated to the leading people of the Whig movement in Parliament.  Also, there is a small mention of Freemasonry, but it passes quickly.  The chapters are interspersed with recipes for folk remedies, in sure opposition to the &quot;more modern&quot; apothecary and doctor, who prefer their bleeding cures to tinctures and poultices (Warning: do not try these remedies at home.  Stick to our &quot;modern&quot; remedies of St. John's Wort and saw palmetto).  However, there are far fewer footnotes in this book than the previous novels and far fewer reveries on Jane's part.  Barron seems to have decided to make this a murder mystery, with few distracting elements.  Once again, an enjoyable read, like the rest of the series, but no tedious bits as some of the previous novels suffered from.	2001-07-18
US	52761439	R2XPPLKBMWD09K	0061093998	350955066	Homebody	Books	3	0	1	N	N	A living and dying house	This book is standard Orson Scott Card fare -- people with very concrete, contemporary problems, people with mysterious pasts, a protagonist a little too good, and a little bit of folk magic thrown in.  I wasn't surprised to find that the &quot;house come alive&quot; (a horror subgenre, perhaps born of authors building homes and realizing the way these things suck up time, money, and spirit) wasn't exactly malevolent, but it wasn't benevolent either.  Above all, there's a consistent atmosphere of haunting throughout this book - Don Lark, the main character, is haunted by the death of his daughter in a car accident caused by his ex-wife, haunted by a situation which he had tried everything he legally could and yet still unable to prevent.  The trio of elderly neighbors next door (one unseen upstairs, consuming an unbelievable amount of food) are haunted by the house, trying to get Don to at the very least let the house decay instead of renovating it.  <br />The harking on the past of the house, repeatedly back to the Bellamy's - the original builders and happy owners of this now seemingly ominous decaying hulk, back to the impotent choices or horrible compulsions of various characters - made me feel like this was a ghost story without an actual ghost.  I found I was wrong.  However, when the ghost did finally show, it was barely a surprise; this house =had= to have a ghost.<br />An interesting characteristic of all Card novels is that he does give peeks of truly evil people, but he never exposes the reader to them for long.  That's a good idea on his part, for when an oily, insinuating character appears, my blood pressure shoots up as I wish to throttle the nonexistent person.  Card prefers to linger on those who are essentially good, but who have gone through extremely harrowing trials and who are left in mental and emotional confusion in the wake of evil results.  <br />So, no, this isn't a horror novel, and not exactly a fantasy book, for all the animistic forcesat work in this novel.  It's a story of people trying to escape their pasts, but unable to for many years, and then coming together to, as a group, conquer the spirits holding them prisoners.  It's a quick read (I finished it in one evening) and it has a satisfying ending.  I would recommend this book for a rainy summer Sunday, a book for one of those days in which one would otherwise be living in one's own mind.	2001-07-17

First of all, the &quot;secrets&quot; of the first novel are given away, and thus lessen the impact of surprise one gets on first reading =Ender's Game=.  Secondly, the characterization and plotting in =Ender's Shadow= surpasses the original novel; a lot of time has passed since Card wrote his wildly popular book, and he has used his intervening time well in improving his craft as a storyteller.<br />Like =Ender's Game=, =Ender's Shadow= is a story about an execeptional child trying to fit in and succeed, in which the child has a nemesis who haunts his thoughts, and an advocate who seems to betray him.  Upon multiple readings of both novels, more and more parallels pop out; however, I find the characters of Ender and Bean to be extremely different.  Ender seems to sink further and further inside himself, as he tries to protect himself from the dangers which threaten him from outside; Bean starts as a cold, survival machine, remnant of his battles to stay alive on the streets of Rotterdam as a toddler, but as he moves on he reaches out to protect himself from his own external dangers.  As Ender becomes more obsessed with the Buggers, Bean keeps thinking about the wider world, and the inevitable wars on Earth that would result from defeating the Buggers.  At the end of the novel, Ender is about to leave Earth forever, to start on his long journey away from humanity as =Speaker for the Dead=; Bean returns to Earth to a new family and a new sense of purpose and humanity.<br />It does not matter that one knows what happens in =Ender's Game=; Card realized that Ender's point of view on Battle School and the world as a whole was extremely myopic.  One finds new significance to dialogues between Ender and Bean, knowing the limitations both have in knowledge of the other.  I'm glad Card revisited the story of Ender and has extended it to the period on Earth right after the Bugger War, which was glossed over in the Ender series.  Bean's series continues with =Shadow of the Hegemon=, and the parallel stories have ended.  If nothing else, one can note the maturation of Card as an author in the time between =Ender's Game= and =Ender's Shadow=, with more complex characterization and a sharper contrast of good vs. evil, =Ender's Shadow= definitely comes out on top.	2001-07-16

Jane attends Canterbury Race Day with some of the Austen clan, witnessing the excitement over straining horses, and being shocked by Mrs. Grey, a rich Frenchwoman with a good taste in racehorses, a genius at shocking the populace, and the bad fate to end up brutally strangled by Race Day's end.  Once again, our fictional Jane is close to the investigative action -- this time, it's her brother Neddie, local magistrate, who is in charge of discovering the murderer.  There is an obvious suspect, the man who owned the carriage in which Mrs. Grey's body was found (scandalously undressed!), but Mrs. Grey had made enemies of much of the people of the Kentish neighborhood.<br />As is usual, Stephanie Barron weaves in cultural information of the day -- one starts with some knowledge of the low pursuits of cock-fighting, high-stakes card parties, and speculation on horseracing, but by novel's end one has learned of the new perspectives in landscaping &quot;improvement&quot;, a bit on current women's fashions, British troop movements in holding off Napolean's armies, and the financial ramifications of the Napoleanic wars in general.  Not all of the historical information is pleasant to learn; Barron reminds us a little bit too often of the August heat making it a necessity for quick inquests and burials.  I'm sure the coroners of England were happy when the inquest jury no longer had to examine the corpse for themselves.  <br />As an avid reader of Agatha Christie, I figured out a few of the mystery's puzzles early on, but though I could tell =how= the murder was done, I couldn't tell =who= did it.  There are some odd, distracting bits of plot, I believe; however, I do appreciate the little bit of =Emma= that was stolen for the use of this book.  It makes for interesting pitfalls; a devoted Janeite will be able to recognize phrases, dialogue, and plot taken from Austen's works, but Barron uses them for her own end and the unwary reader can be caught in surprise twists to the Austen originals.  I found the ending of the novel somewhat unsatisfying, but the novel as a whole is entertaining.	2001-07-16
US	52761439	RSBOOQN4ZK4PR	0553578170	833483533	Jane and the Wandering Eye: Being the Third Jane Austen Mystery	Books	3	6	6	N	N	Murder Amongst Actors and Artists	The book opens on a masquerade in honor of an acting company, with our fictional Jane Austen in the guise of a Shepardess, and the scene ends with a murdered Harlequin, stabbed during a dramatic soliloquy from Macbeth (the &quot;cursed play&quot;).  Harlequin turns out to be Richard Portal, manager of the troupe.  A young man is standing over the body, knife in hand, but all is not as it seems, as is usual in mystery books.<br />It turns out this young man is a relative of Lord Harold, Jane's old nemesis-turned-ally from the first of the Jane Mysteries.  Lord Harold and Miss Austen comb the worlds of acting, staging a scene of their own in order to rifle Mr. Portal's papers, and of artistry, as it turns out that the &quot;Wandering Eye&quot; of the title, a mysterious, expensively-made eye portrait had been found on the corpse.  As is usual in Ms. Barron's Jane mysteries, one learns much of the cultural history of the Regency period -- the tumultuous politics of the time, the fashions in dress and affectation (Jane runs into some of the dandies of the day), and the ways in which people's reputations her broadcast (imagine, they had gossip columns -- one can't blame current media for starting the practice of nosing into people's private lives!)<br />I found the solution to the mystery a little disappointing, but the characters much more interesting than in the two previous books.  Jane and her sister Cassandra's relationship strains with their increasing age and obvious spinsterhood, Jane reacts to the smearing of her own good name, and Jane loses a very close friend.  Ms. Barron has done an excellent job of weaving Jane Austen's real biography (and actual words - I noted several phrases from Austen's own novels and letters inserted liberally into the text) into dramatic action.  I think Jane herself would have found these books amusing; we now think of Austen as having a retired, uneventful life, and these books paint a portrait very different.  The queen of irony would have smirked.	2001-07-13
US	52761439	R29G0CK6SOH0V7	0201558025	891194854	Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science (2nd Edition)	Books	5	276	285	N	N	Please Be Discrete	What is &#34;concrete&#34; math, as opposed to other types of math?  The authors explain that the title comes from the blending of CONtinuous and disCRETE math, two branches of math that many seem to like to keep asunder, though each occurs in the foundation of the other.  The topics in the book, such as sums, generating functions, and number theory, are actually standard discrete math topics; however, the treatment in this text shows the inherent continuous (read: calculus) undergirding of the topics.  Without calculus, generating functions would not have come to mind and their tremendous power could not be put to use in figuring out series.  The smart-aleck marginal notes notwithstanding, this is a serious math book for those who are willing to dot every i and cross every t.  Unlike most math texts (esp. graduate math texts), nothing is omitted along the way.  Notation is explained (=very= important), common pitfalls are pointed out (as opposed to the usual way students come across them -- by getting back bleeding exams), and what is important and what is =not= as important are indicated.  Still, I cannot leave the marginal notes unremarked; some are serious warnings to the reader.  For example, in the introduction, one note remarks &#34;I would advise the casual student to stay away from this course.&#34;  Notes that advise one to skim, and there are a few, should be taken seriously.  All the marginal notes come from the TAs who had to help with the text, and thus have a more nitty-gritty understanding of the difficulties students are likely to face.  Still, there are plenty of puns and bad jokes to amuse the text-reader for hours: &#34;The empty set is pointless,&#34; &#34;But not Imbesselian,&#34; and &#34;John .316&#34; made me chuckle, but you have to find them for yourself.  To someone who has been through the rigors of math grad school, this book is a delight to read; to those who have not, they must keep in mind that this is a serious text and must be prepared to do some real work.  Very bright high school students have gotten through this text with little difficulty.  I want to note ahead of time - some of the questions in the book are serious research topics.  They don't necessarily tell you that when they give you the problem; if you've worked on the problem for a week, you should turn to the answers in the back to check that there really is a solution.  That said, I would highly recommend this book to math-lovers who want some rigorous math outside of the usual fare.  The formulas in here can actually come in handy &#34;in real life&#34;, especially if one has to use math a lot.	2001-07-13

It starts innocently enough - some simple-sounding problems on socks in drawers, flipping coins, and rolling dice.  Soon enough, you end up with paper black with numbers and pictures of a flipping coin (how thick does a coin need to be so that it lands on its =side= with probability 1/3?)  If you get drawn in deep (as I did), you may even wonder what probability really means.<br />Some of the problems are classic, such as the problem of how many people would it take for the probability that at least two of them have the same birthday is greater than a half (I'll give this answer away: 23.  But do you know why?)  One of the dice problems actually recalls the history of the development of probability as a separate mathematical field -- problem #19, involving dice bets that Samuel Pepys asked Isaac Newton to figure out.  Some of the problems are simply openers for entire vistas in probability - avoid problems #51 and #52 if you wish to not become enmeshed in concerns of random walks (remember that one of Einstein's earliest papers was on Brownian motion - a molecular random walk.)  I used problem #25, which deal with &quot;random chords on a circle&quot;, to explore this classic probability paradox - I've ended up with three different figures, all of which seem plausible!  It gets deep to what one means by &quot;random chord&quot;.<br />This book, though so thin, is inexhaustible in spawning disturbing questions about probability; even more useful is that there are questions for people at =any= level of knowledge of probability.  Those who wish to think about &quot;counting&quot; problems (like those involving rolling dice, or pulling balls out of urns) will find those here. Those who have an interest in continuous probability willfind problems which will interest them.  And those old probability pros who ponder the essence of chance will find meat for some productive chewing.	2001-07-03

This book, written in 1954, is just as pertinent today (perhaps even more so, as it's so easy to acquire statistics due to our current technology) -- Darrell Huff gives people the tools to talk back to statistics.  Though there is a little bit about deliberate deception, in such things as &quot;The Gee-Whiz Graph&quot; (about how the graphical display of statistics can be twisted so that one can get any desired result, though the stats aren't changed), the meat of the book is regarding sound statistical reasoning, something that people today really need to consider.<br />For example, every person who listens to the latest survey showing a correlation between certain food and certain health problems or benefits should read &quot;Post Hoc Rides Again&quot;, in which people erroneously leap from statistical correlation to a cause-and-effect relationship.  An example given in the book is a report in which it was found that smokers had lower grades in college; ergo, said the researcher, smokers wishing to improve their grades should quit smoking!  Of course, a statistical study showing that there's a &quot;significant&quot; relation between smoking and low grades doesn't show which causes the other -- perhaps educational failure draws people to smoke!  My own theory would be that the =type= of person who is given to smoking is also given to not doing well in school; instead of cause and effect, one has a correlation from a shared, third (and unnamed) cause.   One comes across these fallacies in the news =every=day=; I've been reading my online news, and in the science section I've already found two suspicious cause-and-effect reports.  As Huff notes, it's not the statistics which are in question -- it's how they're used.<br />Some of the figures and examples used are funny due to their datedness (I love the picture of the surveyor asking a doctor what brand of cigarette he smokes, and the cigar-smoking baby just makes me smirk).  It seems to me if you multiply every monetary amount by 10, you might get a better idea as to what it's worth (I don't know what it is actually worth, as I don't know what the inflation from 1954 is (another suspicious statistic)).  <br />More to the point, with the help of this book, you need not have blind faith in the numbers or disgustedly throw all stats away.  The mathematics of statistics guarantees them to have great power, as long as you know how to interpret them correctly.  You might be pleasantly surprised to find that more common sense than math is involved in this book, but the truth is most modern abuse of numbers happens well after the numbers have been calculated.  Of course, once you talk back to statistics people may think you're crazy; at least you won't be fleeced by false reasoning.	2001-07-03

Scarne covers topics such as rules for Draw and Stud Poker, with many variants, some major poker probability principles, money management in poker games, which poker games to avoid, and popular poker cheats (something most poker books ignore).  This book deals exclusively with real poker games, played in a group of people, where the only possible house take is a fixed percentage or amount per pot (and he shows you how to figure out if a commercial poker house is giving you a bum deal).  If you want to learn how to deal with video poker or casino poker games like Caribbean Stud, let me tell you right now -- you can't possibly make money in the long-term playing those games.   Scarne himself will tell you this in one of his other gambling books.<br />There's basic sound advice to be found in this book, advice you will find elsewhere: obvious things such as don't borrow money to play poker, don't play against people highly superior to you at poker, and don't play when drunk or emotional (unless you really want to lose money).  However, there's advice I haven't seen elsewhere (except when they're copying Scarne): ways to prevent common card cheats, ways to calculate whether one should stay in a pot based on pot size versus your odds, and ways to mix up your play, so as to make people uncertain of your style -- so that people will stay in the pot when you've got a sure winner, and so that people will drop out when you're bluffing.  I've used this last bit of advice in playing poker with friends; they know I play close to the vest (I'm very conservative on risk), so when they see me calling &amp; raising bets, they think I know I have a sure thing.  I've gotten away with some pretty horrendous bluffs with this technique.  The name of the game is: don't do it too often.<br />There are complaints about the number of stories Scarne tells about himself (and sometimes he refers to himself by name, and I go back to check who wrote the book.)  Actually, in most of the stories, Scarne's not the central character; rather, some prime poker player is the center of the story.  Some of the stories of the tricks he's performed is rather neat.  But more to the point, I think these stories are good examples of the kinds of tips and strategies he talks about -- he mentions stories of cheats, of bold betting, and of people who have gone from great poker players simply to good, because they lost betting courage and needed to find games more their monetary limit.  More to the point, I feel Scarne is completely justified in &quot;puffing himself up&quot; in these stories of high-roller games and visits to the Merv Griffin show - he can back up his self-promotion with actual knowledge and skill.  Scarne also knew how to write a book that would serve poker players at any level, giving specifics as well as general principles to follow.  For those wishing to improve their games, this should be the first book you get.	2001-07-02
US	52761439	R26L4JY0ROV33O	0817641319	749168475	Math Into LaTeX	Books	3	44	48	N	N	Middle-of-the-road book, covering most LaTeX math needs	Math Into LaTeX is a book with diffuse purpose -- a little bit of introduction for those trying to get into using LaTeX for their mathematical type-setting needs, a little bit of wide coverage on commands needed for many math articles, and plenty of pointing to other references on the Internet and in books.  In many ways, it's too diffuse to be useful on a day-to-day basis; even though there's a Quick Finder, a mini-index at the front of the book, the choices don't seem appropriate for what comes up most often in my hair-pulling sessions with a recalcitrant LaTeX (such as fixing the margin at the top of the page).<br />The first section, titled A Short Course, is a simple 63-page guide, walking one through the creation of a LaTeX file, from a 22-line simple note, to adding individual math terms, to producing large formulas, to dealing with the inevitable error messages, even through running the LaTeX program.  However, it's not really explained how to deal with the dvi file that comes out of the program -- a vague description that a video driver is used to view a dvi file is given in this short course, but the real information is to be found scattered throughout the book.  This is a failing shared with =many= TeX and LaTeX books; one gets in lots of trouble for all that is =not= written down.<br />A quick overview of the remaining sections: in Text and Math one finds the meat of the book -- how to organize text regions, whether in paragraphs or lists; dealing with fonts; how to organize formulas and symbols; how to align equations and their different parts.  I use this section as a reference almost constantly in typing up math articles.  Section III, Document Structure, does a quick look at the overall skeleton of a LaTeX document, and in particular looks at AMS articles.  Customization covers some of the more used customizing options, like changing spacing and counters of list items.  The Long Documents section looks at three things: making bibliographies, making indexes, and pulling separate files together for one large document (like books).  The last section, Math and the Web, talks about various conversions one can use to put up a version of LaTeX documents on the Internet, and how to deal with some PDF issues, but it's rather a spare section.  The appendices, of course, have the standard charts for math symbols and European Accents, lists of fonts, and dealing with conversions.  Check out the Bibliography - if you get a hold of some of the other LaTeX tomes, you will see that it's hard to find a better one than this one (though that doesn't mean a better one can't be written).<br />That said, this has turned out to be one of the most useful LaTeX books I have ever used (the absolutely most useful was a very short book printed by SIAM, and is for people who don't need help with the bare bones).  I own three LaTeX books right now (this one, The Latex Companion, and The Latex Graphics Companion).  Of the three, this one is the most useful in my day-to-day writing of mathematics in LaTeX.  The problem with the Companion books is that they are useful for the esoteric topics they cover, which would be hard to figure out on one's own, but they really don't address nuts &amp; bolts issues like Math Into LaTeX does.  If you can only have one LaTeX book, you should get this one; if you have three LaTex books, you should still get it, for there are few other LaTeX books which make things so understandable and covers so many useful topics.	2001-06-28
US	52761439	R1H002ZO7RRJVP	0872432114	538504408	Daily Readings With Soren Kierkegaard (Daily Readings Series)	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Hard thoughts on love and Christianity	The first, fitting words from the Danish philosopher we see are:<br /> &quot;The whole of existence frightens me, from the smallest fly to the mystery of the Incarnation.&quot;<br />These themes - Kierkegaard's fear and grief, contempt and anger, his view of things as they are and his hope of what they could be - are deeply enmeshed in these few excerpts from the philosopher's journals.  Kierkegaard was, like most people, a person of contradictions - a man striving for faith and closeness to God, even as he finds himself frequenting bars and brothels.<br />Composed of 60 excerpts from Kierkegaard's journals, this book is divided into sections labelled Personal Reflections, The Leap of Faith, Works of Love, Training in Christianity, Attack on Christendom, and Prayers.  Most of the excerpts are his thoughts on Christianity and Christ as human and divine, but there is plenty for non-Christians to think on.  In his section on Works of Love, emotional, or passionate, love is compared with everlasting love.  The first, says Kierkegaard, fools us into believing it is the stronger, for it burns bright; as time moves on, though, jealousy and habit can turn such passionate love into hate or contempt.  In The Leap of Faith section, Kierkegaard speaks to every person who believes in God or things beyond rational experience.<br />Most of these selections seem negative, depressing in their view of people seeking comfort in their outward shows, content not to probe too far into truth, but a ribbon of hope and yearning laces through it all.  In hopeful yearning, Kierkegaard reaches for God, wondering at the Infinite and the mercy it promises.  For all these human failings, one is reminded that forgiveness is promised.  For all the distance between people and God, Kierkegaard finds hope in Christ, God reaching out for humanity as humanity blindly gropes for God.<br />This is the first book I have read by Kierkegaard, and it read quickly, though the individual passages (each of whichis a short paragraph) could each spawn individual books.  This book will inspire your own meditations and prayers.  I expecially recommend this book to Christians, though, as I said before, there is plenty for non-Christians to ponder.<br />Kierkegaard warns against those who cheat about life, &quot;copying the answer out of a book, without having worked it out for themselves.&quot;  If you copy from this book, cheater though you are, you will find new avenues to God and love.	2001-06-27

Unlike some other sci-fi future revolutions, the revolution in this book is bloodless and based solely on economics.  Borrowing ideas from modern political science and economics, Wilson visits issues like the Gold Standard, libertarianism/anarchism, inflation, totalitarianism, market controls, and even gender attitudes in old civilizations vs. frontier developments (i.e., a frontier's success is dependent on getting new people, one of the easiest ways being women giving birth -- thus, women become baby factories and are devalued with regards to any other activity or idea.)<br />However, Wilson goes a little light on all the ideology; there are some strong personalities at play in this story of an empire's accelerated downfall.  Just like in Asimov's Foundation Series, a small cabal is working to soften the impact of the inevitable crash of an overloaded empire; however, in Wilson's version, the impact is lessened by forcing a collapse in 5 years, as opposed to the expected 20.  The leader of this movement, Peter LaNague, is from an odd frontier planet Tolive (for &quot;to live&quot;), founded by a group of people following the tenets of Kyfho (in the book, Kyfho is found to be very much in the vein of Heinlein's TANSTAAFL - There Ain't No Such Thing As a Free Lunch).  But LaNague is up against the violent Droohin, leader of a rebel group whose plans were ruined by LaNague.  A mysterious ultra-violent couple under LaNague's orders keeps Droohin in check, but one wonders if the tension can hold.<br />I found the book fascinating in its development.  Wilson keeps you as well as the other conspirators in the dark as to the overarching plan - LaNague plays it close to the chest so that the movement is not betrayed.  This becomes a focal point in the interaction between LaNague and his fellow subversives, his wife, and even the government which he brings down.  <br />Wilson draws from the tradition (and has some sly nods to in the naming of some characters and spacecraft)of Frank Herbert's Dune, Robert Heinlein's Future History, Isaac Asimov's Foundation, and the detailed technical aspects of Larry Niven's work.	2001-06-24
US	52761439	R305QX8LGJH1RO	0679418601	931461181	The Deluxe Transitive Vampire: The Ultimate Handbook of Grammar for the Innocent, the Eager, and the Doomed	Books	3	24	27	N	N	A Salacious Start to Syntactical Study	A book that describes verbs as the heartthrobs of sentences can't be all bad.  With vivid imagery in grammatical examples and exhortations, one can effortlessly gobble up this book before you know it, licking your lips with verbal blood.  Gordon is =thorough=, naming grammatical entities I never knew even had names (often very suggestive names, too - expletive nouns and copulative verbs.  I suppose Mom was right - there =are= naughty words!)  However, I would suggest this as a start to investigating grammar and writing style.  Gordon's explanations are truly bare bones; for example, she simply indicates one will be chastised for splitting infinitives, but doesn't indicate =why= splitting infinitives is seen as wrong.  The reason why: 17th and 18th century grammarians decided that English grammar should be logical.  Since the most logical language they knew was formal Latin, and since one couldn't split infinitives in Latin (because they are one word in that language), they decided that one shouldn't be able to split infinitives in English, either.  However, &#34;to go boldly&#34; has a whimper of an impact compared to &#34;to boldly go&#34;.  Similarly, grammarians did away with double negatives and duplicated superlatives (native to the English language, back to the Old English) for added emphasis.  Why don't =you= tell the Rolling Stones they should've sung &#34;I Can't Get Any Satisfaction&#34;, and then you can tell Shakespeare to cut out &#34;most&#34; of &#34;the most unkindest cut of all&#34;.  However, you can't go wrong with the grammatical and stylistic rules found in Gordon's Gothic grammar; it's a great place to begin, and one is entertained in the process.  If one doesn't know how to work within those rules, one can't tell when it is legitimate to break them.  So why don't you boldly go and get satisfaction from this book?	2001-06-24
US	52761439	R21LG2PRLFWUKP	0671721399	96526141	Lanague Chronicles	Books	3	15	16	N	N	Play around in future history	In the tradition of other scifi authors who create an entire &quot;history of the future&quot;, like Larry Niven's Known Space, Herbert's Dune, Asimov's Empire and Foundation, and Heinlein's Future History, F. Paul Wilson creates a timeline one thousand years long, interweaving two main movements -- one which follows a single man, Steven Dart, and one which follows a single ideology, the LaNague Federation.<br />This book is actually the incorporation of two novels with several short stories, set in the same timeline (and presented in chronological order, similar to Heinlein's The Past Through Tomorrow).  An Enemy of the State, which you can find as a standalone novel in used book stores, tells of the bloodless, economic revolution which brought about the LaNague Federation.  Wheels Within Wheels tells of a ruthless revolt =against= the LaNague Federation, to dismantle its protection of free trade and freedom from taxes.<br />The short story series centers around Steven Dart, aka The Healer, a man who finds himself become potentially immortal through a chance encounter with an alien which takes up residence in his body with him.  He is little touched by the politics and economics of the LaNague Federation - he is interested in pursuing ideas and extending knowledge.  He finds there is something else out there which threatens humanity's existence.  A strange disease called &quot;the horrors&quot; strikes people at random, turning normal people into terrified catatonics; Steven finds that his alien symbiote can help him destroy this disease, individual by individual, but later he comes up against the source of this plague itself.  <br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book - Wilson draws you on, leaving questions open, forcing you to read further so that you can find out how things develop.  If you like the idea of building a universe and exhaustively playing around in it, this book is for you.	2001-06-24

In particular, Simon the Zealot, an apostle of Jesus left without a cause when promoters kidnap Jesus at age 23 from his particular time line, is tired of his 30 C.E. Jerusalem being held in thrall to these tourists from the future.  He and a few others of the Zealot cause are using automatic weaponry to try to eject the time travelers and the Romans (the now-puppet rulers, bought off with antibiotics, air-conditioning, and Air Jordans, it seems) in one fell swoop.<br />Oh yes, a rich-boy paleontologist trying to carry a rare dinosaur back to 2062, and a father-daughter team of grifters are accidently caught in the middle of this (while the father of the pair attempts to abscond with Wilma, the dinosaur).  Oh, and the rich boy has a bodyguard implanted in his brain which can make his body kung fu fight, when need be.<br />Had enough yet?  The whole thing is ridiculous, but it's ridiculously fun.  Though there seems to be some weighty pondering on exploitation of natives, more or less, it's never taken too totally seriously.  Those who are annoyed by sci-fi authors who use time travel as an excuse to write about their favorite historical figures - will be only minorly annoyed, perhaps.  Those who are tickled by a little Christian blasphemy will be amused, and those not overly adoring of Abraham Lincoln will snort at a particular moment in the novel.  There are no =big ideas= in here, as one might get from Heinlein, there are no =new ideas= for that matter, but there's plenty of good humor in here.  Nobody and nothing can be taken totally seriously in this book, except for Simon theZealot.  He's the only seemingly real person, with real worries, regrets, and passions, and I found his part of the story more interesting than anything else (from a serious point of view).<br />For those who complain that there are logical holes in Kessel's particular time travel premise: get over it.  You simply cannot have time travel to the past and not have logical contradictions.  You can travel to the future and not have problems (sure, you'll never get to go back where you came from, but just think -- personal jet packs!  castles in the air!  free computers for all!), you can even posit something that will let you =see= what happened in the past, but you can't travel to the past and not have absurdities popping up every place.  Kessel himself knows this, and so has funny things like a 20-something pre-Christian St. Augustine running into a middle-aged, very devout St. Augustine at a 20th century academic conference, ending with them duking it out.  Time travel is such a silly idea in sci-fi plots, and absurdity is Kessel's forte.  <br />In any case, I think it's a great book for the beach (I read it while doing the laundry) - very light, no depressing thoughts, and smirks on every page.	2001-06-20

And, being a physics major in my undergrad life, I wasn't thrown off by the veering into modern physics topics.  <br />This book is more like a travel brochure - letting you know what exciting sights are to be found in the strange lands of Geometry - but not giving you much of an experience of what's there.  I think this book would be a great gift for a child who's interested in math - sure, they won't understand alot of it (and they'll miss many of the puns), but then my favorite math book, =Godel, Escher, Bach=, was given to me when I was 12, and I grew into it over the years through rereading it and learning more stuff in school.  I can see this book as inspiring kids to learn more about strange concepts in math, but it would be nice to have a list of followup books for doing some =real= exploring as opposed to this travel guide.  (I recommend Rudy Rucker's book =The 4th Dimension= for those who want to do morethinking about the 4th dimension).<br />If you're a math teacher, this book can come in handy in providing was to visualize some very odd concepts in math.  And, again, there's the puns that you can try out on your class.  <br />For those interested in getting a feel for what math is about, there's actually a great secret revealed inside the book - just what makes something a geometry.  The answer doesn't seem evident when one compares the odd spaces and places visited by Victoria Line and the Spacehopper, but it does become clear.  I will not give that secret away, but I will give another secret away that is also shown by the book - yes, mathematicians love to play with their math.	2001-06-18

What do I mean almost, =all= of them are autobiographical.  This book follows David from his childhood in Raleigh, to Chicago &amp; New York (&amp;somewhere else I can't remember, all I know is it involved hitchhiking), and then finally his escape to France, where he finds three French teens lying in the road in front of his house, supposedly waiting for Madonna to drop by to visit him (ha.)  <br />Many of these essays have been published in magazines like Esquire, and some form of most of these have also been heard on the public radio show &quot;This American Life&quot;.

There are a few interesting ideas in this collection of loosely-connected short stories, in which America has been destroyed by nuclear bombs from Russia, and biochemical warfare (new, more virulent strains of diseases such as syphillus have been let loose), and in particular, the Mormons in Utah have recreated society, scavenging off the old and reclaiming the desert for farmland.  The Great Salt Lake area has been flooded, and the great Mormon Temple is submerged.<br />However, for all this interesting background, Card doesn't so much concentrate on the details of how this has all worked - he throws in details as the stories need them, giving one a little more of an idea as to what's up.  <br />Instead, as is Card's wont, the center of the stories are people, families, and communities - how a perpetual outsider or loner gets himself accepted in a group, how members of a group bolster and undercut one another, how civilization gets built on the backs of people who feel hemmed in.  The last story, America, doesn't quite fit with the others in this theme - it's more visionary, and more about 1-on-1 relationships as opposed to group dynamics.  <br />Still, Card has written much better short stories than these, in treating character, dynamics, and the like.  He has also touched on Mormon themes, history, and scripture in his Homecoming and Alvin Maker series, and now that I've been primed for it, I can find it all over the place in his writings.  However, Mormonism and post-apocalyptic science fiction are an interesting mix, so if you've exhausted your other avenues to Card, this isn't time wasted.  It's just that he's written so many better books.	2001-06-13

It covers a short history of official American manners, such as when President Thomas Jefferson tried to apply his democratic ideals by calling all foreign envoys &quot;Mr. Stuart&quot; and the like, as opposed to using titles in official protocol.  This idea did not last.<br />However, there really isn't that much substance in this book that has not been covered in one of Ms. Martin's many other books.  Her main idea is that, as a democratic society, social manners should not depend on money or rank, but egalitarianism, where the fair way to decide precedence is by age -- simply for the reason that everyone eventually gets their chance to take precedence, should they live long enough.  Still, reading this prompted me to write Ms. Martin to ask her to write a more complete book on the history of American etiquette.  I still await that book.<br />I would recommend buying a different book by Ms. Martin; the wait I had to get this book wasn't worth it.	2001-06-13

Highly accessible, requiring some algebra, but not much more, the book introduces the deceptively simple mathematical subject of game theory.  First of all, it indicates what is =meant= by a game -- something more akin to rock, paper, scissors, than monopoly or chess.  Game theory (in a way like chaos theory) is seriously mis-named; the games played tend to be ones that are simple models of economic choice or political strategizing.  This is why research in game theory has led to the Nobel Prize in Economics for more than one person.<br />In any case, I used this book as a resource in a discrete math class for teenaged students who were extremely interested in math.  It was intended for non-math majors in college, but I think it would work very well as enrichment in the high school classroom (or even middle school -- one can use it in developing an application for algebra).  After learning the rudiments of game theory, I thought to apply the concept to =The Weakest Link=, and found that, as a game, it is far more complicated than what you'll find in this book.<br />Still, this is just a starting point.  There are plenty of avenues to explore beyond what is covered in here, but one can get bogged down with all the different types of situations that have been treated in game theory.	2001-06-05

In this book, Mero adds some flesh to game theory, explaining why so many people become entranced with how it sets up economic and social choices as toy puzzles, in which people are trying to get the best possible outcome.  <br />In particular, he explains some of the more infamous non-zero-sum games: the dollar auction, in which a dollar bill is auctioned off, but with a twist - both the highest bidder and the second-highest bidder must pay their bids, but only the highest bidder gets the dollar; and the prisoner's dilemma (and its variants), in which cooperation is the best result for the 2 players combined, but there's the danger of being undermined by the other player and individually losing everything.  The dollar auction is likened to an arms race (indeed, the U.S. won =that= particular dollar auction against the Soviets), where what is being bought is military supremacy between superpowers.  The prisoner's dilemma can be likened to a situation like a lane closure on a busy highway: if one merges in turn, and everybody else does, traffic keeps flowing somewhat; however, if only one person zooms ahead and merges ahead of where they should in fairness, the traffic can still go on fine and that one zoomer gets a benefit over the other drivers.  But if =everybody= tries to cut in line... traffic clog.  <br />It is true that trying to extend game theory to morality is a tricky business, and as another reviewer has put it, the book gets downright embarrassing towards the end.  However, I am a math teacher, and have used ideas from the book to put more =oomph= in my classes on game theory to gifted teenagers.  There isn't much in the way of math in here, but plenty of rational thinking and can lead a little light on to why game theory research has led to the winning of a Nobel Prize in Economics (or two).	2001-06-05

Down to the very molecules.  There's a good touch of amateur science as well, when he attempts to see how much oil an egg yolk can =really= emulsify (the answer was amazing!) and how one can use butter to emulsify itself!  This book has inspired me with its easy-to-understand analyses of chemical and physical processes to do some food experimenting of my own - my husband is a vegetarian, so I can't use the direct knowledge of how butter and eggs work.  But McGee =does= indicate which substances in the foods do the work, and I can find vegetable replacements for that.<br />Also of deep interest is the question &quot;Why does food taste better cooked?&quot;  in which one discovers that &quot;All food aspires to the condition of fruit.&quot;  The topic selection is somewhat hodge-podge, but one comes away with a greater appreciation for the complexity of cooking (and not as impressed with beurre blanc sauces - it's almost impossible to screw those up!)  <br />And for those who like this book, I recommend the T.V. show &quot;Good Eats&quot;, hosted by Alton Brown, on the Food Network, which draws on a similar scientific interest in all things eaten.	2001-05-25

Meet the author who far surpasses him in making flesh creep and cringe, in this book more than most.  In Barnaby Rudge, Dickens portrays the Gordon Riots, a violent anti-Catholic outburst in London in 1780, supposedly started by the opposition by Lord Gordon to some acts in Parliament which would've relieved some of the burdens of Catholic citizens: the right to directly inherit property and the right to educate their children in  England.  As usual, Dickens ignores the political pressures, likely brought about   by the French allying themselves with the Americans in their colonial war, which would've stirred up suspicions of Anglo-Catholics being in league with the French.<br />In any case, I can see why this book has never matched the popularity of &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;, as there is no possibility for heroes in scenes of mob violence.  Even those who refuse to cooperate with the rioters can do little more than resist. Locksmith Gabriel Varden, being forcibly brought to Newgate prison,  refuses to pick the lock for the masses of rowdy men intending to free their comrades and anyone else locked inside; however, his resistence means little as the mob decides to burn down the door instead.  Mr. Haredale is often defiant, but he can do little more than beat a retreat when faced by hundreds of belligerent men.  None of this &quot;'Tis a far, far better thing...&quot; kind of statement which can be made.<br />Ignore the plot lines.  They are cursory, even for Dickens.  They are there merely to set up the characters and their own personal motivations so one can see what happens to them when all order dissolves.  I could see whythe English of Dickens'  day may have not wanted to read this book -- it was far too scary, especially as Dickens portraying the fuel to the rioters' fire being the primal urges to destruction and looting.  Though there was then (in 1841) a better policing force and better prisons, there still was the unbearable poverty and dissipation alive in London.  Then, as now, there were plenty ripe to take advantage of any opportunity to set fire to the town.  Think the actions in here too far-fetched for even these times?  Consider the fires, destruction, and looting that start in any modern city, once rioters have been given an opening.<br />People are crushed underfoot, men are consumed by the very fires they had set, and decent people stand by because they are powerless in the face of the massive wave of violence.  Dickens shirks not one detail.  If you're thinking of a quaint  Victorian period piece, for crying out loud, don't read this book!  Go read Pickwick Papers or Old Curiosity Shop.  However, if you enjoy this kind of disaster, by all means, read Barnaby Rudge (or might I suggest Hard Times, which    has some pretty horrific deaths).	2001-02-06

Books	5	11	13	N	N	the disgusting old days is more like it	This book is absolutely harrowing and makes one wonder how America lasted until the 20th century -- learn the 19th century origins of the U.S. drug problem (children got hooked on the morphine and the opium in the patent medicines given to them to calm them down, for example) and why the Prohibition might not actually have been an over-reaction to alcohol; learn how our public school system originated as a rote memorization factory in which children ill-fed, ill-taught, and ill-washed crammed onto benches while an ignorant man or woman, not paid enough for even room and board, tried to keep some semblance of order (for which endeavor one schoolteacher got stoned to death for her pains); learn how common were the transportation accidents of the day, in which railroad tracks went through towns without regard to the usual traffic and a propensity for cutting the maintenance costs meant dangerous conditions for those on and off the train.<br />This book does not go into exhaustive detail (even if it exhausts the reader), and is illustrated with clippings from magazines and newspapers of the time.  One other reviewer complained that photographs weren't used, but truthfully I don't =want= to see the photographs of the conditions.  The drawings and the text provide enough horror, and I think Dr. Bettman did not want to put readers off =too= much.  Also, the drawings from the press give one information that photographs would not have -- the perspective of the people at the time.  Many of the drawings come with captions or some doggerel poetry, indicating how well people knew what disgusting things they were getting into.	2001-01-22
US	52761439	R2X5GYXQPSSAAB	0312876513	882430933	Shadow of the Hegemon (The Shadow Series)	Books	4	4	6	N	N	Bean's coming into humanity	You know what, I just want a mini-tirade to begin:  Orson Scott Card's novels shouldn't be shelved in a sci-fi/fantasy ghetto -- in fact, I don't believe there should be such genre Balkanization at all.  Card's presence has improved character development and storytelling in sci-fi/fantasy, but I think American fiction on the whole could use that help.<br />Now to the real review:<br />This novel is the perfect follow-up to Ender's Shadow, showing the further development of Bean's character and his coming into humanity -- he is still the calculating machine of the earlier novel, but he now allows himself to have genuine human attachments, not just the calculated relationships of Rotterdam and Battle School.  <br />However, to have the full emotional impact, one must read the first novel first (people may find this to be a truism in a novel series, but there have been several series that I have managed to read not only out of order but in reverse order without losing what is necessary to follow the action or characters).  In many ways, Card is an adept at playing on emotions - as Petra notes at one point, one can know an author is deliberately setting you up for a particular emotional response in a very blatant way, and still not be able to prevent that response.  I was in tears twice during this novel, even knowing what was looming ahead.  <br />Orson Scott Card admits that his original idea for this book ended up getting split into two novels, and perhaps I would have been impatient had he decided to fuse what will now be two novels into one really long one (not impatient because I can't handle the length - my favorite books are all over 700 pages long - but because he would've published later).  But I think I could have withstood the wait!  I hate it when he finishes his novels in the middle.  The post-Ender's Game trilogy irritated me in that very way.  I understand that he does better than many authors in staying true to reality, and in that way one can't expectall ties to be neatly gathered at the end, but for crying out loud this is fiction, and I need more resolution than Peter getting to be Hegemon at the end! (I'm not giving anything away plot-wise really because: 1) Orson Scott Card's novels are almost never about plot but about character development 2) Anyone who has read the Ender's Game books know that Peter ends as Hegemon eventually anyway.)<br />Card has been very smart in these books, Ender's Shadow and Shadow of the Hegemon, for he always leaves a big hole for one to peer into and wonder:  What is happening in there?  People may have seen Achilles' escape at the end of Ender's Shadow as an obvious ploy to a sequel (which it was), but I found the disclosure of Bean's probable future physical development to be even more intriguing -- how long does Bean have to live?  What will he accomplish before he dies?  This question remains open at the end of Shadow of the Hegemon, and one knows this will hang until the 4th book - or 5th if Card ends up splitting up another novel.<br />For the sake of the reader, Card, please don't split another novel!  Just make an extra-long one!  If kids can handle a 700 page Harry Potter book, Card fans can handle an 800-page Bean book!  Argh!	2001-01-21
US	52761439	R2IHQQLEY80CE3	1570089949	632116943	Sarah: Women of Genesis	Books	5	16	17	N	N	a tradition of strong women, and strong marriages	Unlike what one other reviewer has written here, I believe this book is very much in keeping with almost all other novels Card has written: characters of strength and integrity committed to some grand cause, sometimes misunderstanding each other, coming to equality in relationships by the end.  Of course, a little politicking/social maneuvering is thrown in as well, as well as historicity of customs and action (oooh, how racy =were= those Egyptians, anyway?  One wonders if today's fashions of tight Tshirts and bun-hugging jeans, though not as translucent as the Egyptian linens, would have been found objectionable by the modest desert nomads?)<br />While Card adds details not found in the original Biblical source (and he also admits to adding some details that are not found in the Old Testament, but are in Mormon scripture), he also edits the story to sew up some plot holes - not unreasonable, considering, as with many of the Genesis stories, there is more than one source (checking my Bible, it mentions that both the Eloist and Yahwist sources both contribute (so named because of their words for God - either Eloi or Yahweh)).  One sees the repitition of the device of the man claiming his wife to be his sister in the Bible - not only twice in the case of Abraham and Sarah, but also in Isaac's story.   Many of these plot changes may irritate a Biblical fundamentalist, but they are not too glaring.  I had to go back to the Bible to figure out what was changed -- the story pretty much agreed with the tale I remember hearing as a child.<br />However, the best part of this book was Sarah herself.  Like most women in Card's fiction, she gets to be a strong person in her own right - not pretending to be less intelligent or skilled than she is, not bowing under men's authority or words simply because they are men.  People might complain about the less attractive female characters Qira and Hagar, but he also gives these women autonomous characters.  They do not blend into thebackground, but are shown as captains of their own souls, even if they turn out to have made poor choices.<br />Most importantly with Sarah, Card shows how a person of faith lives when they do not get to hear God's voice directly.  Abraham gets to hear God speak, so he is sure in knowing that he shall be the ancestor of a great people, he is sure that he shall win military conflict, he is sure of eventual success.  Sarah must hear the words of God through others, and in a world that offers many gods, she doubts and is hurt by the conflict between her doubt and her faith.  I see this book as being popular among people of faith, whatever their religions, for it mirrors some of their own conflicts (If there is a benevolent God, why is there so much suffering?  Am I being punished by God for something?) in their souls.	2001-01-21

I find it the most two-dimensional of all his novels (and I've read the Old Curiousity Shop, which is full of grotesqueries!).  But I do want to provide some perspective as to the background of this novel.<br />Before Dickens wrote this novel, some friends of his brought to his notice of horrid boarding schools in the Yorkshire area.  Dickens traveled the countryside incognito, visiting the schools and some people in the area.  He found that these schools were being run under the principle of being storehouses for unwanted boys.  &quot;Natural&quot; children, inconvenient children from a first marriage, children of widowers who didn't have time to bring up their boys were shipped off to these schools, never to come home for the holidays, and under most circumstances the boy wouldn't make it to the age of 18 at which time he would be ejected from the school with no useful learning.<br />Part of the motivation of this novel was to bring this practice to light -- many of the people in Yorkshire did not know what was going on the schools and those who did know did not see what they could do about it.<br />Then Nicholas Nickleby started to be published.  Like all of his novels, this book came out in 3-chapter installments.  Well before the book was halfway over, people spontaneously gathered around some of these schools, ejected children and masters alike, and set the buildings to torch.  By the end of publication, the infamous Yorkshire schools were totally gone.<br />So keep this in mind while reading this book, which seems juvenile and flat compared even his previous two novels, Oliver Twist and Nicholas Nickleby.  This is the only of Dickens' novels to have an immediate and profound impact in his society.  When was the last time you heard of a novel creating effective activism in a community?	2000-09-29

Of course, such a mental and social revolution is unlikely to occur; even so, she would hold onto her job due to the fitting, cutting remarks sent to those who are not operating under those two principles alone.  There would still be enough stupid, petty people to fuel fher column.<br />If one hasn't read a Miss Manners column or book before, this slim volume is the perfect introduction -- it's all about eating, something most people get a chance to deal with every day.  She answers questions regarding how to eat specific food items properly, who should be paying for a meal at a restaurant (clue: it's the one who said &quot;I'll be taking you out to dinner&quot;), and even touching upon the dreaded fork issue.  I'll give that one away, too: you work from the outside in.<br />Even if you know all the proper behavior for mealtimes, Miss Manners holds one's interest by bringing up intriguing etiquette history facts - such as the handbook of etiquette rules that a teenaged George Washington wrote containing such tidbits as the fact one should not use silverware or table linens to clean one's teeth at table.  And, of course, those who fight on the side of etiquette in all realms (such as family meals) find themselves bolstered by Miss Manners unanswerable arguments.<br />Even if you have read many of her books before, I would still get it, for it is the perfect size for reading on the subway or the occaisional lunch alone (never read while eating with someone else... except at breakfast time).  It reads quickly, and one can skip around topic by topic.	2000-09-29

Read this book to understand the hypocrisy of Pecksniff and Mrs. Prigg's interesting friend, Mrs. Harris.  These two things pop up as literary references all over the place.  Now I finally understand the &quot;Harris&quot; reference in Murder on the Orient Express!<br />There are all sorts of deceptions and selfishness going on in this book, but by far, Seth Pecksniff is the most perfect character to be found of all Dickens' comic characters.  There is a darkness in the profile of Mr. Pecksniff, but he is made to ridiculed, and Dickens does not let a chance pass to ridicule Pecksniff.<br />I want to digress a moment, for Dickens did as well -- there is a section where young Martin Chuzzlewit tries his fortune in America.  And there is quite a bit of anti-American sentiment to be found in these parts (a fact which caused emnity between Dickens and the American public until he made his 2nd and final tour in 1870 or so).  There are two reasons for this: first, Martin Chuzzlewit simply did not have the sales figures of previous novels.  Anti-American books seemed to be &quot;the thing&quot; (just like diet books are popular today) in Britain, so he went for that.  Secondly, Dickens had just been on a rather contentious tour of the U.S. in which he had been trying to make a case for international copyright.  You see, the U.S. was the China of that day -- infamous for pirating works of people from other countries.  Publishers in America had been printing their own copies of Dickens novels at cut rates (because they weren't paying Dickens or his British publishers anything!)  When Dickens tried to make his plea for intellectual property rights, these same publishers of newspapers did a hatchet job of Mr. Dickens' reputation.  So, basically, Dickens had an axe to grind.<br />In any case, feel free to skip all the Chuzzlewit in America bits.  There is a moment of self-realization for young Martin, but it's not essential.  All the essential action is going on in England, and Martin will return to finish business.  There's also a pyramid scheme-like scam going on as part of a subplot, so now we've got two things involved in this novel that people think are debates of modern origin: intellectual property rights and bad financial info.  Just remember, Napster and Internet stock tips are only the latest manifestation of old themes; at the very least, this book will remind you of that.	2000-09-29

I don't know when honesty seemed to have become the principal virtue of life -- many people seem to think that the &quot;honest&quot; bit of &quot;brutally honest&quot; outweighs the &quot;brutal&quot; part.<br />Guess what.  It doesn't.  And Miss Manners tells you why.<br />This slim volume would probably not stop the tactless person from informing a young, grieving widow, at her husband's funeral, that her mother-in-law must feel this more deeply than her, for the death of a child is worse than the death of a spouse.  Any person who thought for a moment would realize this is an extremely thoughtless thing to say.  However, this may come in handy for the parent who is trying to come up with arguments for =why= their teenagers shouldn't say certain things.  And it's definitely helpful for the people who are trying to be polite in the face of unbelievable rudeness (like the event I mentioned above.)<br />Miss Manners can be extremely cutting to those who deserve it -- those so self-centered that they care not what effects their words will have on others.	2000-09-29

Sure, this is a science fiction story of the end of the world, a genre I generally detest (but not as much as I detest =post=-apocalyptic novels) - but I couldn't resist.  This novel is set in the two places I know best -- New York City and Raleigh, North Carolina.  New York is more of an amorphous mass to deal with, location-wise, but Kessel gets Raleigh spot-on.<br />The camp awaiting Armageddon on Fayetteville Street Mall brings back memories of days when I was a student at North Carolina State University, strolling through the Brickyard, being yelled at by Rev. Birdsong, one of the many brickyard preachers.  You see, it was immoral for me, lustful temptress, to wear shorts around such impressionable young men.  Let's ignore for the moment that my shorts stopped at my knees.  I found it amusing to think of a fire-and-brimstone preacher denouncing the godless people on Hillsborough, given that of all the UNC system schools, NCSU must be the most conservative (it is, after all, an engineering and agriculture school).<br />But I digress.<br />This is somewhat of a comic novel, and the characters really aren't fully-fleshed human beings.  But this is a very fun read -- a very strange virus, a confusion (for me, at least) of identity, and some good news from... well, you know the title.  Even if you're not from Raleigh, you'll have fun reading this book.	2000-09-29

And the poems in this book are sincerely bad.  Much of it is bad in a high-school-lit-mag kind of bad; I've edited a high school lit mag.  It can get much worse than this.<br />However, I cannot give it a full five stars, because it overlooks some truly execrable work from hideous poets.  I mean, William McGonagall, worst of bad Scottish poets (Robbie Burns can erase only so much of that stain), wrote the immortal lines:<br />And when Life's prospects may at times appear dreary to ye, Remember Alois Senefelder, the discoverer of lithography.<br />The examples of his poetry in here are actually =better= than many I've seen elsewhere.  His poem on allowing women the vote was something to be seen to be believed.   So I think they could've picked poems even more amusing than the ones in there.  The same goes for Julia Moore.  <br />Also, I felt that some of the poetry picked was not truly horrible.  There should be no question of the badness of the poetry, but some of the poems I came away thinking &quot;I've seen much worse&quot;, or lines were taken out of context.<br />However, most of the poetry is extremely bad and extremely funny.  It should be given to any aspiring poet as a warning.  This book was published in 1971, and I believe the last 30 years has generated plenty of very sincere, very bad poetry which should be enough to fill another volume.  Anyone care to edit a new book?	2000-09-29

You see, I had been brought up on soap operas - I knew the common, unbelievable developments in such a plot.<br />I did not understand the point of a Dickens novel at the tender, unexperienced age of 13.<br />Many people nowadays may be daunted by the size of such a novel (the Dickens novels taught at schools - A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist, David Copperfield, Great Expectations - are of his =shortest= novels), but a reader will be well-rewarded for embarking on this one.  It opens with a father and daughter in a rowboat, dragging back a body found in the river.  The murdered man was heir to a fortune made through London's garbage, and Bella, a woman in town of modest means was to have been his wife by the will of the murdered man's father.  Instead, the fortune of the ash heaps go to the Boffins, who had been employees of the old man.  Shall they be spoiled by the instant wealth?  Is there another will to be found among the ash heaps?  Who is the mysterious, backgroundless man who becomes Mr. Boffin's secretary and watches over Bella?  What of the daughter of the riverman, who is pursued by an idle lawyer and her brother's brooding schoolmaster?<br />Dickens was at the top of his craft in weaving plots and characters together in this novel.  He throws some bones to readers every so often, answering some mysteries while opening some others.  The recent production on Masterpiece Theater follows the story well, but, as is usual, many of the side characters have been dropped, and the development of some of the characters is rather sketchy.  Don't stand for diluted Dickens!  The man was master of the novel, and this should be one of the first of his to read.	2000-09-29

However, the completion made, though somewhat livelier than I am used to from Austen, fits in quite well with the start that had been  made.<br />The plot is extremely light compared to Austen's other books --  there are indeed, some very annoying characters, but what ill-spirited  characters there are give no real distress to the heroine of the book, as  is usual in the other books.  Many of the &quot;comic&quot; characters are  allowed to show some improvement (which is odd compared to such Austen  creations as Mrs. Bennett, or Robert Ferrars), but who knows?  The 11  chapters written by Austen seemed written in a very light spirit, and  perhaps something like this novel would have been the result.<br />I think it  a very good read.	1999-12-03
