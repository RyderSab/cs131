First off, I must say that I have always respected the writing of Bob Woodward.  His adeptness at investigative journalism is wonderful.  Here, we see the sides of George Bush which weren't made public during the three months following the horrendous attack.  Personally, I am pleased to see this side of the administration.<br />The inside look at the meetings serves to enlighten the reader that such meetings are not taken lightly, nor is the information provided therein.  Boring?  To some perhaps.  But the key objective is not to see what is said, but to &quot;feel&quot; it instead.  As with all humans, more often than not, the most important words are the ones said not with the lips, but with the rest of the body.  Bob Woodward takes the reader into these meetings and presents them in a way that doesn't necessarily allow you to feel you are there - that is for the fiction writer.  Instead, he focuses on the events unfolding and how the decisions were made.<br />All-in-all, I have to tip my hat once again at Mr. Woodward.  His saavy for getting a story has not diminished, and his ability to translate the twisting jargon from inside the beltway and corridors of government into something that even laymen can understand, makes this a wonderful book which will allow the reader to really understand the decision-making process that goes on where the rest of the public never gets to see.	2002-12-21

I wanted to voice my opinion on this, but I don't wish to bore anyone with a long, drawn-out dialogue on a subject that many others have already given credit to.  Therefore, I shall merely point out that novels that have a longevity beyond a single generation as a respected and prolific work are simply in a league of their own.  This work rises to the top of that small selection, and is the standard by which ALL writing is set.	2001-12-19

Once again, Stephen Ambrose has gone to great lengths to bring a piece of history to his readers.<br />In &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;, Ambrose carefully re-constructs the war from the viewpoint of the soldiers who were there, to include their horrors, fears, and thrills.  By searching for, and locating, survivors from this unit and getting their personal accounts of the events, Mr. Ambrose has come through with a work that literally puts you in the middle of the action.<br />I tip my hat to Mr. Ambrose, his work, and the honor that he gives the men who served.  I tip this not only as an author, but also as one who served many years in the uniform.	2001-12-19

Bernard Goldberg has finally expressed, in a professional and knowledgeable way, what America has known for decades: that news reporting is biased and never tells the whole story.<br />Many of us (myself included) sit and watch the evening news with a deaf ear these days.  This is because we have grown weary of listening to the same old dialogue that rambles from the speakers every night.  We hear about one thing or another, see clips from this place and that, but they all report only one side of the entire picture.  In fact, over the years, watching the news has become similar to looking at the family picture with the color removed.  There's no broad spectrum, no honest dialogue, no fairness.  What we have been left with is the black-and-white discussions of &quot;this is right&quot; and &quot;we can't talk about that&quot;.  Unfortunately, the only ones who suffer from this are the American people.<br />There is an old saying: &quot;The story of a 12 year-old who kills his mother will be on page one, or will be the lead television news story.  However, let a 12 year-old risk his life to save two or three younger kids; or one of his parents, and the story gets buried somewhere in the back of the newspaper; or a quick mention at the end of the broadcast followed by a very quick &quot;good-night&quot;.  That is, if it even gets a mention at all, which is most often the case.  This is sad because not only does it fail to mention a newsworthy item, but it gives no incentive for our youth of today to DO good deeds and such.  If a child sees all of the news stories covering violence and death, then they will come to understand that committing acts of this nature are the only way to gain attention.  That attitude is far worse than any violence or language on television or elsewhere.<br />&quot;Bias&quot; finally explains some of the reasons why this happens.  It should also serve as a rallying cry for people to stand up to the Fourth Estate and tell them that the time hascome for honest and fair reporting.<br />I salute Mr. Goldberg for his candor on this subject, and for his diligence in bringing the truth to the attention of all.	2001-12-19

Stephan Ambrose has written  something that verges upon legend.  His accounting of the B-24, and George McGovern's time while assigned to the 455th is really a study in history.  It also shows the tenacity with which he strives to include every detail.<br />The B-24 is the &quot;lost sheep&quot; of airpower in WWII.  Everyone seems to be fascinated with the B-17, primarily because of the press it received.  Also at the top of the list is the B-29, primarily because of the atomic bombs.  However, the role that was played by the B-24 was, in fact, much larger, and amassed more scope.  It just had the poor luck not to be identified as an icon.<br />One of the most important air raids in WWII was the raids on the Ploesti oilfields.  B-24's handled this raid brilliantly.  However, as history would have it, this one small fact has often been overlooked.  Ask a handful of people today which bomber was used in this raid, and a large majority will not be able to tell you.<br />In his telling of the B-24, Stephan Ambrose has gone all-out.  His descriptive tone of narration is exquisite, making you feel that you are actually in every inch of the aircraft.  His in-depth look at the more famous raids puts you right there with the crew . . . so much that you can almost feel the shock wave from the flak, and hear the sounds of the cannon rounds as they whiz by.<br />All-in-all, this book is one for the ages.  Finally, as the Tuskeegee Airmen book (and movie) did for those brave flyers, this book has finally given credit where it has been long overdue.  The B-24 was aptly named &quot;The Liberator&quot;, and it truly lived up to its name - liberating Europe and the world.	2001-08-18

I picked up this book for two reasons: One, because Faye is a fellow PublishAmerica Author.  The second is that I am VERY familiar with the trials and tribulations that someone goes through when a loved one is suffering from clinical depression.<br />The horrific thing about depression and other mental illnesses is the refusal to talk about it.  Depression is one of the leading causes of suicide, unemployment, and hospitalization in this country.  Yet, people still want to turn a blind eye when it is mentioned.  Too often, a person with a depression, or similar mental illness, is told to &quot;snap out of it&quot;, or something like that.  What a majority of the nation (sadly, over 85% or more) don't understand is that it is a disease, just like any other that threatens our society.  The worst part is that there has been such a stigma attached to mental illness, that fully 75% of people who are suffering from it will not seek help for fear of being branded a &quot;kook&quot;.<br />I applaud Faye's diligence in writing about this horrid disease and its effects.  I have had dealings with someone who is clinincally depressed, and someone with bipolar disorder.  Neither are fun to deal with, especially when they are loved ones.  My congratulations go out to Faye for her work, and my sympathies for having to deal with this horrid &quot;beast&quot;.	2001-08-11

In not even getting the ideology of the actual statement correct, Mr. Wilkinson has shown, once again, that religion will continually take what doesn't fit, and turn it into something that &quot;will work&quot; in order to try and convert people to their views.<br />This book has all of the trappings of a history tale, if one looks at the surrounding facts.  Many centuries ago, Christians stole stories from the ancient Celts and Druids, reworded them, and then claimed that they were their own, passed down from history.  Mr. Wilkinson is doing something very similar here, taking a prayer of self-centeredness and self-worth, twisting it just enough out of context, and presenting it as a prayer of sacrifice and honor.<br />Josef Goebbels once stated that &quot;Good propoganda is 80% fact, mixed with 20% fiction.&quot;  I am afraid that theat moniker holds true here.  While the prayer did exist, and the man's name was Jabez, and he did live during that time period, the basics of the prayer itself have been converted to serve a purpose opposite of what it was intended.  A sad example of religious teaching and doctrine.	2001-08-05

The result is a work that exemplifies the term &quot;researh&quot;, and provides what could be called the greatest look at a man who is largely unknown.<br />John Adams' presidency is often overshadowed by the events of the time.  Most people don't realize the impact that he made while he served as the leader of the fledging nation that would evolve into the most prominent nation in the world.  McCullough delves into the man, without really taking away from the myth, going into various details that have been sorrowfully left out of other writings.<br />This book has an appeal to me as a personal student of history, as well as an author of my own accord.  Mr. McCullough has exemplified the methods by which historical information is presented, and delivers his work in a manner that is enjoyable for all, regardless of their degree of interest in the period.<br />As the author of Strike Hard, I would firmly recommend this book to anyone who would like to have a better understanding of what John Adams was like, what he went through, and where his true philosophies came from.  The result is amazing, shocking, and altogether a wonderful experience that is one not to be missed.	2001-08-05

At least 25% will not even be able to tell you in what war it took place.  The sad price of ignorance, as the opening line of this review states, is repetition.<br />Hampton Sides has taken a part of history and brought it back to the forefront.  The story of what these people went through, and the missions undertaken for them, are stories of heroism at its best.  Forget the stories of bravery in combat, or the daring air raids.  The Ghost Soldiers suffered through agony and torture at the hands of an enemy - agony and torture that were uncalled for and appalling by any standards of humanity.<br />For wht it's worth, I beg everyone to read this book with your children.  Pass on the story of what happened to these brave men so that it shall not be forgotten . . . lest it be allowed to happen again.	2001-08-05

Books	3	6	20	N	N	One thing to read - Another to follow.	There are a number of points in this book that are interesting, but a major aspect is overlooked.  The fact that a number of Americans simply don't have the luxury of following the hints and advice that are contained in here.<br />A large percentage of America is comprised of people who are barely making ends meet.  These people don't have the ability to put money away, in any form, for a chance to make it big.  The reasons are numerous, but the biggest problem is that they aren't afforded the chance to advance or get into something that would allow it.<br />Take, for example, the veteran.  Here is a person who has accumulated a vast amount of experience in a career path - let's say management.  A veteran with 7 years personnel management in the army is not considered management material by very many places at all.  And, if this person never had the time or opportunity to obtain a degree, they are stuck in a rut that will not allow them a way out.  They apply for positions which they should be qualified for, because of their experience, only to be told that they don't have the proper education.  When they try for a lower position that doesn't require the education, they are told that they're overqualified.<br />As I said, there are a number of valid points presented in this book.  However, they are points which can only be used by a small percentage of people who can afford the opportunity to take advantage of them, and not the vast numbers who need the chance to get ahead.	2001-08-05

Truddi Chase has taken a chance (one that has paid off well) in her book &quot;When Rabbit Howls&quot;.  I personally have to tip my hat to her for examining a traumatical experience that is still kept (sorrowfully) in the back of mainstream society today.<br />Sad as it may be, too many people still misunderstand Multiple-Personality-Disorder (MPD).  It is quite probably the least understood of all of the afflictions that are grouped under the banner of &quot;Depression&quot;.  Anyone who would stop for a minute and actually look into the number of Depression cases, and MPD in particular, would be shocked to learn the numbers that are medical fact.<br />Truddi Chase takes the reader along a roller-coaster ride that examines the creation and development of MPD.  While there are as many different methods and reasons as to why this happens as there are people afflicted, Truddi examines this in such exquisite detail that is so realistic that it actually holds some fright for the reader.  Fright in the manner of thoroughly explaining what goes on in the mind of someone suffering from this, and how it develops from something that too many people believe are events that aren't so terrible.<br />Mental illness in any form is a tragic thing for anyone to go through.  At times, it is hard to determine on whom it is worse - the person suffering, or the person living and dealing with the sufferer.  The best way to cope with either situation is to understand the affliction, and this is precisely what Truddi does here.  She presents it in a manner that can be understood and appreciated.  This is one book that I would recommend everyone read at least once so that at least some basic understanding of this disease can be made, without any of the conclusions that many (unfortunately so) reach when this subject is brought to bear.	2001-08-05

P>Bill Sammon has written a powerful book that gazes into the sometimes corrupt world of the electoral process, and how one man can have a determination so badly that he will even attempt to bend the constitutional provisions by which the process is set forth.  In reading this, I would have to agree with my fellow author and reviewer E.L. Burton in saying that this book read more like a fiction novel than fact.  In that, I mean to say that fiction novels have a sense about them that make them unrealistic in some ways.  The events that Bill Sammon wrote about were shocking, and it was almost inconceivable that such a thing could happen in our society.  But happen it did, and I implore everyone to make sure that our children read this as well as us.  For if they don't take notice of how the system can be manipulated and rights transgressed by those in power, then our nation is surely doomed to suffer this fate once again.	2001-08-05

For years, America has lived with the tale of the four basic food groups.  Then, a number of years back, this was changed to the &quot;nutritional pyramid&quot;.  Now, the Harvard Medical school wants to flex its academic muscle and change this yet again.<br />So many times, people come out with new and improved (?) ways of dieting and nutrition.  Most times, however, these methods are leaped upon by an unsuspecting society and hailed as the new &quot;wonder methods&quot; that will make us a healthier people.  However, each time there appears new evidence that totally dismantles those theories.  Back in the 70's, saccharine was deemed the devil's mixture because of the threat of cancer.  So, nutrisweet was born.  Then, nutrisweet was a cancer-causing agent.  In the early 80's, cholesterol in eggs was a harbinger of death.  Then, it was reported that the numbers were inflated, thus resulting in that information not being any good.<br />Now, Harvard Medical is trying to say that following a balanced diet is not the healthy way to go.  It makes a person start to wonder whn theyare going to come out with the notion that chips, dip, and ice cream are the healthiest things a person can eat.	2001-08-05

Katherine Graham will always leave a legacy that will be an indelible mark upon the publishing/writing world.  Her dedication and perserverence in making the Washington Post and its enterprises into what they are today is a testimonial to the willpower and dtermination of this wonderful woman who shall be sorely missed in the literary and journalism world.<br />Katherine Graham was thrust upon the scene in a time when the United States was in the process of undergoing one of the worst upheavels in our history.  Fate would have it that two reporters on her staff would make the key discoveries that would lead to the downfall of a president.  However, what is often overlooked in that story is that while the threat of collapse was upon her, Katherine Graham stood by her staff and doggedly pushed them on, even when faced with the downfall of her growing enterprise, should the story have been not what it seemed.  This was typical Katherine Graham.  A woman who knew what she wanted out of her life and strode to get it.<br />The life of this great woman should be viewed as an example of perserverence.  Most times remarks like that are made about ficticious characters.  True, as the author of Strike Hard I found that when creating fictional characters, we all have a sense of success and achievement.  However, this story is not fiction, yet shines as a beacon to any and all who have a dream, desire, or goal in their life.  Katherine Graham had a determination to make something out of her life and out of the Post, and she did both with elegance, pride, and an unwaiverable determination that allowed her success.	2001-08-05

Ok, let's get some facts straight here....<br />First: Change is good.  Actually, that depends on the person and the type of change.  If you are unhappy with your job, does that mean that quitting and changing is a good thing?  NO!  In today's society, it is not easy to change jobs, let alone vocations.  In most instances, that job is the one thing that is sustaining a family, and giving it up for the sake of change could result in more harm than good.<br />Second: Change is bad:  Again, this depends on the situation.  When I wrote Strike Hard ..., it signaled a change in my life, and the life of my family.  Was it bad?  Absolutely not!  No one has been harmed by this, and many people have been able to benefit from it. (people gain enjoyment from reading it, my publisher sells it, etc.)  It has had a resounding effect of changing my life, but for the better.<br />All in all, I would agree with some of the other reviews on here and recommend that you not waste your money.  There is nothing in this that isn't learned from living your life day-by-day.  It has been mentioned that some employers are requiring this to be reading material of employees.  In that case, I would recommend a change---a change of employers.	2001-08-05

Dominick Dunne has scribed a worthy recounting of the horrors of justice in this country today.  Too many times there are stories of horrendous killings, crimes, and other injustices that cry out for action to be taken.  However, too many times the punishments do not fit the crimes.<br />Today's society has become relaxed to the notion of punishment.  People commit henious crimes, only to receive light sentences because of  their claims that they were &quot;not in their right mind&quot;, or &quot;they were taking drugs&quot;, or some other pitiful excuse.  His story of his own daughter's murder is a classic example of how the justice system coddles these people, looking for excuses that have no right in being used as reasons for criminal activity.<br />Psychologists and society are looking too hard at a person's childhood, drug activities, and pseudo-mental states when determining guilt or innocence in the world today.  It's shocking, and this book puts the facts in your face, where they should be.	2001-08-05

Joel Rosenberg has cemented his status in the fantasy-fiction world with his third installment of the Guardians of the Flame Series.  The title in itself is prophetic, and to have Karl leading the region is somnething no one could have expected.  As I said earlier in another review, Mr. Rosenberg does not mince when it comes to the question of likeable characters getting hurt seriously or killed off.  There were many times in this book that I was upset about what happened to a favorite character, but I realize that Mr. Rosenberg is putting as much &quot;reality&quot; in it as possible.  Characters do NOT live forever, and yes, sometimes the favorite ones get killed.<br />Once again, Mr. Rosenberg has outdone the preceeding edition, and I am sure that he will continue to do so.	2001-08-02

I have to say that I was thoroughly impressed with this outing.  While most sequels are stale and transparent, Joel Rosenberg manages to take up where The Sleeping Dragon left off and create a mystical tale that keeps the readers attention from the first page to the last.<br />Admittedly, I let out a yelp of joy when Karl announced to the slaver, &quot;Tell you masters that I am hunting them!&quot;  It showed a glimmer of what was to come in this series (especially this installment), and it did not disappoint.<br />I won't allow myself to announce any spoilers for those who haven't enjoyed this, but let me say that it was delightfully intriguing when the secret of Deighton was revealed.  The implications of this information should have an enormous impact in future volumes.	2001-08-02

As the author of Strike Hard (and an avid gamer), I found this to be one of the best fantasy-fiction books that I have ever read.  Joel Rosenberg showed that he could easily blend two totally seperate worlds together into one story and have it flow with ease.<br />I have to admit that there are many things that &quot;pushes&quot; someone to take up writing.  This book (and the whole Guardians of the Flame series) gave me the final push to start my own writing career.<br />Karl, Walter, Jason, James, Andrea, Doria, and Lou were easy to relate to, having spent my own share of weekends playing similar games.  Their attention to their characters were great, and it was a detail that Mr. Rosenberg did not skimp on.  Most people don't realize that when you are gaming, you really do care about a character that has been brought up from a total novice into something that is relatively formidable.<br />Another aspect that I really enjoyed was that Mr. Rosenberg stuck with the harsh realities of gaming.  He did not, at any time, make it seem as if the characters were immortal or supermen.  Characters suffered, died, and agonized, just like real people.  Most of the books in this genre that I read are afraid to take a step toward seriously harming a main character because they develop a fear that it will detract from the story.  Mr. Rosenberg tackles this with dignity in that he demonstrates a willingness to &quot;tell it like it is.&quot;<br />This book (as well as the series) is a wonderful example of fantasy at its finest.	2001-08-02

Jay Winik has somehow managed to find all of the quirks of fate that made this month in history so fantastic.  As the author of Strike Hard, I found this to be most interesting, since I am enthralled by history.<br />Little events, such as Lee's trains, don't seem to be much of a diference.  However, when one stops to look at the whole picture, it is an important event that was a turning point.<br />One thing that I didn't see was how much of an impact the assassination of Lincoln truly was.  Many people don't know that it was quite possible, had Lincoln lived, that HE would have faced impeachment instead of Johnson.  However, this is a small and trite eventuality, and does not detract from the book at all.<br />I firmly recommend this book to anyone who loves history in any way.  It is informative, eye-opening, and just plain enjoyable.	2001-07-30
US	44056210	R2Q2NAFJON1718	0670899097	235723201	Dante (Penguin Lives)	Books	4	1	5	N	N	Very good work!	R.W.B. Lewis does a wonderful job of creating a biography of Dante. It is difficult to try and imagine what a person's life was like so long ago, and even more difficult to analyze the writings of such a person. Mr. Lewis does this in fine fashion.<br />Really, the only problem that I found was trying to correlate the autobiographical information that Mr. Lewis pulls from Dante's writings. In my opinion, I cannot see how someone from this era can even begin to presume that certain contexts from writing are autobiographical.<br />Overall though, the work is very well done. I would recommend it to anyone who loves reading the classics, and about the creators of the classics.	2001-07-30

As the author of Strike Hard, I am intrigued by the manner with which other authors manage to captivate and hold their reader's attention.  Kathy Reichs has done just that, creating a story that kept me turning page after page in an effort to finish the story without stopping.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves suspense/thrillers, or has any type of interest in Forensic Science.

While his stories always seem to have a wave of what I term &quot;Wacky Humor&quot; to them, The Fourth Hand didn't even seem worth the effort.  The premise of it being a &quot;story of love&quot; was completely lost on me, and seemed to center more on a morbidness.<br />Hopefully his next one will be a lot better.	2001-07-29

As the author of Strike Hard, I found this book to be one of superb quaity in the aspect of frighteningly realistic.  $oft Money explores the dark and twisted underbelly of political campaign contributions that are in the forefront of today's headlines.<br />Currently, there are a number of debates on Capitol Hill concerning campaign money and the format by which it is contributed.  Many times over the years, we have seen news articles that talk about corruption and scandal associated with the so-called &quot;soft money&quot; of politics.  E.L. Burton has taken this and turned it into a story that shows all of the implications involved with these monies, and how even those who go to Washington with the best intentions can come out being on the wrong side of the corruption fence.<br />&quot;Absolute Power corrupts Absolutely&quot;, and &quot;Money is the root of all Evil&quot;, are catch phrases that everyone associates with government politics today.  This book explores how one man can be held in thrall by these two &quot;magic potions&quot; - power and money, and how another can be torn between friendship and duty.<br />E.L. Burton has managed to tell a story that is one of the best new novels of this millennium, and shows promise of being one of the stalwart authors that will dictate the basis for corruption/suspense novels for years to come.	2001-07-29

As the author of Strike Hard, and an avid reader of conspiracy suspense novels, I was quite taken by Norm Harris' freshman novel &quot;Fruit of a Poisonous Tree&quot;.  I found the story to be well-written and fast-paced, with a generous helping of suspense, action, and a number of other qualities.<br />Set in the Northwest, Fruit of a Poisonous Tree exemplifies the age-old suspicion that the government will go to any lengths to cover-up its activities.  Norm Harris has captured this in bold style, showing how the government has no thoughts at all of ruining one person's life for the sake of keeping their secrets.<br />Being a former U.S. Army NCO, I could relate to a lot of the scenes in the book that dealt with the everyday doldrums of military life.  The dialog was as realistic as any average encounter in the military, and did not detract from anything.  In fact, the story was written in such a way that I found myself wondering if Norm had been following his characters around and writing this story as it were actually happening.<br />Norm Harris has proven, in his first outing, that the world can fully expect to see more from him.  His style and prose shows a self-confidence that can only be a forecast of the work coming from this author in the future.	2001-07-29

However, that proves almost to be his undoing as he is located and pursued by two of the worst gang leaders that have come along.  They're not as bad as Hartline, but enough to twist Ben's guts into such a wrinkle that he's bound and determined to rid the world of them right here and now.  Again, there are not enough words, or enough room here to really say what should be said.  William Johnstone has an uncanny ability to make you wonder if he has received gifted insight into the future.  A future that is frightening, yet comforting to know that Ben and his people are there and ready to go!	2001-06-26

A brilliant strategic move helps to make his decision for him, resulting in the most amazing turn of events that will have you reeling!

Just when you get the idea that William Johnstone is going to bore us with the IPF and Hartline, he takes a wild twist.  It has been talked about for decades by sociologists that should a disaster of this magnatude happen, cults of all types would rise up around the world.  The Ninth Order is as despicable as Sam Hartline, only more of them.  And the surprising discovery that Ben makes concerning Sister Voleta is enough to have your eyes popping out and re-reading it to see if what you thought you read was really that.  This is also another great example of how each installment of the Ashes series is a book unto itself, but a part of the whole story.  Sit down, strap yourself in, and get ready for a wild ride.  Just don't expect the story to slow down long enough to get off..and who would want to?	2001-06-26

As we learn of a threat from a former Soviet General, Ben Raines is attempting to muster his people and start anew.  The dialogue and suspense of this novel clearly shows that William Johnstone has a hit of a series on his hands.  We see in this installment how Ben just wants him and his people to be left alone to carve out a society that is as best for all as possible.  But, with the horror that the IPF is bringing, along with the diabolical Sam Hartline, Ben and his people know that they are the nation's only hope.  Sam Hartline is the quintessential villan, and every page makes you despise him more than you would think possible.	2001-06-26

As the author of &quot;Strike Hard&quot;, I continually read books that piqued my interest.  &quot;Out of the Ashes&quot;, the first of the Ashes Series, was one of the most enjoyable that I have ever read.  Ben Raines seems to be a reflection of William Johnstone, thus adding a lot of depth to the character.  Johnstone manages to put the reader right in the middle of the war, and its aftermath, plunging the reader into a world where chaos exists.  However, there is a desire to see things set right, and Ben Raines is the man for the job.  From punks to outlaws, Ben manages to strive victoriously to clear the way for the rebirth of the country, in the way it was meant to be.  First of a series, &quot;Out of the Ashes&quot; is a terrific stand-alone novel, as well as an enticing beginning to a wonderful series.  It is a book that I never tire of reading.	2001-05-10

I utilized many of the concepts that he discusses in the working for the sequel to my novel, and have been given new avenues to follow during this.  I found the biographical information humorous, sad, and informative.  In my own quest to join the literary world, I found many of the same stumbling blocks that Mr. King did, and have used his experiences to avoid a few also.        In conclusion, I feel that &quot;On Writing&quot; gave me an insight into the mystical world of authors, and has helped me look forward to my own career with renewed interest and vigor.	2001-05-08
