She still gets many things wrong-NOT ALL WITCHES ARE WICCAN, for example, but she seems to be trying.<BR>I would recommend anything by Cunningham, Buckland or Dunwich above this book, but if you are a teen who, for whatever reason, feels you need a dumbed down teen book, this is heads and tails over &quot;Teen Witch&quot; for quality.<BR>That being said, I feel the target age for this book is about 11-12, and I'm not sure it's appropriate for that age. As a mother of teens, if I gave it to my girls, they'd be offended.<BR>That, with all the other problems with Ravenwolf makes this a good book to pass over.<BR>Kids don't need Wicca dumbed down or misrepresented, they are just as capable of reading Cunningham as any of us old farts.	2003-08-03

This book tries, and fails, to fill a hole in the practice of many pagans, but instead ends up a shadow of what good magick books are. I really suggest a beginner in Magick start with the Kybalion (available free online all over the place) and Magick in Theory and Practice.<br />EVEN Clifford Bias and Manley P. Hall, those (giggle) bastions (giggle) of Ceremonial Magick (giggle) are better for beginners than this.<br />I felt this book over simplified Magick and talked down to the audience. Magick is not &quot;easy&quot; in many ways, and if you can't work though a Crowley book, should you bother manipulating your will to any effects other than education?<br />In short: Too Easy, Too simple and not too useful.	2003-08-01

Cunningham is in his element when he writes of beliefs, but when he writes (or writes with help, or is invoked) about other stuff, it tends to be less good.<BR>I'd recommend this book highly because it's the best book on the subject of oils and the rest, but, at the same time, how often do you use this stuff?

A new edition, with history based on the current research, is probably in order. As it is, I suggest supplementing it with books on history and belief, and using it more as a workbook or for practice.<br />It really is one of the best books out there, but it is dated.	2003-08-01
