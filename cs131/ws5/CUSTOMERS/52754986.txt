I was very pleasantly surprised to see how often it refers to previous books, especially The Prisoner of Azkaban. It was like seeing old friends you haven't thought of for a while. That being said, if you have a young child (under 7) this book is just not for them. In addition to the death of a much-loved character, the Order of the Phoenix is far too long and draws thing out way too much to keep a young child's interest. Also, the references to previous books just confuses young kids, who have enough trouble remembering things that happened yesterday. In addition, Harry is gaining his voice in this latest installment. He's not afraid to talk back, be disrespectful or even rude, and he does not bottle up his frustration and anger and anxiety like he used to -- very healthy for preteens and teens who also need to learn not to internalize their emotions, but a bad example for young children who would mimic their hero, Harry. The level of anger and angst is also a bit much for sensitive young readers. However, for those who are old enough to handle the lengthy chapters, the references, etc., the book is very entertaining, especially the continued escapades of Fred and George Weasley. We never learn who gets the House Cup, though, and the book raises many questions that we'll undoubtedly have to wait another 3 years to have answered.	2003-06-30

Fortress of Dragons was billed as the finale to the series, which involved intrigue, magic, envy, desire, battle, love, you name it -- all the good stuff. The hero, Tristen, is a true innocent, a Summoning and Shaping who has yet to experience a full year being alive (again) and who does not remember much at all of his past life. There are so many parts in this book where Cherryh builds you up, gets you all nervous and excited... and then lets you down with a really boring follow up. The end of the novel itself, which was supposed to wrap up the Fortress trilogy, is so vague and fails to answer so many questions you want to throw the book across the room. I was disappointed.	2003-04-16

While it doesn't go into esoterics or much depth, this book is an excellent introduction into the festivals and practices and wards and charms and beliefs behind Shintoism. You'll finish with an understanding of a fascinating world religion, and many may find their intellect whetted for more... which this book unfortunately doesn't offer. However, for businessfolk who head to Japan often, for students going abroad to Japan, and for anime and manga fans looking for background info, this is a great source.	2003-04-06

Knowing my interest in past-life regressions, by hypnotherapist suggested I read this book. She thought I'd find it fascinating, and she was right... the story of the woman who is the main subject of this book just resonates with you -- but only if you're not a skeptic (if you are, don't even bother buying this book). The more you read, the more you wonder about your own past lives and the more you want to find out about regression therapy. The problem? Once you put the book down, you snap out of the haze it induces and then forget about most of everything you've read.

If you're looking at volume 2 of Ranma 1/2, you've either joined the club of those addicted to the world of Saotome Ranma, or you clicked on any Ranma 1/2 book link to see what all the hoopla about Ranma is about. For these folks, here's your synopsis!<br />Created/written/illustrated by Takahashi Rumiko (also responsible for Japan's current hit \\"Inu-Yasha\\" and cult favorite \\"Maison Ikkoku\\"), Ranma 1/2 tells the saga of teen martial artist Saotome Ranma, who had the misfortune of falling into a cursed spring on a training trip in China. The curse causes him to become a curvy young redhead female version of himself whenever he is splashed by cold water (tea, rain, anything wet). His rather irresponsible father, Genma, also fell into a spring, but his curse causes him to change into a panda. The manga (more than 30 volumes in the original Japanese) follows their (mis)adventures as Ranma and his dad move in with old family friend Tendo Soun, whose youngest daughter, tomboy Akane, Ranma happens to be engaged to (an arrangement neither teen is pleased with). Ranma encounters challenges at school and in his training from suitors of both genders who are either aware or unaware of his curse, as well as from rivals who either want to thrash him soundly or claim Akane as their own.<br />It is important to note that the Japanese are very frank about such subjects as bathing and nudity, and poor Ranma is often caught with his shirt off when he gets splashed... and in time learns to use his \\"feminine wiles\\" to get what he wants. There is, however, no sex, despite the anime's listing by Viz Video as a \\"martial arts sex comedy.\\" Gender comedy is more like it, since the main characters don't even kiss... well, except once, but Ranma was in cat-mode then (you need to read the series to figure out THAT one). <br />In summary, Ranma 1/2 is entertaining, very easy to follow, and well drawn, with characters that have their own personalities and quirks and are different from each other,with plots that keep you riveted, if not laughing -- or groaning -- on Ranma's behalf. An excellent introduction to Japanese manga.	2003-01-09

Well, it wasn't. I haven't gone and counted exactly how many positions there are (I'm guessing perhaps 50, tops) but some are rather mundane no-brainers (missionary, woman-on-top, doggie-style) and the majority of the rest are variations on those. Personally, I don't count moving a leg a few inches a new position! The pictures were interesting (my husband wondered how they got models for it and whether they wore paper pasties, like in Hollywood), but some were just ridiculous (the strip-tease section, for instance). I was hoping this book was more of an encyclopedia, showing and describing 101 positions to try.  Instead, I got a colorful rehash of what we mostly already know.	2003-01-04

This book is not a disappointment. It reads easily and  quickly draws you into the world of India Lindley. While not on par with  Small's masterpieces (Adora, Skye O'Malley, Enchantress Mine),  &quot;Bedazzled&quot; still entertains. Words of note: best to avoid this  novel until you've read all the other Skye O'Malley books. You'll be  somewhat lost if you haven't read the others first. Also, the dialog at  India's first meeting with the bey seems somewhat stiff -- again, this is  due to Ms. Small's formula for a historical romance, and is easily  overlooked.	2000-04-18
