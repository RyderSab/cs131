The heroine of \\"It Happened One Autumn\\" is the brash American heiress Lillian Bowman. Along with her younger sister Daisy and under the watchful eye of her social-climbing mother, Lillian has come to England in the hope of marrying into the British aristocracy.  In the first book in the series (\\"Secrets of a Summer Night\\") Lillian clashed memorably with Lord Westcliff, a stuffy, autocratic member of the British peerage.  In this book, Lillian and Westcliff are front and center in the story and their head-on collision and oil-and-water chemistry is a delight to behold.    Lillian is an excellent heroine--high-spirited, willful, bold, outspoken, uncomfortably direct and a bit cynical; she is a wealthy heiress by virtue of her father's business interests, but readily admits the fact that her grandmother was a dock washerwoman.  Lillian is the antithesis of the demure, well-bred bride that Westcliff has always intended to choose as his countess.  Westcliff, the survivor of a harsh childhood with a brutal, unloving father who groomed him to always do his duty to the earldom, is an unfailing honorable man but a bit of a prig.  Westcliff has spent his life invariably doing the correct and proper thing and is appalled to find himself attracted to the American hoyden.  The clashes between these two strong-willed people are tremendously entertaining, particularly watching the arrogant Westcliff completely lose his famously cool head when Lillian dares to defy him.    The plot of the story moves along very well with Lillian and Westcliff initially attempting to deny then to come to terms with their unexpected (well, to them anyways) attraction to each other and then gradually discovering the deeper facets of each other's personality.  Realizing that despite their mutualattraction, Westcliff considers her the precisely wrong woman to take as his wife, Lillian begins a flirtation with the fabulously handsome and rakish Sebastian, Lord St. Vincent.  Although Sebastian is obviously being set up as the hero for the next book in the series, he is far more than wallpaper in this story.  His character is well-developed and he actually plays a pivotal (although rather illogical and far-fetched if one wants to quibble) role in the denouement.      In summary, this is a very entertaining and well-written installment in the \\"Wallflower\\" series featuring an unusually vibrant and interesting heroine and a complex, attractive hero.  The secondary characters, the Wallflowers and Westcliff's friends and family, are well-developed and the story has a lot of sparkle.  The sex scenes are smoking hot but in no way overwhelm the story.    Highly recommended.	2005-10-01
US	48354998	R27AJLEF7QEA4F	0743496108	357668604	One Little Sin	Books	4	48	51	N	N	Really 3 1/2 -- Great Premise but the story takes forever to get going	I unabashedly adore Liz Carlyle's books so I pounced on this book when I found it in the bookstore.  \\"One Little Sin\\" is the first book in Liz Carlyle's new trilogy featuring Sir Alasdair MacLachlan and Quin Hewitt, Lord Wynwood (hero Devellyn's drinking buddies from \\"The Devil to Pay\\"), along with Alasdair's brilliant but morose brother Merrick as heroes.  The set-up is wonderful with the three men being told by a mysterious gypsy fortune-teller that the sins of their pasts will be catching up with them soon.  The three laugh it off but later that evening Alasdair is awakened by a thunderstorm and a knock on his door.  Into his life arrives penniless Scottish-born Miss Esmee Hamilton and a toddler that she tells him is her half-sister and his daughter, Sorcha.  Alasdair has no memory at all of the girls's recently deceased mother, Lady Archanalt, and only the vaguest drunken recollection of doing something behind the velvet curtains at the party in question, but Sorcha resembles his brother so he accepts Esmee's story.  He panics when he realizes that Esmee intends to leave Sorcha with him and ends up bribing her to stay in the position of the child's governess.    Then begins a very long (and surprisingly uninteresting) section of the book in which Esmee and Alasdair are living in the same house and trying to deny their burgeoning attraction to one another.  Alasdair is 36 years old and believes that he is too old and too jaded for the innocent 22 year old Esmee (besides the slight detail that he is apparently the father of her half-sister.)  Esmee realizes that Alasdair is a shameless rogue and womanizer and worries that her attraction to him may be a sign of her mother's wild blood in her.  This is a set-up that historical romance readers frankly have seen at least a hundred times before and there is nothing really all that new going on in this part of the book.  Eventually the couple must part (a scene with overtones of Georgette Heyer's \\"Venetia\\") and with 100pages to go the book finally catches fire (during a scene with an actual fire in a theater.)     Alasdair is such a charming, shameless ne'er-do-well that I found it impossible not to like him.  He is a handsome, hopeless womanizer as established from the first scene in which he is caught with his pants down with the wife of a very large and angry blacksmith.  He has a good head for numbers which enables him to make his living at the card tables but basically he lives for his own pleasure.  Despite his charm and good looks, he has always felt like a misfit among his dour, brilliant Scottish family.  Refreshingly, he admits that he has no dark secret in his past or broken heart in his youth to justify his bad behavior--he is a self-indulgent scoundrel and wastrel because that is what he chooses to be.      Esmee is a less compelling heroine, to my mind.  She is your typical tart-tongued Scottish virginal heroine (why do all Scottish heroines have to be \\"tart-tongued\\", I wonder?)  Her speech is liberally peppered with things like \\"Och!\\", \\"the wee bairn\\", \\"wee trootie\\", \\"dinna kin\\" to the point where I start feeling as though she is verbally interchangeable with Alasdair's Granny MacGregor.  Of course, because this is a romance novel, Alasdair is enchanted by her shrewish plain speaking and his heart is softened by her love for her baby sister.  Frankly, she never seems interesting enough to me to attract the long-term attention of a gorgeous, hardened rogue like Alasdair.  She keeps inviting his kisses then berating him after he complies, never my favorite behavior pattern in a romance heroine.     Liz Carlyle's writing is top-notch as usual, and her sex scenes are wonderfully sensual.  The plot twists can be seen coming a mile away, but the book is still very enjoyable.  Despite the pacing problems with the first half of the story and a rather lack-luster heroine, the story is worth reading for the \\"comeuppance\\" of the charming, unrepentant rogue who is Alasdair.  Recommended.	2005-09-25
US	48354998	R2UROJY0P409CG	0821777750	790440204	A Season To Be Sinful	Books	5	29	31	N	N	Well-written romance with rich, complex characterizations	This is only the second book of Jo Goodman's that I have read, but clearly I have been missing something.  \\"A Season to Be Sinful\\" is a wonderfully rich and complex Regency historical romance of the type that is unfortunately too rare these days.  The writing is intelligent and evocative, the characters complex and memorable and the plot interesting.      The story at first glance seems a little bit contrived--a young woman disguised as a scruffy boy rescues a rather stuffy young viscount from an assassin's knife in Covent Garden.  Summoned to her sick bed by three adorable street urchins (named Pinch, Dash and Midge), Viscount Sheridan (called Sherry) discovers that the young woman has taken the knife than was meant for him and is gravely ill.  He quickly realizes that she is more than she seems upon hearing her gently-bred speech.  Lily, the heroine, is actually in hiding in the slums of London after fleeing from the ever-so-evil Baron Woodridge, a pervert who had taken her from a French abbey purportedly to be his children's governess and then used her as his own sexual plaything.  This is pretty heavy stuff for a historical romance and likely will not be to all reader's taste, but romance lovers who like character driven romance and prefer grittier, more complex stories will be rewarded for their effort in \\"A Season to Be Sinful\\".  Jo Goodman transforms this plot (which admittedly has \\"bodice-ripper\\" overtones) into a nuanced story of healing and discovery between her well-matched hero and heroine.    The characters of both Lily and Sherry and finely drawn and wonderfully deep.  Sherry (and his name to me sounded not feminine as suggested by another reviewer, but *terribly* British upper class) is a remarkable hero--attractive, intelligent and full of dry wit, but also rigidly correct and emotionally restrained.  It is a pleasure seeing Sherry gradually open himself up to Lily and the three boys and to peel back the layers of his complex character.  Lily is a worthy heroine, damaged but not broken by her horrible past, she begins to slowly and realistically heal her wounds under Sherry's care.  The story unfolds gradually as Lily and Sherry learn to trust each other and share the secrets of their pasts.  Their developing romance is sweet and believable and the love scenes are not only wonderfully sensual but also integral to the plot and to Lily's healing.      The book is not perfect in that the plot has a few too many coincidences for my taste, and the villain is a little too relentlessly evil; however, the dialogue is so sharp and intelligent, the writing is so beautiful and descriptive and the characterizations so marvelous (even the children are engaging despite their rather \\"too cute\\" names) that I found myself overlooking the few flaws.    Highly recommended for lovers of richer, darker, and more complex historical romance.	2005-09-03
US	48354998	R31PH3X6WH5HZT	084395552X	429894316	The Lily Brand	Books	3	40	40	N	N	Unique but very dark premise for a romance	\\"The Lily Brand\\" is the debut novel for Sandra Schwab and it shows promise for an author who is willing to take some risks with her characters and plots.  It is far from a standard Regency historical romance--the story is dark and moody, and the characters' psychological development is the focus.    The hero of the story is Murgatroyd Sacheverell, the fifth Earl of Ravenhurst (called \\"Troy\\" for short, thank heavens!)  Captured by the French before the battle of Waterloo, he is in a filthy French prison when the ever-so-evil \\"Black Widow\\" Camille picks him out and takes him home as a \\"gift\\" for her young stepdaughter, Lily.  Camille is an over-the-top villainess who likes to torture and beat her male \\"playthings\\" into groveling submission and she wants Lily to follow in her footsteps.  She has Lily literally brand Troy with a hot iron and lead him around on a chain.  Lily, too frightened of her stepmother to object, secretly plans her own escape and manages to flee to her grandfather's protection in England.    Six months later, Lily, having been accepted by London society and being courted by a young viscount, is introduced to the viscount's cousin who is (of course!) Troy.  Lily and Troy instantly recognize one another and Troy launches a desperate attempt to prevent his young cousin from marrying a woman that he believes to be an evil bi**h.  Troy's plan backfires and he ends up having to marry the woman he loathes himself.  Troy, filled with rage and shame, cuts himself off from his new wife, and Lily, full of guilt and shame, freezes him out.  With the help of time, Troy's friends and Lily's nanny, Troy slowly comes to realize that Lily was as much a victim as himself and gradually the couple begin to heal their damaged hearts and minds.        The psychological exploration of the characters is well done and interesting.  Both Lily and Troy are suffering from a type of Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome following their horrific and dehumanizing experiences.  The book gets a little bit redundant in parts, with Troy and Lily going over and over in their own minds the incidents of the past and stewing in their respective rage and guilt.  I found the evil stepmother Camille a bit too much to be believed and ridiculously overt in her perversions.  I also cannot see why she would want to \\"cut off the balls\\" from someone that she is planning to use as a sex toy--seems to me that making her sex toys into eunuchs limits their usefulness.  Troy's school chums, a homosexual couple, were a refreshing addition to the story, but Lily and Troy's blithe acceptance of what at that time was considered to be a very scandalous (and illegal) relationship seems a bit anachronistic.       In summary, this is an unusual and rather dark historical romance set in the Regency period.  The book is certainly not without its problems, but the characters are interesting and the story unique and atmospheric.  The subject matter is very dark in some parts with scenes of torture and Camille's violent and nonviolent sexual perversions so *major* warnings to readers who dislike that sort of thing in a romance novel.	2005-08-29
US	48354998	R3C1CDJSV9PU5D	0060734558	645452526	Match Me If You Can: A Novel	Books	4	73	81	N	N	Smart and sassy but takes awhile to find its heart!	\\"Match Me If You Can\\" is a delightful book by Susan Elizabeth Phillips, full of memorable characters and bright, witty dialogue.  It is the latest entry in her \\"Chicago Stars\\" football team series of books and features characters from the other books in the series (such as the Somerville sisters and their husbands) as secondary characters. <br /> <br />The heroine of the story, Annabelle Granger, is a charming but rather hapless redhead--a chronic underachiever born into a family of super-achievers.  When Annabelle inherits her grandmother's matchmatching business (\\"Matches by Myrna\\") she changes the name to \\"Perfect for You\\" and sets out to make her new business a success.  The key its success, she believes, is to land gorgeous Heath Champion, bachelor extraordinaire and wealthy sports agent, as a client.  Heath is looking for a wife and has engaged a rival matchmaking service (\\"Power Matches\\" run by the ruthlessly perfect Portia Powers) to introduce him to likely candidates since he is just *too busy* with his work to look for a wife on his own.  Annabelle goes after Heath's business with a vengeance, but cannot help taking a few jabs at his over-inflated ego.  Heath is looking to the \\"perfect\\" woman to complement his \\"perfect\\" life. (Annabelle sums up his requirements for a wife:  \\"Athletic, domestic, gorgeous, brilliant, socially connected, and pathologically submissive.\\")  Heath is only willing to meet the \\"candidates\\" initially for a 20 minute interview and insists that Annabelle be present for all the first meetings.  Of course none of the candidates is ever as perfect for Heath as Annabelle herself, but it takes him absolutely *forever* to figure this out. <br /> <br />Annabelle is a charming heroine--smart, warm-hearted, vulnerable and fun-loving.  Heath is much harder to warm up to as a hero.  His nickname is \\"The Python\\" since he squeezes money out of the team owners and sponsors for his clients, and he is suitably cold-blooded for that name to be appropriate.  He is gorgeous, intelligent, driven and rich, but also a double cell-phoned workaholic full of smarmy charm and shallow emotions.  I found it surprising that more of the \\"candidates\\" did not reject *him* after the first 20 minute meeting.  Heath realizes that he is attracted to Annabelle but dismisses her as potential wife material since she does not fit his preconceived ideal of the beautiful, polished, perfect spouse.  He has absolutely *tons* of emotional baggage to come to terms with before he is able to recognize his true feelings for Annabelle.   <br /> <br />The dialogue is sharp and witty and it is a delight to revisit characters like Phoebe Somerville Calebow (heroine of \\"It Had to Be You\\"), the owner of the Chicago Stars and Heath's arch-enemy since she was forced to cave in to his hardball negotiating tactics early in his career as a sports agent.  (Heath says at one point: \\"It's been seven years, Phoebe.  Don't you think it's time we bury the hatchet?\\"  To which Phoebe replies: \\"As long as the blade ends up in the back of your neck, I'm game.\\") The plot moves along fairly well, but it takes a long time (I mean, a *long* time!) for Heath to realize that Annabelle is the right woman for him and his epiphany when it does occur seems startlingly abrupt.   <br /> <br />In summary, \\"Match Me If You Can\\" is a fun and fast read with the type of memorable characters and sparkling dialogue typical of Susan Elizabeth Phillips.   <br />Highly recommended.	2005-08-12
US	48354998	RJAEP1HIP1JAE	0440217784	655658960	The Thief's Mistress	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Unique and  compelling story but *not* for the faint-hearted!	\\"The Thief's Mistress\\" is a love-it-or-hate-it kind of book, but I must say that I *thoroughly* enjoyed it and gobbled it up in a single day.  The book is a retelling of the Robin Hood/Maid Marian legend with Marian placed front and center in the story.  Marian as she is envisioned in this story is a combination of an ice princess and dispenser of vigilante justice.  Unusually tall, beautiful, intelligent and schooled in the use of weapons, she is a rarity among historical romance heroines--tough, flawed, clever and virtually never requiring rescue by the hero.  The book has not only a wonderful hero in the golden, charming and recklessly bold Robin Hood, but also a *very* compelling anti-hero/villain in the dark and sexy Sir Guy of Guisbourne.  The love triangle between Marian, Robin and Guy is wonderfully well done and is really the heart of the story.  It is made more fascinating by the fact that Marian feels passion for both men and is a closer match personality-wise to dark, clever and controlled Sir Guy than to open and sunny Robin.  The characters are beautifully drawn and the writing is excellent.  The story is packed with political intrigue with Marian acting as a spy for Queen Eleanor (of Aquitaine) who is trying to ransom her son Richard (the Lionhearted) from the Austrian emperor while protecting his kingdom from his grasping younger brother, Prince John.  <br />  <br />Gayle Feyrer manages to break just about every \\"rule\\" of historical romance writing--so traditionalists looking for a light and fluffy story beware!  The heroine is not only the \\"thief's mistress\\", she is also Sir Guy's mistress and the sex scenes with both her lovers are steamy. There is a fair amount of violence in the story, some perpetrated *by* and some *against* the major characters in the story.  Marian is a chilly, fairly ruthless heroine who fights her attraction to the outlaw Robin for a good portion of the story.   <br /> <br />This is a wonderfully unique and well written medieval for readers who enjoy character-driven romance with flawed heroes and heroines and stories with action and healthy dose of history.   <br />Highly recommended to readers looking for a grittier, more complex medieval romance.	2005-07-10
US	48354998	R2JCW7WUDYK4RC	0060774738	208784752	The Marriage Bed (Guilty Series)	Books	4	59	68	N	N	Really 3 1/2  stars -- Fascinating premise but falters a bit in the execution	It is a challenge to write a historical romance with a serial adulterer as the hero, but Laura Lee Guhrke *almost* pulls it off.  The hero of \\"The Marriage Bed\\" is Lord John Hammond, a charming, handsome rakish heartbreaker who has been estranged from his wife, Lady Viola Hammond for eight years at the beginning of the story.  Six months after their wedding, romantic young Viola had been stunned to learn that John had been keeping a mistress all during their courtship while simultaneously professing his love for Viola.  Sickened by his duplicity and realizing that he had only married her for her money, the headstrong Viola had locked John out of her bedroom and refused to listen to his (actually, rather lame) explanations.  Fed up with her behavior and accusations, John left her after a month and over the years has had a string of mistresses. Viola, meanwhile, has devoted herself to charity work since divorce is not an option. <br />   <br />When his cousin's death unexpectedly leaves John without a trustworthy heir to his title and property, he approaches Viola with a demand to again live as husband and wife in order to produce a son and heir.  Viola is unenthusiastic about the plan since he broke her heart as a young bride and since then has humiliated her for years with his series of mistresses.  John proceeds to try to charm and seduce his way back into a reluctant Viola's life. <br />   <br />John is certainly a charmer, but his careless treatment of the women in his life certainly is a less than heroic quality.  More fatally for his character (IMO), he lacks any sense of self-awareness--he does not seem to know what a jerk he is.  I tend to like flawed heroes and heroines, and I liked John fairly well although he remained a bit too selfish and immature for most of the book for my taste.  Viola is a reasonably good heroine--a proud woman trying desperately not to fall for the same lines and act that she had when she first fell in love with her husband. <br /><br />I thought that the premise had a lot of potential for exploring issues of betrayal and forgiveness within a marriage, and when the book concentrated on these themes I liked it a great deal. (\\"Do you love me?\\"  \\"Of course, I adore you.\\"  This exchange from their courtship is burned into Viola's mind as a symbol of John's duplicity.)  I liked less the scenes of John trying to seduce and sweet-talk his way back into Viola's life as if the past eight years had not happened.  I had a lot of trouble believing that she would fall for the same old routine from him, particularly since she knew that his seduction was motivated by a desire for an heir this time and not by rediscovered love. <br /> <br />The story is engaging with the focus fully on the hero and heroine and their attempts to rebuild their failed marriage. I liked this book and admire the author's willingness to take on a very controversial topic. <br /> <br />Recommended to historical romance readers who enjoy character-driven romance with flawed heroes and heroines (with warnings to those for whom adultery is a major turn-off in a romance novel.)	2005-07-08

This is the third book in Sabrina Jeffries's \\"Royal Brotherhood Series\\", historical romances set in England's Regency period featuring heroes who are illegitimate sons of the Prince of Wales.  \\"One Night with a Prince\\" is the story of Gavin Byrne, Prinny's unacknowledged son by an Irish actress.  It is an entertaining, well-written tale with an attractive hero and unusual heroine. <br /> <br />Gavin Byrne is one of the \\"self-made man\\" variety of romantic heroes, a man who has risen from a childhood spent in the gutters of London to become the wealthy owner of an exclusive gentleman's gambling club.  Prinny's denial and rejection of his mother, a childhood spent in desperate poverty and an unhappy love affair in his youth have left Byrne bitter and cynical.  Gorgeous and controlled, he has had many (many!) mistresses but (of course!) scorns the idea of falling in love and getting married. <br /> <br />The heroine of the story is Lady Christabel Haversham, a pretty and rather unconventional young widow who needs Gavin's help to recover a packet of scandalous letters concerning the Prince of Wales that her feckless husband stole from her and sold to the dastardly Lord Stokely in order settle a gambling debt. Christabel's plan involves posing as Gavin's mistress in order to secure an invitation to an exclusive gambling party at Lord Stokely's country home.  Gavin agrees to help her, privately planning to use the letters himself to get revenge on Prinny for his abandonment of his mother, and hoping to get Christabel to agree to be his mistress in truth.  <br /> <br />Gavin is an engaging hero--handsome, sexy, intelligent, but embittered by life.  I am always a sucker for stories with \\"heartless\\" heroes who find their souls through the love of a good woman.  Christabel is an interesting heroine, although a bit too much of a street-fighter for a gentlewoman from the Regency period to be believable and occasionally straying into the dreaded \\"feisty heroine\\" territory.  I did like the fact that she had a really bad temper--it was a nice quirk in her character.  She was disappointingly proper at the beginning of the story (numerous internal monologues vowing *never* to allow sexy Gavin Byrne to kiss, fondle or seduce her--vows (of course) instantly forgotten with the mere touch of Gavin's lips!)  She is also oddly innocent for a woman who was married for ten years, regardless of how much of a loser her husband may have been. <br />   <br />The book seemed to drag somewhat at the beginning with a bit too much exposition masquerading as dialogue, but the plot starts to move along as things heat up between Gavin and Christabel. (In an entertaining scene, he teaches her how to play \\"Whist for the Wicked\\"--a variant of strip poker.)  Fortunately, Christabel is a very quick study and becomes an expert whist player in a matter of only two weeks.  The plan to recover the letters is not exactly brilliant, but the romance is sweet (once the bickering is over) and the sensual scenes well done (althought I am not sure which night is the \\"One Night\\" referred to in the book's title.) <br /> <br />In summary, this is a very readable and enjoyable historical romance with an engaging hero and heroine.  It is my favorite in the \\"Royal Brotherhood Series\\".  <br />Recommended.	2005-06-29

The good news is that \\"Till We Next Meet\\" is a sweet, well-written tale with a Cyrano de Bergerac-style plot and a fine, attractive hero.  The bad news is that it took me absolutely *forever* to read this book and that is usually an indication that story is not quite as compelling as it could be.  The characters never really engaged me and the story seemed to hum along without a great deal of tension until the rather flat denouement where the villain is revealed. <br /> <br />Catherine Dunnan has only been married for a month when her handsome husband goes off to war, but she comes to love Harry deeply while he is away through their very lovely correspondence.  What she does not realize is that the letters that she treasures are not from her worthless, philandering husband at all, but penned in his name at his request by his commanding officer, Colonel Moncrief.  Moncrief, who began writing out of pity for a woman married to a cad, has become captivated by Catherine's warm and tender words and corresponds with her in an effort to ease his own loneliness.  When Harry is killed and Moncrief unexpectedly inherits a dukedom following his older brother's death, Moncrief pays a condolence visit to Catherine and finds the Harry's widow nearly paralyzed with her grief.  When circumstances force Moncrief to act to protect Catherine, he takes her back with him to his family home and tries to begin healing her grief while not revealing her husband's true nature or his own role in their correspondence.   <br /> <br />Moncrief is a very fine hero--handsome, honorable to a fault, passionate and sensitive--almost a bit too perfect, in fact.  His only flaw is his deception about who wrote the letters, an act initially of kindness and then of love, so not really such a black mark against him at all.  Catherine is a bit harder to relate to due to her blindness to Harry's true character and inability to appreciate Moncrief's sterling qualities (or recognize him as her true correspondent.)  She snaps out of her clinical depression midway through the book and becomes a more satisfying romantic heroine, but all the black nightgowns and grief over her worthless husband gets a bit wearying after a while.  To complicate matters, someone is trying to kill Catherine, requiring Moncrief to act as her protector (since Catherine clearly is really a horrible judge of character!) <br /> <br />The letters are really very lovely and the eventual romance between Catherine and Moncrief very passionate and satisfying, although I was never a bit concerned that Catherine would not forgive Moncrief when she discovered the deception about the letters.  The story seemed at times to lack momentum and the ending (particularly the wrap-up of the mystery of Catherine's \\"accidents\\") was rather implausible with the villain's motivation being questionable.  There is a scene near the end of the story of bizarrely excessive forgiveness of a character who has been complicit in trying to harm the hero and heroine that just was jarring to me. <br /> <br />In summary, this is a well-written historical romance with a promising set-up and wonderfully sensitive and honorable hero.  I would not consider \\"Till We Next Meet\\" to be one of Karen Ranney's *best* books, but it is entertaining tale with a touching love story and is well worth reading.	2005-05-16

It is a page-turner that I could barely put down with a dark, compelling hero and sympathetic heroine.      Chloe Underwood is an American in Paris, living in a tiny apartment and making a living by translating children's books into French.  One day, while translating a book about a ferret in a tutu, she ironically observes that she does not have enough sex and violence in her life....and (boy, oh, boy!) she *should* have been careful what she wished for!  Almost immediately, she is convinced by her flighty roommate to take her place as translator for a group of businessmen at a weekend conference outside of Paris.  Chloe needs the money, and she will get to wear her roommate's chic clothes, so she agrees.    Arriving at the remote chateau for the conference, Chloe is introduced to the participants, including the dangerously attractive and seductive Bastien Toussaint.  Unfortunately for Chloe, she is much sharper and more observant than her roommate, and it does not take her very long to figure out that the \\"entrepreneurs\\" are really illegal arms dealers.  A little bit of unwise snooping around, and Chloe has gotten herself into some *serious* trouble and finds herself on the run with Bastien from people who want her dead.    Chloe is an engaging heroine--young, confused by Bastien's attentions (and particularly by her own reactions to him), disastrously inquisitive, brave and fairly resourceful.  She does some really stupid things, but she is a likable and believable heroine.  Bastien is one of Anne Stuart's deliciously dangerous bad boy heroes.  A cross between the hero of her own book \\"Moonrise\\" and Robert Ludlum's Jason Bourne, Bastien is a marvelously complex hero--a sexy chameleon and efficient killer who has come to detest the type of work that he does and realize that there is not much difference between the sides working for good and evil in this type ofconflict.      The plot is face-paced and exciting and the sexual tension is excellently done.  The attraction between Chloe and Bastien is very believable and the sex scenes are smokin' hot.  My only complaint with the book was that it seemed to end rather abruptly (I actually turned the page looking for the next chapter, but that was it!)      In summary, this is an excellent romantic thriller with lots of action and a complex, attractive but morally ambiguous hero.  Fans of Anne Stuart will be delighted by \\"Black Ice\\".  I know that I enjoyed every minute of it!   Highly recommended!	2005-05-01
US	48354998	R6JDMN7C2J0ZR	0515139483	610175737	Dreams of Stardust	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Really 3 1/2 stars -- An Entertaining Story	This is the first book that I have read by Lynn Kurland, and I agree with other reviewers who state that \\"Dreams of Stardust\\" works as a stand-alone book (although it is littered with characters who are obviously the heroes and/or heroines of other books in her interlocking series of the de Piaget and MacLeod families.)  I found \\"Dreams of Stardust\\" to be an entertaining medieval time-travel romance, although a bit light on the romance and historical accuracy for my taste.   <br /> <br />The hero of the story is Jake Kilchurn, the son of a wealthy 21st century businessman, who has largely rejected his father's money and business dealings to pursue a lucrative career of his own in gem acquisition and jewelry design.  As a grudging favor to his father, Jake travels to Artane Castle (despite his strange sense of deja vu about the place) with some business papers for its owner, Lord Edward di Piaget.  On the way there he is in a car wreck and is transported back to the 13th century where he is rescued from a group of robbers by the beautiful Lady Amanda di Piaget and her younger brothers.  Jake falls almost instantly in love with Amanda and visa versa.  Amanda is 21 years old (that is *ancient* in medieval terms) but unmarried because she believes that all her suitors are just after her money.  She is an anachronism in other ways as well--she spends time sparring with her brothers in the lists, jogging around the lists, and planning solo escapes from the protection of her family.  She is spunky enough but frequently in a way which is idiotically reckless.  She chafes at the contingent of guards that follow her everywhere but seems to be able to elude them without too much difficulty when she wants to do so--*twice* she disguises herself and leaves the castle unchallenged.  <br /> <br />Jake and Amanda are a charming enough hero and heroine, but a bit underdeveloped (IMO).  They are both gorgeous and seem to fall in love with each other initially based on their good looks.  Jake later comes to admire Amanda's spirit and intelligence and Amanda likes the fact that Jake seems to love *her* and not her money.  There are class obstacles to overcome (Amanda is nobility and Jake a mere impoverished \\"merchant\\")--solved in a rather mundane manner by Jake returning to the future to get his money from Swiss bank accounts.   <br /> <br />The book is just chock *full* of characters--from Amanda's delightful family in medieval Artane to all the modern di Piaget and MacLeod relatives. Amanda's brothers are particularly fun, but so many characters tend to steal the limelight from the main hero and heroine.  Jake spends a lot of time (and I mean *a lot* of time) training at swordfighting and Amanda spends a lot of time worrying about whether things will work out with Jake.  The passion between the main couple is very restrained.  Some of the main action of the book is recounted by the characters in past tense after the fact, which I found perplexing.   <br /> <br />In summary, this is an entertaining medieval time-travel romance with a *very* large cast of engaging characters.  Devotees of Lynn Kurland's previous books will likely be *thrilled* to see so much of the heroes and heroines of previous books and their growing families (i.e. Robin and Anne, Kendrick and Genevieve, Gideon and Megan, Rhys and Gwennelyn.)	2005-04-30

While not as emotionally wrenching as \\"By Possession\\" or unique in character as \\"By Arrangement\\", \\"The Protector\\" is a well-told tale with a wonderfully strong hero and heroine and rich historical detail. <br /> <br />\\"The Protector\\" is the story of Morvan Fitzwaryn, brother of the heroine of \\"By Arrangement\\" and a knight who has sworn to regain his family's lost lands--lands that he had been forced to surrender as a young boy.  He encounters the lovely and unconventional Lady Anna de Leon when she rescues him from a group of fearful Breton villagers about to torch the cottage where he is sheltering with his plague-infected squire.  Anna has been left as the political and military leader of her Breton castle following the deaths of her father and brother and the devastation of her own people by the plague.  When Morvan himself is infected with the plague, Anna (who has survived the plague previously) nurses him and supports him emotionally and a special bond is forged between the two.  In gratitude, Morvan vows to protect Anna and lends his sword when Anna's enemies attempt to take over her castle.  Morvan is fascinated by Anna's strength and beauty, but Anna has vowed never to marry as she does not want to be in any man's power.   <br /> <br />Anna is a wonderfully unusual heroine, marvelously strong and capable of holding her own with the men on the battlefield, she is insecure about her own attractiveness and cannot believe that the gorgeous Morvan would want her for herself and not for her lands and wealth.  I found Morvan to be a hero worthy of Anna--strong enough to control her wilder impulses but gentle with her as well.  There is an onslaught of negative reviews on this site about Morvan (strangely, most dating from January 6th and 7th, 2005), criticizing him for being too domineering and crushing Anna's spirit, but I saw that part of the book as two *very* strong people learning toaccept each other and redistribute the balance of power.  Anna really had the majority of the power at the beginning of the book, and I would not have been happy to see her marry someone that she could ride roughshod over.   Morvan's rules and restrictions were primarily to protect her from her enemies and to maintain harmony in the castle.  The power clashes were inevitable and very realistic considering the very strong willed heroine and alpha male hero and the  compromises that both ultimately make for their love are touching. <br /> <br />In summary, this is a very well-written medieval with an unusually strong heroine and hero.  The historical details about the plague are interesting and well done. <br />Highly recommended.	2005-04-20

This is a really fun historical romance set in Egypt in 1821.  \\"Mr. Impossible\\" is the second book in a series by Loretta Chase detailing the lives and loves of the unruly sons of the Earl of Hargate (the first being \\"Miss Wonderful\\".)  I loved the Egyptian setting (being a devotee of Elizabeth Peter's Amelia Peabody series!) and enjoyed the interplay between the charmingly mismatched hero and heroine. <br /> <br />The hero, Rupert Carsington (\\"Mr. Impossible\\" himself!), is the Earl of Hargate's fourth son, a reckless hellion who has been sent to Egypt by his father in an attempt to keep him out of trouble.  But trouble follows Rupert wherever he goes, not in part because he *thrives* on it!  When the attractive and scholarly widow, Daphne Pembroke needs assistance in locating her kidnapped brother, Rupert is the best that the unhelpful British consul general has to offer.  Daphne is a linguistic genius, obsessed with deciphering hieroglyphs. Due to prejudice against her gender in the scholarly world, she and her brother, Miles, have long pretended that *he* is the language expert in the family.  Since Miles is kidnapped soon giving Daphne a valuable papyrus that reportedly describes the location of a royal tomb, Daphne fears that the villains may be trying to use Miles's purported language skills to locate the pharaoh's treasure.   <br /> <br />Rupert and Daphne provide the perfect yin and yang to the story.  He is all tall, dark and handsome strength and action and she is the practical brains of the operation.  Together they set off up the Nile in pursuit of Miles and the kidnappers.  The plot has *lots* of action--with murder attempts, sandstorms, and rival groups of ruthless villains.  There is delightful comic relief in the form of nutty servants (particularly the dramatic, pessimistic Leena), a devoted pet mongoose and Rupert's witty, irreverent repartee.  But the heart of the story is the irresistible lust and developing love between the reckless but honorable Rupert and brilliant but insecure Daphne.   <br /> <br />In summary, this is a delightful historical romance with an unusual setting and very engaging lead characters.   <br />Highly recommended!	2005-03-28

This is a fabulous short Regency by Mary Balogh and it is right up there with my favorites by her!  Boy, can she ever write great dialogue and create complex, three-dimensional characters!    Lord Edmond Waite and Mary Gregg, Lady Mornington, disliked each other without ever having met, solely based on each other's reputations.  Edmond is a notorious libertine--a vulgar, mocking rake who is only barely accepted by the members of the ton despite his wealth and noble birth, and Mary is a respectable widow famous for her literary and political salons and intelligent conversation.  When chance strands them alone together in the Vauxhall gardens during a sudden storm, Mary's pathologic fear of thunder and lightning leads to intense intimacy and the two become lovers for the evening.    The next morning, Mary, more than a little appalled by her own behavior during and after the storm, wishes to forget the whole incident, but Edmond finds himself unaccountably intrigued by the passionate woman he has discovered beneath her prim facade and begins a relentless pursuit (to Mary and her friends's horror!)    Both Mary and Edmond are *excellent* characters--complex, conflicted and so real.  I particularly loved the way that they are swept along by a passion that they fight against and cannot intellectually explain to themselves.  Edmond's history is so well done and brilliantly fleshes out his character--transforming a seemingly heartless rake into a very deep, vulnerable man.  The secondary characters, particularly Edmond's aunt, Lady Eleanor, and his sister-in-law, Anne, are great.    Bravo (once again) Mary Balogh and thank you for a wonderful book!

I agree with the other reviewer that said that this book is not what one would expect based on the catchy, titillating title and light-hearted summary on the back cover, but \\"The Naked Duke\\" is a very readable Regency romance with an engaging hero and reasonably good heroine.    Miss Sarah Hamilton, in compliance with her father's deathbed wish, has traveled from Philadelphia to England (*very* improbably--completely *alone*) to visit her uncle, the Earl of Westbrooke.  Exhausted, she stops for the night at an inn near her uncle's estate and is nearly turned away by the innkeeper (as a presumed whore) because of her solitary, disheveled state.  When a semi-drunk gentleman offers her a open room, she believes that it is a case of mistaken identity (and, of course, she is right!), but is too grateful for the shelter to investigate exactly *whose* room she is taking.  When she awakens the next morning, she finds a naked and amorous man in bed with her and her screaming protest brings them quite an audience.  Her bedmate turns out to be the Duke of Alvord, who offers her marriage since he has unwittingly compromised her.  She, of course, refuses his offer because he is young, handsome, charming, rich and titled and she is penniless and alone in a strange country with a ruined reputation and no references or employment.  (Ha!  No really, she has some other reasons for refusing his amazingly generous offer, but they make just about as much sense as that!)    James, the Duke of Alvord, is a really good hero--a gorgeous paragon really (except for his rakish reputation and the problem of his evil cousin Richard who keeps launching murder attempts against James in an effort to usurp the dukedom.) Sarah is an okay heroine but a bit inconsistent--by turns stunningly naive and improbably competent (has *no idea* how babies are made, but *does* know the basics of dirty street-fighting....)  James is crazy about her (although he spends more time fantasizing about getting her backinto his bed than he does talking to her.)  Richard, the evil cousin, is a pretty one-dimensional psychotic villain and insane rapist (no redeeming qualities *at all*!)  All the villains in the book are homosexuals or bisexuals (a not very PC move by the author.)    The plot moves along pretty well, but takes some dark turns (so be warned--Richard is *really* a bad guy!)  I found Sarah's repeated refusals of James's offers of marriage and insistence that she would look for employment to be ultimately annoying, and the details of James's sexual history (Sarah's real reason for rejecting his proposal is James's reputation as a rake) to be inconsistent with the rest of his behavior in the book.  The dialogue is generally witty, but with many, many modern phrases (except for Sarah's cousin Robbie, who seems to be the only one in the book talking \\"Regency-speak\\" like an escapee from a Georgette Heyer novel.)    In summary, this is a quick, enjoyable read with a really great hero and some very clever dialogue.    Recommended to Regency romance lovers, particularly to those who like a good bodice-ripping villain.	2005-03-23

For historical romance readers who grew up reading books by Daphne du Maurier and Victoria Holt, \\"The Mistress of Trevelyan\\" is a real treat in the same wonderful gothic tradition.  All the essential elements are present and accounted for--the impoverished governess, the dark, brooding (and oh-so-sexy) master of the house, the adorable (but damaged) motherless children, reams of on-location relatives (some openly hostile, some seemingly charming), and--of course--the snobby butler and dead wife's malevolent former nurse.      The story is set in San Francisco in 1873.  The heroine, Ann Lovell, despite being the illegitimate daughter of a laundress, has grown up well educated and secure in her mother's love.  Almost six feet in height, with threadbare clothes and work-roughened hands, Ann thinks of herself as \\"practical\\" but, in truth, has the soul of a romantic.  With no experience or credentials, she applies for a job as a governess at Trevelyan Hill, a mist-encased mansion that has fired her imagination since she was a child. Against all odds Benedict Trevelyan--the dark, wealthy, and mysterious master of the house gives her the job. Ann finds herself immediately drawn to both Benedict, a man rumored to have murdered his wife, and to his children, and before long becomes entangled in the mysteries and past tragedies of the family.  But someone is trying to frighten her away with threatening messages, ghostly apparitions and escalating violence...     Ann is a great heroine in the true gothic governess tradition--tall and not traditionally beautiful but full of spirit and passion.  Benedict is a fine hero in the classic gothic mold.  The plot kept me guessing until near the end, predominantly due to the surfeit of possible suspects.      In summary, this is an excellent historical romantic suspense novel with a wonderful gothic flavor and lots of sexual tension.  Highly recommended!	2005-03-13

The book is an enjoyable, well-written romance with an appealing heroine and unusual hero.      Beautiful Lady Regina Tremaine is the daughter of a duke and the toast of London society--having refused 11 offers of marriage in the years since her come-out, she is known as \\"La Belle Dame Sans Merci\\".  In truth, she has decided that she will never marry because of a secret that she hides even from her own family.  At the beginning of the story \\"Beauty\\" approaches \\"The Beast\\", Marcus North, Viscount Draker, traveling to his castle with a plea to allow her brother, the Duke of Foxmoor, to court Draker's young half-sister, Louisa.  Marcus has forbidden Foxmoor's courtship because the young duke is a close friend of Prinny, Marcus's estranged natural father.  He fears that the duke's interest in Louisa is motivated by the Prince's desire for access to Louisa and through her to Marcus himself.  A gruff, scarred, bearded and unpolished recluse who scorns London society, Draker is known as the \\"Dragon Viscount\\" and is notorious for having thrown the Prince of Wales and his own mother (the Prince's mistress) out of his home when he inherited.     Marcus finds himself surprisingly attracted to the elegant, lovely Lady Regina and agrees to let her brother court Louisa only if Regina will allow the Dragon Viscount to publicly court *her*.  To his surprise, Regina agrees to the bargain.  Regina is surprised to find herself attracted to the notorious Dragon Viscount and before long finds herself thinking some very unladylike thoughts about him.  As the courtships proceed, Regina begins to have her own doubts about her brother's intentions towards the innocent Louisa.    Regina is a good heroine--pretty spunky and genuinely good-hearted.  Her big secret  is revealed to the readeron page 40, so I am not sure that it is such a huge spoiler to discuss it (okay, I *won't*), but it *is* surprising and it does distinguish her from other romantic heroines (although Connie Brockway, Susan Wiggs and Judy Cuevas have all ventured into this area before.)      Marcus is a wonderfully unusual romantic hero.  Acknowledged by Prinny as one of his by-blows but accepted by his mother's scholarly husband, the Viscount Draker, as his own son and heir, Marcus has lived his life defending himself and his mother from taunts about his parentage and his mother's (lack of) virtue.  Wealthy and reclusive, Marcus is awkwardly large and pretty much lacks any courtly graces.  It is fun to watch Regina turn the \\"Beast\\" into a gentleman, and to watch Marcus teach Regina to believe in herself.    My quibbles with the book are minimal.  I cannot say that I like the salacious title or cover overly much, but perhaps I am in the minority there.  The use of the Blake painting of the Dragon and \\"the woman clothed in the sun\\" as a symbol for the hero and heroine rings some wrong notes for readers familiar with Thomas Harris's  \\"The Red Dragon\\" in which that picture figured prominently as an creepy icon for a serial killer.  The resolution of  Regina's big secret is handled a bit unrealistically and far too quickly.    In summary, this is an entertaining historical romance by Sabrina Jeffries.  An  excerpt from the next book in the Royal Brotherhood Series included at the end looks even better and I look forward to reading Gavin's story!	2005-03-08

Lucky me!  She has been lending me all of MB's short regencies for *my* reading pleasure!  \\"The Temporary Wife\\" is one of her favorites, and with good reason.  It is a wonderful little book--very well written and with a great heroine and touching story.    Anthony Earheart, the Marquess of Staunton, has been estranged from his family for eight years when he receives a message from his father, the Duke of Withingsby, summoning him home in order to formalize his betrothal to a very young, well-born girl of his father's choice.  In order to spite and embarass his father, the marquess decides to marry beneath himself to someone totally unsuitable.  As he describes the woman he is looking for to his friend, Lord Rowling:    \\"She must be a gentlewoman--I'll not go lower than that, you see.  She must also be impoverished, plain, demure, very ordinary, perhaps even prim.  She must have all the personality of a--a a quiet mouse.\\"    He places an advertisement in the paper for a governess, intending to select from the applicants the drabbest, mousiest one as his bride.  When he interviews the shabbily genteel, seemingly meek Miss Charity Duncan, the arrogant marquess thinks that he has found the perfect pawn for his scheme of revenge against his father.  He offers Charity a fortune to marry him and be his \\"temporary wife\\"--traveling to his family home to meet his family in order to prove that he is beyond his father's power and influence.  After a few weeks, Charity would be allowed to go her own way--a wealthy woman although still married to the marquess in name only.  Charity, the oldest of six children left deeply in debt following their father's death, finds Anthony's offer too good to refuse.    But Charity is not exactly the \\"little brown mouse\\" that she seems to be at the interview.  She is a wonderfully charming, warm-hearted woman who is *appalled* when she meets Anthony's unhappy, cold family and cannot help meddling to try to heal old family rifts.  She has a marvelous ability to *forgive* others, and her quiet dignity and grace put the top-lofty, grudge-bearing Earhearts to shame.     Anthony starts out as a pretty obnoxious, arrogant hero--but Mary Balogh gives him a wonderful heart and the later scenes with his estranged family members are truly touching.  Even the cold, seemingly heartless Duke of Withingsby is a fully-drawn character by the end of the story--imperfect but human.    In summary, this is a wonderful short regency by Mary Balogh--one of my favorites!    Highly recommended!	2005-02-28

Beautiful Samantha Newman was a naive 18 year old in her first London season when she fell in love with the fabulously handsome and equally devious Lionel, Viscount Kersey, who at the time was her cousin's fiance.  When she realized that Lionel had been cruelly toying with her affections, she was devastated.  Six years later, her life is still blighted by the relationship and she has never married or allowed herself to fall in love again.  While visiting her cousin's country estate, she goes for a walk and strays onto the neighboring estate of the Marquess of Carew.  There she meets a gentleman in shabby clothing who she mistakes for a landscaper and strikes up a friendship with him, not realizing that \\"Hartley Wade\\" is actually the reclusive Marquess of Carew.  Hartley is an average-looking guy who was partially crippled by a childhood accident--but his heart is pure gold.  He is charmed by Samantha's sweet nature and dazzled by her beauty, so when she returns to London, he follows her there.      In London, Samantha is appalled to learn that Lionel (now the Earl of Rushford) has returned to town after a six year exile on the continent.  Even more gorgeous (and snake-like) than ever, Lionel begins once again to stalk Samantha.  Can Samantha resist him this time and recognize the worth of the relatively plain Lord Carew??    In summary, this is a lovely little tale about friendship turning into love and discovering the inner beauty in a person.  Samantha's final scene with Lionel is a beauty in itself.

I don't actually read that much contemporary romance--but if it is all as much fun as \\"Ain't She Sweet\\", perhaps I should!  I *devoured* this book in less than a day and enjoyed every minute of it.    Sugar Beth Carey was the richest, most beautiful and *bitchiest* girl in her high school class in Parrish, Mississippi.  The homecoming queen who dated the most gorgeous guy in the class, Sugar Beth seemed to have everything anyone could possibly want.  She ruled even her friends with the iron hand of social intimidation and made life *hell on earth* for her enemies--most notably Winnie Davis, a shy, geeky classmate and Colin Byrne, a young teacher whose clash with Sugar Beth resulted in his dismissal for sexual misconduct.    Fifteen years and three marriages later, Sugar Beth returns home to Parrish broke and desperate, hoping to find a legacy left by her aunt that could solve her financial problems.  Her former victims are now wealthy, successful members of the Parrish community and thirsty for revenge against the girl who once callously rejected, humiliated or destroyed them.  But as they try to extract their vengenance, they slowly begin to realize that Sugar Beth is not the same girl that she was fifteen years ago.    I adored the character of Sugar Beth!  Kudos to Susan Elizabeth Phillips for taking such a truly negative character and giving her a heart and soul.  Although there is no excusing her really *bad* behavior as a teenager, it becomes clear that Sugar Beth's young life was not as perfect as it seemed and that she has had to do some serious growing up in the intervening fifteen years.  She was such a terror as a teenager that just about everyone in the town has some sort of grudge against her--many for reasons that she cannot even recall.  The scene where a humbled but not broken Sugar Beth is obliged to wait upon her malicious former classmates is wonderfully done.  The character of Colin Byrne, the disgraced teacher who has become a successful writer,is also excellent and his reasons for hating Sugar Beth are *very* valid, making his efforts to resist her attractions quite believable.       In summary, this is a very enjoyable contemporary romance with a strong, complex, very imperfect heroine and a fine hero.  The story line is fast and fun and the dialogue (especially between Sugar Beth and Colin) witty and spirited.  Oh, and I *loved* the quotes from Georgette Heyer novels at the beginning of each chapter!    Highly recommended!	2005-02-27

There is a really interesting story buried inside of \\"Indiscretion\\"--but it never has a chance to get out into the daylight.  Jillian Hunter, striving for a very light touch, packs the story with silly situations and \\"sit-com\\" style conversational zingers which, in my humble opinion, make the story less than it could be.  However, if that sort of story *is* your cup of tea, prepare to be entertained. <br /> <br />Anne Kerr was a beautiful, lonely and wild young girl when she met and was seduced by the handsome, reckless, devil-may-care Patrick Sutherland.  When Patrick goes off to join the infantry, a devastated Anne ends up marrying his cousin, David.  Seven years later, Anne (now a widow) and Patrick are brought together again by the order of Queen Victoria--supposedly to investigate the death of Patrick's uncle, Lord Kingairn, that occurred at a shooting party on Anne's estate one year previously.  Now this is a pretty flimsy set-up to bring the hero and heroine together, but the real lynchpin of the plot is that Patrick is to pose as Anne's butler during the investigation--supposedly so that he can question the servants more easily.   <br /> <br />I found the beginning of the book to be very heavy going--it took me *days* to get through the first 100 pages, and that for me is *forever*!  The investigation is arranged by the Queen and Patrick's eccentric Aunt Nellwyn while Anne constantly snipes away at Patrick and Patrick murmurs suggestive remarks into Anne's ear (very frequently they do both in front of other people!)  Then Patrick takes on the role of the butler and the book veers towards slapstick comedy.  He is one heck of a rude, irreverent butler and *some* of his remarks are witty--but not enough of them to sustain the farce (in my opinion). <br /> <br />Anne is an interesting character and one that should have inspired sympathy (ruined and abandoned by her thoughtless lover as a young girl); however, she is so very nasty and bitter almost throughout thebook that she is a little bit hard to like.  In contrast, Patrick, who should be censured for his less than honorable behavior in his youth, is a delightful character--repentant, charming and passionate--a viscount who is willing to masquerade as a butler in order to be close to Anne.  Frankly, I thought that the best parts of the book were the flashback scenes to Anne and Patrick's day of \\"indiscretion\\"--which had more passion and heart than the rest of the story. <br /> <br />In summary, this is a very light historical romance set in Victorian times with a minimal dusting of a murder mystery, a big streak of comedy and an engagingly imperfect hero.	2005-02-26

It is a lushly romantic story set in Victorian England with unusual and memorable lead characters.  For jaded historical romance readers who are bored with the boiler plate \\"plucky 18 year old virgin tames cynical 30-some year old rakehell\\" plotline, this story is a breath of fresh air. <br /> <br />Madeleine DuMais, a beautiful half-French/half-English spy working for Britian, arrives in the small town of Winter Garden with the assignment of investigating and exposing an opium smuggling ring in the area.  Her associate in the the investigation is Thomas Blackwood, a British spy who is posing as a scholar writing his memoirs of the Opium Wars. Living alone with Thomas in a small cottage, Madeleine is reportedly translating these memoirs into French.   <br /> <br />Madeleine is an excellent character.  The illegitimate daughter of an opium-addicted French actress, she has made a decent life for herself by virtue of her wits and her beauty.  She has had a series of lovers in her life--but has never allowed herself to fall in love.  (Her sexual history makes her a very unusual historical romance heroine, but would barely even register on the radar for the usual historical romance *hero*.  Ah!  Double standards!)   <br /> <br />Thomas is one awesome romantic hero--intelligent, passionate, intense, honorable and somewhat mysterious.  Tall, dark and handsome, he walks with a pronounced limp due to an injury from the Opium Wars.  He is obsessively in love with Madeleine and wants more from her than the brief affair she envisions.  It is a nice twist to see the hero holding out for true love for a change. <br /> <br />The pace of the story is relatively slow and the opium smuggling plotline seems to drift away at the end, because the spotlight is really on Madeleine and Thomas's developing love affair.  I found the character development in the story to be excellent.  Thomas is a man with secrets--some of which I guessed and some of which surprised me.  The sexual tension is intense and the sex scenes very passionate and sensual without being overdone. <br /> <br />In summary this is an excellent and unusual historical romance with complex, memorable characters and a wonderfully romantic story line.  Readers who enjoy character-driven romance and are tired of the usual \\"historical romance formula\\" will appreciate \\"Winter Garden\\". <br /> <br />Highly recommended!	2005-02-22
US	48354998	R2FFBBCBMWE6JV	0451169166	814964355	A Certain Magic	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Lovely Story!!!	This book is an absolute *treasure*--a beautifully written story about two friends who have been in love with each other for 14 years, but have hidden their true feelings from each other--each mistakenly thinking that the other feels only friendship.   <br /> <br />Alice Penhallow has loved Piers Westhaven since she was a skinny 14 year old with braids and he was a dashing, charming 21 year old, but Piers never showed any romantic interest in her, so she ended up marrying his best friend, the steady and dependable Web Penhallow.  Piers was secretly in love with Alice as well, but buried his feelings for her when his best friend declared his intention to marry Alice when she was of age.  Believing Web to be more worthy of the lovely, sweet Alice, Piers resigned himself to the role of the couple's best friend and married a feather-brained beauty soon after Web and Alice's wedding. <br /> <br />Years later, Alice and Piers, both now widowed, meet again in London when Alice comes to nurse her brother's children who have the measles.  Piers, now 36 years old, has unexpectedly become the heir to a barony and is looking around for a new wife.  Naturally, he seeks the advice of his best friend \\"Allie\\" in helping him to choose among the season's debutants.  But as the two spend more and more time together, their old feelings for each other become harder to deny and when Piers turns to Allie for comfort one evening, the friends cross the line and become lovers.  But things cannot be solved so easily (oh, no, no, no!), because Piers has inadvertently compromised one of the young debutants and is honor-bound to offer *her* marriage. <br /> <br />The characters in this story are wonderful.  Alice is refreshingly serene, kind and mature for a romantic heroine and Piers is delightful--hiding his breaking heart behind his witty, devil-may-care facade.  The dialogue between the two of them sparkles and the first love scene is incredibly poignant.  The beginning of the book moves slowly, but stick with the story--the middle part and the ending are so *very* wonderful and moving!   <br /> <br />Highly recommended!	2005-02-20

Mary Balogh is a *master* of the short Regency romance and \\"Snow Angel\\" is a wonderful example of just how *good* such a story can be.  Both the hero and heroine were imperfect but *vastly* likeable, the secondary characters were well-developed (one of them almost steals the book!), the story was well-written and wonderfully angsty (my favorite type!) and the sexual tension perfectly done.    Rosamund Hunter is a young widow, recently out of mourning for her much older husband.  Traveling with her overbearing elder brother Dennis, Rosamund gets into an argument with him about a new suitor who he is promoting and walks away from his carriage in a huff just before a major snowstorm hits the area. When Dennis is delayed by an accident, Rosamund finds herself walking alone in a blizzard.  Justin Halliday, the Earl of Wetherby, is traveling by in his carriage and sees her struggling in the cold; he offers her a ride and shelter from the storm.  Rosamund accepts before she realizes that she will be *alone* with the very handsome Justin at his friend's hunting box for the duration of the storm.      Rosamund and Justin, wildly attracted to each other and thrown together in an isolated place for three days, eventually agree to have a brief affair.  Rosamund's husband was a much older man and she is curious about passion with a younger man.  Justin makes it clear from the onset that he is planning to get engaged in one more month (an arranged marriage) and he intends to be faithful to his betrothed--so their affair has no future.  They share three magical days and then separate as the snow begins to melt to go on with their former lives.      Despite their best efforts, Justin and Rosamund find that they are unable to forget each other.  They meet again by chance under the most awkward of circumstances (the houseparty to celebrate Justin's upcoming engagement) and try to deny their mutual attraction and avoid each other. But fate keeps throwing them together and they are unable to resist each other's company.    I loved the characters of both the hero and heroine--wonderful, but flawed people who give in to an irresistible impulse to become lovers and later find themselves struggling to act honorably and deny their seemingly impossible love.  The secondary characters are also marvelously three-dimensional--especially Joshua and Annabelle, but even Rosamund's prosy suitor is given a heart.  (In fact, Joshua is *such* a great character that he almost steals the book from Justin.)    My only complaint with this book is the same one that I had with Mary Balogh's \\"Tempting Harriet\\" (also a wonderful book!)--the hero throughout the book doggedly continues his courtship of the very eligible and unenthusiatic girl of his *mother's* dreams, while secretly eating his heart out over the heroine.  His courtship goes past the point where he can honorably back out--so the happy ending depends on the bold action of others.  I find this passive road to a happy end a little less than satisfying, but this is a minor quibble since the rest of the book is so good.    In summary, this is an excellent short Regency by Mary Balogh with a lively, attractive heroine and hero.      Highly recommended!	2005-02-17
US	48354998	R3U3P7WP56PON0	0671795538	936532040	Perfect (The Paradise series)	Books	4	21	23	N	N	Romatic Pageturner with a Heroine who is a bit *too* Perfect	I have read and enjoyed *all* of Judith McNaught's historical romances (my true passion), so I decided to try one of her contemporary romances for a change.  \\"Perfect\\" is a great story--a real page-turner with a complex, dark and sexy hero.    Zachary Benedict, a gorgeous self-made man with a mysterious past, is a phenomenally successful Hollywood movie star and director until his adulterous actress wife is murdered on the set of the film he is directing and he is convicted of her murder and sent to prison for 43 years.  He escapes from prison 5 years later (with the help of some *amazingly* lax prison security) and in his flight takes Julie Matheson, an innocent schoolteacher, as his hostage to a mountain hideaway in Colorado.  Although Zach initially plots cynically to seduce Julie to bind her to him, he finds himself genuinely drawn to her warmth and spirit.  Julie is appalled to find herself attracted to her captor and desperately tries to escape (well, at least initially...)    Zach is a great hero--strong but damaged by his past, sexy and gorgeous but remote, cynical but with the heart of a romantic.  He is the engine that keeps the story running, in my opinion.      Julie is a pretty good heroine, but (in my opinion) the \\"goody-two-shoes\\" stuff is a bit overdone.  Abandoned by her mother at birth, she is a rebellious and unwanted foster child prior to being adopted by the Mathesons when she was 11 years old.  Overwhelmed by their love and trust, she vows to be worthy of it by being \\"perfect\\".  And, boy oh boy!, is she ever *perfect*!  A minister's daughter and teacher who works with handicapped kids, an adult literacy volunteer and activist, a 26 year old virgin who has actively avoided dating sexy men, Julie is *beloved* in her small Texas town.  Unfortunately, all this perfection is a little bit cloying.  I liked more the fact that she was genuinely a *kind* person--she gives Zach a ride initially because she feels sorry for him.  As his captive, Julie intially tries to escape, then to gull Zach into complacency.  There is a little too much adorable woman-child behavior by Julie for my taste, but Zach eats it right up. He is a *little* bit suspicious when she wants to build a snowman in subzero weather, but (gosh, darn it!) isn't she cute!  Of course, three days with Zach and Julie's 26 years of virginity are down the drain (talk about the Stockholm syndrome!)     The plot is interesting and moves along well, although there is the \\"trademark\\" Judith McNaught *major hiccup* in trust between the main characters that is later brushed off and forgiven.  Although this plot event introduces all sorts of tension and turmoil into the story--I have to say that I thought that it was out of character, had potentially disasterous results and was almost *unforgivable*.  My other major complaint with the story was with all the Hollywood name-dropping.  I found it annoying and out of character for Julie and especially Zach to be so star-struck.     This is a longish book (over 600 pages) but I finished it in one day.  The story is entertaining and Zach is the kind of dark, driven, sexy and complex hero that I adore.  I love to see the strong, cynical type brought to his knees by his love for a good woman!  Recommended!	2005-02-13

Jo Beverley is a prolific writer and I have read *a lot* of her books; I think that \\"A Most Unsuitable Man\\" is perhaps my favorite.  This story is an off-shoot of the Georgian period Malloren series (although other Malloren family members are in this book, everyone except for Rothgar is just wallpaper.)  I *loved* both the hero and the heroine in this book and the plot was definitely a page-turner.    Damaris Myddleton is the daughter of a wealthy merchant who was \\"little better than a pirate\\" and an heiress with a mission--to marry as high up in the aristocracy as her vast fortune will allow.  After single-mindedly pursuing the cash-strapped Marquess of Ashart, she suffers the humiliation of having Ashart publicly announce his betrothal to his aunt's beautiful but impoverished companion, Genova Smith, at the Malloren family Christmas celebration.  To hide her shame, Damaris tries to flee Rothgar Abbey only to be stopped in her foolish flight by Ashart's friend, Octavius Fitzroger.  Fitzroger is a handsome, penniless adventurer with a scandalous past--\\"most unsuitable\\" husband material but sooooo attractive and supportive that Damaris finds herself drawn to him.      Fitzroger is a first-class hero--honorable, intelligent, brave, and gorgeous.  Only barely tolerated in society because of a *very* scandalous incident in his youth, Fitz is a loyal friend to Ashart and is secretly acting as his bodyguard.  Damaris is not your run-of-the-mill heroine. An unabashed social climber who has had her lawyers draw up dossiers on eligible, impoverished peers, she goes after what she wants with impressive single-mindedness.  When Fitzroger surprises her with a kiss, she surprises him right back by pushing him down and kissing him *very* thoroughly.  She is a smart, passionate, determined young lady and I liked her alot.  Charmingly, Damaris and Fitz are attracted to qualities in each other that other people tend to overlook or find unattractive.    The story moves along well with sub-plots of attempted murders and undisclosed royal marriages, but the book is truly about Damaris coming to realize that what she really should use her fortune to pursue is her own heart's desire.    In summary, this is an exceptionally good Georgian period romance with a compelling hero and heroine.  I usually don't like pictures of the hero on the cover of my books (because they are nearly always so very cheesy), but I have to admit the cover model on this one is a hottie.      Highly recommended.	2005-02-10

The hero of the story is the gothically handsome and forbidding Captain Sebastian Alexander, naval hero of the Napoleonic wars and younger son of the Earl of Tiern-Cope.  Sebastian was born a third son or \\"spare\\" but finds himself inheriting following the deaths of his older brothers.  At home recuperating from a war wound, he intends to \\"do his duty\\" to the earldom -- marry and set up his nursery prior to returning to the sea.  His friend, James, arranges a houseparty at Pennhyll Castle to introduce Sebastian to likely young ladies--including James's half-sister, the beautiful and spoiled Diana. <br />Also included among the guests is the heroine, Miss Olivia Willow, an impoverished former governess who was present on the fateful night one year previously when Sebastian's brother and sister-in-law were murdered and Olivia herself gravely injured.  Olivia claims to have no memory of the night, but Sebastian has his doubts about that and wants to question her himself. <br /> <br />Olivia is an excellent heroine--intelligent, honorable, hard-working and unaffected.  Her poverty is dealt with in a very touching manner and her choices are brave and appropriate.  I am not quite sure why she went to such pains to appear to be a silly flibbertigibbet at the beginning of the book (weren't most of the other houseguests local people and wouldn't they have known her already?), but once she set that act aside she proved to be a very appealing heroine. <br />   <br />Sebastian was an interesting and compelling hero.  A naval officer who has been largely at sea for the past 12 years, he lacks social graces and makes no apologies to anyone.  (The fact that he is handsome, titled and wealthy help everyone overlook his rough edges.)  After coldly deciding that Diana would make a perfect countess, he finds himself perversely attracted to the flame-haired Olivia and drawn into the mystery of her past and herrelationship with his older brother.  Further complicating the picture is the castle ghost (the Black Earl)--visible only to Sebastian and Olivia--who seems to be pushing them together. <br /> <br />I *loved* the gothic and paranormal elements in this book--particularly the sequences where it was hard to know what was real and what was fantasy.  The sexual tension was wonderfully done and the characters of the hero and heroine well developed.  My major quibble with the story is that the murder mystery wrap-up was rather anti-climactic and the ending seemed to be a bit mundane compared to the very unusual and original middle section of the book.   <br /> <br />In summary, this is a very well-written, unusual historical romance with lovely gothic touches and an appealing hero and heroine.   <br /> <br />Highly recommended for historical romance lovers looking for something a little bit different!	2005-02-09

I say that because I did *not* (I read the third entry, \\"Veils of Silk\\", first.)  Much of the plotline of \\"Silk and Secrets\\" is discussed in the final book, so the plot twists were really no surprise to me and this detracted slightly from my enjoyment of the story.      Lord Ross Carlisle (now the Marquess of Kilburn), the hero of \\"Silk and Secrets\\", was introduced in the first book of the trilogy (\\"Silk and Shadows\\") as Mikahl's best friend and Lady Sara's cousin.  The younger son of a duke who has traveled extensively and written about his adventures, Ross is the epitome of upper-crust British manners and sangfroid.  He is also fabulously handsome, intelligent, loyal, brave and amazingly even-tempered (in a word, pretty darn *perfect*.) At age 21, Ross had married the wild, unconventional 17 year old Scottish beauty, Juliet Cameron, against almost everyone's advice and six months later she abandoned him for reasons that Ross still does not understand.      After not seeing his wife for 12 years, Ross is reunited with her (ahem, by *chance*) in Persia when he is sent by her mother to discover the fate of Juliet's brother, Ian, a British army officer who has disappeared in Bokhara and is rumored to have been executed as a spy.  Juliet is a great heroine--brave, adventurous, passionate and flawed.  She is living in Persia in true Lady Hester Stanhope style--as the leader of a small fortress community.  Juliet convinces Ross to take her along to find Ian and the two travel the Silk Road in disguise with a caravan to Bokhara.  The dangerous trip is complicated by Ross and Juliet's simmering attraction to each other, Ross's feelings of anger and hurt over Juliet's past faithlessness and Juliet's crushing guilt over her past behavior.     Mary Jo Putney does an excellent job of developing the characters of Ross and Juliet--strong, adventurous,passionate people who are still beset by insecurities and whose imperfections make them more realistic.  I have to say that I loved the fact that Ross had never gotten over Juliet in *12 years*--that's true love!  The story is jam-packed with adventure, although I could have done without having every event described through first Ross then Juliet's point-of-view.  I enjoyed the unusual setting and, as usual, MJP fills the story with rich historical detail in a way that is mostly unobtrusive.    In summary, this is a very well-written historical romance with an exotic setting, a wonderful hero who is truly a *great guy* and a strong, unique heroine.      Highly recommended!	2005-02-08

Although the plot was far-fetched and a little ridiculous (but, hey!, this is a romance novel!), the characters were well developed and the writing style light and witty.    The heroine of \\"Nobody's Baby But Mine\\" is Dr. Jane Darlington, a lonely physics nerd who has just passed her 34th birthday, and--boy!--is her biological clock ticking!  Deciding to have a baby and believing that her own miserable childhood was due to her genius level IQ, she wants a healthy and relatively dumb father for her child.  Her reasoning is that the baby then would end up with a more normal IQ due to \\"tendency toward the mean\\"--(this being probably the most ridiculous part of the book, but necessary for the plot to move forward.)  Jane picks out Cal Bonner, hunky football quarterback of the Chicago Stars, after seeing him on TV responding to an interviewer in his \\"good ol' boy\\" Southern drawl (hmmmm, obviously a moron.)  But Cal is far from the dumb jock that he appears to be, as Jane finds out when he discovers her scheme.    Cal was a pretty great character--gorgeous, sexy, smart, and honorable, but also commitment-phobic and so insecure about his impending middle-age (in a young man's profession) that he never dates any woman over 23 years old.  Jane is a pretty good heroine despite her intellectual arrogance and rather unscrupulous initial behavior--an intelligent, witty and lonely woman who is looking for someone to love.  The secondary characters are well done as well--particularly Cal's parents and Kevin, the young, cocky second-string quarterback who wants Cal's job.         The plot is improbable but moves along pretty well, and some of the scenes are *very* funny indeed.  I particularly liked the initial seduction scene with an inept Jane posing as an call girl and doing calisthenics to \\"The Flight of the Bumblebee\\" when a suspicious Cal asks her to dance for him.  That (and the rest ofthat scene) are worth the price of the book.    In summary, this is a sexy, humorous romance with a really dreamy/hunky hero and an unusual plotline.    Recommended!	2005-02-01

In the first book, Darius is introduced as a beautiful but damaged child of 14 years old, resourceful beyond his years and unable to trust anyone but Prince Lazar and Allegra, whose lives he saves by aiding an escape from a sadistic Barbary slave-owner.  (Interestingly, this episode is never mentioned directly in the second story.)  \\"Princess\\" is set 20 years after the first book and Darius, raised as a ward of Prince Lazar, is now the chief spy and assassin of Ascencion (the fictional island off the coast of Italy where the stories are set.)      The princess of the title is Lazar and Allegra's first born daughter, the stunningly beautiful Princess Serafina, who has been nursing a crush on Darius, her former bodyguard, since she was 4 years old.  Secretly madly in love with her too, Darius holds himself aloof as he realizes that a marriage between a princess and a illegitimate, half-Gypsy gutter-rat is an impossibility, particularly when Napoleon is eyeing the island's navy and Serafina's marriage could have major political consequences.    Darius is a wonderful, dark, *dark* hero--gorgeous, loyal to Lazar, ruthless with his enemies and wonderfully gentle with Serafina.  Ashamed of his past, he feels unworthy of the lovely, pure princess.  He has a heck of a reputation with the ladies of Ascencion, but never has felt truly accepted by anyone except Serafina.  Serafina herself is a bit of a disappointment as a heroine.  She is a typical high maintenance, tantrum-throwing beauty--all tossing inky curls, pouting cherry lips and stamping little feet.  Her moods are wildly labile and she can be a manipulative little so-and-so.  Kidnappers and killers are lurking, the kingdom is in dire peril, and she wants Darius (the king's right-hand man) to loosen up, take a vacation and fly some kites.  In a word, she is *childish* (this is Allegra and Lazar's daughter?????)  But she is not without redeeming qualities--I did like her spunk, bravery and unwavering loyalty to Darius.      The plot starts out with a bang--a foiled kidnapping attempt on Serafina--and moves along pretty well.  Things heat up when Serafina and Darius move to a safe house for her protection and are left to their own devices (kite-flying and much, MUCH more!)  As usual for Gaelen Foley, the writing is good, the dialogue is littered with distracting modern phrases and idioms and the sex scenes are smokin' hot.  Surprisingly, Lazar and Allegra turn out to be losers as parents, although they are still mad for each other.      In summary, this is an very entertaining story of forbidden love with a wonderful *damaged* hero.  Highly recommended!	2005-01-30

Looking over the reviews, \\"Bet Me\\" seems to be a book that you either love or hate.  Personally, I thought that parts of the book were worthy of *10 stars*, but I *love* romantic fiction and am not looking for realism in a book like this one.  Jennifer Crusie is *excellent* at adapting the fairy tale into a contemporary romance.  I loved the characters of Minerva and Calvin--an insecure, chubby Cinderella with a sharp wit and her gorgeous, commitment-phobic Prince Charming.    Minerva Dobbs has just been dumped in the middle of a theme bar by her handsome boyfriend of 3 months because she will not sleep with him.  She is more upset about losing her date to her sister's upcoming wedding than losing David (the boyfriend), but she is feeling pretty down on herself and on men in general.  Her friends try to distract her with a gorgeous guy (Calvin Morrisey) standing across the bar from her, talking to David.  When her friends goad her into approaching the hunk, Minerva overhears David betting Calvin that he cannot get her to sleep with him in the next month.  Minerva thinks that she has heard Cal agree to the bet and starts fuming.  When Calvin approaches her to ask her to dinner, an angry Minerva agrees, thinking that she will string him along until after her sister's wedding and then dump him.  Cal cannot understand why all his legendary charm falls flat with a very prickly Minerva, and Minerva cannot understand why she finds Cal so attractive, despite all that she knows about him.    I loved the character of Minerva, a curvy girl on a low carb diet in a world full of skinny Minnies.  Her insecurities were very real (but I agree with Cal, all that talk about not eating food was pretty boring.)  Calvin was a wonderful literary creation--a gorgeous, charming, \\"love 'em and leave 'em\\" type who gets blindsided by his deep attraction to Minerva.  So *unlikely*, I know, but that is what makes romantic fiction *great*!  They both have awful families, intrusive friends, meddling ex's and some real insecurity issues.     The dialogue was snappy and very witty and the plot quite clever.  I loved the slightly mystical touches (minor accidents befall the H/H when they deny their love to others) and the fairy tale references in the plot (a shoe is lost, a \\"wolf\\" approaches a woman in a red hooded sweater, a kiss \\"awakens\\" a sleeper) that underscored that Cal and Min were \\"meant to be\\".  Food was used as a metaphor and plot device a bit *too* much for my taste (ha!)--enough already about Chicken Marsala, donuts, bread and butter! I admit that I did love the scene in which Cal seduces a kiss out of Min on a picnic table with the help of a Krispy Kreme donut (the donut acting as a metaphor for the kiss itself--both forbidden *bliss* for Min!)  My other quibble with the book was with the epilogue.  Min complains near the end of the book that nobody ever writes stories about happily ever after--and she is right.  While everyone agrees that the heroine should get the handsome prince at the end of a good romance, \\"happily ever after\\" means different things to different people and is best left to the reader's imagination (I think anyways...)     In summary, \\"Bet Me\\" is a sexy, light, humorous romp with an engaging hero and heroine.  I think that Jennifer Crusie is a *wonderfully* talented author and would also recommend \\"Welcome to Temptation\\" (a book by JC that I liked even more!)	2005-01-29

Historical romance readers who love damaged heroes and angsty romance will adore \\"Silk and Shadows\\".    Mikahl Khanauri has been coldly plotting his revenge against Charles Weldon for 25 years and it is finally within his grasp.  A wealthy, exotic and mysterious man who goes by the name of Prince Peregrine of Kafiristan, Mikahl arrives in Victorian England from Asia and sets in motion his plan to destroy his enemy--financially, socially and physically.  Part of the plan involves separating Weldon from his wealthy, high-born fiancee, Lady Sara St. James.  Peregrine sets out to charm and compromise the lovely Lady Sara, and finds himself unexpectedly drawn to her honesty and quiet strength.  Sara is dangerously attracted to the exciting and mysterious Peregrine....but who is he really and why is he out for vengeance against Weldon???    The characters of the hero and heroine, Mikahl and Sara, are *very* well drawn and complement each other so very well.  Mikahl is a complex, multi-layered and wonderfully *flawed* hero (my favorite type!)  Sara is an excellent heroine--mature, intelligent, kind-hearted, passionate and true to her ideals.  The villain of the piece, Weldon, is perhaps a bit too outrageously villainous (a seriously bad man and cold-hearted hypocrite with really *no* redeeming qualities except for his affection for his daughter.)   There are a host of well-drawn secondary characters and even a touching secondary romance.    Typically for a Mary Jo Putney book, some of the issues dealt with in the story (child prostitution, slavery and rape--to name a few) are *very* serious stuff and will not please readers who are looking for a light, fluffy romance.  But for those who like their heroes dark and damaged (and in need of redemption), this is an excellent read--well-written, well-plotted with memorable characters.    Highly recommended!	2005-01-28

This book is what people are talking about when they say \\"a Regency romp!\\"  Jessica Benson has penned an *amazingly* good first novel with \\"Lord Stanhope's Proposal\\".  The writing is excellent, the characters delightful and the plot an intricately woven comedy of manners (and errors!)  The book reads like a cross between Georgette Heyer and Julia Quinn--and I mean that as high praise!    The heroine of the story, Miss Calista Ashton, is a 24 year old spinster and blue-stocking with a sharp wit, good heart and terrible clothes sense.  She is the sister of a brandy-swilling vicar in a small village. When the Hon. Oswald Cravanndish (Ossie) is ordered by his formidable mother to rusticate and find a suitable bride (following an ignominious dive into Sally Jersey's punchbowl), he and his equally frivolous friends, Nev and Squibby, cook up a plan to travel to their friend, Elmo Lyttworth's, village and pretend to court the village spinster (Calista).  Unfortunately, this plan is accompanied by bets being placed in the books at their club regarding the odds of Ossie's courtship meeting with success.  Recognizing that his foolish cousin has endangered the reputation of an innocent lady, Tristan Rutherford-Hayes, Lord Stanhope, travels to the village as well in an attempt to defuse the situation and rescue the lady's reputation.  And that is only the beginning of an extremely complicated and amusing plot....    Tristan, the Earl of Stanhope, is a marvelous hero--jaw-droppingly handsome, fabulously wealthy, intelligent, charming, honorable and sexy.  Bored with his string of vacuous mistresses and empty-headed society debutantes, he is challenged by Calista's wit and charmed by her lack of artifice.  Calista, for her part, cannot believe that such a gorgeous paragon would really be interested in her. But the two are seldom left to ponder their blossoming love in peace, as alternative suitors and interfering chaperones pop in and out of the story at a delicious pace.    The story does follow the plot of Georgette Heyer's \\"The Nonesuch\\" in general terms--a Corinthian, a paragon of society, and a confirmed bachelor, visits a small provincial village (that goes ga-ga over having such an august presence in their midst!) and ends up falling in love with the local spinster.  Tristan is even referred to as \\"the Nonesuch\\" in this story and some of the dialogue is pure Heyer. To my mind, Jessica Benson has *improved* on the story since I always have thought that the hero and heroine in \\"The Nonesuch\\" were rather bland and uninteresting (and Tristan and Calista are definitely not that!)  The secondary characters in \\"Lord Stanhope's Proposal\\" are also wonderfully well-drawn (although there is no one character to equal the pure brilliance of \\"The Nonesuch\\"'s beautiful, self-absorbed schemer, Tiffany Wield!)       In summary, this is a charming, delightful romance that lovers of the Regency sub-genre should *adore*.    Highly recommended!	2005-01-26

When the dazzlingly handsome, charming and wealthy Earl of Rutherford comes to look over Jessica's pupil as a potential wife, he is unimpressed with the girl herself, but the governess catches his eye.  Being a typical upperclass rakish cad, Rutherford makes an unwelcome pass at Jessica and unwittingly gets her dismissed without a reference.  Realizing that she will have trouble finding other employment, he then offers her the position of his mistress.  Jessica is a virtuous girl, but the Earl is gorgeous, and she is tempted.... <br /> <br />My main problem with the story was with the heroine, Jessica.  This is a girl who will cut off her nose to spite her face.  Jessica's options, it becomes clear later in the story, are not really as limited as we have been led to believe.  In light of her true background, her decisions regarding employment and the Earl of Rutherford's offers seem very strange and rather hard to believe.  She is also inconsistent--in some situations full of destructive, unbending pride and in others acting like a meek little mouse. <br />   <br />Rutherford is a better character--high-handed, arrogant and spoiled, but ultimately a nice guy who is willing to sacrifice his own happiness for Jessica's.  His sister, Hope, was also a great character. <br /> <br />In summary, this a good (but not great) Regency romance--limited primarily by its rather frustrating heroine.  It is a quick, pleasant read, but Mary Balogh has written a *multitude* of books that are far, far better than this one.   <br />	2005-01-24

This book cost me a forture because it is out of print, but it was well worth the money!  The story is great and the writing is superb.    The heroine, Jennifer Winward, is a young country miss in London for her first season.  She has been informally engaged to the very handsome and elegant Viscount Kersey for five years and is madly in love with him, although in truth she barely knows him.  With her formal engagement and wedding looming up over the next two months, she is disturbed to find herself the target of the attentions of the intensely attractive and disreputable Earl of Thornhill, Gabriel Fisher, a man who has been in exile on the Continent for the past two years--having fled there with his pregnant step-mother following a scandalous liason.    What Jennifer does not realize is that she is a pawn in a ruthless game of revenge that will leave her reputation in shambles.    The characters in this story are great, both the main characters and the villain.  Jennifer is a sweet and romantic girl--intelligent but too innocent to recognize the traps being set for her by the men.  Gabriel is a wonderful, conflicted and imperfect hero; an honorable man who temporarily puts his honor aside in his quest for revenge. (He does a very necessary world-class grovel at the end.)  Lionel (Viscount Kersey) is a wonderfully slimey and attractive villain.  The final confrontation scene between Gabriel and Lionel is priceless.   A great story!  I loved it!	2005-01-20

I really love it when a historical romance author can break the \\"rules\\" of the genre and make it work, and Mary Balogh definitely does that with \\"A Secret Pearl\\".  This is a great book (a read-all-night, can't-put-the-!#*&@-book-down-to-feed-the-kids type of book).      The hero of the book is Adam, the Duke of Raybourne, a veteran of Waterloo and a man who is scarred both physically and emotionally. Exiting the theater one evening, he notices a quiet, pathetic-looking prostitute and impulsively engages her for the night--not realizing that this is her first night on the job.  Unaware of her inexperience, unnerved by her silence and angry at himself for hiring a prostitute, Adam treats Fleur roughly and ends up hurting her.  When he realizes that she is a gentlewoman who has been driven to prostitution by poverty and desperation, he initially feeds her and overpays her and then later sends his secretary to find her and offer her a job as his young daughter's governess.    Fleur is thrilled to get the job until she realizes the her employer is the man who once treated her so callously and still haunts her nightmares.  She is worried that he has only brought her down to his estate to make her his mistress and is horrified at the prospect.    It takes a very bold and talented author to create a physically scarred, *married* hero and a heroine who begins as a prostitute and to make the reader care about them so deeply.  Instead of the philandering creep that he initially appears to be, Adam is almost *too* honorable and self-sacrificing--a man living as well as he is able with the broken dreams of his youth, and Fleur is a courageous but vulnerable heroine.  The characters of both Adam and Fleur are complex, well-drawn and believable and their unlikely romance is beautifully developed and truly *romantic*.  Some of the secondary characters are well-drawn as well, especially Adam's daughter and his valet.  In contrast, the villains of the story are a bit more one-note.Adam's wife, Sybil, is portrayed as a selfish, shockingly ungrateful b****, Adam's brother is an amoral cad and Fleur's nemesis, her cousin, is an obsessed lecher.  As usual for a Mary Balogh book, the story is very well-written with never a false note in the plot or dialogue (except perhaps Adam's seemingly endless patience with his incredibly annoying wife!)     This is angsty romance at its best and a must-read for anyone who loves Mary Balogh.  \\"A Secret Pearl\\" is a romance novel, so I was pretty sure that it was going to have a happy end, but I found myself fretting anyways as the final pages spun out.  *Very* highly recommended!	2005-01-18

This is a sweeping tale of adventure and betrayal set in the 1780's on the (fictional) island kingdom of Ascencion--off the coast of Genoa, Italy, and on the high seas.  I think that Gaelen Foley is a very talented writer, although at times her work is a bit uneven.  I found the plot and setting of this story to be both unusual and engaging and the characters are well-drawn. <br />   <br />At 13 years of age, Prince Lazar di Fiore had miraculously escaped during the slaughter of his entire family by his father's political enemies by jumping off a 200 foot high cliff.  Fifteen years later, Lazar, now the captain of a pirate ship, returns to Ascencion to exact his revenge upon his father's betrayer--Ottavio Monteverdi, the current Governor of Ascencion--and all of the Monteverdi family.  But when Allegra Monteverdi, the Governor's lovely daughter, pleads with Lazar for the lives of her family and offers herself in return for his mercy, he relents and sails away with Allegra as his captive.   <br /> <br />Lazar is a first-rate tortured hero.  He feels guilty, guilty, guilty! about running away and surviving while the rest of his family was murdered.  After his escape, he was pulled from the sea by Barbary corsairs who promptly sold him into two years of dehumanizing slavery with a sadistic master; then he escaped with the help of a cruel pirate captain into his life of piracy. Since everyone he has ever loved has died (even his dog got washed overboard!), Lazar believes himself to be cursed and avoids getting close to people.  He feels unworthy of his birthright--the Kingdom of Ascencion. <br /> <br />Allegra is a good (but long-suffering) heroine.  She has a very strong social conscience and is even willing to marry someone that she doesn't love for the good of the citizens of Ascencion.  When she realizes that her pirate captor is really the lost Prince Lazar, she shames and bullies him into facing up to his responsibilities to his kingdom. She is a pretty plucky heroine and I liked her.  <br /> <br />The plot is exciting and moves along for the most part.  There is the usual \\"sexual tension on the pirate vessel\\" plotline (Will he be able to overcome her moral scruples with his practiced seduction????  Of course!!!  But when?????)  At one point a weary and confused Allegra asks, \\"Why don't you just rape me and get it over with?\\"  Lazar tells her that he would never do that \\"Because I know how it feels.\\"  A good answer and good reason for the consumation of their relationship to be so drawn out, I think.  The eventual love scenes are *very* steamy--a Gaelen Foley specialty it seems. <br /> <br />I have a few quibbles with the book: <br />The writing is generally very good, although I find the use of modern slang expressions to be very jarring in a historical romance (the characters say things like \\"Have at you\\", \\"Hello there, beautiful.\\"  and \\"Huh?\\")  The public displays of affection in the book would have been scandalous in the time period of its setting.  The secondary characters are mostly underdeveloped (with the exception of Darius) and the villains are flat.  The love between Lazar and Allegra is very beautifully developed, but Lazar's treatment of the heroine is not always first rate (to put it mildly) and I am not sure that he did enough of a grovel at the end to warrant forgiveness.   <br /> <br />In summary, this is a well-written historical romance with an unusual setting and engaging characters.  <br />Recommended to historical romances lovers, especially those who like high adventure tales with tortured heroes.	2005-01-17

This is the kind of book that I was sorry to see end, even after over 550 pages!  \\"The Blood of Roses\\" is the sequel to Marsha Canham's excellent \\"The Pride of Lions\\" and is every bit as good as the first book.  Set during the 1745 Jacobite uprising, it continues the story of the valiant Scottish warrior, Alexander Cameron, and his passionate English bride, Catherine Ashbrooke Cameron.  I would strongly recommend reading \\"The Pride of Lions\\" first, and having \\"The Blood of Roses\\" on hand to begin *immediately* after the first book is finished in order to avoid groans and gnashing of one's teeth at the \\"end\\" of \\"The Pride of Lions\\".    Fans of the \\"Outlander\\" series of books should lap these stories up since the books are similar in setting, deft characterization, thrilling, nonstop action and careful attention to historical detail.  It should be noted that these books were actually written *before* \\"Outlander\\", so they are in no way derivative.    I loved the character of Catherine even in \\"The Pride of Lions\\" when she was a spoiled, selfish, pampered little princess.  So many heroines are given this same initial \\"Scarlett O'Hara\\" personality, but fail to engage me because that is *all* that there is to them.  Catherine (like Scarlett herself) has a core of pure steel beneath her ribbons and paniers. She is every bit as tough as Alexander and is worthy of his love.  In \\"The Blood of Roses\\", she has matured into a wonderful heroine--passionate, loyal, and madly in love with Alexander.      Alexander is a *great* hero--a soldier of fortune and Jacobite spy who had sworn never to remarry after the murder of his teenage bride, he returns to England after fifteen years of exile on the Continent at the beginning of \\"The Pride of Lions\\", still a wanted man accused of murdering the men who were responsible for his first wife's death.  He and Catherine are forced to marry following a scandalous duel, and initially they both seek to escape the union and to annul it.  But thatstory is told in \\"The Pride of Lions\\"...      \\"The Blood of Roses\\" picks up where the first story ended--Alexander and Catherine are well and truly married and in love (but separated--how frustrating!)  The Jacobite army is on the march with the Camerons leading the charges and an angry and mutinous Catherine has been sent home to Derby for her protection to wait out the war (HA! As if *that* will happen!)  The beginning of the book moved a bit slowly for my taste.  There is alot of exposition to rehash the events of \\"The Pride of Lions\\", much commenting on how much Catherine is missing Alexander and a long description of the battle of Prestonpans (an excellent description of a thrilling battle--but a very *familiar* battle, the details of which are well known  to anyone who has read the \\"Outlander\\" series and/or any other books about the Jacobite rebellion of 1745.)  Don't get me wrong, I really liked all the historical detail and descriptions of real historical figures included in this book--it adds immeasurably to the richness of the tale, but our hero and heroine were separated for too darn long at the beginning of the story.  Once they are reunited, the nonstop action (swordfights! battles! assaults! betrayals! black-hearted villains!) and steamy love scenes sweep the reader along to the bittersweet conclusion.      This is historical romance as I love it best--a well-plotted, exciting tale of passion and adventure with memorable characters and a healthy dose of historical detail.  A five star read!    Highly, highly recommended!	2005-01-15

It actually made me cry and that is really saying something because I *never* cry over books or movies.  Bravo to Mary Balogh for being brave enough to write a story set in Regency times with a *working* prostitute for a heroine!  I confess that I hate the more typical prostitute-but-still-a-virgin historical romance plotline.    Priscilla Wentworth is an impoverished gentlewoman who has been working in an uppercrust brothel for two months when she first meets the hero, Sir Gerald Stapleton, as one of her clients. Priscilla is a beautiful literary creation--a woman who is able to make lemonade out of the lemons that life has dealt her. She is a strong, intelligent, very sweet woman who has managed to retain her sense of self and dignity despite her sordid profession.  Gerald is a less heroic but still incredibly sympathetic character.  Not very adventurous, average in looks and intelligence, and feeling betrayed by all the important women in his life, he deliberately avoids any meaningful relationships with women until he meets Prissy.  She is so sweet, warm and accommodating that he finds himself drawn to her and eventually sets her up as his mistress. Both Gerald and Prissy are so afraid of getting hurt that they deny their growing affection and try to treat their relationship as a business arrangement.    The love that develops between Gerald and Prissy is very believable, as are the issues that keep them apart.  Gerald feels inadequate and cannot bring himself to trust any woman's love, particularly one like Prissy who has been trained to please and deceive men.  Prissy realizes that even if Gerald could ever bring himself to trust and commit--gentlemen do *not* marry women who have been prostitutes (especially known prostitutes with other clients who are members of his own social circle.)    In summary, this is a really unique and heart-wrenching story!  Highly recommended!	2005-01-12
US	48354998	RCXZD8J6LG1FL	0425200132	44695369	Night of Sin	Books	5	7	7	N	N	An Elegantly-written,  Sophisticated Romance	Julia Ross writes complex tales of passion and intrigue with fascinating (usually somewhat damaged) characters.  This is my *favorite* type of historical romance and I confess that I stayed up all night finishing \\"Night of Sin\\".  While I suspect that her books are probably not for everyone, readers who enjoy more sophisticated, slightly darker romances and prefer writers (such as Laura Kinsale and Judith Ivory) who are not afraid to break some of the \\"rules\\" of the genre likely will love this book.    The story is set in Victorian England (in contrast to Georgian settings of her more recent books \\"The Seduction\\" and \\"The Wicked Lover\\".)  Lord Jonathan Devoran St. George, so called Wild Lord Jack, is the younger son of a Duke who has spent an unspecified number of years traveling in Asia.  He is a fascinating, complex hero--tremendously charming, handsome, brilliant and sensual; however, his experiences in the East have left him feeling estranged from his homeland and his family. He returns home to England at the beginning of the novel tracking a rare fossil that already has led to more than one murder.  When the sailor carrying the fossil slips it into the basket of innocent Miss Anne March just before he is murdered, Jack must concoct a plan to both protect Anne and recover the fossil.    Anne, a shy, somewhat mousey young woman and the daughter of a minister, has recently gotten engaged to a scholarly young man.  When Jack insists that she travel alone with him to his family estate, Wyldshay, for her protection, she reluctantly agrees.  On the trip, she finds herself bowled over by Jack's good looks and charm.  She develops a serious case of hero-worship for Jack and he finds her honesty and wit engaging.  When their enemies and a storm conspire to strand the couple for the night at an abandoned cottage miles from their destination, Anne's sexual curiosity and naivete combined with Jack's misplaced faith in his ability to control his own desire lead to the loss ofAnne's virginity.     I agree with other reviewers who thought that Anne's behavior in the cottage was out of character for a quiet, timid minister's daughter who, prior to that episode, did not seem to have a wild side, but Jack was nothing if not *tremendously* attractive and seductive (so really, I don't blame her!)  The action slows down quite a bit once the couple reaches Wyldshay and has to face the consequences of their rash behavior--but frankly, I really liked that part of the book.      In summary, this is a beautifully written historical romance full of passion and adventure.  Julia Ross weaves a memorable tale of an unexpected love between two very different people who end up being each other's salvation.      An excellent book!  Highly recommended!	2005-01-11

I will admit that I was a little bit leery of the plot-line of this book because it sounded somewhat contrived (widowed gentlewoman masquerades as dockside prostitute/woman of loose virtue in order to rob rich, upperclass men targeted because they have exploited weaker women), but the story in Liz Carlyle's hands is *very* well done and the characterizations excellent! <br />   <br />The heroine, Sidonie Saint-Godard, is refreshingly unusual and very well-drawn.  Sidonie's motivation for her dangerous behavior is complex and rooted in her resentment of her powerful father's treatment of her mother.  She is a very independent, intelligent and imaginative woman, but she is far from perfect.  Sidonie is a risk-junkie and driven by demons from her past--some of which she does not even acknowledge to herself.  She is headed for trouble when she selects the cynical and dissolute Marquess of Devellyn, Aleric Hilliard, as her next target. <br />   <br />The Marquess is called \\"The Devil of Duke Street\\" (but don't hold that against him--he is a much less hackneyed character than that name might suggest to historical romance aficionados.)  He is a wealthy, dissolute rake, but he is not the standard-variety polished, charming \\"romance novel\\" rogue.  Aleric is a man *literally* wasting his life on drinking, gambling and meaningless relationships--thereby punishing himself and his father for mistakes made in the past.  He is very rough around the edges but he has a good heart, as Sidonie comes to realize only *after* she has victimized him.  Aleric finds himself becoming obsessed with both Sidonie, his elegant widowed neighbor, and her alter-ego, the Black Angel, without realizing that the women are one in the same (somewhat similar to the theme of Connie Brockway's excellent \\"All Through the Night\\".) <br /> <br />The development of Sidonie and Aleric's relationship is very well done, and the plot is interesting (although it does bog down just a little at the end) and the romance is edgy and hot (as usual for a Liz Carlyle novel.)   <br /> <br />In summary, this is a well-written historical romance with unusually good character development and a unique, compelling plot.  Highly recommended, especially for those who like slightly darker, more complex, character-driven romance!	2005-01-08

The tone of the story is light and the action a bit improbable, but it is a fun story with an engaging hero and heroine.  The story is told in the first person past-tense, reminiscent of an old Victoria Holt novel.      The heroine is Kate Fitzgerald, granddaughter of a viscount but daughter of an Irish horse trader, who has been raised poor but happy by her nomadic father.  Kate is a typical regency heroine--young (18 years old), spunky (this is \\"romance novel code\\" for idioticly reckless), beautiful and charmingly unaffected.  She is also horse-mad and a fabulous rider (seemingly a prerequisite for a Joan Wolf regency heroine.)  After her father's death, Kate is sent to live with her villainous uncle Martin, the current viscount, and unwittingly is used by him to trick his arch-enemy, Adrian, the Earl of Greystone into compromising her and thus an unwanted marriage.      Adrian is a fine hero--handsome, rich, noble and a hero of Waterloo (he is also good with horses!), and Kate soon finds herself falling in love with her husband.  The familiar \\"Doomed to a Loveless Marriage\\" and \\"Big Misunderstanding\\" plot devices are trotted out--of course, both Kate and Adrian mistakenly think that the other is in love with someone else and are afraid to confess their growing love for each other.      This book has plenty of action--kidnappings, murder, sword fights, an incognito visit to a gaming hell, and two *very* evil villains.  Kate is charming but a bit gullible--she is constantly needing to be rescued by Adrian or his brother, Harry.     In summary, this a fun historical romantic suspense story--well-written and very entertaining.  If you like this book, definitely read \\"The Arrangement\\" and \\"The Pretenders\\"--also by Joan Wolf.	2004-12-28

Jean Ross Ewing (AKA Julia Ross) is a *very* talented writer, but her stories definitely are not light, fluffy romance.    But, AH!, the hero!  Dominic Wyndham is the type of hero that I *adore*. The disgraced younger brother of an earl, he is dangerously charming, gorgeous, complex, intelligent, and driven by demons from his past. Dominic initially appears to be nothing more than a dissolute rake and libertine who lives outside the bounds of polite society and supports himself by gambling and winning foolish wagers.  Those who have previously read \\"Illusion\\" (in which Dominic was a secondary character), will be aware that he had worked as an intelligence officer during the Napoleonic wars, so there is more to Dominic than the initial impression would suggest.  But he is a very complex character and his actions and motives are not *always* pure.  He is not above demanding that the heroine travel as his mistress and trying to seduce Catriona, particularly when he believes that she is lying to him and using him for her own purposes.  His faults and weaknesses make him a more believable and three-dimensional character, to my mind.     Catriona, unfortunately, is not as compelling a heroine.  She is a Highland lass who is fanatically devoted to saving her people from being driven from their homes by the English aristocracy.  She is a *very* strong, proud woman but since she spends a lot of the book keeping secrets from Dominic (and the reader), she seems cold and distant for much of the story.  I agree with the reviewer that stated that it was hard to understand what Dominic found so appealing about her.  She spends the beginning of the book snapping things at Dominic like \\"Och!\\" and \\"Love! The word is soiled in your mouth!\\"  She gets a lot better by the end of the book, but it is a long road up to that point.    The plot is interesting and *not* completely predictable--the action is well-done and the romance *hot*.  This book still suffers from the problem that I had with \\"Illusion\\"--really stilted dialogue, especially between the hero and heroine.  At least Dominic does not spend the whole book quoting obscure poetry at Catriona (a la Nigel and Frances in \\"Illusion\\"), but nor do they talk to each other like normal people, not even normal *really smart* people. It is clear that Jean Ross Ewing is very intelligent and well-read, and the wealth of literary references and ideas makes her books richer, but she does make her characters wrap their mouths around some really ridiculous, awkward dialogue at times.  This is not such a problem in her newer works, published under the name of Julia Ross.    But this is still an excellent book, far superior to the majority of historical romances--well-written with interesting characters and ideas.  Dominic is a unique, memorable hero--so well-drawn and attractive that I wish that he were *real*  (If he were, watch out Catriona!)  If you like this book you will *love* \\"The Seduction\\" and \\"The Wicked Lover\\", written by the same author (Jean Ross Ewing/Julia Ross).	2004-12-27

I am a pretty picky reader and tend to get put off by scenes and characterizations that are wildly improbable, so my problems with this book are not likely to be universal (what I mean to say is, loads of people *loved* this book, but you picky readers out there know who you are.)      I did like the character of the heroine, Lorelei Dupree, a spirited and spoiled girl from Charleston who has just gotten engaged to the man of her dreams at the beginning of the book.  Lorelei is self-confident, spunky and vibrantly attractive.  When her fiance, Justin, concocts a plan (a stunningly wrongheaded and improbable plan) to entrap the notorious pirate Black Jack Rhys which involves Lorelei posing as a barmaid (?? this is supposed to be in 1780 and Lorelei is a gently-bred lady????), Lorelei happily agrees and (of course) ends up being taken hostage by Black Jack.    Fortunately for Lorelei, the pirate ship is a comfortable *palace* of a vessel (with windows!! and multiple extra guestrooms!! and yummy food!! and art supplies!!!) and the pirates are perfect gentlemen.  When Lorelei expresses a preference for the color yellow, her room is redecorated with yellow bedspreads and lacy curtains and YELLOW ROSES (Whaaaat?????  They just *happened* to have yellow roses on a pirate vessel???)  Romantic but ridiculous, in my opinion.    Captain Jack Rhys is a good hero--gorgeous and remote, damaged by his (really!) horrible childhood, he has managed to become (improbably) well-educated and wealthy.  He rejects the idea of love and announces his intention to seduce the lovely Lorelei.  And, well, you know where this is going, but it is pretty much fun getting there. (For those devotees of the classic pirate tale \\"Windflower\\", Jack is a bit like a grown-up Cat, but without Cat's brittle shell.)      The romance was fine and the story moved along reasonably well, although thiswas not a book that I stayed up all night reading.  I do dislike books that break up chapters in the middle of a conversation for no apparent reason and the original cover of the book was one of the absolute *worst* (half-naked block-headed dark-haired man draped in a sheet--Jack is supposed to be a blonde hottie and I *HATE* naked men on the covers of my books!)    This was a fun (rather improbable) tale with a nice romance and a good hero and heroine.  Recommended for those readers in the mood for a fluffy pirate romance.	2004-12-12

While I'll admit that \\"Hearts Aflame\\" is not great literature, it is a fun romp in the medieval romance style and I stayed up half the night finishing it. <br /> <br />I loved the character of the heroine, Kristen Haardrad, a spirited Viking girl who stows away on her brother's ship and ends up being taken captive by Saxons when the Viking raiding party is ambushed.  My favorite part of the book was the beginning when the Vikings are trying to hide the fact that Kristen is a woman from their captors.  She is discovered (of course) by the virilely handsome Saxon lord, Royce of Wyndhurst, a man who, unfortunately for Kristen, saw his family murdered and his beloved fiance raped and murdered by Viking raiders five years previously. <br />   <br />Royce is a decent-enough hero (although he has the usual \\"medieval romance hero\\" attitude toward women--i.e. women as sex objects to be used at will) and this grates on modern sensibilities.  Kristen is definitely a fiesty heroine and not afraid to go after what she wants and I did like her for those things.  I was disappointed that she fell so *quickly* for the man who was enslaving her and became his mistress.  It seemed a bit out of character for a girl who was so *very* proud and raised in a strong family such as hers.   And she is *definitely* not the poster girl for the \\"No Means No\\" campaign against coercive sex. (I'll admit, I am not a big fan of that kind of raped-but-still-enjoyed-it sex scene that was so popular in the 1980's.) <br /> <br />The book has alot of action and Kristin is one heck of a tough heroine (I loved the part when she goes after Royce's cousin with a knife!)  My book did *not* have Fabio on the cover, but it is certainly a \\"Fabio-on-the-cover\\" kind of book, albeit a really fun one! <br /> <br />Recommended for readers who like medieval romance (with warnings to those who are offended by the \\"woman as love slave\\" plotline.)	2004-12-06

Mary Jo Putney is never afraid to tackle more complicated issues in her historical romances (i.e. alcoholism in \\"The Rake\\" and depression in \\"Veils of Silk\\"), and she takes on some doozies in \\"The Bartered Bride\\"--slavery, rape and its aftermath.  <br /> <br />The heroine, Alexandra Warren, is a young widow who is traveling back to England from Austrailia with her young daughter when their ship is attacked by pirates in the East Indies and Alex is sold into slavery.  Six months later, Captain Gavin Elliott is visiting the island of Maduri and sees Alex being sold in the local slave market and attempts to buy her freedom.  The Sultan of Maduri refuses to let him, recognizing that Gavin's concern for the English slave woman may be a way to control the independent Captain.  Gavin must risk his own freedom and even his life in a series of tasks known as \\"The Lion Game\\" before the Sultan will agree to release Alex.   <br /> <br />Gavin is about as decent a guy as you will ever find in a historical romance and Alex is a *very* strong heroine.  The story is complicated and the situations heart-wrenching as Gavin tries to help Alex recover from the abuse that she endured as a slave and resume her life.  This is definitely *not* light, fluffy romance, but it is different and interesting and very well-written for the most part.  (The boiler-plate last minute rescue scene at the end was a bit over-dramatic for my taste, but was fun to read if a bit predicable.) <br />   <br />A well-written book about a complicated subject with a wonderful hero and strong heroine. <br />	2004-12-04

I'm not sure what it was about this book, but it didn't click with me.  The writing was very good and the characters were well-drawn; however, the story left me cold.      I think that the heroine, Jessica Trent, was a little *too* perfect for me--fabulously beautiful, amazingly intelligent, incredibly sensitive, anachronistically independent, *and* sexually savvy (while still being a virgin at 27 years of age!)  I love strong heroines, but she is *too much* of a \\"Mary Sue\\" for me.  I like my heroines to have a few chinks in their armor. The hero, Lord Dain, was interesting and unusual (I liked the uncompromising portrayal of his \\"rakishness\\"), but he frankly did not appeal to me.  Too much self-pity and I *hated* the way he treated his illegitimate son.    This is a *very* popular book and it is not a bad read, but I think that it is *over-rated* < ducking to avoid the rotten fruit being thrown by rabid fans of the book >.  Sorry, maybe I just read it on a bad day.	2004-12-02

It *amazes* me that anyone who enjoys historical romance would give this book anything less than 5 stars, but I guess that everyone has his or her own taste.  In my humble opinion, Judith Ivory is a nonpareil as a writer in this genre, and this book is one of my favorites.    Judith Ivory is a master at drawing sexy, memorable, three-dimensional heros and Stuart Aysgarth, the new Viscount Mount Villiars, is no exception.  Gorgeous, bright, mysterious and *imperfect*, Stuart returns home from self-imposed exile in Russia after his estranged father's death in an effort to keep his inheritance from being usurped by his uncle.  When his carriage accidently runs over widow Emma Hotchkiss's prize ram, she relentlessly seeks economic compensation--and the fun begins!     Emma is a delightful heroine--clever, funny, vulnerable and attractive without being physically perfect.  The sexual attraction between Stuart and Emma crackles off the page from their first meeting and the romance between the two is beautifully and believably developed.      Judith Ivory definitely pushes the envelope of historical romance, and clearly (from some of the reviews here) is not for everyone.  Her writing is far more intelligent and polished than that found in the average historical romance, her characters are more complex and her plot lines are unusual and uncompromising.  If you like Laura Kinsale and Julia Ross, you will probably like Judith Ivory's work.      A FABULOUS, well-written book that is a delight to read (and re-read!)  My favorite of Judith Ivory/Judy Cuevas's since \\"Sleeping Beauty\\".      Very, very highly recommended!	2004-12-02

This book is definitely a cut above the usual Regency romance--set apart by its polished prose and unusual plot.  I enjoyed \\"The Improper Wife\\" a great deal and particularly liked the character of the hero, Captain John Grayson.  Gray is the estranged second son of an earl and a calvary officer who is awash with guilt (and brandy) at the beginning of the book over the death of his young pregnant Spanish bride.  Into his rooms bursts the heroine, Maggie Delaney, who promptly gives birth on his floor to a baby boy.  Maggie's \\"husband\\" was an imposter who had assumed the name of Captain John Grayson and she is destitute.  Gray fobs Maggie and the baby off on his cousin, Harry, and his noisy wife, Tess, and heads back to the Continent for the war.  Tess snoops in Maggie's luggage and finds the false marriage certificate. Harry, mistakenly believing that Maggie is Gray's wife, takes her to Gray's ancestral home to live with his family.  When Gray finally returns from the war two years later, Maggie is a beloved member of his family and has firmly established herself as his wife.  He is incensed by her fraud but finds himself perversely attracted to her and reluctant to expose his family to the scandal that would ensue should he challenge her claim. <br /> <br />I found the character of Gray to be very appealing--a very decent, honorable man who is haunted by his father's lifelong rejection and his own guilt over his young wife's death.  I will admit that I had trouble with the character of Maggie.  She is a strong heroine but I could not like her willingness to let Gray pay for what were *her* own mistakes. Wanting to have a secure home for her son was her excuse for lying her way into Gray's life and she *never* came clean even when her lies were destroying Gray's life and his reputation with his family and closest friends.  I frankly would have liked her alot better if she had stopped playing virtuous lady of the manor and made some attempt to do the right thing (i.e.support herself or at least admit the truth of the matter to Gray's family).  She also refused to trust Gray with the story of her marriage and the possible murder of her false husband.  This is obviously a plot device to prolong the suspense in the story, but it served to further alienate me from the character of the heroine.   <br /> <br />Despite this reservation, \\"The Improper Wife\\" is a very well-written and enjoyable book.  The sexual tension is very well done and the hero and heroine actually are given a chance to get to know each other before they fall into bed together!   <br /> <br />Highly recommended!	2004-11-29

It is not a flawless book, but it is very well-written and different enough from the garden-variety historical regency to rate 4.5 stars to my mind.    The heroine of the story is Vivian Rael-Lamont, a widow living in a small town on the coast of Cornwall, who supports herself with her floral business.  Vivian has a secret that she wishes to hide from the town, so when the slimy Shakespearean actor, Gilbert Montague, threatens to reveal her secret, he is able to blackmail her into approaching her wealthy neighbor, William Raliegh, the Duke of Trent.  Vivian's task is to obtain a valuable original Shakespearean sonnet that is in the Duke's possession.  William is a recluse, suspected of murdering his wife and shunned by society.  He is intrigued by Vivian and her request and offers her the manuscript in return for her \\"companionship\\".  Vivian, attracted to him and desperate to appease Montague, agrees to his proposal.  I thought that the characters of both Will and Vivian were well-developed, sympathetic and attractive.  The fact that they were both in their mid-thirties was a refreshing change from the usual fare (in which the hero is in his thirties and the heroine barely 20 years old.)  The romance between two lonely people who were damaged by their previous marriages was quite well done and the sexual attraction/tension between them was great.  (One quibble--the language that they use to discuss sexual matters is more in line with Dr. Ruth Westheimer and less in line with a Victorian gentlewoman and man.)     The mystery part of the story is a bit convoluted and while entertaining, was rather hard to believe.  This story really shines whenever the hero and heroine are interacting--initially with verbal fencing and later learning to love and trust each other.    In summary, this is an well-written historical romance about two interesting, lonely people.  I recommend it to readers of historical romance who need a break from stories set in London and peopled by members of the *ton* and to those readers who enjoy character-driven romance.	2004-11-21

Perhaps it was because so much of the story seemed familiar from other books.  I agree that the first scene of the book was *very* reminiscent of the first scene in Georgette Heyer's masterful \\"These Old Shades\\", when the Duke of Avon rescues Leon/Leonie from a beating on the streets of Paris (but without the detail of the Leonie's distinctive hair color to catch Avon's eye and make the rescue more believable.)      The heroine of \\"Love's Charade\\", Danielle de St. Varennes, is a 17 year old French aristocrat who has been surviving on the streets of Paris disguised as a boy (her entire family has been killed by a pre-French Revolutionary mob) and the hero is Justin, the Earl of Linton, a 34 year old English peer.  I confess that I tend to *hate* books with this kind of age disparity between the hero and heroine, particularly when the hero affects a paternalistic attitude toward the heroine and calls her childish nicknames (this book is guilty on both counts and \\"Brat\\" is the appellation of choice.)   \\"These Old Shades\\" had even a greater age disparity between the hero and heroine, but worked better for me because of the development of the characters and the lack of overt lusting by the hero for the teenage heroine.  (Justin actually tells Danielle's grandfather \\"...the woman in her still sleeps.  I look forward to the very pleasant task of awakening her.\\"  A bit icky, in my opinion, but some might find it romantic.)    The real problem that I had with this book was that Danielle was *such* an incredible \\"Mary Sue\\" of a heroine (i.e. outrageously beautiful, amazingly intelligent, wise beyond her years, and good at absolutely *everything* she does)--and even more irritating than the original Leonie with her (supposedly charmingly) reckless behavior and brash speech.  Combine this with a relatively bland Justin (who is like the Duke of Avon \\"Lite\\") and over 400 pages makes for a long book.    Iliked the French Revolution setting and the story is well-written, but I preferred Jane Feather's \\"Virtue\\" (an engaging story of a brother-sister team of gamblers bent on revenge--a bit like Georgette Heyer's \\"The Masqueraders\\" but without the cross-dressing!)	2004-11-17

As someone who *loved* Harris's books \\"Red Dragon\\" and \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" almost to the point of obsession, I cannot believe that the same person who created such complex, fascinating books as those two wrote the distasteful mess that is \\"Hannibal\\".  Boo!!! Hiss!!!  I felt almost as if I was reading a sequel by a different author who never had understood the characters or the appeal of the books in the first place (a la the bogus \\"Gone With the Wind\\" sequel...)       To my mind, it was not the gross-out factor that made the first two books great, but the fabulous psychological interplay between the bright, honorable (and properly nervous) FBI agents and the brilliant psychopath anti-hero.  Hannibal Lecter as a misunderstood hero with a back-story just did not work for me.        Yuck! Yuck! Yuck! to the ending!!!  My copy of this book ended up in the *garbage*.

In order to introduce some tension in the story, the hero, Alec Black, the Earl of Iversley, is drawn as a *nice* fortune hunter who rather undeservedly has the reputation of being a thoughtless rake, and the heroine, Katherine Merivale, is dead set against marrying a rake (because her father was one and he shamed and beggared the family--blah, blah, blah--you have also heard that one before, I'm sure).  The heroine's money is in trust until she marries, so she is both penniless *and* a heiress (an unusual twist), so her family needs her to marry *someone* so that they can get their hands on the money.  <br />I liked the characters of both the hero and heroine, unlike some of the other reviewers who disliked Katherine.  There was a bit too much protesting by Katherine of the type that becomes irritating (i.e. \\"No, no, NEVER!\\" that becomes \\"Yes, yes, YES!\\" with a touch of the hero's lips...)  <br />The story was fine but rather predictable and flat.  The romance did not leave me breathless.  <br />In summary, this is an reasonably well-written story with an attractive hero and heroine that fails to rise above its rather tired plotline to become something truly memorable. <br />I liked it but I did not love it.	2004-11-11

This book has been on my list of favorite historical romances for years; I re-read it recently because I was getting burned out on the more recent offerings in the genre.  It still stands out as a superior and fun read, full of action, adventure and romance. <br />   <br />My favorite part of the book is the hero, Alec Tyron.  Alec is the \\"King of the London Underworld\\" (which, I agree, does not sound all that romantic)--a street orphan who has pulled himself up from the London gutters by virtue of his quick wits and good instincts.  He is also loyal, gorgeous (that never hurts in a romantic hero!), amazingly sensitive and has a good sense of humor.  He is a hard, self-made man with an endearing streak of insecurity (a la Derek Craven from Lisa Kleypas's \\"Dreaming of You\\".) <br />   <br />The heroine, Lady Isabella St. Just, is the sheltered, lonely, unwanted wife of a libertine earl who meets up with Alec when he \\"rescues\\" her from a botched kidnapping/murder attempt.  The relationship of Alec and Isabella is very well developed and believable (but will *not* please readers who hate adultery in their romance novels).  Neglected by her father and her husband, Isabella has come to regard herself as unattractive and unlovable, yet she is never a whiny victim. It is a pleasure to watch her blossom and gain confidence under Alec's protective care. <br />    <br />While \\"Tiger's Eye\\" is not a perfect book (Alec's profession is really *very* unsavory and dangerous and this is never truly addressed, and Isabella does a bit *too* much protesting at certain points in the book), it is a very well-written story with a fabulous hero and pretty hot romance.  It is a definite *keeper* for me and I highly recommend it to readers who love historical romance.	2004-11-11

I had been putting off reading this book for awhile--saving it as a special, rare treat since it was the last Judy Cuevas/Judith Ivory book that I had not yet read.  And, oh my!, it is a *WONDERFUL* treat, well worth savoring!      \\"Dance\\" is the sequel to Judy Cuevas's exceptional novel \\"Bliss\\", a delightful and touching romance set in France in the early 20th century, and it is every bit as good a book in its own way.  Only a masterful writer of Judith Ivory's caliber would have been able to transform the stuffy, pompous older brother (Sebastien de Saint Vallier) and the chubby, gauche wallflower of an unwanted fiance (Marie Du Gard) from \\"Bliss\\" into an engaging, realistic romantic couple.  The story is set three years after the end of \\"Bliss\\" and Marie has spent the intervening years in America, learning the craft of film-making.  She returns to France in an effort to gain financial support from her rich but estranged father and encounters her past crush, Sebastien, who has become her father's right-hand man.  Marie has become just the kind of modern, bohemian woman that straight-laced Sebastien cannot abide; however, he finds himself unaccountably mesmerized by her.  Sebastien represents everything that Marie has worked so hard to put behind her, and yet she is still attracted to him.    As usual for a Judith Ivory/Judy Cuevas book, the writing is far superior to anything else in the historical romance genre, the characters are beautifully and fully drawn and the story is memorable.  The book is outrageously expensive in the used-book market, I presume because the lucky few who own it do not want to give it up.  Of course, I'm keeping my copy!    Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys intelligent, well-written historical romance!	2004-11-04

The \\"innocent kidnapped by pirates\\" theme has been done to death, but never so delightfully as in \\"Windflower\\".  <br />Merry Patricia Wilding, an 18 year old American, is accidently kidnapped by a band of pirates led by ruthless Captain Rand Morgan and his second-in-command (and half-brother), the drop-dead gorgeous Devon Crandall. The majority of the book takes place aboard the pirate ship, the \\"Black Joke\\", as Merry gradually and believably matures from a innocent, helpless girl to a more capable, confident young woman.   <br />The secondary characters in this book are some of the best in the genre--I read this book at least six months ago and I *still* think about Rand, Raven and (especially) Cat, while I can barely recall the names of the *main* characters of many of the other books that I have read since then.  I really liked the character of Merry as well, although I am not usually fond of beautiful but somewhat dimwitted ingenue heroines.  The book was written in the 1980's when romantic heroines tended to be much less capable gals than the current crop of ladies, but Merry's character (sweet, unaffected and plucky) is so well-drawn that I could not help liking her and I could see why the pirate crew ended up being her champions.  Devon was a worthy love interest, although a bit harsh to our sweet heroine some of the time (but hey, he was a pirate!)   <br /> <br />The dialogue in this book is *inspired*, the plot action-packed and the sexual tension delicious but not overdone.  It is a long book but I read it twice in a row when I first got it--it's *that* good!      <br /> <br />Very, Very Highly Recommended!!	2004-11-03
US	48354998	R5HG9VJZ9SCZZ	0060091290	575112977	Secrets of a Summer Night (The Wallflowers, Book 1)	Books	3	75	96	N	N	Not up to her usual standards	This is the first book in a new series by Lisa Kleypas about a group of four \\"Wallflowers\\" in England in the 1840's, and, quite frankly, it bodes poorly for the rest of the series.  I found the story, characterization and particularly the *romance* in \\"Secrets of A Summer Night\\" to be very flat. The heroine in the book is Annabelle Peyton, an upperclass girl who has fallen on financial hard times since the death of her father.  Annabelle is essentially a female fortune-hunter.  She has spent four seasons in London trying to land a wealthy peer as a husband with no luck.  This despite the fact that she is drop-dead beautiful, well-bred and reasonably intelligent.  No one will have anything to do with her (well, anything respectable anyways) because she has no dowry.     Simon Hunt is the son of a butcher who has managed to become insanely wealthy through investing in railroads.  He is also surprisingly well-educated (and, of course, virilely handsome and brawny.)  He has been lusting after Annabelle for years, but for some reason wants to make her his mistress, not his wife.  Our hero and heroine are thrown together at a house party given by Lord Westcliff (the brother from \\"Again the Magic\\") where Annabelle is stalking Lord Kendall, a mild-mannered member of the peerage with an interest in botany.  I like character-driven romance and this is an area where Lisa Kleypas usually excels; however, I felt that the characters of the hero and heroine in this story were never more than superficially developed.  Annabelle was described by Lord Westcliff as \\"shallow\\" and \\"self-absorbed\\" at one point in the book, and, quite frankly, he is not completely wrong.  She is also a snob.  Simon is an okay hero, but he seems only sketched in when compared with past Lisa Kleypas heros (especially of the \\"self-made man\\" variety).  The secondary characters of the \\"wallflowers\\" are an interesting element in the book--perhaps a bit *too* interesting. The characters of Lillian Bowman (the brash American heiress) and Lord Westcliff (the staid English Earl) are obviously heading for a firey collision later in the series and, even from the sidelines, they set off alot more sparks than Annabelle and Simon ever do.  In summary, \\"Secrets of a Summer Night\\" is a readable bit of fluff--not memorable and not up to LK's usual standards.  For those who read historical romantic fiction only occasionally, I would definitely recommend skipping this one and trying \\"Dreaming of You\\" or \\"Lady Sophia's Lover\\", also by Lisa Kleypas.	2004-10-29

She meets Waldo Bowman, a popular war hero and rake about town, when he comes into her office to complain about about an article published about him in the newpaper's gossip column (written by Lady Tellall, who is actually Jo's friend, Lady Chloe Webberly.)  Jo and Waldo feel an instant attraction that they both try to deny--Jo because Waldo is a known rake and she hates rakes because her father was one (yeah, I know, you've heard that one before), and Waldo because he *likes* being a rake and wisely perceives Jo as a threat to his bachelorhood. <br />The hero and heroine are thrown together as they investigate the mystery of Chloe's disappearance and attempt to help an abused orphan from Jo's town.  Although both the heroine and hero are interesting and attractive, their characters seem a little bit underdeveloped to me (particularly Waldo) and I think that this adversely affects the romance in the story.  The plot was interesting and the mystery was reasonally good.  I liked the development of Jo's deceased husband, was a little bit baffled as to why Jo and Waldo were fighting over the orphan, Eric (lucky kid, most penniless orphans don't have people who are essentially strangers fighting to take care of them) and found the villain suitably villainous (although for someone trying to uphold the family honor at all costs, his behavior was misguided at the very least.) <br />All that said, \\"Shady Lady\\" is still a very well-written, enjoyable romantic suspense novel.  It is just not as good as most of Elizabeth Thornton's other books. <br />	2004-10-18

I find most of Elizabeth Thornton's Regencies compulsively readable, but \\"Dangerous To Hold\\" is one of my favorites.   I really enjoyed the character of the heroine, Catherine Courtnay, an accomplished, unusually self-sufficient woman, particularly for the 19th century.  Catherine, a writer and spinster, is leaving the London home of a member of the demimonde (after visiting her estranged sister) one evening when she is accosted by Marcus Lytton, the Earl of Wrotham, who mistakes her for his missing wife, Catalina.  He had been tricked into marrying Catalina three years previously while recovering from a war injury in Spain and had not seen his wife since the night of the wedding.  Although Catherine resembles Catalina physically, Catherine is eventually able to convince Marcus that she is not his missing wife.  Marcus believes that Catalina is hiding in London and behind several attempts on his life, hoping to inherit his fortune.  He convinces Catherine to masquerade as his wife in an effort to draw Catalina and her accomplices out into the open. (Not sure if this idea really makes sense, but it serves to throw our hero and heroine together....)  The story contains a number of twists and turns, unusually good secondary characters with an interesting secondary romance, and a moderately good mystery plot.    Highly recommended for readers who enjoy historical romantic suspense, particularly if you are bored with the usual Regency heroine (i.e. an 18 year old dingbat) and looking for a story with a strong and memorable heroine.	2004-10-15

Jeanne du Marchand, a French nobleman's daughter, and Douglas McRae meet as teenagers in Paris before the French Revolution and secretly fall in love.  When Jeanne discovers that she is pregnant, she tells her father who, instead of allowing the lovers to marry as they wish, perversely separates them and sends his only child off to live in a convent (seemingly forever) after the birth of her child.  Jeanne and Douglas are told by Jeanne's nasty father and his equally nasty housekeeper/mistress that each has abandoned the other and their child.  Why on *earth* they would believe this (especially given the sources) and why they would take *forever* to question each other about it when they are reunited (through an unlikely coincidence) in Scotland years later is the most frustrating aspect of the book.   <br />The characters are well-drawn (although Jeanne is a bit too passive for my taste, presumably due to having had all the spirit beaten out of her during her long years in the convent) and the writing is good, but to my mind the rather implausible plot and especially the lack of communication between the hero and heroine undermine the story.  I had trouble believing that two people who had so little faith in each other and  who talked to each other so *little* could really be in love.  Also unbelievable is the concept that Douglas would hire his child's own (he believes, *faithless*) mother to be her governess and then start up an affair with the presumptive governess-to-be. (Baffling behavior for a supposedly devoted single father...) <br />In summary, this story did not really work for me (and I am a *big* fan of angsty romance and not totally opposed to the *big misunderstanding* as a plot device, as long as it makes a little bit of sense.)  I absolutely *loved* Karen Ranney's book, \\"After the Kiss\\", so perhaps this book is a fluke.	2004-10-12
US	48354998	R1DXJL7XXIQE85	0743463862	959674095	The Accidental Duchess	Books	4	14	14	N	N	4 1/2 stars--Fun book- quirky characters and snappy dialogue	This is the first book that I have read by Jessica Benson and I stayed up half the night finishing it.  \\"The Accidental Duchess\\" is an unusual historical romance (set in England in the early 1800's) in that it is told from the first-person point of view by Lady Gwen, a new bride who discovers that she unintentionally has married her long-time fiance's twin brother.  The arch tone of the narration and Gwen's witty, frequently hilarious asides to the reader distinguish this book from others of the genre.  The cast of characters is huge and amusingly detailed (and in some cases quite over the top!)  The characters of the twin brothers, Bertie Milburn, a charming fribble and Gwen's original intended, and Harry, the paragon Earl of Cambourne, the elder twin by 15 minutes and Gwen's actual groom, are delightfully drawn.  There is a hilarious scene in which Gwen's girlfriends list all Cambourne's \\"good points\\", \\"bad points\\" (none, of course!) and \\"traits as they relate to Milburn\\" that reads like a 19th century version of \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\".   <br />The character of Gwen is charming but a little bit more difficult to get a hold on (surprisingly, since the she is narrating the story.)  She is described as biddable and obedient at the beginning of the book, but frankly she never seems to be so.  She seems a bit ditsy at the start of the story, but by the end she is spouting off facts about the Corn Laws and taking control of her life.    <br />The weak part of the book, in my opinion, was the reasoning behind continuing to keep Gwen in the dark about the real circumstances of her marriage (Hmmm, wasn't she was following her parents' wishes to marry Bertie in the first place..) and the explanation for Cambourne and Milburn masquerading as each other (Huh?!)  Obviously, both of these circumstances were necessary for the plot to work and the book is so clever in other ways that the holes in the plot logic are forgiven. <br />In summary, this is a unique, very well-written romance with numerous laugh-out-loud lines (and scenes) and delightful, frequently quirky characters that remind me of some of Georgette Heyer's more broadly-drawn secondary characters (although with more bawdy mouths!) Highly recommended and a fun read!	2004-10-01
US	48354998	RCU68SFUMI35K	0060098538	654096350	Black Silk	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Absolutely Gorgeous Character Study	Looking over the past reviews, this is definitely a book that you either love or you hate.  Personally, I wish that I could give this book 10 stars because it is so *very*, *very* good and the characters are so beautifully drawn and memorable.    The character of Graham Wessit, the Earl of Nethem, is one of the best libertines ever created in romantic fiction--a gorgeous, charming risk-taker who is so full of life that the heroine, Submit Channing-Downs, the prim widow of his former guardian, is drawn to him despite herself.  Judith Ivory makes Graham so real that every other cookie-cutter duke rakehell hero in the \\"garden variety\\" romance novel seems pale and flat in comparison.  In my opinion, Graham's faults enhance his appeal and humanize his character.  Submit is as unique a romantic heroine as her name would imply, but an interesting character and a wonderful foil for Graham's brilliant appeal.    The story allows the relationship between Graham and Submit to develop slowly and believably (a fact which readers interested in a quick, fluffy romance will find frustrating.)   I cannot recommend this book more highly for readers of historical romance who are looking for something better written, more mature, and more memorable than the usual fare.  If you like this book, I would also recommend \\"Bliss\\" and \\"Starlit Surrender\\"  by Judy Cuevas (Judith Ivory) and \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" by Judith Ivory.  Even if you don't like this book, Judith Ivory's newer works are a bit more mainstream (\\"The Indiscretion\\" and \\"The Proposition\\") and still excellent.	2004-09-29
US	48354998	R2V5ZJR0ID2ZWE	0446604798	371748010	The Arrangement	Books	5	25	26	N	N	Top notch regency with a very engaging heroine and hero	I have read several of Joan Wolf's Regency novels and have enjoyed them all.  \\"The Arrangement\\" is a very well-written book with strong lead characters and an interesting plot.  The first person point of view (the story is told by the heroine in the past tense) is a refreshing change of pace from the usual romance novel.  Because the heroine, a young widow by the name of Gail Saunders, is telling the story, we do not have to constantly get beaten over the head with descriptions of her beauty (i.e. her flashing blue eyes and her silky raven locks, as would be the case in the *typical* romance novel); the author lets us know that she is beautiful by the things that the other charcters say and do.  Gail is a wonderful heroine--strong enough to care for her young son, Nicky, by herself after her husband dies, proud enough to resent the implication that she cannot take care of her family, human enough to be rueful about her shabby wardrobe when dining at Castle Sevile and passionate enough to fall in love with Raoul, the Earl of Sevile, against her better judgement and to enter into \\"an arrangement\\" with him which she suspects will leave her with a broken heart. <br />Raoul is a wonderful hero--fabulously handsome and obscenely wealthy (of course), but also loyal, kind and intelligent.  He is perfect in every way for Gail except for the fact that he is light years above her in the social strata.  The development of their relationship is very well done and Gail's conflicted feelings about it are heartfelt.   <br />The mystery part of the book is also entertaining, although a bit predictable.  Lord Devane, Raoul's cousin, has died and left a bequest to Nicky, Gail's young son.  Immediately this raises questions about Nicky's parentage which Gail refuses to answer.  When it appears that someone is trying to kill Nicky, almost everyone is a suspect until the mystery is neatly unraveled.   <br />My only complaint with this book was that the ending seemed a bit too pat, but that is not a major problem. <br />In summary, this is a *very* enjoyable book with an engaging heroine and hero.  I would also recommend \\"The Pretenders\\" and \\"The Gamble\\", also by Joan Wolf.	2004-09-29
US	48354998	R2CUVPJBJVUSR1	0451404750	292146731	Nightfall	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Fascinating story line	As usual, Anne Stuart has come up with a fascinating, complex storyline and a sexy, dark, *bad-boy* hero. The hero (or anti-hero) of \\"Nightfall\\", Richard Tiernan, is about as bad as they come, a philandering husband who has been convicted of killing his pregnant wife and is suspected of killing his children and at least one of his former lovers. The heroine, Cassidy Roarke, is thrown into the path of Richard (who is out of prison while his case is being appealed) by her father, an egotistical author who is writing a true-crime book on Richard's case.    The interaction between Cassidy and Richard is deliciously suspenseful from their first meeting (Cassidy is scrounging through the refrigerator, believing herself to be alone in her father's apartment, and suddenly realizes that Richard, the convicted murderer, is in the kitchen with her.)  Anne Stuart does a wonderful job of developing Cassidy's growing fascination and interest in the magnetically attractive Richard, despite her concerns that he may be a serial killer and seems to have targeted her for some mysterious scheme of his own.  Why four stars instead of five?  The book contains some major holes in the plot logic (in my opinion) which cannot be discussed with spoiling the story, and I had trouble believing that Cassidy had fallen in *love* with Richard at the point in the story where she suddenly blurts it out (*lust*, definitely yes, but not love).  Regardless of these flaws, the book is a MUST READ for Anne Stuart fans--dark, complex, suspenseful, with memorable characters and lots of (very) steamy sex!  In summary, this is an excellent romantic suspense (for those who like them dark and edgy), but not as good as \\"Ritual Sins\\" (my personal *favorite* Anne Stuart).	2004-09-24
US	48354998	RMSZML3C898RP	0440211077	859877142	Keeper of the Dream	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Excellent book!	This is a wonderful book.  The plot has been exhaustively summarized by other reviewers and I heartily agree with the five star reviews.  The characters of Arianna, the headstrong Welsh princess, and Raine the illegitimate (and rejected) son of a Norman earl are very well drawn and the plot line is very engaging.  Almost more impressive are the three-dimensional secondary characters who populate this book--Hugh, the Earl of Chester and Raine's (legitimate) half-brother; Taliesin, Raine's puckish squire (is he what he seems to be?); and Sibyl, Raine's beautiful childhood love who ended up marrying his brother.  <br />The reluctant romance between two proud, headstrong people who are enemies at the start of the book is reminiscent of Judith McNaught's \\"Kingdom of Dreams\\" (another excellent medieval).  The mystical elements of the book were handled very well and help to make Arianna's gradual softening toward Raine more realistic as she gains insight into his (horrible) past through her gift as a seer.    <br />In summary, this is a very romantic and well-written book about two very strong but sympathetic characters.  Highly recommended and worth the search through out-of-print books!	2004-09-23
US	48354998	R2YCUKBH3XLE9L	0446614254	365093099	The Runaway Duke (Warner Forever)	Books	4	75	86	N	N	Really 3 1/2 Stars -- Pleasant but not really memorable	This is a respectable effort for a first book by this author.  The character of Connor as the hero is likable enough and unusual.  He is the heir to the \\"richest dukedom in England\\" (aren't they all!) but in the confusion after the Battle of Waterloo, he is presumed dead and he escapes to a life of anonymity.  This is the fulcrum about which the book turns; unfortunately, to my mind, it is not a very believable plot device. The stated reason for his flight is that his father (the Duke) is emotionally and physically abusive and that Connor feels constricted by his role as the Duke's heir, but to abandon a life of wealth and position to become a groom (with a phony Irish accent) in a country baron's stable for eight years seems an extreme reaction.  What ever happened to traveling the world, waiting for the old man to die?  Supposedly, Connor had stayed in England for so many years instead of emigrating to America (as he had planned) because he was fond of his employer's daughter, Rebecca.  Since she is only 12 years old when he first meets her (himself a grown man in his 20's), that idea is far-fetched and even a little bit creepy.  The character of Rebecca Tremaine as the heroine is less  interesting to my mind.  She is given some unusual characteristics to make her seem more unique, but her interests in medicine and anatomy seemed forced to me, and her behavior frequently is rather childish (not surprisingly, since she is only 17 or 18 years old.)  The story strays too close to that time-worn plot of the experienced older man brought to his knees by the adorable, spirited ingenue to be truly memorable (see Georgette Heyer's \\"These Old Shades\\" for such a plot in one of its original iterations.)   The book has lots of action as Connor and Rebecca travel around England, on the run from Rebecca's parents and troops of murderous highwaymen and fall in love.  The writing is generally good (although the plot relies on some ridiculous coincidences, for example the whole locket incident), the romance is sweet and the story entertaining.  In summary, this is a quick, light read that I imagine will please readers who enjoy books by Julia Quinn, since the tone seemed similar to me.	2004-09-15

The hero in this story, Christy, is a not a typical historical romance rakehell but, in fact, a vicar in a small town.  The heroine, Anne (Lady D'Aubrey) is Christy's childhood best friend's unhappy, cynical wife.  The characters are amazingly well drawn and sympathetic even in their faults.  The friendship that develops between Anne and Christy and their eventual mutual (and, of course, forbidden!) attraction is very believable.  I *loved* the character of Christy, a truly honorable and good man, full of good humor and optimism.  What a refreshing change from the the usual angst-ridden libertine nobleman hero of most historical romances (actually the sequel to this book, \\"To Have and To Hold\\", features such a hero and is also an excellent, but much darker, book)!<br /><br />Bravo to Patricia Gaffney!  This book is a real treasure and the memorable characters will stay with you long after those from other books have faded into oblivion.	2004-09-08
US	48354998	RRQVVJWOLV3O8	0449006360	894257952	The Duke	Books	3	6	7	N	N	Could have been so much better	This is the first book of Gaelen Foley's that I have read and I ordered it because it turned up so often on reader's list of favorite books.  It is an entertaining and engaging tale, but ultimately I found the book frustrating for a number of reasons, predominately due to inconsistencies in the character's behavior.  Most problematic for me was the character of Bel--was she a plucky, innocent lass trapped in a bad situation or a poised, sexually-bold courtesan?  Her decision to become a courtesan after her rape experience was bizarre, in my opinion. As was her willingness to initiate all sorts of sexual acts with Hawk (the repressed duke hero) when she was essentially a virgin except for the rape.  The scene where she and Hawk troop out of the carriage (after an eventful ride!) in front of all the servants with their clothes half pulled off made me cringe.  Far-fetched to think that the servants would ever treat her with anything but disdain after that episode.    Hawk's behavior is also inconsistent and unrealistic.  A reputed model of propriety, he moves his mistress into his own home, then into his country home *with* his younger sister and her young friend, has professional parties at his home with his mistress as the hostess, etc., etc.  Pretty rackety behaviour by 19th century standards.    The murder mystery part of the book was also a bit hard to swallow, in my opinion, and a rather clunky plot device to bring the hero and heroine together.  All that said, the book was well-written and I did like the development of the romance between Bel and Hawk, particularly the (very realistic) emotional trauma of realizing that marriage and happily-ever-after was probably not in the books for a paragon duke and a very high profile courtesan.   The theme of love between a courtesan and a gentleman is similar to that of Judith Ivory's wonderful \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" (with particular similarities in the denouement!), but I found Ivory's characters more believable and engaging.	2004-09-02

Mine is obviously the minority opinion here since this book is rated 5 stars by customers with over 350 reviews, but I was disappointed and almost did not finish reading the story (an unheard of event for me since I frequently whip through a novel a day!)  My problem was less with the book's plot(which was rather good) and more with the writing style. The writing and sentence structure, particularly at the beginning of the book, was distractingly uninspired and it really detracted from my enjoyment of the story. Towards the end of the book, things got a bit better (perhaps because the story became more engaging.)   <br />The story itself is a romantic fantasy with entertaining elements of time travel and a theme of enduring love.  Unfortunately, the heroine, Dougless, is a spineless doormat at the beginning of the tale (another problem with the book, in my opinion) and the hero is a bit too conceited and high-handed in his treatment of her (I mean, after all, he was supposed to be her *soulmate* \\"Knight in Shining Armor\\" pulled by love through over 400 years to be with her--he could have been a *little* bit nicer to her...)  I suppose that compared to everyone else in the book, Nicholas (the hero) was *relatively* nice to Dougless, but only because the rest of the characters treated her so appallingly bad.  On the plus side, she does gain some self-respect by the end of the tale and Nicholas eventually does become the kind of lover that one would be willing to travel 400 years to meet. <br />This book is wildly popular, so clearly my complaints are not universal; however, for a truly fabulous and well-written romantic time travel story, I would go straight to \\"Outlander\\" by Diana Gabaldon.	2004-08-31
US	48354998	R1WII7RPCEJZV	0440221080	849749795	Sea Fire	Books	2	22	23	N	N	Not her best effort	Karen Robards has written some of my favorite historical romances, but this is *not* one of them.  The characters of Cathy and Jon are too one-dimensional and their emotional growth in the story is just about nil (particularly amazing since this book is the sequel to \\"Island Flame\\"--300 plus pages of more of the same.)  The two books were written in the early 1980's, so I believe that they are some of Karen Robards's earliest efforts.  Near the beginning of \\"Island Flame\\", beautiful Lady Catherine is captured by a pirate ship captained by the very handsome Jonathan Hale.  Despite the fact that she is half his age and a virgin, Jon rapes her repeatedly (he later denies that it was rape because he has managed to wring a little response out of ther on occasion.)  Looked at objectively, his behavior is what you might expect from a pirate captain in the mid-1800's, and I might even have been able to get past it and forgive him for it if he had ever really taken responsibility for his bad behavior and *changed*!  But he never changes.  He is still the same violent, insanely possessive, thoughtless, serial mis-understander and rapist almost all the way through \\"Sea Fire\\".  All this *after* he has declared his love to Cathy at the end of \\"Island Flame\\" and has lived as her husband for two previous years.  Needless to say, Jon is a very troubling \\"hero\\".  To my mind, he is unsatisfying even as an anti-hero as he lacks any underlying vulnerability and redemption.  His misogynistic tendencies are explained away as a result of the trauma of discovering that his stepmother was a whore--but that seems inadequate given the depth of his pathology.<BR>The problem with the hero is compounded by the lack of a compelling heroine.  Cathy is constantly described as beautiful and desirable (even immediately post-partum! How is that for romantic fiction!) but she is also a vain, thoughtless, tantrum-throwing twit.  She is also plenty verbally and physically abusive in her own right.  Although she never does anything to deserve Jon's horrible treatment, she does frequently throw kerosene on the fire of his rage by her reactions and insults.  Not smart, in my opinion and she *never* learns.  The \\"I hate you/I love you\\" thing gets very tiresome before the book is half done.<BR>They are also *terrible* parents (abandoning a 2 year old for a year with the nanny and leaving a one month old baby alone on a beach while they frolic all night at a distant site on the island--shudder!)<BR>Given what has gone on in this and the previous book, the ending of \\"Sea Fire\\" is not satisfying.  I was waiting for Jon to come crawling back *on his knees* and to prove that he really had changed his ways--and I am still waiting.  The comments from Cathy's nanny and her father about what a great guy Jon was and how well he had treated her were *appalling*.<BR>In summary, this book was ultimately unsatisfying and not one of Karen Robards's best efforts.  I would recommend instead one of her other, much better, historical romances, such as \\"Dark of the Moon\\", \\"Tiger's Eye\\", \\"Loving Julia\\", \\"Desire in the Sun\\" or \\"Dark Torment\\".  For a much more entertaining take on the \\"innocent kidnapped by pirates\\" theme read \\"Windflower\\" by Laura London--well worth it if you can get ahold of a copy.	2004-07-14

At well over 600 pages, this book is much longer than your average romance novel and it is packed with location changes and secondary characters, mysteries and misunderstandings.  Part of the action takes place near Richmond Virginia and I was stunned at the research that must have gone into the book when I realized that the throw-away locations of roads that they took and inns at which they stopped were *accurate*!<BR>The best part of the book was the hero, Ruark. He was a fabulous character who made the best of everything that life threw at him.  The character of Shanna was more problematic for me (hence only 4 stars).  Frankly, she was a selfish, self-pitying, manipulative, lying brat at the beginning of the book and she took almost 600 pages to realize that Ruark's love was more precious than her pride and her fancy dresses.  Of course, she was *drop-dead* beautiful, but how on earth did she ever get a fantastic guy like Ruark to fall in love with her?  She *slowly* matures during the course of the book, but she is so immature and selfish during the initial part of the story than I could not ever really like her.  (A minority opinion, perhaps, since many other reviewers *loved* the character of Shanna.)  Alot of her behavior is excused by other characters because she was &quot;spoiled&quot; (yeah, no kidding) or &quot;very young&quot; (actually she was 21 or 22 years old, not really all that young).  Her only other good characteristics (besides her stunning beauty) were her plucky spirit and her intermittent concern for the villagers on her father's island (she also rides very well.)  In her favor, she is a strong character--consistent and rarely boring, even when she is most annoying.<BR>Despite my reservations about Shanna, this is a very good book.  <BR>The plot is very far-fetched but none the less vastly entertaining, covering lots of ground before Shanna and Ruark can finally admit their love to each other and everyone else.  The dialogue is rather stilted, but perhaps that is a nod to the Georgian period setting.  <BR>I enjoyed this book but preferred &quot;The Windflower&quot; by Laura London or &quot;The Hidden Heart&quot; by Laura Kinsale (both excellent sea adventure/pirate books!)	2004-05-18

I almost did not read this wonderful book because the trashy cover and syrupy plot synopsis on the back cover made it look like a really ho-hum bodice ripper.  In contrast to its packaging, \\"Starlit Surrender\\" is truly a delightful book and one of my favorites (along with Black Silk, Bliss, Sleeping Beauty and Untie My Heart) from Judith Ivory/Judy Cuevas.  To my mind, no other romance writer can touch Judith Ivory/Judy Cuevas when it comes to creating memorable and unique characters (except possibily Laura Kinsale.)  She is one of the few writers in this genre who is bold enough to give her characters serious flaws--e.g. heroines that are social climbers or who are susceptible to handsome men, heros with addictions to opium/ether or who are truly serial seducers--and clever enough to use these flaws to humanize her characters.   <br />In \\"Starlit Surrender\\", the characters of Adrien Hunt and Christina Pinn are beautifully and intelligently drawn and will stay with you long after you finish the book.  Adrien is a wealthy earl and a libertine, but unlike the garden-variety rake in the usual romance novel, he does not immediately foresake his rakish ways and other mistresses upon his first meeting with Christina.  He is brilliant, lethally charming and handsome, but also very spoiled, selfish, autocratic and imperfect (...)Adrien is a fascinating and complex character who has to be dragged kicking and screaming to the realization of how much he has come to love the heroine.  Despite his flaws, it is easy to see why Christina falls in love with him (despite her better judgement) even though she suspects that he will ultimately break her heart.  Her struggle to maintain her dignity and self-respect while being swept along in a love affair with a man who has \\"bedded every woman within fifty miles\\" is very realistic since she is definitely not immune to Adrien's charm, sex appeal, social status and wealth.  <br />The plot is entertaining with the action moving between England and France during the French Revolution, but it is the characters and intelligent prose that really carry this book.  I wish that they would re-release this book (with a better cover, etc) because it is hard to find!	2004-04-06
