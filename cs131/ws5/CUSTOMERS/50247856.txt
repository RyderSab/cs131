She said that it could be an influential step in life's journey.  After reading about the ten individuals whom Winifred Gallagher characterize as having the unique human ability to seek life's meaning, I can see why.  Society may have different kinds of names for these people.  Some might call them saints, some might call them holy, some might call them good.  They are quiet heroes who are moral, but moral in the sense of being compassionate; charismatic in the sense that they inspire others.  In any case, they are a refreshing change from the usual types of heroes who inhabit the media today: the socialite who people admire because of her glamour; the guy we admire solely because of his ability to hit a jump shot.<br />From the brother to the teacher to the activist to the preacher to the intellectual to the interpreter, these are people who possess what Ms. Gallagher refers to as &quot;spiritual genius&quot;.  Genius here, as she is quick to point out, doesn't necessarily mean intelligence. It refers more to its Latin root: Animated spirit.  And that means our own animated spirit as these people rise above the predicaments of the everyday world.  Issues like poverty, health, oppression, and abuse are combated by these folks every day.  They focus on three things: (1) a reality that more than meets the eye; (2) teaching by example - they don't &quot;talk the talk&quot;, they &quot;walk the walk&quot;, and (3) they inspire us by demonstrating the ultimate expression of our human potential.  After reading the stories of these people, I came to realize just how little I've accomplished in my own life and maybe how much there still is for me to do.<br />As the title implies, this is not a book about religion, it is a book about spirituality. And while one could argue that religion may not be perfect, Ms. Gallagher states that it has recorded, to a degree, our search for life's meaning throughout history.  She relates it to the &quot;biochemical universe that lies between our ears&quot;.  In this book, she tries to bridge science, which she studied, with spirituality, which she, as an author, is pursuing.  Spirituality, as Ms. Gallagher says here, shows us that when the student is ready, a teacher appears.<br />The summation of this book is that despite tremendous personas and religious differences between these ten people, these &quot;spiritual geniuses&quot; are all onto the same thing.  That is that human beings can develop a greater wisdom and commonality that will bode well for the future.  As a holy man said to Tenzin Palmo, the &quot;explorer&quot; of this book, &quot;You think we know some secret teachings that enable us to do great things but there is nothing that I know that you don't.  The difference is that I am doing it and you are not.&quot;  A lesson for us all, no doubt, as these people encourage us to allow our own light to shine.  Regarding light, an example is made that if you open a door into a dark room, light floods in, not vice versa.  Light, indeed, has the final say.  Always.  Thanks CKit to the &quot;biochemical universe that lies between our ears&quot;.

Certainly we all know folks who are extremely devote and yet we all could admit that probably more wars and carnage have taken place in the name of religion than any other subject.  Winifred Gallagher, in her book, is attempting to show us another side of religion, a side where religion is a process, a process of &quot;working on God&quot;.  For this is a book both about and for independent thinking people who are attempting to reconcile spiritual beliefs with their own somewhat skeptical intuitive rationales.  For me, this was a book that confirmed my beliefs and yet challenged me, all at the same time.  A central theme is that we are all, more or less, on a spiritual journey, and are called, if you will, to this time and this place, be it Reston, Virginia or Greenwich, Connecticut or wherever.  According to Ms. Gallagher, this journey is most important because it is not made alone but with others, others of even differing faiths than our own.  Her sense of spirituality is not the opiate of Marx but rather is one of being aware, awake, and living a life that is present.<br />Many of the people that she writes about start out in life having more than enough and yet, they don't have enough.  In their growth, if that's the right word, something starts to happen, something that has to do with holding on to what's important to them and letting go of what is not.  Ms. Gallagher presents some heartwarming instances, such as the stranger in church who tells her that he will pray for her critically ill son or the young Hasidic mother she sits next to on a cross country flight.  These people give her a different view of &quot;other&quot; and allow us to realize that, when it comes to things that matter, we are more alike than we all care to admit.  For that reason, she would probably argue that perhaps we should center our lives on the charity of our being and not in the virtue of religion.<br/>This is the type of book that looks at both sides of the spiritual coin.  Along these lines, St. Paul is attributed to have said, &quot;In order to know thyself, prove all things to strengthen your faith&quot;.  Leonardo Da Vinci once wrote that man should have faith in his own gifts and nurture them to the fullest.  Ms. Gallagher would appreciate the irony here, for a scientist is saying &quot;have faith&quot; while a saint is saying &quot;prove all things&quot;.  Towards the end of the book, she makes an interesting statement: &quot;Faith is the meaning of history&quot;. Teilhard de Chardin might say it is even (dare I use the word) evolutionary.  So, therefore, I came away from this book feeling that I understand what Ms. Gallagher is saying about anyone's spiritual journey.  The message may very well be that all that was is part of me, as I am part of what's to be.  Well done, Ms. G.	2003-10-24

Charles Schine learns this in spades in James Siegel's dark novel of suspense and deception.  Without giving anything away, Charles finds himself sitting next to the beautiful Lucinda on the Long Island Railroad and accepts her offer to pay for his ticket when he finds that he doesn't have his wallet.  One thing leads to another and, after drinks one day, lunch another day, and so on, they find themselves in a mid morning tryst at the Fairfax Hotel in Manhattan.  Unfortunately for them, things turn ugly when a thug breaks into the room, pistol whips Charles and brutally rapes Lucinda.  Siegel describes this in gory detail for about 10 pages.  After that, things really start to fall apart for Charles. How far do things fall?  Blackmail leads him to robbing funds from his own critically ill daughter's hospital fund. Murder and conspiracy are just around the corner. Charles attempts to take things into his own hands and turn the tables on the bad guy.  The only thing is ol' Chuck isn't Clint Eastwood, he's you or me, and the results are direly predictable.  The funnel that he falls into is dark and dangerous and Siegel, at times, makes it appear so hopeless that one feels that there is no way out. Still, I think the reader, in general, has to have some empathy for Charles because he is so much an \\"everyman\\".  When Lucinda asks him if he was a hell raiser in his youth, he answers, \\"heck raiser\\".  His Job-like situation throughout this book has us hoping against hope that everything happens for a reason, and maybe it does.<br />I grew up on Long Island and can just picture the 9:05 out of Babylon and all of the stops in between, so I enjoyed this book from a homey standpoint despite it darkness and even though some of the aspects of the scenes at the Fairfax Hotel are a tad too coincidental for my tastes.  Still, James Siegel is a contemporary of James Patterson and it shows with chapters that leave you hanging.  The book, as a whole, is a fast read. I read most of it on the metro going into D.C. for a meeting.  Still, I didn't sit next to any pretty girls.  All aboard.	2003-09-04

These play a major role in Dan Brown's novel of an ancient secret brotherhood, the Illuminati, and their quest to condemn and destroy Cathoicism as an organizational entity.  Robert Langdon, a Harvard symbiologist who also appears in &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, finds proof that the Illuminati still exist, and have hijacked a cannister of anti-matter from the Conseil Europeen le Recherche Nucleaire (CERN) and hidden it somewhere beneath the Vatican on the eve of the election of a new pope. A physicist has been murdered and Langdon and the physicist's daughter, also a scientist at CERN, follow a 400 year old trail through Rome to prevent the incineration of the Catholic Church as we know it today.<br />&quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot; pulls no punches and provides cover to cover action.  Sure there are assassins, 15,000 mph jets, anti-matter, mad scientists, murdered cardinals, sealed crypts, abandoned cathedrals, and ambigram branding irons, but Brown has it all hang together.  The ambigrams are of special note because they read the same, right side up or upside down, and this figures prominently in the story. And the entire story, all 600 pages or so, takes place in one day! Still, Brown hurls the reader along from one elemental to the next with breakneck speed and hardly a chance to catch one's breath.<br />CERN really does exist, as does anti-matter, and Brown points out that CERN has recently succeeded in producing the first particles of anti-matter and it is now the most powerful energy source known to man.  So, there is a lot of cerebral exercising in the book, be it physics, biology, church history, or papal conclaves.  While I, personally, found the ending somewhat predictable, Brown poses a larger question.  Will this substance, like atomic energy, be used to save the world or condemn it?  And this little piece of brain candy, as someone called it, gives us a glimpse of What if.  Good job Mr. Brown.	2003-08-08
US	50247856	RIXE9D9R31BQC	0142002623	689113993	The Company: A Novel of the CIA	Books	5	5	6	N	N	The American John Le Carre	Robert Littell proves, once again, that he is the connoisseur of the American spy novel.  In \\"The Company\\", he presents us with more than just a glimpse of a culture, or better yet, a fraternity, that has no written history for any of us to review.  He deftly mixes real life heroes and real life villans with excellently written fictious heroes and equally well written villans.  Some of his fictional characters represent real people.  That's what makes this book so compelling to read.  It is close to 900 pages long and yet, when you are done, he leaves you longing for more.  While reading it, it just doesn't seem like 900 pages.<br />An almost family affair, we see a generational history of the CIA depicted through characters both real and imagined.  Littell shows us both the CIA \\"successes\\", such as the defeat of the movement to overthrow Gorbachev, to its failures, such as the Bay of Pigs and the Hungarian revolution in 1956.  He gives us keen insights into many of these events.  One will recall vividly the people escaping from Hungary who, literally, followed in each others footprints, so as to throw off their numbers from the pursuing Soviets.  Or the comment from Bobby Kennedy following the Bay of Pigs disaster, where the new Administration needs a victory and, looking to a small backwater in the far east, he predicts, \\"Vietnam could be the answer to our prayers\\". This even as his brother, the President states, \\"Vietnam is too far away.  No one will notice.\\"<br />But it's not just the history or the historical tidbits - such as how many different ways were proposed to kill Castro, including botulism in his cigars, LSD in his home ventilating systems, or exploding sea shells where he went skin diving - it is often the description of the human side where Littell excels.  For example, the agent, who upon capture, reflects on the measure of \\"liberation\\" in that exposure is no longer to be dreaded.  Or the Company wife who shouts to her husband, \\"One of the reasons Ihate it (the CIA) is because you love it!\\"<br />Littell deftly takes us on this journey from 1956 Berlin to the present.  Robert Hanssen is here, even though he is not a Company man and we also see how monies are poured into the career of a former KGB man who becomes deputy mayor of St. Petersburg - Vladimir Putin.  Littell takes us on this ride and we never feel the bumps.  Well done.  Easily the best book of the year.	2003-05-29

This is the theme of the second novel by Daniel Silva to feature Gabriel Allon, art restorer and Israeli agent.  A deep subject no doubt, but Silva's pen never runs dry.<br />At first blush, I thought that the \\"English Assassin\\" of the title would be Gabriel himself, but no.  Silva introduces us to a professional, trained by Gabriel, but operating out of Corsica.  A slick rogue who takes any assignment provided the price is right and yet also needs to have a signadora remove the hex of an evil eye from his tarnished soul after what appears to be each sanction.  When Gabriel is induced to go to Zurich to restore the painting of a reclusive millionaire, we suspect all is not what it seems.  When he finds the millionaire murdered at the foot of a Raphael painting, one thing leads to another, including a secret collection that is missing.  But, then, why leave the Raphael?  Gabriel hooks up with Anna Rolfe, violin virtuoso and daughter of the slain millionaire and they head out on an intercontinental joy ride (Zurich, Portugal, Italy, Paris), seeking the murderer of her father and the key to missing objets d' art.  The story of the English Assassin is told almost in parallel with the adventure of Gabriel and Anna, culminating even beyond the point where their story is finished.<br />Silva knows his stuff, both his art and his history, as he portrays Switzerland as a trading center in looted art treasures. One of the characters in the book makes the statement, \\"Make sure no one else stumbles on any unpleasant reminders of the past.  This is Switzerland.  There is no past.\\"  Silva brings Gabriel back for his next novel as well.  Good idea for he is backing a winner.	2003-03-10

So, the last thing I expected was another tale of nanotechnology gone awry.  Crichton provides some hard science to back up his premise, but that kind of background is sorely lacking here.  Don't get me wrong, I like Dean Koontz. Few writers of this genre can write so eloquently about people you can care about.  But the characters here are stereotypical of Koontz characters from earlier novels.  Dylan, the too-good-to-be-true travelling artist and Jillian Jackson, on the road comedienne, meld together like other characters from Koontz novels gone by.  The only thing missing is a dog. But, then again, Dylan's autistic brother, who is a main player by the way, is even named Shep.  All three are injected with a serum by a total stranger while staying at a motel in Arizona.  The serum will affect their lives one way or another.  What it appears to do is causes them to be drawn to situations of great peril and allows Shep to develop the ability to \\"fold\\" from one place to another.  They are also pursued by what amounts to be, according to Koontz, \\"former Russian Spetznaz or American Delta Force gone bad\\".<br />The situations are, at times, cartoonist at best.  The bad guys who pursue the three heroes, in SUVs no less, are reminiscent of the Low Men in Yellow Coats and their big cars from \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\".  The \\"folding\\" that is introduced, which helps Dylan, Jilly, and Shep get out of some tight spots, reminded me of Scott Bakula and his sidekick Al in \\"Quantum Leap\\".  Human volunteers would not subject themselves blindly to nanotechnological injections, even if they were prisoners in Mexico, as the villian depicts here. And, please, no one, no matter what kind of whacko they might be, carries a briefcase with a bomb inside with him, just in case he needs to fake his own death.<br />The dialogue is, at times, even worse.  Koontz refers to one bad guy as a \\"human rodent\\".  After folding into the arctic, he later writes that Shep \\"...returned sans the scientist\\".  Sans?  Still, the way this novel ends, it appears as if the ol' Moonlight Club will be back for a sequel.  Maybe they'll bring the real Dean Koontz with them next time as well.	2003-01-24

Well, that might be true, but after reading this novel about adventures in nanotetchnology gone awry, anyone who is expecting a revisit to Crichton's classic \\"The Andromeda Strain\\" is on the road to a big disappointment.  Sure the science is there, but the story is weak and the characters are worse.<br />Jack Forman is an out of work software specialist functioning, for the first third of the book, as a modern day Silicon Valley Mr. Mom.  His wife, Julia, however, is at the forefront of Xymos Technology, and is working on a nanotechnology project for the military at a lab in the Nevada desert.  Just that sentence alone should clue you in to what is going to happen as nanotechonological \\"critters\\" are introduced into the ecosystem with a full fledged dose of predator-prey relationships.  Though Crichton tries to set the table for what is to come with an introduction to artificial eveolution in the 21st century, the early part of the novel spends way too much time on how stereotypical Jack kids are and entirely too much time on just what he is preparing for dinner that night.  When Jack is called into the Nevada desert to serve as a consultant for Xymos, things pick up, but just barely.<br />Where is the in-depth consequences of \\"Timeline\\" or the excitement of \\"Jurassic Park\\"?  Still, I just couldn't give a Crichton book just one star, but I have to admit that I kept saying to myself \\"Didn't I just see this on the Sci Fi Channel?\\"  My goal in finishing the book was the knowledge that I had the new Dean Koontz novel sitting on my bookshelf once I was through with this one.  A friend of mine also read this book and he said that \\"Prey\\" would make a great Made for TV Movie.  That should be condemnation enough, right there.	2003-01-13

Though they are separated by some 600 years of history, each is in pursuit of an abductor and murderer of children.  Similiar to her earlier novels, &quot;The Plague Tales&quot; and its sequel, &quot;The Burning Road&quot;, Ann Benson weaves two stories, one set in modern times and one in the 1400s.  Though this novel doesn't contain a physical link, such as the piece of cloth that ties the two stories together in &quot;The Plague Tales&quot;, there are enough nuances and references to keep any detective of historical fiction going.  While Lany's perpetrator is fictional, what makes Guillemette's quest even more eerie is that she pursues an actual person, the infamous Gilles de Rais, upon whom Bluebeard is based.  De Rais' debauchery is especially unnerving because it is based upon true accounts.  How many ghouls would save the heads of over 300 children just to determine who was the prettiest?  Ugh!  While the collection of the skulls of dead children is a key in the case against de Rais, a collection of footwear plays a part in Lany's investigation.  &quot;They eat small children there&quot; is a reference to de Rais' castle but it is also a movie title in Lany Dunbars 21st century Los Angeles.  In her pursuit of the serial abductor, Lany uses a text book that references de Rais.<br />We, as readers, cannot help but root for these strong willed women, both of whom must fight for everything they can in order to succeed in their endeavors in a male dominated society, in Guillemette's case, and in a male dominated profession in Lany's case.  Both must deal with the arrogance of their respective abductors and both must find the emerging pattern in their respective investigations.<br />Ms. Benson throws in some historical plums just for the interest.  The actual childhood nurse of de Rais was named Guillemette La Drappiere and some of the 21st century detectives are named forreal police detectives.  But, still, it is the villains who warrant our attention. The thief in each case here not only steals souls but steals lives as well.  And, when each seeks absolution and feels that it is at hand, each thief, as Ann Benson so beautifully puts it, will be as far from absolution as he would ever be in his life and yet more in need of it than ever before.  Five stars indeed.	2002-12-30
US	50247856	R2U4OF8SXOTVP4	0399148701	17508097	Red Rabbit	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Big, Red, and Long	Tom Clancy knows his stuff.  It may not always be the right stuff, but he doesn't have to rely on tricks and gimmicks while sacrificing plot and credibility to get a story across.  And you do have to put up with his politics, but, hey, he is the author. \\"Red Rabbit\\" starts out ever so slowly but builds to a small crescendo.  Students of history will enjoy the behind the scene nuggets that he works into the story.  The basic plot involves a letter that Pope John Paul II purportedly writes in which he threatens to resign and return to Poland if the Soviet Union doesn't start to behave itself. This would make him a formidable foe to the Iron Curatin. In actuality, John Paul did write such a letter.  At the heart of the conflict is a KGB courier with a heart of gold who is passing information from KGB Centre to Bulgaria as then-KGB boss Yuri Andropov sets in motion a plan to take care of this problem by assasinating the Pope.  Zaitsev the message man doesn't believe that the Pope deserves to die and he makes a move towards the American COS in Moscow Ed Foley.<br />Clancy brings back his usual suspects from the early Jack Ryan days.  Admiral Greer is here, Bob Ritter, Moore, etc.  But it is Ed and Mary Pat Foley who finally get their shot at a leading role.  Actually, the parts of the book that involve Jack Ryan are the most superfluous and add unnecessarily to its length.  No one cares how Jack's eggs benedict are or how he gets along with his wife and kids.  While there is an interesting detour with Cathy Ryan where a couple of British surgeons leave a patient on the operating table to go grab a pint at lunch, but that really adds nothing to the story.  Clancy could easily have cut 100 pages without blinking an eye.<br />The book is peppered with real people, like Andropov, that add some credibility to the story, which is fiction just like \\"The Day of the Jackal\\", the book this one will inevitably be compared with.  There is even a fictional person named Emma Thompson.But, it seems like Clancy occasionally is operating on automatic pilot.  He refers to Czechoslavkia as a city and calls Yugoslavia the \\"Communist San Francisco\\".  I bet Joseph Alioto would have loved that. When some of Zaitsev's information makes it to the British, one of them says, \\"He says the KGB is going to kill someone who doesn't deserve to die\\" and the operative immediately suggests the Pope.  That's quite a reach, don't you think?  As is Ryan and a British operative spotting one guy in a crowd of thousands, and Sir Jack still having time to sing the Marine's Hymn to himself.<br />This book is a long one to get through, easily over written, in my opinion, as I said.  But, it is a satisfying read on the subject.  Still, the way it is put together - with an eye toward the eventual movie - it's as if Miramax, New Line Cinema, or Warner Brothers said to Clancy, \\"Look Tom, we have Ben under contract.  Can you accommodate us with another young Jack Ryan story?\\"	2002-12-13

But we know Stephen King and this car isn't all that it seems to be and yet is also more than it appears to be.  The doors and trunk show us a link between our world and what, another star system? Another dimension?<br />This book will be devoured by King's many devoted fans - and I'm one of them.  I read this book on a business trip to Austin, Texas.  The inevitable comparisons will be made to \\"Christine\\", his other vehicular story.  Unfortunately, there's really nothing to compare.  Christine had personality and pizzaz ( I'm talking about the car here, not necessarily the novel ).  This car is devoid of any personality and is pure evil.  In the novel Christine, we see the development of the boy who owns her.  There is no development here.  This book reads like a short story that is 356 pages long.  For one, the scenery never changes.  We never see the troopers at home.  We don't even see a couple of them head to the university for some equipment to test on the Buick.  For the most part, we are at the station house and the parking area behind it.<br />Still, as a somewhat saving grace, King still can write about mokes you can care about.  And they are here - Sandy, Shirley, Arky, Eddie, Ned, etc.  Speaking of Ned, heck, I even went to Pitt, so that should count for something.  But, without any real in-depth dialogue and a plot where empty answers  - or no answers - is the tour de force, I have to say, well, Stephen, maybe retirement isn't so bad after all.	2002-11-27

They return to New York City, the scene of their first successful novel, \\"Relic\\", and they bring along one of the characters from that story.  In a nutshell, when work begins on a future apartment house in lower Manhattan, excavation uncovers some grossly murdered individuals who met their demise in the 1870s.  As the story unfolds, a serial killer with the same M.O. begins to terrorize every street and boulevard in old New York. Exciting?  You bet.  Still, as Lieutentant Columbo might say, it is those little odds and ends that just don't add up that do not give this book the same whack as previous efforts by the co-authors.<br />We do see some familiar faces here.  Special Agent Pendergast is back for an encore appearnace from \\"Relic\\" ( and everyone at the New York - read: American - Museum of Natural History remembers him ).  Archaeologist Dr. Nora Kelly and reporter William Smithback from \\"Thunderhead\\" are also main characters.  But it is Pendergast who really provides the loose ends that cause an otherwise action-packed adventure to not quite hold together at times.  For example, why does he draft Nora to study the remains at the site of a Donald Trump-wannabe developer?  For that matter, how does he know all about this and where does he come from?  If Pendergast is, indeed, from the New Orleans office then why does he live at the famed Dakota on Central Park West?  Pendergast is on the scene before the present day serial killer even appears, almost as if he (Pendergast) had some premonition that this would be happening.  His explanation of his presence and his recruitment of Nora leave both her and the reader, I might add, unconvinced, and his esoteric knowledge of interior decorating, art, and opera, among other things, are a tad unbelieveable at times.  Nora is easily the most believeable and most professional of all of the characters. But, her posing as a prostitute to get access to some of the remains is somewhat comical.  Smithback, her erstwhile boy friend, is more of a pain in the behind than a help.<br />While this somewhat entertaining tale might have been eagerly awaited, if I were to introduce someone to the writing of Preston and Childs, I might choose another avenue.  While no one would ever consider \\"Relic\\" great literature, that story really moves.

They can occupy the corner of a street or be half a block long. They're usually sandblasted with gargoyles carved into the facades, have a doorman who looks like a hobbitt, and will often have the silhouette of a lone soul sitting in the window. Is this person guarding the gates of hell? Caroline Evans, the heroine of \\"Midnight Voices\\" is going to get the chance to find out.<br />Following the death of her husband, Brad, who is murdered while jogging in Central Park at night - hey, you get what you pay for, right? - she meets Anthony Fleming. Fleming is everything a woman like Caroline could ask for: attractive, well off, eager to get her children to like him, and a resident of the stately Rockwell, a building that Saul thinly disguises as a Dakota-like wannabe, the building that was the home of the late John Lennon. But, once Caroline moves into the Rockwell she crosses the line between reality and imagination for everything in it isn't always what it seems. Why are there hardly any children in the Rockwell? Caroline's son and daughter increase the total of kids from one to three. What is the secret in her husband Tony's study? Do the dark rumors and children's stories about the Rockwell and its residents have any truth to them?<br />John Saul has come a long way from his first novel, a psychological thriller called \\"Suffer the Children\\". In his earlier works, it is a child or a young person who recognizes the demons and has to convinve the adult community of their existence. But here it is the adults - Caroline specifically - who sees the demons and recognizes that she must fight evil over the battleground that will be her own children. Caroline is reminiscent, to me, of Nora in Peter Straub's \\"The Hellfire Club\\". Both women are on their own and must use their own wits against what, at times, appear to be insurmountable odds. For Saul slowly weaves the threads that are the death of Caroline'sfirst husband with the death of her college roomate into a knot of evil that is hard to break.<br />Anyone who ever attended a family reunion, looked at a box of old photos, or picked up a daguerrotype and said, \\"Gee, isn't Mary the spitting image of Aunt So-and-So?\\" will think twice after reading this book.	2002-09-20

Ethan Ford is a local handyman, much beloved by the townfolk of Monroe, Massachussetts, who married the prettiest girl in town. He's a volunteer fireman and the kids baseball coach. He has also committed an unspeakable crime earlier in his life, in another state, that only comes to the surface as the story opens. The story is told through intervening chapters that focus on different people and their relationship to Ethan and his family. Ironically, very little of it is told from his point of view and that's good as it does not prejudice our view one way or another. It is through these other characters that we make our value judgement on his candidacy for forgiveness.<br />His wife Jorie is perhaps the most sympathetic character as she must wrestle with the fact that 13 years of her life were spent with a man she didn't really know. She travels to the scene of the crime and walks in the shoes of the man she knew as her husband.  This is the most hearwarming part of the novel. It is here that Jorie reads the blue diary of the title, but what is in it?<br />If you're looking for closure, you may not find it here. Who to root for? Ms. Hoffman leaves that up to you. But this story speaks of truths and, in the end, it is those truths that would crush us that also allow us to see the same light that shines from heaven.	2002-08-30

That fellow used his wits and his contacts to track the bad guys down.  Somewhere between \\"Jack & Jill\\" and \\"Roses are Red\\" Alex Cross got a little too big for his britches or, more accurately, a little bigger than life.  One got a little tired of hearing how he was \\"better looking than Muhammad Ali\\" or how heads would turn when he walked into a restaurant with a lady on his arm or how he would take over an FBI briefing for the Director ( when he wasn't even in the FBI ) or even how crying babies magically shut up once in his arms.  It got to be too much.  But the old, nose-to-the -grindstone, listen to Nana Mama, Alex Cross is back.  Or, at least, back for this book.<br />\\"Violets are Blue\\" tells the tale of vampire killers - \\"real\\" vampires that is.  But, don't worry, neither Bela Lugosi nor Christopher Lee are going to pop out of the shadows.  These vampires bite their victims, sure, but then string them up and drain their blood.  Pattison never does explain how it is they don't leave a mess ( aside from the corpse, that is ) but there is one credo that Cross does learn:  \\"When you hunt the vampire, the vampire hunts you.\\"  Cross, the FBI, and his latest \\"squeeze\\" from the San Francisco P.D., follow these ghouls on a cross country murder spree.  Pattison's usual short page chapters are fairly well packed with action.  Oh, and lest we forget, the Mastermind from \\"Roses are Red\\", whose identity we know but Cross doesn't, makes a final appearance.  A relationship between the Mastermind and earlier Cross mysteries ( and I mean very earlier mysteries ) is revealed.<br />There is still an allusion to \\"Super Hero\\" Cross.  He is involved in a fist fight while having an ice peak stuck in his chest - and he wins!  Still, I'll give him that one transgression because he does admit, \\"I'm always going in first.  How long am I going to keep it up?\\"<br />It's good to have you back, Alex.	2002-08-29

What would you do if you knew the exact date that humanity would cease to exist on this planet?  Oh, the date, by the way, is December 21, 2012, so we all have some time to ponder the answer. Not so for Mick Gabriel and Dominque Vazquez, the heroes of this apocalyptic novel that reads like Indiana Jones meets the X-Files.<br />Mick is the son of two noted archaeologists, who having stumbled onto a Mayan prophecy predicting the end of the world on this date, have left it to him to do something about it.  Dominque is his psychiatric intern, for you see, ol' Mick is a resident of the South Florida Evaluation and Treatment Center.  Get the picture?<br />The seed for this theory lies in Mayan mythology having to do with a caucasian &quot;God-man&quot; called Kukulcan.  The story is intermixed with pages ( and pages! ) of Julius Gabriel's journal. He is Mick's deceased father.  In the first quarter of the book, you'll be exposed to so many Mayan deities, characters, hieroglyphics, etc., that they will be coming out the yin-yang.  Unfortunately, the connection that Julius sees as proof - a connection linking Chichen Itza with Nazca, Stonehenge, Angkor, Giza, and Chicxulub ( the impact crater for the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction of the dinosaurs ) simply isn't there.  Julius points out that Chichen Itza is in a direct line with Chicxulub.  So what?  So is New York City.  Julius points out that the pyramids at Giza are in a line like the stars in Orion's belt - again, with the lines! - and, you see, those stars are the home base for whatever lies in Chicxulub.<br />Don't get me wrong, as a geologist I can say that the science isn't all bad.  The discussion on karst topography, for example, is decent.  But, on the other hand, Alten's picture of a velociraptor, living in what will become present day Louisiana ( they didn't, by the way ), being wiped out instantaneously by the meteoritic impact at Chicxulub simply isn't true.  For that impact resulted in changes in temperature, sea level, ecology, that lead to a mass extinction, but didn't wipe out 65% of the life on earth in an instant as is depicted here.<br />The characters also lack a lot.  The only one who I remotely cared about was Ennis Chaney, who becomes the first - and maybe last? - African American Vice President.  He is the one who asks all of the right questions and thinks in a rationale manner.  The so-called villian, Borgia, eye-patch and all, is a cartoon at best.  When Mick comes up from the underwater depths of Chicxulub and reports on seeing a creature down there, the resident government scientist blindly believes him by spewing out &quot;You mean there's a life form down there?&quot;  This, mind you, takes place AFTER he finds out that Mick has just escaped from a mental institution.<br />Still, Alten should be given an A for effort.  The premise is interesting and, if he can polish up the science and the format a little bit, I would be interested in seeing future novels by him.  It's just carrying so many names from Julius' journal and flipping back and forth to the main story isn't a great way to read a book.  That being said, now, who was the feathered serpent god of the Olmecs?	2002-08-16

There are no spiders coming along, no girls getting kissed, the all too perfect Alex Cross is nowhere to be found, nor is the Women's Murder Club of \\"1st to Die\\" fame here.  This book is also different from Patterson's non-series novels, such as \\"Season of the Machete\\" or \\"Cradle and All\\".  However, don't let the title fool you or don't let some other reviews fool you, for this is not a romance novel.  This is a novel about taking chances.<br />One line that pervades throughout the book is \\"Isn't it lucky?\\".  Isn't it lucky that Matt and Suzanne hook up on Martha's Vineyard.  Isn't it lucky that they have Nicholas for a child.  For this is a story about Matt, Suzanne, and Katie and the eternal triangle that they form.  It is also a story about three decent people who, in a manner of speaking, find one another.  The story is told in typical Patterson-like fashion.  About one hundred short chapters of 2-3 pages each, alternating between first and third person narrative.<br />The novel opens with Matt ending his relationship with Katie.  There are differing ways to end a relationship:  face to face, a telephone call, a letter.  Matt opts for the face to face option but, by way of explaination, sends Katie a copy of a diary written by his wife Suzanne to their son, Nicholas.  Wife Suzanne, you say?  I thought that they were decent people?  They are.  Don't stop reading by page 12, read to page 300 or so and then judge them.  While Suzanne remains fairly constant throughout, Katie's character certainly grows.  And despite what you might think, Matt ends up showing us that all men, indeed, are not pigs.<br />So, while there is no Alex Cross, no Gary Sonjei, no serial killers of any sort, Patterson delivers something just as good: a bittersweet novel of redemption of a sort.  A novel that leaves us saying \\"Isn't it lucky\\".	2002-07-31

Well, Simon Clark introduces us to what might be a possible beginning of that most unique of Halloween traditions.  John Newton, a British writer of true crimes, finds a letter at his door asking that a \\"pound of chock latt\\" be delivered to the \\"grief stowne\\" of one Jess Bowen by \\"Sabbath night\\".  If John does not comply, \\"Yew will be sorry if yew do not\\".  Well, John doesn't and an accident does befall his young daughter.  The \\"requests\\" continue - nothing major, mind you - a \\"pinte of porter\\", a red ball, etc.  John delivers on these occasions and he is rewarded with a couple of new book contracts.  But, as you can imagine, things aren't always what they seem.  For John and his family are being indoctrinated into a horror that resides in the Necropolis Cemetery next door that has been around since the Norman invasion.<br />Clark starts out slow but then warms us to the game.  John talks to some folks who had relatives the last time these letters started to appear around town some 70 years ago.  Specifially, a lady doctor and a old gentleman who is entering the dark tunnel of dementia, but snaps out every now and then, to leave John some clues and to fend off his son-in-law, who is trying to do him in for his money.  John realizes the extent of what could happen when he hears of one of his neighbors who suffers a stroke and his scalded by a red hot shower nozzle in a cheap motel.<br />Clark weaves a tale that, at times, appears to be collected off of the drawing room floor of Stephen King. I mean, a writer is the main character and a child, John's daughter Elizabeth, and the old gentleman ( Stan Price) are, at times, the books most appealing characters.  Others, such as John's hot-to-trot wife, Val, are less appealing.  And John's 17-year-old son, Paul, is involved with a girl named Miranda, who's sole interest appears to be keeping the condom industry going.  In the last quarter of the book, we see what their relationship has to do with the rest of the story.  For, you see, it is easy to adhere to the original requests - candy, a pint of lager, a toy - but when the request addresses something much more dear, much more precious, there's the rub.  Trick or treat!	2002-07-29
US	50247856	R77EC2XV95HIP	0449002128	330117464	The Kill Artist	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Silva at his best	Daniel Silva is rapidly becoming the leading writer of thriller/espionage fiction in the U.S.  Case in point is \\"The Kill Artist\\".  Silva takes a well worn formula:  a former operative leaves the business to pursue a new career ( in this case, a restorer of paintings ) but he is drawn back in by a former supervisor who teams him up with a former female agent with whom he has previously worked with and had an affair. Yet, with Silva's style and his economy of writing, it is as if we are treading on new ground.  Gabriel Allon is the art restorer ( the \\"kill artist\\" of the title) and former Israeli operative; Ari Shamron, his former boss ( imagine Ariel Sharon in a bombadier jacket); and Jacqueline Delacroix, nee Sarah Halevy, the grandaughter of Sobibor victims and a current fashion model but former Israeli secret agent, comprise this triddium.  When current Palestinian bad guy and super assassin Tariq \\"offs\\" some Israeli officials in Paris, Shamron puts the wheels in motion to bring Gabriel back in the game for one more mission.  Tariq had planted a car bomb under Gabriel's family, so revenge becomes the dish best served cold.<br />Silva takes us across three continents as the chess match pitting Gabriel against Tariq unfolds.  From the middle east to Paris and London to Montreal and New York, we see each move, each gambit.  Yet, Silva also takes time to explain how Gabriel, Jacqueline, and Tariq become who they are and how they get to their roles in this game.  Fans of Silva's \\"The Marching Season\\" will also recognize President James Beckwith and Ambassador Douglas Cannon.<br />Despite, every now and then, slipping in a sentence that doesn't make sense, Silva still gives us a good run.  For example, Tariq is a hard nosed killer, yet Silva states that he \\"didn't have the stomach\\" for hitting Jacqueline in the face with a gun. Such minor gaffs should be overlooked in the grand scheme of a good story that really moves from chapter to chapter.  The ending isn't quite what you would expect from a \\"normal\\" thriller and, even though the book ends right where it begins, nothing is quite as it seems.  I understand that Gabriel returns in Silva's next novel.  I can't wait.	2002-07-16
US	50247856	R1WAWWFH9XS9L6	0525946284	583024749	Jackdaws	Books	3	12	13	N	N	Jacdaws: "Chicks with Sticks"	Ken Follett, once again, finely blends history with fiction, in his latest WWII thriller, a story of 6 female undercover agents ( although one isn't all what she appears to be ) who attempt to crush the Nazi communication network in Europe literally days, and even hours, prior to D-Day.  \\"Jacdaws\\" is based upon the true story of Pearl Witherington, who was one of the 50 female spies used in the second world war.  Her fictional counterpart is Felicity \\"Flick\\" Clariet, who works with the French underground.<br />The first half of the book is really two stories told simultaneously.  The first is the story of how Flick recruits and trains her team to go into Nazi occupied France to destroy a chateau serving as the center of all German communciations after a failed mission, which opens the story, was unsuccessful in doing so.  The second story of the first half involves Dieter Franck, interrogator and torturer par excellence and how he plans to break the back of the Resistance.  The sections with Flick and the recruitment of her team are somewhat shallow.  Her recruits are somewhat unbelievable at first. When they are finally inducted into the armed services, Flick says to them ( and I swear this is the line from the book ) \\"You're in the army. Now drink your cocoa and go to bed.\\"  Dieter Franck comes across as much more of a deeper character.  An aide to Rommel of Desert Fox fame, he is drawn very well by Follet and, as a result, it appears a tad unbelievable that he would be outwitted by conicidence and blind luck when tracking Flick.  In the second half, when the two stories merge, the action and plot flows much better.<br />Still, Follett lets the gals be the heroes, as he should.  Paul Chancellor and the boys from SOE and MI6 are all secondary. I'm not giving anything away by saying that the Normandy Invasion comes off without a hitch and it's no secret that we win WWII.  Though \\"Jacdaws\\" is not as riveting as \\"Eye of the Needle\\" nor as in depth as \\"Pillars of the Earth\\", it is a good beach read.  Also, a  movie starring, maybe, Angelina Jolie, is certainly sure to follow.	2002-06-30

I gave her a Ken Follett novel and she gave me this one.  At first, I said to myself, Great, the literary equivalent of a \\"chick flick\\" from So-and-So's book club.  Boy, was I ever wrong.  \\"The Last Time They Met\\" is anything but that. It's so much more.<br />By now most folks know the gist of the plot, Thomas and Linda, lovers for the ages, meet again at a writer's conference.  Despite their relationships in the past, they have only crossed paths three times and the book is divided into three sections, \\"52\\", \\"26\\", and \\"17\\" that correspond to their ages at the time they are involved with one another.  The catch is that Shreve tells the story in reverse, beginning with age 52 and ending with age 17.  At the very, very end, in Shreve's words, the whole story is turned on it's ear.  So no peaking at that last page.<br />Two things I liked about this book.  First of all, Linda.  Her character grows in complexity as the story goes on ( and the ending explains why ).  Hence, she is more complex when she is younger, and maybe that is true of life.  She is sort of ho-hum at age 52, a little more involved at age 26, but complex and somewhat dark at 17.  Strangely, Linda is devotely religious as a teen but hates God passionately when she is older. She has a dark secret that is alluded to throughout the book and it's not too hard to figure out.  But it's the character development as she gets younger that really intrigued me.<br />The second thing I liked is that Shreve accomplished something that very few authors can do.  Elizabeth George can do it, James Michener could do it.  And that is write from the viewpoint of the opposite gender.  When she takes up the pen as Thomas, especially the part of the story that takes place in Africa, she really IS Thomas.  When Thomas runs into Linda at the fruit market in the town in Kenya and \\"watchs her walk away and all the blood in his veins follow her\\" Shreve is reminding us that when it comes to lost love, men can be such fools.  Linda and Regina meet and Thomas wants to separate them as soon as possible so that his conversation with Linda can go on for as long as possible.  Linda mentions her husband's name ( Peter ) and the sound of it is \\"like a slug in his chest\\".  I mean Thomas could have sat in Linda's cottage forever.<br />The second part of the book is, to my mind, the best written.  Shreve spent time in Africa in the 1970s and it shows throughout this section. She captures the romance ( small R ) of the dark continent.  Yet, it is the third section that, to me, moves the quickest, maybe because Linda is more proactive.  I read about 40-50 books a year but this may be the one that I enjoyed more than others because it just wasn't what I expected.  Well done Ms. Shreve.  And this is from a guy reviewing it.	2002-06-20

After reading the first book in this series, \\"The Golden Compass\\", I looked forward to the second and was not disappointed.<br />\\"The Subtle Knife\\" continues the plot of \\"Compass\\" as Lyra Belacqua (now Lyra Silvertongue) continues her search for the nature of the spiritual particle known as Dust.  After crossing over into the haunted world of Cittagazze, she encounters young Will Parry.  Will is from our world and, after providing a respite for his ill mother, begins the search for his father, an explorer who disappeared in the arctic shortly after Will was born.  Will accidentally trips into Cittagazze through a slice in the continuum.  Once they stumble onto one another Lyra and Will's adventures really take off.  Witches, soul-eating Specters, exploding dirigibles, shoot outs, break-ins at an English mansion, tortures, communications with spirits on an Oxford computer, even angels, percolate to the top in this adventure.  Wow!<br />We are reminded, however, that this is a little above \\"Harry Potter\\" as for the second time in two books one of the main characters close to Lyra dies.  As a matter of fact, a number of folks die in this story.  The much ballyhooed allusions to \\"Paradise Lost\\" abound. While no 12-year-old will necessarily be familiar with Michael and the fall of the angels, the subplot of Lyra's father, Lord Asriel, building a fortress to prepare to battle the \\"High Authority\\" for heaven will keep them glued to the pages.  References to a \\"New Eve\\" and a \\"New fall\\" keep the Milton comparisons churning along for literay students more interested in scholarship than in entertainment. Asriel, for example, is a son of Manasseh, who was related to Joseph of Technicolor Dreamcoat fame.  But who cares?<br />Still, if you think Pullman is anti-Christian because he paints the church in Lyra's world as totalitarian and shows little clarity as to whether the\\"Authority\\" is good or not, or whether you think he is sexist because Lyra cooks for Will, please don't lose sight of the fact that this is still a children's book where, hopefully, children's heroes will prevail.<br />As with all middle books of a trilogy, Pullman ends this one with a cliff hanger ending.  He concludes the series with \\"The Amber Spyglass\\".  I can hardly wait.	2002-05-28

With today's current scandal of priests molesting young boys, Jodi Picoult's novel is right on the mark with the NBC series.  Nina Frost, an assistant DA, who's job it is is to put these kinds of molestor's behind bars, experiences the nightmare of having her own 5-year old son sexually molested by a priest.  Nina, who should be a defender of the system, sees all too frequently, how it breaks down.  So, it probably is no surprise when she, literally, takes justice into her own hands, and shoots the priest.  Nina's - or maybe Picoult's - rationale is how often do we see the victim, once on the stand, turned into a defendant.  And all of this happens in the beginning of the book.  As in previous novels, we see what we might expect to be the climax of the story take place in the beginning.  What Picoult does is take these cloudy issues of right and wrong and run with them with characters that struggle left and right with the issues themselves and with one another.<br />The issues here very strong.  It's these characters that I have somewhat of a problem with.  Nina's husband is a stoneworker - nothing wrong with that as it is a fine profession.  But, for some reason, I felt throughtout the story that they are obviously and totally mismatched.  It's almost as if the child that they have is their only bond with one another.  He seems cold and distant to her.  On the other hand, there is a police officer who has known her for years and he comes across as absolutely adoring her.  Yet, either Nina never sees it or her own sense of morality won't allow her to even consider leaving her husband for a more supportive partner.<br />This was sort of an unusual book in that the story itself and the game that is afoot will have you turning pages, but when you're done, you might have wished for a little less hijinks and a lot more character development.	2002-05-24

This dark study of revenge that transcends generations really shows why.  However, this story is, at times, so dark that one might believe that this sort of thing happens every day in Portugal.  The present-day death of a 15 year old tart and its connection to Nazi gold and the Portugese tungsten market in WWII is at the heart of the story.  What connection you ask?  Well, at first, the only connection appears to be that these two parallel stories, told at the same time, both take place in Portugal and that's it.  Wilson makes the connection at the end, but, for me, it is quite a reach.  A little too much coincidence for my taste.  Still, the intrigue is there as well as the location.  I got dizzy with all the street names and locales, especially on the Iberian Peninsula.<br />Characterization is where the fault lies in this book not being a 5-star opus.  The characters are not very appealing.  Now, granted, some of them are nazis, some are thieves, etc.  But, for the first half of the book, the only character that I even remotely cared about was the girl who was murdered - and, techncially speaking, she isn't even a character, just a corpse.  Most of the men are portrayed as thugs and rapists.  Abrantes, one who parlays the tungsten line into a banking endeavor in Lisbon comes to mind as well as Felsen, an Oscar Schindler wanna-be who beats one of Hitler's goons at a card game and then, for punishment, get's tossed into Himmler's gang of thieves.  Case in point:  In one scene, at a roadblock, Felsen goes bananas and beats the tar out of a Brit and then tortures him.  Does he do this becuase the Brit is a spy or is it because they have both bedded the same girl?  And speaking of girls, most of the women are portrayed as ditzy or aloof.  Not a good combination.  Wilson can't seem to describe any of them without alluding to \\"frayed knickers\\" or \\"worn out nylons\\".<br />Still, in the second half of the book, Wilson putssome meat, and humanity as well, into his detective, Ze Coelho, and even into his young, upstart partner.  The intersecting stories parallel history, as well as politics and even social change and Wilson does a good job there.  It's just that if you can find someone to truely care about in this epic, you're a better man than I.	2002-05-20

Case in point:  \\"The Hellfire Club\\", which has at its center, one Nora Chancel.  I love Nora because she is a survivor, a pure heroine. In a story of good and evil, she is kidnapped, abused, sexually tormented, and yet, strangely coddled, in a perverse sort of way, by one of the darkest sick-os ever to drop out of Straub's pen.<br />This is the story of a story (\\"Night Journey\\") - who wrote it, who didn't, who stole it, who killed for it.  Tie in one Dick Dart, a serial killer who was born in the darkest recesses of Straub's imagination and we are, as Bette Davis would say, \\"in for a bumpy ride\\".  For Straub has created a villan who is the most sadistic, vile, malevolent creature this side of Hannibal Lector.  Every time he said \\"Nora-pie\\", chills ran up my spine and I heard, in my mind, \\"Hello Clarice\\".<br />Don't get me wrong, this is a horror story, but it is about the horror within our own souls.  It's a page-turner and you have to love Nora.  I did.  To paraphrase a song done by the late Artie Shaw, I had it bad and that ain't good.  But \\"The Hellfire Club\\", that's good.  Plenty good indeed.	2002-03-23

Forget the trysts with Science Fiction, Dan is back where he belongs, in the horror genre.  And he comes back with a &quot;sequel&quot; to &quot;Summer of Night&quot;, his epitaph to growing up spooky in 1960 Illinois.  It isn't necessary to have read the earlier novel and that's what makes this such a delight.<br />In a novel reminiscent of &quot;The Shining&quot; by another noted horror writer, Simmons takes us back to Elm Haven, Illinois, where (now) Professor Dale Stewart, former best friend of the now departed Duane McBride, returns to Duane's midwest farmhouse to spend the winter and to exorcize past demons of a since gone south love affair with one of his former students at the University of Montana.  Clair Hart nee Two Hearts is now at the ivy covered confines of Princeton and Dale has taken a sabbatical to return to his former home town (he can't go back home in Missoula because his wife and daughters have given him the boot as well) to try his hand at the Great American Novel, cicrca 1960, and locks himself away (or tries to) for the winter in the farmhouse.  The only problem is the demons in his head - and we get plenty of playback with Clair and skinwalkers and other neat stuff - these demons become all too real as he slips into his winter haunting.<br />Who's real and who's memorex?  Michelle, the former 6th grade cutie-patootie?  C.J. Congden, former tormentor and now (?) local sheriff?  Sandy Whitaker, who rents him Duane's old place?  And how does that olde english wind up on his lap top?  Questions come and go as we flip from first person narrative to third.  In the end, we're not sure just who we are rooting for.  Dan Simmons delivers the kind of stuff you don't want to read without the lights on. And, whatever you do, don't go upstairs!  Brrrr.	2002-03-08

Well, someone here left the doors open all right, but left the lights out.  Don't get me wrong, Jack Higgins is one of the grand old men of suspense.  Anyone who has ever read \\"The Eagle Has Landed\\" or some of his other novels under the Harry Patterson monicker (\\"The Valhalla Exchange\\" comes to mind) knows whereof what I speak.  But here, Sir Jack seems to be just writing on automatic pilot.<br />The premise is there: The search for a legendary religious icon, the Madonna of Scutari.  It's just that Higgins never completely drives home the point as to why agent provacateur Paul Chavasse would want to pursue this quest.  Is it because the girl he almost put the moves on at a party is involved or does he actually care about religious resurrgence in Albania?  Remember, when he's not saving Brittania, this guy also deals with Mafia dons.<br />Higgins, still the master at characterization and action (hence the two stars), does leave part of his thought process on the perverbial floor.  While in the fog, Chavasse has the drop put on him by a couple of the bad guys.  He's told to stand very still while he is checked for weapons and then he is instructed to \\"walk straight ahead and don't look round\\". As he is told by his captor that it would \\"desolate\\" him to kill him, it's only then that Chavasse realizes that his captor is speaking Albanian.  Only then, Paul?	2002-03-08

But who is to say that adults can't suspend their imagination and that grab that magic carpet ride into the world of make believe?<br />Lyra Belacqua, our main character, lives among the hallowed halls of Oxford in an England of an alternate universe.  But don't let that put you off for there are parallel universes that she will discover - one of them being our own.  For once she hears of the magical Dust, rumored to posses some pretty profound properties, her adventure (and ours) begins like a whirlwind.<br />This is an epic fantasy reminiscent of C.S. Lewis or Madeleine L'Engle. Lyra and her daemon Pantalaimon, take off to wonderous places that appear familiar to us at first blush.  A daemon, by the way, is a small creature that can take various forms and serves the same kind of role that, say, my generation would attribute to Jimeny Cricket.  Still, armored bears (who have first and last names - and can talk!) witches, \\"Gobblers\\" who steal children, all populate this novel, along with the alethiometer (the golden compass of the title) to make this a fantasy adventure that whisks us along like Indiana Jones at his best.  The bad news is that the book ends much too quickly for my taste, but the good news is that there is another one that follows.<br />A friend of mine, upon receiving a copy of a McCullough's autobiography of MacArthur at a News Years party, turned to her husband and said, \\"Ill start this as soon as I'm finished with Harry Potter\\".  Adults can make that journey to the land of make believe, and can fly, with their imaginations, to Never-Never Land.  Pullman's trip, however, is even better.  Hang on and enjoy the ride!	2002-02-15

This one is no exception.  I can't really call it a mystery becuase there really is no \\"who done it\\" - at least who done it in the terms that we would normally associate it.  Rather, Ms. Highsmith comes across like Ruth Rendell or maybe Elmore Leonard.  Not so much of a mystery as a crime novel where the plot really isn't the driving force, it's the characters.  She, like Rendell and Leonard, has created a few characters who bounce off of one another like billiard balls and move the story along.<br />Sydney Bartleby, an aspiring author-to-be, imagines a plot to kill off his wife Alicia, a painter.  Oh, he hasn't done it, mind you, but he has thought about it enough. So, when Alicia takes some time off away from ol' Syd because their marriage is reaching the straining point, Sydney begins a descent into the netherworld of his own imagination.  Did he kill her and bury her in a carpet in the middle of the woods?  The only person in the book who might even begin to resemble a \\"good guy\\", widowed Mrs. Lilybanks, their neighbor, isn't so sure.  Sydney leads the police on in their investigation and when it appears that his own fictions will rock and destroy his own life - and he keeps going on - you just want to shake him.  I found this to be just a little unbelieveable.  The last couple of chapters will either surprise you or leave you asking, \\"Is that all there is?\\"<br />Ms. Highsmith hasn't been that well publicized in the U.S. until one of her earlier novels, \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\", was made into a movie.  Still, like here classic debut novel, \\"Strangers on a Train\\", this one shows us what forces might be perculating just below the skin of everyday life.  Elmore and Ruth would be proud.	2002-02-15

And, indeed, this one is chock full of broken folks.  Leilani Klonk is a precocious 9 year old, with a leg brace and a deformed hand, who tries the power of positive thinking to grow \\" a good set of breasts\\", but is saddled with a drugged out mom and a serial killer stepfather who killed her brother and plans on doing her in by her tenth birthday.  Micky Bellsong, is a recovering alcoholic and former victim of child molestation at the hands of her mother's strange boyfriends, and lives with her Aunt Gen, whose head wound can't help her distinguish between what happened to her in real life and what happened in the movie \\"Mildred Pierce\\".  There is the boy who is \\"being Curtis Hammond\\" , a boy who isn't quite what he seems, but turns out to be much more. And what would a Dean Koontz novel be without a dog, and here we have Old Yeller, who does turn into more than he - or she, in this case, - could ever dream of becoming.  Leilani, Micky, Aunt Gen. and Curtis, get aid from Noah Farrell, the private dick with a heart of gold, as well as from Polly and Cass, a couple of gun-totting, ex-Las Vegas showgirls who are also UFO experts. All of these folks are caught in a UFO connected merry-go-round that more resembles Kurt Vonnegut than Mulder and Scully or Agents Doggett and Reyes.<br />As in \\"From the Corner of His Eye\\", Koontz presents a villian, Preston Maddoc, Leilani's stepfather, a villian of unspeakable evil.  To counterbalance this evil, as  he did in \\"Corner\\", Koontz introduces a character of good, \\"Curtis Hammond\\", whose wide eye innocence has him believing that Nun's Lake, Idaho, will be populated by bikini wearing, habit-donned nuns, water skiiing to their hearts delight as if in some Buzzy Berkeley 1930's musical.<br />Koontz adnits that, as in \\"Corner\\", he wrote this book while listening to music by Isaac Kamakawiwo'ole.  What influence that might have had, I don't know, but I found a much more emotional Koontz in these two books.  For example, as Micky comes to Leilani's rescue, Koontz writes, \\"Sensing a presence, Leilani looked over her shoulder, and her expression at the sight of a faithful friend was a joy that Micky would never forget if she lived to be 500 and if God chose to take all other memories from her in old age.  All other memories, He could have if that day came, but she would never give Him the sight of Leilani's face at this moment, for this alone would sustain her even in the hour of her death.\\"  Wow!<br />Religious overtones abound in this UFO adventure, and that may disturb some.  But, I liked this book because I think that Koontz wrote it for all those folks who have despair in their lives.  He tells us that for all those who have loneliness or lack purpose in life, you can find ones who will give you hope.  In this book, Koontz shows it through the dreams of a dog, believe it or not, but also tries to show us that we can all achieve it.  And once we do, it shall leave us all one door away from heaven, indeed.	2002-01-21

But, hey, that's ok.  That's not his lot in life.  Not everyone wants a thought provoking read or a novel with a message.  For those of us who prefer cheesburgers to filet mignon, for those who thought &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; was the best picture ever made, this is a novel for you.  End-to end, non-stop action.  No real time to stop and think.<br />A homeless man in Boston, an army major in California, and a teenager in Atlanta all succumb to a mysterious virus.  The controller of a vast pharmaceutical corporation discovers a virus in the jungles of Peru that has no antedote except for an antibody that appears in monkey blood.  So, he releases the virus on an unsuspecting world and, basically, blackmails humanity for the cure.  Enter Ludlum and Lynd's soon-to-be Covert One team.  Sounds exciting?  You bet it is.  Sure Ludlum has a lot of cartoon characters.  For instance, our hero says to the villan &quot;You're not a fool, just a ghoul.&quot; Bullets miss people's throats &quot;...by the thickness of a hair&quot;  but when they hit they &quot;...stab like searing ice&quot; (?)  Still, remember, this is make believe.  This is escapism.<br />So for those of us who want no moral, no message, no hidden meaning, let's grab that cheeseburger, put our feet up, put our minds in neutral, and enjoy the ride.	2001-12-29

Well, you'll just have to read this latest opus from the collective pens of Messrs. Stephen King and Peter Straub to understand.  Is it better than the book, &quot;The Talisman&quot;, which it is a sequel to?  Maybe so, maybe so.  By now most folks know the basic plot.  Jacky Sawyer, the 12-year old of &quot;Talisman&quot; fame is grown now and has &quot;retired&quot; from the LAPD to rural Wisconsin.  However, recent events in French Landing, Wisconsin, aren't about to let him stay retired.  A serial killer of children, the &quot;Fisherman&quot;, whose M.O. parallels one Albert Fish of New York for shear diabolic terror, has put all of Coulee County on edge.  Jack's new found friend from a previous case, Sheriff Dale Gilbertson, has asked - no begged - Jack to assist him in this investigation.  While the Fisherman kidnaps children and also enjoys a piece of each as an hoer douerve, it is the disppearance of young Ty Marshall that gets Jack into the case.  Ty is being held prisoner in that alternate reality known as &quot;The Territories&quot;, where Jack, as a 12 year old, had to venture to save his mother's life.  So, Jack and Dale, who are then joined by a handful of motorcycle-riding warrior poets, begin the quest for the Fisherman in earnest.  A secondary character, Henry, who is Dale's uncle and Jack's neighbor, serves as a blind DJ and radio personality (the best at baseball and swing music), and actually IDs the Fisherman.<br />While over 90% of this book take places in Wisconsin, the &quot;flipping&quot; to the Territories is handled in a such a smooth way it is almost like osmosis.  For those who cannot suspend their belief that one could be lying on the grass in one insatnce and merely get up in the Territories, King and Straub interject some characters and items from real life.  For example, Richie Sexson really does play for Milwaukee's &quot;Brew Crew&quot; and the Brewer's outfielder-first baseman really  does hit home runs.  For those who get their news and commentary on the internet, they will recognize the Drudge Report towards the end of the book.<br />I liked this book because it is reminiscent of two other classics of this genre, &quot;The Stand&quot; and &quot;It&quot;.  In both, a small group of people battle the demons in their own den of inequity.  Jack and the &quot;Sawyer gang&quot;, indeed, have to go to the Territories to fight the bad guys and save the world.  The ties to King's series &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; are there and, if one is real careful, you can find, in one sentence, a reference to Brautigan, who was the hero of book one in &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;.<br />Finally, the ending has a unique twist.  &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot; was never completed by Charles Dickens.  When that book was made into a Broadway play - a musical, no less - the audience was given an opportunity to chose the ending from a couple of options.  King and Straub do the same here.  After some 640 pages or so, they tell you you can stop with the happy ending.  If, however, you choose to go on and finish the last dozen or so pages, you will wind up with an ending that's, maybe, not so happy.  No matter which path you choose, if you ever read &quot;Bleak House&quot; by Dickens you'll never look at that classic in quite the same way.  Enjoy, for these two fellows did a really good job.	2001-11-21

Using a Manchurian Candidate premise, it even used that book as a source of control.  The husband and wife team that write together as &quot;John Case&quot; have given us a mind control story that uses mind control through technology as its premise.  Very similar, and yet very different, from the Koontz book.  In both cases, those under control have false memories, but in this book they even have false lives.  Imagine being convinced that you graduated from Brown and did post-grad work at Wisconsin, only to find out that you didn't.  Imagine going to a high school reunion where nobody knows who you are.  Then to find out that your own name - or what you believe to be your name - winds up on a tombstone years earlier.<br />Adrienne Cope investigates her sister Nico's suicide and it leads her to her sister's therapist, Jeffrey Duran.  Only, as she finds out, all that glitters is not gold as Jeff, you see, isn't really &quot;Jeff&quot;.  One things leads to another and Adrienne, after finding a rifle in her sister's &quot;effects&quot; and realizing that &quot;assasin&quot; might be one Nico's false personalities, teams up with Jeff and they go from Washington to New York to Florida to Switzerland in pursuit of the group that initiates this Syndrome.<br />Keep your seat belt buckled for non-stop action.  You'll learn some extra benefits along the way, such as how to get out of a strait jacket and what pieces of skull are like falling from the ceiling onto the financial pages of Neue Zurcher Zeitung.  You can't beat that!  Characterization is great, too.  You can see the change in both tone and language from Jeff Duran to Lew McBride.<br />So why not 5 stars?  I hate to be picky, but one character, when referring to the death of a gumshoe named Eddie Bonilla, refers to him as Bobby Bonilla.  Bobby B. is a baseball player, alive and well thank you, not a deceased fictional hit man.  Also, one of the characters, when talking about Pope John Paul I, says he was &quot;...poisoned after Vatican II&quot;.  Well, John Paul I died in 1979 while Vatican II took place in the early '60s. It's almost like my saying that my teenage daughter was born after the Korean War.  Still, such minor gaffs, and a somewhat blah ending, don't deter from a roaring good ride on the Syndrome express.  Enjoy.	2001-10-11

From the first Le Carre book I read, when I was in high school, &quot;The Spy Who Came in From the Cold&quot;, through &quot;A Small Town in Germany&quot;, the &quot;Smiley&quot; books, &quot;Little Drummer Girl&quot; and &quot;The Night Manager&quot;, to this one, Le Carre has a way with words and mood. So what if the Cold War, as we baby boomers knew it, is over? Le Carre has no lack of material.<br />The story of woman, murdered in Kenya. who got a little too close to a mega-pharmecutical conspiracy, &quot;Gardener&quot; introduces us to a set of characters all too believeable in this day and age. We follow the dead woman's husband, Justin Quayle (the Constant Gardener of the title), as he searchs across three continents in pursuit of his wife's killers and their motive. Even with a somewhat predictable ending, Le Carre holds us close in Justin's journey in search of justice. There are no James Bond &quot;gimmicks&quot; here and you will have to look elsewhere for the likes of Pussy Galore or SMERSH. But still, Le Carre, ever the consoment professional, can make your grocery list read like things that go bump in the night. And that's high praise indeed.	2001-09-03

She talked about science in science fiction. I had read two of her books, &quot;Doomsday Book&quot; and &quot;Lincoln's Dreams&quot;. Both are comparable to &quot;Passage&quot;, which, though classified as science fiction, could hold its own with most &quot;mainstream&quot; novels. Willis really does know her science, even if in this book there were a tad too many endomorphs for me. But that was not a problem. In the story, Joanna Lander undergoes experimental near death experiences (NDEs) that are induced by drugs in a controlled environment by Dr. Richard Wright, her research partner. Once she gets a clue as to what is going on and where she &quot;is&quot; in her NDEs, the book takes off like a rocket. Part mystery, part SF, there are no &quot;bad guys&quot; per se, only human beings, with all of their frailities, trying to find an answer that always seems just out of their collective reach.<br />Sure, there may be too many missed phone calls or too many complex hallways in the hospital, but the story moves, paced by well drawn, individual characters that you can't help but root for. Who wouldn't like Richard Wright (Dr. Right?), the dedicated Vielle, the ever patient and caring Kit, the precocious Maisie, and even the blabbering Ed of &quot;USS Yorktown&quot; fame? Only Mandrake, who comes off as an almost comic exaggeration, is poorly done.<br />And Willis knows her history as well, especially appreciated by those who saw the broadway musical &quot;Titanic&quot;, whose characters were real people, as opposed to the film version which was the cinematic equivalent of a Big Mac. Willis peppers the story with real people and actual events.<br />This book could have ended with about 100 pages to spare - hence my title - but it didn't. Looking back, that may have been a plus, not a negative. I believe that it was Harlan Ellison, who once said of science fiction, that &quot;90% of it is crap&quot; - and Ellison is a science fiction writer. However, Connie Willis is easily in the other 10%. Well done, again, Connie.	2001-08-29

No one can write a story that relates to his and my generation like him.  But, I have to admit that maybe I just missed the boat on this one.  It read to me like King had about 250 pages left in his ream of typing paper and knocked this thing off to finish the pack. A little girl gets lost in the woods; a little girl listens to Red Sox baseball on her radio; a little girl gets found.  While Trisha is a sweet and appealing character, the story, to my mind, has no substance and no filling.  Sort of like the literary equivalent of cheese whiz.  I think it would have come off better as a short story rather than a novel.<br />&quot;Tom Gordon&quot; is reminiscent, to my mind, of another King novel, &quot;Gerald's Game&quot;, which involves a wife who, after going through some sexual hijinks with her husband, witnesses ol' hubby having the &quot;Big One&quot; while she remains chained to their bed.  Kinky, yes. Enthralling, no.  Yet the similiarities between these two books are there.  200 pages of the wife chained up was the equivalent here of 200+ pages of Trisha lost in the woods.  It's not so much the lack of &quot;action&quot; in this book. There's no narrative to move the story along.  As in &quot;Gerald&quot;, King tries to insert an element of the supernatural that he brings in almost as an afterthought.  It's almost as if he felt he needed to do this to save the novel.  As a result, it comes across as if he isn't sure what kind of a story he wanted to write.  I heard someone say, &quot;'The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon' would make an excellent made-for-TV movie.  That should be condemnation enough, right there.<br />And, lastly, as a Yankee fan, I have to disagree with King.  No way Tom Gordon strikes out Bernie Williams and Paul O'Neill back-to-back with a high hard one.  Sorry Stephen.	2001-08-10

These ladies are not the North Street Irregulars or Charlie's Angels.  They are tough, level-headed women who use their brains and think outside of the box.  A homocide detective (Lindsey), a reporter (Cindy), a medical examiner (Claire), and a D.A. (Jill) join forces to track down one of the worst serial killers this side of Hannibal Lector: someone who murders newlyweds.  And I mean brand new newlyweds, for one couple is murdered in the bridal suite of a posh San Francisco hotel, another in the men's room (that's right) at their wedding reception at the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame.<br />These ladies, each successful in a male-dominated profession, gather together at a San Francisco watering hole and play ideas off of one another in an attempt to catch this fiend.  They, literally, start with nothing but piece together snippets of details all the way through the case until an arrest is made.  But - bingo! - we know Patterson and suddenly nothing is as it seems.  Or is it?  Do they have the right person or don't they?  Patterson, using his trademark short, quick chapters, has us hopping this way and that.  He also mixes first person narratives (Lindsey) with third person narratives (the killer).  Patterson is a master at this and the pace really flies.  But, who is the killer?  Is everything that they have run down devastatingly wrong?  There's the pleasure in this game, leading to a mystery that really moves.  Also, I have to say that Patterson, himself, does an outstanding job of writing from a woman's perspective in the first person of Lindsey.<br />The back flap of the book says that this will be a new series.  Good.  However, I have to wonder if all of the original ladies will be back for the sequels.  You see, this book opens with one of them holding a gun to the side of her own head.  If there is one weakness in this book, in my opinion, it is Patterson's attempt to make the main characters a little too sympathetic to the reader.  Still, it is a good read.  So, what's the worse thing anyone has ever done?  Believe me, in Patterson's excellent hands, you don't want to know.	2001-08-09

Just peruse &quot;The Body&quot; or &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; or even &quot;Misery&quot; to see why I say that.  In this big book, that includes two novel length stories and three shorter ones, he demonstrates that again.  Sure, the first story, &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot;, features some strange looking leftovers from the cast of the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series.  Ted Brautigan, who helps the main character, Bobby and his friends, get through life in the early '60s, will be featured in a new &quot;Dark Tower&quot; novel.  Ted has healing powers ala John Coffey of &quot;Green Mile&quot; fame.<br />But, to my mind, it is the second story, the full length novel &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;, that really steals the show.  The title doesn't refer to love and kisses on some lost continent but rather to the card game and it's role in the lives of young people at the Valhalla of their lifetime, college, with the shadow of Viet Nam hovering over everything they do.  Kurt Vonnegut said that college teaches us how we should have behaved in high school.  I think college is a dry run for life.  I loved this story because King had me in the palm of his hand relating so well to the main character, Pete.  I'm the same age as King, so if it was autobiographical for him, I'm right there with him. I even had all the Phil Ochs albums he writes about. I partook of the weekly and nightly hearts games.  I had a roomate my freshman year who went from the Deans List to academic probation because of those devil cards. As a geologist, I am amused and mildly miffed that it was geology that was the course Pete struggles with.  When Pete returns home on Thanksgiving break with the self promise to buckle down academically and, regarding his draft board, has one foot in a rice patty and one foot on a banana peel, his mom reminds him again of Nam. &quot;Boys are dying over there&quot;.  My mother said the same thing to me in 1969.  And like Pete, there was a Carol in my life as well.  This whole book hits home because anyone who went to college in the '60s will relate to it.<br />While each story in the book may be read independently, if you read them in order, you will see what happens to selective characters throughout each of them.  I liked it because the book takes you from the innocence of young childhood to a generation that maybe had to grow up way before its time. &quot;Heavenly Shades of Night are Falling&quot;, the last story, will bring some closure for some of the characters.  But King shows us that sometimes the real horror comes not from the devils he and other authors make up, but rather from the devils we know.  A great book.	2001-07-19

Her main character, Tempe Brennan, splits her time between the Laboratoire de Medicine Legale de Montreal (and my french never sounded better!) and the University of North Carolina - Charlotte.  Though a forensic anthropologist, the obvious comparisons to Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta are almost inevitable.  But, to my mind of late, Tempe brings much more to the table.  She is not as whiney as our Kay and the secondary charcaters are much more believable and founded in reality than the stereotypes who support Dr. Kay these days.<br />This novel runs parallel plots with the excavation of a long dead nun who is up for beatification, an arson induced house fire, and the disappearance of a college assistant, that takes Tempe from Montreal to the Carolinas.  This all leads her to the pursuit of a cult and, through the course of the novel, gives us some flicker of insight into what can get people to sign up for places like Jonestown.  Like her discussions on pathology, Ms. Reichs doesn't use the vast amount of material she has acquired about cults to shock us, but, rather, uses it to move the pace along quite well.<br />We also see more insight into Tempe herself than we did in the first book.  We gain (better) insight into her relationship with her sister - both as a sibling and as a rival.  And we also get a better focus on her relationship with her daughter.  Once the story moves to the Carolina's, we see, dare I say, even a more sexy Tempe.  This all makes her character much more believable and maybe much more vulnerable.  More like you and me and so we tend (and want) to root for her.<br />So, why not 5 stars?  I found the exacavation of the nun fascinating and, quite frankly, was waiting for it to be tied in neatly with the cult.  That never came to be.  Still, this was a very good read and held my interest through out.  The kind of story you read by a roaring fire with a brandy or maybe sitting under an umbrella on the beach.  But, if you read it on an island off of South Carolina, you might find yourself looking over your shoulder.  Kathy Reichs, she's that good.	2001-07-13
US	50247856	RBX369DQ47D1P	0246118547	11251499	Pay Any Price	Books	5	4	4	N	N	&quot;JFK&quot; Mets &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;	Ted Allbeury is easily the best kept secret in espionage fiction.  A former officer in the British Intelligence Corps who worked in counterintelligence, he brings hands on experience into all of his novels.  And this one is an absolute delight!  There is no real hero per se.  Instead we are exposed to a couple of CIA hypnosis experts, Symons and Peterson, both of whom have more involvment than we care to know about in the two Kennedy assasinations, and a British operative named Boyd who is on assignment to the CIA.  Boyd actually comes across their dirty dealings when the two experts, who are stashed away in a safe house in northern Britain, use hypnosis on a British soldier and a female civilian, who is a former exotic dancer now turned talent agency director.  Both of these unknowing victims  are used as assasins for the Brits in Northern Ireland.  They are each hypnotized with multiple personalities and commit these deeds without their &quot;normal&quot; selves even being aware.  The only negative I came away with was, as the reader, we don't get to witness the actual sanctions on the Northern Ireland victims.  But Allbeury keeps the action moving at such a fast pace, we hardly notice.<br />Also, he gives us insight into the kinds of people who would be involved in these types of sanctions and the rationale that they use to wipe away any guilt.  His dialogue is biting.  For example, one character puts it in perespective by saying &quot;I don't mean 'playing God' - any totalitarian dictator can do that.  Being God is different.&quot;<br />Finally, leave it to Allbeury to give us that little twist of irony with regard to things to come.  When talking about the Kennedys, one character says that they played the role of &quot;the guys in the white hats&quot; and really belonged in Hollywood.  He then says, &quot;One of these days, the country will do it in reverse.  They'll go straight to Hollywood and pick a guy who plays the right kind of parts and make him president.&quot;  As they used to say on &quot;The A Team&quot;, don't you love when a plan comes together? And Allbeury's does, very well indeed.	2001-06-15

The similarities with this book are there - girls flirting with witchcraft, an anti-hero who becomes isolated in his own community yet at the center of the story, a justice system that shows itself to be less than ideal.<br />Without giving too much away, Jack St. Bride is a convicted sex offender who, upon moving to Salem Falls, has to report himself to the police under Megan's Law, an actual statute.  Unfortunately for ol' Jack, even if he is a decent soul on the inside and innocent of the original charge, his charm and boyish good looks, ala a young Redford, make him a marked man.  He gets a job in a local diner and begins an affair with Addie, the female owner.  Still, things would have been ok if it weren't for a sweet young thing named Gillian, who not only poisons her own father with pills from his own pharmeceutical company, but then seduces our anti-hero Jack, to boot!  And just to compund matters, Jack, inadvertently, runs into a group of the local gals running stark naked around a bonfire while celebrating a witch (wiccan?) festival.  One thing leads to another and guess who is accused of Gillian's rape?  And this is only half of the story. The trial consumes us the rest of the way. Arthur Miller would have been proud.<br />I liked the setting and the way the story unfolds.  It would have been so easy to allow the witchcraft element to take over, but instead, it remains as a mist that envelopes a story that turns into a mystery, a romance, and a court room drama.  The characters however, outside of Jack and Addie, are somewhat cardboard.  Jack's own mother is too stereotypical and the attorneys and the private investigator read like I could have written them.  Still, to my mind, it is the relationship between Jack and Addie that saves the day.  It is somewhat tender and, at times almost innocent.  I would have given this book another star except that it seemed, because Jack and Addies's relationship is done so well, as the story unfolds, it can't quite make up it's mind whether it is a love story or a court room drama.  Still, if you're heading to Nags Head or the Cape, this is a good one to take with you.	2001-06-01

As a &quot;Baby Boomer&quot;, I can recall the race to keep up with the Soviets in the inital forays into outer space.  I can remember Sputnik, &quot;Mutnik&quot; (the one with the dog) and all the other &quot;-utniks&quot;.  I recall that Explorer was a real turning point for the American space program. One in which we really crossed the Rubicon in the space race.  The pressure on the U.S. was enormous.  The launch of Explorer was delayed a couple of times. This latest effort by Ken Follett gives a &quot;what if&quot; scenario to what might have been.<br />&quot;Code to Zero&quot; is maybe a little short on depth of plot, but leave it to Follett to pack in the suspense and keep it moving.  The flashbacks, as Luke works on regaining his memory, tell a nice tale in themselves.  They show the idealism of college kids in the early 1940s and how that changes into bloodthirstiness in the early 1960s.  It seemed like &quot;spook&quot; became the occupation du jour for these folks.  And maybe that was a bit of a reach.  One strong point, to my mind however, was the characterization.  Anthony is completely Machiavellian as the villan.  I especially enjoyed - and rooted for - the relationship between Bille and Luke.  Maybe it was that naivete that the good guys should always win and nice guys will always get the girl - neither of which is necessarily true.  Still, I think their relationship was touching the way it was told in flashback and, in the present, it was the hinge that the book turned on.  As a scientist, I also have to tell you that I found the little snippets about the rocket, that Follett stuck at the begining of each chapter, down right fascinating.<br />Still, there were, shall we say, some inconsistencies.  For example, I live in Northern Virginia and I can honestly say that I have never heard of the local police force in the Nation's Capital referred to as the Washington Police (It's the D.C. Police).  Also, and this was more grevious to me, I can remember sitting up in July 1969 and watching the adventure that was Apollo 11 - not 1968 as Follett sets it in his epilogue.  In July 1968, the Nation was mourning RFK and Dr. King.  Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins weren't even known.  Still, while this was not Follett's best, it wasn't his worst either, and I think it would make a good beach read.	2001-04-13

A conflict of good vs. evil that, in parts, is reminiscent of &quot;The Stand&quot; by Stephen King.  Representing evil is one of the truest bad boys in recent literature.  Enoch &quot;Junior&quot; Cain pitches his own wife off of a tower in the Oregon forest for reasons known only to him at first. We see inside of him as he fantasizes on how women must find him irresisitible.  He uses this rationalization when he rapes the teenage daughter of a minister.  His dispicable series of murder that follow only add to his abhorent nature.  When a series of events convinces him that someone called Bartholomew is or will become his arch-enemy, he assumes that Bartholomew is the son of the girl he has raped and he begins a quest to find and destroy him.<br />Bartholomew, or &quot;Barty&quot;, is not this illegitimate offspring, but is one of the forces of good to counterbalance Bad Bad Junior Cain.  Barty is the son of the &quot;Pie Lady&quot;, a truly beautiful person who gives him his sense of values.  Because Junior is such a bad dude - reminiscnet to me of Randall Flagg of &quot;the Stand&quot; fame - Koontz introduces another force of good to balance him out.  Celestina is the sister of the girl raped by Cain, who adopts her offspring, Angel.  The story is told as three plots swirling around each other - Cain, Barty, and Celestina/Angel.  Koontz deftly alternates chapters to keep the show moving and the results are a very good read.<br />Change and counterbalance are the themes here.  From when Barty loses his sight to regaining it (to losing it again).  The detective in this story is not, to my mind, a likeable fellow at first, but once he winds up in a lake, his character development experiences an epiphany and he becomes one of the more moving individuals in the tale.  Almost a rebirth, if you will. Koontz's story shows us the despicablility of evil on the one hand and yet the true beauty of goodness on the othter.<br />The title of the book comes from the answer to the question how can God watch over all of us - the answer being that He sees all of us from the corner of His eye.  The spititual context is not lost here.  Look at all of the Biblical names:  Enoch, Bartholomew, Celestina, Cain, even Angel.  The evil is dark here but Koontz shows us that the goodness we have in ourselves can be our last full measure.	2001-04-12

It was about two teenage girls, both of whom were pregnant, both of whom were virgins.  One carries the Savior in her womb, the other the spawn of Satan.  Get the picture?  It was one of Patterson's earlier efforts and it read like one.  &quot;Cradle and All&quot; is the re-birth, if you will, of that earlier novel and the difference, to my mind, is light years.<br />Patterson brings this early effort up to speed and modernizes it.  This one contains mentions of the internet and even 'N Sync has a reference.  But what he also brings is a more polished style of writing and that, I think, is all to the better for the reader.  Sure, the story is more along the lines of a made for TV movie, but Patterson uses his usual bag of tricks - short, distinct chapters, lots of dialogue, and many changes of scene - to move the plot along.  Anne Fitzgerald is a former nun now turned private eye.  She is asked by the Cardinal of the Archdiocese of Boston to investigate, Kathleen, one of the virgins.  She ends up going from being Kathleen's investigator to being Kathleen's protector.  She does meet the other virgin, Colleen, who lives in Ireland (natch), but Colleen is investigated more by Father Rossetti, a priest from the Vatican, who is told the third and final secret of Fatima.  And that's what get's everyone running.  You know that you are in for a good time when the Cardinal asks Anne two questions right in a row&quot; &quot;Do you believe in God?&quot; followed by &quot;Do you still carry a gun?&quot;. Oh boy!<br />Patterson adds an epilogue to this story that tends to tie the loose ends up a little better and the secret of &quot;Who's who&quot; or, perhaps, &quot;Who isn't&quot;, is somewhat revealed with a clue early in the book.  Still, Patterson goes great guns withthe action.  This is a good read for a rainy saturday afternoon.  It has everything anyone would want: action, intrigue, supernatural elements, mystery, romance, cradle, and all.  Enjoy.	2001-02-02
US	50247856	R13GHFOJ3ZYSZO	0812545478	683578113	Dawn Song	Books	2	2	4	N	N	Anne Rice Does the Book of Job	Having both pros and cons about Michael Marano's first effort, if I could give it  2 1/2 stars I would because that's where I saw it - right down the middle.<br />On the positive side, I found it to be an extremely interesting concept, reminiscent of the Book of Job because here are two &quot;spiritual&quot; (?) beings watching humans deal with what is being thrown at them from outside their own realm.  Two demons battle for dominion on earth.  I found the characterization to be exceptional, containing the kind of detail that usually is the domain of Anne Rice.  Of the main characters, there is Lawrence, a clerk in a bookstore who has come to terms with his own homosexuality, but not his father's death; Paul, a teacher founded in reality who, at one point, encourages a student teacher to fight the good fight, and then a few pages later, decides to quit teaching himself, and finally; Ed Sloane, our resident theological anti-hero.  All of these people are drawn in great detail.  Also, I liked how Marano does for the west end of Boston - Kennemore Square, Copley Place, Fenway Park - what Rice does for New Orleans.  Namely, he paints it as a very dark location.  Never in this book did I ever get the feeling that the sun was shining.  However, though this tapestry is dark, it is, at times, quite beautiful.<br />Still, as the one armed economist might say, &quot;on the other hand&quot;, there is no force of good in this book.  I think the reader needs that in this kind of story.  There are no good guys, no guys in white hats, no Lone Ranger to save the town and hence humanity.  Rooting for one of the demons over the other doesn't offer much either.  Belial, the Unbowed One, operates through his daughter, the succubus, who &quot;heals&quot; people by devouring their souls and then drops pieces of them (the souls) into hell.  Nice touch.  The other, Leviathan, the Enfolded One, is no prize himself.  A sort of reptilian worm, he pulls humanity's chain by initiating events like the Gulf War.  Rooting for one these guys over the other is akin to either being garroted or hung with an electric rope:  the end result is pretty much the same.  Also, I did not find this book particularily scary.  We should not confuse slasher-type gore with true horror.  For example, one of the demons possess one of the characters and he waits - in the bathroom, no less - to do in a young couple.  He waylays them with a mallet, whose craftmanship, I might add, he complains about in the previous chapter. He then decapitates them, spells words with their blood, and then carries their heads around in a plastic bag full of fruit and vegetables.  Gross, for sure.  Scary, not really.<br />One thing I did wish Marano had more of is dialogue.  I feel dialogue really moves a story along.  If one doubts me, I would suggest that they pick up something by Ed McBain or Elmore Leonard.  I spent too many times with this book re-reading descriptive paragraphs because I couldn't retain what was written.  Still, I would have to say that I would like to see more by Marano because this was, after all, a first novel.  His knowledge of medieval history and religion should be able to pay better dividends down the road.	2001-01-19

Ordinarily, I don't cheer the demise of characters in a book, but I thought that this first Kay Scarpetta novel in the &quot;post-Benton Wesley&quot; era would be a throwback to Patricia Cornwell's first novels in this series.  The premise was excellent: a body is discovered in the bowels of a cargo ship with the words &quot;loup garou&quot;.  Any baby boomer who ever watched Zacherley on &quot;Shock Theater&quot; or any generation X-er who ever saw &quot;Elvira&quot; could tell you that &quot;loup garou&quot; means werewolf.  A case involving a serial killer that takes our heroine Kay to the shores of Europe and the office of interpol.  Our intrigue-juices were just salivating.  Save your appetite, my friend, there's no meal here.<br />I did not like this book because the plot line that I mentioned only accounts for about 1/4 of the book.  The remainder of it depicts the deterioration and assasination (almost) of the characters that aided Kay Scarpetta so well throughout this series.  This is done through a weak and stereotypical subplot involving new deputy chief Diane Bray.  Kay Scarpetta is no longer the extremely intelligent, razor sharp medical examiner who finds the narrowest thread of a clue that helps catch the bad guy.  She is now a shell of what she once was.  It started  a few novels ago, but she hits rock bottom in this one.  Benton Wesley was a sharp, intelligent, well educated, well dressed, FBI guru. Think Efrem Zimbalist on the inside, maybe Harrison Ford on the outside.  Yet when he and Kay became lovers their characters became completely unbelievable.  &quot;Oh, Kay, we shouldn't do this&quot; &quot;Oh Benton, I know we shouldn't&quot;.  Then they promptly jump in the sack like two alley cats.  They're both too smart for this.  So, I thought with Benton out of the picture (hence my title), things might go back to the way they were.  No such luck.  Pete Marino used to be the street smart cop whose blue collar, Bogart-like personality, used to playbeautifully with the clean, well educated Scarpetta. Not anymore.  Marino is now an overweight, stagnant, cardiological time bomb.  He has no creativity and his character is falling onto the junk pile of life. Lucy, Kay's niece, has been reduced as well.  While struggling with her own sexual identifiaction, Lucy has turned from an intelligent young woman into a gal who would &quot;out-macho&quot; any guy this side of John Wayne.  She is a helicopter pilot, computer jock, ammunitions expert, and she packs a revolver in her shoe.  Come on.  Still, Ms. Cornwell has an intriguing character in Lucy, but she insists on hitting the reader over the head with a &quot;lesbianism is ok&quot; mallet as Lucy wrestles with her sexual orientation.  I want to say, ok, already, I agree with you.  Everytime this happens, I can hear Jerry Seinfeld saying, &quot;.......not that there's anything wrong with that.&quot;<br />If you're new to Kay Scarpetta, skip this one.  Go to Patrica Cornwell's first novels in this series.  Meet the Kay Scarpetta of &quot;Postmortem&quot; and &quot;All That Remains&quot;.  I liked her (and those novels) a lot better.  If your library is short on those books then try an author named Kathy Reichs, who will introduce you to the &quot;Canadian Kay Scarpetta&quot;, Tempe Brennan.

But, I guess I just missed the boat on this one.<br />The success of the Good Friday Agreement is being threatened by a new terrorist group and the current British Prime Minister requests that the U.S. President appoint a heavyweight to the Court of St. James to show U.S. support for this agreement.  Senator Douglas Cannon, a political rival of the current administration, gets the appointment and since he is Michael Osbourne's father in law, we know that the former hero of &quot;Mark of the Assassin&quot; will be lured back into the web of dirty deeds and operatives.  Even the &quot;Assassin&quot; from &quot;Mark of the Assassin&quot; returns.  What more could one ask for.<br />Unlike many, I thought that the first half of the book was extremely well done.  Especially where Silva lays the seeds for the problems in Northern Ireland and introduces his new paramilitary &quot;bad guys&quot; (and &quot;bad gals&quot;).  But, with the introduction of a super-secret cabal known only as &quot;The Society&quot;, whose directors are interested in world domination and control from an economic as well as a political/military level, I think he starts to lose it.  First of all, the identity of the U.S. delegate to this group is a piece of cake to figure out.  Then, &quot;October&quot;, the assassin from the second book, performs a hit for the Mossad and Osbourne can recognize him from his hand (?).  The Society itself - that world domination thing, again - is vintage Robert Ludlum.  Even the three word title is downright Ludlumesque.  And having Osbourne and Jean Paul Delarouche (&quot;October&quot;) join forces to save the world.......well, let's say I double checked a couple of times just to makesure whose name was on the cover.<br />A number of authors of this genre have had their first couple of books be their best work and later novels become the literary equivalent of popcorn.  I think that Silva is too good a writer to allow that to happen.  But, I look forward to his next novel, just to make sure.	2001-01-02

It has something for everyone.  You will learn more about gene therapy than you can shake a stick at (the Robin Cook connection) and you will be engrossed by the Brotherhood of the Second Coming, a religious international cabal, while not focusing on world domination, but which definitely has plans for a new world order - vintage Robert Ludlum.  The book even has a 3-word title, which is a Ludlum trademark.<br />Dr. Tom Carter seeks the perfect gene to help save his daughter Holly from impending brain cancer. His pursuit causes him to cross paths with the Brotherhood, who originally try to have him killed.  The Brotherhood has their own assassins with colorful names like Gomorrah and Nemesis.  One of the assassins is even a woman.  The Brotherhood, originally formed by Lazarus, is awaiting and has evidence of the Second Coming.<br />But because this book trys to be all things to all people, that turns out to be a shortcoming.  There is the medical thriller aspect, the hunt for the gene, there is the international intrigue of the assassin tracking Carter down, and there is the religious overtones of the impending Second Coming, reminiscent of the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series.  If Cordy could have concentrated on just one of these venues, he might have had a better book.  Still a good first try.  However, if you would like to see what this story would be like after Cordy had a couple of novels under his belt, try &quot;The Genesis Code&quot; by John Case.	2000-12-27

Anyone reading this book will be reminded of Feinstein's earlier work, &quot;A Civil War&quot; which chronicled an entire football season for both Army and Navy, finalizing in the Army-Navy game.  From the opening moments of this book, where Patriot League champ, Lafayette, is preparing to meet nationally ranked Temple in the opening round of the NCAA tournament, we know we are about to begin a special journey.<br />In this book we meet different heroes.  We meet Don DeVoe, who after a successful career coaching winning teams at Tennesssee and Florida, now runs a successful program at Navy where he turns in 20-victory seasons with players who would be walk ons at these other schools; we meet Ralph Willard, a former Rick Pitino apprentice who, after a run at bigger schools like Western Kentucky and Pittsburgh, returned to his alma mater, Holy Cross, and now coachs for the fun of it; and, finally, we meet Adrian Foyle, a player recruited on the national level, who chooses Colgate because of the ACADEMICS.<br />&quot;The Last Amateurs&quot; is a refreshing look at collegiate athletics the way they were meant to be.

Written almost documentarily, like the Blair Witch Project, it is also abstract, much like an Andy Warhol creation.  I understand it took about 10 years to write and I can believe it for once Danielewski got up from the word processor, he probably had to re-read about 10 pages to remind him just where he was in this maze of an epic.  The story, for those who don't know it already, involves a old blind man, a tattoo shop employee, and a mad woman who narrate a story within a story about a house whose dimensions on the outside don't quite match the dimensions on the inside.  If anyone has read &quot;The House&quot; by Bentley Little, it is reminiscent of that novel with its shifting series of hallways and labyrinths that require adventurers to string lights and use cables like mountain climbers to keep in touch with each other.  The family that owns the home will find an unspeakable horror at the end of all of these hallways.<br />The story is actually pieced together from differing accounts by the main characters.  At first blush, one could be intimidated by the sheer size of the book (over 700 pages).  But then, as one flips through it, one may say, &quot;I can read this over the weekend&quot; because many of the pages have only one word on them. (Some of the pages have words backwards and upside down - but that is all part of the journey).  Don't be fooled by the sparcity of words on some of the pages because, more often than not, the story isn't so much told in the narrative as it is in the footnotes.  And there's the rub, as Shakespeare would say.<br />And after you finish the 700+ pages?  You may want to read it again because like the house it describes, you may not see the same things a second time.	2000-12-27

He simply &quot;eliminates the competition&quot;.  We might all think about it in our darker fantasies, but Burke goes ahead and does it.<br />I read this book because it was constantly referenced in the Amazon.com reviews of another Westlake book (&quot;The Hook&quot;).  Both books have similarities and differences that abound.  The secondary charcters are stronger in &quot;The Hook&quot; than here.  We really don't dwell all that much on Burke's wife and even less so on his kids.  Yet, like in &quot;The Hook&quot;, there is a sense of desperation on the part of the main characters.  In both cases, the action is fast paced and we find ourselves hungrily turning the pages.<br />So, why not 5 stars? A couple of reasons:  When Burke's son is brought up on charges of breaking into a software store and the police search his house, they come across the resumes he has collected.  The police are already investigating a few of the deaths by this time, yet they fail to make the connection.  I wanted to shake Detective Burton because he can't seem to put 2+2 together.  He ends up, like the detective in &quot;The Hook&quot;, as being almost a wasted character.  Some of the murders committed by Burke are committed in a public venue, especially the first one where he shoots a man at his own mailbox and one of the later ones where a person is bludegeoned to death in a parking lot.  Yet, no one sees anything.  Still, this book has a certain quality, if that is the right word, where we find ourselves rooting for this dark underdog and that, on its own,is reason enough to read &quot;The Ax&quot; and enjoy!	2000-10-05

Intense, fast paced, and yet with a sense of humor, is the best way to<br />describe this latest effort by Nelson De Mille.  For those who liked<br />John Corey, the sarcastic, yet able-minded hero of &quot;Plum<br />Island&quot;, you'll be glad to know he is back in this quick moving<br />thriller....<br />Some may not like the viewpoints alternating between<br />first-person and third-person in every other chapter, but I think it<br />helps move the story along as it puts you in the Lion's frame of mind.<br />Forget Grisham, Clancy and those guys for DeMille is at the top of his<br />game in this one.<br />So, why not 5 stars?  Well, the FBI and CIA<br />characters appeared a little too stereo-typical for my tastes.  They<br />all shouldn't be like Scully and Mulder, but they all shouldn't be<br />stuff shirts either.  ...  And, lastly, the ending, or lack thereof,<br />begs for a sequel.  Still these are minor comments.  To close on a<br />positive note, I can only hope that DeMille is working on that sequel<br />as I type this, for this was his best effort so far.  Enjoy.	2000-09-23

And, sure, style, prose, and writing technique have  changed greatly.  So maybe it doesn't &quot;flow&quot; like some of today's  better writers.  But remember, this started out as a novella and then was  expanded to book length, so there will be some disjointing.  Also  rememeber, however, that Jack Williamson remains a giant in the field of  science fiction and horror.<br />This is novel of lycanthropy, but not of  lycanthropy.  It is a novel about evil, pure and simple.  While Will's  jumping into that &quot;relationship&quot; of evil with April is, at first,  a little far fetched, it gets the story going.  What is the secret of the  archaeological dig?  We don't find out until the end.  A combination of  Wagner the Wehr-Wolf meets Indiana Jones, for pure escapism, it has  something for every one.  I can picture the movie being made starring Kurt  Russell! It even cries for a sequel as we find out, as Douglas Winter  mentions in the prologue, that the answer of why there is evil lies within.	2000-08-31
US	50247856	RDCID3P2QIMJY	0892965886	539266918	The Hook	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Maybe He Should have called it &quot;Side Show&quot;..........	....because the 2 main characters are, figuratively, joined at the hip.  By now everyone knows this is the story of Bryce Proctorr, a best selling  author who has writers block, and the &quot;deal he strikes with the  devil&quot; involving Wayne Prentice, an author who has books and ideas but  is dropping off of the charts because he can't get published.  The  solution:  Bryce turns in one of Wayne's novels as his own and they both  split the $1+ million advance.  The &quot;hook&quot;:  Bryce is going  through a bitter divorce and doesn't want to split his half of the proceeds  with his estranged wife Lucie.  Hence, Wayne has to &quot;ice&quot; Lucie.  This all takes place rather early on in the book and the bulk of the tale  is really about how Bryce and Wayne become each other.  The story moves  quickly, the plot is good, and the book is a real good read that holds your  attention.  That's why I gave it 4 stars.  However, the main characters,  Bryce and Wayne are so very predictable and whiney you want to shake them.  This might be one of the &quot;false notes&quot; that Peter M. talks about.<br />I found the auxiliary characters, particularily the women, to be much  stronger.  Bryce, for one, appears to be drawn toward strong women.  Certainly Lucie has the fire and passion that he seems to lack.  His ex-  wife, Ellen, comes across much stronger than him when he  &quot;confesses&quot; (his confession was a real reach for me).  Even his  lover, Isabelle, leaves him.  Wayne gets off no easier with his companion.  Susan, his wife, at first blush seems to be somewhat timid and not the risk  taker.  The way she pushes him to apply for a college teaching position is  a safe move.  But, once she becomes aware of his involvement, she turns  right away into the stronger of the two and a bit more Machiavellian.  In  the end, the way Wayne becomes Bryce, she actually becomes Lucie.<br />While  this is a little darker than &quot;High Adventure&quot; or &quot;The Hot  Rock&quot;, it is fast paced and yet does have it's pitfalls.  Wayne's  method of murder was a little unbelievable, to say the least, in the way it  was planned and brought about (or I should say the lack thereof in  planning).  Nothing comes of the detective's investigation, so he is a  useless character. And the ending, while somewhat inevitable, appeared  hurried to me.  Still, all in all, on a long flight from DC or NY to LA,  this is a great read and the perfect book for the trip.  Enjoy.	2000-08-23

We'll find out about it at the chilling, yet inevitable, end of this taught psychological thriller.  In the  meantime, the eerie trip to the climax is like a carnival ride, slow to  start out but building up speed to an exhilarting ending.  Larry is a  seventy-ish bloke living in Ethel Duck's boarding house close to 43 years.  He befriends a young college student, Amanda Tyson - Mandy, my love  to  &quot;good ol' Larry&quot;.  Through each chilling chapter he moves to  possess her.  At first, I thought there was a lack of dialogue, but further  reading shows that there is tons of dialogue - it's just all in Larry's  head.<br />Is Larry really evil or is he really just a victim of self  deception?  Is he being polite by leaving cigarettes in her apartment?  When he hears from Mandy that she walks to college, he checks to find out  that it is 3 miles away - just because he is interested, right?  One night,  when Mandy doesn't show up to join him, he blames his brother-in-law Harry  for showing up instead.  On the one hand, he says, &quot;Larry Mann is not  the sort to go poking his nose anywhere that he's not wanted&quot;.  Yet,  in the next paragraph he sneaks into her apartment looking for  clues.<br />Once Mandy's lover, Francis, appears on the scene, Larry will pull  out all of the stops to keep her.  Here the story takes a darker turn.  When Mandy receives a letter from her mother apologizing for a family  transgression, Larry not only opens it and blames Ethel Duck's snooping on  the reason Mandy would write to her mother in the first place.  After  buying a Christmas present for Mandy, he buys one FROM her to him, just the  same way he leaves cards from his estranged daughter, June, for himself.  Self deception?  Or something darker?  If you like Ruth Rendell, you'll  love this first effort by Penelope Evans.  Instead of fearing things that  go bump in the night, you'll wind up fearing people that say, &quot;How  goes it old kid?&quot;	2000-08-22
US	50247856	R139YZN6M6CH5V	074516238X	872631324	The Lake of Darkness	Books	4	24	25	N	N	Not Inspector Wexford	Martin Urban wins a tidy sum at the football pools and, since he is not financially destitute, decides to share his good fortune with those less  fortunate than himself.  Martin, however, will learn that no good deed goes  unpunished. One of his benefactors is a fellow named Finn, who, while being  the son of a friend of Martin's mother, is also no stranger to receiving  strange bundles of cash - for &quot;services rendered&quot;.  There is also  Francesca, who is Martin's love interest, if that's the right word.  These  three form an eternal triangle, only they don't know it.  For you see, once  Finn receives Martin's sum, he's not quite sure who he is suppose to  kill.<br />This book is reminiscent of Elmore Leonard in that it is not a  mystery per se - not Inspector Wexford - but more of a crime novel, a  psychological treatise where the characters dictate the action.  While  neither Martin, Finn, nor Francesca evokes our sympathy, their interwining  does.  The plot is woven among these three much like a loom.<br />The strength  of the book is Rendell's emphasis on the psychological make up of her main  characters as well as her ability to draw them into relationships without  their necessarily being in the same scene.  I gave the book 4 stars and not  5 because this could have been a bigger story.  However, if you're looking  for a mystery, go read Sherlock Holmes.  There's more deeper psychological  angst here.	2000-08-16
