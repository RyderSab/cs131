This was my husband's favorite book from his childhood; since his copy was very worn, I bought a new copy for him to share with our son.<br /><br />My son loves the book--he reaches for it and picks it up, and when we're reading to him he grabs for all the pictures; he's very interested!<br /><br />I've never been the world's biggest Richard Scarry fan, but this book is way better than I thought it would be, too--it's so funny.  I love the frightened parking meter and other funny details, and finding Goldbug on each set of pages can be quite challenging.<br /><br />Cars and Trucks and Things That Go is an entertaining book that can hold the whole family's attention!	2005-10-11

We just got this book from family friends, and my son (who is almost eight months old) loves it.  It's probably his favorite book.  And, luckily enough, I love it too!<br /><br />Emily is a realistic-looking cow who cannot moo, but we learn from the pictures that she CAN do things like climb trees--looking perfectly natural all the while!<br /><br />The story is fairly predictable, but the pictures really make it something special.

The characters are endearing, and their interspecies friendship is beautiful.<br /><br />The use of rhythm and rhyme in the text is really great.  All too often, rhyming books for children are cheesy and cliche; this one is fresh and attractive.  It even held my seven-month-old's attention when I read it to him for the first time yesterday!<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend Bear Wants More.  I can't wait to read Bear Stays Up for Christmas!	2005-09-23

This book is refreshing because, rather than focusing on the farm animals or pets covered in so many children's books, it introduces desert animals and their actions.  The text, which consists of simple sentences with descriptive verbs, fits well with the pleasant illustrations.  All in all, this is a great addition to the board book genre.	2005-09-22

I gave the subject of my sister-in-law's baby shower gifts quite a bit of thought.  \\"What books would be good for her baby?\\" I wondered.  Since she has two exuberant dogs, I wanted to get something about a dog--preferably a large dog--and I suddenly remembered the Alexandra Day books my mom was so excited about when they were new.<br /><br />I was pleased that the Good Dog, Carl board book was available because the story is a good introduction to Carl's antics and because the board book format would be excellent for an infant.  What I wasn't expecting was the reaction the book got at the shower--everyone seemed to recognize the book, and at least one person said, \\"I wish I'd thought of that!\\"<br /><br />I was really pleased with the results of the gift, and I would recommend the book.  Living in a two-bedroom apartment with a roommate's Great Dane turned me into less of a dog fan than I used to be, but even I like to check out all the adventures Carl has with his young charge.  I'd forgotten all the beautiful detail; I love the scene with the bubbles!  \\"A classic board book\\" is right--I think I need to get Good Dog, Carl for my son too.	2005-09-13

My baby is at a point in his development where he will put up with my reading to him, but he's not really interested in paper products beyond their value as objects (in other words, he likes the rustling sounds of catalogs and likes to tear them, but he generally doesn't care about the words and pictures on the pages).  The beauty of this board book is that it gives a baby something physical to do.  Although my son didn't show much interest on our first reading, I have a feeling that he will come to appreciate the opportunity to flip the sun/moon disc over.<br /><br />The book is short enough for limited attention spans, and it offers some interesting observations about night and day.	2005-09-13

When I was pregnant, my husband and I went to a baby-related event at a nearby hospital.  One attendee raised his hand and asked a presenter about some kind of contraption to put a baby in so that the baby could share his or her parents' bed.  \\"Oh, we don't recommend cosleeping,\\" the presenter interrupted, and she moved on to address another question.<br /><br />That was that, I thought.  I had no idea that anyone would even consider sharing a bed with an infant in our society.  I actually kind of looked down on the guy who'd asked the question.<br /><br />A few months later I went through about 18 hours of labor followed by a C-section with general anesthetic.  Afterward I took narcotics for the pain, and I could not have stayed awake while feeding my baby if my life had depended on it.  When I got home, I discovered that the most painless way to feed my son was to lie on my side--so I continued to fall asleep during feedings.<br /><br />Eventually, we were cosleeping nearly all the time, and I felt guilty about it.  One night my husband and I decided to make a go of getting our son into his crib, and it was around 2 AM that night when I bought this book.<br /><br />Although I'd hesitate to base my stance on a single book alone, Good Nights made me feel significantly better about our situation.  I think its ideal audience is made up of parents-to-be, but I was pleased with the information I found in its pages.  The authors discuss a wealth of literature the interested reader can check out; they also provide anecdotes from many current and former cosleepers.<br /><br />Topics covered by the book include ways kids begin cosleeping, ways they stop, how to deal with other people's perceptions, how (and where) sex can continue, how to be safe about cosleeping, why people should cosleep, and why crying it out can be harmful.  All this information is very reassuring for the cosleeping family.<br /><br />There were a few ideas/implications that didn't sit well with me.  For instance, I don't think a crib's only use in a cosleeping family is to give the cat a place to sleep.  Also, the only other sleeping option the authors really cover in depth is the cry-it-out method.  While the cry-it-out method had its day and, I'm sure, is recommended by plenty of books, not ONE person has suggested that we let our baby cry it out.  Several people have suggested that we put him in his crib, comfort him, put him in his crib, comfort him, and so on--this is the method that led me to buy the book in the wee hours of the morning, and I'd like to know what Dr. Jay has to say about it.<br /><br />Overall, the book was very refreshing.  It was a quick and pleasant read, and I want to get my husband and my mom to read it too.  I wish that I'd known more about cosleeping before I had my son--then I might not have felt so guilty about our situation.ib's only use in a cosleeping family is to give the cat a place to sleep.

I had Pat the Bunny as a kid, but I'd never seen such a cool cloth book; we've been showing it to visitors when they come over.  It's very entertaining to hop the bunny through the scenes, and I know we'll have lots of fun with the book in the future.  What a great way to get kids (and the adults they read with) involved in the story!<br /><br />The scenes are charming, and the concept combines storytime (and bedtime, since the sleepy bunny is getting ready for bed) with playtime.  I'm very excited that people are thinking outside the box as they create products for children.	2005-04-19

This book may have been the first gift my husband ever gave me, so I may be inclined to go easy on it.  It is true that the book is outdated and that some of the sites and trails it describes have changed considerably since publication.  We also found that the description of how to get to one of the ghost towns was inadequate--we happened on the remains of some buildings eventually, but that was sheer luck; we'd given up on finding the town and were headed back from our trip.<br /><br />However, the book told us a lot about locations of potential interest, and we've had a lot of fun checking out places we never would have known about otherwise.  It's nice to have older pictures to compare to what we see, and Brown offers great summaries of places we may want  to learn more about.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this book--just make sure you have supplemental information to avoid frustration while navigating.	2005-03-28

I don't know that I would have picked it out for myself, but it serves its purpose beautifully.  The cover & the box are smooth & attractive; the pages are heavy-duty; the illustrations are pretty; what little text there is is interesting & useful.<br />It's especially nice, I think, that there are slots for 3\\" X 5\\" or 4\\" X 6\\" pictures.  Unfortunately, these aren't standard professional picture sizes, but that was only a problem for us the first year or so; we don't have professional photos taken very often.<br />I think it'll be a lot of fun to look back through all the pictures and memories with our grandkids on our 50th anniversary.	2005-03-25

It always made me feel better about my jack-o-lantern deteriorating--my mom would suggest that it was time to put it out in the woods for Mousekin.  In fact, last year I carved a pumpkin specifically to look like a mouse's house.  I really want my son to be able to read the book when he gets big enough; I'd love for him to feel as good about the welfare of jack-o-lanterns as I always have!  I think it's a huge loss that so many classrooms and children's bookshelves are missing this book--it's really one of the best children's books I've ever read, and I consider Mousekin to be part of our family.	2005-03-15

There are a lot of useful and interesting topics in it, and the illustrations really help the cause.  I actually used some of the information to figure out how to make proper togas when the garments were called for in a junior high skit.  Other memorable subjects:  how to hold a crocodile, how to identify a member of the Diagram Group, how to make a mummy, how to recognize a mythological creature, how to pickle walnuts (I secretly planned to try this, but never got around to it), how to handle a hamster, how to photograph fish, how to play various games, how to become a saint, how to take a cat's temperature. . .<br /><br />Really, How to Hold a Crocodile is good for all ages.  I've looked at my copy so much that the spine isn't doing so well--and it wasn't a poorly-put-together spine to begin with.  I'd recommend this item as a birthday gift, graduation gift, etc. for pretty much  anyone who can read English or will be able to in the future.	2005-01-28

As a proofreader, I have found this book to be as helpful as the AP Stylebook or Chicago Manual of Style.  While the CMS rigidly covers rules and the AP Stylebook mainly helps me with individual words or references to organizations, Woe Is I has helped me out of specific sticky situations.  For instance, one of my high school English teachers taught that \\"if I\\" always went with \\"were\\" instead of \\"was,\\" but I came upon a situation in a book where \\"if I were\\" just didn't seem right.  Patricia O'Conner, with examples and extremely accessible language, helped me get my mind around the problem so that I could do my job well.<br /><br />Woe Is I is extremely readable.  Unlike the other reference books I mentioned in this review, this book could be read straight through--and the reader would probably retain a fair amount of the information covered in the text.  The helpful, humorous writing makes the book a valuable tool; I was skeptical when I received it as a gift, but have found it to be worth its weight in gold.	2005-01-28

A distant cousin gave me her copy of this book--it had been given to her by my great-grandma, and she'd read it time and time again.  She warned me, though, that there were outdated notions in the book and that it wouldn't be acceptable by today's standards.<br /><br />There is some truth to what she said; the book's age is apparent in many ways.  The sort of small, gossipy, isolated town Molly lives in still exists today, but is not so common as it was in Molly's time.  One can hope that a modern doctor wouldn't support, let alone suggest, some of the weight-loss measures Molly takes.  And, of course, standards for widows--and for women in general--have changed.<br /><br />But Molly's personality is more timeless than the societal issues.  Her frivolity, her fickle flirtation, and the realizations she makes as she becomes less childish all contribute to her likability and the writing's believability.  Furthermore, the buildup to the climax is excellent.  This book may never be considered a classic, but it is thoroughly enjoyable--a perfect read for a rainy afternoon.	2005-01-25

It's great, in this day and age, to see a book that has been proofread so well that I actually don't give any thought to the editing.  That alone makes this book a breath of fresh air, but there's also an ease and purity in the storytelling.  I hadn't had a book this size go by so quickly in quite some time.<br /><br />David Sedaris, I feel, is a great guy who hasn't yet found the wonderful life he ought to have.  As such, he's easy to identify with--who hasn't thought, \\"If they only understood me and gave me a chance, I'd be able to get all the fabulous things I deserve\\"?<br /><br />Some of the language and imagery I saw while flipping through Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim for the first time troubled me, but I'm glad I read the book anyway.  There may be unpleasant concepts in it, but the writing and the author's outlook are so pleasant that they more than override the discomfort a reader feels when experiencing those concepts.	2005-01-25

This book contains quite a bit of information about the politics of India at a very tumultuous time; the information is presented in a way to make it extremely accessible to young women, which is an impressive feat.  It seems to me like a lot of the Pleasant Company's main characters are somewhat rebellious, which makes them more attractive to a modern audience but also probably makes them less realistic.  However, supporting characters, like Neela's sister in this book, let us view what more traditional young women would be doing as the action (in this case, Neela risking everything familiar to save her family and help her country) took place.	2005-01-06

The illustrations are absolutely beautiful--rich and vibrant, in the perfect shades--and the story is simple and complex at the same time.  There are so many lessons here, like:  you should word requests carefully so that you get exactly what you want; sometimes even when you get what you want it isn't quite what you expected; if you love someone, you should worry about his/her needs and desires as well as your own; taking care of someone else is a big responsibility.  The whimsical details of a penguin's life with a boy all lend themselves to teaching these lessons.  This is probably a great book for a kid who asks Santa for a pet every year, and it's also really entertaining for adults.  The author could have made the story excessively sappy, but instead she gave it just the right amount of emotion--it's beautiful.	2004-11-04

The writing in this book is much stronger and more vivid than the writing in Stranger in the Woods.  Stranger in the Woods gave me the feeling that the photos could stand on their own at least as well as they could with the text.  Lost in the Woods, however, has a definite storyline to help the images along.  I don't appreciate the fairly meaningless repetition of sounds (like \\"chickadee-dee-dee\\") any more than I did in the first book, but it doesn't stick out as badly here.  I felt a little thrown when I got to a point in the storyline that seemed to be the climax/ending and found that the book didn't end there, but the story is good overall.  The photos are charming, and the back of the book features a selection of critter pictures to go back and find within the larger photos.  There's a lot to look at here.	2004-11-04

This book is probably extremely helpful for people in a few categories.  It would be quite helpful to someone who wants to train a cat for show business or for cat shows; it would also be extremely helpful to someone who has never been around cats, someone who has been around cats but doesn't really understand them, someone who wants to learn basics about different cat breeds, or someone who is going to be living with a cat for the first time.<br />I had lived with cats before by the time I read this book, and I found most of the provided information to be fairly obvious.  Feline body language, for instance, is one topic covered by the text.  There were some bits that were interesting and/or surprising to me, though.  For example, there is a short section on chattering.  My present cat does sometimes chatter, but previous cats I'd known never did, so this topic was new for me.<br />The portion of the book about cat selection was not all that insightful, to my mind.  If I did want to adopt a purebred cat, I'd want to research breeds in more depth than the book offered; but my cat came from a shelter, and I felt like the only advice the author had that applied to \\"impure\\" breeds was to make sure that the individual cat to be adopted was healthy and well-adjusted.<br />If you're looking for basics on cats, breed selection, cat training, and/or cat mannerisms, this book is an excellent choice for you.  If you're already familiar with cat behavior and have no interest in extensive training, however, the book won't tell you much that you need to know.	2004-08-26

Maybe my expectations were too high--I read the reviews and thought the book was going to be fantastic, especially since I love corvidae (the crow/raven family) so much.  The story strikes me as being oddly undeveloped, though--like it's an early draft and the editor has not made suggestions yet.<br />For a book about ravens, Raven's End is surprisingly humancentric.  The author wants us to stop and think about humanity so badly that he falls into heavy-handedness.  I find it hard to believe that ravens would give as much thought to humans as these ravens clearly do--they ponder the causes of roadkill, garbage disposal, differences in the treatment of birds in and out of protected areas, and other results of human life.  The ravens themselves show an unlikely number of similarities to humans--they have mayors (Main Ravens), drugs (Magic Meat), murder/cannibalism, bullying, religion/a sort of cult, and any number of other human afflictions.  I will admit that the cannibalism and bullying could occur in raven societies, but the other societal problems strike me as being purely human.<br />Even the non-human aspects of the ravens frequently seem far-fetched.  Why would all ravens use their genus/species name/initials for a last name?  Humans don't call themselves \\"Steve H. S.\\" or \\"Jenny Homo sapiens.\\"  For that matter, would ravens give themselves species names?<br />My last problem with the book is that it starts off so slowly.  I was riveted by the end--possibly because it took so long for me to work through the first part of the book that I just had to see that it really did reach a conclusion.<br />All that said, there are some good aspects of Raven's End.  Character development occurs; there is a plot; we do see many aspects of life away from humans.  In some ways, the book reminds me of Felix Salten's Bambi.<br />The author clearly knows and cares about the geographical area where the story occurs.  I could stand a little more description of the landscape--sometimes it seems like Ben Gadd thinks the location is a given.  There was one part where a location was kept from the reader, and it reminded me of how authors used to give the first letter only of a town they featured in a novel; I was a little amused by that, and it made me think that the author had a specific location in mind but wanted to protect it from all of us.  I admire his loyalty to the land.<br />I really liked what Gadd did with the lynx storyline in the book--that was one of the highlights.  A lot of the minor characters were neither ravens nor humans, and they were interesting and entertaining.<br />Not many authors these days publish novels of this type, and it's refreshing to see something written from a different point of view once in a while.

I'm not sure whether or not I will read it again, though.	2004-04-23
US	52264114	RPIWO5OWAW9RH	0848803248	818419685	Dear Enemy	Books	4	3	4	N	N	An excellent sequel.	It's nice to see the characters we all so appreciated in Daddy Long-Legs in a different context; I loved getting to know the characters better.  It is true that some outdated concepts are presented in the book, but I think it's important to note that Jean Webster seems to question most of those concepts.  The characters ultimately seek love over &quot;suitability&quot; and what's right over what's appropriate.  Even the concept of eugenics is repeatedly questioned by the main character, who doesn't quite believe the hype but is willing to let a man of science &quot;educate&quot; her.  Yes, the book is dated (as was its predecessor, to some extent), but the story and characters it contains are timeless.	2004-04-14

She went through the whole thing with us, and we tittered at objects such as the \\"ceremonial chestpiece.\\"  One of my college archaeology professors displayed some images from the book as overheads, as well, and I thought he made a poignant point:  that archaeologists sometimes make things up when they don't know the answers.  Mysterious objects suddenly take on supposed religious significance.<br />The author made his point clearly and humorously.  Archaeologists and laypeople alike should take a look at this book.	2002-04-25

My first thought when I saw it on the shelf was, \\"Oh, a new Daniel Pinkwater novel!  I better get that.\\"  About halfway through the first story, though, I began to be suspicious.  \\"This isn't a novel. . .or is it?  Is he kidding, or is he serious?  Is this nonfiction?\\"  This is one of the great things about Daniel Pinkwater--he keeps you on your toes, always trying to guess what is next to come.  By the time I'd finished the book, I'd learned some neat dog-training tips (in case I should ever need them).  I'd laughed guiltily and hysterically at the idea of a parrot being frightened to death by the misconception that it was being cooked, and I'd thought a lot about how funny life can be.  This book is good for reading over one long sitting or for digesting one anecdote at a time.	2002-04-19

There were times I thought the story of Maison Ikkoku would never end--the complications just compiled and continued!  But at last, the conclusion arrived, and it left me feeling relieved and satisfied.  I was still left to wonder about a couple things, though.  For instance, just what does Yotsuya do for a living?  Was this something I was supposed to pick up at some point, or are we left to wonder forevermore?<br />I'm glad I started reading the series, and I'm glad I read it all the way through.  All that money was well worth it.	2002-04-19

I didn't feel as connected to Sally Lockhart as I did to Lyra of Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy.  However, the Sally Lockhart trilogy is still worth a read--it is educational (in that Pullman seems to know his London history and to really feel the pain of women who were not treated as full people) and suspenseful (in that Sally always stumbles into some sort of dangerous mystery which must be solved).  I'd definitely recommend any of the Philip Pullman books I've read to anyone.	2002-03-18

The storyline of this book is fairly predictable:  the little raven is shunned by the other animals when he is greedy and takes their playthings, but he is forgiven as soon as he apologizes and gives the toys back.  The illustrations, however, are fun to look at and make the story more interesting.  There are plenty of little details to discover on each page, and the characters and their toys are pleasant to look at.  The book ends up being an enjoyable read.	2002-03-18
US	52264114	R3DWPC6OQE2BNB	0811829634	582862079	Ernie: A Photographer's Memoir	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Hilarious!	As my husband and I flipped through this book, he kept asking, &quot;Do we need to get this?&quot; and I kept saying, &quot;No.&quot; But then we got to one of the funniest pictures I've ever seen, and I was laughing too hard to say no again. We bought the book, and everyone I've shown it to thinks it's very clever.<br />I'm generally opposed to putting words in nonhuman animals' mouths, but at least Mendoza isn't cutesy about what Ernie might have to say. The book is really entertaining.	2002-03-10

Rumiko Takahashi's stuff is not for the impatient, however.  If you want instant gratification, you'll have to look elsewhere.  But hey, good things are worth the wait, or so they say.	2001-02-22

I love the way Janell Cannon takes an animal which may be frightening to children--a snake, bat, cockroach, crow, or mystery animal--and makes it friendly.  The big issue I had upon buying this book was whether to sort Cannon's works alphabetically or chronologically, since till now it's been the same order either way.	2000-12-20

I plan to give a copy to my parents' neighbor, who recently cut down acres of beautiful trees for no good reason.	2000-12-09

I have read a Harry Potter book now, and I still hold that The Golden Compass is much, much better.  There are SO many levels to it, so it's fantastic for young and old.  This series explores the fundamental issues of life and existence in an open-minded way, and Pullman does a fantastic job of pulling this trick off.  I hope one day to even be half as good a writer as he is.	2000-12-09

Since I had to read this book for a class, I wasn't altogether excited about beginning it.  Still, it grabbed my attention from the first page--Butler definitely has the ability to get a reader interested!  As the book progressed, however, I got increasingly annoyed with the characters--ALL the characters.  I was frustrated that none of them seemed capable of positive development and just wanted to yell at them.  The reading was enjoyable to begin with, but unsatisfying in the end.	2000-12-09

Now I'm 19, and I still make her read it to me. Everybody should read this book!	1999-06-02
