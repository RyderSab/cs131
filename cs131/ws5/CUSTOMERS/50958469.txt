Calling for a return to philology and criticizing the jargon-laden obscuratinism and relativism of much of contemporary humanistic practice, Said nevertheless maintains the benefit of close readings of texts and a multiculturalism that consists of expanding the canon rather than tossing it out all together -- in contrast to the willful ignorance of other cultures advocated by the likes of Harold Bloom and Bernard Lewis. <br /> <br />Said also updates and expands on his views of the intellectual in public life which he touched upon in the series of lectures \\"Representations of the Intellectual.\\"  I found these parts quite interesting.  However, if you don't hold the same views as the Old Left, you will need to substitute your own discontents for some of his particulars.	2005-07-03

The arc of the play isn't very broad, but the dissolution of the main character, Howard Katz, is compelling and disturbing.  Although Marber does descend into philosophical/spiritual soliloquies, something I am not terribly fond of in drama, and Katz's redemption is unconvincing, the play as a whole is quite engaging.  At a minimum, this play is a stark lesson on not being an a--hole.	2005-05-27

The second part of the text deals with individual plays: linking \\"Ghosts\\" with Greek drama, discussing \\"Rosmersholm\\" as dialectic between southern European \\"civilization\\" and a northern European passion and freedom, and showing the Mithraic/Zoroastrian underpinning of \\"The Master Builder.\\"  This last chapter had a nice bonus for me as I had not known the extent to which Persian mythology underlay Germanic and Nordic mythology, and in particular had always wondered why there are so many parallels between Viking romances and stories in the Shahnameh.  <br /> <br />Overall I quite enjoyed Johnston's analysis.  Despite repeating \\"Ibsen is great\\" a few too many times, I found his criticism to be much more insightful, relevant, and open-minded than what I would have gotten from a more contemporary, obscure, jargon-laden analysis like those found in Marxist/Freudian/queer/feminist/postmodernist readings of texts.  <br />	2005-05-26

The beautifully simple implication of the hoax, and the clarity with which the scientists present their case, is countered by personal insults, obscuratinist jargon, and backtracking on the part of the postmodernists in an attempt to mask their intellectual bankruptcy.   <br /> <br />One thing that surprised me was how much better the scientists write than the pomos.  Given that clear writing requires clear thinking, this should have been expected. The best example of pomo fuzzy-headedness is the argument that because people in power have said that some things are true that aren't, it is oppressive to claim that anything, including physical laws, are true. <br /> <br />Sokal executed his hoax to reclaim reason and logic as tools of the Left, and this internal debate eats up a chunk of the book and includes implicit arguments such as the claim that the humanities is and must remain the exclusive domain of the Left.  Not being a lefty, I feel that the more important implication of the hoax is with the broader academic enterprise and a wider Age of Unreason that goes beyond politics (not just pomos, but new agers, religious conservatives, anti-science corporatists, etc.), and an interest in these issues is the major reason to read this excellent anthology.	2005-04-27

However, there is quite a bit in the last third of the book for readers who are moving from film to digital or learning how to use digital editing software.  For this more advanced audience, there is even some useful advice on picking a digital camera in the first sections. <br /> <br />Although the core concepts covered in the book should carry forward for sometime, much of the book is becoming outdated (for example there is no discussion of the new Adobe digital negative format as an alternative to compressed TIFF for archiving images, and camera specs are also behind the times).  An updated version would be welcome for the intended audiences, and I would most likely rate that book 4 to 5 stars. <br /> <br />Because this book is a broad introductory text, and does not go in-depth into any topic, use of the word \\"Mastering\\" in the title, not to mention trademarking this one word, is inappropriate.	2005-03-24

It's to be expected that in a popular book like this that examples would be simplified and stretched to fit an argument, but I found them to be quite reasonable at the core.  Moreover, the thesis itself is quite nuanced and far from a pean to the God of the Market.   <br /> <br />The first part of the book covered the basic ideas of collective wisdom, particularly the different kinds of problems collective decision making units are able to solve, and the conditions needed for them to be successful.  The second part of the book was a collection of case studies: automobile traffic, scientific research, small groups, corporations and the CEO, capital markets, and democracies.  The case studies provided insight into what makes collective wisdom so effective, what limits individual  and small groups from being as effective (particularly in trying to govern or command an economy), and also what can lead to collective idiocy. <br /> <br />The biggest thing I took away from this book was a renewed faith in democracy, the power of markets, and the scientific enterprise.  I also came to understand better why extreme socialist or laissez-faire policies inevitably lead to failure.	2005-02-12
US	50958469	ROXBL8CVS7OXT	0674006135	160288803	The Structure of Evolutionary Theory	Books	2	56	86	N	Y	Needs a sympathetic rewrite or at least an editor	I do not recommend you read this book unless you are an academic in the field and need to do so.  Although I am unsympathetic with many of the ideas in it, the primary reason for my low rating is that the book was overlong and poorly written where it matters.<br /><br />I'll start with what I liked about the book.  The first chapters were on the history of evolutionary theory, and it is here where Gould's principal strength as a popularizer comes through well.  Although these chapters could have been more concise, and they were oriented towards backing Gould's ideas, I enjoyed them for the most part.  The last chapters in the modern theory section on the importance of constraint were interesting, though they suffered heavily from Gould's style of discourse.  I found the last pages of the book on the importance of contingency to be quite beautiful.<br /><br />The bulk of the book consisted of the material on punctuated equilibrium and Gould's hierarchy of Darwinian individuals.  I had issues with the ideas themselves, but these are a distant second to what I felt about Gould's notion of an argument.  Evolutionary biology is not a branch of philosophy and textual analysis should not, as Gould claims, \\"be pursued more often in scientific discussion.\\"  They are not done so, according to him, because of the \\"philistinistic culture of science.\\"  Molecular biology and mathematics are vital components of evolutionary biology, as much and perhaps more so than the incomplete fossil record.  Gould gave lip service to molecular biology and much less respect to the now venerable and important discipline of population genetics - except of course when the results from these fields backed up his narrative.<br /><br />Gould's use of lawyerly argument, where verdict is truth, is the reason why he is rightfully disdained for opening the door to creation \\"science\\" in the debate on teaching evolution in schools.  By stripping away hard science, and replacing it with metaphors, cartoons, and narratives, Gould took a rigorous theory, based firmly on empirical and deductive facts, and replaced it with a secular creation myth that is open to attack.  Although this has made him the darling of what he calls the \\"literati\\", it is also what made him a bad scientist.  The fact that he addressed modern Darwinism tangentially, chose instead to focus on Darwin's and others Victorian era writings, and rejected ideas because they didn't \\"feel right,\\" didn't improve his standing with me.<br /><br />Gould's writing when it came to the science under debate was a nightmare.  Intentionally or not, he constructed a complex hierarchy of nested, irrelevant tangents; tangents that were fragments within sentences, which were then tangents within paragraphs, which were in turn tangents within sections, ad nauseam.  One of the most frustrating aspects of the book was that he refused to give a clear definition of what he meant by \\"punctuated equilibrium\\" until pg 1001: \\"We locate any revisionary status for punctuated equilibrium in its suggestions about the nature of stasis, and particularly its implications for attributing macroevolutionary phenomena to causes operating on the differential success of species treated as Darwinian individuals.  Ordinary speciation remains fully adequate to explain the causes and phenomenology of punctuation.\\"  Others, such as Richard Dawkins, have done much on addressing this definition of punctuated equilibrium.  My comment here is that it took so long to come to it, and up until this point Gould hinted at saltationist underpinnings to punctuated equilibrium, only to later decry and impugn the integrity of his critics for criticizing these alternative definitions.<br /><br />My main intellectual criticism was of Gould's hierarchy of Darwinian individuals.  I thought this was fine as a phenomenological tool to describe macroevolutionary events, but Gould inverted cause and phenomena to claim that species selection is irreducible to gene or organism selection.  His reason why?  \\"Nonlinearities.\\"  Along with not knowing what the word \\"fractal\\" means, which he used quite a bit to mean either \\"self-similar\\" or \\"scales up\\", Gould thought \\"nonlinear\\" meant \\"hopelessly complex.\\"  His style of argument?  Keep repeating the word irreducible until the reader breaks down.  Gould was snidely dismissive towards the results of population genetics, but only addressed them directly in a (relatively) brief two page discussion where he claimed that they had to be invalid because population genetics models were able to explain both punctuated equilibrium (stasis followed by rapid change) and his cartoon notion of Victorian gradualism.  Since Gould himself was clear that both are evident in the fossil record, it is strength, not a weakness, of a modeling system to be able to explain both.<br /><br />Although the ideas in the book did not all resonate with me, I would have recommended it if it was more clear and much, much more concise, since the ideas in it are an important part of the current discussion on evolutionary theory.  But because of the poor writing in the important scientific parts of the book, and Gould's often unprofessional comments towards critics, I don't think this behemoth of a tome is worth your time.ucible to gene or organism selection.

The first essay on Brassa covers a long swath of his life, but the parts I found most interesting where those about his relationships with other artists in Paris during the late 1920's and 30's, particularly Henry Miller, and his intellectual influences, such as Goethe and Nietzsche.  The best word I can find to describe the narrative and writing in this essay is \\"pleasant.\\"  I particularly enjoyed Travis' description of Brassa's work as capturing \\"flow and duration\\", and contrasting it with Cartier-Bresson's \\"decisive moment.\\"   I found this description of Brassa's work to be among the best aspects of the book.     The second essay deals with Kertsz.  Although Travis discusses much of Kertsz's work during the 1920's, he mainly focuses on the picture \\"Chez Mondrian,\\" Kertsz's relationship with Mondrian, and even much on Mondrian himself.  While I did enjoy this essay, I didn't take as much away from it as the others.    The third essay was by far my favorite, not just because it is about the relationship between mathematics and photography and I am a mathematician, but because it is genuinely deep and novel.  Travis discusses the creative process in photography through metaphors with mathematical reasoning and proof in the (relatively) accessible field of number theory, even going so far as to proclaim that \\"there is no difference in the way a creative idea comes to a mathematician and the way one comes to a photographer.\\"  Although most of the metaphors are just that, and effectively so, the comparison between Euclid's proof of the Pythagorean Theorem and Cartier-Bresson's \\"Hyres, France\\" approaches a true bijection.  This example was my absolute favorite part of the book.  Travis goes further and explains the role of beauty and aestheticsin mathematical creativity, drawing upon Hadamard's \\"The Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field.\\"  Here Travis also gets into the role of the subconscious in both mathematical and artistic creativity.    A respected curator of photography, especially at a place like the Art Institute of Chicago, going off and studying mathematics, and then coming back and teaching so much about photography, has to be one of the most remarkable intellectual exercises I have every encountered.      The fourth essay deals with how the presence or absence of narratives in photography affects our experience of the artwork.    This leads to the primary discussion of the last three essays on artists in old age.  Travis tries to show the importance of the later work of Weston, Stieglitz, and Strand, and the tenor of his arguments are summed up in one he makes about Strand:     \\"What then is there to say about a photograph of an autumn leaf, especially one in black and white?  Beyond some diagram of composition, the answer to this question depends on the photographer who made it.  Of Paul Strand, there is a lot to say.  Of a leaf centered in his 1973 'Fall in Movement', there is less.\\"    Travis does note that Strand himself felt photographs should stand more or less alone.  I can't give an opinion on this issue, but, like all the other essays in this collection, the last four are a joy to read.    As noted by a previous reviewer, the photographic printing in this book leaves much to be desired.  While mostly a distraction, the poor print quality strongly interferes with what Travis has to say about Weston's \\"Point Lobos.\\"    All in all, this book is a must read if you have an interest in the art history of photography or art photography in general.	2004-10-18

Direct discussion of the literature itself is cursory, but is fleshed out by relating it to the conditions of life in the IRI (Nabokov to start, Gatsby for false dreams, James for war, and Austin for sexuality).   Through this, we learn something of the power of good fiction, the difficulties of life for a secular person under a theocracy, and (supposedly) something of Iran.   The first two are valuable.  However, Ms. Nafisi has little more to teach about Iran or Persian culture than what you get off Fox News. <br /> <br />It is a fact that the IRI is a terrible regime.  None the less, it is not a cardboard cut-out of a Bela Lugosi character.  Ms. Nafisi only indirectly touches upon the internal conflicts between Islam and a Persian culture that exists independent of it.  By only occasionally citing the suppression of Persian literature, she makes the primary, internal conflict, seem secondary to the more familiar one between Islam and the West.  Alone, this is an excusable omission, but Ms. Nafisi goes on to paint a picture of modern Iran as completely devoid of culture, with a cursory dismissal of even their (Western) award winning cinema.  One of the only films she mentions by name is \\"Not Without My Daughter.\\"  <br /> <br />As for history, Ms. Nafisi makes no mention of the constitutional revolution or Mossadegh's government in the early 50's, but does manage somehow to claim that \\"in the 1960's, there was little difference between my rights and the rights of women in Western democracies.\\"  While not even true with respect to the rights of men vs. women in the Shah's Iran, she seems to have never learned that life in a democracy includes the right to vote in a fair and meaningful election.  Also, I don't think King Olav V would have (or even could have) tossed her father in jail if he were the mayor of Oslo rather than Tehran. <br/> <br />Ms. Nafisi's Orientalist bent becomes overt in the last section where she redevelops the canard that all Muslim men are sexually repressed perverts and that Iranians lack the sophisticated Western capacity for romantic love.  This is a revision of the Victorian belief that Muslims are over-sexed perverts incapable of love; a change needed to keep the story effective given the evolution of Western gender roles.  Whether Ms. Nafisi truly feels this or needed to write it to secure the patronage of Bernard Lewis and Fouad Ajami, I don't know.	2004-10-03

In the first sixty or so pages, Pesic does a great job of  covering the history of what people understood to be a solution of an algebraic equation, and hence the evolution of the notion of number.  Starting with how the Greeks moved from understanding whole numbers and rational numbers to discovering the irrational roots, he moves gracefully to the understanding of imaginary, and then complex numbers in the 1600's.   <br /> <br />The flow of the book is rougher for the next 25 pages or so, as the mathematics becomes less elegant, really quite a zoo.  Attempts here to give a verbal explanation of the mathematics confuse more than they enlighten.  The last half of the book is the meat of the work and is also the best done.  Beginning with Abel's tragic personal story and interweaving the lives and work of other mathematicians of the time, in particular the other famous tragedy of Galois, Pesic then moves on to a very lucid description of elementary group theory.  Also touched upon are transcendental numbers and matrices.  The last chapters on what it all means for science and human understanding summed up the message of the book quite nicely.     <br /> <br />I recommend the book for anyone looking to understand a bit more about pure mathematics.  It is short, easy to read, and extremely well written and reasoned in the main. <br /> <br />One gripe: Pesic refers to two Persian mathematicians, Omar Khayyam and al-Khwarizimi, as Arabs.  Both are from historic Khorasan province which is now in either northeastern Iran or in Uzbekistan and spoke Farsi or a Farsi variant, not Arabic, as their native language ([...] [...]  Persians are not Arabs, and al-Khwarizimi writing his math in Arabic doesn't make him so.

However, he does follow his own advice in going from the general to the specific when he discusses particular forms of science writing, the use of graphics, and oral presentations. Montgomery has useful things to say at every turn, but I found the core strength of the book to be how he solidly and clearly gets across the idea that &quot;true elegance in science resides in simplicity and restraint.&quot; Much of the higher level discussion deals with writing well (proficient functional communication) versus writing very well (creatively, within the constraint of restraint). Montgomery stresses the importance of reading well to writing well, and gives suggestions on how to become a better critical reader. Be forewarned: this guide does not deal with grammar, syntax or style. <br />  <br /> I read this book because I am an applied mathematician who needs to communicate results to biologists. While writing mathematics is not explicitly covered in this book, and there are major difference between scientific writing and mathematics writing, I do believe the major tenets of this guide will be useful to applied mathematicians of most any stripe.	2004-08-03

The main topics are how wolves became selected as dogs, what this implies for their behavior and training, and the ethics of pure-breeding and using working dogs as pets.  In these core topics, this book is generally well argued and supported in the main, but suffers from hiccups of poor reasoning.  In one example, when arguing why bigger dogs are better for the transhumance, the authors state &quot;to cover the distance with half the steps means a longer lasting dog.&quot;  Well, the bigger dog also takes heavier steps and big dogs are notorious for structural problems.  However, these hiccups are minor distractions.<br />The first core topic that dogs evolved first as scavengers of human waste dumps is interesting.  While still largely a speculative hypothesis, this idea is shown fairly well in the book to be more reasonable than the idea that humans got a hold of enough wolves to domesticate them by selecting the tamest ones and tossing the others.  This has implications for training in that essentially sedentary dogs foraging at a dump are not going to have wolf behaviors, particularly the widely assumed pack hierarchy.<br />Another major topic is the discussion on why working dogs, with strongly ingrained motor patterns of behavior, are not going to be well suited for living in a house - unless you like being herded by your border collie.  This too is well done and promoting the option of a more &quot;generic&quot; dog as a better household companion will do much good.  There is also a section on how assistance dogs suffer by being bred and developed in manners inconstant with what makes for a good working dog.  While this has been criticized as an argument against assistance dogs, a careful reading will show that it is a valid critique of how the system can be improved.<br />The Coppingers' critique of the profound wrong that is breeding for show will upset the most people.  But it is alsothe best and most important argument in the book.  And no, breeding for work, for behavior, which doesn't involve closing a stud book, is not just as bad or the same thing as breeding for appearance from a closed stud book.<br />Throughout the book, the Coppingers also try to discuss what canine evolution implies for Darwinian theories of evolution, but do so in a confused manner by misunderstanding gradualism in the modern sense as being slow, constant changes in morphology (they also use the word &quot;saltation&quot; in a broad and confused way) rather than the actual meaning of continuous, though possibly quite fast, change at the genetic level.  They themselves argue that canids have not changed much genetically and that their diversity of form is due to developmental reasons with the needed genetic variation provided by hybridization within the species. Fortunately, these discussions are not central to enjoying the book.<br />The Coppingers write with a bit of wit, which I enjoyed.  But most importantly, this book is unique to my knowledge in trying to be rational, rather than sentimentally anthropomorphic, towards dogs.  As such should be read by anyone with an interest in them and their true well-being.	2004-07-16

The benefits of professionalism are transparent; more entertaining televised games, higher atheletic standards, etc.  But the weakening of the local club in the major rugby playing nations is the focus of the book.  The value seen in rugby for  building character, and of the clubs in building lasting community, carries over to American rugby quite strongly.  Why the game attracts such different, remarkable individuals is summed up well in the passage, <br />    &quot;At the amateur level, rugby sets the players at odds<BR>    with society.  Doing anything not for money is odd, <BR>    but we're doing something seriously and not for money,<BR>    with the risk of getting hurt, and not for money.&quot;<br />Beard does touch upon both the good and bad of the amateur game, discussing not just the constant innovation or the outlet it provides young adults, but also topics such as the excess drinking.  Overall, &quot;Muddied Oafs&quot; is a nice, well-told story of rugby and why it is such a big deal to so many people.	2004-05-07

The thrust is the introduction of aspects of philosophy through an analysis of the characters and stories in &quot;The Simpsons.&quot;  In this regard the book is mostly interesting and informative.  A big chunk of it (Part II and much of Part IV) wasn't philosophy at all, but rather &quot;literary&quot; criticism that I didn't much care for -- the worst essay in the collection being the Marxist hissy-fit.  Moreover, despite disclaimers throughout the text, there was an assumption of intent on the part of the script writers that, by listening to the voice-overs on the DVDs, one finds isn't really there.<br />For all the above, I would have rated this book 3 stars.  However, the essay &quot;The Function of Fiction&quot; was outstanding and worth the price of the book alone.  This essay spent a lot of time away from the Simpsons in particular, but ultimately gave the best argument why the show is so great.  <br />For readers looking for a light read about their favorite show, this book isn't the place to go.  But for people who love the Simpsons on all its levels, this book has its place.	2004-05-05

The text begins with a discussion of some philosophy and psychology of art that leads into the development of a conceptual model of the aesthetic experience built around the four dimensions of perception, emotion, intellectual engagement, and communication.   The bulk of the work consists of the quantitative analysis and interpretation of interviews with museum professionals.  The authors further discuss the model in the context of the data, and make recommendations on how museums can better serve their mission.<br />Although the book seems aimed at museums (the study was done at the behest of the Getty and published by the Getty Press), I found the &quot;flow&quot; model of the aesthetic experience to be quite enlightening, and useful in increasing the quality of my own aesthetic encounters.	2004-04-19

Sandweiss begins by discussing the limited uses of daguerrotypes as intermediaries for other forms of visual information in the context of the Mexican-American war and the unfolding western landscape.  She goes on to show that as the technology of wet-plate photography developed, so did the direct use of supposedly objective photographs in building the mythology of the western United States.  The chapter on photography and representations of American Indians was particularly strong and nuanced.<br />&quot;Print the Legend&quot; is recommended for anyone with an interest in early photography or western American history.

I also found useful the list a range of funding sources.<br />The only major drawback to the book as a general reference is that it is heavily oriented towards experimental biology.  Much of the nuts-and-bolts advice doesn't apply to theoretical work, and little or no equivalent advice is given for theoretical proposals.	2004-04-13

Dawkins discusses the probabilities and time scales involved, and makes an important distinction between single-step selection and cumulative selection.  He builds on this distinction to discuss how the theory of punctuated equilibria fits into Neo-Darwinism -- rather than lying outside of it like the often confused theory of saltationism.  Included in the discussion are explanations why other origin theories, Lamarckism, creationism, etc., are necessarily incorrect.<br />Aspects of the book I found to be quite strong were the popular explanations of mathematical genetics, particularly Russ Lande's work on sexual selection, and the construction of \\"animal space\\" to get across the notion of gradual, step-by-step change.	2004-03-15

The underlying premise of the book is that &quot;becoming educated has more to do with thinking and talking about subjects or texts in analytical ways than with the subjects or texts you study.&quot;  While this premise breaks down rapidly as students progress in their major course of study, it is a useful assumption for teaching beginning college students.<br />Graff's focus is on how English departments should go about their business, and in doing so recommends making connections with popular culture -- since he assumes the subject of study is secondary to learning how to argue.  Graff goes on to criticize how different disciplines send different messages about what kind of composition is expected, mentioning not just the humanities and social sciences, but also the sciences and mathematics.  While using popular culture as a means of imparting analytical thinking skills is clearly inappropriate for these subjects, Graff does discuss an alternative means that I found interesting: a particular way of intertwining of natural language explanations along with the technical discourse.  His use of templates for writing essays also has analogs in the analysis that goes on in other disciplines.<br />Other topics touched upon in the book include the value of analytical thinking and a discussion of progressive versus traditional models of education.  <br />Overall, &quot;Clueless in Academe&quot; is useful reading for any teacher trying to get their students to think.	2004-02-23

The first aspect of the book, and the one that I found extremely useful, was the information on the glycemic index of different foods.  The glycemic index is a deeper understanding of carbohydrate quality over the prior notions of &quot;simple&quot; versus &quot;complex&quot; carbs.  The comparison of GI values for different foods is completely listed in tables in the back of the book, but comes through a lot better in the discussions of diets and dietary changes.  <br />It the recommended dietary changes -- and development of a GI-based diet -- that form the bulk of the book.  The authors emphasize that the GI can be used in a wide range of diets to replace &quot;bad&quot; carbs with &quot;good&quot; ones, an approach that is quite reasonable and flexible.  But the diet they emphasize the most is lower in protein than many others, including the Zone diet, which can be viewed as a high protein version of this diet.  Individuals will need to figure out on their own protein needs (I lift weights and maintain a fair amount of muscle mass, so my protein intake is much higher than the authors recommend.)<br />The authors minimize the impact of sugar on diabetes, obesity and heart disease, since sugar is only a moderate-GI food.  One aspect of the book that is somewhat unclear, though, is the role high-fructose corn syrup, used extensively in sodas in the United States and most other sweetened foods.  The authors cite high-fructose corn syrup as a high-GI food, but don't do so for the things that contain it.  Moreover, as the authors mention, fructose, and high-fructose corn syrup in particular, is processed directly in the liver, where it happens that triglycerides form.  The direct role of high-fructose corn syrup in raising triglycerides is well-understood, so this seems to be an area of the GI that needs further research.<br />The authors also discuss how fats, like carbs, differ in quality.  They cover which fats to avoid and which to add to ones diet, but it was not in the scope of this book to quantify fat quality as they did crab quality. <br />The GI approach to eating (and providing energy for exercise) is a well reasoned, flexible, balanced approach to nutrition and health.  This book is highly recommended, particularly to those individuals that Atkins-like diets have left depleted of muscle mass and the energy to exercise or do anything cognitively taxing.	2004-01-20

While it is somewhat more technical than what the casual reader may want, my goal was to learn something about &quot;real philosophy, not simplified philosophy.&quot;  The book hit the mark on this account.<br />I was drawn to the text because of another (popular) book by A. C. Grayling.  Each chapter of the text, however, is written by a different author.  Consequently, the chapters vary in style and, to some extent, quality.  I particularly enjoyed the chapters on methodology, the rationalists, the empiricists (by A. C. Grayling), and aesthetics.<br />It took some effort for this casual reader to get through the text, but it was well worth it.	2004-01-01

The second and third chapters focused on reporting science and interacting with scientists from a journalist's perspective.  A lot of the suggestions also apply to what makes for a good science student.  The final four chapters dealt with writing and some of the suggestions do cross over from journalism to other forms of writing.  The first chapter was the most enjoyable; the discussions of what science is and how scientists think were gems.  My favorites sections were on the mentoring process in science and the difference between scientific and legal forms of rational inquiry - truth vs. verdict.<br />I recommend this book mainly to people interested in becoming science writers.  I believe the suggestions would help anyone reporting on my own work, for example.  The suggestions and discussions in the book are also of value to scientists who wish to communicate their work.	2003-11-23

I was drawn to this title by the striking photograph on the cover and bought it immediately after flipping through it.  The strength of the example photographs makes &quot;Family Portraits&quot; case study approach particularly effective.<br />Unlike many other photography books, &quot;Family Portraits&quot; uses subjects with a wide range of skin tones.  Examples include both color and black &amp; white photographs, sometimes juxtaposed for comparison.  Since this book is part of a professional photography series, Daye assumes possession of some lighting equipment.  For many of the outdoor shots, fill flash and/or a reflector were the limits of what was required.  <br />The photographs in &quot;Family Portraits&quot; are posed pictures.  But because they are designed to seem natural, their study may help you notice certain compositions and lighting conditions when taking candids.  If you are looking for a good idea book for taking pictures of people, this title is an excellent place to start.	2003-09-22

He then discusses how we feel when doing these different types of activities.  The two core chapters cover work and leisure.  Csikszentmihalyi shows how engagement with ones job and pursuing active hobbies provide more personal satisfaction than passive entertainment and mere lounging.  It is this notion that will clash with many people's belief in what makes them happy; happiness being something that Csikszentmihalyi considers a fleeting emotion and different from true contentment.  As has been noted by the philosopher A.C. Grayling, if we are after happiness alone, then we can just self-medicate.<br />Other chapters examine how relationships are better if you engage in them, rather than merely meet material obligations to loved ones, and what kinds of personalities are better suited to achieving flow.  There is a chapter, as well as some discussion throughout, on how to increase flow in your own life.  This gives the book an additional self-help angle (which is what the back cover is trying to market it as.)  The final chapter begins with some light philosophizing and quickly degenerates into an off-topic discussion of religion, lacking a thesis and coming across as the ramblings of a stoned first-year college student.  This is unfortunate in that it mars an otherwise very strong treatment of what constitutes a good life.	2003-08-29

Although there is much that is accessible and relevant to a wider audience of academic professionals, Hall's heavy use of terminology from his own discipline (I still have no idea what a problematization is,) as well as his assumption that the reader is familiar with one particular school of self-help books, makes much of the book useless to someone who hasn't read and studied what he has.<br />The introduction is the worst part in this respect.  If I wasn't given this book by someone who expected me to read it, I would have stopped right there.  However, &quot;The Academic Self&quot; does oscillate between addressing Hall's fairly limited core audience and providing useful advice to a broader range of scholars, both at an abstract level and in terms of nuts-and-bolts, plan-out-your-day suggestions.	2003-08-28

But the best reason to read \\"Meditations for the Humanist\\" is that it is uplifting in its ethical and moral message - and by being so proves many of its points.	2003-07-03

It contains more advanced composition and technical advice than the first field guide, tailored to the specific art of photographing natural landscapes in a variety of settings and times of the day. Once again, Caputo writes a book that is not only succinct, but also enjoyable to read.<br />The Landscapes Field Guide maintains an important aspect of the original: profiles of National Geographic photographers, each with their own set of advice. This is a primary strength of the NGS photography field guides and something that separates them from other books.  Not only are the profile sections useful in learning how to go about taking pictures, they are interesting in their own right as glimpses into how different artists work.	2003-07-02

Satrapi does an excellent job of providing a historical timeline that highlights the key events leading up to the revolution and, in the opinion of this reviewer, accurately criticizes virtually all the major players for the wrongs they committed.<br />Persepolis is in some ways a fusion of Joe Sacco's \\"Palestine\\" and Sattareh Farman Farmaian's \\"Daughter of Persia.\\"  Satrapi's woodcut-style illustrations fit the simplified narrative.  The graphic novel format makes Persepolis an easy read - something you can pass off to a friend that won't take more than a couple of hours of their time.	2003-06-22

It is first and foremost the story of a chimp, Washoe, but also of the journey on which she takes Roger Fouts.  The story of Washoe and the other chimps in her extended family are the most engaging aspects of the book, but Fouts' career and personal development alongside them is interesting as well. <br />Intellectually, Fouts is at his strongest when he describes his language development research and the scientific debates that raged around it.  The ethical links between ape intelligence and ape rights were also well developed.  His stances on animal rights for other species were not as well motivated and in some sense undermine the justifications he put forth for an end to the use of great apes in research.<br />While at times oversentimental, Fouts does strike a chord emotionally as well as intellectually.  Our \\"next of kin\\" are lucky to have him on their side.	2003-04-09

Sapolsky is a very entertaining writer and the storytelling flows well from one topic to another.  In addition to the link between the ulcers of the title and stress, he goes over the links between stress and sex, immunity, memory, aging, heart disease and many other physiological processes.  I found the chapter on stress dwarfism to be the most interesting, even if I'll never be able to watch Peter Pan again.<br />Sapolsky does provide some common-sense advice on managing stress, but the principal value of \\"Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers\\" is not as a pop psychology book but as a work of popular science that goes a long way towards truly convincing people that chronic stress needs to be controlled.	2003-03-03

Despite the tremendous scope of time and space - over 1300 years and spanning from Spain to the East Indies -  Hourani furnishes the reader with a solid view of the many currents that underlie modern Islam.<br />I hope that this book will help provide a more nuanced understanding of the Islamic and Arab world - a world that is often viewed as monolithic by the West.

Consequently, she identifies highly functional people who are none the less pessimistic.  These individuals deal with their preexisting anxiety by using the strategy of &quot;defensive pessimism.&quot;  Norem discusses in detail the advantages and disadvantages of this strategy, but shows how those people predisposed to handling their anxiety via defensive pessimism can be harmed by being optimistic.  Norem spends a good deal of time making the important distinction between the defensive pessimist and other forms of pessimism that are truly debilitating.<br />&quot;The Positive Power of Negative Thinking&quot; is not a 12-step program.    Instead, it is a highly accessible discussion of personality types and strategies for dealing with the anxiety that modern society brings.	2003-03-03

He conveys a sense of what magazine editors and other buyers of nature photography want in terms of quality, composition and subject through both his writing and many photographs.  Practical advice on the more mundane aspects of running a photography business and the submission process is given in a clear and concise manner.  Of note is his advice to start out by learning to write well so that you can submit full articles with photographs that are more likely to get published than stand-alone photos.  <br />This book is well recommended for people interested in making some money off their hobby, serious about making nature photography their career, or just curious as to how nature photographers earn a living.  The only drawback to the book is that it is a few years old and some of the material, particularly on digital photography and manipulation, is a bit dated.	2002-07-08

Taleb extends his lessons to somewhat broader avenues of life, but the strength of the book is in conveying the basics of his view of quantitative finance.   His discussions of the limitations human emotions put on trading rationally and how social context determines ones notion of success are also very good.<br />While Taleb has some clearly valid criticisms to make of academic financial theories, it should be pointed out that the assumption underlying his own trading strategy - that of obtaining larger gains when betting on rare events than losses when betting against likely events - may also change.   One needs to understand that models and theories are approximations to the truth.   His statement that Newtonian physics is \\"wrong\\" gets to the heart of the matter.  High-rise buildings are designed just fine without general relativity.  In this context, Newton's laws are as right as they need to be.  And insofar as the context of Black-Scholes type models hold, they are useful as well and provide something for further theory to build upon.  That widespread use of strategies based on a financial model in turn changes the system that was originally modeled is a unique pitfall that also needs notice.<br />\\"Fooled by Randomness\\" is somewhat meandering, but I nonetheless found the book to flow quite fluidly.  I enjoyed his writing style, even if he was at times a bit pompous (I particularly liked his use of George Will as a whipping boy.)  As a non-quantitative book, \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" is an accessible way to hear the worthwhile things Taleb has to say.	2002-06-23

Interspersed between the articles are sections of photographs.  Each article is cross-listed with relevant photographs, and vice-verse.  This cross listing is an effective device; coming back to various photographs as I read the essays forced me to really think about them.      <br />The first section deals with \\"creative and cognitive processes.\\"  These range from the inner desire needed to go out and get that shot to an almost scholarly examination - complete with annotated bibliography - of the processes involved in human sight and the differences between what people see and what film records.  I found this section to be the strongest aspect of the book as well as the most useful and interesting. <br />The second section consists mainly of technical material ranging from how to pack your gear to ways to use flash in outdoor settings.  It is pitched at a higher level than an introductory photo guide, suitable for an advanced novice like myself.  <br />The third section is primarily a collection of travel stories, often only tangentially touching on photography.   However, these articles provide the context in which many of the photographs in the book were taken.  Arguably, context is the crux of photography.  As Rowell points out, photographs are used to tell a story - though maybe not the one intended by the photographer.  <br />The last section conveys Rowell's view on the positive and negative effects that photography and outdoor travel have on the natural environment, as well as on the art of color outdoor photography vis-à-vis fine art photography.  These essays are thought provoking and, like the rest of the book, very well written.<br />I had feared from the title that I was in for a bunch of pseudo-spiritual babble, but instead I found a fairly deep, if meandering, discussion of the spectrum of what outdoor photography involves.	2002-05-30

Sacco's path takes him through much of the West Bank, Gaza, Jerusalem and parts of Israel.  He tells the stories of the people he meets and through them paints a picture of the brutality and injustice they endure under the apartheid policies of Israel.  With the media coverage of the conflict being what it is, the accessibility of the graphic novel format makes \\"Palestine\\" a singularly important work.  By communicating the truth, perhaps a lasting solution to this conflict can be found. <br />Although the journalistic content of \\"Palestine\\" is its primary value, it also stands on its own aesthetically.

In addition to the photographs, the volume contains valuable histories of early photography in Iran, the career of Antoin Sevruguin, and how the collection itself came about.  The double entendre of the title refers to how Sevruguin's art was informed by and catered to the Orientalist tastes of a Europe in which he was educated.   Yet as an Armenian Christian who was born, lived, died and was buried in Tehran, he presented a different image of Iran than the typical Orientalist photographers of the day.   &quot;Sevruguin and the Persian Image&quot; is both a solid examination of a photographer's art as well as a thoughtful analysis of the Western image of Iran in the late nineteenth century.	2002-01-05

His central thesis is that environmental factors were the primary driving force in social evolution.   This thesis is developed through the examination of a slew of ecological factors such as the various availability of plant and animal species suitable for domestication, as well as geographical factors such as continental size and orientation, and ease of migration.  <br />Diamond's motivation is to debunk a racist explanation of history.  For that it seems sufficient to cite the different races within Eurasia that have at one point or another &quot;led&quot; in technological and political development within a time frame too short for genetic change to be the explanation.   Diamond does not extend his thesis to within Eurasia, but rather gives a brief and rather weak explanation in the epilogue that poor land use caused southwestern Asian societies to lag and accidents of politics did the same for China.<br />Diamond is not the best writer.  While necessary, the application of his thesis to each continent comes off as overly repetitious.  While this book could not have been written in the 50 pages cited in other reviews, a more compact exposition would have been welcome and perhaps would have left room for a more thorough examination of the differences in societal development within Eurasia.  None the less, Guns, Germs &amp; Steel adds greatly to the popular literature on social evolution.	2001-12-31

His clear and casual writing style makes the book fun to read and the concepts easy to understand.<br />Norton first discusses a range of general issues such as lighting, lens choice, composition, films, etc.  A section on impressionistic rendering is quite interesting and gives a different perspective from what is normally taught.  He then discusses specific cases in more detail: wildlife, travel, landscape, closeup and underwater photography.  An additional section on photographing ones immediate surroundings once again provides a different twist.  <br />Norton provides enough charts and technical material to make a useful reference text.  The section on lens choice - with advice on the effective use of wide-angles and telephotos - helped me quite a bit.  <br />I found his view of compositional rules to be the most interesting aspect of the book.  Instead of rigid rules that would result in everyone taking the same pictures of the same things, he tries to provide some intuition into what makes for good composition.  Even in one of his own examples there is some latitude.  In the pair of shots of a racing sailboat, one picture has the boat heeled a bit more, giving the greater sense of motion he mentions.  In the other shot the boat is surrounded by the sails of its competitors.  This may only clutter the scene, or, worse yet, further the impression that the boat is parked.  However, to someone familiar with the sport, it can evoke the flurry of activity that marks the start of a race.	2001-05-30

Jacques Hadamard, a prominent mathematician, wrote this psychology text over 50 years ago, after having done his best work 50 years prior.   Although in some ways dated, both in content and in writing style, the book provides an interesting examination of the role of the conscious and subconscious in solving a problem, particularly the process of incubation and (seemingly) sudden inspiration.   He brings up the roles intuition and logic play in the way various mathematicians go about their business.  Hadamard also examines the influence of aesthetics in not just choosing a problem, but in solving it.   He studies the choice of research direction, with the interesting comment that Hadamard himself avoided areas of research where there was already a great deal of activity.<br />The book is short enough that if the subject interests you, it is worth your time.<br />The text is also published under the title &quot;The Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field.&quot;	2001-04-02

Jacques Hadamard, a prominent mathematician, wrote this psychology text over 50 years ago, after having done his best work 50 years prior. Although in some ways dated, both in content and in writing style, the book provides an interesting examination of the role of the conscious and subconscious in solving a problem, particularly the process of incubation and (seemingly) sudden inspiration. He brings up the roles intuition and logic play in the way various mathematicians go about their business. Hadamard also examines the influence of aesthetics in not just choosing a problem, but in solving it.

The character development is the strongest aspect of the book and the situational comedy is also very good.  I recently read A Confederacy of Dunces; these two novels share many qualities.<br />My Uncle Napoleon gives a portrayal of Iran that is very different from what is provided by the mainstream press.  While the aristocratic characters belong to a place and time that is  long gone, the mannerisms and character types satirized in the book are still present to some degree in many Iranians.  <br />Read this book if you want a good laugh or a glimpse of Iranian culture you could not otherwise get.	2001-02-12

Bowling Alone studies the disintegration of American community and its consequences.  The first and largest section deals with documenting this collapse.  This section is full of interesting statistics, but is not the most important part of the book.  I believe very few people would doubt that as a society we are becoming more disconnected from one another. <br />The second section speculates as to what is causing this change for the worse, bringing up such factors as longer hours at work, urban sprawl and the negative effects of mass media, particularly television.  One factor Putnam discusses, generational change, may be more of a symptom than a cause of the collapse of community.  Understanding what has caused the loss of community in America is possibly the most difficult aspect of the book.  None the less, I wish it could have been expanded.<br />The third section deals with the consequences, from the more obvious effects on neighborhoods and schools, to our economic prosperity and individual health and happiness.  The effect of a loss of community on our democracy is also documented.  The increased use of professional campaign staff to replace volunteers and the need for corporate and other special interest money to maintain this form of &quot;democracy&quot; is a profound danger.  This section is the most chilling part of the book and is the most important reason to read Bowling Alone.<br />The fourth section deals with remedies for our predicament.  The strongest part of this section is the comparison between our turn of the century and the previous one where we went from the Gilded Age to the Progressive Era.  In this section and the end of the previous one, some negative forms of community are discussed.  These are institutions that are exclusive in nature and have negatively contributed to people's images of what it means to be a &quot;joiner.&quot;  Putnam effectively distinguishes between the type of community organization whose effect is positive and these others.<br />Bowling Alone is a somewhat scholarly work and not pure entertainment.  But it is important and enlightening and will hopefully contribute to the revival of American community that it seeks.	2000-10-23

After reading  through On to C++, I became a big fan of Patrick Henry Winston.  Like On to  C++, On to Java is extremely well written and allows one to quickly convert  knowledge of C++ into knowledge of Java, although knowledge of C++ is not  required to use this book.<br />The breakdown of the book into small tutorial  bites is one of its strengths, but as a result makes On to Java not very  comprehensive.  None the less, the book covers all of the basics of the  language quite well. The use of essentially the same example throughout the  book strengthens it as a tutorial, but weakens it somewhat as a reference  text.	2000-08-04

The information is clearly presented and features such as tips in the margins make the book  easy to read as well as to use for later reference.  Both the technical  aspects of photography and photograph composition were discussed  succinctly.<br />Moreover, the book itself was entertaining reading and I  enjoyed the sections where various photographers' styles were showcased.  Not only were these sections useful in learning how to go about taking  pictures, they were interesting in their own right as glimpses into how  different artists work.	2000-06-05

The former  became the basis  for one of the best American novels, but the latter manifested itself in a  work that was incomplete on Maclean's death. <br />None the less, Young Men  and Fire is a powerful account of one man's efforts to come to terms with  tragedy.  At the outset Maclean attempts to understand the Mann Gulch fire  as a physical event involving flame and the death of the young  Smokejumpers.   His painstaking analysis is driven by an emotional need to  understand the event.   This process leads him ultimately  to seek a  spiritual understanding of the tragedy.  Maclean's narrative of working  with mathematicians who model fires for the Forest Service is the most  humanizing description of mathematics that I have ever read, despite  Maclean's eventual rejection of a reasoned analysis as a source of closure.  <br />Interestingly, Maclean was not directly involved in the incident, but  rather became attached to it through his memory of himself as a young  man  in the Forest Service.   To feel so strongly about something to which one  only has an abstract connection is remarkable.	2000-05-19

Some of the many powerful themes running through the story include the struggle for grace represented by the  art of fly fishing, the ebb and flow of time, and the idea of family.<br />It  is the examination of family that is perhaps strongest.   While the  relationships between father and son, mother and son, and husband and  wife  are all dealt with, it is the filial duties and relationships that are  ultimately the centerpiece of the story.  It is Maclean's  haunting by what  happens to his brother that makes the novel what it is. <br />Barry Moser's  illustrations are superb and are a compelling reason to own the hardcover  addition. The movie version was well done and did justice to the novel.	2000-05-16

My first encounter with the Shahnameh was in  high school where I was informed that the story of Rostam and Sohrab  indicates an Iranian penchant for treachery.  A Viking romance with  essentially the same story somehow does not indicate the same for  Norwegians.<br />It is hoped that Epic &amp; Sedition will bring more  attention to this great piece of world literature or at the very least  dispell some of the more extreme Orientalist analyses of the poem.	2000-05-11

While her representation of Iranian society as a duality between Islamic and Persian culture is somewhat simplistic, it should nonetheless help readers to understand that  there is a great deal more to Iran than militant Islam.   The Iranians is  well written and accessible.  Even though at times Mackey tends to  over-romanticize Iranian history and culture, this work does provide an  antidote to the current demonizations that persist in many Americans' view  of Iran.	2000-05-03

I particularly enjoyed the humanizing portrayal of the  mathematics involved in risk assessment.  The section on financial  derivatives I think will help the public at large understand the importance  and utility of these instruments, despite their ability to be abused.<br />One  drawback of the book was that the mathematics was not always presented  clearly.   This is the case with the discussion of regression to the mean,  where we are left with an impression that it is easier to get heads after  tails is tossed.  The representation of Chaos Theory as a belief system and  not a science subject is also troubling. <br />Note:  &quot;Mohammedan&quot;  is a derogatory term and Omar Khayyam was Persian, not Arab.	2000-04-05
