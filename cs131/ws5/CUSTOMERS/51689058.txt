I agree with some other readers, who point out weaknesses such as introducing us to the Navy pilot as if he's going to be a major character -- then killing him off. But there's no point in rehashing other people's points. My main criticism is that the author's not a very good writer of scenes. The dialogue between the joint chiefs and their advisors, the president, etc., just didn't seem very realistic. As to the reader who challenged critics of the book &quot;why don't you try to write a book yourself&quot; or words to that effect: just because I don't have the skill to be a good novelist doesn't mean I'm unqualified to recognize that others don't have the skill either.	2002-03-17

One is that his \\"contributor\\", Bowden, uses some phrases ad nauseam. I don't know how many times we read that Jack finished the third round 3 shots \\"adrift\\" of the leader. Not trailing by three, or behind by three, but \\"adrift\\" by three. Using that term for variety is okay, but it's used to death. I think he's a golfer, not a sailor.<br />Again, though, that's a minor distraction that doesn't take away from the enjoyment of reading about the greatest.	2002-03-13

But the descriptions of the players could have fit those at almost any school: focusing on football, alcohol, and sex. They did not seem more religious than any other college student; they wanted to win championships as much as any other college football player; they didn't seem to particularly burn the midnight oil (not studying, anyway). Their main distinction was that they weren't big enough to play on Division I teams. One other criticism: I could have done without getting to know Murphy's brothers, who had about the same maturity level as his son Devin.<br />But those are small quibbles. Murphy's narrative made me want to know Gagliardi, and made me want to walk on the campus of St. John's. Or should I say that he almost enabled me to do both simply by reading the book. That's good writing.	2002-03-13

Who was it who said something to the effect that anyone who wants to be president is, because of that desire, unfit to hold the office? Perhaps the more one desires it, the less fit one is. And has anyone ever wanted it more than Bill (and now, Hillary?).<br />The second quote -- or paraphrase, since I don't have the article at hand -- comes from George Will, who said that Bill Clinton was not the worst president we've ever had, but was the worst man to ever hold the office. Olson's book well supports his contention.	2002-03-10

Of course that's a time-honored practice, but I've never liked the idea of someone putting his name on a book he didn't write. \\"Written with so-and-so\\" would have been more honest.<br />Second, MJ was a great sprinter, but I don't think I'm the only one who suspects he feigned injury in that 150-meter match race with the 100-meter Olympic champ from Canada. Johnson saw him beginning to pass, realized he was going to lose both the race and some of his aura, and took the only way out that would allow him to retain superman status. It was a disappointing incident in an otherwise great career. (Although even the rest of his career must be taken with a grain of salt: Sports Illustrated published a story a few years back suggesting that no one can win track and field gold without taking performance enhancing drugs. One look at Johnson's sculpted shoulders, biceps, triceps, etc., supports this view. Would a sprinter do the kind of upper-body weight training that would yield these muscles? Or are they a by-product of steroids? If he took illegal stuff and tanked the match race, it sort of takes the power away from this book).	2002-03-05

I agree with the reviewer below who contrasted this book with Hunt for Red October. That was a masterful story, and it shares little with this one; the story was much more concise, Ryan had not yet evolved into Superman -- it was superior in every way.<br />I have come to realize that Ryan is an excellent storyteller, but not much of a writer. For example, all of his good guys talk the same way. Who said this to President Ryan, when he said he hated his job: &quot;Ain't supposed to be fun, Jack.&quot; Was it Robby Jackson, Arnie Van Damm, George Winston, Cathy Ryan, Ding Chavez, Mary Pat Foley, etc.? My point is that the words fit all of them perfectly, because they all talk with Clancy's one &quot;good guy&quot; voice.<br />I could give lots more criticism, but I'll close by agreeing with another reviewer who complained about the Foley's &quot;baby-honey bunny&quot; act. Are they the two top intelligence agents, or sitcom characters?<br />Tom -- take a break, stop writing, and enjoy all that money.	2001-11-18

If you haven't read Hunt for Red October in a while, revisit it. You will find a Jack Ryan who is clever, brave, etc. -- but not the demigod he has evolved into. Why do Clancy's heroes all have to be so superhuman? Ryan is not just brave, but the bravest; the most brilliant (making millions in the market was too easy for him, remember?); the most righteous in every way. His wife can't just be a surgeon -- she has to be the top eye surgeon in the world, while also being young and sexy. Jack's buddy Robby can't just be a fighter pilot -- he has to be a top gun, rising to admiral etc. Even Robby's wife can't just be the wife of a Navy pilot -- she has to be a concert pianist. The peripheral heroes and heroines are likewise too perfect. It just gets tiresome after all these books.<br />On the other hand, we could certainly use Jack, Robby, Clark, Ding, etc., in these dark days. But maybe that's another reason Clancy has become a little tiresome: in real life, our leaders and secret operatives just can't do what the storybook characters can.	2001-09-20

It is a common occurrence for me to pick up a book in &quot;New Books&quot; at the library, read a chapter or two, and stop -- astonished by the fact that such awful stuff gets published. But Sparks' book held my attention and I finished it at one sitting. My assessment: Fair to good.<br />However, I have a few comments. First, it is definitely a &quot;chick book&quot; (my wife will love it). In fact, a cynical person might suggest that Sparks has simply discovered a formula to make female readers smile and cry on cue, and is cashing in on the formula big time.<br />Second, the writing style is confusing, if not downright bad. What I mean is that the story's narrator is 57 years old, recalling the events of his 17th year -- yet his speaking style is clearly that of the 17-year old, not the mature man. (Not that it's fair to compare this book with &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, but recall that the narrator of that story was a mature woman and spoke accordingly; she didn't relate her tale in the voice of young Scout).<br />Still, I give it 4 stars just because I enjoyed the story.	2001-07-11

If &quot;Dragons&quot; is right, it may be centuries or millenia before we make contact with extraterrestrial species. (And bear in mind the argument that has been made by several writers before: If there are intelligent species in the galaxy, many of them would be tens or hundreds of thousands of years more advanced than we. Presumably, then, some of them would have found us by now. Yet all of them choose to remain hidden -- why? Just another question without an answer).	2001-05-31

The section focusing on Lucy, Jules, and Johnny Fontaine just seems a little out of place to me. It's true that those characters connect to plot developments in the second half of the book, but the refocusing away from the Corleones seems to go on too long and in too much detail. Perhaps I just need to read the book a second time to understand why Puzo did this.<br />But there's just no denying the gripping nature of this story. Puzo's narrative is so convincing that it seems to be a description of real people and events. How accurate a picture is this story? I have no idea. But it makes for a great read.	2001-05-29

Political correctness has invaded children's literature in a big way. If you have any doubts about that, peruse the &quot;new books&quot; shelf in the juvenile section of your local library.<br />That's why it was refreshing to see that Zindel provided a reasonably balanced presentation of the pros and cons of the use of the A-bomb to end the war. The protagonist, young Stephen, was used by Zindel to give the &quot;con&quot; view (not completely realistically; it's unlikely that a child would immediately grasp all the implications and give all the usual suggestions about alternatives to using the bomb -- making a &quot;demonstration drop&quot; in the ocean, for example). But the character of Stephen's father was used to expound the reasons the bomb, horrible as it was, needed to be used.<br />My own view is that the use of the bomb was necessary and justifiable. But whether the young readers of this book agree with me or not, I am pleased that they are being given something to think about -- rather than being fed blatant propaganda.	2001-05-16

Many of the reviewers have become quite worked up over what they perceive to be unpardonable errors of science on the part of Crichton. They should repeat this phrase a hundred times: &quot;It's FICTION.&quot;<br />Likewise, many got bent out of shape over various questions such as: How did the travellers get &quot;reconstructed&quot; at the other end? How did the professor's message cross universes? etc. A careful reading shows that most of these questions were answered by Crichton. You may consider his answers glib or unconvincing, but -- again -- it's FICTION.<br />Like Jurassic Park, this book is really two stories: A fascinating quasi-scientific theory, well described by Crichton, and an action-adventure yarn. Of the two parts, I preferred the former. But the adventure part wasn't that bad, either.<br />In summary, there's a lot to criticize about this book -- as there was with Jurassic Park. But both books are page-turners, pure and simple.<br />(Now Airframe, on the other hand -- don't get me started!)	2001-05-16

I suspect more than one reader has been taken in over the years by the pseudo-documentary narrative. If so it's almost understandable; the story seems entirely plausible.<br />(For that matter, who's to say there's not a Wildfire-type facility, or that there wasn't an incident like this at some time?

Children gifted with paranormal abilities, possibly of extraterrestrial origin, are held captive by scientists whose desire to study and exploit these phenomena leave them little inclination to treat the children as anything other than valuable lab rats. Of course there are one or two sympathetic adults (e.g., Granny Islington, who could have been an interesting character if the author had tried to develop her a bit more). But if you've read juvenile sci-fi before, you've read stories like this one a dozen times.<br />About the only interest I found was in the locale -- the story takes place in Dallas, where I have lived for many years. But even that angle is skimped on by the author (who lives in the suburb of Plano); his description of the Dallas Art Museum was so vague as to give no flavor to the story at all. Likewise, the lake in the first chapter (White Rock, perhaps -- the author doesn't name it) might as well be any lake in any city. And of course if you don't live in Dallas, you won't even have that aspect to hold your interest in this mediocre story.	2001-03-04

But this book is not well put together; the narrative switches back and forth from Jack's first-person reminiscing to his daughter Joan's observations -- and it's often difficult to tell the switch has happened until you're several sentences or paragraphs into the new section. If Joan's comments had been put in italics or otherwise set apart, it would have been much better. Also, Joan occasionally went a bit too far in relating her own life story, forgetting that it was only where her memories shed light on Jack that they were appropriately included in this book.

For that matter, has Raymond Benson read any of the Fleming novels? This book is such a pathetic mess that I can only conclude you people have never read the real thing.<br />On second thought, Benson must have read the originals, because he keeps stealing from them -- but very, very badly. Did you enjoy the description of Bond's meal with Vesper in Casino Royale, or the time Bond gorged on crab and pink champagne in one of the other books whose name escapes me? Well, Benson enjoyed it, too. So he decided to write his own version. And we get... Bond eating Tex-Mex in Austin! Or, speaking of Casino Royale, didn't you love the masterful narrative of Bond's heroic battle against Le Chiffre at the baccarat table? Again, so did Benson -- so he drops in a ridiculous Readers Digest version of the same scene in this book.<br />Some of this might be forgiveable if Benson could write better than the average high schooler.<br />No, not even then would it be forgiveable, because then we'd only have a better-written but still poorly conceived story.	2001-02-18

Oh, fall back!&quot; Can you really imagine someone saying it that way?). Also, you may forgive the social/political angle of the second book, but the denouement seems very rushed, as if the authors had to speed up to meet a deadline.<br />But the descriptions of Bronson Beta and its cities, by themselves, make this story well worth reading.

But Asimov was always more about quantity than quality. He never stopped writing, but he should have stopped from time to time; there was just no way he could keep the quality steady while churning out pages and pages by the dozen. (In fact, if you read other &quot;Black Widowers&quot; volumes, you will find notes by Asimov accompanying the stories. Often there will be a note to the effect that a particular story was rejected for publication in one of the mystery magazines. Apparently it never occurred to Asimov that perhaps the editors were right, and the story wasn't fit for publication).	2000-12-04
US	51689058	R2QCHE1MBGK27R	055327340X	984749929	Fantastic Voyage II	Books	1	0	1	N	N	Face it -- a lot of Asimov's writing was junk.	And this book is an example. In the intro, Asimov says he was never satisfied with the original Fantastic Voyage novel, because it wasn't his story. So he was thrilled to have a chance to write his own story on the theme.<br />Too bad his own story wasn't any good. It is illustrative of an often-overlooked fact: Asimov was mostly about quantity, not quality. It's well known that he was a prolific writer. It's less well known that most of what he wrote wasn't really worth reading.	2000-09-23

The earlier reviewer is right -- this is  without a doubt, and by far, the best book on pro football ever written. It  is very engaging, informative, and humorous.<br />(With due respect to Kramer,  I suspect that Schaap is probably 90% responsible for the excellence of the  book. His writing brings about the result I alluded to in my first  sentence).	2000-09-05

The most common thing I see is people who reject a particular doctrine,  Scriptural passage, or the like, because they know &quot;God wouldn't do  that&quot;. And how do they know? Because THEY wouldn't do that if THEY  were God. Yes, their God is too small; and probably so is yours and mine.  Reading this book will help us realize how great he is.	2000-08-20

The preaching on gun control and socialized medicine marred an otherwise  amusing and, at times, charming story.<br />One other criticism; I'm sure most  readers will recognize the implausibility of the protagonist's classmates'  responses to his decision to change his name to &quot;Blue Avenger&quot;  and even to wear a costume to school. Sorry, but that would just be begging  for ridicule, if not outright tormenting from other kids.	2000-08-19

Clarke should have left well enough alone. 2001, 2010, and 2061 were all fascinating stories. 3001 appears to be little more than a Clarke  manifesto, full of his not-too-subtle preaching on various subjects (it's  one thing for him to be a vegetarian or vegan or whatever he is; quite  another to go on and on about &quot;corpse food&quot;). If you've completed  the trilogy, leave it at that and pass this one up.	2000-08-16

The true measure of greatness for books written for children or teens is  whether they are worthy of being read by adults as well. This book fails  the test. I enjoyed it immensely as a young teen, and when I ran across a  copy 20 years later I was eager to read it again. The story just didn't  work any more, for reasons that others have pointed out below -- so I won't  repeat them.	2000-08-09

They have stood the test of time.<br />A reviewer below alluded  to a comment by Isaac Asimov that alien races advanced enough to cross the  galaxy would also be more emotionally and morally advanced, and therefore  would never think of conquering other worlds. If Asimove said this, it  confirms my long-held belief that he was a pompous blowhard. Technological  advances = moral advances? Right -- that explains why we are so much more  morally developed than the Stone Age people. A much better reason not to  fear alien invasion is that, if there are other civilizations out there  (read &quot;Rare Earth&quot; if you think that's a given, by the way), many  of them would be thousands of years older than ours, and therefore would  have found us long before now. If they haven't invaded yet, they probably  won't.	2000-08-05

Clancy (like Michael Crichton with &quot;Andromeda Strain&quot;) peaked with his first book. Although most of Clancy's book are far superior to those of his many imitators, the sequels to HFRO have been a failed effort  to capture the magic of his early masterpiece.<br />If you've enjoyed Clancy's  books over the years, I highly recommend you re-read HFRO, his magnum  opus.<br />[Note: one of the many ways in which HFRO is superior to the  sequels: Jack Ryan is presented as a very smart and courageous agent -- but  not as the superman (if not demigod) he became in later books!]	2000-07-24

I agree with other reviewers who suggest that, even if you're not into the allegorical aspect of the book, it is worth reading for the stunning descriptions of an alien planet. I've read the book several times; the most  enjoyable was while on summer vacation in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado.  Reading about the green seas and golden skies, the variegated floating  islands, the bubble trees, etc., while surrounded by the wondrous beauty of  our own world, was a profoundly enjoyable experience.	2000-07-16

This is a democratic republic, not a monarchy. JFK Sr. was not a king. Junior was not a prince. He was little more than a wealthy celebrity, having more in  common with Hollywood actors than with people who have some importance in  society. Those of you who wept when &quot;Di&quot; died may love this book.  The rest of you (those who have a life) should pass on the book.	2000-07-16

But despite the dedication and perseverance of Mrs. Zajac, I was left feeling that -- contrary to what some reviewers here have maintained -- she didn't have all  that much lasting influence on the children's lives. The kids are now in  their early 20's; don't you suspect Clarence has been in trouble with the  law many times by now? That Robert has had serious problems as well? That  Alice is probably in college or a recent graduate, with good prospects  ahead? How would any of those outcomes be different without Mrs.  Zajac?<br />Don't take this as criticism of Mrs. Zajac! I would be pleased to  have her teach my kids. I just think the odds are stacked high against her  because of the system in which she works (or worked).<br />One reader review  from a teacher made me laugh --something to the effect that Kidder can't  provide a good picture of public education because he hasn't worked in it!  The reviewer is making the classic teachers' union claim, that only  teachers understand education. In fact, though there are many good  teachers, there are also many, many poor ones (another teacher/reviewer's  message contained grammatical errors). Those unqualified teachers are part  of the huge problem that is public education in the United States.	2000-07-15

They were written about the same time period, but present two pretty different views of pro football players. Was Kramer's version sanitized, or  was Gent's exaggerated?<br />By the way, the standard disclaimer in Gent's  book (&quot;any similarity to real persons is coincidental&quot; etc.) is,  in this case, a joke.

Aside from the questions raised by other reviewers as to scientific credibility, the real question to me is: would people awaiting doom continue to act as thoroughly civilized as did the characters in this  story? Seems doubtful to me; nevertheless, On the Beach was a fascinating  story, moody and thought-provoking.	2000-06-24

The futuristic setting, the action/survival theme, even a hint of sexual tension -- what more could a teenage boy want in a book? And if it sounds as if I'm being  tongue-in-cheek, I'm really not. I loved this book as a teen, and got a lot  of enjoyment reading it again a couple of decades later.	2000-06-18

Like many of the reviewers below, I loved this book as a child; was delighted to find it and read it again as an adult; and was pleased to introduce my children to the book. So there's just one reason for me to add  my review: commenting on the sequels that some others have mentioned. My  view is that the reader should stop after the first book. The first sequel  is barely okay; the ones that follow don't measure up. Only the original  &quot;Wonderful Flight&quot; has the magic.	2000-06-17

It is one of the great stories of human ingenuity, determination, and courage.<br />One thing that struck me in reading this book was the brilliant leadership of &quot;Big X&quot;, the  late Roger Bushell. Those of you in management positions who think you are  hot stuff because you are paid a lot to manage some systems project or some  group of clerical people should read this book to find out what a real  manager of a real &quot;project&quot; is like.	2000-06-15

This is a fascinating topic and the authors did a good job of explaining their thesis. For the lay reader, however, some parts may be a bit technical and explained in too much detail. I almost think this could have  been better presented to the non-scientist reader as a long magazine  article rather than a full book.<br />However, that is minor criticism; there  were many intriguing ideas presented in this book. And I should really give  it 5 stars -- the extra star awarded to the authors for debunking the ideas  of that pompous populist, Carl Sagan (I can just hear him  saying...&quot;Only one civilization in the galaxy? NO! Billions and  billions and billions...&quot;).	2000-06-14

This one seemed to hang on a flimsier thread than most.

The payoff was just never there as far as  I'm concerned.	2000-05-01

There are  some marked differences, but both the book and movie versions seem  appropriate to the overall mood of the story.	2000-03-17
