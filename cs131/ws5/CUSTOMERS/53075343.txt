The hardcover, larger-print (not really large), NKJV MacArthur study bible is great on content and the type-size easier on the eyes, even if your vision is fine.      Unfortunately, it's printed on thin \\"see through\\" tissue-paper. The print on the other side is a distraction that has to be filtered out. For a study bible, thinness needn't be a driving factor compromising legibility.    The format could have been great, but slightly fell short of what the intended usage deserves.	2005-10-06
US	53075343	RLUZ9KVR826EQ	1885767293	444753113	Persuasions: A Dream of Reason Meeting Unbelief	Books	5	5	6	N	Y	Effective conversations with unbelief	The book has 3 main virtues: it's short, smart, and gentle.  The result shows how Christian thought can surround and correct external challengers ... and also  internal deviations. <br /> <br />The thirteen topics are: immorality, antinomianism (the belief faith is sufficent for salvation, freeing Chrisitans from moral law), feminism, agnosticism, empty scholarship, atheism, election, marriage, hypocrisy in the church, salvation and sanctification, pantheism (New Age, etc.), evolution, Roman Cathoicism. <br /> <br />If for some reason none of these topics interests you, you will still profit by reading the book. 500-page apologetics books filled with footnotes, scholarly analysis, and invaluable data are vital, but putting them to effective use can be tricky.  Most criticism of Christianity comes from incorrect reasoning which can be readily fixed by simply comparing it with correct reasoning. Which this book does. <br /> <br />The book's dialogues are practical ... they follow the flow of objections and criticisms anyone who has engaged unbelief will recognize, just as a fisherman learns to recognize the twitches on the line. <br /> <br />They are not fake dialogues designed to make response easy, but the criticisms found in hundreds of books, taught in colleges and many modern seminaries, and every time you flip on the TV, go to a movie, or read the newspaper. <br /> <br />Finally, the book avoids a harsh approach. They really are conversations \\"on the road\\" -- the imagery itself providing some \\"minds-eye relief\\" compared to, say, a treatise on symbolic logic.  <br /> <br />In the end, if their objections flow only from what they believe is well-founded reason, those conversing with the Evangelist would be left with no avenue but graceful surrender. But pride and sin still have to be dealt with and, in the book, this means the people sometime just walk away.  <br /> <br />Real-world application of these arguments is more likely to be met with emotionalism and rage, so things won't be so smooth, even if you are gentle. <br /> <br />I remember one time I found myself just talking in circles with one civil, proudly rational person. I was never able to progress despite careful explanations in many different ways. I then started asking him to repeat the sentence I just said to verify he was hearing and understanding me.  He wasn't even able to bring himself to repeat the words, but had to alter them ... and refused to acknowledge he was altering them. We just kept going round and round and round. So pride and sin are still the main problems, not reason, but there are many others for who the reasoned arguments of this book will be very helpful.	2005-05-29
US	53075343	R29EHLDT8RQBAV	0374281580	481407616	I Am Charlotte Simmons: A Novel	Books	3	10	14	N	Y	It's about the books' subject, not it's "literary style" ...	A riveting read, at least for for me, since the central character and situation reminded me so of a young woman I knew in college in the early 1990's, even to details like the fluffy \\"hand-grenade\\" down jacket. I would say the author nailed it. <br /> <br />Charlotte Simmons scored perfect SAT's and perfect scores on four advance placement tests. One of 100 Presidential Scholars, Valedictorian, cross-country star and beautiful, she is admitted to to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and fictional Dupont on full scholarhsip. She departs her rural red-neck community and heads to Dupont with little more than a southern drawl and high hopes for a life of the mind at the Great Institution. <br /> <br />The book follows her rapid Fall upon arrival; from disciplined, focused jewel of civilization who rocked her Nobel prize-winning professor with an original critique of Darwinism (after reading Origin of Species in both French AND English) to, after three months of exposure to college culture, voluntarily drunk in a hotel room with depraved fraternity boys, publicly behaving in ways even animals don't. And, afterward, longing for death as she tries to hide her academic collapse and spiritual destruction from her rural parents and community who held such high hopes for her... <br /> <br />The end was sad, with Charlotte eventually accepting the squandering of her gifts in exchange for the approval of strangers, comforting herself with the idea the soul is an illusion, just a ghost in the materialistic machine that is Charlotte Simmons. <br /> <br />I'll dispute what some reviews have said: there's nothing funny or satirical about this \\"fiction\\". It describes individual tragedy and slow-motion cultural suicide. If you don't want to spend your time on a tragedy with foul language, debased animalistic behavior, explicit sex, skip the book, 'cause that's what it is.  But if you are thinking of sending your children to college, you might want to hold your nose and wade through it. <br /><br />Those who wonder why the big deal over losing one's virginity (\\"hey, it's common in junior high -- what's the big deal?\\") say this from a position of corruption.  The reason society doesn't want young unmarried people having sex is explicit in the book; the young are easily enslaved by sensation without ever getting the chance to know how unimportant it is. Distracted from achieving their full human potential in exchange for the same simple but engrossing experience a pair of rabbits or roaches might have, society and the individual lose. Not just intellectually: it weakens future marriage by depriving the couple of a unique bond. So we get 50% of people under the age of 25 having a sexually transmitted disease and divorce, creating more problems for the next generation even as they congratulate themselves on how enlightened they are. The evidence shows the opposite. <br /> <br />The insensitivity to this shown in some reviews IS what the book is about: normal being redefined to the lowest common denominator. The hard fought basis of civilization being eroded away from underneath as the \\"best and brightest\\", future leaders, are acculturated  at institutes of \\"higher learning\\" to accept perversions as being as normal as gravity, unable to recognize or participate in anything higher. \\"Full human potential? Say what??\\" <br /> <br />College students, you have been lied to by MTV, Hugh Hefner, Kinsey, your schools.  If you could realize the magnitude of the lie you have been fed, it would stagger you.  Those people want you enslaved and addicted.  If you go to your first college kegger thinking it will mean you are all grown up and \\"free\\", it is actually quite the opposite. You are slipping on chains you probably will never break. <br /> <br />Charlotte was embarrassed by her parents, her accent, her rural upbringing, when in fact she was superior to the self-corrupted elite in every way. People should stop being impressed by the worldy-wise.  Most modern institutions of higher learning (Harvard, Yale, Princeton, etc.), are sick and should not be respected, deferred to or supported. They are spiritually deforming and destroying students, producing people who have more in common with pre-civilization barbarians than future pillars. Imagine spending $60,000 a year -- putting yourself in financial servitude -- to get an education that only debases and disfigures your mind and spirit, preparing you only for spiritual servitude. <br /> <br />The book is not about documenting new culture. It's about the fragility of civilization and how easily it can be stripped away if people do nothing and don't see things for what they are, and frankly, if they don't have a biblically based relationship with God.  Charlotte's mother may have had it, but it was seemingly not part of Charlotte's education, leaving her easy prey for the Worldy-Wise men and women committed to evil.	2005-01-24

To the young reviewer below who'se biggest concern amidst all this seems to be &#34;hypocrisy&#34;: hypocrisy means saying one thing and doing another. If people fail to live up to the standards they advance, it says nothing about the standards, just the person.  And Christianity understands all people to be so corrupted by sin as to be abhorrent in the sight of God.  Thus the need for the Savior. Charging hypocrisy is about as useful as commenting the book fell to the ground because of gravity.  The &#34;beliefs&#34; of the 20 people executed in Salem 400 years ago for witchcraft were church-going Christians; they were on the wrong side of local politics and hysteria and maybe even ergot poisoning.  Deaths of those 20 people would have been a slow morning to Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot, Stalin and the rest who sought to create man-made, scientific Utopia's free of Christian influence, resulting in the deaths of 200 million +.  It's interesting &#34;gays&#34; were mentioned, as Columbine is the direct, logical result of the arguments used to try and legitimize homosexuality. &#34;As long as people are consenting and no one is hurt&#34; is offered to replace God's law, biology and all of human history.  But WHY should people be consenting and so what if someone get's hurt?  Who are you to impose such Christian derived limitations on me?  If I want to hurt someone, who are you to tell me I can't?  The Columbine shooters simply carried the logic of modern culture to it's inevitable conclusion a few years ahead of the majority.  Living in a society which still has some Christian influence restrains most, but, increasingly, more will work out the implications of &#34;freedom of choice&#34; for themselves.  I don't know what kind of school you have been going to, but I don't think it has been doing well by you.  You seem unfamiliar with basic Christian teaching, yet claim to be surrounded by it.  Doesn't sound like it.	2004-02-16
US	53075343	R38EAAW7VIY3SO	097186800X	995558395	Solving the Exodus Mystery, Vol. 1: Discovery of the True Pharaohs of Joseph, Moses, and the Exodus	Books	5	59	62	N	N	Comprehensive and fascinating theory of the Exodus	This is an exhaustively detailed analysis of the historical basis of the biblical Exodus account.<br /><br />The author shows why Egyptian Sothic chronologies are wrong and unfixable and examines hundreds of aspects of the literature and archaeology. He finds 436 points of agreement between Biblical accounts and present-day archaeology, once the chronology is matched to uncalibrated radiocarbon dating and an eclipse. He compares his analysis with the consensus view and theories of Courville, Ailing, Rohl, Kitchen and Velikovsky.<br /><br />Most (but not all) archaeologists reject the historicity of the Exodus account. The walls of Jericho \\"fell 300 years before Joshua\\", there is \\"no evidence of Israel in Egypt or the Exodus\\", etc.<br /><br />Although this leaves the history of Israel practically inexplicable, many have found such scholarly declarations persuasive; reason enough to doubt the Biblical record and fall away from their faith.  After 24 years of studying the problem, the author demonstrates the discordance is due to systematically incorrect times being assigned to Egyptian dynasties #1-20.<br /><br />For much of its history, Egypt had a 365 day/yr calendar. Using observations of astronomically fixed risings of the star Sirius (recorded in Egyptian literature with calendar dates), a \\"Sothic\\" dating system was constructed. This provided the framework for Egyptian history, which itself became the source chronology for most of the region.<br /><br />Problem is, there were at least two times when Egypt switched between 360 and 365 day systems. There were also periods of 354/355 day calendars. This renders the Sothic system useless, a problem Egyptologists seem unaware of. For every year spent under a 360 day/yr calendar system, Sothic dates shift 20 years (compared to a 365 day/yr result). Since many decades were recorded under different calendars, and the switch points aren't known, Sothic dates actually spin through complete cycles, like a roulette wheel.<br/><br />There were many hints something was wrong; radiocarbon dates of wood in tombs were off. Since the astronomically fixed Sothic system was trusted as absolute, radiocarbon dates were adjusted (\\"calibrated\\") to agree.<br /><br />But when dates are moved backward 300 years (to match the unadjusted (unfudged) radiocarbon dating and an eclipse), the author finds 436 points of agreement between Biblical history and the 12th Dynasty history of Egypt and Mid-East. He identifies Sesotris I as Pharaoh of Joseph, Sesotris III as Pharaoh of the Oppression, Amenemhet III who drove Moses into exile and Amenemhet IV the Pharaoh whose crown now lies on the bottom of the Red Sea.<br /><br />The 12th dynasty was a peak of power for Egypt, but ended under obscure circumstances.  Amenemhet IV has no pyramid or tomb. He vanishes from record and his wife Soboknefru ascended to the throne (not his first-born son) in a period of great turmoil for 3 years until she was deposed.<br /><br />For a description of the time, there is the Leiden Papyrus 344, the writings of Ipuwer, a 12th Dynasty priest of the sun god Ra at Heliopolis. He laments social chaos in Egypt, describing 8 of the 10 plagues recorded in the Bible as well as a king \\"killed by pouring water\\". One of many interesting lines:<br /><br />\\"Lo, the hot-tempered say 'if I knew where god is I would serve him'...\\"<br /><br />As a pagan sun-worshipping society, Egyptians would know where their \\"god\\" was ... unless this is not a reference to their god ...<br /><br />Professional Egyptologists say this papyrus is non-historical. Why?  As the translator puts it, it's fiction because it is inherently contradictory. On the one hand, the land is said to suffer from total want; on the other hand, the poor are described as having become rich. The translator says this contradiction is \\"historically impossible\\". So that's that! Never mind the Biblical Exodus account explains it.<br /><br />Secular archaeologists start with the assumption that any document describing miracles or the supernatural is fictional. They reject the content to construct an alternate naturalistic version to explain it away. Instead of following the evidence, like the Leiden Papyrus, they discount it because it does not fit their anti-supernatural bias. They will instead tell you to your face there is no Egyptian record of the Exodus.<br /><br />In truth, even if such people witnessed the Exodus, there would be many who would deny it the next day, let alone 3500 years after the fact. Evidence of the truth the Exodus, an intervention of God in history not amenable to naturalistic explanation, undermines pride-and-power conceits of humans.<br /><br />The author, unlike myself, wisely refrains from such polemic interludes and the book's material is presented neutrally, if enthusiastically.<br /><br />The book could have used an editor; there is substantial repetition. The calendar discussion could be much clearer; if you don't know much about calendars and astronomy, you won't figure it out here. Being a key point, that's too bad. There is no index (but 100s of references to Egyptological literature).<br /><br />The book emphasizes documents. I recommend also \\"The Exodus Case\\" by Moller. This high-quality book has hundreds of photos relevant to the archaeology of the Exodus, such as from the floor of the Red Sea. Published in Sweden, Amazon does not sell it. Web searching will reveal the U.S. distributor in Wisconsin.<br /><br />A single point of history, or artifact, is subject to interpretation.  But when you have hundreds of them, they tend to fit together only one way, like a puzzle. Stewart may well have solved it, even if some details over-reach. It may take majority-archaeology years or decades to come to grips with this material, but there is no reason for you to wait...	2003-02-23

Books	5	21	25	N	N	Inspiring study of a discontinuity in human history	Almost 2000 years ago, Jesus of Nazareth was executed by Roman and Jewish authorities in the most humiliating manner of the time. His followers, who thought he was the promised Messiah, fled to the countryside, disbanding in confusion and despair at the death of their teacher.<br /><br />Yet within weeks, they began to publicly and confidently advance ideas and practices radically at odds with centuries of Jewish culture and teaching, establishing the foundations of the Christian church. In the years to follow, all were tormented and killed for advancing these beliefs.<br /><br />What happened to trigger this change, to reconstitute and energize the ministry of Jesus, and subsequently change the world?  People aren't willing to die for something if they know it to be a lie.<br /><br />The cause is given in the Bible; the physical resurrection of Jesus and subsequent interaction with not only his followers but hundreds of other witnesses on many occassions after an agonizing death on the cross.<br /><br />\\"Who Moved the Stone\\" analyzes the events of the week leading up to the execution of Jesus and the discovery of his resurrection. Four somewhat different views are provided by the four Gospels and Morison shows how each contributes a piece to the interlocking puzzle of events, enhancing the coherence and credibility of the resurrection precisely because of the way they fit together (and sometimes seem not to).<br /><br />This is a stimulating, well-written book everyone should appreciate and read, since it illuminates the foundational event of modern civilization. The author offers interesting inferences regarding the arrest of and formulation of charges against Jesus based on Jewish law of the time, Biblical accounts, who was involved and how it relates to historical practices. One begins to appreciate subtleties of the situation.<br /><br />The book ended without addressing all questions people might have, such as seeming variations between the gospels regarding who was in the open tomb and when.  A timeline that clearly harmonized all accounts (who was where when X happened, etc.) would have helped.  However, Wenham's book \\"Easter Enigma\\" does this completely.  William Lane Craig also has some excellent academic analysis such as \\"The Son Rises\\".<br /><br />All in all, this book is a fine introduction to the argument for the Resurrection of Jesus.	2003-02-10

The scrolls contained Egyptian symbols, some of which Smith said he recognized.<br /><br />Translation commenced and it was announced to the Mormon community the scrolls contained the writings of Abraham, the biblical founder of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Another was said to contain the writings of Joseph.<br /><br />Yet the scrolls told of very different things than the Bible; God justified deceit when a righteous purpose is served, Abraham is instructed in astronomy in which the heavens are explained as an eternal progression of pre-existing spirits. Certain men would be exalted and go on to become gods themselves. It taught there were a plurality of gods who created the universe. The scrolls offered  support to a variety of things Joseph Smith had been introducing to his teachings.<br /><br />However, at that time, there was no one in America who could read ancient Egyptian. The Rosetta Stone was found only a few years prior in the 1820's and the knowledge had not crossed the Atlantic.<br /><br />Eventually the translation was canonized in Mormon theology as the Book of Abraham, being placed at the same level of authority as the Book of Mormon.  The scrolls were thought destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire, but were rediscovered in 1967 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.<br /><br />When Egyptologists were able to examine them, they found Smith's translation was a fabrication; single symbols were translated by Smith in his notebooks as several paragraphs. For example, the Egyptian symbol for \\"born of\\" was \\"translated\\" by Smith into 3 paragraphs about a Chaldean famine.<br /><br />The books Smith said were the records of Abraham are actually a common pagan funeral papyrus, of relatively late date, known to Egyptologists as \\"The Book of Breathings\\" prepared between 50 BC and 50 AD for a priest name Hor, who served the Egyptian god Amon at Karnak. It was composed using Egyptian writing that didn't exist until 600 B.C., 12 centuries after the time of Abraham.<br /><br />The writings said to be from Joseph are a late copy of the Egyptian \\"Book of the Dead\\", prepared for a woman named Ta-Shert-Min.  The scrolls had nothing to do with Abraham or Joseph. Egyptologists see Smith's translation and interpretation of drawings in the scrolls as fiction.<br /><br />\\"By His Own Hand...\\" traces the history and analysis of the book of Abraham...<br /><br />The book is filled with photographs of Smith's translation notebook, the original scrolls, comparisons of the two, with extensive commentary from scholars of Egyptian studies. There is also a video documentary version sold at Amazon.com called \\"The Book of Abraham\\"...	2003-02-10

OK, name the 12 apostles. Chances are you can't. Disconcerting, no?  These twelve, who most Chistians think they know, took the teachings of Jesus and changed the world by establishing the Christian church.<br /><br />They were chosen from among hundreds of \\"disciples\\" (meaning learners or students) of Jesus to be apostles: \\"messengers, sent ones\\".  Who were they, why were they chosen, and why were they so successful?<br /><br />It's important to consider who Jesus did NOT select for his inner circle. He chose no rabbis, no scholars, no one from the religious establishment who could have given him an inside track to power and authority.  Instead, he picked a ragtag bunch of people who couldn't comprehend the power of God, struggled with their own sins, wrestled with the cost of committment and too often, to put it plainly, could be quite dense as to what was going on.<br /><br />Jesus taught them Scriptures and theology. He taught them how to pray, forgive, and serve one another with humility, gave them moral instruction, spoke to them of things to come, and used them to heal the sick and do other miracles. Three of them were given a  brief glimpse of His glory on the Mount of Transfiguration.<br /><br />In all, they had about 18 months of training and were then sent out on a mission too vast for any reasonable expectation of success.<br /><br />This book examines everything known about these quite ordinary people who achieved the extraordinary. It's a fresh and delightful read.	2003-02-10

What is one to make of a book that ignores 3000 years of work on the central topic so as to take matters resolved centuries ago and hype them up as novelty \\"gotchas\\"?<br /><br />By analogy, what would one make of a 6th grader sending a college physics department his proof that \\"E<>MC^2\\" because E, as the 5th letter, M as the 13th and C, the 2nd, don't add up? Seriously. It's that bad. The image of the author standing on the shore skipping stones across the surface of a deep ocean came to mind quickly.<br /><br />There is a field called \\"theology\\" for which it is historically and epistemologically correct to describe modern science and logic as being subsidiary branches.<br /><br />Most issues raised in the book have histories that extend back centuries or more. The author displays almost no awareness of this. The primary sources are atheists, agnostics and skeptics currently living. Most such people have never encountered serious theology in their lives; everything they know of religion is gleaned from what other atheists say or from caricature figures like Jim and Tammy Faye Baker. So the author keys off of quotes from lawyer Alan Dershowitz and random people who have sent him e-mail on the Internet.<br /><br />Theology is a difficult subject because people usually approach God by projecting themselves onto an immense scale. Thus, there is certainly much garbage out there (95% of it). And Pickover weaves as much of it together as he can, while leaving out the brilliant analysis of thinkers from Augustine to Aquinas that have shaped the modern world and given birth to science itself.<br /><br />If your time is valuable and you are seriously interested, better books include \\"The Nature and Character of God\\" (Pratney).  \\"See the Gods Fall\\" (Beckwith), \\"Warranted Christian Belief\\" (Plantinga), \\"Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview\\" (Moreland & Craig eds.)<br /><br />These may be harder to read than Pickover's (no cartoons); theology has technical words with precise meanings, as does physics and other fields of study. Careful thinking requires clarity in meaning, the preservation of subtle distinctions. One should expect to have to learn things to advance a well-developed discussion -- not amble into the physics department wagging your finger about how the \\"gravitational immutability of color demonstrates the paradox of orangeness surrounding depth of vibration\\".<br /><br />Here are some concepts relevant to understanding God as Christians do:<br /><br />Aseity -- self-existence. God is pure actuality with zero potential. He cannot be anything other than He is. All other beings have actuality and potential and are contingent. Humans endure a state of progressive actualization.<br /><br />Simplicity -- God is absolutely simple and indivisible. Simpler than a hydrogen atom. No \\"parts\\" or divisibility, yet a living being.<br /><br />Necessity -- God is a necessary being. Not being contingent, he has no potential for non-existence.<br /><br />Immutability -- unchangeability; change implies unactualized potential and is a tensed (time-dependent) concept.<br /><br />Eternal -- God exists outside of time and space. He is aware of the universe's past, present and future simultaneously and eternally. Eternity does not mean \\"endless time\\", but the absence of time. God is aware of all places and times at once and directly, without intermediary agents. From God's point of view, the universe was never created, it is eternal. It is created only as seen from the point of view of beings in time. Time is the progressive actualization of things with potentiality.<br /><br />The universe is neither small nor large to God; these are intrinsically spatial terms relevant only to creatures in space. Carl Sagan's observation that there must be alien life otherwise the \\"universe would be a waste of space\\" imposes human perceptions on God. 12 billion light years or the nucleus of an atom -- neither large nor small to God because he is not similarly dimensioned. One of the most common problems in the book is to phrase the discussion using words that have subtle spatial and tensed meanings -- the paradox is drawn by mixing concepts improperly.<br /><br />Relatability -- God, as eternal and unchanging, is not dependent on anything. Everything else is defined relative to Him. When the Bible speaks of God's \\"anger\\" being kindled, it is a clarifying anthropomorphism describing the result of people changing relative to God. Biblical Hebrew had 3000 words to choose from to communicate subtle concepts across thousands of years. It does so very well to the careful reader, but moderns prefer not to understand.<br /><br />When you strike a match, the match moves while something else doesn't. Similarly, people change their position/potential with respect to God who doesn't change. Sort of like holding a glass upside down under a waterfall, saying it is empty, then turning it up and, as it fills, claiming turning the glass over \\"turned on\\" the waterfall. The waterfall is the same, your position has changed relative to it. So it goes with God's seeming \\"changes\\".<br /><br />The history, basis, reasoning and analysis of these issues is fascinating. Those interested in \\"Paradoxes of God\\" might want to look into the real deal. Theological students at conservative seminaries might enjoy this book for the light-recreation of picking it apart in late night bull sessions. Of course liberal seminaries would adopt it as a text.<br /><br />An apparent paradox is one way of saying you don't understand the subject.  Science has learned this over and over. Hopefully the author's \\"science of omniscience\\" will too.	2002-11-15

The fragility of their Christian civilization and culture was exposed as it repeatedly hung by a thread in the face of great brutality. This inspired agonized examinations of why God would allow such things to be done to his people.<br /><br />Yet with a dogged and determined faith, the end result was the uniting of England and the conversion of the Viking conquerors to Christianity, along with all of Scandinavia. Barely remembered acts of courage and faith (and no few unremembered ones) made England (thus the world) what it is.<br /><br />How a savage and materialistic people such as the Vikings came to be monks, missionaries and church builders when exposed to the Christians they conquered is the subject of this book.<br /><br />The volume differs from others (or at least the 2 I have read) on the Viking period in that it focuses on how the two peoples understood the world. It is this understanding that shapes historical events. Thus, one learns more about those years in the first 30 pages of this book than in all of Gwyn Jones classic \\"A History of the Vikings\\".<br /><br />For example, where Jones might describe Viking family histories with \\"... the superstructure is often shaped by arbitrary assumptions on the nature of history itself\\" (very illuminating, no?), Cavill instead focuses on the role of ideas: how people understood what was happening to them and their nation in a context defined by their Christian faith.<br /><br />Perhaps the majority of modern historians, being secular, lack the inclinationto pursue this line of study, or more probably the discernment to see it as important, but faith appears in sermons of the time, the lives of saints, in seemingly secular accounts of battles, in the prose of chronicles and in other sources shaped by a Christianity deeply shocked by the Viking violation. Virtually every expression from that time revolves around fear of the Vikings and its intersection with Christian faith. To instead focus on descriptions of grave contents or speculate about variations in layout of Viking villages is to drain history of what's important.<br /><br />Thus, I was excited to read this volume by about page 4 of the introduction, as I think others will be, in that it illuminates what happened to the Vikings. It seems to me such knowledge is relevant to the present.<br /><br />Let the lament of monks evacuating to Ireland as the world crumbled around them, only to have their hand-made gospel book washed overboard in a raging storm, speak across the centuries:<br /><br />'What shall we do?', they said. 'Where shall we go carrying the relics of the father? For seven years we have travelled across the entire province fleeing from the barbarians, and there is no place of refuge left in the entire country ... In addition to all this we are weighed down by a cruel hunger which forces us to seek relief for our lives, but the sword of the Danes ravaging everywhere will not allow us to travel with this treasure. But if we abandon it, and look after ourselves, what shall we answer Cuthbert's people when they afterward ask us where their pastor and patron is?'<br /><br />\\"Vikings: Fear and Faith\\" looks at a large number of literary sources, recognizing even possible exagerrations (ship counts, etc.) can provide information as to what people were thinking.  It considers King Alfred and King Canut as well as other people and institutions. The book has 100 pages of appendices containing original texts translated by the author:<br /><br />1.

US	53075343	R1CE5NZOP77J6Q	0830727981	400177931	Pagans in the Pews	Books	5	22	33	N	N	Thoughtful description of what church tolerance leads to.	This is a worthwhile look at the false spirtuality currently hollowing out most churches. The appearance of Christianity is retained in the corrupted churches for a time, as a bait and switch proceeds.<br /><br />As an example, I visited a Methodist church to find the sermon delivered by two lesbian co-pastors. The content had nothing to do with Christianity but was more of a pep-talk with the congregation reciting self-esteem liturgies seemingly from some pop-psychology book or 12-step program. The word \\"I\\" was very prominent and there was much about manipulating oneself to achieve the right feelings. A creepy experience and a relief to get out of there, but this was introduced to the church bit by bit over many years; pressure from all directions to be tolerant and become more relevant to peoples lives, coupled with a \\"new type of bible study\\" here, a set of \\"dynamic, innovative\\" outside speakers there, etc. Such urgings flow from false premises.<br /><br />The book spells out the philosophical and historical relationship between this self-worship, Christian liberalism (a misinterpretation originating in poor theology of the 1500's), relativism, goddess worship, Gnosticism, witchcraft and sexual deviancy.<br /><br />Few people are in awe of God (for reasons elaborated in the Bible; pride), but they remain aware of some divine presence in their lives by whose power they stand or fall. They despise His judgement but don't want to provoke Him with too much contempt. So they turn away from God and look within to worship the product of their own vanity and imagination. They convince themselves the notions and compulsions that bubble up within them are god -- and what should be worshipped.<br /><br />Obviously none of the previous negative reviewers read the book. If something is filled with hate, it is easy to show that without the name calling of children. This book is actually filled with extensive quotations of the modern spiritualists so you can observe their thinking in their own words.<br /><br />The weakness of the book may be that it is largely descriptive; what this ersatz spirituality is, it's history, and the people involved. There is not much analysis or comparison. The author indicates that will be for a future book. Thus, some may find the current volume unsatisfying for not laying out a solution or rigorously analyzing the underpinnings of the new age worldview, but it remains a good description. The writing style occassionally distracts with some hyperbole and the author could do with fewer single word quotes -- a \\"bad\\" (!) habit. These things are not severe enough here for Christians to skip the book.<br /><br />A \\"Pagans in the PULPITS\\" volume  might be better since, as the book itself points out, pagans should be in the pews: cringing as light is shined on dark corners. The problem occurs when the pagans are the ones in the pulpits and running the seminaries as is currently the case.  Many modern seminaries are platforms by which gay rights and feminist activists can have moral authority conferred upon them. Despite the endless pride parades (a giveaway), they know they are out of accord with reality and God and are positively driven to seek moral authority. The result is more far-reaching than the actually desirable state of having \\"pagans in the pews\\". A expose of what is happening in seminaries and church leadership would be even more powerful.<br /><br />The great secular states of the 20th century which have freed themselves from Christianity (Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot) have killed 200 million and enslaved billions in their quest to create an \\"enlightened\\" state. The new spirituality cannot help but travel the same path as the others because it works on the same assumptions. Recall Nazi Germany was essentially an attempt to revive the pre-Christian pagan Woten cult, with the hatred of the intellectual class directed towards those \\"responsible\\" for the monotheism that displaced paganism -- the Jews.<br /><br />Christianity provides the basis for equality before the law, appreciation of science and education, the rule of law, \\"ending\\" slavery, the confinment of superstitions and softening of routine brutal practices common in pagan societies prior to Christianity, the provision of a moral basis to political structures. It offers the only true rationale for human rights and dignity. If you are the result of random, unobserved chemical accidents, there is no basis for claiming you have rights. The concept comes from the Christian understanding of humans as being made in the spiritual image of God.<br />Unfortunately, this is a great time to be a biblical Christian. There's much work to do.	2002-07-01

One of the stones around the neck of Darwinist evolutionary theory is that it hasn't been observed to happen.Thousands of years of intensive breeding of dogs (not even the undirected evolution Darwin described) hasn't produced a new species of non-dogs. Same with cats and other living things.  The way around the problem is to avoid defining what evolution is or broaden it to simply mean &#34;change&#34; so that anything that changes is said to evolve. Defined that way, evolution can be trumpeted every time a rock rolls down the hill.  It's sort of like AIDS in Africa. First you had to be tested and found to have HIV to be counted as an AIDS case. Well, it was hard to test, so instead AIDS was redefined to be a class of symptoms. If you had the symptoms, you were counted. Immediately after the redefinition of AIDS, the reports started about an explosion of AIDS in Africa.Now whenever the stats need to be cranked up, a commission meets to add new symptoms to the list and expand the pool of what can be called AIDS.  These are also the author's primary methods, used in the hope no one looks too closely at all the semantic shell games being played. At times evolution is used in a context which implies &#34;change&#34;. Then there is a shift and the idea is blended without warning to mean speciation (Darwinism). Word meanings flip back and forth without distinction so credibility can clandestinely be transferred from what everyone knows to be true (genetic variation) to that which is unproven (Darwinian speciation).  The organisms that develop resistance to antibiotics are the same type of bacteria as before they developed resistance. They have not become a different kind of bacteria. Exposure to the solvent DMSO has made resistant bacteria again susceptible to the old antibiotics. The reason isn't certain, but it appears as if it might have something to do with an external coating rather than genetic coding. Inheriting a useful slime coat from a pool of bacteria (that reproduce by splitting) is now being trumpeted as evolution without evidence, just like AIDS is exploding in Africa without testing. An artifact of definition.  It's like how one might persistently catch colds until beginning  to take vitamin C supplements. If I no longer catch colds, have I biologically evolved?  The author would have you think so.  The actual criticism of Darwinism is directed at the claim new information (new species) can be developed by undirected natural selection. It just has not been observed to happen.  Now if you want to falsely represent the critics of Darwinism, you can define evolution to simply mean &#34;change&#34;. Then every time there is change in a biological system -- bingo -- you can say it &#34;evolved&#34;. And critics of Darwinism then can be made to appear foolish and ignorant by ignoring all the &#34;evidence of evolution (change)&#34; exploding around them. Deeply dishonest. Lousy thinking, lousy science.  Everyone is aware of genetic variation. Blonde and black-haired spouses may have brown-haired children; tall and short may produce children in-between, etc., etc. This is the biological equivalent of painting-between-the-lines; radically different from the production of new species and the origin of life.  The subject of antibiotic resistance is a serious and interesting one, but using it falsely to wrap around evolution as a disguising cover is disingenous; an act of propaganda, not science.  It is completely true that accepting genetic variation but not speciation is a failure of imagination. Imagination is simply not enough to do the job.  Speciation by natural selection is claimed to be a science, yet  hasn't been observed,isn't repeatable and can't predict results. It's not science, but a philosophy of rationalization; it allows little stories to be constructed to explain why things are without regard to reality.  Darwinist start with the question &#34;How do I want the universe to be?&#34; and then determine truth tofit the answer. Actual science reverses the questions: &#34;What is truth?&#34; THEN &#34;How shall we live?&#34;	2002-06-25

Buckley, Jr. : On Science, Literature, and Religion	Books	1	15	40	N	Y	Library loaner or used paperback only (if you can't skip).	The first third of the book contains articles & biographies relating to children and science-fiction book authors, along with 3 chapters on the history of a religious group/cult (7th Day Adventist).<br /><br />The first chapter (\\"Wandering Jew\\") was promising, once one makes peace with it being  a history of the consequences of poor scholarship without actually correcting the scholarship. However, it was spoiled in the end by vitriol.<br /><br />The last two-thirds contain book reviews; two chapters on the Wizard of Oz (more than most would care to know), the \\"Christian Science\\" cult, a look at social constructivist claims about mathematics, etc.<br /><br />The book tends to undermine itself; gratuitous phrases like \\"moronic\\" and \\"tin brains\\" suddenly pop up. It seems like the author just can't get over the existence of human fallibility: the compulsion to instruct people on proper right-thinking seems irrepressible.<br /><br />The common thread is that the attacks are directed only at people who challenge human-based authority. The modus operandi is to seek deviant examples for caricature and hope it carries over as a generalization in the reader's mind. Thus the extensive coverage of Jim and Tammy Faye Baker, bizarre religious cults, and so on. The innocent reader would never guess brilliant modern religious thinkers and writers like Alvin Plantinga, William Lane Craig, Norman Geisler, Gary Habermas or Kelly James Clarke exist -- not even a whisper about their work. Someone might find out thoughtful and powerful answers exist to humanist charges.  Analysis of Augustine or Aquinas or Calvin?  No. Any serious knowledge of church history? No.  Just a spotlight for the deviant.<br /><br />For all the overt and covert attacks on religion, the book seems mostly informed on the subject by \\"60 minutes\\" or \\"20/20\\" segments and the garish cast of characters who show up there. The goal seems to be how long a sneer can be sustained.<br /><br />There seems dissatisfaction thatindividuals cannot be prevented from wrestling with issues of God and existence. However, the topic can't be controlled like mathematics: restricted to an elite 1 out of a 100000. People with of all sorts of intellects and cognitive skills and sinful natures are drawn to these issues. I would think a person who claims an intellectual life would seek out the best thought, not dwell on the weakest. One can't help but think of the junior high-school student who likes to pick on the 3rd graders. Trying someone at his own level or higher means the risk of getting creamed.<br /><br />There are dozens of thoughtful, brilliant volumes one could profitably spend time with. Why the author avoids them is an open question:<br /><br />\\"6 Modern Myths About Christianity and Western Civilization\\" (Sampson). \\"Christianity on Trial: Arguments Against Anti-Religious Bigotry\\" (Carroll),\\"Inventing the Flat Earth\\" (Russell), \\"How Now Shall We Live\\" (Colson), \\"Church History in Plain Language\\" (Shelley), \\"Atheism and the Erosion of Freedom\\" (Morey), \\"Reasonable Faith\\" (Craig), \\"Christian Apologetics\\" (Geisler),\\"New Evidence That Demands a Verdict\\" (McDowell).<br /><br />With all that is happening in the world, \\"The Wandering Jew\\" could leave one thinking the biggest problem out there is that someone somewhere might be taking an herb not approved by the FDA/AMA and \\"who-knows-what-might-happen-if-he-thinks-it-works?\\". Trivial stuff and a waste of the author's (and reader's) time.	2002-01-18

This is a fine book that exposes the distortions, half-truths and lies laid at the feet of Christianity. As the author points out, people who may never have cracked a history book are pretty sure Christianity is responsible for racism, sexism, war and most of the troubles of the world.<br /><br />These assertions have been aggressively promoted by many of the intellectual elite (media, educators), eventually filtering outward for decades. Such people have an agenda and recognize that to overturn society in favor of one based on their own personal desires and beliefs, the past must be demonized. Thus Christians are routinely villified in editorial pages and newscasts using terms that end careers if applied to blacks or women or homosexuals.<br /><br />The book answers such charges, showing where they come from and why they are historically unsupportable.<br /><br />It then goes on to show how Christianity provided the basis for equality before the law, appreciation of science and education, the rule of law, \\"ending\\" slavery, the confinment of superstitions and softening of brutal practices common prior to Christianity, the provision of a moral basis to political structures, and offers the only true rationale for human rights and dignity (humans being made in the spiritual image of God, as opposed to being a random, unobserved chemical accident).<br /><br />The people so angry about Christianity actually apply standards of right and wrong that emanate from its teaching (compassion, charity, forgiveness) -- they just don't know it.  A good remedy is historical knowledge. It's important because so many think they have evolved beyond the \\"confines\\" or Christianity, when in fact they have devolved backward, recovering the pagan concepts accepted prior to Christian enlightenment.<br /><br />If this books interests you, also look see \\"6 Modern Myths About Christianty and Western Civilization\\" (Sampson) which addresses additional topics, and \\"Inventing the Flat Earth\\" (Russell).	2002-01-16

I greatly looked forward to this book but couldn't have been more disappointed. The author correctly identifies Utopianism, the belief we live in a perfectable world, as the dominant source of mischief and tragedy throughout history.<br /><br />Utopian zeal shapes nations, political parties, education, law and people's lives, on a moment to moment basis. From Darwin to Marx to Freud to Stalin to Hitler to the 60's culture to modern hate groups, socialists and activists. All these things share the belief humans can \\"progress\\" to a perfect world.<br /><br />The book's failure is in identifying Christianity as Utopian when it has actually been the primary force opposing Utopian impulses throughout history. I don't know where the author could have gotten his understanding of Christianity (or history), but \\"The Kingdom of God\\" he describes Christians as referring to is something to be established by God, not people.<br /><br />Because of the existence of sin (specifically, Original Sin), Christians recognize no human action can possibly create Utopia. We do not live in a perfectable world. Christians see human thought as being so corrupted by sin, people cannot even IMAGINE a perfect world. All attempts will lead to ruin. Further, Christians view the Utopian impulse of humanity as evidence of and reflecting the desire of a fallen mankind to return to fellowship with God in the Garden of Eden -- something no human action can bring about, only the Grace of God.<br /><br />Thus, Christians, and those operating under Christian thinking, have been the historical force OPPOSING Utopianism.  The author's scholarship and understanding is so wrong, he misidentifies the only historical solution to the problem he is talking about.<br /><br />[The Puritan intent to set up an example of a shining \\"city on the hill\\" wasn't Utopian -- no group was more conscious on a moment-to-moment basis of the unavoidability of sin than Puritans -- but rather a demonstration of what could be done when adhering to God's given laws for a fallen, corrupt people]<br /><br />Recently, Utopian idealism, the denial of human sin, has been reformulated on the assertion humans are only mechanically derived animals; complicated bits of matter to be manipulated to a higher state by an elite which believes it has higher vision (replacing God with their own desires).<br /><br />Modernity is Utopianism, made scientifically plausible by Darwin whose Victorian-era studies seemed to eliminate God, thus Original Sin. The result was predicted and predictable (by Christians): Karl Marx quickly folded Darwin's science into communism and the attempt to perfect human nature scientifically, to create a Worker's Paradise (60 million killed in Russia, 50 million killed in China). Then the Nazi's (National Socialists) trying to create an Aryan super-race, also based on the science of Darwin (20 million dead & Holocaust). And eugenics and abortion: the modern world.<br /><br />Utopianism, rationalized as science, has killed 200+ million and enslaved billions in the great secular socialist states we live in.  This is why Christians advocate decentralization of power; to avoid its concentration in the hands of corrupt humans. And why the Utopians seek to centralize it, so the elite can shepherd us to Utopia. The modern Left are INTERNATIONAL Utopians while the Right are NATIONALISTIC Utopians (my country, my race). Same thought process, different implementation. Christians oppose them both; WW II, Cold War, etc.<br /><br />The author barely discusses socialism and Marxism while attacking Christianity. For this reason, the author's error makes the book perverse. Wrong history, wrong analysis, wrong conclusions.

This book examines U.S. immigration, documenting what's happening as 10's of millions of people (largely from the 3rd world) are allowed into the U.S.<br /><br />It's difficult to find accurate accounts of the immigration situation. Business lobbies for immigration to obtain cheap labor and keep wages down. Left-leaning intellectuals advocate immigration because of a hatred of the Western Civilization and desire to see it eliminated via diversity and multiculturalism. Politicians advocate immigration because they want to import dependent populations that need services and will vote for them (kings need peasants). Conservatives accept immigration because it seems to validate the desirability of American society and free-enterprise and they are afraid of being called names by the others.<br /><br />The result is a population growth curve for the U.S. like that of 3rd world nations, with corresponding social strains. If continued at the same rate, the U.S. will reach 400 million people by the year 2050 at huge social, economic and environmental costs. The President of Mexico campaigns here in California even as Mexicans talk about retaking the southeastern U.S. states \\"stolen\\" from them centuries ago by repopulating it and effectively eliminating the border; the effort is called the \\"Reconquista\\".  Don't expect in-depth coverage of this by ABC or the New York Times.<br /><br />The U.S. was created and maintained by the sacrifice, lives, hopes held by millions of ancestors many of whom paid the ultimate price to create the future: our present. The current generation now has the option of piddling that all away with a whimper or educating themselves and stopping destructive forces. This will mean enduring and refuting charges of racism, among the other antics of the cultural elite, without being deflected.<br /><br />This book a good starting place. It provides specifics on how high immigration damages the U.S. at multiple levels. The first to feel the effect of immigration are native blacks whose attempts to integrate into American mainstream have been substantially halted by preferences for immigrants. But all are affected.<br /><br />As an example, why do engineers developing the air traffic control system -- involving billions of dollars and millions of lives -- make one-half to one-tenth the salary of a routine lawyer or doctor? Employers can go to Congress and say \\"Americans aren't interested and not smart enough. Our schools can't produce engineers, we need to hire foreigners\\".<br /><br />This is not an option for professions like law, being dependent on language and cultural skills. So salaries for engineers are comparatively low and a shortage results despite the critical need. At the same time, law and medical schools are overflowing with people attracted by the high earning potential. The results of the immigration policy create the imbalance in the first place. Need more engineers? Pay more to attract them.<br /><br />It is like nothing has been learned. Slavery developed in this country to provide cheap labor. Yet the cotton pulled from the fields by slaves has long since rotted away to nothing. The consequences have not: civil war and ongoing social struggles spanning centuries. Much of the original intent and structure of the nation has been distorted or dissipated attempting to solve self-made, predictable problems. One can only wonder at what this country could have done if it had not wasted such massive resources in contortions over unimportant social issues.<br /><br />Now the concern is over a matter even more trivial, if that is possible: whether strawberries will be $1.20 a carton or $4.50 a carton in the 2-3 days before they rot away. Perhaps someone should sit down and design a decent strawberry picking machine and save future generations untold grief. It's called menial labor because no human should be doing it.<br /><br />The U.S. is not a strip mall with jingling cash registers the national anthem. It isbased on a set of specific ideas about human nature: that people are spiritually created in the image of God, thus have instrinsic worth and dignity. That humans are corrupted by sin, something that is real, thus power must be decentralized to avoid concentration in the hands of a single individual. These ideas are what distinguish the U.S. from the others (and a major reason the concept of human rights tends not to \\"catch on\\" in cultures lacking Christian background.)<br /><br />People are not like refrigerators or cars. When you import them, you also import their hopes, dreams and understandings for generations to come. We are now importing people who do not share the understanding of human nature this country is based on. They are rather from 3rd world countries which view people as disposable, government simply a source of power to control the people. When immigrants arrive here, they are now greeted by intellectuals and educators and media who share the same view. Why would newcomers perpetuate a society and institutions they have no way of understanding and are outside their tradition? Because they can make $7.50 an hour instead of $1.00?<br /><br />Columnist P. Roberts write, \\"The basis for a successful political life is a common language, history and culture, which create a people sufficiently cohesive for self-rule to arrive at compromises that solve conflicts. When \\"multicultural diversity\\" replaces \\"a people\\", cohesion must be provided by coercion.\\"<br /><br />The U.S. (and Europe) are on a self-destructive path that has been walked over and over throughout history. Only the rationalizations for inaction are more clever. Educate yourself with the facts, steel yourself for the vicious onslaught you will provoke, and speak up.	2002-01-01

In the last 10 years, a population greater than the nation of France has been allowed to enter and remain in the U.S., preferentially from 3rd world countries. Currently, over 30 million people in the U.S. are foreign-born.<br /><br />Discussion of the matter, to the extent allowed, usually revolves around rationalizations constructed by those with business interests (cheap labor, keep wages down), social interests (hatred of Western civilization, thus desire to dissolve it in multiculturalism) or political interests (import dependent populations that need social services -- kings need peasants). Conservatives are flattered by the idea immigration proves the worth of free-enterprise systems, but are mostly afraid of being called racists, being so secularized themselves they are unable to identify the real issues involved.<br /><br />This book takes a soothing \\"just like what happened in the past\\" approach to suppress examination, comparing the present with assimilation of Italians, Jews, Irish, etc. If there's nothing new happening, there is nothing to learn. No need to investigate. Have a beer, watch TV. Just relax and enjoy it.<br /><br />Actually, many substantial issues distinguish the current 3rd world influx from previous immigration. A couple:<br /><br /> 1) The idea of the U.S. as a nation is based on a specific view of human nature -- the understanding of people as being spiritually created in the image of God, thus of intrinsic worth. The idea has profound implications and has historically provided the only successful basis of human liberty. It's absence is one reason the concept of human rights tends not to catch on in countries lacking Christian backgrounds.<br /><br /> 2) The U.S. has a governing system of checks and balances with decentralized power because the founders were distrustful of human authority. This derives from an understanding of the reality of sin; people are corrupt by nature. If given a choice, their thoughts bend towards sin. Thus power must be dispersed, not concentrated. Human action can't create Utopia.<br /><br />These understandings, along with others, were shared by the cultures of the immigrant groups discussed by the author as successfully assimilated (with the exception of blacks, whose assimilation is very arguable after hundreds of years and a civil war).<br /><br />Unlike refrigerators or video-games, when you import people, you import their beliefs, aspirations and dreams for all time. When the 3rd world is imported, you don't just get cheap labor, you get people who have a radically different idea of human nature, revolving around authority, power and force.<br /><br />With the leaders, educators and media of the West explicitly rejecting the values and history that created them, newcomers cannot recognize what historical forces and ideas resulted in the society they moved to. They instead operate with a view of the U.S. as something akin to a giant strip mall with jingling cash registers the national anthem.<br /><br />Why would they perpetuate a culture they don't know and don't correctly understand? Institutions will be gradually altered to reflect the laws of force operating in 3rd world countries and no one will be able to understand exactly what's going wrong. This process is well underway both here and in Europe (where de-Christianization is more advanced).<br /><br />This book is a selective and not-very-bright look at the most important crisis in America. A more widely-informed and substantive appraisal is in Beck's \\"The Case Against Immigration\\".

Most people today have fairly shallow personal philosophies; typically a hodge-podge of conflicting beliefs selected according to which best matches their preconceptions.<br /><br />Shaping and installing such thoughts in hundreds of millions of people has been developed as something of an art form by modern U.S. media. Select which stories are news, which are not, determine the 'angle', then repeat, year-after-year. A miseducated public lacking strong intellectual and moral foundation is largely helpless.<br /><br />30 years ago, who would have imagined Boy Scouts would be banned from schools that dispense condoms to children? Or that the nation would import from the 3rd world a nation the size of France in 10 years, setting up it's own eventual dissolution? And that criticizing such things is often considered a \\"hate crime\\".<br /><br />How were right and wrong inverted in less than a generation? Ask people what thought process they used to arrive at these beliefs and you basically get incoherent sound bytes accepted only because they mirror the elite. Before TV, few people were exposed to beliefs of intellectuals. Now they are guinea pigs in their livings rooms for TV news folks dedicated to creating a new reality.<br /><br />Modern leftism naturally has been the driver. It's opposition, Christian philosophy, considers people as spiritually designed in the image of God, then corrupted by their own free choice. Because of the existence of sin, Christians recognize human imagination and action is incapable of creating a perfect world -- Utopia -- with all of human history as evidence, if the secular still doesn't see it.<br /><br />(Most of what the Left calls \\"the Right\\" are actually just NATIONALISTIC utopians who think the perfect world can be achieved via 'my race' or 'my nation'. By contrast, the Left are INTERNATIONAL utopians. So Left and Right have the same thought processes and assumptions, just different implementations. Modern political philosophy reallyboils down to Christians as compared to \\"everyone else\\", with Christians incorrectly being lumped in with the Right, since they oppose the Left and seek things like decentralization of power to prevent concentration of it in a single person or state that is intrinsically corrupt. This seems like nationalism, but has different intent.)<br /><br />By contrast, the Left sees humans as mechanically derived chemical accidents; \\"sin\\" is an opinion, not reality. Anything wrong with the world is correctable if people could be educated to think \\"properly\\". Thus, the Left is naturally drawn to institutions concerned with shaping how other people think: education, entertainment, government, and of course the media.<br /><br />Their goal, once there, is to alter how others think. The assumption is this will result in a perfect world. People who don't share their ideas are evil because they argue against what the Left thinks will create Utopia. \\"Who could oppose this beautiful world I can imagine and not be evil?\\" is what they think, never examining their basic presuppositions about reality. Inevitably, the Left is composed of a multitude of factions, each operating off an internal imagining of what is needed to create a perfect world -- diversity, socialism, radical environmentalism, personally selectable genders, absolute sexual freedom, etc.<br /><br />So that's a little background on the Why's of the subject of bias as prelude to the book. If you can stomache any more on the topic of media bias after reading this book, I strongly recommend \\"The Gospel According to the New York Times : How the World's Most Powerful News Organization Shapes Your Mind and Values\\" by Proctor.<br /><br />CBS largely gets its take on the news from the New York Times; the NYT tells them what's important and what the angle is. This then gets reflected back and forth on TV. While TV news maybe shallow and reflexive in it's bias, the NYT engages in an organized attack on opposing world-views, seekingto replace them with its own. Both books together will provide a powerful indictment of the devastatingly negative effect of these self-appointed definers of what is important.	2001-12-19
US	53075343	R2FZKBKKVO60VF	0805423478	356500939	The Gospel According to the New York Times: How the World's Most Powerful News Organization Shapes Your Mind and Values	Books	5	12	15	N	Y	Are you a victim of Culture Creep? You bet.	This book should be studied by every high-school civics class. It's among the most useful and incisive studies of the print media's \\"idea\\" (or intellectual) content.<br /><br />This book is not so much about familiar \\"liberal bias\\" claims; rather, it shows what the New York Times does goes beyond simple bias, to a conscious, deliberate, planned attack on opposing world-views with the goal of substituting its own set of absolute values.<br /><br />A decision to engage in propaganda often arises from a strong set of beliefs or vested interests. Since the average person today has shallow or non-existent personal philosophies (generally developed by cobbling together beliefs based on what gratifies preconceptions one isn't even aware of), true-believers with convictions can often convince non-believers easily.<br /><br />But if you understand the propagandists presuppositions -- those things he assumes are true, often without even realizing it -- and can identify and understand links to other organizations and philosophies, you will be in a better position to recognize the pattern, evaluate which assumptions are in play, and thus the correctness of the message.<br /><br />This book can therefore serve as an excellent guide to fostering critical thinking when it comes to modern media, through its examination of the most powerful news organization in the world, the New York Times. Nearly all journalists determine what is important and 'the angle' from the NYT, thus extending it's influence to the smallest town or largest cable network.<br /><br />The author shows how the beliefs of a handful of people are able to shape perceptions of reality in hundreds of millions by implanting assumptions in the public via decisions of what types of stories are important, headlines, picture selection, subtly slanted writing and the placement of opinion-shaping stories cloaked as news reports. Sheer persistent repetition is able to completely change the thinking and values of a public lacking intellectual foundations.<br /><br />30 years ago, who could have even imagined the Boy Scouts would be banned from public schools that now dispense condoms? Or the country would be managing its own dissolution by allowing the importation of 3rd world populations exceeding the size of France in just 10 years? And that criticism of such things is called \\"controversial\\" (if not a \\"hate-crime\\"!) and can ruin people? Curious about how the complete inversion of right and wrong could be engineered within a single generation? Read this book.<br /><br />The author also looks at conflicts of interest, giving examples where organizations the New York TImes had a direct undisclosed financial interest in were at the center of its reporting and editorializing to its benefit; the link between the NYT and the Pulitzer Prize committee which returns so many awards to it; the many examples in which Culture Creep techniques were used to alter public morality by using \\"the opinion piece in disguise\\", \\"the editorial blast\\", \\"the op-ed hit piece\\", and \\"the bombardment\\".<br /><br />The author identifies the set of fundamentalist beliefs the New York Times promotes; \\"The Sin of Religious Certainty\\", \\"The Sin of Conservatism\\", \\"The Sin of Capital Punishment\\", \\"The Sin of Broken Public Trust\\", \\"The Second of the Second Amendment\\", the \\"Sin of Censorship\\", \\"The Sin of Limiting Abortion\\".<br /><br />The NYT also defines certain cultural spirits as being positive: globalism, multiculturalism, total sexual freedom, environmentalism, entitlement, scientism and humanism.<br /><br />The book analyzes coverage of stories ranging from the Columbine shooting to election coverage; both the coverage content, slanting, comparison of stories with the actual events, and statistical studies of the word usage and counts.<br /><br />The book is well-written. Afterward, one can hardly read the New York Times without laughing, assuming you took it seriously before.<br /><br />For example, two days ago I read in the NYT that public belief in the existence of absolute right and wrong, jumping to 38% after the Sep 11 attack, had now declined to \\"normal\\"; 22%. The message was \\"religion back to normal\\". Apparently, this was thought by the NYT a matter needing polling. Those religious leaders who had earlier remarked about the rebirth of religion in America could now be shown as wrong while simultaneously emphasizing how \\"religious certainty\\" was once again a declining minority. The effect of the attack, which reawakened patriotic sentiments and threatened the Times belief system, was now waning. Back to business as usual.<br /><br />Of course, if you read the polling question, results would actually have to be 100% of the public believe in absolutes. If you think there is no absolute right or wrong, that belief itself is a claim to an absolute truth; a claim to be right.<br /><br />But, two days later, USA Today picked up on the NYT priority, incoherent as it is, and ran it's own piece on the same subject, echoing the marching orders, as did countless other papers around the country and world. In this way, opinions are remolded in a specific direction without regard to reality.	2001-11-29
US	53075343	R1LPKID1EW6GOU	0275965775	455232612	The Revolt of the Primitive: An Inquiry into the Roots of Political Correctness	Books	2	25	36	N	Y	Freudian approach to feminist primitivism fails to take root	Two things I wish I had know about this book up front were that the pricing is genuinely inexplicable and that it is a Freudian psychoanalytic approach to analyzing the subject of feminism.<br /><br />Feminism is but one branch of modern \\"political correctness\\", a deceptively bland term that refers to a way of thinking which follows inevitably if one assumes humans are mechanically and accidentally derived automatons (as compared to Christianity, which recognizes humans as being spiritually designed in the image of God, thus of intrinsic worth despite choosing to sin).<br /><br />The actual roots of P.C. feminism are thus faith in the presupposition of naturalism, not the Freudian fictions the author claims. P.C. people see right and wrong as being defined only by human power; subordination to God is anathema, the idea offending their prideful natures. They prefer the instrinsically unprovable (and contradictory) assumption there are only undirected, natural things, disregarding the evidence of life and history, that God that created men and women with definite natures and roles.<br /><br />Because the book's approach is Freudian, it can't really get at the root it claims to. Interestingly, it often uses religious wordings like \\"sin\\" and \\"holy war\\", but strips the ideas of content, guaranteeing an inadequate analysis. Perhaps the author also starts by assuming naturalism is true.<br /><br />While descriptions of the feminization of the military and other concrete events is good, better understanding can be had in Veith's \\"Modern Fascism: Liquidating the Judeo-Christian Worldview\\", which traces the development of fascism over the centuries into modern institutions such as Political Correctness, feminism and post-modernism.<br /><br />Feminist thinking shares much with classical, pre-Christian paganism (thus the frequent links with witchcraft, goddess and nature worship), so the author's recognition of it as a form of primitivism is at least close to the mark. Feminists think about women using the same pattern of reasoning that fascists do with the nation-state. Men (or Jews) are toxic while women (The Motherland) are benevolent and loving, yet oppressed. Institutions (human power) must remade to halt oppression of women (i.e. different results). A utopian vision is built around what is imagined would happen if women (Aryan super-race) could properly run things, as they are obviously better suited to do. The actual result is a society dedicated to shaming boys for displaying any behavior that leads to different outcomes.<br /><br />For example, flip on one of the news networks and you will quickly see stories about, say, how women suffer from cervical cancer more than they need to because they are so busy taking care of others they have no time for their own health. That they suffer more from breast cancer than they need to because they don't want to appear vulnerable in their \\"male-dominated\\" workplace. That is, they suffer from one form of cancer BECAUSE they are so good; they suffer another form of cancer BECAUSE men are so bad.<br /><br />After permeating culture with such negative biases, one ends up with millions of young boys being medicated daily with Ritalin because they are boys and the deck becoming so stacked against them that male college attendance is dropping rapidly; 8.4 million women to 6.7 million men in 1996 and projected at 9.2/6.2 ratio by 2007.  Apparently, sitting quietly and passively in chairs is not just how women learn, but the universal method boys must accept too, even if they need to be drugged to do so.<br /><br />While I don't recommend it, the book's accounts of specific events is fascinating (but perhaps instead see \\"The Myth of Male Power\\"); to a large extent, the reshaping of institutions by feminists occurs behind the scenes since if people knew how bizzare the intentions, it would never fly.<br /><br />Reading the book did improve my focus on the white-collar phenomenon of women who are hired out of college and given high visibility jobs managing others more experienced, then rapidly promoted. Within a couple years, a local newspaper inevitably does the full page story revolving around the fact they are women a traditionally male field. Then invitations to the White House for ceremonies, and membership on a board that advises upper-level management on women's issues, functioning behind the scenes, almost like a self-reinforcing Trotskyite cell.  Meanwhile, the males are often left trying to figure out what the woman actually did to obtain such attention. Not a good situation. Elevation of women simply because they are women while denigrating and medicating men for being energetic, then discarding them to prisons if that fails will eventually erode away the foundations of civilized societies.	2001-11-24

Weeds will keep sprouting from roots.<br /><br />The reality of Islam needs to be examined ... from its origins in visions Muhammad first thought came from demons until his wife convinced them they came from God, to their integration with incompletely understood aspects of Christianity Muhammad picked up here and there, adapting them to Arab nomadic paganism to the extent his human understanding allowed (for example, Arab fathers tend to be distant and harsh, thus a Muhammad not inspired by God could make no sense of God as a loving father figure who cared about His creation. So that was excised along with related understandings like \\"forgiveness\\" -- mercy not being the same thing). Islamic denial of the innate sinfulness of mankind, the uniform tendency of man to separate from God, leads to a reward/punishment system based on simple human deeds.<br /><br />This book covers the history and theology of Islam at a fairly scholarly yet readable and accessible level. The first 130 pages describe the basic beliefs of orthodox Islam concerning God, creation, prophets, Muhammad, the Qu'ran and salvation. This is drawn mostly from Muslim sources like the Qu'ran, Muslim tradition (the Hadith), and Islamic commentators.<br /><br />The next 76 pages are a Christian analysis of those beliefs and various criticisms that have been suggested, with the goal of reaching conclusions on the level of support and validity of Islamic claims. A great deal of attention is paid to the factual basis for and internal consistency of the claims.<br /><br />This is followed by 80 pages of response to common Islamicdepictions of Christianity; the evidence for the Christian counter-claim. 24 pages of appendices provide supplementary material on Islam such as Muslim sects, religious practices, and Muslim use of modern biblical criticism methods.<br /><br />There is no pointless vitriol, just eyes-open examination. Another good book that adds a little more is \\"Islam Revealed\\" by Dr. Anis A. Shorrosh.<br /><br />It's not likely Christian leadership in the U.S., to the extent it exists, will soon drop its embrace of Islam as an equal. Modern seminaries and theological departments tend to produce secular humanists who want the moral authority to advance agendas regarding racism, gay rights and so on, along with the resulting approval of a secular culture, more than anything, so end up squeezing God out. They are hesitant to speak the truth because they don't think there is such a thing (incoherent, since the lack of truth would itself be a truth, thus is a contradiction); they don't want Islam exposed because they think they will be exposed. This is only their failure; Christianity will thrive with honest scrutiny. Islam cannot. This is one reason Christianity gave birth to liberal democracies while Islamic countries execute missionaries.<br /><br />Only conversion of Islam to Christianity will solve the problem we face, not eliminating terrorist networks. Of course, that means you first have to understand Christianity. One excellent aid here is \\"How Now Shall we Live\\" by C. Colson and \\"Nothing but the Truth\\" by B. Edwards	2001-11-22

Human understanding of Christian truth rests on the Bible. Unfortunately, the last century has seen a flood of translations by those who believe they have the gift of being better able to express what God intended than God.<br /><br />This has proven to be the mechanism by which groups of humans insert their interpretations of what they think the Bible should say. Thus thousands of words are added, dropped, changed, or deliberately mistranslated, causing problems and confusion not present in the original language.<br /><br />The corruption of Bible versions such as the NIV, NASB, RS, NKJV, etc., is analyzed in detail in the book \\"Unholy Hands on the Bible\\".<br /><br />The Literal Version translation's reason for existence is to NOT add or subtract meaning from the original language texts. Of course, Hebrew, a somewhat pictoral language, and Greek, are not 1:1 compatible with modern English; punctation, capitalization, and paragraphing not present in the original are all interpretive.<br /><br />Thus scholars often say that a literal translation would not make sense. While the Literal Version's exceptionally careful rendering into English sometimes results in awkward or grammatically fractured results, you will find the opposite is true; meaning often is more clear in the literal rendering than in the garbled, interpretative paraphrasings negotiated by self-selected committees of people more inspired by modern humanism or doctrinal agenda than anything else.<br /><br />You might end up preferring the Literal Version above all other translations.<br /><br />Note that the Literal Version DOES NOT include the original Hebrew and Greek. The same publisher has a separate Interlinear Bible which DOES contain the original Hebrew and Greek, a word-for-word translation underneath, Strong's numbers above (so you can look up the word in a concordance or lexicon and follow the translator's decsiions) with the Literal Translation on the side.

The author makes the point that once a person dies, their teeth may last thousands of years. Yet, while alive and part of an nutritional/immune system, most people are hard-pressed to keep them from rotting out of their mouth within a few years -- and think this is normal.<br /><br />He lays out the chronology of most people's progressive dental deterioration; the first fillings at 8-12, progressing to crowns in 20's-30's, root canals and bridges in 30's-50's with subsequent extraction and dentures in old age. There is nothing left, after having marched arm-in-arm with the state-of-the-art dental care ... and thinking this is normal, despite folks in other parts of the world living life with a set of choppers the likes of which most dentists never even see.<br /><br />The author lays out the realities and falsehoods behind each common dental procedure, as well as a dental care profession that has managed to isolate itself from the rest of medicine. This permits denial that the procedures and materials used in dentistry usually result in chronic infections and toxicity that have far-ranging, degenerative health consequences all over the body.<br /><br />The latest thing is radioactive composite fillings \\"that show up better on x-rays\\". Banned from glowing wrist-watches, but OK for implantation in your mouth (the levels are \\"safe\\").<br /><br />The good news is you don't have to wait the generation or two it will take for the policy-making ADA dental leadership (whose egos and prestige are at risk if the last century of treatment methods are recognized as being erroneous and harmful) to die off and reform to set in.<br /><br />Tooth and gum rot can be arrested and dental health improved by changes in behavior and diet.

Yet, considering what's going on with cancer, dentistry, AIDS, in which politics, ego and perpetuating institutions are more important than solutions, perhaps this time will be looked upon even less favorably than when \\"leeching\\" was common.

Buy this beautifully researched, insightful book.<br /><br />The author looks at 6 primary beliefs that define the modern world, tracing their development as fictions cultivated by 18-20th century Enlightenment humanists who distorted their opponents beliefs and history, even fabricating quote attributions in the process. The goal was to replace Christian  understanding of God, reality and man with naturalist beliefs, derived from Greek paganism, thus move authority from God to man (specifically, them).<br /><br />Because of the author's gentle style, some readers new to the debate over humanism vs. religion & science may find it valuable to first read \\"Atheism and the Erosion of Freedom\\" (Morey), to understand the underlying assumptions driving the Humanist project.<br /><br />\\"Inventing the Flat Earth\\" (Russell) is another outstanding book that focuses on a single issue: the fabrication of the idea (in the 1820's) that medieval people thought the world flat, so as to discredit the church and construct a Dark Age to be be corrected by Enlightened moderns.<br /><br />Included in \\"6 Myths\\":<br /><br />#1) Remember plucky Galileo, who stood against the might of the church armed only with the flame of reason and a telescope? Tortured by the Inquisition and condemned as a heretic for showing humans lived on an insignificant speck orbiting a common star nowhere special in the Universe, a realization that  devastated a now-undermined church?  Well, nothing in the above humanist story is true.<br /><br />Copernicus proposed the Earth revolved around the Sun decades before Galileo. It was widely discusssed, but evidence was lacking. The Roman Catholic Church provisionally accepted the view of Aristotle, that everything revolved around the Earth, pending other information. Geocentrism was a Greek idea, not a Biblical one.<br /><br />While people debated heliocentrism, a matter of no significance in the Bible, (the main opponents of heliocentrism were other astronomers with pride vested in understanding of concentric spheres, NOT clergy), Galileo got in trouble for implying the Pope, who had gone out of his way to befriend Galileo, (even penning an ode to him in 1620), was a simpleton. Further, Galileo asserted that the Bible was written for the common man and did not need a church to interpret.  This was strikingly similar to arguments of the earlier John Calvin and the Protestant Reformation, to which the Roman Catholic Church WAS acutely sensitive, contributing to Galileo's arrest.<br /><br />The choicest morsel here is one that always baffled me: the notion that heliocentrism somehow devastated the church by removing Man from the center of creation. This shows total ignorance of Biblical Christianity which ACTUALLY says all things were made NOT for humans, but for the Son of God.  Their value arises from God's delight in them.<br /><br />When the Enlightenment lapsed back into Greek idiom, it confused mankind being given \\"dominion\\" (leadership responsibility) with the Greek understanding: \\"domination\\". The idea that nature's reason for existence is its usefulness to mankind is a Greek one, coming from Aristotle, not the Bible.  It was extended by the Romans, who treated the natural environment as a conquered province.  At times the confusion did seep into the church, via  writings influenced by Hellenism, such as Aquinas, but was expelled during the Reformation.<br /><br />At the time of Galileo, the Earth being at the center of the universe was NOT AN HONOR. It was the outer celestial spheres that were pure and divine. The Universe became more corrupt as you moved to the center, which is why Dante put Hell in the center of the Earth.  The Earth was held to be corrupt due to  mankind's Fall and sinful nature.<br /><br />When Galileo asserted the Earth was ACTUALLY a heavenly body, far from demoting it, he elevated it (and mankind) in importance. And he wrote so. Which is what endeared him to the humanistic (ego/pride-centered) \\"Enlightenment\\" intellects.<br /><br />Chapter #2) Darwin: completed the Copernican revolution for humanists, by seeming to remove God and Original Sin.  Materialistic, undirected evolution meant human thought, ego/pride and power were the actual pivots around which the universe revolved, not God. The book documents an array of historical fabrications used to caricature the church's position on evolution. Humanists need to reinforce their view of themselves as rational and tolerant (because they are not), needing an enemy to attack so as to avoid self-examination (see my review of \\"Why People Believe Weird Things\\"(Shermer)). This is one reason there seem to be countless books railing against the danger of believing in pseudo-science like dowsing, but one is hard pressed to find anything pro-dowsing.  Shadow-boxing?).<br /><br />#3) The Environment. Shows how, contrary to the humanist myth that Bible-based human \\"dominion\\" caused environmental degradation, it is actually Greek and Roman thought, revived by the Enlightenment project (while suppressing Christianity through caricature and demonization), that gives the go ahead. To a Christian, a tree is part of Creation, designed by God.  The Puritans were strong, original environmentalists, opposing animal cruelty even as their detractors lied to cartoon their motives as the opposite. It is in Christian societies where modern environmental awareness was founded and developed.<br /><br />#4) The Missionaries -- shows how terms like \\"savage\\" and \\"barbarian\\" and \\"civilization\\" are foreign to Biblical understanding, but are prominent in \\"Enlightened\\" thought. Actual Christianity sees all humans as being made in the image of God thus having intrinsic worth. Accordingly, it is in Christian societies where slavery was legally banned and the idea of \\"human rights\\" has root.<br /><br />#5) Human body -- punctures the idea the Christianity means sexual repression, and shows why humanists needed to invent the caricature.<br /><br />#6) Witchcraft --  documents the real history, grossly exagerrated by humanists. 20 people died in Salem. But hundreds of millions have been killed and enslaved this century trying to create secular Utopias, be they communist, socialist, or fascist.<br /><br />This skeletal summary doesn't do the book justice.

The author points out Christianity has faced prior challenges from a hostile culture. The first after the fall of Rome, when pagans sought to blame social problems on Christians, the second from a rising Islam.<br /><br />The challenges stimulated Augustine (413 A.D) and Aquinas (1260 A.D.) respectively, whose responses took the written form of \\"The City of God\\" and \\"Summa Contra Gentiles\\", two key works in the history of Western civilization.<br /><br />The author compares the two responses and concludes they share methods that allowed successful disarming of the threats: \\"entering the challenger's story\\", \\"retelling it\\", and \\"capturing\\" it in the broader logic of Christianity.<br /><br />This is the natural thing to do: understand the challenger's position better than they do, show how it doesn't answer the questions they think it does, then demonstrate your position encompasses theirs.

The author, based in academia, asserts post-modern denial of human ability to determine truth is the dominant threat; that utopianism suffered a shattering blow in WWI and WWII and is dead.<br /><br />A stronger case can be made post-modernism is a minor linguistic procedure; take the leading post-modern theorist from the ivory tower, put him on a dude-ranch, away from TV, baling hay for a few months and post-modern pretensions vaporize.<br /><br />One can't function in the world while taking seriously the idea there are only myths people fabricate to avoid cognitive dissonance, or dominate others. That truth is not knowable.  It is simple to see through post-modern gamesmanship, once language methods they use are understood.  Post-modernism seems credible because it is poorly explained. And the other academics confronting it are also verbalists.<br /><br />The college student, leaning against a pillar, vexing the author by asking \\"How can you know anything is true?\\" will, even if no one is there to answer, one day graduate and get a job. 5-10 years later, the campus nonsense will be a dim memory, lost in real-world experience.  Time will have been wasted and a life diverted from greater richness, but it needn't be terminal.<br /><br />By contrast, utopian idealism, the denial of human sin, has been reformulated on the assertion humans are only mechanically derived animals; complicated bits of matter to be manipulated to a higher state by an elite which believes it has higher vision (replacing God with their own desires).<br /><br />This idealism has spread far from academia. It shapes nations, political parties, education, law and people's lives, on a moment to moment basis. From Darwin to Marx to Freud to Stalin to Hitler to the 60's culture to modern hate groups, socialists and activists; all linked by the belief humans can \\"progress\\" to a perfect world they imagine. Christians understand a fallen humanity cannot.  Utopianism IS a virulent threat, corroding the culture as a now invisible assumption.<br /><br />So one must keep the book's title in mind; it's about engaging \\"unbelief\\", not disbelief. But the author dismisses disbelief, the greater threat, too readily. Unbelievers go quietly into the night, like a forest of deadwood clearing itself. Disbelievers do not.<br /><br />Another concern is an author too far gone \\"entering the challenger's story\\". He seems to accept the premises of post-modernism; that life is about myth-making and story-telling, seemingly conceding the concept of truth.  He urges incorporating the opposition's beliefs, which he apparently has done.<br /><br />If the author saw in Augustine the idea of taking captive opponents' ideas, a clearer picture of how the Church in Rome became the Roman Catholic church snaps into view; the praying to Mary more than God (goddess worship), rituals involving physical objects (rosaries, statues), papal (human)infallibility, icons such as paintings of Jesus and other human-built objects of veneration.<br /><br />Protestants have historically seen this as idol worship of false images, contrary to biblical law, but similar to pagan customs.  It seems one can enter the opponent's story a bit too much.  There is the impression Augustine's battle with Roman pagans was not conclusive, trading away some of God's laws for the church, so as to cease hostilities. Is this why we have thousands flocking to offer prayers to a tortilla whose shadows look like Mary?<br /><br />In the end, the author suggests addressing the post-modern era in its own language: film-making. Protestants would say this a call to create false images of worship; idolatry. That there is a good reason there are no physical descriptions of Jesus. That Christianity needs spiritual doctors, not herding people into dark isolation rooms to see human contrived, out-of-context images flashed before them for emotional manipulation.<br /><br />The author says the post-modern Augustine or Aquinas probably won't be one of the white male Christians with impeccable credentials, but will most likely be someone on the margin, as Augustine and Aquinas were: \\"...a single Pakistani woman who has an abortion before coming to Jesus and is a budding film-maker.\\"<br /><br />Ruinous conclusions drawn from an interesting comparison. Perhaps the problem lies in misuse of the sources he returns to for inspiration. Or far more likely, perhaps the problem is intrinsic to the sources. Because there is a pattern.<br /><br />A more comprehensive and practical presentation from the Protestant understanding (marginalized in this book) is \\"How Now Shall We Live\\". Christianity needs to be understood as a comprehensive world-view before one can easily deal with the disbelievers and unbelievers. And you don't have to give up on truth in the process.	2001-01-29

The book gets one star for the author having read the material hecritiques -- an innovative approach for his position. But reading does't mean understanding. Quick take: the book's language may make Darwinians feel good, but will ill-prepare them for actual issues. It systematically misrepresents Darwin's critics. Don't believe me? It's your money.<br /><br />The book starts out explaining it won't question sincerity or intent of people who criticize Darwinian theory. (Questioning Darwinism is automatically taken as creationism). Thereafter, such people are characterized as doing things slyly and being disingenuous. People with Ph.D's and publication history in fields the author has no background in are described as \\"slightly less cartoonish\\" than others. The author is a philosophy professor, defending claims of biology from critiques by others with backgrounds in biology and mathematics.<br /><br />A technique the author uses is to put quote marks around words. This negates what someone says without having to address content. For example, he might report another author says \\"by definition\\"the \\"empirical evidence\\" shows the \\"truth\\" is X. By putting positive words like \\"by definition\\" and\\"truth\\" in quotes, it negates them without analysis.<br /><br />It creates a sense in the reader's mind that it's NOT truth being discussed, but only what some other person THINKS is truth.  It associates an emotion of doubt, in the reader's mind, with the word being quoted. When the reader is done, he is left with the sense something has been refuted, when it's only typography. Quotation of single words should red-flag any reader. \\"Tower of Babel\\" is filled with quote negation, sometimes a dozen per page. It's partly why the book may make Darwinians feel good, but will ill-prepare them for actual issues.<br /><br />The author enjoys differences between groups critiquing Darwinism; some analysis has changed over time. I guess that's unusual. The practical upshot is it allows the author to make a point, then pick the group that can be made to look most absurd in contrast. Raelions, a UFO cult, are grouped with all other Darwin-doubters. Never heard of them before, but they make good foils.<br /><br />The author tries to lump Darwin-doubters in with post-modernism, Kuhnianism, relativism and so on. Christian writers have written powerful, devastating analytical critiques of such humanist follies for years. Now, as these systems come to a close, with error undeniable, the evolutionary position that developed and nourished them tries to associate the failure with the very position that has single-handedly fought them all along. Expect next book from author claiming Reagan was a Marxist.<br /><br />The critique of naturalism he contests comes from the observation there is now a dual aspect to modern science: the method (\\"testing ideas\\") and the philosophical assumption (\\"there are only undirected, naturalcauses\\"). The METHOD is common-sense and biblical. The PHILOSOPHYis problematic and cannot be proven (think about it). While it can force the search for material cause, it cannot recognize non-material cause since it's excluded a-priori.  A-priori categorical exclusion is unscientific.<br /><br />Intelligent design studies address a small piece of this problem through an addition to the scientist's toolkit that will allow rigorous mathematical recognition of design. Have you driven down the road and seen a billboard ad? Do you spend time wondering whether it was designed or is a natural feature? How do you make the determination?  At present, scientists can only do what everyone does: appeal to hand-waving and common-sense. OK for billboards, not less-everyday things.<br /><br />Attacks on design studies (such as this book and Baylor faculty voting to cancel an ID research center) seek to deflect scientists from a tool that has wide relevance. For example, determining whether a transmission is noise or an encrypted message. ID analysis wouldn't break the code, but would indicate its presence.<br /><br />The author is upset that ID researchers refuse to speculate on the designer, if such classification is made of biological systems. He doesn't know what to make of scientists unwilling to go beyond what the data says, being acclimated to Darwinists answering every question confidently with a myth-story that seems plausible, whether or not there is evidence.<br /><br />One badly needs to understand that, prior to Darwin, the dominant view was that humans were subordinate to God. Made in his image, but self-corrupted by freely made choice. Darwin seemed to provide an alternate path that made human desire and power the effective pivot around which the universe revolves. Humans were mechanically derived, thus subordinate only to others who achieved power over them. With Original Sin gone,it seemed possible to perfect human nature and build a Utopian society.<br /><br />The 20th century, from Marx to Freud to Lenin to Stalin to Hitler to WW II to the moral and cultural relativism that distinguishes political parties, was energized by the Utopian schemes Darwin seemed to justify scientifically, by redefining what a humanis. Christians recognize humans cannot create Utopia and act accordingly.<br /><br />Not being able to indoctrinate children with Darwin's definition of a human is worrisome to people such as the author. Never mind Darwinian science is stitched with fraud and deception (see\\"Icons of Evolution\\", Wells). This does not concern them when they speak of education.<br /><br />Those who are are trying to lead us toa Utopia imagined by flawed and corrupt humans are most worried about this: if people are subordinate to God, who will listen to university philosophy professors? And if there is an ultimate authority, other than myself, then ...uh-oh...<br /><br />One can try conforming desire to truth, or truth to desire.  Darwinians have tried warping truth to fit their desires and are now being called on it. Not much more to it than that, folks.

The book exposes a pattern of fraud and evidence misrepresentation designed to portray Darwinian evolution as fact. We aren't talking minor or obscure details here. These are the primary arguments presented to convince people evolution is unquestionable fact. Specifically, it shows ...<br /><br />... textbook accounts of origin of life (the famous Miller experiment) assume the opposite of what scientists and evidence now indicate was the early Earth environment.<br /><br />... scientists, including Stephen Gould, have long known drawings showing similarities between fish and human embryos are not only incorrect, but faked. (These same drawings were persuasive in Darwin's thinking when formulating his ideas on evolution). Yet they continue to be included in textbooks.<br /><br />... the famous Pepper Moth example of natural selection in action was demonstrated with staged/fake photographs, showing moths on tree trunks. Such moths haven't been observed to rest on tree trunks, thus color matching to the trunk doesn't fit the selection theory they are said to prove. More fraud.<br /><br />... the claimed role of mutations in Darwinian evolution is falsely illustrated with genetically engineered fruit flies that actually show the opposite of what Darwinian theory requires.<br /><br />Other chapters deal with the beak of the finch (wet/dry seasonal variations neglected), archaeopteryx (not the ancestor of birds; shows how cladistics and the desire to link birds to dinosaurs has led to some unbelievably bad science).<br /><br />An appendix looks at biology texbooks published in 1998-1999, showing how they present fraudulent Darwinian science as routine recitation of fact.<br /><br />This book does to the somewhat harder science of biology what \\"Degenerate Moderns\\" (Jones) does to the soft sciences of economics, psychology and anthropology. Each chapter really deserves a separate book; the chapters, while sufficient and heavily referenced, are really a starting point for unwinding each sordid tale in what is likely to be gruesome detail.<br /><br />While polls report the majority of Americans say they don't \\"believe\\" evolution, evolutionary claims are the primary pillar shaping what people think about life and reality. For example, the idea of humans as animals, with sex the primary purpose of life comes from evolutionary assertion.<br /><br />Take away evolution and you take away \\"survival of the fittest\\", racial supremacy logic (eugenics, Nazis, WW II), abortion, moral and cultural relativism, the sexual revolution, etc. The 20th century, in other words.<br /><br />While this book is a stake in the heart of Darwinism, simply showing fraud won't change things quickly. Darwinism is lousy, corrupt science, but it is powerful philosophy.<br /><br />For it's advocates, no amount of fraud and deception is too great. If evolution goes, it re-opens the hated matter of accountability to a higher power. Subordination to a higher power means one could no longer pretend life revolves around human desire.<br /><br />Evolution tried to scientifically justify putting human ego at the center of the universe. Removal from that position will not be meekly accepted due to mere fact.	2000-11-12

The author was a journalist who made a point of noting key thoughts when he came upon them while reading. Thus, the book is mostly one person's presentation of what he read during his life, which is fine.<br /><br />In general, quote books can be unsatisfying since they present small, out-of-context snippets of ideas. That was expected. The issue here turned out to be the title.<br /><br />\\"Great thoughts\\" generally suggests ideas that have stood the test of time and been found to be true. This book devotes 8.5 pages to quotes from Freud, about as many to Marx, Lenin, Nietzsche .... you get the point. While these people have certainly affected Western civilization, at least recently, they have also been proven to be totally wrong, often at tremendous cost to the civilization they have experimented upon.<br /><br />Can erroneous thoughts be \\"great thoughts\\"?  If you think so, this book will be fine for you.  Me, it drives up the wall.<br /><br />The author deliberately excludes quotes from religious figures, assessing there is so much already out there, it's redundant. This seems to undercut the idea of illuminating the underlying ideas of civilization, but I guess Marx and Lenin need more exposure.<br /><br />In skipping and out, as quote books require, I found little from those who opposed such ideas, repeated in this book of \\"greats\\", even long before they enslaved billions and collapsed the societies who adopted them. The author rather grudgingly admits conservatism is part of western tradition, but that's about it. It is significant the book was picked for update/revision after the collapse of the the Soviet Union. Do \\"great\\" thoughts need revision? These do.<br /><br />Basically, if the book had been called \\"Influential Ideas of Modern Material Humanism\\", there would be no complaint here.<br /><br />A much better book of short anecdotes might be \\"Condemned to Repeat It: The Philosopher Who Flunked Life and Other Great Lessons From History\\"	2000-10-19

This book looks at religion from a mostly psychological stand-point, the unstated assumption being that is sufficient.<br /><br />It is acknowledged atheism is difficult to defend (to claim God doesn't exist requires knowledge of everything), so rhetorical salvation is sought by the author declaring himself agnostic. The book then continues on, implicitly assuming atheism without having to defend it.<br /><br />The book presents people's responses to polls on questions of religion. Seems irrelevant. Is there value in a poll on why people believe Newton's laws of gravity?  An agnostic would study it to determine the truth. Only an anti-newtonian would take a poll to characterize people's persistent \\"wrong\\" thoughts. Again, the book is framed by a prejudice denied.<br /><br />It goes on to discuss human pattern recognition, myth-making and much Darwinian theory. Most everything but the kitchen-sink is presented as an explanation for why people believe in God, except for the possibility it is true. That possibility is excluded from consideration without comment.<br /><br />This is a bit of a problem, since the central claim of Christianity is that it provides a correct and sufficient understanding of reality. It is not a \\"special\\" kind of understanding, but presents the cognitive and informational facts which all historical, moral and physical understanding can be based. It is an evidence-based understanding of reality which demands that it be tested.<br /><br />The book does not do this. Christian apologetics (the analysis of the logic, evidence and historicity of Christianity) is mentioned once. The author reports he is aware of it and tries to \\"stay in touch\\" with it. However, the approach and statements made in the book indicate this cannot be.<br /><br />The book has problems defining terms and concepts. \\"Faith\\" is repeatedly used in ways that suggest \\"blind faith\\" is meant.  This is not what educated Christians mean. Faith does not mean believing something known to be false, or ignoring evidence. It's the finite trying to understand the infinite. The \\"beyond a reasonable doubt\\" in a jury trial. Or when mathematician Kurt Godel began his Theorem of Incompleteness with a statement known to be true, then demonstrated it could not be proven so, establishing mathematics (even integer arithmetic) contains true statements that cannot be proven so. Faith must be grounded in evidence and reason.<br /><br />This fundamental misunderstanding of faith leads to an erroneous analysis of the Catholic Pope's 1996 statement on evolution (Chapter 6), although another problem there was selective quotation of the Pope's statement, which excluded Darwinian evolution.<br /><br />The books' reluctance to define certain words encourages separate ideas to be blurred into jumbled mess.  The book defines religions a-priori as being myth-based.  Makes me want to know how many myths the author has read and the criteria used to determine this.<br /><br />By the time one gets to the part where the author inserts his head in a strong magnetic field to cause temporal lobe disruption in his brain, inducing a floating sensation (like an out of body experience), it's only slightly surprising to read the conclusion that's probably NOT the cause of religious thinking in most people; perhaps just religious leaders. Whew!<br /><br />The book had a surreal chapter analyzing arguments for the existence of God. Five are yanked from the 13th century(!) That is they were phrased centuries before a branch of Christianity degenerated into atheism.  There's been some activity in the area in the last 700 years.  As it is, the books' counter-arguments depend on using a word in a different sense than the original argument (like \\"universe\\"), then claiming the argument has been refuted. Kid stuff.<br /><br />Whenever the idea of a reasoned, evidential basis for faith intrudes, the book immediately dismisses it because \\"religion is based on faith\\" (remember, the author means \\"blind faith\\" when he says faith). This reflexive, narrow focus is unscientific.<br /><br />The discussion of Behe's irreducible biological complexity strongly indicates has not read -- or at least retained -- the argument. He simply restates the Darwinian myth of eye development, using the same Victorian-era knowledge of biology Behe dismantled. Similarly with intelligent design studies.  Instead of analyzing the implications of a statistical description of specified complexity, the author skips past, treating it as identical to 19th century science. It is clearly important to think there is nothing new happening -- or to at least make sure the flock thinks so for awhile longer.<br /><br />Still, the books' attempt to moderate is fascinating. As the book mentions, the author heads the the Skeptic Society. I often receive invitations to the Society lectures (mentioned in the book) at Caltech that quote Spinoza's \\"... ceaseless effort not to ridule, but to understand ...\\", then go to the lecture. It usually starts off with the author telling mocking jokes about religious figures for 20 minutes as the crowd of skeptics roar.  Someone stands up and gives a talk about how Moses was a fictious pimp, before the floor is opened. Between the denunciations of religious people as ignorant forces of evil, a skeptical question or two is posed, like \\"You recommended an unusually low mandatory dose of psycho-active agents for children caught praying in school ... do you think that dosage is enough\\"?<br /><br />Thus a conciliatory marketing tone in public books is a hoot.

A behind-the-scenes book on a \\"voyeur\\" television show might  seem surreal to those who were in a cave during the summer of 2000. But  since the participants knew they were being filmed, voyeuristic isn't the  correct description. More like, unscripted, unrehearsed, and often  tasteless, though I'm not sure there is a single word for that.  Some  insist \\"reality\\", but maybe\\"low-class\\"?<br /><br />Sixteen  people were deposited on an island in the South China Sea for 39 days.  Every three days, someone was voted off. Competitions awarded immunity from  an expulsion round, or an island luxury. A million dollar winner was  selected from the last two survivors by a jury made up of the last 7 people  voted off the island.<br /><br />There are really only 4 ways to win an elimination  competition:<br /><br />  (1) Luck  (2) Force -- kill or maim opponent  (3)  Conniving -- trick or deceive  (4) Merit -- earn by right of  performance<br /><br />Civilized societies exist to minimize #2 and #3 and advance  #4. The show minimized #1, forbade #2. Most people, especially the younger  Pagong \\"tribe\\", came expecting an outcome based on #4 (merit; who  met the physical and emotional challenges best). This poses a problem for  those who can't compete on merit; who are older, slower, dumber, fatter,  more unpleasant, etc. Their only chance is option #3.<br /><br />The suspense in the  show arose when 4 representatives of these categories banded together as  single block -- an alliance -- to remove the more talented or able people,  who focused on merit. The question was, \\"Will such an alliance hold  together when only the last two get paid\\"?<br /><br />In the end, the winner  was the architect of the alliance-of-the-unfit, a homosexual nudist who  expounded the worlds' problems were caused by religion. He will probably  end up spending a portion of his $1 million winnings for legal costs  required to dispose of child abuse charges when he grabbed his adopted  \\"son\\" by the neck and ear when he returned from the island, due  to the child's weight gain.<br /><br />North Carolina police indicated the second  place winner would be arrested if she sets foot in the state, due to a 5  year-old warrant for credit card fraud.<br /><br />One could have hoped for better  \\"winners\\", especially considering all the recent mud due to  Presidential impeachments, sex scandals and subsequent soaring approval of  those involved. The risk is children will respond when good behavior is  defined as bad, bad as good, losers are winners and  society is saturated  with this inverted concept to the applause of millions.<br /><br />The winner was  not popular though (68% thought the wrong person one), but those who  support him say \\"he played the game best\\". That is, ends justify  the means. But his unpopularity is NOT due to how often he lied or to whom  in order to create an alliance.  It is due to how the game was subverted  from the majority understanding of merit, to one of political  connivance.<br /><br />The game COULD have been about who met the challenges best  and was the nicest to be around. That a minority subverted the merit aspect  is what really annoyed people about the outcome.<br /><br />Interestingly though,  even those who were merit-based, and got kicked off as a result, came  around to think and vote that the very person who subverted it was in fact  the best \\"survivor\\". That is, they redefined their concept of  merit to include conniving and deception. They just couldn't put their  finger on what they didn't like about alliances (\\"well ...that's no  fun...\\"). Shows how tenuous civilization can be if people don't  understand the point. So the show and book aren't exactly zero  calorie.<br /><br />Shortly, another type of survival game called the Olympics will  start, Founded thousands of years ago by noted civilization builders (the  Greeks), it tries to be purely merit-based, to exemplify the aims of a  civilized society. It's been around for a chunk of history and will remain  long after Survivor shows are forgotten.	2000-09-13

The author beautifully demonstrates the intepretation of the US Constitution in modern times is contrary to that of its original intent. Well written and accessible to those without legal background, though  extensively referenced.<br /><br />He further shows that the original intent is  superior politically, logically and morally to what has replaced it.  That  the current interpretation that has replaced it, due to its internal  contradictions, must disrupt in time, taking any government based on it  down with it.<br /><br />The most fascinating point of the book, perhaps, is where  the author shows the exact point in 1919 where the Supreme Court first lost  touch with Constitution. Then again, in 1925, when it solidified that in a  ruling written by Holmes and Brandeis:<br /><br />\\"If in the long run the  beliefs expressed in proletarian dictatorship are destined to be accepted  by the dominant forces of the community, the only meaning of freedom speech  is that they should be given their chance and have their way.\\"<br /><br />It  was with this statement that US Constitution, as designed by the founding  fathers, being based on centuries of experience and articulated in part by  John Locke, was instead replaced by one based on John Stuart Mills and  Charles Darwin.<br /><br />Instead of the original intent of allowing citizens to  protect themselves from those who seek to strip them of their inalienable  rights (liberty as \\"We the People\\"), the courts adopted a  position that supresses that, stating that our original constitutional  democracy is only a \\"fighting faith\\" and cannot be held as  deserving protection from other \\"fighting faiths\\", even if the  people loath them and believe them destructive to representative  government.<br /><br />These poisonous seeds are buried in history but have been  blooming throughout the century, as judges draw on precedence and their own  personal cultural background as isolated legal elites.<br /><br />The people who  designed the US government and those who lived in it for the first 140  years would find the present situation a bizarre distortion almost beyond  belief and rationality. Certainly not sustainable and actually the opposite  of what was intended, achieving and surpassing the very European decadence  they designed to prevent.<br /><br />Here in LA, I've  been vexed to go to the US  Post Office and see the parking lots stuffed with pornographic literature  blowing all over the place while children praying in school is  criminalized. A demented society indeed. This book traces the legal  development of the insanity.	2000-07-10

Wish I'd known about this book years ago, instead of discovering it a couple weeks ago.<br /><br />It's a given that Nazi's are the perennial bad guys of  movies and history, with Hitler usually a stand-in for Satan. It's normally  overlooked that they had a specific philosophy, that most of their support  and leadership came from university intellectuals.<br /><br />What did Nazis believe  and why?  Why did they want to kill Jews?  Most people actually don't know  (some European counties even ban Hitler's book \\"Mein Kampf\\") and  that, to some degree, is by intent, though it flies in the face of  \\"... if you don't know your history, you are condemned to repeat  it....\\"<br /><br />In the 1920's and 1930's fascism was popular among  intellectuals in the US and abroad. It wasn't until after the war, when the  results became clear that many repudiated it.<br /><br />This book shows the ideas  actually lived on, tracing them through specific people and events into the  \\"kinder, gentler\\" faces we now call New Age and \\"PC\\"  and \\"Post-modernism\\".<br /><br />Whereas the Judeo-Christian heritage  focused on a transcendent God and moral law, fascism rejected that for what  is tangible and in nature. Nature and community assume a mystical role.<br /><br />Essentially, these things are the pre-Christian European paganism of  antiquity, coupled with modern media and armies. As part of this, Goering  sought to re-establish the ancient \\"sacred\\" sites of Germany ...  in many ways, Nazism was the revival of the cult of Woten, reborn in the  philosophies of Darwin, Nietschze and Romantiscm.<br /><br />These beliefs were the  unquestioned underlying assumptions of the intellectual elites in the  1930's and they remain so today.<br /><br />Marxism and fascism, far from being  polar opposites have much in common. Nazism = socialism + nationalism,  while Marxism = socialism + internationalism.  Difference is mostly method  and in the early part of the century, intellectuals would switch back and  forth from being marxists to fascists.<br /><br />This book draws extensively on  original sources to document the purpose and intent of 20th century fascism  to eliminate the Judeo-Christian heritage.  It documents Hitler's orders to  Goebbels and Goering to maintain leadership roles in the church, to  maintain credibility, against their will and how in his own words \\"...  after  difficult inner struggles I had freed myself of my remaining  childhood religious conceptions...\\".<br /><br />Hitler wrote how, having solved  the more manageable Jewish problem, it would be necessary to address the  \\"church problem\\": \\"The point that must be reached is to have  the pulpits filled with none but boobs, and the congregations with none but  old women. The healthy young people are with us.\\"<br /><br />And from a Hitler  Youth camp song: \\"We are the happy Hitler youth, we have no need for  Christian virtue for Adolph Hitler is our intercessor, and our Redeemer  ...\\"<br /><br />The book then traces the philosophy of fascism from it's  origins into the modern institutions of today. Not perfect, but an awesome  book  in implication.	2000-07-10

Seemingly overnight, the local grocery became saturated with books,  vitamins, food bars all specialized toward specific blood types. Dug up a  copy of this book (used) to see what it was all about.<br /><br />The book was  frustrating. It was filled with assertions about properties of blood types  but didn't explain what blood types were, or how they could affect people  as claimed.<br /><br />It was instead filled with individual case studies. You  read the assertions, then read about \\"Marsha\\",  \\"Laurie\\", \\"Jeanette\\", etc., and how those handful of  cases support the assertions. Statistical studies of a few hundred contain  no data to explain how the sample population was selected or the dispersion  of the results.<br /><br />The whole thing reads like an astrology book.<br /><br />One of  the blood type descriptions suited me perfectly -- to a \\"T\\". I  then had my blood type checked only to find I was of a different type. The  description of my actual type only fit me in one respect, but was  contraindicated by several other supposed properties.  The book contains no  explanation of how this could be possible, or indication that it is even  possible.<br /><br />The dietary recommendations are such that anyone would probably  be helped by following any one of the diets. Since about 50% of the  population is type \\"O\\", the odds of the book seeming to  \\"make sense\\" and \\"work\\" are statistically good.<br /><br />The  kindest thing that can be said here is that the idea seems to need some  more work or is presented very badly.

US	53075343	R22UGWAS68G83C	1573922285	751998454	Nonbelief & Evil: Two Arguments for the Nonexistence of God	Books	2	15	54	N	Y	Ineffectual, misses target from the get-go.	The book sets out to disprove God through the existence of evil and non-belief. While a civil tone is maintained, the argument itself dissipates early on.<br /><br />The  book sets itself the task of refuting the \\"evangelical\\" descriptions of God, but then initializes with a non-Christian definition of evil (\\"suffering and premature death\\").<br /><br />Who defines what premature death is? The author refers to median age mortality statistics, thus leaving the reader to suspect 50% who die ahead of the average (by definition) are indicators of evil. And one can only assume he means physical death. And suffering ... who can suffer more than a teenage girl having to take vacation with her parents? Is this evil or not? It seems so, from the author's sparse explanation.<br /><br />How can an argument against the God \\"of Christianity\\" carry weight if it is based in such nebulous, non-Christian terms? Why not address the problem using the Christian understanding of evil, or show why that is inadequate?  After all, the point is to show logical inconsistency/impossibility, right?  This book starts out mixing apples and oranges, trying to show one is inconsistent with the other. Big deal.<br /><br />I could go through correcting almost each paragraph, but when it is all over, my general impression of the book is that it is a request for someone to explain Christianity to the author. ....<br /><br />Three resources may be helpful to the atheist formulating arguments.  They reflect Reformation understanding (biblical Christianity): \\"Baker's Encyclopedia of Christian Apologetics\\" (Geisler), \\"Summary of Christian Doctrine\\" (Berkhof), \\"Christian Apologetics\\" (Geisler). The first in particular allows one to look up a topic and get the biblical Christian understanding and justification, such as the fate of \\"heathen\\", etc. ....<br /><br />Reformation thought recognizes God as perfect, good and free; what everything else may be compared to since He is not dependent. Biblically, evil isthe absence of good (God). Evil is not a thing. It is a deprivation like dark being absence of light.<br /><br />God caused the existence of distinct but necessarily dependent personalities that were also free (made in his likeness). Such freedom means the possibility of choosing to be separate from God. In light of the above, evil is thus when a dependent being claims claims autonomy. By asserting a dependent will is superior to God's, it separates from God by definition. This deprivation is \\"evil\\".<br /><br />Genesis documents the decision of two dependent beings in the Garden to separate themselves from God, to assert their will as superior to God's by disobeying, believing they were self-sufficient. As dependent-beings, they  cannot be, thus The Fall.<br /><br />The book asks why an omniscient God would cause such beings if evil would result. Non-existence (different from physical death), or not causing them, is evil -- something God does not do by definition, thus creation. God isresponsible only for the POSSIBILITY of evil. Other beings make evil actual.Their existence outweighs the resulting mere possibility of evil, by definition.<br /><br />The book claims \\"creating\\" something implies a prior lack, inconsistent with a perfect God. But creating has a connotation of time. God exists outside of time, aware of all times equally (the author addresses this by saying the characteristic is \\"unintelligible\\").<br /><br />The universe was created only from the point of view of someone who exists in it, in time. From the point of view of God, the universe simply is. Beginning, end, everything in between, simultaneously. Thus we have free-will from our temporal perspective, but God knows all that will happen. So He is in excellent position to know if it is worth it and what is required to defeat evil.<br /><br />If evil is chosen, as it has been, it needs to be separated from good, else it's nature is to impose its will on good, depriving them, interfering with good'sfree will.<br /><br />Repentence is when one realizes one is not independent of God. It is recognition of the desire to be with God ... Heaven. Those in Hell are there because that's where they prefer to be. It's not punishment. They have freely chosen to be separate from God, assessing themselves to be autonomous and superior to God. Hell is the struggle for supremacy that inevitably results when deluded wills confront others who also assert their desires are supreme.<br /><br />Of course, torment and pain results, but that is just a consequence of their nature. What they prefer. For such a being to be in the presence of God would negate their will, something unendurable to them by definition (being unrepentent) and contrary to God's purpose by definition.<br /><br />The book asks why God's existence is ambiguous. Laws of the universe should have been defined, then God should circumvent them by putting on displays.<br /><br />Well, He was in the Garden, until the Original Sin, when mankind freely chose to separate from God. That is human pride and arrogance put the blinders on. Presence, to those who choose to be separate, is contrary to God's nature by definition. For those who do not claim autonomy (repentant or sinless), God is obvious and present.  Not many of those (!), but many more try ... and get glimpses.<br /><br />Some look at a sign by the side of the road, 2-D with ink slopped on it and \\"know\\" it is a work of intelligence. Others look at the vastly more complex world of living world of living things and consider it more obviously a sign of intelligence. To accept the 2-D sign but deny the rest of reality, wandering around wondering \\"where's God?\\" is ultimately not supportable. The blindness that forms the question is a consequence of sin.	2000-07-07

It's neat to imagine doing personal combat with ancient evil as an 11 year. But kids aren't wise or aware. Re-read as an adult, the series is a missed opportunity,  instilling numerous problematic assumptions that can only mislead a  child.  The book is not &#34;Arthurian&#34; to those who know what that  means. It is the opposite. The link is that poor old King Arthur is exhumed  from the grave and reanimated as a magical totem. There is no exploration  of civilization based on codes of honor and the subsuming of human kings  under a transcending divine. Absolutely the opposite of the Arthurian  tradition.  There is no insight into what evil is. The bad guys merely  project an inexplicable sense of foreboding and darkness while engaging in  cryptic banter. Evil, apparently, is an emotional feeling one  &#34;senses&#34; without knowing or understanding.  The good guys (Uncle  Merry), always &#34;suddenly stand erect&#34; and start fighting evil  with incantations, magical talismans and arcane  tasks. Human action is  irrelevant. One starts to wonder why Uncle Merry is slouching such that he  always needs to &#34;suddenly stand erect&#34;…  So mystical forces  clash. The idea is there are elites BORN with special knowledge (instincts,  really) who act to protect normal people. We must assist them and do what  they say. That nature is magic beyond understanding. That the  &#34;fight&#34; between good and evil is a sort of game, not real, in  which representatives of good and evil meet in council together to decide  matters. Then go out to  play-act their roles. That good and evil NEED each  other.  All while appealing to create tribal sensibilities and notions of  Celtic racial heritage.  This will seem harsh to many who have gradually  incorporated such beliefs or like the books, but most of what is contained  in this series reflects the 1930's ideology of German National Socialists  i.e. fascism, gradually mainstreamed since then, now resurging in  popularity behind a &#34;kinder, gentler&#34; face under the banner  &#34;New Age&#34;, &#34;PC&#34;, etc.  If the world were different,  this could be a &#34;fun&#34; book. But there is increasingly nothing out  there to illuminate the truth behind such ideas; to show were they must  inevitably lead. There is a reason why almost every TV show directed to  teens revolves around witchcraft and demonology ... why the generations are  increasing into violence, body-piercing, open and aimless sexuality (basic  primitivism). Treating this series as if it has value is part indicator,  part contributor	2000-06-22
US	53075343	R2UKOHJKWYQFXB	0679435972	920269539	The Battle for God	Books	1	50	179	N	Y	There are better books on the topic. Disappointing.	The book describes historical activity of Christian, Jewish and Islamic fundamentalists opposing modernism in time-spans leading to present day.  Surprisingly, the book rarely explains what or why \\"fundamentalists\\" believe as they do. Nor are modernists clearly illuminated.<br /><br />Instead, it's a socio-political history of groups.  Group-X did this, then Group-Y did that, with each group treated as an unexplained black-box. There are occasional comments in passing like \\" ... they believed the Pope to be the Anti-Christ...\\" without explanatory background.<br /><br />I started by reading just sections on Christianity, something familiar. Found them so askew, didn't read about Judaism and Islam, since I would expect to be miseducated.<br /><br />There are so many problems with this book, I recommend avoiding it. Instead see \\"The Universe Next Door:A Basic Catalog of World-views\\"(Sire) and \\"How Now Shall we Live?\\"(Colson and Pearcy). Both books ably live up to the promise of deepening (revolutionizing?) your understanding of the modern world, without religious jargon. If you want to understand \\"fundamentalists\\", read something they might recommend, no?<br /><br />Problem#1: Use of term \\"fundamentalist\\". Don't know any orthodox people describing themselves with the word. It's a label (like \\"boogey-man\\") used by irreligious (media), to categorize and dismiss those they don't understand. Use here seems a marketing ploy to bring in PBS crowd (hi!).<br /><br />Problem#2: The author doesn't explain what SHE means by \\"fundamentalism\\" or \\"modernity\\" until the terms have been used dozens of times. You get 50-70 pages into the book before being able deduce the central issues under discussion.<br /><br />Problem#3: \\"fundamentalists\\" are finally(!) described as those whose beliefs are arrived at emotionally. \\"Modernists\\" are rationals who emphasize reason and the over-turn of tradition (she says). Thus the books' combatants are defined not by WHAT they believe, but HOW they believe.<br /><br />This conveniently allows the author to proceed without explaining the basis of belief. If she went into the whys and whats, she would end up falsifying the basic framework of the book, which is ...<br /><br />Problem#4: The division of understanding into \\"mythos\\" (truth by myth-story) and \\"logos\\" (rationality). The author says religious thought emphasizes myth, while modernity is reason. Very self-serving, very wrong.  Consider the following Enlightenment ideas \\"rational\\" Moderns are \\"logo\\"-ed into:<br /><br />1.\\"There are no absolutes\\". Comment:The statement claims absolute knowledge, thus contradicts itself.  Are there no absolutes or are there people who PREFER there be no absolutes, so they can do what they want?<br /><br />2.\\"We can't know anything with certainty\\". Comment:Except, it seems, this one belief. Which, being an example, is thus self-refuting and meaningless.  It asserts an absolute truth as it claims one is not possible.<br /><br />3.\\"There is no truth\\". Comment:If true, the statement is an example contradicting it's assertion. Another impossible idea that excludes itself.<br /><br />4.\\"Only empirically verifiable or falsifiable statements have any meaning\\". Comment: This idea cannot be verified and prohibits itself from being simply assumed true. It is thus impossible.<br /><br />Moderns, when they aren't congratulating themselves on their rationality, base it on impossible beliefs that can't be spoken without contradiction by the end of the sentence.<br /><br />Contrary to the author, this is a familiar story; modernity is not modern at all. It is as old as history, documented in Genesis, when humans freely chose to disobey God to gain worldy knowledge, to be their own little god. Educated Christians understand modernity in exquisite detail.<br /><br />Modernity seems new because consequences of that original sin can now be so widely and rapidly propagated with the printing press and television. There are vastly more ways to be inerror than to be correct. Mass media only leverage the broad path to error that has always existed.<br /><br />At one point the author actually talks about \\"Christian Utopia\\". For Christians, Utopia CANNOT POSSIBLY be created by human design because of the introduction of sin into the world (\\"The Fall\\"). Even phrasing the idea displays the books' profound ignorance (or willfull misrepresentation) of the subject.<br /><br />Utopianism IS modernity, made scientifically plausible by Darwin whose Victorian-era studies seemed to eliminate God, thus Original Sin. The result was predicted and predictable; Karl Marx quickly adopted Darwin's science, leading to communism and the attempt to perfect human nature scientifically, to create a Worker's Paradise (60 million killed in Russia, 50 million killed in China). Then come the Nazi's (National Socialists) trying to create an Aryan super-race, also based on the science of Darwin (20 million dead & Holocaust). And then eugenics and abortion: the modern world. Now, 140 years later, Darwin falls apart (\\"Darwin's Black Box\\",Behe).<br /><br />Biblical Christianity advocates the METHOD of science (comparison of observation with reality). It is the materialistic assumption of science PHILOSOPHY that is in error.<br /><br />The only reason humanist John Locke could think it \\"self-evident\\" that all humans have certain inalienable rights is because he lived in a culture permeated with the Christian idea Man was created in the image of God. Darwinism has no basis for human rights -- one reason they don't catch on in countries lacking a Christian background.<br /><br />This is the history of the secular world: ripping-off the culture of Christianity, distorting it, forgetting where it came from, then impugning the original basis of their very own adopted (now warped) secular beliefs. The book does this repeatedly.<br /><br />In original Greek, the Bible (John) says \\"In the beginning was the Logos...\\" (logic, or reason). It is saying God, and all He creates is based on reason. This was a radical idea to the old pagans, with their capricious, arbitrary gods.  It meant it was worth studying the world; it could be understood. Out of this came the scientific METHOD (completely biblical), education, literacy, and even the stunted off-shoots of Christianity-Now-Garbled: modern utopianism and atheism. Which, ironically, don't recognize the Christian tradition they totally depend on ... but which does not depend on them.	2000-05-16
US	53075343	R2F4Q0525ZSENT	1569800863	26812800	The Turner Diaries: A Novel	Books	1	17	45	N	Y	Modern liberal humanism taken to its' logical conclusion.	Considering the book's reputation,  it leaves one wondering what the fuss was about.  Written in 1978, \\"The Turner Diaries\\" are mild in  comparison to current entertainment. The book would now make an R-rated  movie, due to violence. I read it in hopes of illuminating the intellectual  basis of racist groups.<br /><br />The book has no obscenity, a vague romance (no  sex), some violence. Racial epithets are scarce; surprising considering it  is a fictional account of racial conflict.  One hears more grotesque  epithets in 2 minutes of rap music than in this book.<br /><br />The book was  written to simulate entries in the diary of a member of an underground  fighting against what they called The System -- a culture and government  bent on lowering the level of society to satisfy minorities and maintain  power.  Those who see themselves being lowered fight back. Their enemies  range from blacks to Jews to conservatives.<br /><br />In that sense, it's not a  racial fight. Whites who participate in the System aren't treated more  favorably because of their race. The author targets collaborative  tendencies of conservatives, transformation of modern churches into hollow  shells, and the ability of modern Americans, saturated with entertainment,  to get used to any government corruption or loss of freedom as long as the  media don't goad them into getting upset.<br /><br />The author's 1978 predictive  descriptions of a modern affirmative action state seem eerily accurate. The  Rodney King incident, LA riots, OJ Simpson, etc., could have been lifted  from this book verbatim as far as predicting media, public and governmental  behavior.<br /><br />So why the intensely negative responses to the book?<br /><br />There is  a reason the 20th century coined the term \\"genocide\\". In 1859,  Darwin published a book whose full title was \\"The Origin of Species By  Means Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the  Struggle for Life\\". The last part of the originaltitle is usually  hidden, nowadays.  Using the Victorian-era science of his time, he  proposed life, including humans, originated by completely natural,  materialistic methods. Previously, it was understood humans were created in  the image of God. They therefore had instrinsic worth, but were distorted  by Original Sin (born flawed due to a freely made decision that introduced  sin into the world -- The Fall).<br /><br />This change seems abstract philosophy,  but has huge implication. Darwinian evolution seemed to replace God with  natural forces and,  without Original Sin, it became possible to consider  creating a man-made Utopia for perfectable humans. The 20th century and  billions of lives have revolved around the quest for a Utopia Darwin made  Darwin's new \\"scientific\\" insight, leading to communism and the  attempt to perfect human nature scientifically, to create a Worker's  Paradise (60 million killed in Russia, 50 million killed in China)<br /><br />The  Nazi's (National Socialists) sought to create an Aryan super-race, also  based on the scientific principles of Darwin (20 million dead &  Holocaust). After all, Nazism is only a logical extension of Darwin; why  shouldn't evolution be advanced by weeding out people based on scientific  (natural) criteria?  Survival of the fittest justifies any result, being  circular reasoning.<br /><br />People think of communism and Nazism as  liberal/conservative opposites. The only difference is pretext used; the  pattern of Utopian thinking is the same.<br /><br />Eventually comes eugenics and  abortion; if a fetus is a bit of matter unrelated to God, why would it have  any \\"right\\" to exist? Human rights are based on the biblical idea  that man is made in the image of God thus has intrinsic worth. There is no  other basis,  one reason the idea of human rights translates poorly into  countries lacking Christian backgrounds.<br /><br />It continues beyond these  obvious problems. Darwinian thinking enabled modern liberal humanism to  become the unquestioned modern world-view... the rose-colored glasses we  all can't help but filter reality through.  In it, the state takes on the  role of pushing the buttons of the automatons Darwin claimed us to be, so  as to create a perfect society.<br /><br />The \\"Turner Diaries\\" are  violently disturbing to liberals precisely because it uses the same  materialistic Darwinian thinking, a cornerstone of their belief system,  TAKEN TO ITS LOGICAL CONCLUSION. Liberal humanism, applied consistently,  ends up in what are now called \\"hate groups\\". Just another form  of Utopianism, whatever their specific goal.  Everyone feels the effect of  The Fall and wants to return to Eden.<br /><br />The author of the Turner Diaries is  a humanist, a materialist, a modern liberal -- a Utopian.  He thinks  Darwinian evolution is fact, that human existence can be perfected by human  actions, thus rejecting Christian understanding of human nature.<br /><br />By  contrast, for Christians, Utopia cannot be created through human effort  because of The Fall and the introduction of sin into the world.  It's not  the materialistic issue of race that distinguishes people,  but their  decisions as moral agents that lead to disparities in behavior (thus  results) in the world.<br /><br />Liberals are trapped; they need Darwin to  eliminate God and empower themselves instead. But the logical conclusion of  their thinking leads to death camps and genocide -- the 20th century. The  Turner Diaries just illustrate that, thus the hysterical reaction.<br /><br />But it  needn't be. Darwinian evolution has been falling apart in recent decades as  closer looks at the details of life -- unavailable to Darwin's  Victorian-era science -- show it doesn't hold up. See \\"Darwin's Black  Box\\" and \\"Intelligent Design\\", for starters.<br /><br />As  literature, \\"Turner Diaries\\" are merely duller than the usual  sewer of modern culture, if anything, but not much different. Pop in a  video ofthe award-winning movies \\"Natural Born Killers\\" or  \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" or read \\"The Turner Diaries\\".  You will be much less debased by the one that's taboo than the ones that  are honored.	2000-04-17

In short, the author pulls together current archeology and anthropology with ad hoc reasoning to come up with a story to explain the disparities  seen in the modern world, rediscovering Marxism in the process.<br /><br />After  decades in New Guinea bird-watching, the author writes in the prologue his  goal is to explain why \\"...Europeans, with their likely genetic  disadvantage and (in modern times) their developmental disadvantage, end up  with much more [material success]. Why did New Guineans wind up  technologically primitive, despite what I believe to be their superior  intelligence?\\"<br /><br />The author assesses superior intelligence based on  the native's ability to find their way in the jungle, where Europeans find  themselves lost.  In this way, the uniquely human ability to abstract  knowledge symbolically is discarded as a sign of intelligence in favor of  finding ones way around a jungle -- an ability found in creatures with  microscopic brains.<br /><br />The author says New Guinean's genetic superiority is  due to their not being affected by indiscriminate diseases like Europeans.  They were naturally selected for intelligence. Specious stuff -- and the  book is filled with it.<br /><br />The West obviously dominates encounters with  other cultures due to superior technology, organization, etc. This does not  yield the right answer, so these are called proximate causes. In order to  get the right answer (dumb luck), it is necessary to push the origin of the  advantage back 13,000 years into conveniently prehistoric times.<br /><br />The  author is up-front with his intentions; one knows from the start of the book that he believes people of the third world are the same or, preferably, better than we (he) are, despite  the actual results obtained, evidence of which we see around us generation  after generation.<br /><br />At times, the author seems unhappy with civilization.  We live in a world dependent on complex systems we don't have the time or  ability to understand. If ones feels guilty about seemingly unearned  material wealth, its easy to feel (falsely) virtuous by identifying with  those who don't have it.<br /><br />One major problem is the author assumes that  human history is only a product of economic forces.  He speculates whether  individuals have any effect on the broad sweep of history before concluding  they probably don't.<br /><br />Others who think like this are usually called  Marxists. Replace the book's take on aboriginal people with the proletariat  and the underlying philosophical assumptions lead in the same direction.  The author is probably not a Marxist, just starts with a set of assumptions  that lead inevitably to its rediscovery.<br /><br />Marxism has been discredited at  tremendous cost, yet keeps popping up to delight Pulitzer Prize committees  and PC types in academia. They share interest in pushing the buttons and  turning the knobs to direct the automatons that are us toward their perfect  society. They have adopted a material-causation worldview at odds with  reality; it keeps failing. They don't know why, since they are barely aware  of their underlying assumptions (or the alternative is unthinkable). Thus,  the same erroneous ideas keeps recycling in different guises, always with  the hope the next take will be the guide to man-made Utopia.<br /><br />A different  \\"assumption\\" one could make is that humans are moral agents who  initiate new chains of cause-and-effect without preceding causes. This  assumption is supported by most of human history in that people who accept  it as true create things of lasting value. It would have resulted in a  totally different book.<br /><br />By instead adopting the (failed) materialist  model of human history and treating people as automatons responding to  economic forces, the author ends up writing a book filled with interesting  but often selective facts, linked by irrelevant conclusions that can only  mislead people from actual lessons of history.<br /><br />Truth, justice, and fully  realized human potential will not be found by romanticizing the desolation  of the Third World or by propping up stone-age peoples while denigrating  \\"ourselves\\". Just the opposite.<br /><br />But there are those who feel a  spiritual calling they cannot respond to directly due to their irreligion;  they think they find it by taking responsibility for those worse off than  themselves. Others just know that if they can turn the whole world into the  Third World, it's easier to be \\"on top\\". Kings need peasants.  It is these two groups for whom this book will click. How else can one  explain the dismissal of math, science, philosophy, in favor of  \\"jungle knowledge\\" as a sign of intelligence?	2000-04-17

Perhaps no one actually read it?<br /><br />The book  starts out quoting a 1924 newspaper article in which the Mayor of Buffalo  urged Catholic action against the Ku Klux Klan to protect itself and the  country from this \\"un-American organization\\" (the KKK). Wheless,  speaking from 1926, when the Klan was mainstream in many parts of the  country, wrote ...<br /><br />Wheless: \\"This flagrant incitation to civil war  for protection of a minority religious sect (Catholic) under foreign  supreme control (Pope) in any other country might be high treason ... but  the point is not that now, but to illustrate the acute menace of religious  bigotry and intolerance in our country today\\".<br /><br />Wheless sees sexual  symbolism in everything. If it is elongated and has three parts, it is  obviously masculine in meaning. Or if there is reference to a door or  container, it is actually feminine. Here's the analysis that  results:<br /><br />Wheless: \\"The very Christian emblem, the 'cross of Christ'  is simply the ancient conventional emblem of the 'phal--s' and 't--tes'  ...\\" (apparently archaeologists misled us by indicating it was the  structure historically used by Romans for crucifixion)<br /><br />Wheless:  \\"Another favorite Hebrew and universal Emblem is the Triangle, the  perfect representation of the p---c hairs on man and woman. The famous  \\"Six-pointed Star of David\\", the National symbol of Israel ... is  formed by superimposing the male on the female p---c triangle and is of  very sacred significance.\\"<br /><br />If you are interested in the subject of  Biblical inerrancy, see things like \\"When Critics Ask\\" (Geisler)  or \\"Evidence that Demands a Verdict\\" (McDowell), \\"Historical  Reliability of the Gospels\\" (Blomberg). These books discuss the issue  in a gracious and informed manner, without an author's emotional problems  intruding.<br /><br />This is one of avery few books I would think a normal person  would throw away, assuming they were tricked into buying it.	1999-10-07

The book doesn't explain why people believe weird things, define what weird is, or make clear what the author believes is far, far weirder. For  better takes, see \\"The Universe Next Door\\"(Sire), \\"Modern  Degenerates\\"(Jones), \\"New Atheism and the Erosion of  Freedom\\"(Morey).<br /><br />The book's Skepticism is an oddly selective  defense of the status quo. Consider this list:<br /><br />A) Darwinian biology  (and the derived political science of Marx/Lenin and the eugenic/racial science of  Hitler's National-Socialists (NAZI's) and Margaret Sanger)<br />B) Freudian  psychological science<br />C) Anthropological science (Margaret  Mead)<br />D) Economic science (John Maynard Keynes)<br />E) Sexual behavior  science (Alfred Kinsey)<br /><br />Shermer critiques none of these, though the  ideas summarize the 20th-century. Each was revolutionary scientific  understanding. Each was built into day-to-day beliefs of most people.<br /><br />After decades, it was discovered B-E above were scientific frauds.<br /><br /> \\"A\\", while originally legitimate science, was foundation for  political/social theories that savaged the century with 100+ million deaths  and the enslavement of billions. It is gradually being turned into a modern  fraud, as contradicting knowledge accumulates, but is swept under the  rug.<br /><br />Freud constructed a model of human psychology revolving around  sex, even as he found it necessary to kick his wife out of bed to sleep  with his sister-in-law. Now dismissed as the product of his emotional  problems, Freudian psychology continues to influence.<br /><br />Margaret Mead  went to Somoa, reporting a paradise where \\"celibacy was  meaningless\\",\\"marriages form and dissolve  easily\\",\\"casual homosexuality was the usual form of  relations...\\". 1920's intellectuals thrilled to the realization of  their compulsions and elimination of Original-Sin. Thus was invented  \\"cultural-relativism\\".  In the 1980's, it was learned Mead  (married) couldn't speak Somoan and fabricated her account to relieve guilt  over lesbian affairs.<br /><br />Keynes developed deficit economics (spend today,  shift payment to future generations) which funded the welfare state and is  accumulating trillions in unpaid debt.  Based on what has come to be  realized as a homosexual vision of a childless future, Keynes writings  describe his desire to make heterosexual culture pay for marginalizing the  \\"good life\\" of homosexuality. Keynseian science was eagerly  accepted because it expanded government control.<br /><br />Kinsey's 1948 book on  sexual behavior was perhaps the most carefully built scientific fraud.  Drawing on captive populations of prisoners, many incarcerated for sex  crimes, he constructed a statistical model of human sexual behavior, then  projected it onto the public. He then concealed the nature of the sample  population. It was a shock to most (delight to others) that science showed  those behaviors were \\"normal\\", kicking off the 60's sexual  revolution. All to legitimize Kinsey's personal interests. See  \\"Kinsey, Sex and Fraud\\" (Reisman).<br /><br />And Darwin. Father of them  all. Defining a human being as a soulless bit of matter produced by random  occurences, lacking divine nature, he laid the ground-work for Marx who  correctly saw Darwinism as the foundation for atheistic materialism. Nazism  is another logical extension of Darwin; why shouldn't evolution be advanced  by weeding out people based on scientific (natural) criteria? Survival of  the fittest justifies any result, being circular reasoning. Thus comes  eugenics and abortion; if a fetus is a bit of matter unrelated to God, why  would it have any \\"right\\" to exist? Human rights are based on the  biblical idea that man is made in the image of God thus has intrinsic  worth. There is no other basis. (One reason the idea of human rights  translates poorly into countries lacking Christian backgrounds.) Darwin  defined reproduction as life's purpose, energizing Freud and the others.<br /><br />Darwinism, as science, is in shambles.  See \\"Mere  Creation\\"(Dembski), \\"Darwin's Black  Box\\"(Behe), and  \\"Genesis Question\\" (Ross).<br /><br />The author accepts the weirdest  beliefs, quoting Kinsey, unaware the research was discredited. How can a  \\"baloney detector\\" be so uniformly turned askew? The author  writes:<br /><br />\\"The flaw in pure skepticism is that when taken to an  extreme ... it cannot stand. If you are skeptical of everything, you must  be skeptical of your own skepticism.\\"  WPBWT rejects purity. The  baloney detector can point anywhere but at science-wrapped Skepticism.<br /><br />But there are two aspects of science: method (testing ideas) and philosophy  (a set of assumptions; the idea all is 100% material in cause). The METHOD  of science is biblical and common-sense, producing helpful tools. The  PHILOSOPHY of science is problematic. It helps the method by forcing  identification of all material causes. But a non-material cause is  unrecognizable, and science spins in circles--the provisional nature of  scientific knowledge.<br /><br />The materialistic assumption of  science-philosophy is attractive to some. Previously, everyone was  accountable to God. If materialism is true, that goes away (because God  & souls wouldn't exist).  It releases one from moral accountability to  a higher power.  Thus the Trojan horse: \\"Science (the method)  makes Sony Walkmans and so many things possible, but can't find  water-dowsers. Thus, science (the materialistic philosophy) must be  correct.\\" This is a seductive logical fallacy.<br /><br />Here are truly  weird beliefs the book implicitly promotes:<br /><br />  1. There are no absolutes.  (The statement claims absolute knowledge, contradicting itself. Are there  no absolutes or there are people who PREFER there be no absolutes?)<br />  2.  Everything is relative. (Contradicts itself, being another absolute  assertion of truth even as it claims there are none.)<br />  3. We can't knowanything with certainty. (Asserts an absolute truth as it claims one is not  possible. Self-refuting.)<br />  4. What a person believes is the result of  social, psychological or chemical conditioning. (Then that belief is also  the result of such conditioning.)<br />  5. There is no truth. (If true, the  statement is an example contradicting it's assertion. Another impossible  statement that excludes itself.)<br />  6. Only empirically verifiable or  falsifiable statements have any meaning. (This idea cannot be verified, and  prohibits itself from being assumed true, thus is impossible.)<br /><br />While  Holocaust-deniers, UFO-abductees & witch-crazed may be in error, they  cannot be as wrong as the author, whose underlying beliefs can't be  expressed without contradiction by the end of the sentence. They are  beliefs of desire, not reality.<br /><br />The book advances demented humanism in  the disguise of rationality, by attacking simple error and hoping no one  dares looks at those doing the critique...	1999-07-21

As my first and last reading in postmodernism, what immediately stood out was the turgid obscurity of the writing. Random page:<br /><br />\\"Apel's rebuttal of Albert's anti-foundationalist argument via the charge of  performative contradiction assumes that the a priori validity of logical  rules must be assumed\\". Example would be nice, but definitions and  examples are scarce and would cramp the author's style.<br /><br />After a few  pages, a greater realization: one can read for pages and not encounter an  actual idea.  Words, chosen for ambiguity, arranged on paper so as to have  no meaning when considered in sequence.<br /><br />The book is unimportant in two  ways: it is hypocritical and has no utility.  It is an abstract game in  which the author depends on 3rd-order natural-language word definitions to  avoid committing to anything specific. Well, almost.<br /><br />ON IT'S OWN  TERMS, the book is necessarily a final (meta)attempt to provide the  universal mechanism to avoid \\"cognitive dissonance\\", the  discomfort felt when exposed to another viewpoint. But that assumes that  cognitive dissonace is something all seek to avoid.  Thus, there is the  rejection of absolutes, itself based on a specific assertion -- the assumed  universal/absolute desire to resolve cognitive dissonance.<br /><br />Given the  record of intellectuals and academia in jumping on-board intellectual  frauds from Marxism to Keynesian economics to Freudian psychology to Kinsey  sexuality (See \\"Degenerate Moderns\\" by Jones) only to see them  collapse in ruins of error after thousands of Ph.D's and careers were built  around them, post-modernism can be seen as a self-defense mechanism for  academia. An attempt to declare that all human reason is inadequate, there  being no truth. \\"We could only have failed so monstrously if human  reason itself is unreal\\".<br /><br />Self-centered arrogance. Human reason  is fine, albeit finite. It is demonstrably irrational assumptions of  academic elites that are unreal:<br /><br />  1. \\"There are no  absolutes\\".Comment: The statement claims absolute knowledge, thus  contradicts itself. (There is the temperature absolute zero. Has much to do  with entropy, thus the cause-effect direction of time, with all THOSE  consequences). Question: Do you suppose there are no absolutes or there are  people who PREFER there are no absolutes, so they can do what they want?<br /><br />  2. \\"Everything is relative\\". Comment: Contradicts itself, being  another absolute assertion of truth even as it claims there are none.  Meaningless.<br /><br />  3. \\"We can't know anything with certainty\\".  Comment: Except, it seems, this one belief. Which, being an example, is  thus self-refuting and meaningless. It asserts an absolute truth as it  claims one is not possible.<br /><br />  4. \\"What a person believes is the  result of social, psychological or chemical conditioning\\" Comment:  Then this belief is also the result of such conditioning, invalidating its  significance to an equal extent.<br /><br />  5. \\"There is no truth\\".  Comment: If true, the statement is an example contradicting it's assertion.  Another impossible statement that excludes itself.<br /><br />  6. \\"Only  empirically verifiable or falsifiable statements have any meaning\\".  Comment: This idea cannot be verified and prohibits itself from being  simply assumed true. It is thus impossible.<br /><br />Post-modernism was  invented to protect elites from the cognitive dissonance that comes with  recognizing the irrationality of the assumed \\"enlightened\\"  beliefs above. (That, and to amuse the French: \\"Jacques, I can't  believe the Americans bought into us AGAIN...finally, revenge for all those  'I Love Lucy' reruns.\\")<br /><br />Once these beliefs are recognized and  eliminated, human reason does well. The reasoning that requires the above  to be self-refuting statements allows one to construct the mathematics to  send a spacecraft 30 million miles to another planet and arrive within 100  meters. Human reason does well if started from a certain point.<br /><br />The  author, of course, doesn't deny any of this (and cannot), just constructs a  preemptive defensive fog of imprecise words so as to cover all bases  simultaneously. This fog is dependent on using implied but less common  alternate word definitions. For example, when trying to address the charge  of self-refutation, it turns out the charge must be  \\"unloaded\\".<br /><br />\\"Refutation\\" has too precise a  meaning, thus the post-modernist has to \\"unload\\" the charge of  self-refutation instead of \\"refuting\\" the charge of  self-refutation.  \\"Unload\\" is typically used with respect to  physical labor. By switching it to refer to a logical operation, the author  creates a vagueness of meaning that allows the reader to fill with  imagination or assumption.  Deeply dishonest, intentional  miscommunication.<br /><br />She writes \\"for the self-refutation charge to  have logical force (as officially measured), the mirror-reversal it  indicates must be exact\\". First, I wonder how, ON HER TERMS, she can  know this. Second, I wonder what \\"mirror-reversal\\" logic is.  Third, on her own terms, how and who \\"officially measures\\"  logical force\\"?<br /><br />There may be a suggestive parallel to  post-modernism in science. Mathematical reasoning often contains infinite  series summations, or sometimes, additional small terms in the expressions.  For computational reasons, these expressions are often truncated to an  approximation. Thus the spacecraft arrives 100 meters off target after 30  million miles. The error has little to do with the arbitrariness of human  reason. 3rd order and higher terms were deliberately neglected, not worth  carrying.<br /><br />I think post-modernists fixate on these infinite series  (without knowing about them, being verbalists), missing the bigger picture  that to put a spacecraft down within 100 meters conclusively demonstrates  successful reasoning of high order, including the precise boundaries of  what one doesn't know. I suppose covariance mapping would be shocking  revelation to a post-modernist.<br /><br />While the book is UNimportant ON ITS  OWN TERMS with respect to reason, it is very significant for academia. It  promotes intellectual suicide of the current ruling elite that has failed  so badly.  Even as modern academics eat this stuff up to protect themselves  from facing the awful recognition of the concretely false assumptions of  humanism that frame their lives, it nullifies their intellectual existence  and prepares for the collapse of degenerate institutions, making way for  the new. Thus, some hope; the dead-wood is clearing itself. If it doesn't  go fascist, universities might be in good shape in 20-30 years.	1999-05-24

While this is an internally contradictory idea (since it cannot, by definition, be proven  correct), it can still be useful to a point. It forces one to identify all  the material causes. If you ever run out of those, science can't recognize  it and you end up spinning in circles (the \\"provisional\\" nature  of scientific knowledge).<br /><br />The idea of memes is an attempt to get around  the materialistic assumption of science by asserting a non-material cause.

The authors set out a noble goal of documenting the use of Bible verse-quoting to support or oppose various social goals throughout  history.<br /><br />This is an appropriate thing to do; correct understanding of the  Bible, which often deals with the most subtle of high concepts, has been  the original motivation behind things such as universal literacy &  education.<br /><br />However, this book fails the reader badly by adopting a modern  journalist's approach to the subject. Find a person who says one thing,  then find someone who says the opposite and present them as equals. End of  story. The method flows from the assumption of liberal humanism \\"there  is no truth, just perspective\\".  However, this idea is self-refuting,  thus meaningless; if there is no truth, just perspective, then that fact  itself is an absolute truth, contradicting the assertion. Thus the book's  structure is intrinsically misleading.<br /><br />Biblical Hebrew has ~3000 words  (modern English more than 1 million), and is a revelation that had to be  correct and meaningful over at least 3500 years, between vastly different  civilizations. One has to approach it with an educated & thoughtful  diligence. That people have misunderstood or misapplied the Bible, and  superimposed their own pride is hardly news and should always be called to  account.<br /><br />There is an entire field/science of carefully constructed  procedures, called biblical exegesis, designed to ensure proper meaning is  obtained. Hermeneutics then relates that to particular applications.<br /><br />The  authors give no indication there is anything like that, any way of  determining what the Bible actually means. The book just draws short  pictures of seemingly unresolvable Bible conflict. This leaves the  uneducated reader adrift, thinking the Bible is just a tool for control by  whatever interchangeable side wants to use it. So the Bible is put away and  the reader wanders out to pick up whatever instruction debauchedmedia  producers have decided to saturate the culture with today.<br /><br />While the  authors aren't overtly anti-religious in the book, they are implicitly  relying on modern culture to finish the job of leading people astray once  the Bible is framed as being on both sides of every issue.<br /><br />For example,  the authors seem to have no concept of progressive revelation, of God  superceding previous revelation with more sophisticated understanding as  humans learned and grew able to understand it. This is a major component of  the Bible (Old Testament to New), but is not explained in the reviewed  book.<br /><br />They discuss the acceptance of biblical slavery, how God even lays  down rules for treatment of slaves. Isn't that shocking to a modern  American? Why didn't God forbid slavery? Or snap his fingers and take care  of it? The answer is that humans were given free-will. Rules were laid down  to a totally depraved, Fallen people that he who knocks out his slave's  tooth should \\"set him free\\", etc. God let it be made known that  every human was made in His own image, possessing an intrinsic dignity and  worth as a result. But human free-will was not forcibly subverted. It was  for us to honor God by coming to such understandings guided by the  principle of human worth revealed in the Bible. A two year old won't  understand the sophisticated reasoning behind being kind to his sister that  a 30 year old does; the concept must be framed in terms he can understand  at the time (don't poke, don't bite, etc.)<br /><br />The irony is that the shock  about slavery in the Bible comes from living in a society shaped by  Judeo-Christian ethics. The moral outrage (misdirected at the Bible) itself  comes from Biblical principles regarding the dignity of man.<br /><br />So while the  book seems an objective study (except for the part on homosexuality, where  the author's seeming-objectivity cracks; there's probably the motive/story  there), quoting historical events, it misleads through omission of  explanation why such disparate views are possible and how they are  resolved.<br /><br />People hurt by this book might want to look at:<br /><br />#1) New  Geneva Study Bible<br />#2) \\"What If Jesus Had Never Been Born?\\"  (Kennedy)<br />#3) \\"What If the Bible Had Never Been Written?\\"  (Kennedy)<br />#4) \\"When Critics Ask\\", \\"When Skeptics Ask\\"  (Geisler)<br />#5) \\"Evidence that Demands a Verdict\\" (MacDowell)<br />#6) \\"A Survey of Old Testament Introduction\\"  (Archer)<br />#7)  \\"Emancipating Slaves, Enslaving Free Men : A  History of the  American Civil War\\" (Hummel)	1999-03-28

This isn't based on new manuscript or historical  discoveries, but on a way of manipulating literature that allows one to  construe multiple authors with different purposes, smoothed together by  editors (or redactors or mythmakers) who were trying to construct a myth  for some purpose.<br /><br />The problem with this book (& approach) is it is  based on a type of logical fallacy called circular reasoning. The  conclusions one wants to obtain are built into the premises.  He starts out  assuming the Bible is purely a work of human imagination, not divinely  inspired and written down by humans. This excludes any contrary  evidence.<br /><br />The technique then proceeds by deciding there are X main  themes, then goes through and groups those themes, deciding what odors and  penumbras of word sequence denote the theorized authors, discarding those  that don't fit (when the author talks about the clever editing, it's a  red-flag his grouping criteria failed at that point), then announces  (surprise) X sources have been \\"discovered\\".<br /><br />The only reason he  doesn't end up with X+1, X+2 all the way up to X+n authors, etc., is  because he doesn't consistently apply the technique, and/or the text is too  short and baloney can't be sliced any thinner.<br /><br />The author identifies a  predecessor book this way, called \\"Q\\" which, of course, undercuts  Christianity. The author writes:<br /><br />Mack: \\"... since we did not have an  independent manuscript of Q ... One would have to line up the sayings  between Matthew & Luke in parallel columns and decide between them  where the wording differed slightly... Voila. An entirely different world  of Christian beginnings comes into view.<br /><br />Mack: \\"no other text or set  of texts from the first century lets us fill in an entire history of an  early Christian community-in-the-making this way..\\" (translation:  there is no evidence for this alternate history beyond this method of  selecting among verses in Matthew & Luke)<br /><br />Further study suggests to  Mack and others, three distinct layers to this mythical earlier work (i.e.  the theory had to be puffed up to crank out more commentary on it):<br /><br />Mack:  \\"recent scholarship has found it possible to identify three layers of  instructional material in Q....the earliest layer, Q1, consists largely of  sayings about the wisdom of being a true follower of Jesus. Q2 ...  introduces  prophetic and apocalyptic pronouncements of judgement upon  those who refused to listen to the Jesus people. And Q3 registers a retreat  from the fray of public encounter to ... thoughts of patience and piety for  the enlightened ones.<br /><br />This type of gaming appeals to people of a  speculative nature. One can fill papers, journals and books sniffing out  new layers all without concern for it being valid.  Labelling the texts as  \\"Q1\\", \\"Q2\\", etc., also confers a sort scientific aura  to the work, as if it was mathematical and precise when it is exactly the  opposite.<br /><br />Burton Mack is professor of early Christianity at the School of  Theology at Claremont and associate scholar at the Institute for Antiquity  and Christianity in Claremont and has worked in the field for 40  years.<br /><br />Why work on a subject for so long if one has no respect for and  automatically dismisses the truth of what one is studying? As I read this  book, I realized the focus of admiration is the POWER of the Bible to  influence people, not the truth.  If one discounts divine inspiration one  would surely seek to rewrite it to participate in that power.  And,  indeed, Mack's conclusion from this exercise in circular reasoning? The New  Testament was written in response to the \\"multi-culturalism\\" of  the Mediterranean in the first century. That is, he discovered the motive  was just like the current fad sweeping his campus and faculty meetings in  modern America. Circular reasoning cannot produce new information. It just  superimposes familiar biases.<br /><br />This book is significant because it is  repeated so often. But as I read through pages of unsupported assertions, I  was most reminded of a book on phrenology, the science of reading the bumps  on ones head to predict the future. Impressive account of the shape of  skulls, but when all is done, you don't actually know anything except what  the author thinks. So what?	1999-03-15

NEWSFLASH: After ~2000 years in which the most brilliant minds humanity has produced (from Aquinas to Newton) have studied, commented and accepted  the Bible as their life, it took until the 20th century for the realization  it actually contains thousands of errors. Multiple errors on each page  even. Just think how stupid all those people were who joined monasteries  and spent hours a day for 50 years studying the Bible on bread and water,  or who fought and died for it's principles. MacKenzie must be the most  intelligent person in history to see through it. Right?  Wrong. Very  wrong.<br /><br />This book will impress those who know little about Bible, history,  language and scholarship.  For others who are interested in the truth, and  who have some education, about 50% of the alleged errors can be dismissed  due to their poor reasoning. 30% can be resolved with a few minutes of  research. The remaining 20% were interesting and required more extensive  research (for me).<br /><br />When all is done, what is left is lots of bigotry and  hate, a handful of copyist errors, known for centuries, mostly to do with  Hebrew numbers, and some still unresolved translational ambiguities.<br /><br />For  example, Azariah's age is given as 22 in one book, 42 in another. However,  looking at history of Hebrew symbols, the copy error is obvious. Further,  context elsewhere shows 22 is the correct age. Frankly, you have to give  credit for no one deliberately altering the Bible to fix this obvious  miscopy after it appeared.<br /><br />None of these few copy errors affects  doctrine. But does this mean the Bible is \\"Errant\\"? Only if you  don't know what believers mean by \\"Inerrant\\" (MacKenzie doesn't),  which is that the God's truth was perfectly reflected in the original  autographs and has been accurately preserved. The claim of Inerrancy does  NOT mean there are no human copy errors or there are perfect translations  (though there is evidence of divine inspiration of the King James  translation), or even perfect understanding.<br /><br />In fact, poor translations  like the popular NIV do have human inserted errors, by following a  translation principle called dynamic equivalence in which the translator  need only convey (what he thinks) is the idea of the original. This is  essentially license to rewrite the Bible.  By contrast, King James was  produced by a formal equivalence translation method that preserves literal  meaning. However, this author didn't seem to pick up on many of these NIV  problems, since his analysis wasn't functioning at that high a  level.<br /><br />There are several books in print that do a fine, thoughtful job  explaining these issues:<br /><br />#0) \\"New Atheism & the Erosion of  Freedom\\" (Morey; examines the assumptions of atheism, agnosticism,  humanism, materialism & empiricism).<br />#1) \\"When Critics Ask\\"  (Geisler; probably the best, most thorough (600+ pgs)  \\"point-by-point\\" type answer book. Not even mentioned in the  reviewed book, though published 3 years earlier)<br />#2) \\"Handbook of  Bible Difficulties\\" (Archer; another verse-by-verse approach),<br />#3)  \\"The Historical Reliability of the Gospels\\" (Blomberg),<br />#4)  \\"Christian Apologetics\\" (Geisler;one of best explanations of  Christianity)<br />#5) \\"Unholy Hands on the Bible\\" (Green; study of  the various translations)<br />#6) \\"The Universe Next Door: A Catalog of  World Views\\"<br /><br />Good Biblical resources:<br /><br />#1) \\"Interlinear  Bible\\", Jay P. Green (trans). Contains original Hebrew, Aramaic,  Greek, side-by-side with literal English & King James, keyed to  Strong's Concordance. Follow along and see the translator's  decisions.<br />#2) \\"The New Geneva Study Bible\\" (New King James  interspersed with background history, maps, notes on translation  difficulties or ambiguities)<br />#3) \\"Modern King James Bible\\",  probably best modern English translation.<br /><br />If the authors of this  Enclycopedia applied the same reasoningto their lives as they do with the  Bible, they would drive along a road, see a \\"falling rocks\\" sign,  get out (leave glasses in car), look around, not see any falling rocks and  proclaim, hysterically, about the sign being an obviously false assertion  intended to deceive and (shudder) CONTROL them. Not only that, but 600  years ago someone who SAID he did believe there were falling rocks (or even  worked on a road crew) did some bad things, so that further  \\"proves\\" the dangers of the sign.<br /><br />If the author actually  thought he had found \\"Error\\", I wondered why the book contains so  much extra nonsense that makes it look so desperate. Why not focus on the 20% that seem substantive? I came to realize the reason the book alleged  thousands of errors is for purposes of exhaustion. There are always many  more ways to misunderstand something than to understand it. The idea behind  this book is that if you throw hundreds of issues at an opponent, you are  bound to find one (even a silly one), he isn't immediately familiar with.  Then you win by causing \\"doubt\\", since Bible-based people tend to  be very concecerned about the truth. In a debate, those concerned with  truth are often at a verbal disadvantage compared to those who just make it  up. But that's OK. You know how it comes out in the end.<br /><br />Although it drew  my attention to some topics and inspired some research that actually  impressed me further as to the Bible's integrity, this encyclopedia is a  waste of time (I spent 30 hours on it so far). If you are interested in the  subject of inerrancy, you are better off with the non-hate-filled books  listed, that address the same issues, but also provide reasonable,  thoughtful & informed answers at the same time.	1999-03-04

This book is destroyed by Morey's &#34;New Atheism & the Erosion of Freedom&#34; (also on Amazon.com at a lower price).  Smith champions  &#34;weak atheism&#34;, the assertion that atheism means &#34;without  any beliefs regarding God&#34;.  Thus, the most applauded book for the  atheist position starts out calling itself &#34;The Case Against  God&#34;, then asserts the contradiction it has NO beliefs regarding God,  then goes on for hundreds of pages delineating lots of assertions about  God, all of which are flawed.  And people write reviews to Amazon.com:  &#34;Yep, it's great, there is no God, so I am god and can do whatever I  think best and don't have to feel bad about all things I feel so bad  about...for some reason.&#34;  The reason people think the logic in this  book is so good is because they share the same UNEXAMINED ASSUMPTIONS of  the author. By contrast, Morey's book proceeds to EXAMINE THE ASSUMPTIONS  of atheism, agnostism, humanist, materialsm & empiricism and shows them  to be self-refuting and incoherent.	1999-03-02
US	53075343	R3D7EJB2ABLYOU	0875523625	408439779	The New Atheism and the Erosion of Freedom	Books	5	19	43	N	N	Concise refutation of agnosticism, materialism & empiricism.	\\"New Atheism and the Erosion of Freedom\\" analyzes the arguments, logic and assumptions underlying modern humanist, skeptic, atheist and  agnostic thought, showing them to be internally incoherent &  self-refuting.<br /><br />After a 37 page survey of the massive impact of these  beliefs on modern society, the author spends a chapter examining different  definitions of atheism. He spends 4 pages describing the definition  \\"without a belief in God\\", showing how that if atheists assert  nothing (have no axiomatic base), they could not actually say anything  about theism.  The author then spends a chapter on the causes of atheism,  describing 10 different types of atheists. He sketches the biographies of  prominent atheist/humanist thinkers throughout history who developed  atheism to \\"strike back\\" at God, after suffering severe emotional  & personal traumas, or experiencing compulsions to engage in immoral  behavior.<br /><br />Morey spends 30 pages on the logical errors of unbelief,  outlining 13 of the most common ones. For example, #8 points out how  atheists build their position on self-refuting propositions like:  \\"There are no absolutes\\" (this is an absolute statement that  refutes itself), \\"There is no truth\\" (except the one just  given?), \\"Only empirically verifiable or falsifiable statements have  any meaning\\" (this statement is by it's nature incapable of  verification, thus contradicts itself). Atheism and agnosticism cannot be  expressed without simultaneously contradicting the ideas they assert. They  are beliefs of convenience, not reality.<br /><br />The author goes on to discuss  the errors in the hidden assumptions of materialism & empiricism before  closing with sample debates and a convenient multi-page chart of atheist  arguments, the hidden assumptions behind them, and why those assumptions  are examples of bad reasoning.Atheist arguments from top proponents are  quoted at length.  For example, a review asserted \\"The Art of  Deception\\" was mischaracterized, being a guide HOW NOT to be deceived  rather than one explaining HOW TO deceive. However, a full page is quoted  from the book which, ironically, teaches that one should always claim to be  misquoted ...<br /><br />The book is well done. The author shows the basis of modern  secular thought, instilled in everyone nowadays (Nobel prize winners on  down), to be false, dismantling its foundations in concise strokes. This  book effectively replaces whole shelves of other books, sections of  libraries and most of modern culture, as they are based on demonstrably  incoherent assumptions and garbled, emotional rationalizations. Once the  book is understood, and with practice, the reader comes away equipped to  fearlessly confront, control and defeat any so-called \\"rational,  logical\\" atheist, agnostic, or humanist, from Carl Sagan, to Michael  Shermer to Madyln O'Hare to the typical Internet debater.<br /><br />If a few  percent of the population read this book and understood how messed up with  nonsense they are, the world might become a very different place. This is  the kind of book you stock up on so you can give away to those actually  interested in the truth of things, or those who should be. Buy deep, buy  often.	1999-02-20
US	53075343	R2M5KFWIX2N0M	0684809184	534371781	The Gold of Exodus	Books	2	6	9	N	N	Boring account of low-credibility expedition	...When I noticed Larry Williams on &#34;Gold of the Exodus&#34;, the first thought was he was looking for a new way to extract money from people.  The book was, in fact, disappointing.   A con-man (certainly not a poster-boy for clear-thinking) and someone who comes off as Bubba (without the attitude) team up to sneak into Saudi Arabia and follow the trail of the Exodus to the real Mt. Sinai. Maybe Jabal al Lawz IS the real Mt. Sinai. If so, this expedition, to whatever extent it actually occurred, was a monument to poor planning.   The book presents little useful information or verifiable facts -- probably because the expedition didn't generate any. Large sections are devoted to describing the personalities of the two men; with a topic of such huge significance, who cares?  If you are interested in the history/archaeology of the search for Mt. Sinai, you won't get anything here. Something -- anything -- about the local history of the mountain would be interesting (what does &#34;Jabal al Lawz&#34; mean in Arabic anyway? Any local legends & history?   They show photographs of petrogyphs of a cow exposed in full sun-light on a rock. Looks new, not 3500 years old. How did it get there?  After obtaining a rare & illegal peek inside Saudi Arabia, the publisher decided the topic needed only low contrast black & white photos (but a raised foil cover) -- and how did they take those day-lit photos in the middle of the single night when they climbed up and down the 8500 ft mountain anyway, dodging patrols as they went?   The book clearly is intended to appeal to the prejudices of their assumed uncritical target audience; from the anti-intellectualism of the meeting with the stereotypically scary-arrogant university professor who condescended to talk to them in between tennis matches, to Williams running through the desert and falling over the &#34;boundary markers of Moses&#34; to detailed conversations reported from inside Saudi Arabian military headquarters.    As the book ends, bull-dozers are poised to eradicate all evidence of what they have seen even as they figure out they were tools of Israeli intelligence operatives all along. What a joke.  As a non-fiction book, it reads like poorly constructed fiction. It isn't archaeology, it isn't history, some sections aren't even believable.  As a fiction book, it is not that interesting, filling out what an earlier reviewer correctly described as a 30 page story with another 310 pages of stuff that isn't relevant to the search for one of greatest stories ever told ...	1998-04-10
