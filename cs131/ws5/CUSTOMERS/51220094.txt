Using new Russian materials, including archives, interviews and unpublished manuscripts, the author seeks to fully explore and explain the consequences of Stalin's Okhrana service and the file left behind documenting it.<br /><br />  Had this information come out during Stalin's reign, it obviously would have been devistating. It would have exposed him as nothing more than an opportunistic fraud that had betrayed his Bolshevik comrades. Some had been imprisoned, exiled, or even killed as a direct result of his treachery.<br /><br />  Indeed, when Lenin discovered that his close associate Roman Malinovsky had been a Tsarist agent, he was humilated and enraged. When Malinovsky returned to the Soviet Union from abroad to try and make amends, he was arrested. After a brief trial, he was shot.<br /><br />  While a number of authors over the years have downplayed the seriousness of Stalin's past as an Okhrana agent, I would disagree. Some scholars have noted the very fine lines of double (and even triple) agents during this period. However, it seems Stalin, like Roman Malinovsky, was more than just an occasional snitch for the police. I believe his past treachery was serious enough that a good number of Soviets, many in the Cheka/NKVD, were killed to prevent the information from becoming public during Stalin's life. There is quite a bit of evidence for this, which, of course, is one of the main themes for this book.<br /><br />  However, while this book is well researched, I think it takes it's themes too far. In short, most of Stalin's murderous ways and high crimes are traced back by the author to the Okhrana file and Stalin's attempts to keep it from becoming public. I think that this is, in the end, far too simplistic an explanation for Stalin's behavior and methods.<br /><br />  I also have a few other problems with the work. One, the author continually tries to apply Freudian psychology to Stalin. Many of Stalin's actions are said to be based on certain psychological factors relating to events in his childhood and other periods of his early life (such as being beaten by his drunkard father). While such speculation is interesting, too much of Stalin's behavior is attributed to these factors with no real evidence -- just the speculation.<br /><br />  I also had some problems trying to find out exactly who some of the author's sources were and how they would have known the information attributed to them. In some cases, I was unaware of the person cited and could find no reference anywhere in the book as to who they were and why we should believe what they had said.<br /><br />  Students of Stalinist history and the Soviet State Security apparatus will find this a valuable work and an enjoyable read despite it's flaws. It is certainly the most detailed work yet on an old mystery from the early days of the Soviet regime.and Stalin's attempts to keep it from becoming public.

I'll be the first to admit, as a supporter of capital punishement, that there are a number of legitimate questions about the use of the death penalty in the United States. However, the often used tactic by certain death penalty opponents to claim hardened killers are \\"factually innocent\\" in the face of overwhelming guilt continues to astonish me.<br />  In this book, I am most familiar with the case of the  super-villain Joseph O'Dell, so I will confine my remarks to his case. First, thanks to Sam Jones for his review on this board of the book. He did a great job of explaining the court aspects of the case. It's unreal that as I write this, only 8 of 20 readers gave the review a \\"helpful\\" recommmendation. I guess solid evidence doesn't amount to much for them.<br />  And, as for O'Dell being a \\"man with a checkered past,\\" as in another review of the book, let's take a hard look at his past. O'Dell had over a dozen felonies in his life, most of them for crimes of violence, such as kidnapping, murder, rape, assault, etc. As noted by Sam Jones, he attempted a shockingly similar crime to the one he was eventually executed for. Before the police showed to rescue her, his victim was told by O'Dell, \\"Do you know what necrophilia is? I'm going to have sex with you whether you're alive or dead. I would prefer alive, but that's up to you.\\" What kind of human being could say and do such a thing? Think about this.<br />  A man with a checkered past, indeed. And Mr. O'Dell once murdered another inmate while in prison. Need we we go on about this \\"factually innocent\\" man?<br />  The evidence against O'Dell in the case for which he was executed is overwhelming. It has already been discussed in one review and we need not go over it again. Anyone can go to the website(s) for the courts in Virginia and see the evidence for themselves.<br />  It is intellectually dishonest to keep repeating that O'Dell is innocent without a serious examination of the evidence and a discussion of that evidence. This book does neither.<br />  8/22/2005<br />  Response to \\"Jennifer\\"<br />  You're calling *me* naive? Let's go over some *facts*.<br />  First, you talk about hearsay, yet that is what you are engaging in. Everything you and Sister Helen put out is from the murderer's mouth. Who said that O'Dell was \\"forced\\" to defend himself in prison from a knife attack? What evidence do *you* have. Nothing.<br />  The fact is that O'Dell had a long record of over a dozen felonies (19, I believe, but, hey, who's counting?!), most of them *violent*. He served time for murdering another woman. And he almost murdered another woman, after telling her he would have sex with her whether she was alive or dead. That woman confrimed the account to me *personally,* Jennifer. We exchanged email the day after the fiend O'Dell was executed as well. O'Dell was a sick, sick violent killer and con man. He obviously suckered you.<br />  As for the Pope, with all due respect for his courageous battles against Nazism and Communism, who cares? He was always against the death penalty and gave support to many executed killers. Another brutal Virginia killer, Derek Barnabei, was also buried in Italy after being executed, after receiving an outpouring of support from thousands of Italians, including members of Italy's parliament.<br />  At least O'Dell was buried in a proper place. The cemetery where his filthy corpse lies is also the final resting place for many of Italy's most notorious mafiosi. They can have him.

This book is a collection of essays and articles that gives Noam Chomsky, as Clive Davis of the Times of London puts it, \\"a ruthless and long-overdue debunking.\\"<br />  Chomsky's fellow travelers lap up his mailicious distortions, half truths, slashings of the historical record, out of context ramblings, and simplistic conspiracy theories. But the authors here are having none of it.<br />  Everything is covered here including Chomsky's notorious anti-Semitic bent. John Williamson (another linguist like Chomsky) digs back all the way to a *videotape* of an MIT lecture by Chomsky where he is caught saying what he and his supporters have long denied. No wonder Alan Dershowitz has called this book the \\"smoking gun\\" that convicts Chomsky.<br />  The book is edited by two of America's best known ex-left wing intellectuals, David Horowitz and Peter Collier. The two write an outstanding piece discussing (and dismantling) Chomsky's shameless commentaries on Spetember 11th. Piece by piece they take apart his \\"slippery allusions, inverted logic  (and last but not least), rambling eviscerations of facts from their context.\\" (!)<br />  In a counter review of my review of Chomsky's newest bunk, \\"Hegemony or Survival,\\" Rob Gehrke asked me who was \\"paying me\\" to state (the truth) that all of Chomsky's books are the same re-hash of previous material. Perhaps Mr. Gehrke needs to spend a few hours with this insightful work. He may then have a better grasp about the man that inspires him so.<br />  Hopefully, this work will be the first of many that will break and expose the latest orthodoxy amongst the hard left. We now have a rich treasury of scholarly works blowing the lid off of socialism, communism and it's supporters over the years. Most of that same crowd has now drifted into Chomsky's orbit. No surprise since there is simply nothing left but a hollow shell from their previously unshakeable beliefs. In time, Chomsky and his ilk will be exposed bare, but for now, this book is a good start.<br />  To quote Clive Davis once more, \\"This collection makes essential reading, not just because it demolishes the great man's conspiracy theories, but because it demonstrates his chronic inablity to honor the truth.\\"is a good start.

The US is the number one demon in the world, the number one terrorist state in the world, etc., etc.  <br />     It's amusing to see all the people that love this book point to George Bush and say this book validates why so many in the world hate America these days. Have they read this book? Because Chomsky has it in for Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and every other leader America has had.  <br />     Chomsky got his start years ago with a work that blasted those that claimed the Khmer Rouge were committing genocide in Cambodia. He dismissed such people in the harshest terms, giving them labels as he does in all his works including this. I'm really not sure what motivates someone to be such a fanatical hater but, who cares? Chomsky has been proven wrong over and over. But he just keeps ploughing on through with more. And his fans just keep lapping it up. <br />     This book's thesis is that the US has had an ongoing policy to totally dominate the world for decades and that recent events (Afghanistan, Iraq) are simply a continuation of that policy. Never mind that there are loads of examples to totally dispute his wild claims, Chomsky's fans consider the man some kind of messiah.  <br />     If you've read any of his other pieces on US foreign policy, you need not bother with this diatribe.  <br />     One recent reviewer here said that this book was written for those that would give Chomsky one star.  <br />     No, the book was written for the disgruntled that have a chip on their shoulder and need validation that America has been the real evil empire all along.

I doubt most people will be interested in Julius and Ethel's letters to each other in which they repeatedly offer hugs and kisses and talk about how much they miss each other. That is the bulk of this book, unfortunately.<br />  I give the book two stars only because it does provide factual material for the public record.<br />  There are a few interesting letters in this collection of hundreds, such as a letter to President Eisenhower asking for clemency. But the repetition of mundane family talk and the like gets boring *very* fast.<br />  Ultimately, the book is simply another vehicle among many by their sons (in this case Michael, editor of the book and author of a long introduction defending his parent's innocence) to present their parents as nice people that did not spy for the Soviet Union.<br />  In the introduction he does his best to argue that Nikita Khrushchev's memiors were phony *or* that the Soviet dictator was confused when Stalin told him that the Rosenbergs provided great assistance to the Soviet Union. The fact is the tapes Khrushchev made for his memiors have been subjected to detailed voice print analysis and they are real. Even Khrushchev's son, Sergei, has admitted he assisted his father in getting the material published. And one cannot seriously believe Khrushchev's memory would be cloudy concerning such a major issue as one of the Soviet Union's greatest intelligence coups of all time.<br />  If that were not enough, there are two other books by unrepentant Stalinist intelligence officers; both indicate the Rosenbergs were Soviet agents. These works are available from Amazon.com and I recommend both. First, published around the same time as this work, Pavel Sudoplatov's &quot;Special Tasks&quot; identifiies both as Soviet agents. Sudoplatov should know, since he was the one personally directing the entire Soviet atomic spy effort against the US and Britain! Also, Aleksandr Feklisov was the Rosenberg's NKVD handler in the US. His book, &quot;Man Behind the Rosenbergs,&quot; written in 2001, primarily concerns his relationship with the Rosenbergs while he passed their information to the Moscow Centre.<br />  In conclusion, there are plenty of interesting works on the Rosenberg case, this is not one of them.directing the entire Soviet atomic spy effort against the US and Britain!

It contains corrections and added material.<br />  This masterpiece is critical for an understanding not only of the Cheka (forerunner of such organizations as the NKVD and KGB) but the foundation of the Soviet State itself. Without this organiztion, the Bolshevik coup in 1917 would have quickly foundered. No wonder that Lenin noted on April 3, 1920, \\"A good Communist is at the same time a good Chekist.\\"<br />  Lenin used the Cheka as the main instrument of enforcing Soviet control. Under this organization all the programs that later became notorious under Stalin (such as state terror, mass arrests and executions of \\"suspected\\" enemies, concentration camps, etc.) originated. Lenin himself stated his views clearly right from the start on November 21, 1917: \\"The state is an instrument for coercion...We want to organize violence in the name of the interests of the workers.\\"<br />  Felix Dzerzhinsky, the first chief of the Cheka, gave a press interview in early June, 1918 and outlined the role and purpose of the Cheka: \\"The public and the press misunderstand the character and tasks of our Commission...We stand for organized terror -- this should be frankly stated -- terror being absolutely indispensible in current revolutionary conditions.\\" Unfortunately, as history would later prove, even the absence of such revolutionary conditions did not diminish the role of terror or coercion under the Soviet regime. It would, in fact, maintain a core position in Soviet society for decades.<br />  The above quotes are all taken from the book, which is based almost entirely on original Russian language sources from the period of December 1917 to February 1922.<br />  The research done by Professor Leggett in this book is meticulous and unmatched. Even the (limited) opening of Soviet archives subsequent to the publishing of this work has not diminished its value.<br />  A must have work for all students of Soviet State Security operations.work for all students of Soviet State Security operations.	2003-10-22

Sudoplatov also directed undercover and partisan operations behind German lines during WWII. Later he supervised all atomic espionage operations against the US and Britain after the war.<br />  Still a Stalinist at heart, Sudoplatov offers few regrets for a career filled with death up close and personal. One of his first solo operations entailed infiltrating a Ukrainian nationalist group. After befriending one it's leaders for the better part of a year, he dispatched him in Rotterdam with a box of chocolates loaded with explosives. Later, he went on to supervise large roving killer squads himself, such as the team that assassinated Trotsky outside Mexico City in 1940.<br />  The book is filled with surreal scenes, such as in the &quot;Komandatura&quot; in the Lyubianka, where prisoners were executed. One section was outfitted more as a hotel than a prison. But as prisoners were given a &quot;routine&quot; medical examination, they were administered a lethal injection, then quickly cremated. Sudoplatov, himself arrested on bogus charges after Beria'a arrest, describes receiving not one, but two spinal taps while pretending to be catatonic (so as to avoid interrogation). His simple, direct language in describing these kinds of sequences is chilling.<br />  More than a few of the author's historical claims are either suspect or simply false based on information long available elswhere. For instance, his assertion that Stalin was not involved in the murder of Leningrad Party leader Sergei Kirov can't be taken seriously. He also offers suspect versions concerning the demise of various defectors and other Soviet &quot;enemies&quot; such as Agabekov and Krivitsky. In other cases he seems to want to have it both ways. He admits Alger Hiss was a paid Soviet agent -- but before WWII, not when he was actually accused.<br />  Regardless, these sorts of flaws can be overlooked. This work is critical for an understanding of the mentality behind of some of the Soviet Union's most notorious policies, actions, and crimes.Soviet agent -- but before WWII, not when he was actually accused.  <BR>     Regardless, these sorts of flaws can be overlooked.

He served as rezident (station chief) in Iran and Turkey, amongst other important duties. In 1930, after much difficulty, he defected and gave a wealth of information to the British, French and Belgians concerning Soviet intelligence operations in Europe and the Near East. The Soviets mounted repeated efforts to kidnap or kill him (including a particularly expensive and embarrasing failure in Romania) and finally succeeded after about 7 years. The exact circumstances of his death remain unclear, but various Soviet publications have admitted Stalin's killers from the Administration for Special Tasks killed him in Western Europe around 1937.<br />  This book is a translation from the French, which was a translation from the Russian in 1931. It is also a very condensed version of the original work. The result is very poor, which is very unfortunate, because this is an important work.

There are also chapters on the likely assassination of Walter Krivisky in Washington, DC, and the murder of Lev Trotsky in Mexico. All the subjects in the book had run afoul of Stalin or the State Security apparatus and were murdered or disappeared under highly questionable circumstances. As a long time student of such operations, I can say the author is well informed in regard to the subject matter.<br />  However, the are some flaws with the work. First, the use of the term \\"GPU\\" (a Russian acronym for \\"State Political Administration\\") is unusual in regard to works on Soviet State Security unless covering the very early period of the organiztion. What is now usually called the \\"KGB\\" changed names a number of times during the Soviet period and \\"GPU\\" was used only for a few years near the beginning. During most of the events covered in this work the organization was called the \\"NKVD\\" (People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs) and, indeed, this is when the organization was at it's most ruthless and violent. It's very odd the author would not use this term throughout the book and he only addresses the different names at the very *end* of the work instead of the beginning.<br />  Second, despite the title, the work is, in fact, barely documented at all. There are occasional citations, perhaps a dozen or so, to other books written by individuals that were involved in some of the cases under discussion. However, most of the narrative goes along with no citations or any type of documentation. Indeed, Dewar does not even provide a bibliography! The book was first published in 1951 and, indeed, at the time most of the crimes covered had been given little public discussion. It would be of interest to know what sources Dewar was using because much of his narrative has since been corroborated by other sources.<br />  Finally, due to the lack of documentation and the passage of time there are, quite simply, plenty of other works published after this piece that cover the same events far better. There are plenty of first-hand accounts, such as Alexander Orlov's classic \\"The Secret History of Stalin's Crimes,\\" or other narratives, such as Gordon Brook-Sheperd's \\"The Storm Petrels.\\"<br />I would have to recommend such works well above this one.inally, due to the lack of documentation and the passage of time there are, quite simply, plenty of other works published after this piece that cover the same events far better.

Books	3	4	4	N	N	Useful Work Despite Flaws	The author served in the NKVD/KGB in various capacities for 30 years before heading to the West. Unlike many defectors who left for ideological reasons, Dzirkvelov left because he felt he had been given a raw deal at his last posting in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1980 (while serving as a correspondent for the Soviet News Agency, TASS).<br />  The strong points of the work are Dzirkvelov's accounts of his \\"wet work\\" operations in the Soviet Caucausus region, Iran, and Turkey. There are not many first hand accounts of Soviet kidnappings, assassinations and other high risk operations available in open source literature. Dzirkvelov's accounts are all the more interesting because he is unrepentant about his work and pro-Stalinist views. His discussions of relations between Russians and other Soviet nationalities (Dzirkvelov being a Georgian) are also of interest.<br />  The book is less interesting as Dzirkvelov leaves the KGB (after threatening a well connected hoodlum in a bar with a gun) and begins to work for the Central Committee of the CPSU. Perhaps this is because descriptions of working in the propaganda arm of the Party as opposed to the action arm is by nature not as exciting. But parts of the story seem incomplete or rushed. Dzirkvelov does provide a fair amount of examples of the shameless corruption and hypocrisy at the upper Party level, but this is certainly not new ground.<br />  Also, while Dzirkvelov's hardline views are frank and interesting, subsequent events and information have proven many of them wrong. Clearly, his defenses of Stalin's policies do not hold up. Neither does his prediction that if given a choice, the various republics of the Soviet Union would stay put and reject independence (even the Baltic states, no less!). He comes off as terribly deluded from reality by his own ideological beliefs.<br />  In conclusion, I can strongly recommend the work for students of Soviet State Security operations and Soviet nationality questions.

From a young, innocent girl, to highly trained killer, to notorious celebrity in South Korea, this book tells her incredible story.<br />  Written with assistance from the KCIA -- several years after a reprieve from a death sentence for mass murder -- this book is yet another damning expose of the North Korean regime. It traces her intensive training and indoctrination at various secret North Korean facilities, the terror-bombing of a South Korean airliner, and, eventually, her celebrity status in South Korea (Miss Kim received hundreds of marriage proposals after going public). Particularly insightful is her deprogramming in South Korea after her capture and her reactions to the new world she would now live in.	2003-08-07

The NYT website admits on it's Pulitzer page that his reporting has been debunked by various sources. The fact that the terror famine in Ukraine in the early 1930's wiped out millions is simply not in dispute by any serious researchers anymore. What has not received in depth coverage, until now, is the major role Duranty's reporting played in shielding this massive horror from the rest of the world.<br />  The terror famine in Ukraine was one of the great crimes of the 20th century. Yet it has remained obscured behind other mass murders, such as the Nazi \\"Final Solution\\" and the \\"Killing Fields\\" of the Khmer Rouge. This book fully documents how this tragic omission from the mainstream historical record came to pass.	2003-07-16

He proposed to King Henry VIII a new shipping route to the Orient via an as yet uncharted northern route. It concludes with the Russian nuclear icebreaker \\"Yamal\\" making the first successful boat trip directly to the Pole in 1993.<BR>   In between the reader follows various explorers from Europe (and eventually the US and Canada) for several centuries as they brave the harsh Arctic enviroment to reach the North Pole. While the earliest attempts were for economic pursuits, eventually hardy adventurers became the norm. The tales are incredible, especially considering the lack of advanced equipment and back-up proceedures the explorers used through the early 20th century. No surprise that many perished or were never heard from again. <BR>    One particularly interesting aspect of this work is the extensive use of first hand accounts by the explorers themselves. Most of the explorers kept logs and diaries of their travels (something to do during the long, cold days and nights that stretched into months and even years on the journeys). Some of the writings are quite dramatic and poignant, such as those of Commander George Washington DeLong (1844-1881). His writings were found along with his body and those of his companions after they had frozen to death.  <BR>    A very well produced work that spans over 400 years of man's quest for the North Pole.	2003-01-17

The story begins in the English countryside with the apparent murder or suicide of an American at his estate. The reader is then taken to America in flashback, where the story leads up to the events in England. Indeed, Holmes and Watson are not the central characters for a large segment of this book, which is unusual in the series. <BR> The story concludes back in England with yet more plot twists, including the unseen hand of the evil, and longtime Holmes nemisis, Professor Moriarity.	2002-03-12

Compared to the classic series \\"How to Kill,\\" by John Minnery, it is to some degree. However, the book was, in fact, used as a guide in a successful contract hit in Maryland a few years ago. The perpetrators were caught only because after the hit, the contractor kept calling the victim's ex-husband demanding payment. The husband could not provide payment until the victim's estate was cleared by the courts. But the killer, James Perry, was simply unwilling or unable to understand this simple fact. His repeated phone calls to the victim's ex-husband were recorded by the police and sealed the case against both men.<br />  So, despite claims here to the contrary, this book could be used to carry out successful contract hits...	2002-03-12

It's loaded with just about every phrase you could think of dealing with relationships, love, friendship, etc.<br />  One does not even need to have a command of Russian to use the book. In addition, there is quite a bit of practical information such as Russian customs, laws, holidays, names, etc.<br />  As someone who speaks some Russian I also found the book to be a good grammar and Russian language tutorial.<br />  Definately a book worth every penny.	2002-03-12

He also updated this particular book in 1999 to adapt his techniques to modern phone systems and the internet (&quot;21st Century Revenge: Down and Dity Tactics for the Millennium&quot;).<br />  There is a &quot;Part II&quot; to this work, which was written by George Carpenter. In that piece, the revenge tactics require the perpetrator to sacrifice some anonymnity and risk exposure. It is also an absolutely hilarious work. The chapter &quot;Trashing a House in Thrity Minutes,&quot; is a revenge classic in it's own right.	2002-03-12

It's certainly a major contribution on the history of US and Soviet intelligence operations. Submarines have been (and still are) key components in the areas of espionage and intelligence. Yet their role has never been discussed or explored before in the way this book does.<br />  The book is also useful in the history of US and Soviet cold war diplomacy and strategic policy. The book also provides insight as to the role submarines played in some of the most famous events in the cold war, such as the Cuban missle crisis.<br />  In addition, the book reads like a great spy thriller or adventure book. Passages describing the atmosphere in a sub as it's being depth-charged, or narrating the escape from a damaged vessel during a storm on the high seas, are riveting.	2002-03-12

These are fair remarks, indeed my copy has worn very quickly as well. However, the softcover edition does not have this problem and it is also easier to transport around.<br />  The other negatives seemed to be by advanced students of the Russian language. I would certainly expect a linguist to have some quibbles and also to have other books they would use and recommend (such as one reviewer's endorsement of the, indeed,  outstanding Daum/Schenk Russian verb dictionary). But for most users this book will be outstanding. For American English speakers of Russian I would say it is a must.	2002-03-12

Having been to all the islands of Hawaii I can say this work really catches the flavor of the place. Twain narrates his own adventures as well as providing his unique commentary on the customs, culture and history of the islands.<br />  A very entertaining piece, particularly for those who have been to Hawaii or are planning a trip.	2002-03-12

People would be very surprised at the frequently rough relationships between defectors and the US intelligence community. At any rate, the US does not dictate or control what these people write.<br />  Rather than focus on some of the many titilating stories in the book, this work is best used as a window on a very strict, ruthless dictatorship. Not many works can provide the kind of insight as this one.	2002-03-01

This was because of cheap and shallow political gestures against the Soviet Union made by Romania, such as sending athletes to the Olympics during the Soviet boycott. Meanwhile, the regime did Moscow's bidding where it really counted and also repressed the Romanian people to devistating extremes.<BR> This book provides useful insight into many of the outrageous actions by the Romanian government and US refusal to do anything meaningful about it.	2002-03-01

It will also be useful for boaters going out to the Cays, although there are no detailed depth numbers. Good diving sites are marked.  Points  of interest, resorts, archeological sites, etc., are marked. Road quality  and seasonality are indicated.  The map also indicates geographical  information such as elevation, swamp areas, and reefs.  The map also gives  most of this information for immediate border areas of Guatemala and  Mexico.  Well worth the money if one is going to be exploring without a  guide or tour group.	1999-08-04
