Therefore, instead of criticizing, I would rather focus this review on the strengths, of which there are many, of this book. <br /> <br />Throughout the book, Kaplan stresses that foreign policy should be based on a realistic appraisal of human nature. He points out that before the first president was sworn in, the rules of impeachment were established. He points to the work of James Madison who felt that men are so far beyond redemption that the only solution is to set ambition against ambition, and interest against interest. <br /> <br />Kaplan points out that the evils of the twentieth century arose from populist movements that were exploited and amplified by technologies. His example are the Nazis and Bolsheviks who, once in power, used industrial technologies to maintain power and commit crimes.  He warns that today populist movements permeate the world. These movements can disrupt social order as well as change political and economic structures. Currently these populist movements are fueled with religious zealotry and computer age technology.  These movements are inflamed by the injustices that capitalism naturally produces.  <br /> <br />Kaplan challenges Western policymakes who assert that ethnic and religious unrest is caused by political oppression by pointing out that it is political freedom that often unleashes violence. Peacemaking requires centralization of power. The historic truth is that democratizations is a long process before infrsstructures stabilize. To those who assert that democratic processes in Arabian Middle-East will faciliate peace with Israel, Kaplan would say 'think again' since liberalization may unleash fanantic anti-Israeli forces. Insistence on democratic elections in areas of the world without the dialogue of the Enlightenment is asking for trouble. He reminds us that national boundaries, for example Iraq, were drawn by European colonialists and these boundaries have yet to disintegrate under the forces of ethinic, religious, and geographic forces. As the developing world becomes more urban, he warns us that battlefields of the future will be urban. Terrorists and cybercriminals will use a vast range of atrocities as their methods of combat. Kaplan points out that Saddam Hussein was willing to fight us with conventional weapons against our conventional weapons. Those that replace him will not be so foolish. When cultures fail to compete technologically, Syria and Saudi Arabia come to mind, their naturally agressive young males become tribal in thier violence. More iceberts ahead!  <br /> <br />Kaplan points out that mature statesmen, such as General George Marshall, sought not solutions but a dynamic process of resolution and moving on to the next conflict. Kaplan points out that the humanitarian eforts to rebuild Europe were really about containment of the Soviets. An example of realistic policy that can backfire is the approach to Hitler. He at first was seen as a pesty dictator and the re-armament of Germany was seen as a control on the Soviets, who under Stalin were proven to be murderers. It was not until Hitler's insane ambitions were fully realized that the shifts occurred and the anti-Communist Churchill formed an alliance with Stalin to destroy an incredible poison that had grown in Germany. <br /> <br />Kaplan agrees with Isaiah Berlin's summary of Churchill: \\"Churchill's central organizing principle of his moral and intellectual universe is a histroic imagination so comprehensive as to encase the whole of the present and the whole of the future.\\"  Berlin saw Churchill's \\"strongest sense in the sense of the past...acquainted with the darkness.\\" Kaplan says that like all wise men, he thought tragically. Kaplan gives us a defense of Chamberlain since he built up Britain's defenses while testing Hitler's real intentions, which gained time and united public opinion behind the government for an eventual fight.  Kaplan sees our situation as similar to the late British Victorians who had to deal with 'nasty little wars in anarchic corners of the world.' <br /> <br />After a review of Churchill's writings about his experiences in the Sudan, Kaplan turns to the works of Livy regarding Hannibal. Rome's victory in the Second Punic War, like America's in World War II, made it a universal power. Hannibal had the advantage of attacking an enemy morally exhauseted from this war. By the time the Roman Senate realized it had to act, war was the only choice. Kaplan and Livy point out that it was primitive democracy that made Rome a nation which Carthage was not. Thus Rome's political debates gave it stability which Kaplan says anticipates Machiavelli's assertion that successful states require a modest degree of turmoil for healthy political dynamics. Kaplan also relates Hannibal's defeat to Vietnam with \\"unwise leaders try to conquer too much, too far away.\\" <br /> <br />Kaplan turns to Sun-Tzu's concept that the 'highest excellence' is never having to fight, for battle signifies a political failure. Kaplan summarizes Sun-Tzu thus; \\"The best way to avoid war - the violent result of political failure - is to think strategically. Thus the strategic pursuit of self-interest is not a cold and amoral pseudo-science but the moral act of those who know the horrors of battle and seek to avoid them.\\" <br /> <br />Kaplan next turns to Thucydides' Peloponnesian War which he thinks may be the seminal work of international relations theory of all time, influencing Hobbes, Clausewitz, Kennan, and Kissinger. Thucydides' notion is that self-interst gives birth to effort and effort to options which was a corrective to the extreme fatilism of both Marxism and medieval Christianity. Athens and Spart came to war becuase of uncontrollable allies: a reason that Russia, Germany, France, and Britain went to war in 1914. Thucydides saw human behavior as guided by fear, self-interest,and honor, all of which can lead to war and instability. A political crises occurs when instincts and anarchy triumph over laws and politics. The solution is to manage fear, self-intersts, and honor. It is with Thucydides that the concept of the balance of power enters political thought. <br /> <br />Kaplan does a good job of connecting Thucydides's view of Athens with a view of the United States. Athens had no tragic sense of the future, thinking their greatness was destined forever, and thus thinking they could act without consequence. They were fearless and arrogant. Thus they lacked practical and prudent policy. Just as in Vietnam, Athenians ingnored signs of danger as they became more and more involved. Power and affluence blinded the Athenians. Kaplan says the lesson is that the more socially and economically advanced the times, the more necessary it is for leaders to maintain a sense of their societie's fallibility and vulnerability. <br /> <br />Kaplan summarizes this discussion by asserting that groups will be in competition and thus states must maintain maneuverability. States act good or bad as they maneuver for advantage. \\"Historically grounded liberalism recognizes that liberty did not arise from abstract reflection ... but from difficult political choices made by rulers acting on self interest.\\"	2005-10-09
US	35501691	R2XQKMRMMUGDKS	061842251X	87970134	Understanding The Lord of the Rings: The Best of Tolkien Criticism	Books	5	58	61	N	N	Clear, comprehensive, and insightful	This is an excellent collection of essays on various aspects and interpretations of Tolkein's Lord of the Rings.  <br /> <br />I would first like to highlight some of the high points of specific essays and then highlight some of the overarching conceptualization of Tolkein's themes.  <br /> <br />C.S. Lewis offers an excellent essay on the Dethronement of Power which explains in as clear a manner as I have ever read, the Christian philosophical underpinning and explanation as to the corrupting nature of power. Why does power corrupt? Lewis asserts that all earthly power is illusion and frail in comparison to the source of all true power, which he sees as God. Thus, when given access to this force, even when intentions are good, the power corrupts because it is not in the hands of its rightful owner, God in Heaven. Whether one believes or does not believe this concept, it does correspond with Tolkein's world view expressed in the Lord of the Rings. <br /> <br />W. H. Auden's essay on the Quest Hero resonates with the works of Joseph Campbell especially when he analyzes the concept of the heroic friendship, using Frodo and Sam as the example. Auden links the heroic quest to the quest of all human beings for transcendence. He sees human nature as a nature continually in quest of itself, 'obliged at every moment to transcend what it was a moment before'.  <br /> <br />Two essays, written separetely by Rose Zimbardo and Patricia Meyer Spacks deal with the relationship between moral vision, meaning in existence, and the embedded existence in a moral universe. A moral universe is one that reveals God's signature and unveils the infinite good news that GOd plays an active role in the universe and the conditions of men. Thus a pre-Christian universe in Tolkein's vision, would be one in which God plays a major role upon the universal stage, much like the conception of the Universe established in the Old Testament as conceptualized by religious Jews. This world, expressed by St. Augustus, is one in which nothing is created evil, in fact evil is good that has been perverted. This world view also then brings up the issue of individual reponsibility which is thus seen not only as to one's own individual integrity but is a cosmic integrity. This responsibility is justified by the existence of some vast unnamed power for good. <br /> <br />Marion Bradley writes a compelling essay on the relationships embedded in the text, focusing on Merry and Pippin; Eowyn and Arwen; and ending with a superb analysis of the friendship between Frodo and Sam. <br /> <br />Verlyn Fleiger writes of the vast differences in heroic behavior between Aragorn and Frodo. Read this essay after reading the Auden essay since they deal with similar themes. <br /> <br />Patrick Grant does a superb job of interpreting Lord of the Rings from a Jungian perspective, acknowleding that the work can not be totally rendered or reduced into Jungian terms and concepts. Grant demonstrated both mastery of Jung and Tolkein and I felt Grant actually had enough concepts packed into one essay that he could have written a book. I especially liked the point that Frodo was on an inner quest of individuation and that certain characters were excellent examples of Jungian archtypes, such as Gollum as the Shadow; Galdriel as the Anima; Gandlaf as the Wise Old Man; Aragorn as the Heroic King; and Shelob as the dark Anima. Grant however also integrates Milton into the analysis and points out the theme of the Christian epic in which the true hero is on a spiritual quest, growing in faith and hope which is based on charity.  Grant also points out the realm of fairie is the realm of dream and myth where interior journeys through the psyche occur, stabilized by archetypal structures. Jung used the term 'enantidromia' to mean that evil leads to good. Grant points out that this concept resonates in Tolkein's work.  Jung saw man's quest as individuation, the realization of the whole man. Jung also realized that great darkness could arise from the psyche and that numinous, impressive, dangerous archetypes rise from the unconscious. Thus archtypical characters of good have a corresponding archetypal character of darkness; an example being the fellowship of the ring balanced by the Ringwraiths; or Gandalf by Saruman. <br /> <br />Tom Shippey is the final essay with a wonderful defense of the film trilogy with which I agree 100%.  <br /> <br />Some themes flowed throughout the essays. These included the quest of the hero, the moral universe, and linking Lord of the Rings to historic facts and forces.  Whereas all the authors related that Tolkein hated allegory, there were certainly linkages bwteeen Mordor and the blight of the industrial revolution as well as Tolkein's experiences in World War I and the gloom of Nazism and Communism. <br /> <br />Several essayist quoted the wonderful timeless lines when Frodo says: I wish it need not have happened in my time, to which Gandalf says \\"So do I...and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide.\\"  <br /> <br />Very well written and clear, these essays offered comprehensive interpretations of Tolkein's great work.	2005-10-01
US	35501691	RI7LEIDPNXK0P	0743222954	337618584	At Swim, Two Boys: A Novel	Books	5	10	10	N	Y	Exceptional in many many ways	If there was any way I could give this exceptional novel 10 stars, I certainly would. To say it is 'exceptional' is to understate the power of Jamie O'Neill's labor of love. Whereas anyone would find the novel to be superb, I think gay men would especially identify with the struggle for identity in a society that represses that identity. In this regard the book resonates with E.M. Forrester's Maurice and with Maria McCann's As Meat Loves Salt.  <br /> <br />Many reviewers have discussed the touching and tragic love affair between \\"Doyler\\" Doyle and Jim Mack, bright 17 year old boys who have known each other all their lives. Thus a touching coming of age story is embedded in the larger text.  <br /> <br />Other reviewers have discussed the wonderful play of comedy and tragedy in the book. Mr. Mack and Madame Evaline MacMurrough certainly display the human comedy all to well. Yet, no one is a clown in this novel. O'Neill's gift is that he draws each character with respect and justice, a feature Iris Murdoch says is essential for the novelist. Somewhat foolish characters, such as Mr. Mack, grow and emerge as heroic. <br /> <br />Other reviewers select to analyze Anthony MacMurrough, the wounded intellectual young man who initiates sex with Doyler Doyle and plays somewhat of a Oscar Wilde character in the novel. There is much to discuss in this character who comes from Irish gentry but spends two years in prison in London for trying to pick up a serving man for a sexual encounter. He is beaten in the beginning of the novel, even his personality has become fractured and disjointed. He appears to prey on young men. But as the novel progresses, he becomes somewhat of a protector and social anchor for the romance of two young men, protecting their love because he knows society will reject it.  <br /> <br />I would rather discuss the theme of identity that O'Neill masterfully explores in this novel. However, I can't resist commenting on the resiliency of Doyler Doyle. <br /><br />First, the novel is about the nature of repressed identity and the consequences of that repression. This is so perfectly drawn as O'Neill compares the way that homosexual identity was repressed with severe criminal sanctions and he compares this to the Irish identity, again an identity that was repressed by the British.  However, homosexuals and Irishmen both practice self-repression to avoid conflict and survive. O'Neill's brillance is showing the comparison between the emergence of gay identity in his young characters simultaneously to the emergence of Irish identify in these and other characters. Madame Evaline MacMurrough chastizes her gay nephew for his homosexuality, which she wishes he would keep hidden, yet she boldly encourages his emergence as an Irish radical and his acceptance of his Irish identity. It is a sign of MacMurrough's strength that he emerges from the tragic end with realistic hope alive. <br /> <br />Second, the novel is not only about repressed identity but also fluid identity. The names of the characters in the novel change over time as the reader becomes more intimate with these characters. All the characters change and grow, which was an act of masterful orchestration by O'Neill. Madame MacMurrough and Mr. Mack become much more radicalized for the cause of Ireland while Jim Mack struggles with his sexual desires and his strict Catholic beliefs. Anthony MacMurrough changes from a defeated intellectual to a man who shares his strengths and protects the love of two boys. <br /> <br />Third, the novel reflected the complexities of human relationships. The ancient grudge between Mr. Mack and Mr. Doyle has festered until Mr. Mack breaks the deadlock while Mr. Doyle is dying of TB. Another example is when Mr. Mack's oldest son, Gordon, dies in Turkey during World War I leaving a pregnant serving girl behind. Aunt Sawney in her old wisdom refuses to allow this girl to be driven homeless out of town and moves her into the Mack home. The relationships between Doyler Doyle, Anthony MacMurrough, and Jim Mack are the most complex moving from sexual encounters and attraction to mentoring and romance. <br /> <br />Fourth, the novel has one of the most resilient characters in English literature in Doyler. He is a bright verbal fearless energetic young man raised in abject poverty with an alcoholic father and washer-woman mother. He displays appropriate pride and humility throughout and can not help but to become a character that readers come to love. He refuses to be defeated. When the Catholic Priest throws him out of hte boys band when he finds Doyler has a socialist pin, he emerges victorious and more experienced. When he is seduced by Anthony MacMurrough, he grows from being rough trade to full gay identity, never falling into the role of victim. <br /> <br />Fifth, the novel firmly establishes the historical grounding that assists us all in identity development. Whether this is the Gaelic language and history that Doyler has learned, or the gay identity that MacMurrough has found in historical context, that identity is dependent on social structure is perfectly displayed in the growth of these characters. <br /> <br />I always want to be challenged by excellent literature and this wonderful novel hits the mark!	2005-09-25
US	35501691	R1ZMGL24YUQANV	0312275420	697393202	Being Dead: A Novel	Books	4	2	2	N	Y	A view of death that is natural and realistic	This is certainly a well written, calm, thoughtful, dispassionate book. I found several aspects of the book thought provoking: <br /> <br />First, Jim Crace spends much more time and effort in this book viewing the interiors of the two female characters, Celice and her daughter Syl.  In some ways the mother and daughter were much alike and Crace focuses most of his attention on Celice when she is a young biology graduate student, which is around the age of Syl when her two parents are murdered. He seems fascinated withh the ways women manipulate and seduce men. He also is very conscioius of the way men seduce women, as exemplified by Joseph's use of singing to seduce Celice as well as the mortuary assistant and the taxi drivers attempts to seduce Syl.  <br /> <br />Second, Crace does not take us on a wild romp to bring justice to the faceless man that kills Joseph and Celice in the dunes by the bay. He takes a more dispassionate perspective of balance in nature rather than justice in human social networks. The murderer kills them and drives off in their car. We really don't hear from him again. But we do get a full description of the way their bodies decompose and begin the natural process of returning to the earth. <br /> <br />Third, whenever there is sex in the book, there is death. Joseph and Celice first make love while a fellow graduate student burns to death in the ocean cabin. Syl and Geo the taxi driver make love while she awaits news of her parent's dissappearance. Joseph and Celice try to make love in the dunes many years later and meet the murderer. Where there is death, there is new life is the mirror image of where there is new life, there begins death. In many ways this could be said to be one of the main themes of novel.  <br /> <br />Fourth, the writing style is masterful with events from past and present very carfully woven together until they converge.  <br /> <br />The book is short and can easily be finished in a couple of nights of reading before bed. Even though the subject is death, you will not have disturbed slumber, I promise you.	2005-09-17
US	35501691	R3COBJDJZZYV77	0743223136	747139631	John Adams	Books	5	3	3	N	N	First rate book from first to last page.	This book is excellent. It covers an incredible period in our history, especially focusing on teh period around 1760 to around 1810. Adams played a major role in the Continental Congress, the development of the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution, the alliance with France and Holland during the Revolutionary War, the Washington Presidency, and of course the Adams Presidency. <br /> <br />The historic characters come alive in this book, especially Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Pitt, Benjamin Franklin, Benjamin Rush, Alexander Hamilton, Aaron Burr, George III, John Marshall, John Jay, Patrick Henry, Thomas Paine, and especially Abigail Adams. <br /> <br />Adams was a very bright man, sometimes too stubborne and confrontive which made him some enemies, but extremely solid. We owe him a debt of gratitude for his sacrafices and commitment to the creation of the United States. This nation today operates on concepts that Adams integrated into our constitution and inacted during his Presidency. <br /> <br />The book is long, but very readable and entertaining. The Adams family corresponded during long periods of absence and the sacrifices they made resulted in an amazing chronicle of the early years of our nation. <br /> <br />First class literature, you will not be disappointed.	2005-09-09
US	35501691	RWXJU5VSE3584	0679735739	741679065	The Information	Books	3	5	10	N	N	Under all the sophistication is a simple morality play	After reading all the other reviews of this novel, I find that my take on the novel was somewhat different than many of the other reviewers. I gave the novel a \\"3\\" primarily because I found the British street talk of the criminals to be too full of slang for me to follow closely.   <br /> <br />I will agree that Martin Amis is a master of the English language, full of dark irony and humor. His depiction of the literary world of Great Britian and the United States was caustic. He is razor sharpe in his knowledge of the ambiguous and competitive nature of friendship. The book seemed so very contemporary and yet I felt that under it all was the basic strucuture of an early Christian morality play. <br /> <br />I found that for me, despite the jumping bck and forth in time, the story's basic armature was a morality play, a story of how envy gradually destroys the soul. I was no Richard Tull fan. He is not likeable. He ignores his wife and child, he drinks, he is insensitive to others, arrogant and pretentious. Yet he is envious of his friend, Gwyn Barry, who has become a best selling author with a utopian brainless document with appeal for the masses. Yet Richard continues to plot devious and increasingly alarming plots against Gwyn and his family that backfire and are soon out of control.  Richard reminded me of the idiotic used car salesman in the film Fargo, who hires criminals to kidnap his wife so as to shake down her father so as to pay off some debt. The fool does not even comprehend the nature of Evil and its total disregard for humanity. Whenever Evil is used as a tool by one human against another, its power is let lose and demonstrates that it is beyond human control. Moreover, as in the case of Richard Tull, the evil backfires and begins to destroy him who let it lose in the first place. The street thugs of London become devils from the depths of Hell. In this regard I found the book to be a morality play with moral lessons embedded in layers upon layers of sophisticated dark wry humor. <br /> <br />I appreciated Martin Amis' story of how envy, like a cancer, eats away at the soul. Those who chose to confront envy with some painful introspection may have sidestepped evil. Those who indulge envy can expect Evil to soon join them on their path. Evil is not an attractive partner for one's life journey as this novel so thoughtfully demonstrates.	2005-09-04
US	35501691	R3FCB86XBL37B1	1594480001	659516630	The Kite Runner	Books	4	4	8	N	Y	Intersting but a bit too structured	This book offers a unique fresh look into the lives of the Islamic people of Afghanistan. There are four aspects of the novel that I would like to point out.  <br /> <br />First, the novel is built around interpersonal conflicts nested against the political turmoil of Afghanistan, which in many ways reflects and parallels the turmoil in the lives of the characters. We see Amir and his father, the priviledged wealthy Sunni family, contrasted with Ali and Hussain, the poor servant Shi Hazzara family. We see the fall of the monarchy, the feeble attempts at establishment of a republic, a civil war, and the rise of the Taliban from the ashes of the civil war. The lives of all the characters are greatly impacted not only by their personal relationships but also the major political changes happening in the country. This is the great theme of Tolstoy's War and Peace where war is the ever present background that impacts interpersonal relationships and personal decisions.  <br /> <br />Second, the plot twists are integrated with the cultural and religious aspects of the community. The Shi Hazzara are an underclass and thus are treated cruely and kept in indentured slavery. Ali's father has an illegitimate son, Hussain, with a Shi Hazzara woman, and whereas he seesm to love and be proud of Hussain, he does not allow Hussain to go to school or rise above the level of a simple house-boy.Throughout the book, the culture of Islam in Afghanistan directs many very personal decisions and relationships. <br /> <br />Third, the story is highly structured. Hosseini carefully wrote this book so that parallel actions and patterns arise. There are so many of these structured contrasts that they dominate the book in many ways. For example the evil half German boy who loves Hitler rapes Hussain and then later sodomizes his orphaned son. Both Ali and Hussain lose their mothers immediately after they are born. The household is composed of a servant man and his son and a master and his son.Thomas Hardy, the English novelist, also wrote these type novels where for every action there is a reaction, for every pattern there is a corresponding similar pattern revealed elsewhere in the book.  Structured novels create injustices which are addressed in the end to make the reader feel good, with the belief that there is justice in the universe. Structered novels create characters and situations that must be pulled together and addressed in the end so that the reader does not have any lingering questions or concerns or sense of uneasiness. Hosseini writes a very structured novel here that ensures final justice and resolution so the reader can finish the last page and go into undisturbed sleep, thinking that the cosmic balance of justice has been restored. <br /> <br />Fourth, the story follows the age old path of the fall from innocense to the earned redemption for sin. Amir and Hussain are in Eden in their youth, playing together, eating fruit from the orchard.  The realities of class and history begin to emerge but it is envy that eventually disrupts this relationships. Amir envies Hussain, fails to defend Hussain while he is being raped, and then arranges that Hussain and his father be sent into exile from the family employment because Amir can not face his guilt. However the novel allows Amir the opportunity for redemption and to address the fall from Eden. He can't save Hussain, who is killed by the Taliban, but he can save his young 4 year old son. The journey from California, to Pakistan, to Afghanistan's orphanages and the trials and tribulations Amir undergoes is the redemption and the restitution he pays to regain his innocense, symbolized by the innocent little son of Hussain. <br /> <br />The reason I did not give the book a \\"5\\" is that it was too structured for me. It was too coincidental and the ending was too neatly pulled together for me. I apppreciate lose ends and untidy endings and Hosseini decided to not to leave any lose characters or plot issue unresolved. I wish life had such a way of resolving lose ends, but in reality it doesn't. Thus Hosseini's interesting book becomes more of a myth or morality fable than a reflection on reality.	2005-08-27
US	35501691	R1K1IYOB9D24V0	157687169X	336422846	Foro Italico	Books	4	4	5	N	Y	Giant male beauties from another time and place	George Mott's 1982 photographs of some of the most beautiful of the male athletic statues that surround the Foro Italico is the subject of this book.  Mussolini, attempting to glorify the althetic male body in his Stadium of Statues, was disappointed that the 1944 Olympics in Rome were cancelled because of World War II. Yet the stadium and these 12 foot marble statues remain and are captured well by Mott's black and white presentation. <br /> <br />The core of the book is 32 photographs of these graceful statues of athletic men. The Boxer is certainly one of the most impressive and is featured not only on the book cover but by two photographs inside the book showing the statue of heayweight champion Primo Carnera from two views. The Diver is of a youth that looks like an image from classical antiquity. Hercules is shown twice, once as the discus thrower and then again with the head of the defeated lion covering the back of his head and shoulders.  The Boxer donated by Mantova is a strong work of art, showing the expanded brow and broken nose of a powerful and confident man. The Bare Fisted Boxer by Bellini also is a work of masculine power with the characteristic expanded brow and broken nose, adding to the masculine attraction rather than distracting. The Soccer Player by Morescalchi again evokes the sublime youth of classical antiquity. <br /> <br />If someone was purchasing this book purely for male erotica, I would think they will be disappointed.  The figures of young male athelets in the prime of their youth and power are certainly compelling, but the statues are of unequal appeal and Mott selects only half for this book. The images are of marble statues and whereas the bodies are stunning, they are also stylized in a manner later seen in Soviet social realism. However, in 4 or 5 images, the essence of male beauty is captured in these marble giants in powerful almost architypal simplicity and grace.	2005-08-21
US	35501691	R23I1Y5WWBRGDX	0300087012	453970176	Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave Written By Himself	Books	5	7	7	N	N	This should be required reading for every student	As you read Frederick Douglass' \\"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave\\" it is almost impossible to ignore that this man was not only brilliant but also had a warm wise heart.<br /><br />Some have said that this book is the most influential African-American book and I would have to agree that it surely is one of the top. There are many strengths to the book and I will mention a few:<br /><br />First, this is a first hand account of the practice of slavery from the perspective of the slave.  Slavery was defended as a humane practice by the wealthy Southern upperclass and it takes first hand testimony, such as this book, to reveal the evils of slavery.  Slavery was defended on the grounds that Negroes were intellectually inferior to Whites. The crisp beautiful writing of Douglass immediately calls this concept into question. Thus this book is testimony to the intellectual power of the writer and calls into question racist concepts around intellectual inferiority.  Douglass identifies the incredible hypocracy of White Christians who worshiped God on Sunday and beat their slaves when they came home. Slaves were malnourished while White slave owners said grace over their fine tables of meat and vegetables. Many Whites claimed the Bible supported slavery by quoting the scripture: \\"He that knoweth his master's will, and doeth it not, shall be beaten with many stripes.\\" (Luke 12:47) Douglass found that religious slaveholders were the most cruel. Slavery was sometimes defended as humane with the weak argument that since slaves were property that the slave owners would not hurt them and thus damage their property. How many of us have seen a young person destroy a car through wreckless disregard?  The truth is that we don't really take care of our property and power over another person creates the potential for cruelty. Slaveholders were not held responsible for murdering or mutilating their slaves. In our current day and age this seems unbelievable but 140 years ago it was true. Because of his intelligence and determination, the young 16 year old Douglass was sent to a \\"slave breaker\\".  These were lower class White farmers who were willing to manage an unruly slave for a period of time and then return them to the upperclass White plantation owner after they had been beaten and suppressed into submission. These sadistic poor White farmers could never afford a slave unless they obtained one on a temporary basis for purposes of \\"breaking\\" the spirit of the slave. This sadistic treatment did not break Douglass but strengthened his resolve and determination. The use of slave-breakers or sell of unruly slaves was common practice. Douglass reports that when asked slaves must report their masters as \\"kind\\" so to avoid beatings, sale to a slave-breaker, or loss and breakup of their slave family.<br /><br />Second, Douglass's sharp mind recognized the structural supports for slavery and the potential structural supports to change the inferior position of Negroes. He realized that priviledge and opportuntity were paramount to development for the Negro community.Throughout this review I will use the term \\"Negro\\" as compared to \\"African American\\" in an effort to keep this review consistent with the sense of time, place, and actual narrative of Douglass's book. Douglass does not use the more contemporary term \\"African American\\" in his text. Douglass recognized that it was in the best interests of the slave-owner to keep the slaves ignorant. He points out that slaves did not even know thier own age.  Further, Douglass recognized that by not honoring family relationships for Negroes, weakened their social structure and allowed adolescent slaves to be traded or given away, never to be seen again by their parents. His pain is evident when he tells of his grandmother who saw many children and grandchildren sold with no information on where they were going or any information about whether the lived or died.

It is very comprehensive, covering all major aspects of the life of this amazing character who was our 6th President. Jackson's life and adventures are so amazing that most folks would think these facts were fiction. A short account of some of these wild adventures follows: <br /> <br />Jackson's family immigrated to the American colonies and settled in the South Carolina colony. Andrew's mother gave birth to Andrew almost immediately after her husband's funeral.  <br /> <br />As a young man he was willful and wild with an angry streak. He was very tall, very thin, and never weighed more than 145 pounds in his entire life. <br /> <br />In his early teens,he became a messenger boy for the revolutionary troops. He was captured and ordered to shine the boots of a British officer. When he refused and demanded to be treated as a prisoner of war, the officer struck him wiht a sword gashing his head and his fingers that had instinctually gone to his face to protect himself when he saw the officer raise his sword.  This incident resulted in a man who despised the British from that day forth. Andrews brother was also captured and the boys were separated, robbed, and exposed to smallpox.  Andrew's mother actually came forward to negotiate the release of her sons from the prisoner of war lock-up. Unfortunately both became ill with small pox and Robert died but Andrew survived. His mother, unfortunately, while tending to ill cousins in Charleston, contracted cholera and died.  <br /> <br />Andrew was self educated initially, studying law books. He also became the leader of a gang of hooligans. Eventually, with the support of his cousins,he was able to take and pass the bar examination and became a lawyer. As a wandering spirit, he left for the wilds of Tennessee, an area that was not yet a state.  <br /> <br />Jackson settled in the area that became Nashville and there met young Rachel Donelson Robards.Jackson lived in her mother's boarding house and Rachel finding herself in a disasterous marriage came home to live with her mother. Rachel was too young to marry and Robards was an angry alcoholic.  <br /> <br />Robards, trying to get his young wife back, named Jackson as a possible sexual laison. Jackson threatened to cut his ears off. Robards eventually thought he had evidence against Jackson and Rachel and sued for divorce in Virginia on the grounds of adultery and desertion. However he did not really have a divorce, but had an enabling act that would allow him to sue. Jackson assumed the divorce was legal and never reviewed any documenting paper work. Both Jackson and Rachel claim they then married but no evidence of such a marriage exists. Then two years later all parties became aware of the truth and Robards did successfully sue for divorce on the grounds of adultery and Jackson and Rachel obtained a 'second' marriage license. This chain of incidents would later produce a great scandal in the Jackson White House and much pain for the Jackson's.  <br /> <br />Jackson handled multiple cases as a young lawyer, traveling between Tennessee towns through Indian territories. Jackson was aware that the new United States was surrounded by territories belonging to France, Spain, and Great Britian and that expansion would require ruffling feathers of the great European nations. Jackson joined the Tennessee militia.  <br /> <br />Jackson is a controverial figure, especilly around his career as an Indian fighter. He assisted in gettng Tennessee accepted into the Union as the 16th state during the Presidency of Washington. Jackson was elected to Congress, at age 29, to represent Tennessee, the only representaitve, and waged a campaign for assistance dealing with Native Indians that were in conflict with White settlers. Jackson saw that land was the surest means of obtaining power and wealth. He was disappointed by Congress,even though he also served as a Senator, but wished a military career so he ran for Major General of the Tennessee Militia. Jackson's wild reputation grew and even Thomas Jefferson was amazed at the brash young man critical of the Adams Presidency. He became known for anger and lack of articulation and eventually resigned from the Senate. He then became Tennessee's superior judge at age 30. He was amazingly swift, hearing 50 cases in 15 days. He was elected Major General as he wished, which opened the doors for national heroism. <br /> <br />During this time the Louisiana purchase occured. Jackson built his plantation home, the Hermitage. He was a slave owner known to have little mercy for a runaway slave. Around this time, Jackson had a gun fight with a young fellow named Dickinson. Jackson killed Dickinson and Dickinson wounded Jackson with a bullet that remained next to Jackson's heart all his life, causing him pain and discomfort. After Aaron Burr killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel, he developed a friendship with Jackson. Burr began to involve him in a plan to dismember the Union and Jackson to his credit, did not take the bait, and revealed to President Jefferson his small knowledge of the plot. <br /> <br />Though Jackson and his wife were unable to have children of their own, they adopted Rachel's brother's child when the twin was 3 days old. Of course this did not stop a bar room gun fight with Thomas Hart Benton, a man with whom he would later serve in Congress. <br /> <br />His next adventures occurred in the Alabama territory during the civil war of the Creek nation. Jackson took advantage of the civil war among the Creeks, winning the battle of Horseshoe Bend, and eventually winning 75% of the state of Alabama for the Union and greatly reducing Creek territory. Jackson defeated the Indian nations of the Southest and took Florida from Spain in the battle of Pensacola. Jackson's troops were reported to be in Mobile so the British invaded New Orleans in the new war of 1812. The British burned the White House, forcing President Madison to leave the city. Jackson was assisted by the Pirate LaFitte in defending New Orleans from superior British forces. This lead to his nickname, \\"Old Hickory\\". Jackson's forces defeated the British and only later was it revealed that the War of 1812 had actually ended weeks earlier with a treaty signed in Belgium.  <br /> <br />Jackson was no friend to the American Indians, the Creeks, Chicasaws, Chocktaws,Cherokees and others were defeated and forced to leave their ancestral lands. This lead to the nickname of Jackson by the Indians, \\"Sharp Knife\\". Eventually the Native peoples were driven from the Mississippi territory and when Mississippi became a state, their capital was named after Jackson. <br /> <br />After defeat of these Indians, Jackson defeated the Seminoles in Florida, forcing them to hide in the Everglades and claiming Florida for the United States. Missouri and Maine entered the Union and President Monroe asked Jackson to serve as the first military governor of the Florida territory. <br /> <br />After serving in this position Jackson began a rise to national leadership.  However instead of Indians, now he did battle with the Banks that served east coast financial and industrial interests and did not offer enough support for western expansion, in the opinion of Jackson. Jackson and John Quincy Adams fought a nasty campaign that ended in a tie which was broken by his old enemy Clay in favor of Adams. This became a national scandal considering that Jackson was a national hero and actually won the popular vote. However 4 years later Jackson defeated Adams and won the Presidency. During these dirty campaigns, the details of the Jackson's marriage came out, causing Rachel much pain. She died soon after her husband was elected and he grieved her loss until the day he died. <br /> <br />At this point you are only half way through this amazing book about an amazing and unique character. I can not agree with many of Jackson's actions and policies, especially around treatment of the Native Americans. However he was one of the most fascinating personalties in all US history. Remini captures this in wonderful detail, always writing fairly and in a balanced manner regarding a controversial national figure. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-08-20

This practice was dehumanizing and should be identified as the horrible practice that it is.<br /><br />Jacobs tells us that one of the most painful aspects of slavery was the way slave families could be sold and parents would never know where their adolescent children had been sold as slaves. The needs of the White slave owners came first and the sick children of slaves had to be left alone to tend to field labor and domestic chores in the Plantation home. Jacobs points out that White women were hardened to the cries of Negro workers when their children were sold away.<br /><br />Jacobs also tells us of the beatings that slave workers often received from their masters. Jacobs admits that sex between masters and slaves was not uncommon and that children born with white fathers and black mothers were cruely treated by the master's wife and were usually some of the first children sold off the plantation.<br /><br />Harriet Jacobs thinks that White slave owners introduced Christianity to the Negro slaves so that they could be taught not to murder their White masters. Christianity turned out to be a philosophical and spiritual gift to the Negro slaves who lost their culture when they were shipped from Africa. Slaves soon learned that the Christianity practiced by White slave owners allowed for murder, beating, and all forms of degradation and shame to the slaves justified by Biblical Scripture. The slaves had to learn how to take from Christianity a spiritual gift to give them strength while recognizing that White Christians used the Bible to justify their violence.<br /><br />She quotes from the wonderful old spiritual song: \\"Ole Satan's church is here below; Up to God's free church I hope to go.\\"<br /><br />Books such as this reveal the false claim that the Negro race is inherently inferior and thus requires the White race to dominate. Jacobs had to hide her intelligence or risk possible beating and isolation.<br /><br />The book tells a story of her life and her escape from slavery after being hidden if a secret compartment within a house for many years. Slave narratives such as this give first hand testimony to the cruelty of slavery and the false beliefs that perpetuated it for hundreds of years.e beating and isolation. <br /> <br />The book tells a story of her life and her escape from slavery after being hidden if a secret compartment within a house for many years.

When Antinous, around age 20, was accidentally drowned on the Nile, the 54 year old Hadrian was devasted and his grief changed the Empire.  There is some evidence to indicate that Hadrian and Antinous had a 9 year acquatance before Antinous' death. We are unsure if the relationship was sexual in the beginning when Antinous was a child of 11. Other evidence would indicate that he gradually rose to prominence in the Imperial household and became the lover of the Emperor in the final two years of his short life. There are some descriptions of the couple that would indicate Antinous's maturity beyond his years and his calming wise personality brought relief to the restless personality of Hadrian. There is also some evidence that they shared spiritual beliefs and together joined a mystery cult. Hadrian established a cult around Antinous that spread throughout the Mediterranean. There were at least 40 cities with evidence of worship and cults to this state sponsored god. There is some evidence that the cult of Antinous and the cults of Dionysos and Hermes are overlapping since both were named the gods of farm animals, fertility and crops. Sculptors created statues of male adolescent beauty in honor of Antinous, which established the canon of adolescent perfection for many years in the classical world.  <br /> <br />Hadrian was an amazing fellow. In his later years he lived at Tivoli in a fantasy village containing replicas of the great landmarks of the empire. He was surrounded by multiple images of his deceased lover. <br /> <br />There is some belief that Antinous was a human sacrifice of some kind to appease the gods or to benefit Hadrian. Handrian himself denied this to be true in his later years. Others believe he was a slave boy.  This is certainly false since Rome was built on slave labor and to raise a slave to god status would have been totally beyond the economic and class structures of Rome. Reports that Antinous was a castrated eunich are also to be questioned since the statues all indicate fully developed muscular male beauty and Hadrian outlawed castration of slaves. Some records indicate Hadrian wrote erotic poetry to Antinous but none survives. <br /> <br />Also remember that the cult of Antinous was a competitor with early Christianity. With very few exceptions, writing about the relationship between Antinous and Hadrian are not homophobic with the exception of early Christian writings which were scandalized by the religious cult established by the Emperor in honor of his lover. The festivities around the cult of Antinous supposedly endorsed homosexual orgies. This book is very well researched and documented and certianly is broad reaching and thorough. I would suggest however Marguerite Yourcenar's Memoirs of Hadrian as a companion book. Hadrian become Emperor at 41, mature and wise to the ways of worldly power. He beame emperor after his Spanish cousin, Trajan, a major character in Yourcenar's Memoirs. Trajan, a childless but happily married man, never showed favoritism to Hadrian and never acknowledged him as his successor. This may have save Hadrian's life and character since he was supposed not favored above others in his military career. his political skills increased as the speech writer for his cousin Trajan. Hadrian quickly consolidated power when Trajan died of a stroke in Syria. He wore a short beard, the first of the Emperors to do so but a style followed by all the others. Twice assassination attempts were made on his life. Hadrian ws known for never forgetting the names of men who served with him in the military and was known tobathe and eat alongside common soldiers.  There was never a hint of a military takeover during his reign.  <br /> <br />Much like Elizabeth I, he kept his own council, never really trusting those around him. He married Sabina but all indications would indicate this was a marriage of convenience. He respected the Senators but retained the lion's share of power.  <br /> <br />Hadrian was known for his many state trips and spent half of his reign outside of Rome. Of the 44 provinces making up the Empire, he visited 38. He died at age 62 atter ruling Rome for 21 years. Lambert has written a good book, speculating sometimes but sticking to the skimpy facts most of the time. The nature of this Imperial homosexual relationship remains a mystery in many ways.  The fact that a gay Emperor ruled Rome at the height of power and world dominance, was able to establish a religious cult to his beautiful young deceased lover, and have very little negatively reflected in the surviving texts is testimony that homophobia need not always infect a society.	2005-08-19

Other reviewers have discussed how realistically this novel portrays addition to opiates. I agree totally. The wild life of searching for drugs, using drugs, recovering from the drugs and then recycling back into the search for drugs is perfectly described. <br /> <br />There are two themes in the book however that are of high interest. The first is the way time, both short term and long term, is changed and distorted by addiction. Davies does a very good job of showing life melting away, year after year, with no accomplishments or benchmarkes when a person is addicted to opiates. <br /> <br />The second theme, which is actually the theme of the entire book, is that opiates kill psychological pain. Why were these young lovers so amazingly drug hungry?  Gradually we come to understand that Candy's extremely high anxiety over never meeting her mother's expectations has turned her into a clock that has been wound too tight. Opiates dissolve her anxiety, her anger, her painful memories. Likewise, the narrarator also has the pain of the lose of his core family with the death of his mother and his father's abandonment of parental responsibility.  There is a reason someone is drug hungry, and this reason perpetuates the addiction. Those reasons emerge like angry ghosts when the drugs are withdrawn because they have festered and boiled while left alone in the soul. <br /> <br />Candy dissolves in this story. She moves from young actress to call girl and then she loses her mind. We never really know her when she is addicted. We know about her genitals and her sexual habits, but we never really know her until the drugs start to dry up and the angry little girl inside Candy emerges along with her drug craving. We don't know her until she is under pressure and then we see her gradually fall apart. <br /> <br />I was entertained by all the drug chasing and sexual adventures but in the end this is a very sad story. A story about how humans will seek oblivion rather than experience pain. I am not judging, maybe some day I will be in great psychological or physical pain and I will also seek oblivion, the nothing, timelessness.	2005-08-10
US	35501691	RAFNSI05OL51P	0743250419	372341668	The Master: A Novel	Books	4	7	8	N	N	It is a mistake not to fully live your life	This well written book on Henry James does a super job of linking events in the life of James with his novels and short stories without making overt connections, everything is implicit, much like the work of the master writer himself. <br /> <br />There are five themes explored in the book that are worthy of exploration. <br /> <br />First, James' sexual orientation and behavior remains a mystery and Toibin certainly delicately and carefully explores this area. James befriended wealthy, intelligent women and thus it is no surprise that they sensed that Henry James was attracted to men and yet was unable to act upon that attraction. Lady Wolseley, wife of the military governor of Ireland, trys to match-make with James and a handsome, bright, sensitive army officer, yet James never makes the right move.   <br /> <br />Second, James thoughtfully translated and transformed the people in his life into the characters in his novels. His bright terminally ill sister Alice inspires \\"Daisy Miller\\". His witty verbal intelligent cousin Minny Temple inspires Isabel Archer in \\"Portrait of a Lady\\".  <br /> <br />Third, the sections on the Civil War wounded and the military career and wounding of Wiley James were beautifully written and fully capture not only James' unwillingness to engage life but his guilt at not engage it. <br /> <br />Fourth, Henry was a second child, following behind his brilliant brother, William, the father of American Psychology. William offers interesting dialogue regarding his findings from \\"The Varieties of Religious Experience\\".  Yet it is the relationship between the brothers, the competition and the challenges to each other's sensibility that Toibin captures very well. <br /> <br />Fifth, some of the most moving parts of the book relate the friendship of Henry to Constance Fenimore Woolson, a novelist who commits suicide in Venice in despair over the never deeloping relationship between Henry and Constance. These painful events eventually show up in \\"The Beast in the Jungle\\", one of the greatest short stories ever written. This story is the account of a life never lived, a missed life, a tragedy of non-occurance. Henry recognized that he and Constance were of such matching temprements that they would have made wonderful companions, yet his 'secret' keeps him from moving toward the bright, sensitive, women who would have loved him despite his 'secret'. <br /> <br />So what does one think about Henry James after reading this novel?  He was the outsider, the observer, the one who withdrew from confrontation, from relationships, from sexual gratification, and some may think that this lead to his genius and wonderful gifts to world literature. I am not of this school. If James has given us some of the finest novels in the English language from the perspective of the observer, the non-participant, then how much more could he have given us if he had fully lived his life?  As the book so clearly states, it is a mistake not to fully live your life.	2005-08-07

Late republic Rome was full of power struggles, class warfare, social injustice, and politcal systems that failed to govern - leading to frustration, riots, and the rise of dictators. <br /> <br />I found that this book had three strengths that should be mentioned. First, the book explores the nature of political power and the governmental forms that held republic Rome together and informed the founding fathers of the United States. Second, the nature of political power is illustrated with the rise of Caesar and the cast of characters that succeed him. Third, the influence of Cicero as politician and writer are explored.  I will go into more detail below. <br /> <br />First, this book on Cicero does a very good job of explaining the fragile balance of power that had developed in late Republican Rome. Cicero, ever the rationalist, sees that a balance of power between monarchy, oligarchy, and democracy was necessary to avoid the dominance of one group over another. Of course his perspective is swayed by his own class, the Senatorial class, but he was not born to the great families of Rome and thus his perspective is sometimes that of the outsider. Cicero recognized that the classes had differing interests in government and thus by allowing compromise, the classes remained stable. Of course, the class structure lay above a vast world of slave labor. When the system of checks and balances allows for stagnation of government and locked special interests, only crisis allows opportunity to break the deadlocks. Unfortunately, in ancient Rome, this often meant the rise of a dictator. <br /> <br />Second, the career of Caesar is intertwined with that of Cicero and must be explored together. Cicero, as a young Senator, saw the rise of the dictator Sulla and learned many lessons on power consolidation. These were lessons put to use in the dual rise of Caesar and Pompey for control ofRome. Caesar made so many right moves, he was a natural politician much like Lyndon Johnson or Bill Clinton. Pompey on the other hand was an able administrator without the spark of political genius at the right time at the right place, which costs him his life. Caesar is followed by Mark Anthony, Brutus, Octavian Caesar, Cleopatra and a raft of other political characters trying to divide up Caesar's empire or rule it all. <br /> <br />Third, Cicero was a substantial actor on this stage, both as a politician and as a writer. Cicero plays a dangerous but essential game throughout his life. He not only believed in a balance of power in theory but he worked to maintain a balance of power in practice. He carefully moves from Caesar to Pompey and back again, supporting them when they appeared to be heading toward restoration of the republic and against them when they turned dictatorial. After the assassination of Caesar, he plays the same careful dangerous game with Brutus, Mark Anthony, and the amazing 18 year old Octavius Caesar. <br /> <br />In some ways Cicero was a wonderful example of moving political theory into practice, much like our second President, John Adams. Once grounded in the theory and its rational underpinnings, Cicero now has a base from which to conduct all interactions. Against the strong power hungry personalities of late republic Rome, he had to flip-flop, but he did so to survive for another act in the drama of political power.	2005-08-06

Carel's behavior throughout the book is destructive yet his apologist daughter, Muriel, keeps making excuses for him, even when she finds that her invalid cousin, Elizabeth, is actually her father's illegitimate daughter with his sister-in-law and he is having sex with this young sickly woman that he knows is his daughter.<br /><br />The parrish and parsonage are full of hidden passages and peep holes so that everyone can spy on Carel's misdeeds.<br /><br />His brother Marcus continues to make contact with Carel, continually is rebuffed, and then thinks he is enlightened by this process by the wise older brother, Carel, who actually could care less whether his younger brother lives or dies.<br /><br />Interestingly, there is a beautiful young amoral Russian boy, Leo, living in the parsonage with his father,who is just as amoral and is also forgiven because of his youth and beauty.

I found his opinions witty, entertaining, and sometimes profound. <br /> <br />He lists several reasons for reading in his first chapter and then identifies other reasons throughout the text. These include: reading is a healing pleasure; reading is a difficult pleasure since it is a search for the sublime; we read because we can't ever know enough people; we read to prepare ourselves for change; to strengthen our self and learn its authentic interests; we read in quest of minds more original than our own. <br /> <br />All of these reasons resonated with me. <br /> <br />Bloom identifies a range of talented poets and other writers and usually covers one work by each of his favorites. He defines talent as prolonged patience at seeing what others tend not to see.  <br /> <br />Bloom's virtual worship of William Shakespeare pops up in almost every essay. Bloom asserts that Shakespeare's strenghts comes from making no moral judgements about this characters but allows the reader of the play to make those assessments. Bloom considered Shakespeare to be the expert on intergenerational conflict. He quotes Borges who said that Shakespeare was \\"everyone and no one\\", meaning that his talent allowed him to reveal character without leaving any of his own finger prints.  <br /> <br />I liked Bloom's taxonomy of short stories into two camps; either they have narrative cohension based in reality such as Chekov, James, DeMaupassant, Hemingway, Nabokov or they are unreal fantasies freed from the narrative format such as Borges, Kafka, or Calvino. He illustrates his taxonomy by reviewing at least one work by each author, including a wonderful review of Calvino's Invisible Cities.  <br /> <br />Another section of the book covers his favorite poets including the wonderfully popular \\"Ulysses\\" by Tennyson, which is one of my favorites. I really liked his insights into Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson. He regards Dickinson as one of the most cognitive unique individuals in print and thus to understand her is a 'difficult pleasure'. <br /> <br />Bloom argues that Jane Austen was able, like Shakespeare, to \\"manifest sympathy to all her characters, no matter how detestable, while detaching herself even from her favorite.\\" He builds a case for \\"Emma\\" that I found convincing even though Elizabeth Bennett from \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is not only one of my favorite fictional characters, she is one of my favorite people. <br /> <br />Bloom's praise for Dicken's \\"Great Expectations\\" matched my own high regard for this novel. Whereas so much of Dicken can be characature, in \\"Great Expectations\\" the character development reached a new height and Estella's decision NOT to marry Pip remains one of the most understated character insights in English literature. She is an enigma but in this action or lack of action she reveals a depth of character beyond the emotional crippled creature that Miss Havisham tried to make of her. If she has been reared to be a man-destroying monster, what better way to seek her revenge on her \\"maker\\" than to marry a chauvanist monster and forsake the innocent boy who has loved her since childhood but whom she knew she would break. <br /> <br />Many novels are briefly reviewed but I especially liked his review of Nathaniel West's \\"Miss Lonelyhearts\\" and his superb analysis of Cormac McCarthy's \\"Blood Meridian\\". Judge Holden in this bloody saga is one of the most amazing characters in literature and Bloom defends this extremely violent novel with gusto.  <br /> <br />The longest essay in the work is on Hamlet, which is full of fresh insight into this majestic work. <br /> <br />Bloom covers 57 poems, short stories, plays, and novels in this 279 page book, thus giving each literary work around 4 to 5 pages of analysis. I found this to be just enough for Bloom to make his point and to stimulate my appetite to re-read many of these wonderful masterpieces.	2005-07-01

At my college, Basic Physics 101 was an introduction to the Newtonian approach to explaining the universe and Basic Physics 102 was an introduction to Quantum Mechanics. I think Gary Zukav's book would make a nice companion reading to the basic college text book on Quantum Mechanics. <br /> <br />The book is well written, relatively clear even when he is explaining highly complex and abstract concepts. However, every now and then Gary Zukav gets too speculatives and over interpretes.  <br /> <br />Whereas the book starts out with assetions that linkages would be made between Eastern mysticism and Quantum Mechanics, the book is basically 95% Quantum Mechanics and 5% Eastern mysticism and Gary Zukav does not always make convincing arguments as to how the two are tied together.	2005-06-25

There were exceptional aspects to this work; the development of the character of Judge Holden, the vast journey and adventure into meaningless chaos, and the superb writing skills of McCarthy. <br /> <br />First, the character of Judge Holden is a fascinating riddle. Judge Holden fiddles and dances nude. Is he Shiva, who dances on the skulls of mankind? Judge Holden appears to be a demi-god among lowly men, much like Hercules among the Argonauts (Harold Bloom's observation). He appears to be ageless and sleepless. When he speaks of war and mankind's tie to this blood ritual, he appears to be Ares, the Greek god of war. At other times he appears to be a dark avenging angel of God and at others the dark agent of the Devil. He is a dark anti-heroic character that speaks of mankind's need to fill the existential void of meaninglessness with a blood ritual, to flirt with the power of death, to bargain with death by sarifice of another victim. The Judge adopts a brain damaged idiot as his ape-like pet yet we feel that all ape-like mankind is the Judge's playground. There are few characters in literature that are as mysteriously and frighfully drawn as McCarthy develops the character of Judge Holden. He appears to be a human being but gradually as the story progresses he is revealed as something else, something very evil and yet something that exists in the hearts of men. Other characters are also well developed through their actions. Glanton, Brown, and Toadvine are born killers and they die by the sword. Jackson the Black is totally accepted into the group because he too is beyond remorse or compassion. There are two scenes where prejudicial statements are made about Jackson and the bigots are destroyed like bugs. Prejudice, bigotry, and sterotyping are more bound to social norms than is blood lust in this work and thus the murderers smash the bigot with the same glee that they would crush the country parson.  <br /> <br />Second, this is the classic journey novel, much like the Odessey or Jason and the Argonauts or Conrad's Heart of Darkness. A group of terrible killers work as scalp hunters, killing Indians of all tribes, genders, ages, and conditions in a blood-lust horror. Yet as they move from violent killing spree to horrid massacre, they dwindle in number and the protagonist, the Kid, reflects on the nature of this wild evil let loose on the world. The killing Glanton Gang is contrasted with village lowlife, very similar scum but with less imagination. Common villagers and settlers are no match for this senseless violence, primarily because they don't understand that it lacks both logic and compassion, therefore the plea for mercy is a joke, not a strategy for survival. <br /> <br />As the Glanton's move to victimize village after village, tribe after tribe, I became very disturbed by the missing children (both boys and girls) in each settlement. Then it begins to dawn on you who is killing these children. Finally, Judge Holden becomes totally blatant about keeping a 12 year old Mexican girl as a sex slave with a dog collar around her neck and food scraps in her food bowl. Judge Blanton calls the Kid his son on several occassions, however the Kid has grown to know the evil he now faces and he knows that to be the Judge's son is to be his rape and murder victim. <br /> <br />Third, this novel is beautifully written. The language ranges from poetic and archaic imagery to stark and economic descriptions of horror. The novel is full of words, rarely used in common language, that give the novel double meanings, mystery, and linkage to a mythological past. Whereas some critics link the novel to Melville and Faulkner, I found a common theme with Pat Barker's World War I Trilogy. This is especially true of the third book in the trilogy, The Ghost Road. In this novel the violence of World War I is seen as a blood ritual similar to the blood rituals of headhunters in New Guinea. Both Barker and McCarthy would seem to have us see war as blood ritual so that we can begin to understand the dark gods within ourselves whom we appease with sacrificial death. <br /> <br />Dark novels are good teachers.	2005-06-18
US	35501691	R2AH0LHTHQI60D	0156027321	843703088	Life of Pi	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Wonderful delightful reading	Life of Pi is super great! I needed some clever fun reading and Yann Martel's Life of Pi certain delivered an amusing reading experience. <br /> <br />The first part of the book, where a young Hindu boy becomes interested in both Christianity and Islam and begins to identify with all three religious traditions was wonderful. Pi found that the love of God integrated all the 'details' surrounding the three religions and he found all three to be full of truth, wisdom, and a route to God. Maybe the great religious experience of the modern era is that in which a person leaves the religion of their forefathers and takes a religious journey with another faith, learning new ways in which God is revealed, and then returns to their original faith with new exergy and expanded consciousness of the vast nature of God. John Donne in The Way of All Flesh explores this concept theologically in the same way that Martel explores this idea in fiction. <br /> <br />The story of the life on the lifeboat with the tiger and other animals was so well written that I could not put the book down.  <br /> <br />Finally, the resolution of the parable in the final pages is concise and razor sharp. We can chose to believe in God and experience God in our lives or we can chose not to believe. In the end, the lived daily human experience might be 'the better story' if we make the journey with God. <br /> <br />Bravo for a new classic.	2005-06-10
US	35501691	R3VL6TZSN48EXW	0375724818	696295159	The Golden Age: A Novel	Books	3	24	25	N	N	Not Vidal's best but interesting	I gave The Golden Age three stars primarily because the book had three tiresome flaws that kept it from achieving the excellence of his novel Lincoln. <br /> <br />The first weakness of this book is that Gore Vidal was far less subtle in controlling his own political philosophy in The Golden Age, possibly because the era in the novel was one in which Vidal lived, whereas in Lincoln, there was enough distance in time that Vidal was able to show more objectivity. For fans of Gore Vidal, of which I am one, his political philosophy is no secret. He believes that the Civil War allowed Lincoln to consolidate power into the presidency at the expense of the legislative branch. He thinks that we turned from the values of the republic and adopted the values of empire. During wartime, the power of the US President is heightened even further, thus becoming an incentive for a US President to declair war. He places both FDR and Truman into this category of expanding the power of the presidency through World War II and the Cold War. Vidal believes that the country has always been ruled by an wealthy elite group of citizens. As the technology of communication has evolved, this power seeking elite has learned how to control the media. The elite controlled first the printed press, then Hollywood in the 1930-1950s, and then television. Through mass media they shape the perceptions of the common American family. Vidal also believes that the Cold War and the search for Communism is also a strategy used by the powerful elite to evoke fear in the common family, thus keeping taxes high to pay wealthy defense and security contractors. <br /> <br />I actually also believe this to be true, however Gore Vidal is so heavy handed in The Golden Age that he ruins the novel by over emphasis of his political agenda.  I wished for the subtle interpersonal power plays that he depicts so well in Lincoln. <br /> <br />My second concern is his treatment of the historical characters. The historic characters in the novel are far more lively and multi-dimension as compared to the fictious characters, but their motives and actions are grossly bent to accomodate Vidal's political agenda. FDR's critical conversations take place \\"off stage\\" so that we only see him mixing martinis and engaged in witty commentary with his wife, Eleanor. Vidal seems to strongly believe that FDR knew about the Japanese intention to bomb Pearl Harbor prior to the bombing. I certainly believe this to be false and Vidal does not really make a strong case here in this novel at all of convincing me. He never gets into the head of FDR because in the end Vidal doesn't really have the goods to back up his outrageous claim. There are hundreds of historic characters in the novel and toward the end when he has Dawn Powell, Virgil Thompson, and Paul Bowles all delivering witty cocktail chatter, I realized the novel had melted into name dropping.  <br /> <br />My third concern is that there were far too many cardboard one dimensional fictitious characters who all sounded just alike in their witty, upperclass sarcasm and jaded pessimism. We never understand why there is so much animosity and friction among many of the fictitional characters, most of whom are related to each other. The fictitious characters caused the book to be over long and drawn out. <br /> <br />I wish Gore Vidal had really written a good book about the way FDR analyzed the role of the USA prior to and during World War II. This would have been great. In Lincoln he stuck to the facts and it produced a wonderful political novel. In The Golden Age, Vidal veers from the facts into his own agenda, and when he can't support that agenda with factual events, the novel becomes soggy.	2005-06-09
US	35501691	R1W92VXIZOCHA9	0375705759	902715319	Elementals: Stories of Fire and Ice	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Help! A Lamia is after me!	If I had to give these short stories a grade, it would have to be a B. However one of the stories, the \\"Lamia in the Cevernnes\\" is really wonderful and creepy. <br /> <br />The volume of short stories, \\"The Djinn in the Nightingale's Eye\\" also had uneven quality but contained one of the finest novellas in the English lanuage, the piece from which the volume gets its name. <br /> <br />I sometimes think of A.S. Byatt as the writter of adult fairy stories or folk tales. The story, Lamia in the Cevernnes, certainly fits this description. It is the story of a painter, escaping conservative England to the remote countryside of France. His swimming pool seems to have a spoiled odor and ichy color, so he drains it and fills it with river water. However he has unknowingly captured a river spirit. This spirit, the Lamia, gradually makes herself known to him. First she appears as an underwater shadow, then as a caress from an invisible force under the water, then as a more distinct ghosty image, and then finally she reveals herself to the artists. She is a giant colorful snake-like creature with the eyes and mouth and teeth of a human. She asks for a kiss and promises untold fortune. Byatt describes the gradual approach of the Lamia to the artist with such creepy skill that she made my skin crawl. We have all felt the underwater touch of an invisible hand. We have all seen a glimpse of some underwater spirit, now visible, now gone, that makes the hair stand up on your head. Byatt captures this sensation so very well with her amazing craft. <br /> <br />Not as complex as her novels, but insightful well-crafted tales, her short story collections always contain at least one tale that hits me at the animal instinctual level.	2005-05-29
US	35501691	R3BVWU478UHRCL	015601226X	783241042	As Meat Loves Salt (Harvest Original)	Books	5	75	81	N	Y	Love can't cure schizophrenia	I finished this book about 4 hours ago and I feel like I have been on an emotional roller coaster. I actually feel disoriented and dizzy by this wonderful tragic book. I would have to say that this is one of the most intense reading experiences I have ever had. It opened me up and challenged me emotionally like few books or films have ever accomplished. I may read it again some day but not soon. I say this because this book is so realistic and tragic that it is painful.    Maria McCann gives us fair warning when she begins her story with a brutal murder, yet romantic idealist that I am, I kept hope alive in my heart that Jacob Cullen would overcome his dark interior voices and that he and Christopher Ferris would mature into a mutually supportive male-male couple. I hoped this to the final bleak and heartbreaking pages.     We see the world narrated through the eyes of Jacob Cullen, who maintains control of his irrational violent impulses 99% of the time, however, when he is threatened or hurt, he becomes a terror, a Dark Angel. McCann carefully allows us to see deeper and deeper into the disturbed mind of Jacob. He rationlizes much of his hostility and violence and I didn't fully understand until I was 75% of the way through the book as to how dangerous Jacob really is. He suffers so much for his actions that I empathized with him until the final 2 chapters when he facilitated the destruction of Christopher Ferris' world. When a love affair ends, there are those who will go to extremes to re-ignite the flames of passion, and if this does not work, they will seek the total destruction of their past lover. Jacob Cullen is one of these folks.    I hoped that Jacob's paranoid schizophrenic violent nature would be \\"cured\\" by his love for Christopher Ferris, his lover. They try to balance their strengths and weaknesses, each needing to submit to the other from time to time to maintain the balance needed in a male to male relationship. However, on many occassions neitherpartner submits and a struggle for dominance in the relationship clouds their interactions. Christopher Ferris is no push-over. In fact he is psychological healthy and empowered. The middle section of the book where Christopher and Jacob make love every night and plan their great commune adventure almost made me forget Jacob's intense violent reactions when he misinterprets and feels threatened.     I am very conflicted as to whether their sexual relationship postpones Jacob's fall into violent insanity or whether it aggravated it. Their struggles for dominance (Jacob gained a violent sexual dominance while Christopher gained the dominance of vision, direction and becoming Jacob's entire reason for existence)further aggravated Jacob's disturbed paranoid mind. You will understand the attraction between these men as you read the book. Christopher wishes to create a new socially just world yet he is attracted to the massive masculine force of Jacob. Jacob is aware of his faults and sees in Christopher the antithesis of his personality, a man of social grace, insight, and creativity. Christopher Ferris is not an angel however. He is manipulative and charming. He knows how to get his way which is one of the sore spots in Christopher and Jacob's relationship. During the bloody civil war, Christopher has become sick of all the gore and violence. He convinces Jacob to desert the army of Cromwell with him. Why does he chose Jacob over Nathan? Nathan is bright, articulate and would be a willing partner. He selects Jacob out of pure animal attraction, never a wise way to select a mate.  Christopher is physically and emotionally hurt so often that he can no longer forgive Jacob's violent nature and actions. He continues to love but can no longer forgive. His disillusionment with Jacob mirrors the reader's growing disillusionment but as in all failing relationships there are sexual bonds that pull folks back into destructive patterns.     I hoped that Christopher Ferris, a trulygood man with exceptional visionary leadership and interpersonal skills, would achieve his mission of building the New Jerusalem commune, a social justice experiment in a violent time of little justice. I believed this would happen even as Jacob becomes more of a disruptive and dark force in the life of the commune.     I hoped that the relationship between Christopher Ferris and Jacob Cullen would grow since it was absolutely full of creative energy and sexual electricity. I think both men loved each other but Christopher was obsessed with his vision of social justice whereas Jacob was obsessed with Christopher. This might have worked if Jacob had not been a violent paranoid schizophrenic with frightful devilish voices sounding in his scull.    The Civil War in England was a time of great social upheaval and McCann captures all the filth, inhumanity, smells, and diseases. The loss of social order would certainly be fertile ground for violence and inhumanity but also a fertile ground for a male-male relationship as well as utopian social movements.     The battle scenes, between the Catholic Cavallier forces of Charles I and the Parlimentary Protestant forces of Cromwell are terrible in their violence and cruelty and serve as a perfect background for Jacob's growing obsession with his fellow soldier, Christopher Ferris. Ferris fights the good fight while hating the blood and gore of warfare. In this gore and constant danger, Christopher Ferris finds the wild man, Jacob, and nutures him while their growing obsession with each other grows.    McCann's charaterization was superb. Every character, of which there are many, in this historic and personal tragedy comes to life. Her attention to detail and social interactions make even minor characters jump alive in your imagination.     I highly recommend this book but I warn you that it is an upsetting reading experience that will leave you with amazement at McCann's literary power.	2005-05-20
US	35501691	R2GRPKSEWSKUSL	0809001136	259833724	General from the Jungle (American Century Series)	Books	5	13	13	N	N	Liberation comes at last, but man's heart remains dark	This book is the sixth of Ben Traven's Jungle Novels. If you read all six, you would have completed around 1500 pages. Is it worth it?  I would like to answer that question by reflecting on \\"General from the Jungle\\" and then reflecting on the entire series as a whole. <br /> <br />General From the Jungle is about revolution. It is about the strategy of warfare and the strategy of reaching the hearts and minds of peasants. It tells the tale of 600 debt slave Indians who emerge from totally inhumane work conditions on mahogany plantations to take over farms and villages until they hear that the dictator of Mexico, Diaz, has escaped to England. <br /> <br />Many of the characters from previous stories are here again. Cleso, Modesta, Andreas are all here. However a new character, Juan Mendez arrives, a young Indian chieftan with military training, who leads this rag tag band to victory after victory against the federales and rurales.  <br /> <br />But remember that Traven's idology drives the story and many of our old friends from the previous novels only play bit parts, since the general and the revolution are actually the main characters. As General Mendez wins small victory after small victory, ever increasing military forces are sent against him. It is the psychology of the defeated Mexican military officers that offers fascinating reading in this final novel. As Traven brings the book to an end, he must bring nasty disgrace, complete misery, and painful torture to the Mexican military officers that are defeated by the revolution. The final chapters of the book are fascinating and painful to read since Traven must establish a sense of justice by balancing the evil done ot the Indians with the violence of disgrace against the Mexican military officers. Men have the ability to paln and implement the most disgraceful and demeaning tortures for each other which wring the last drops of human dignity from the victims. The book is fascinating and the final third is so engrossing that you can't put the book down. <br /> <br />Once you have finished the 6 books however you can look back at the strengths and weaknesses of this massive literary work. There are real strengths to this series. Traven's writing is spare and to the point. Yet he spends time telling the reader about the culture and psychology of the oppressor and the oppressed. You will understand debt slavery and the minds of the masters and slaves thoroughly when you finish the series. Traven was driven however to illustrate his world view and ideology and thus his characters are somewhat like puppets to illustrate his views about dictatorship, and racism, and man's inhumanity to his fellow man. <br /> <br />The 6 novels shine brightest when he allows himself to fully explore man's inhumanity to man. Here Traven knows the depth of sadism and the depths of depersonalization for those who are victims of abuse and torture. Traven recognizes that those in power become just as miserable as their victims when power corrupts them and enhances their sadism. <br /> <br />Thus in the end, it is when Traven wishes to make an ideological point that he ignores character and his writing is at the weakest (despite the fact that his message is extremely valid). It is when he has man face man in psychologial confrontation of oppressor and oppressed, victim and torturer, master and slave, that he reveals his exceptional insight into the depths of human cruelty.  <br /> <br />This final novel deserves 5 stars and the entire series deserves five stars also. These books are underestimated masterpieces.	2005-05-11

The book is divided into 81 essays, each about 3 pages long, and each answering a question about the global economy. You can read 3 short pages and then set the book down.  <br /> <br />The book is fairly comprehensive in approach, discussing a broad range of topics including international black markets. <br /> <br />Epping ascribes to Milton Friedman's monetary policy approach to controling inflation and economic growth through control of the money supply, interest rates, and the retention rates of lending institutions which controls the \\"multiplier effect\\" of money. This economic theory is reflected in his essays. <br /> <br />Epping also ascribes to David Ricardo's economic theory of comparative advantage which is the basis of NAFTA and free trade policy. <br /> <br />I found some of his best essays were related to economic development of the developing countries and how economic growth is tied into democratic processes. <br /> <br />This is not a heavy economics book. It is fun reading.	2005-04-28

Eye in the Door certainly explores the dissolving bonds of society in war time but Ghost Road seems to move the theme even further into the primitive societal meaning of war. <br /> <br />In Regeneration, Siefried Sassoon must find personal meaning in this horroble meaningless mess called World War I. In Eye in the Door we seen how sexual bonds are losened while society seeks to blame negative events in wartime on homosexuals. Finally in Ghost Road we see war as the sacrifice of the young male to the gods. The upperclass elderly males who direct wars sacrifice the young sons of the working class on an altar of horror. Dr. Rivers makes this connect as he treats the young Billy Pryor for shell shock while remembering the ritual sacrifice of the Melanesian head hunters. <br /> <br />The trilogy is absolutely great and should be read in order to follow the character developement as well as the exploration of war that Barker develops differently with each book.	2005-04-22

Whereas Regeneration is superb in its exploration of the consciousness of Siegfreid Sassoon and his psychiatrist, Dr. River; Eye in the Door expands the character of Billy Prior to become one of the most psychologically well developed and complex characters in English fiction.  <br /> <br />Billy Prior , a bisexual, has both male and female lovers in this novel. These relationships are embedded in the homophobic atmosphere of war torn London. Prior, suffering from \\"shell shock\\" struggles with his identify of war hero and pacifism. He struggles with childhood trauma in a society where repressesions are let lose in a war charged atmospher. <br /> <br />The book is beautifully written. Whereas Regeneration explores Sassoon's struggles to brng meaning into a meaningless situation, Eye in the Door explores more of the societal struggles with the war and individual reactions to the pressures of a war time society.  <br /> <br />I loved this book and would give it 10 stars if I could.	2005-04-21

The story revolves around the hositalization of poet, Siegfried Sassoon, for shell shock during World War I. He is being treated by Dr. Rivers, psychiatrist and anthropologist. The conversations, memories, and internal dialogues of these two men make up much of the book. How does an intelligent and refletive man come to try to give meaning to a meaningless and pointless catastrophy such as World War I. This is Sassoon's dilemna. He is against the war, not as a religious objector or a pacifist, but because he has come to see it as meaningless, pointless, horror imposed on the youth of Europe by an arrogant, stubborn, ruling class. Sassoon struggles during his hospitalization with the grief of losing young friends to the war, the frustration and irony of knowing that the excessive killing was pointless, and that he must find meaning in his sacrifice if he is to return to the front lines. Dr. Rivers is in a similar situation. He must assist men who have had a nervous breakdown compensate just enought to be returned to the front lines where they will no doubt be cannon fodder. He heals so that the sacrifice may continue.  <br /> <br />The ethical and historic issues abound in this beautifully written novel. Whereas Joseph Heller in Catch 22 plays on the dark humor of the absurdities of war; Barker does not go for the sarcastic humor of the hanged. Rather, she takes a much more existentialist approach, of exploring how we try to create meaning to survive pointless and disasterous situations. I was reminded of Edith Stein, Ph.D., the phenomenologist philospher who became a Dutch nun but was then gased by the Nazis. While being transported by train across Germany to the gas chambers she tried to make sense of her senseless situation. She decided that she would offer herself up to God as the sacrificial lamb so that he might end the insanity and destruction of World War II. You will see that Sassoon stuggles with a similar situation, how to return to an absurdly deadly war with a sense of meaning, even if that meaning has to be forged out of our own soul and exists only for ourself.	2005-04-19

We have many characters in this fifth book that were introduced to us in the earlier books. Andreas, the oxen driver from The Carretta, longs to escape from the mahogony plantation and return to his young wife. Celso, the heroic Indian man of action, again plays a central role as he did in March to the Monteria. Candido, the dirt farmer, loses his wife Marcelina to appendecitis because the drunken doctor refuses to operate without outlandish payment. Candido, his two sons and his younger sister Modesta, go to the plantation to pay back the price of Marcelina's medical and funeral expenses. Don Gabriel is back, tricking young Indian men to sell themselves into debt slavery from which there is little chance of escape. The three money hungry sadistic plantation owners, Don Felix, Don Severo, and Don Acacio are back with a vengence. Their cruelty to the Indians is hard to imagine.  <br /> <br />Traven however is very wise in that he brings into this situation three components of successful revolution: the chance event that signals vulnerability of the oppressors, the thinker who brings reflective consciousness to the oppressed so that they begin to understand their conditions, and the catalyst event that drives the revolutionaries forward.  <br /> <br />The chance event that signals vulnerability is when Don Acacio unjustly tries to beat and hang two Indian men for a transgression they did not commit. He lets down his guard and the two men fight back, blinding Don Acacio. <br /> <br />A new group of characters, revolutionists on the run, join the plantation work crews to hide. One of them, Martin Trinidad, raises the consciousness of Celso, the natural leader of the debt slaves. <br /> <br />Finally, Don Felix's cruel cutting off of the ears of Candido's young child, stimulates his aunt Modesta to fight back which becomes a snowball of death for the plantation owners and their foremen.  <br /> <br />This is the fifth novel in the series. In the first novel, Government, we see the corruption at all levels of society and government in Mexico that leads to the suppression of the native Mexican Indians. In the other three novels we are introduced to the characters Andreas, Celso, and learn the terrible business of the jungle mahogony production. Finally in this fifth novel, the tide is turned and the revolution begins. The novel ends as the revolutionists emerge from the jungles and begin to march across the corrupt fincas, encouraging the peons to rebel.	2005-04-15

It is the finest political novel by an American writer. It has few rivals, maybe \\"I, Claudius\\" and \\"Claudius the God\\", both by Robert Graves, are as good, but students of history, political science or leadership will find \\"Lincoln\\" to be an exception work of literary art.  <br /> <br />There are several reasons why I so strongly recommend this book. <br /> <br />First, this novel demonstrates exceptionally well the balance between self interests and loyalty, as exemplified in the Lincoln cabinet. Salmon Chase, the Secretary of the Treasury, and William Seward, the Secretary of State are finely portrayed characters. They both were positioning themselves in the Lincoln presidency to succeed him. This required careful political skills to appear supportive but make every move in regard to self interests. The passages where Lincoln wins over William Seward into a real honest partnership are masterful and my admiration for Seward soared. Salmon Chase on the other hand continues to play a careful game of undermining the President behind his back while playing the loyal servant to his face. The passage where Chase is eventually confronted by Lincoln, who was never fooled in the first place, is a wonderful example of the careful interpersonal chess moves required in political life. <br /> <br />Second, the novel does a wonderful job of demonstrating how difficult it is get someone to follow orders and do the job right. Lincoln remains totally frustrated with his generals, especially the handsome, charming General McClellan, with his own political ambitions. The man refused to engage the enemy. Lincoln eventually fires him and promotes General Grant. Mrs. Lincoln is somewhat scadalized by the Grants, but Lincoln finally has a military genius on his side and Lincoln offers minimal guidance as long as he sees the war turning around due to Grant's initiatives. <br /> <br />Third, the novel does a great job of demonstrating the total hell that Lincoln occupied in the White House. The public came into the public rooms of the White House every morning to try to intercept the President on his way to his office. His wife engaged in questionable kick-back schemes with the White House staff. His older sons went to war and his younger son dies of swamp fever. Mary Lincoln was a burden to the President and her nervous breakdown after the death of their child, Willie, further burdened this exceptional political genius.  <br /> <br />Fourth, Lincoln practiced careful adaptive leadership, keeping his cabinet and officers focused on the grim realities they had to face every day without flights of hubris and fancy. <br /> <br />Lincoln held our nation together at its darkest hour. Vidal was able to capture the amazing day to day reality that this feat entailed. Vidal creates a vision of Lincoln that comes to life in this fine novel.	2005-04-04
US	35501691	R170PWN2GEWMKO	0140058508	499822874	1066: The Year of the Conquest	Books	5	30	30	N	Y	Very readable insightful popular history	There were several strong features of David Howarth's book 1066. <br /> <br />First, there was excellent characterization. King Harold and Duke William were fully protrayed in all their strengths and weaknesses. They are both drawn as humans with a mixture of assets and contradictions. William was a military prodigy since age 19 whereas Harold was a strong self-made man trying to cobble England back together after the rule of Edward the Confessor. The story is full of heroes and villians. King Edward the Confessor was a problematic ruler who set the stage for the conflict, supposedly promising the crownof England to William, which was against English law. Harold's cruel sadistic traitor brother, Tostig, caused much ruin and destruction of the English nation. There are many other characters, including the wild Norseman Harold Hardrada who invaded England independently but simultaneously with Duke William the Conqueror. Harold could probably have defeated one invasion but not two. Your heart sinks when Harold learns during the victory feast over his defeat of Harold Hardrada' army, that William has invaded and is marching inland. <br /> <br />Second, there is excellent explanations about the technology of farming, law and courts, social structures, and warfare at the time. Howarth contrast the Norman knights, their code of chivalry, their use of horses in warfare, with the English footsoldier with his Norse two handed axe. Howarth is no fan of chivalry which he argues is a destructive social structure that diverts the male children of the aristocracy into warlike activiees starting at age 8 and that creates professional warriors who disdain work and their fellow citizens while they seek and glorify violence and warfare. I found it very interesting that archers were not used in the Battle of Hastings because archery was a priviledge sport used to kill deer that belonged bo the aristocracy. The common soldier would not have access to this art reserved for the nobility.The use of ships to transport soldiers nad horses was also well told.  <br /> <br />Third, the context and times were well explained, including the corrrupt papacy which had never been elected by the Cardinals until right prior to the battle. Most interesting was the rule of law practiced in England priro to the invasion which was destoryed by the invasion and the dictatorship of the Normans over the Anglo-Saxons. This resulted in 300,000 Anglo-Saxon deaths from starvation while 200,000 Frenchmen relocated to England, changing the language and customes forever. <br /> <br />Fourth,the final battle was well described in terms of strategy, human limitations, and bloody gore. Full of facts, well told, and briefly presented, this little book gets 5 stars.	2005-04-02
US	35501691	RDSUIYWHC7A8J	031230711X	718295841	Ungrateful Daughters: The Stuart Princesses Who Stole Their Father's Crown	Books	5	8	9	N	N	An enjoyable history	I found this book to be excellent and fun to read, primarily because the author's frame of reference is family dynamics and personality painted against the larger backdrop of historic events. <br /> <br />The story is primarily about the Glorious Revolution in which the Catholic James II lost the throne of England to his daughter and son-in-law; Mary and William of Orange.  <br /> <br />Whereas Charles II had as many political talents as Bill Clinton, his dull brother, James II, unfortunately lacked insight into interpersonal relationships, diplomacy at the personal and national level, and intelligence. He embraced Catholicism at a time that only 3% of the English population would admit to being Catholic and when Louis XIV was enacting deadly policies against the Protestants in his country. His daughters had been reared Protestant and the entire power infrastructure of England was Protestant.  <br /> <br />Mary was certainly a sympathetic figure as portrayed here. She was 6 feet tall and appeared to be a big-boned girl. She towered over the other women in the court. She towered over her husband, William. Her motivations for taking the crown of England from her father were greatly influenced by her Protestant religion and her devotion to her husband who served as the few checks on the military agression of the absolute dictator, Louis XIV. Her death and funeral are touching and William's devotion to her was interesting considering his tendency to be attracted to handsome Dutch blond army officers. <br /> <br />William is portrayed as calculating, strategic and cripled. His homosexuality is briefly discussed in hypothetical terms. Other historians have indicated that the weight of evidence is that he was indeed homosexual. He was the major political force that held Louis XIV in check, a task he persued all his life with success despite the fact that his opponent was king of the largest European power at the time.  <br /> <br />Ann is first portrayed as the most ungrateful of the two daughters. Her treatment of her step-mother Mary of Modena and her campaign of disinformation regarding her younger half brother's birth reveal her to be scheming with the ability to twist the facts for her advantage. Yet in the later parts of the book, she appears to be the pitiful captive of the Churchills, especially the maniacal,out-spoken Sarah Churchill. The quotations from the letters between Queen Ann and Sarah Churchill reveal an almost lesbian attachement in their youth and a spiteful angry co-dependency in their old age.  <br /> <br />The book is a wonderful read. The characters were so well developed and portrayed that the history of the times came alive.	2005-03-25
US	35501691	R1JYTMVOJGSZQ8	0679762221	677408907	The Djinn in the Nightingale's Eye	Books	5	26	26	N	N	This book contains one of the finest novellas in English	If I could give this book 10 stars for the novella \\"The Djinn in the Nightingale's Eye\\", I certainly would. I think it is one of the three finest short stories in the English language along with Isak Dineson's \\"Babette's Feast\\" and Paul Bowles'\\"Delicate Prey\\". <br /> <br />Two thirds of the book are devoted to this novella. There are 4 short stories that make up the other third of the book. These stories: The Glass Coffin, Gode's Story, Tale of the Eldest Princess, and Dragon's Breath, are very well constructed adult fairy tales and well worth reading. <br /> <br />However \\"The Dijinn in the Nightingale's Eye\\" is exceptional. In this story, Gillian, a middleaged scholar is in Istanbul for a conference of experts on myths, legends, and fairy tales. Her husband has divorced her after their two daughters had grown and left home. From here the story starts to spin story within story in rich overlays of meaning and metaphor. Gillian is an expert in wishes since she is an expert in fairy tales. The wisdom of her three wishes drives the tale. We are treated to an interpretation of one of Chaucer's tales as well as a re-telling of Gilgamesh.  <br /> <br />I am certain that rich feminist interpretations are possible, considering the images of the role of women that change throughout the book. The characters go to St. Sophia (named after the feminine aspect of the Holy Spirit) where they put their finger into a hole in a marble column that remains forever moist.  <br /> <br />The writing was very erotic for a fairy tale. The Djinn appears nude in Gillian's hotel room, he is 20 times larger than a human, as are his genitals. Byatt then tales us of the overpowering smell of masculinity coming from this handsome giant creature. <br /> <br />The Djinn tells tales of his 1000 year existence in the courts of Arab kings. His tales of love reveal that his heart is as mature as the heart of Gillian, making them a wonderful match for the adventures they undergo. <br /> <br />I was thoroughly entertained with the wisdom of each of Gillian's three wishes and her ability to string out these three wishes as she gained more knowledge of the Djinn. It is her final wish that reveals the ultimate power in the Universe, at least from my perspective. Maybe this is why I was so captivated by Byatt's wonderful novella.  <br /> <br />I read the novella twice over the last 5 years and it remains unforgettable for me. I can not recommend it more strongly.	2005-03-20
US	35501691	R32GWMJXGA5NDZ	0486234118	682393693	Concerning the Spiritual in Art	Books	5	100	101	N	N	The philosophical breaktrough that lead to abstraction	All art students are advised to read this short masterpiece but I suspect few young artists take the time to read the book that best explains the concepts that lead to abstract painting in the modern era.  I think it would be useful if I pointed out some of the most important and interesting themes and ideas that Kandinsky explains so tht you can see the vast range of this short 80 page book. <br /> <br />First, Kandinsky was greatly influenced by music and recognized that music was judged under different standards than was painting. For example, music is not judged by how much the music sounds like noises in nature. We would never go to a symphony to hear the musicians imitate dogs barking, or ambulance sirens, or police whistles. Yet painting is judged by how well the painter reflects the natural world in a realistic style. Thus for Kandinsky, the ability for painting to lose the object, would free painting to pursue the spiritual. However, the ability for the painter to paint without painting the object is very much a challenge. He gives advice to the read on the use of line, form, and color to try to achieve this goal. But Kandinsky recognized how fragile this makes the painting process, for any brush stroke or color or shape can evoke the material world again. Kandinsky wishes the artist to free themselves from the material world so that they can express their inner impulses. Thus the abstract painting requires contemplation to reveal its meaning. Furthermore, the meaning may be a projection of the inner life of the viewer as much as it is the inner life of the artists.  This concept is not new to music but it certainly was new to painting in 1911. Now we hear about the Rothko chapel in Fort Worth, where large abstract paintings by Mark Rothko create a meditative space for contemplative viewers. The spiritual aspect of abstract art is now a given in our culture, no longer a radical idea. <br /> <br />Second, Kandinsky has very insightful comments regarding hiscontemporaries. He recognizes Matisse as the 20th century master of color and Picasso as the 20th century master of line but he faults them both for not making the final step toward complete abandonment of the physical world. For example, he points out that even though Picasso developed the collage and Cubism, that Cubism is deconstruction of the physical world but not abandonment of the physical world and thus Picasso remains earth bound. <br /> <br />Third, Kandinsky asserts that imitative painting of other eras was a deadly trap for the artist, yet responding to the eternal call of the unconscious forces in an earlier period of art history was a valid area of exploration. His example is Picasso and other artists interest in the primitive. These artists did not wish to copy the primitive works but to respond to the same unconscious content that the primitive artist had tapped. <br /> <br />Fourth, Kandinsky believed that art progressed, that artistic concepts built on each other and that there was a triangle of artistic conception that moved forward to some end point, yet to be discovered. This concept of progress in art, similar to the idea of progress in science, and not related to such cultural values as progress in fashion has lead to much debate in the post-modern era. It is interesting to read Kandinski's opinion on this topic and reflect on the last 100 years to see if he could be correct or mistaken. I prefer to think that the progress is the continued exploration of the human unconscious, an infinity of symbols and images connecting us to our spiritual base.  <br /> <br />Fifth, Kandinsky believed in a conceptual hierarchy in the world of painters and he thought only a few make it to the top of the pyramid where a few create truely unique solutions to visual problems. The others are imitative or formulaic and form the base of the pyramid. <br /> <br />Sixth, Kandinsky warns against pattern painting since he thinks this leads to monotany and away from spirituality. In this regard contemporary artists have certainly challenged his conception. In fact, Agnes Martin, the minimalist pattern painter, is regarding as a great spiritual painter. In my opinion, Kandinski would have loved Agnes Martin's paintings. The examples of pattern painting he gives in the book sound more like the patterns on wall paper more than the minimal grids of an Agnes Martin painting.  <br /> <br />Finally, after all the explanation of why an abstract painting style should evolve and how artists can achieve that style, Kandinsky makes the linkage between the outer world of the painting and the inner world of the viewer with a quote from Meterlinck \\"The soul is curious for beauty.\\" <br /> <br />Every artist owes it to themselves to read this short book on which so much art history, philosophy, and practice has been based.	2005-03-15

Trozas is the fourth in the Jungle Series, written by B. Traven around the economic class structure of Mexico during the dictatorship of Porfirio Diaz.  <br /> <br />The book is short on plot and short on character development, but it gives almost a case study version of the inhumane conditions that peons endured on the debt slavery mahogany plantation.  <br /> <br />Andre again plays a role, as he did in The Carreta and March to the Monteria. He wishes to return to his common law wife but must toil under unbelieveable conditions to work off his father's debts. <br /> <br />Celso also plays a role, as he did in March to the Monteria where he was the primary heroic figure. He is strong, heroic, dignified, and yet caught in the web of jungle, insects, disease, and violence along with all the other Indian men slaveing for the Spaniards. <br /> <br />Whereas man's injustice to man is certainly the major theme of this book, the theme of survival under incredible conditions also runs throughout the book. <br /> <br />In March to the Monteria, Cleso is a strong young Indian male, working nude in the jungle, hacking down tons of mahogany a day.  He tries to escape once his debt is paid and due to his skill, the owners always find a hidden charge and bring him back. In Trozas he tries to maintain his dignity and raise the consciousness of the other men.  <br /> <br />In The Carreta, Andre is an oxen cart drive with a young common-law wife. InTrozas these skills are put to use as the drags mahoganylogs through muddy swamps to the the river where they can be floated to the lumber mills. He also is trapped. <br /> <br />The reason I did not give this book a 5 star rating however is that it really had little plot or character development. It was best described as a study in the economic injustices that allowed much of Mexico's dark Indians to be suppressed and exploited by the white Spainards. Victor Hugo always had a tendency to engage in social studies in his work, but he always returned to the plot. I wish Traven had been more of a novelist and less of an anthropologist.	2005-03-14

They are usually called the Jungle Novels. In the first book; Government, there is a detailed explanation of the social and economic structure under the dictatorship of Porfirio Diaz. We see how Indian peon work on farms as serfs, always in dept to the large land owners. In some ways the first book reminded me of the books of Victor Hugo where he combines social science with novel.<br /><br />In the second book; The Carreta, a young man makes his living traveling the roads of Mexico with an ox drawn cart full of goods owned by his master.<br /><br />This third novel in the series is actually better than the first two in some ways. In the first novel, Traven gives a tremedous amount of social commentary, which is good, but the characters lack the cohesion and depth of a novel. In the second novel, a romance between Andres and a young runaway Indian girl becomes a marriage, but they experience one challenge after another in a system that is rigged against them.<br /><br />In this third novel, Celso, a young Indian man who has assumed his father's debts and has gone to work in the mahogony plantations of Southern Mexico, must survive under the cruelest and most brutal of conditions. Celso is a more heroic character than characters in the first two novels. He is heroic in assuming his father's debts. He has a critical consciousness that allows him to make judgements about the system in which he is trapped. He begins to try to figure a way out of the system instead of resigning his fate to daily back breaking toil and death. The reader dearly wants him to escape. Therefore the reader becomes more emotionally involved in his struggel to escape from the man-destroying experiences of the Monteria, the mahogany plantations. Celso has a sense of justice and injustice that allows him to look beyond his personal circumstance and at the circumstances that entrap his people.	2005-03-12
US	35501691	R1MELTWIT86RU2	1566630452	564661454	The Carreta (Jungle Novels)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	A tale of suppression and hardship	The Carreta, the second of B Traven's Jungle Series,is the tale of a young Indian peon, Andres. The story shows the way the Indian people of Mexico became serfs or peons to the wealthy Hispanic landowners. The corrrupt government of Porfirio Dias allowed for over half of the Mexican population to live as virtual debt slaves, always toiling for the landowners.  Andres's family, like all peon families, must work in the fields for the rich and get further and further in debt. Eventually he is traded in a poker game by his master. He then leaves his family and becomes a carreta driver.  These folks drove simple oxen carts across the Mexican frontier, carrying goods from village to village. During one of the trips, he meets a homeless displaced Indian girl of around 15 and they become man and wife.  <br /> <br />Traven paints a picture of economic and social oppression, fueled by racism and illiteracy, and ripe for socialist revolution. He tells us of a nation that is rotten from the President on down, living like parasites on the toil and sweat of the poor.  A simple story in many ways, the focus of Traven is frequently in the details and explanations of the economic conditions rather than on character to character interactions. These interactions interest him most when there is injustice.  <br /> <br />This book was not as oriented toward teaching the reader the economic system of oppression that Traven's first book, Government, exemplifies.  However, it is a good read.	2005-03-12

I think the reason his work is often misunderstood is that he calls for major dietary and life style changes in order to REVERSE cardiovascular disease, something that had not been demonstrated prior to his research.  <br /> <br />I am cooking a soup inspired by one of his recipes right now in my kitchen: chick peas, leeks, and tomato juice soup seasoned with sage and thyme. <br /> <br />As I read some of the negative reviews of his book I began to realize that many readers may have confused the mediators for cardiovascular disease with the actual disease process. Thus his diet does cause weight loss, does reduce cholesterol, does reduce high blood pressure but these are all mediators for cardiovascular disease. A person might try other diets for weight loss or to lower blood pressure, but reversing cardiovascular disease requires more effort. The amazing accomplishment was that he actually demonstrated a reduction in cardiovascular disease in his patients with this approach.  <br /> <br />I can not immagine a single heart attack victim in this country not going on this diet immediately. I was convinced by his data and the logical consistency of his approach.	2005-03-03

The miracle is that a flexible system of government was forged from this complex interplay of lofty enlightement philosophy with base ego centered self interests.  <br /> <br />Vidal brings historic characters to life with tiny details, for example Abigail Adams becomes disqusted when Benjamin Franklin's mistress feeds her lap dog from the dinner table. While Washington is urging that the flimsy Articles of Confederation be replaced with a Constitution, he and his mother have a falling out. The book is full of these personal touches that bring the historic characters alive in the mind of the reader. <br /> <br />The team work of these early founders, despite their disagreements, was fantastic. Adams charmed the Dutch while Jefferson and Franklin charmed the French.  The genius of Hamilton and Madison is balanced with the exceptional political skills of Washington.  <br /> <br />I am always amazed when conservatives attack Gore Vidal, since he is an advocate of maximum liberty of the individual, and he will viciously criticise FDR with the same venom he would use against George W Bush. <br /> <br />The reader is left with a feeling of wonder and amazement that our principals of government have survived despite the folly of many a generation of politicians. Vidal would have us recognize that we must remain vigilant and skeptical regarding our nation's leadership and direction.	2005-02-28

I found the mixture of Irish and British male adolescent working class slang to be musical and amusing. Behan had a wonderful sense of dialogue and the manner in which young men verbally duel with each other, striving for rank and dominance and friendship.<br /><br />Second, the story is unique. A 17 year old IRA terrorist is arrested and sent to a youth facility full of adolescent petty criminals. The worlds of incarcerated vs. free; adult vs. adolescent; Catholic vs. Protestant; Irish vs. English: and  criminal vs. political prisoner are just a few of the wonderful tensions and juxtapositions that Behan creates.<br /><br />Third, is Behan's slow pace and ability to observe the most remote details, describe them uniquely, and then weave these streams of images together to create a world and to populate it with characters that ring true with every word.<br /><br />Fourth, the story is a tremendous testament to the goodness of mankind. Underneath the tensions, the rivalry, the ideology, the story reveals the simple common kindness of mankind. Brendan Behan may have evoked this kindness through his own exceptional openness and acceptance of his fellowman or he may have observed this kindness through this insightful but possibly biased vision of the innate goodness of mankind; but, none the less, his faith in our sometimes distorted and crippled species shines through the autobiography like a beacon of hope.<br /><br />I wish I could have given more than 5 stars to this superb work. Don't rush through this book. Let Behan take you into his experiences and his kind view of the world of man.	2005-02-19

The witty writing pulled me through the book, almost like I was running rather than reading.  <br /> <br />The character of Vernon reminded me of Holden Caulfield from Catcher in the Rye. However, the youth of today are expose to far more shady sides of human nature and sexualtiy than were previous generations due to the media's ability to reveal every form of mindless perversion in their mad dash to higher ratings. In fact the power of the American media to help shape our vision of truth is certainly one of the main themes of the book. <br /> <br />Poor Vernon, surrounded by lower middle class Texan adults who are self serving and idiotic. The fresh eyes of a nieve youth like Vernon always cast light on the follies of desire. Yet, even as Vernon sees his mother's weaknesses and failures,he grows to see her strengths and intentions.  <br /> <br />There is also a Colombine theme here that deserves exploration. A tortured gay young Mexican, Jesus, kills 16 classmates and then himself. A dark comedy is spun around this tragedy which never seems real in the novel. Vernon is continually being pulled into the aftermath of the tragedy and nearly does not escape.  <br /> <br />I was surprized the book won the Booker prize. DBC Pierre's use of language is superb. He is a master of imagery and pacing in his writing. However, the plot had gaps - in fact - too many gaps and untied isssues to deserve the Booker prize.  <br /> <br />Have fun and read this book. It is a very quick read. But as social commentary, it does not deserve 5 stars or the Booker prize.	2005-02-18

I wish that I had also purchased a book on O'ahu where we spent a week of vacation.  <br /> <br />There is a section on the history of the islands. When visiting Honolulu, the Bishop Museum offers very good exhibitions of the history and culture of the Hawaiian islands. One room is devoted to the royal family. Another explains how the Hawaiians arrived in the islands around 400 A.D.  The museum offers educations shows every 30 minutes, we attended a lecture on Hawaiian plants, the mythology of the islanders, and the hula. This is a great place to visit if you have kids.   <br /> <br />Honolulu and Waikiki have their own chapter. We had a room at the Hilton Hawaiian Village,one of the hotels recommended in the book. It is centrally located, right on Waikiki beach and yet only blocks from the Honolulu business district. Our room overlooked the city where we could watch outriggers race their boats in the central canal that drains rain water away from the city.  <br /> <br />The guide tells you that The Bus, the island's public transportation system takes visitors to all parts of the island and thus minimizes the need for a rental car. Because we like to hike in the rain forrests, we found it better to rent a car so that we could locate trail heads and have a car waiting for us at the end of a hike.  <br /> <br />In the center of downtown Honolulu is the Iolani Palace, the state captital and multiple museums. Also the grand black and gold leaf statue of King Kamahameha overlooks the rush of downtown traffic.  <br /> <br />One evening we took a nice walk around Kapilani Park, a short 1.8 mile loop, and we peeped between the bushes into the Honolulu Zoo and watched their herd of giraffes being fed.  <br /> <br />The giant volcanoe ruins of Diamond Head dominate the landscape of Honolulu and Waikiki. The hike to the top of Diamond Head starts up in the mountains behind the volcanoe. If you drive into the parking lot the cost is $5 per car. If you park outside the volcane and walk through the tunnel to the park entrance, the hiking fee is $1 per person. The hike is fun. There are multiple switchbacks as you climb the mountain. There are tunnels, stairs, and old military installations before you reach the look outs at the top. The views are magnificent! The ocean is a 100 shades of blue and the entire Waikiki beach can be seen. Slow down when walking up or down the mountain to enjoy the wild birds. The Java Sparrows; with their magenta beaks and legs, grey bodies, and bold black and white heads; are beautiful birds. <br /> <br />We ate dinner at the Todai. This Asian seafood buffet was pretty amazing and I would recommend it to anyone who is up for all you can eat sushi.  <br /> <br />In the residential mountains above Honolulu is a double-bonus. The Manoa Waterfall trail is next to the Lyon Arboretum, a property of the University of Hawaii. The hike up to the waterfall is not challenging and the falls are beautiful. The arboretum is full of exotic trees, ferns, and flowers. We took picture after picture of the tropic rainforrest blooms. Guides tell you to never leave personal objects in your car at these parking spots. Please take this advice seriously.  <br /> <br />Three highways connect Honolulu to the other side of O'ahu. The Pali highway, the Lekileki Highway, and Highway 3 all offer spectacular views. The giant Pali mountains reach into the misty clouds, covered with tropic vegetation and waterfalls when it rains. The Pali highway has a view point that allows a great view of the north central part of O'ahu. <br /> <br />Greater O'ahu also has a chapter devoted to it. <br /> <br />We went to visit the Summer Palace of Princess Emma in the Pali just beyond the city of Honolulu. The gardens were small but well groomed. The house was very similar in structure and design to the grand homes ofthe southern USA. The guides were senior women who knew incredible amounts about Hawaiian history and were eager to share. Emma's hadn carved bed had images of feathers for royalty and pineapples for hospitality. The bedspreads on all the beds were the wonderful Hawaiian quits with plant imagery sewn onto each. <br /> <br />We drove east until we reached Makapu'u Lookout and Lighthouse. The walk is all uphill going to the top but allows wonderful views of the ocean all along the way. We heard that January was the time of year to see whales with new born calves, but unfortunately we did not see any. Kaohikaipu Island and Manana (Rabbit) Island are beautiful from the high cliffs of Makapu'u. The waters are churning turquoise and ultramarine. The further out you drive past this point, the more rural the island becomes. As we reached the northern shores, the waves became more and more dramatic. They were grand crashing giants, dangerous and fierce and beautiful. We drove all the way to Kaena Point, the Northwest tip of the island. You have to park your car and walk the final two miles to reach the tip. We heard the trail was hot and dry. We found just the opposite. It was wet and muddy and misty with the pounding surf. We walked on the muddy trail most of the way but we also tried walking on the rocky cliffs and beaches. The trail may be dry in the summer but in the winter, I would strongly recommend hiking boots to be able to navagate the muddy trails.  <br /> <br />We visited Waianae, a community of native Hawaiians. It was very interesting to see a community full of natives, rather than Asians and Caucasians who now make up 50% of the population. The native folks greet each other and depart from each other by putting their foreheads together and breathing a single breath together.  <br /> <br />I would say that the guide was good, basic information. The maps did not not have enough detail. We found the book to be best supplemented with local maps and publications onthe sights and sounds of Honolulu, Waikiki, and Oahu.	2005-02-06

I found it to be full of profound concepts wrapped in a chaotic and fantastic romp of a good story.<br /><br />First, I thought the story was a tale of revenge. Bulgakov was highly discriminated against and his work suppressed throughout his career and life. A genius' work is smothered by Soviet brainless censors while a literaray elite develops composed of talentless writers and editors who only push the Communist Party line. Bulgakov has these nit-wits become the play-toys of the Devil in a story of hilarious dark comedy. Bulgakov never got revenge against the system that impoverished him until after his death when readers laugh at the incredible uncomfortable situations the Devil creates for the Moscow talentless literary elite.<br /><br />Second, the  tale is a satiric critique of the Soviet system under Stalin. Many Soviet methods of social control, such as apartment assignments by the state, set the stage for wild adventures for Soviet citizens caught in this overly centralized society. The chapter on the Soviet authorities trying to take over the apartment of the be-headed editor from the Devil and his assistants is some of the most clever satire ever written. The magic shows performed by the Devil in a state-owned theater was a perfect commentary on the weaknesses of the Soviet system.<br /><br />Third, the novel is a superb essay on the killing of God as a political act. The Devil is delighted to come to the Soviet Union where belief in God is under attack and atheists rise to positions of power and status. The Soviets tried to kill God to better control their citizens. The genius of this book is that Bulgakov tells us the tale of Pontius Pilot and the High Priest of Jerusalem playing a careful came of strategy with the life of Jesus Christ. Both men had reasons to kill Jesus so that they could both maintain political power. But these two men are wise and they wish for the other party to take the blame for the crucifiction. Since Jewish law did not allow for the death penalty, the High Priest must manipulate Pilot to give the orders. However Pilot uses spys and murderers to cast blame back on the Jewish leadership by murdering Judas and throwing thirty silver pieces into the home of the High Priest. God must always be killed/maimed/distorted for a totalitarian government to maintain control. Suppression of God doesn't simultaneously suppress the Devil.<br /><br />Fourth, the events related in the story are extremely fun to read. The encounter with the Devil in the public park, the scenes in the dead editor's apartment, the magic show, the insane assylum, the Devil's ball, the flashbacks to Jerusalem, all will stick in your mind for days after you finish the book.<br /><br />This novel was finally released after Bulgakov had been dead for 30 years.

US	35501691	R6UF3G497RWAQ	0691002371	594951791	The Grail Legend	Books	5	68	69	N	N	Extremely thorough and inclusive approach to the Grail legen	Emma Jung and Marie-Louise von Franz have produced a very comprehensive analysis of the legend of the Holy Grail legend. Jung spent over 20 years collecting the background information. Von Franz spent 15 years pulling together the final manuscript which was published after Emma Jung's death.<br /><br />The book explores the historic origin of the legend in both Welsh/Celtic and Christian legend. The legend appears to integrate 3 influences: the legends of the early Welsh/Celtic people who were driven into the hills by the Saxon invaders, the Christian legend of the grail and the stone covering the grave of Christ, and the major shift in Western consciousness regarding the role of women around the reign of Henry II and Eleanor of Acquitaine.<br /><br />The story is about the heroic actions and adventures of the fool knight, Perceval, that are needed to heal the wounded Fisher King and revive his famine plagued kingdom. Much of the book explores all the images and multiple variations around this myth.<br /><br />The legend would imply that in all men a wounded Self(Fisher King) limits and shuts off the powers and creativity of the archetypes and other unconscious forces. The healed Fisher King is a strong Self, the king of the unconscious, who can navigate and attract unconscious forces and influences. The beautiful woman, the Anima, acts as a messenger between the ego consciousness and the unconscious. The Grail is the site where the opposites are united, the personality becomes whole,the internal struggles against opposing forces within the self stops, and thus the healing of the King (Self) is at hand. Each of the psychological constructs: ego, consciousness, unconscious, archtype, shadow, anima, animus, Self, etc. are shown in the characters and various props/objects within the legend.<br /><br />Students of the legends of King Arthur and the Round Table will find this to be a very scholarly study of the particular tale of Perceval and his search of the Holy Grail. The Round Table is connected to the two preceeding tables - the table where Christ held the Last Supper with his disciples and the table that becomes the Altar for the Holy Communion.<br /><br />Students of pre-Saxon Britian will find this  work to identify multiple primitive Celtic and Welsh myths and legends.<br /><br />Students of Jung will find this legend actually is able to encompass almost all the major constructs of Jungian theory into one comprehensive legend. Jung identifies the Self as the part of the personality through whom God speaks. This makes sense if we see the Self as the king of the unconscious, a land of symbol and archetype. If the Self is wounded, the land of archetype and symbol is barren and thus the voice of God is not heard. But when the Self is healed, God is able to speak through the language of image, myth, archetype, and symbol. The heroic knight is able to heal the wounded King by asking whom the Grail serves. The Grail is the site where opposing forces are united and integrated and thus tension and internal conflict is reduced or eliminated. Jung and von Franz also point out that the Grail, the stone over the grave of Christ, the philosopher's stone, and the legendary figure of Merlin all are capable of playing the role of the site where the opposites come together to bring about wholeness. When wholeness occurs, the Fisher King is healed. When the Fisher King (the Self) is healed, the land is no longer barren but bursts with growth of instincts, symbols, myths, images, archetypes, allowing God to come fully into the personality.  This is called salvation in Christian culture and enlightenment in other cultures. Carl Jung offers an amazingly rich theoretically constructed human personality with such internal consistency that he was able to explain most all human ocnditions from mental illness to religious salvation using his constructs.<br /><br />I recommend this book highly, supplement your reading with other books by Carl Jung as you read, but your quest for your own Holy Grail is worth the effort.	2005-01-08

I would not recommend this book to anyone unless they have read the other two books in the trilogy. Beauty and Tristan are kidnapped by a Sultan and his court, but the sexual games remain much the same with spanking as the primary focus of obedience and submission. The sex scenes remain repetitive and thus border on boring. Even after three books, Beauty remains very one dimensional, almost mentally retarded. There really is no plot, only situations for sexual encounters. The ending, where Beauty and Tristan are finally joined as husband and wife, King and Queen, is extremely weak and contrived. This series is the weakest product produced by Anne Rice. She should have trusted her characters to have some internal growth and change, some intelligence.	2004-12-07

I thought the book had too thin a plot, poor character development, and so many spankings that I was bored half way through. However, I thought that since it was part of a trilogy that maybe I should read the second book to see if the plot develops and whether the characters become more complex as the story unfolds. Unfortunately, I was disappointed again. The story line remains thin with the characters falling into sexual situation after situation, never gaining much insight. <br /> <br />There is a twist of plot that bears mentioning. In the first novel, Beauty is a slave in a palace. However due to her rebelliousness she is sold as a slave to villagers. Also sold is the rebellious Prince Tristan. Tristan's master is Nicholas and a male to male sexual power struggle actually becomes the focus of much of the second novel. This section brought up two issues for me.  <br /> <br />First, Rice seems to see sexuality and sexual orientation as extremely fluid. She assumes bi-sexuality to be a prevalent natural state of the human condition. In this regard she is similar to many sexual theorists. She never dwells on this however, she just assumes bi-sexuality to be normative and goes on from there. <br /> <br />Second, this leads to her bisexual characters becoming focused on the drama of relationship power dynamics. In the relationship between Nicholas and Tristan she allows the reader to see some change in the characters as Tristan moves from rebellion to submission on his own terms while she also reveals the thoughts of Nicholas as he becomes more emotionally involved as Tristan's vulnerability increases. Finally she allows two characters to change over time in relationship with each other and their interactions. <br /> <br />In the end, I still expected the plot to \\"thicken\\", for events to challenge the characters. I expected the characters to develop psychologically. In the end the second book was equal to the first, undeveloped and never reaching the level of good literature.	2004-12-04

After reading \\"The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty\\" I had to ask myself \\"What was that all about?\\"  I at first thought it would be erotica embedded in fairy-tale fantasy. I am a very sex positive and open person and yet I found this book disturbing. Let me give a short plot summary, then my theory of Ann Rice's message, and then the 3 major weeknesses of this book. <br /> <br />First, the story is pure fantasy. Beauty is awakened from 100 years of sleep by a Prince having intercourse with her. She is sent by her parents to be a sexual slave in the palace of the Prince's mother. Here she undergoes a broad range of sexual experiences but spanking was far more frequent that vaginal, anal, or oral intercourse.  There are so many spankings that the book borders on being boring and dull. <br /> <br />Second, Ann Rice seems to implicitly imply that only through complete obedience and submission can an individual fully experience sexual pleasure. What in the writings of the great sexual theorists Freud, Kinsey,, Money, Pomeroy, Masters, and Johonson would support this? The research literature would support that masochistic submissive sexual pleasure is but one of a braod range of sexual behaviors by which human beings can experience sexual pleasure. Unfortunately Rice focuses so much on spankings that she is really writing more about the sexual pleasure of a spanking than she is about masochism and submission. <br /> <br />There are three fatal flaws to this novel. First, Rice developed cardboard,one dimensional, dull characters and despite all the butt tanning they do not develop personally or interpersonally. There is no personal growth or intraspection. Beauty gains experience but no insight. That is tragic and pitiful.  <br /> <br />Second, there is no real plot. There is no historic chain of events that interact with the characters to challenge or support their character development. In Tolstoy's great War and Peace, the characters grow, change, develop while being tossedand displaced by Napoleon's march to Moscow. History and character interact in real life and in good fiction. This does not happen in this book. Characters fall into silly situations in which they become passive sex objects rather than creatively adapt to the force of history.  <br /> <br />Third, there is no justice. The book left me perplexed as to why anyone with an IQ of 10 and half a brain would allow themselves to be humilitated and physically harmed without giving somebody a black eye.	2004-12-04

Airline attendants tell frightening stories of commercial jets being mobbed by desperate South Vietnamese trying to escape before the flood of Norht Vietnamese troops overtake Saigon. US Military officers, an ambassador, and CIA field chief give their perspectives from the American point of view. South Vietnamese army officers and soldiers give another account, one of betrayal by the United States. I can certainly understand the perspectives of the South Vietnamese. They feared for their lives and the  lives of their families. The North Vietnamese forces controlled large portions of rural South Vietnam and they were ruthless to former South Vietnamese government officials and their families. This book is a very fast read, the narrative statements have been well edited into seemless paragraphs and any prompt questions by Engelmann have been removed. Our entry into the war was a terrible miscalculation. Our leaving the war was a human tragedy for all those South Vietnamese who had grown dependent on the United States. Engelmann's book puts a personal face on these tragic times. Well done and worth 5 stars.	2004-11-28

Camus does an excellent job of contrasting individual insanity and collective insanity in his play Caligula. Basically, Caligula is insane. He is a despot who holds the lives of his subjects in his hands. At times, for very arbitrary reasons, he kills or executes someone from his court. This seems arbitrary and frightenging. Yet, Caligula is contrasted against sane military officers who engage in terrible acts of war where thousands upon thousands of civilians and soldiers are killed. So who is insane?  Is it the dictator who might execute someone in his court for very trivial reasons or is it the rational military general who kills thousands and thousands of persons in rational and supposedly justified warfare?  Camus reveals to the careful reader that societal evil is far more dangerous than individual evil.  This is a wonderful thoughtful classic play that demonstrates Camus' ability to bring complex concepts to dramatic life. <br /> <br />The Misunderstanding, another play in this volume, is another complex drama. An innkeeper and her old maid daughter kills guests of the inn when they are able to discern that the guest's death can not be tracked. They rob the guests which supplements their income.  They long for the return of the beloved son of the innkeeper who has been gone for years and years without contact. As you might expect, the son returns to the inn and is murdered by his mother and sister.  The deed is revealed when his wife arrives and finds him missing. Camus here deals with the concept of objectification of others so that violence may be done to them without remorse.  When the innkeeper and her daughter find they have murdered the long lost son, they are beside themselves with grief. But yet they have murdered many innocent travelers without remorse because they have been able to divorce themselves from any thoughts that these travelers were fellow humans. A simple play with a simple point, yet it points to a terrible feature of human existence, that we can commit unspeakable horror on others once we have convinced ourselves that they are no longer human beings.  Camus recognized that prejudice kills, it is not beneign. <br /> <br />I appreciate Camus' ability to make a point without preaching or overstating. I strongly suggest this book of 4 short plays.	2004-11-28

Her primary method is that of an anthropologist, observing and interpreting her own animals. Whereas some in the scientific community would have problems with her method, we must remember that the great child psychologist, Jean Piaget, developed his theories of child development by carefully watching his own children.  <br /> <br />She challenges the scientific dogma against anthropomorphism. This is an interesting argument. Thomas argues that as human beings we interpret through a subjective perspective even though we strive for objectivity. She seems to argue for the need to increase our everyday lived understanding of animals, not obtain perfect scientific understanding of animals. There is a difference. <br /> <br />For anyone considering buying a parrot or other large exotic bird, the chapter on parrots should be required reading. I never realized all the problems and complications of owning a large bird. <br /> <br />Thomas' three most controversial essays in the book involve her belief that most dogs are \\"slaves\\"; her stand against euthanasia; and her belief that male dogs should be given a vasectomy rather than castration.   <br /> <br />My dog, Jasmine, is in love with the boy dog next door, Walter. Every time we let her out she runs to see if Walter is home and she loves to play with him inside his backyard. When I bring her back home she seems heartbroken, like a teenager in love. I always think of Thomas' assertion that we control our dogs and don't allow them to bond and remain with the other dogs with whom they have fallen in love. (I am a victim of anthropomorphism as you can tell). It makes me sad to think that we deprive dogs ofloving relationships with each other to meet our needs. <br /> <br />Another controversial essay is on euthanasia. She tells the story of an aged and sick dog that she euthanized. Later she greatly regrets her actions and comes to the conclusion that if an animal can still eat food they should not be euthanized. I am still not convinced. I think she makes a strong argument that when an animal is in too much pain and agony they will stop eating and naturally die, but the thought of an animal in constant agony is greatly disturbing to me and therefore I am not totally convinced by her concepts. <br /> <br />Her argument that male dogs should be given a vasectomy rather than castration was fascinating. She argues that vasectomy allows the male dog to have adequate testosterone in the bloodstream to allow the dog to adequately compete with other males and to be treated with respect by female and male dogs. I never realized that castration changes the smell of their urine and leaves other dogs perplexed as to the gender of the castrated male. However we also have to remember that humans have dogs castrated to stop aggressive fighting, excessive marking with their urine, neighborhood roaming, and mounting behaviors on other dogs. Vasectomy makes them infertile but does not change any of the male dog behavior patterns.  <br /> <br />Finally, I found her essay on the development of dogs from wolves to be very interesting, especially her idea that we can still observe the early man-dog social patterns in remote rural third world villages. In these villages, dogs live on the border/boundaries of the village. They alert the village to intruders. They sometimes accompany a hunt for a large animal. They survive by eating scraps and human feces (which contains undigested protein). This is certainly far from the lives of dogs in the United States with the exceptions of wild or runaway dogs which must revert to these patterns just to survive. <br /> <br />The book is short and canbe finished on a plane ride. It is thoughtful entertainment - the best kind.	2004-11-23

I give this excellent book 5 stars even though there are a few concerns I had on a few of her assertions and a wish for more detail in other areas. <br /> <br />One strength of the book is Tuchman's effort to define \\"folly\\" with a strict criteria and then compare events from history to that criteria. Basically she defines \\"folly\\" as the pursuit of policy against self-interest in the face of evidence contradicting the wisdom of the policy. Further, the \\"folly\\" must be counter-productive and the decision of a group rather than an individual. The \\"folly\\" must continue despite dissenting voices and articulated options or alternatives. <br /> <br />The chapters on the Renaissance Popes was very entertaining and decadent. Tuchman takes the reader through the papacy of Sixtus IV (from the powerful della Rovera family)who expanded the college of Cardinals to meet his policitical ends; Innocent VII who indulged his son and promoted the rise of the Borgia and Di Medici families in the papal court; Alexander VI who would have to be considered as the worst pope in history due to his total conversion of his religious office into a secular worldly power; Julius II (another della Rovera) who was a warrior pope and the patron of Michaelangelo; Leo X (a di Medici) who used the papacy for indulgence and gain of his Florentine family; and Clement VII who became the virtual prisoner of Emperor Charles V after the invasion and conquest of Rome.  <br /> <br />The story of these 6 popes is a wild tale full of murder, treachery, theft, bribery, sexual depravity, and power politics. In short, the Papacy had become a secular state during this period and Realpolitic was the driving philosophy rather than a church concerned with Christianity. Tuchman indicates that a rising voice of discontent was developing, which erupts with the resistance of Martin Luther in protest against the sale of indulgences. It ison this point that I wish Tuchman had written more. The development of resistance and rebellion against Catholicism needed more explanation and historic development to parallel the decadence and worldly pursuits of the papacy. These six popes seemed insulated to the point that only secular power politics and self aggrandizement were within their range of concerns and actions. Whereas as a group they certainly practiced \\"folly\\" in terms of the credibility of the Catholic church, they each pursued rational behaviors if survival in a world of warring states and gain from office are seen as the overiding concerns of these 6 men. The Catholic papacy had drifted away from it's Christian mission and taken on new missions more realistic for a secular state. Thus the \\"folly\\" was embedded in organizational drift. <br /> <br />The chapters on the loss of the American colonies by the British better fit Tuchman's thesis on the nature of \\"folly\\". In these chapters miscalculations, pride, and minimization of dissenting information and voices certainly led to a break between Britian and the Colonies that was initially desired by neither party. <br /> <br />The chapters on the war in Vietnam certainly document the gradual fall into this crisis over the Presidencies of Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon. Tuchman does a good job of explaining how the French had practiced unfair dominance on their Vietnam colony, setting the stage for rebellion against western domination; how DeGaul pressured the United States to support the French in Vietnam in return for France's participation in NATO; how the United States interpreted interactions in Vietnam through the prism of the Cold War as compared to the Vietnamese who saw the conflict as a war of independence.  <br /> <br />After reading all the wonderful examples given by Tuchman; what is the answer as to how to avoid \\"folly\\"?  Tuchman sees pursuit of power as a force that sets the stage for folly. Power means that the interestsof one group is advanced over the interest of another creating a competitive dichotomy of concerns and interests. Tuchman also sees vested interests contrary to the larger principles as a force that initiates \\"folly\\". Personal incompetence in persons with power allows mission drift and creates the furtile soil on which others can play for personal gain rather than collective gain. Excessive power frequently leads to disorder and injustice in many cases but a powerful central force that maintains mission goals over personal gain would also seem to be necessary. Conceptual stagnation when mental flexibility is needed also leads to \\"folly\\", primarily because adaptive leadership to new and changing conditions is absent. Tuchman gives examples of situations where policy is based on outdated principles and that when contrary information arises, the policy becomes more rigid rather than more flexible. Error is to be expected. Persistence in error is the path to \\"folly\\".	2004-11-21

This book is extremely well written. I was amazed at how well Henry Kissinger explained 300 years of Western history and diplomacy. Because the book is so well written, I would recommend it to folks interested in history, political science, international relations, or for just interesting reading of a good book.<br /><br />I found the early chapter on Woodrow Wilson's approach to American exceptionalism, which included our native idealism, collaborative successes, and mutual security and multilateral action in international affairs to be very insightful and Kissinger returns to these concepts again and again in his analysis of statescraft. Likewise in this early chapter he contrasts Wilson to Theodore Roosevelt's philosophy of action only with clear national interests in mind, a world of realpolitik.  He also explains balance of power approaches and adequately demonstrated the barriers, benefits, consequences, and downside of each of these approaches. After reading this 800 page book, I am ready to sit down and start reading again.  It is really that good.<br /><br />There are numerous highlights but I will share a few with you.<br /><br />His chapter on Richelieu and Louis XIV demonstrated how Richelieu created the first modern state to emerge from the Middle Ages. Richelieu acted to consolidate power for the French king which ran counter to the mind set of the Middle Ages. Unfortunatley, as Kissinger demonstrates, Louis XIV squanders this power with needless wars, for which his relative Louis XVI paid the ultimate price.<br /><br />One section of the book, regarding the Concert of Europe after the fall of Napoleon, reveals statescraft at the heights. Metternich and Talleyrand helped create a peace that lasted over 100 years based on realistic balance of power and alliances based on common values.<br /><br />The development of the German state under the power of Bismark compared to the downfall of France under Napoleon III was very interesting. Unfortunately the power of the new German state was misused in World War I.<br /><br />The sections on World War I demonstrated the pattern by which military decisions and preparedness outweigh and preceed correcting diplomacy. In this section Kissinger and Tuchman offer a common view of the origins of World War I.<br /><br />Kissinger and Tuchman however diverge when it comes to Vietnam. Tuckman's short crisp summary of the tragedy of Vietnam in her book The March of Folley is a very good summary, but Kissinger's chapters on Vietnam in Diplomacy certainly put meat on the bones of fact.<br /><br />Finally Kissinger's analysis of his years working with Richard Nixon were real eye-openers. Richard Nixon undoubtedly had considerable gifts in the area of foreign policy which makes the tragedy of Watergate even more sad.<br /><br />I just do not think anyone with half a brain would be dissatisfied with this excellent book.the downfall of France under Napoleon III was very interesting.

He does this by also telling the story of Jung's personal life and relating incidents in Jung's life to his psychological framework and then linking to concepts from Taoism, usually illustrated with a quote from Lao Tzu. It is of course impossible to discuss Jung without also discussing his relationship with Freud. Freud and Jung agreed that the personal complex casts its shadow on all purely logical thought. However whereas Freud would move in the direction of bringing the complex into the light of consciousness so as to alter its influence on rational thought, Jung places far less hope in rationalism and rather wishes to move toward wholeness where rationalism plays only a role among other forces in the meaning of life. If human existence is a dark mystery, Jung would ask that we light a small candle of insight and consciousness in this vast wasteland.  <br /> <br />I found the telling of Jung's life story, especially his later years of loss and illness and insight to be very well connected to the points Rosen made with quotes from Lao Tzu. Rosen makes a very strong case that as Jung moved out of the shadow of Freud, his theory of psychology became very Eastern and Taoist.  <br /> <br />The Self in Jungian psychology is the central column of the psyche and yet it is related to the eternal void. Wholeness of spirit and mind and body in Jung's thought equates with the enlightenment of Zen Buddhism.  <br /> <br />I found the tremendous resonance between Jung's thought and Taoism to be comforting and expected. Why wouldn't the thoughts of this great psychologist who was willing to incorporate spirituality into his view of wellness also be in tune with the great philosophy of the East, Taoism? It only makes sense that Jung and Lao Tzu frequently sound alike. Rosen does a good job of making this point.  I recommend the book for anyone interested in study of Jung or Taoism.	2004-11-15

Ehrenreich is totally upfront with the readers by specifying the conditions of her social experiment. She starts out with $1000 in cash. She keeps her car. She has her credit cards for backup in case of emergency. And yet even with these \\"back-ups\\" she ends up working two minimum wage jobs just to barely survive.  <br /> <br />She works as a professional maid in a maid service company. She works as a hotel maid. She works in Wal-Mart. She works in a family restaurant as a waitress. She works as a nursing home cook.  She works in Florida, Maine, and Minneapolis. Through all these experiences a common thread is developed which the reader should recognize and gain better insight into the plight of the working poor in our country.  <br /> <br />The plight of the working poor in this nation is disgraceful. They are mistreated by supervisors and customers. They must have more than one minimum wage job just to survive. Transportation and housing are barely affordable to persons in this class. Healthy care, child care, and disease/illness prevention strategies are frequently beyond their means. Ehrenreich reveals a national disgrace created by ever widening gaps between rich and poor. <br /> <br />This book is not policy analysis but it is very well written and gives the reader insights into the daily struggle for survival for the working poor. There is a social contract in the United States that if a citizen is willing to work full time, that they should be able to afford some basic level of shelter/housing, food, clothing, and transportation (public or self-owned). Ehrenreich reveals that we have broken the social contract. We have created systems that transfer wealth to the top 1% of our citizens at the expense of the bottom 40% (the unemployed poor and working poor).  This is shameful. <br /> <br />I greatly enjoyed this book even though I became angry at the lack of social justice in our society. Go Barbara Go!	2004-11-14

This book is beautifully written.  <br /> <br />The story is basically that of an aging gay male becoming obsessed with his beautiful young student. Edward Manners becomes the tutor for a wealthy high school aged fellow, Luc. At first Edward sees a thin immature youth but as the story progresses, Edward becomes more obsessed with Luc and the descriptions of Luc change to match Edward's changing perception. This portion of the story is well told and certainly accurately portrays the process of obsession that seduces gradually, obliterating common sense and good judgement. <br /> <br />Edward recognizes that he has lost his bearings when he finds himself continually thinking about Luc, spying on him when he is on holiday with his friends, imagining him having sex with other young men or women, remaining fixated as to whether Luc is gay or straight, and even leaving tutoring sessions to use the bathroom so that he can smell Luc's dirty laundry.  <br /> <br />Hollinghurst then begins to break the bubbles or desire that Edward has created. Luc becomes more realistic and less idealized. He becomes more human and more mundane. Eventually all the questions Edward has about Luc are answered, or at least many of the questions are answered. Edward begins the painful process of healing the wounds left by obsession as Luc drifts out of his life. <br /> <br />I found the book to be one of the best descriptions of the natural history of obsession since Robert Plant's The Catholic. Obsession is revealed to be a wounding, out of mind experience, from which we only gradually recover. Hollingshurst caught it well in this well written book.	2004-11-14
US	35501691	R1DO9331R1ZKYI	0679722564	570736767	The Swimming-Pool Library	Books	5	10	11	N	N	Time and class can both be priviledges	Alan Hollinghurst writes superb prose. He is a master wordsmith. In this novel he tells the story of Will Beckwith, a bright young gay man who lives for sex and intellectual stimulation. He is a sexual adventurer in the pre-AIDS era in London. He has one a-sexual/gay physician friend in whom he confides as well as a young hotel employee boy-toy with whom he has regular sex. He takes his sexual freedom and his priviledged class for granted. He meets Lord Nantwich, a gay gentleman in his 80's, and reluctantly agrees to help write Nantwich's memoirs based on his diaries written in Colonial Africa 60 years ago. Thus the stage is set for young Will Beckwith to begin to gain the insight that even though he and Nantwich were very similar in their youth, different age's interpretation and repression of homosexuality can lead to very different life choices and consequences. <br /> <br />Gay culture in 1900 and 1980 are compared in the parallel lives of Beckwith and Nantwich. This demonstrates the way gay men of younger generations may take for granted the repression and homophobia that characterized earlier periods. <br /> <br />The descriptions of the gay sex are as cooly rendered as the intellectual aspects of the book, Hollinghurst's speciality. Yet despite the cool veneer, Hollinghurst would have us see that it is the awareness, the awakening of class and time priviledge, that allows Will to become more fully conscious and more fully compasionate, and thus more fully alive.  <br /> <br />I stongly recommend this book for several reasons: it is beautifully written, it explores sexual identify over time, it is erotic, it is intellectually stimulating, it confirms the ability of human's to gain insight and moral character without becoming sentimental.	2004-11-13
US	35501691	R2NP9YBLRR6FLE	1400013933	372738500	Compass American Guides: New Mexico, 5th Edition (Full-color Travel Guide)	Books	5	12	12	N	N	A comprehensive work about a state of great beauty	The Compass American Guide series is excellent and I found the guide on New Mexico to be a great resource. New Mexico has a rich history of native peoples and Spanish exploration and colonization. The guide offers a brief but useful history of the area, including the chaotic period of struggle between Mexican and Anglos before statehood. <br /> <br />The book has a separate section on Albuquerque and the surrounding environs; a section on Santa Fe and Taos and then the rest of the book is divided into 5 large geographic areas.  This was especially useful on our trip where we spent 3 days in Albuquerque, 3 in Santa Fe/Taos and then spent the rest of the time going to more remote sites to explore this beautiful state. <br /> <br />Albuquerque is a mixture of old and new and the guide helped us navigate in Old Town as well as find our way in the suburbs that move from downtown to the bottom of the Sandia Mountains. Old Town is a shopping delight, especially if you are shopping for Native American jewelry, weavings, masks, and pottery. I found the lay-out of the central square to be very pleasing and central park allowed a place to sit and watch.  <br /> <br />We visited the Rio Grande Nature Center which offers shady walks along the river. We also visited the Petroglyph National Monument, which lays on the edge of town, and is a great hike with interesting rock drawings etched into the mountain.  <br /> <br />There are two ways to reach the top of the Sandia Crest; either in a gondola lifting you high above the city, or you can drive around the mountain and take the twisty mountain road up through the evergreen forrest to the top. We selected to take our car and the drive around the base of the mountain and through the forrest was wonderful. The views from the top are spectacular, especially at sunset. <br /> <br />We drove the back roads between Albuquerque and Santa Fe which was very interesting. Santa Fe has a tremendous art market and there are 50 or more art galleries that represent nationally known artists. The downtown museum was informative regarding the history of New Mexico. There is a museum complex on the edge of the city however that should not be missed. First there is a museum of colonial Spanish history with beautiful furniture, carvings of saints, weapons, costumes, decorative arts, and paintings. The museum is elegant and serene in design. Second is a museum of folk art collections from around the world. This museum is a must see.  There were collections of African American artists, Asian, South American, etc. The collection was extensive with thousands and thousands of items on display (I am not kidding - in one large display room with dolls from every country, there were over 10,000 items all on display). Third is a museum of the Native Americans of New Mexico. The museum was obviously designed and maintained by Native people, the displays were very respectful and educating. The restaurants in Santa Fe are superb. <br /> <br />We moved on to Taos where we visted the homes and studios of many of the artists who moved to New Mexico after World War I. The home of Oscar Blumenschien was built 250 years ago and the home contains many of his works. The Fechen museum was incredible containing many of his paintings and displaying the amazing home he built himself, carving doors throughout the home.  <br /> <br />We took a side trip to Abiquiu to go to Ghost Ranch. The terrain gradually becomes more and more red as you drive from Santa Fe to Abiquiu. When we arrived at Ghost Ranch, a very polite lady told us that the vast area had been donated to the Presbyterians. When we asked to see Georgia O'Keefe's home,she told us that someone lived there and they did not give directions so as to preserve this person's privacy. She offered us maps to around 15 hiking trails. We hiked the Chimney Rock trial high above the Ghost Ranch valley. The view from atop the mountains was spectacular and worth the drive from Santa Fe. <br /><br />We drove to the Jemez Muntains and Bandelier National Monument. This is another highlight of New Mexico. One trail in the park will allow you to see the cave dwellings of the early native people. The climb up the long wooden ladders into the shallow caves was great fun. We then decided to take a second hike after lunch and went down to the Rio Grande river, another enjoyable afternoon! <br /> <br />The Fodor guide was excellent, we did not have to buy other guides or books because so much of New Mexico was detailed in the guide. There are many maps, photographs, essays, and travel ideas.	2004-10-30
US	35501691	R3POL1ZVKMNDQ1	1400012651	81090290	Compass American Guides: Arizona, 6th edition (Full-color Travel Guide)	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Visit this beautiful state with a good guide	The Fodor Compass America Guide on Arizona was excellent. The book was uniquely organized with the first three chapters devoted to the dramatic Arizona landscape of deserts, mountains, and canyons. There are two chapters on the history of Arizona, honoring the early people who inhabited the area as well as recogizing the Hispanic missionaries, priests, and settlers. Because vast parts of Arizona belong to the Navajos, Apaches , Yavapais, Hopis, and smaller tribes, the book includes plenty of information about the native American people in this state. The book then covers the two large inhabited areas, Phoenix and Tucson. I found the book to be full of useful tips and practical information.  The maps were very good, showing the deserts, the grand canyon, the Spanish Colonial settlements, the Native American reservations, and the larger cities. Also included was a section on the desert plants.  The sections on the Grand Canyon were very helpful.  We decided to hike to the bottom of the Canyon on the Bright Angel trail. We spent the night at the Phantom Ranch (which had hot showers). The following morning we hiked back up the Kaibab trail. This was an amazing experience. The book was very helpful as we explored Frank Lloyd Wright's home and architectural school/business in Scottsdale.  This compound of buildings hugging the desert floor is worth a visit. Hold onto the steering wheel of your car on the twisting roads in the copper mining towns like Bisbee and Tombstone. I bought superb copper ore specimens - beautiful greens and blues. The Mexican atmosphere of Nogales, a border town, is nice. Nogales means \\"walnut\\" in Spanish but unfortunately the old walnut groves have long been chopped down. A special city is my opinion is the the wonderful multi-ethnic college town of Tucson.  You might be surprised at the dramatic differences between Phoenix and Tuscon. It is hard not to fall in love with Tuscon with its mixture of cultures and peoples in a relaxed atmosphere. Whereas in Phoenix you see sprinklers trying to water struggling lawns, in Tucson the inhabitants are more likely to have desert gardens which waste far less water. I found the Fodor guide to be excellent and would strongly recommend it.	2004-10-30

I found Calasso's book The Marraige of Cadmus and Harmony to be exceptional. I found two others; The Ruin of Kasch and Ka to be more difficult. These lectures are not as accessible as The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony but neither are they as difficult as Ka, with it's convoluted explanations of Hinduism.<br /><br />Calasso sees the gods as the energy behind creative thought and thus only a few lucky individuals, with blank brains, are visited by the gods. The human mind is not strong enough to bear the full revelation, but we are able to briefly receive the images offered to us by the gods and struggle to give them shape.<br /><br />Calasso seems to think that contemporary thought has diminished the god's powers. Yet he knows they are still among us, and have even been joined by a vast herd of Eastern dieties, ready to invade the European mind.<br /><br />Calasso refutes Voltaire's assertion that the gods are only fables designed by the power hungry priestly class to control the masses. Calasso sees myths as archtypes, patterns, that reveal themselves to men rather than as imply stories invented by men. With sadness, he points out that for a period of 400 years they remained alive mainly in the paintings of Boticelli, Rembrandt, Poussin, and Tiepolo.<br /><br />The gods not only permeate the arts, Calasso points out that it is myth that holds a people together in community. This attests to myths enduring power over us as a society.<br /><br />As Nymphs, the gods survived in the visual arts and emerge in such modern masterpieces as Nabokov's Lolita.<br /><br />Calasso discussed Nietzsche's phenomenological concept that the sciences, and all forms of knowledge, are models of reality, are simulations. This is the the connection between art and science. They both are approximations of reality. Whereas science is forever in flux, being proven and disproven, but remaining useful; art has immediate impact.<br /><br />The image, the archtype, the vision must have form and this is the job of the artist. In poetry it is the meter. Calasso quotes Proust on the role of structure in giving body to the spirit of inspired thought. Calasso concludes with the concept that three actors are involved in the creative process, the hand that writes, the voice that speaks, the god who watches over and compels. This is related to the ego, the self,and the divine; all of which must mediate the creative process.<br /><br />Though he quotes Jung only once, I found many of these concepts to be present in the works of Jung, Joseph Campbell, and the essays of Iris Murdoch on the nature of the arts. Calasso challenges the reader's intellect, sometimes leaving us adrift due to his vast knowledge base, but always I found gems of unique insight and fresh interpretations of philosophy and literature.art has immediate impact.<br /><br />The image, the archtype, the vision must have form and this is the job of the artist.

US	35501691	R38DJWICD9OWNI	0789493896	669537653	Paris (Eyewitness Travel Guides)	Books	5	21	21	N	N	Essential for the first time traveler to Paris	The DK Eyewitness Travel Guide for Paris is a perfect product for the first time traveler to Paris. I have used it the last 3 times I was in Paris, but I found it most useful on the first trip. It also makes great reading before going to Paris. Read it on the plane!  <br /> <br />The historic chapters are brief but essential to understanding the history of France and the city of Paris. This is especially helpful in uderstanding the revolution and the Bourbon restoration after Napoleon I under Louis XVIII and his younger brother Charles X, followed by their cousin Louis-Philippe I and the take-over of government by Napoleon III. <br /> <br />Medieval Paris is still present in Paris at the Louvre, Notre-Dame, and Sainte-Chapelle. Sainte-Chapelle is not easily accessed and the guide helps you find your way to the entrance of this Gothic jewel. The guide has a special section on Sainte-Chapelle, the first Gothic structure, with its thin columns holding up beautiful glass walls of red and blue. <br /> <br />Renaissance Paris can be found in the wonderful Place Royale (Place des Vosges).  This space is amazing, and continues to be used for housing and shops after 400 years. Within Place des Vosges is the Victor Hugo Museum, showing his apartment furnished with his original furniture. Just relax in the central courtyard. <br /> <br />The guide color codes the various Quaters of the city, offering the highlights of each section of the city, along with suggested walking routes. This helps the travel orient to the book while walking and also helps avoid the naggig problem of missing a point of interest while nearby.  <br /> <br />A full 22 pages is devoted at the beginning of the guide with an extended time-line showing the history of Paris and offering tips on sites to visit to capture various eras in the city's history. I found this especially useful in understanding the grand transformation of the city under Napoleon III and Baron Haussmann in which avenues and boulevardswere widened, and the city became more accessible with broad grids and multiple spoke-like intersections. Because of this design, traffic jams are rare. When traveling, a slow-down on one street can be rectified by simply moving over one street. Travel patterns in the city are infinite. <br /> <br />The guide is well illustrated, with photographs, maps, drawings, charts and tables, all of which help the traveler orient and enjoy.  <br /> <br />Because many travelers are in Paris only for a couple of days, the guide highlights the cities main tourist attractions and gives these sites ample explanation: Sainte-Chapelle, Versailles Palace, Pompidou Center, Musee d'Orsay, Eiffel Tower, Jardin du Luxembourg, Musee du Louvre, Notre Dame, an the Arc de Triomphe. <br /> <br />The guide includes a map of the metro system, which is inexpensive, convenient, and quick. However, be careful of pick-pockets at the metro stops at the major tourist sites. The gude advises you to buy a book of 10 metro rides at once for a cost saving. If you plan on being in the city long, this is a good idea. <br /> <br />There is a general subject index that is very thorough. For example, there are 17 entrys under Victor Hugo; 6 for Jean-Paul Sartre; and 24 for Pablo Picasso.  <br /> <br />The maps at the end of the book were excellent and worth the price of the book. The street finder allowed you to orient yourself quickly if lost. The street finder was great for finding obscure addresses. We found the studios of Paul Braque and Nicholas De Stahl in hidden neighborhoods.  <br /> <br />We had to use a taxi because we were late for a concert. The city is not taxi dependent like New York and Barcelona and thus taxis are harder to catch and more expensive. The bus routes are well marked and whereas they take longer than the undergound metro, you certainly see more of the city from a bus.  <br /> <br />The guide helps explain the train system. I have come into Paris from Madrid, Brussels, and left Paris for Amsterdam and Frankfurt. It is important to know which train station to use. For example when arriving from or going to Amsterdam and Brussels you must use the Gare du Nord. When going to or arriving from Spain, you must use Gare Montparnasse. When going to or arriving from Frankfurt, you must use Gare de L'Est. you are in big trouble if you assume all these stations service the same destinations. The guide helps you sort this out so that you can use the train system in Paris conveniently. <br /> <br />The guide even tells you about the public toilets in Paris, which are conveniently located but the city needs far more of them. They are inexpensive and the entire little bathroom is washed down with sprinklers between users. <br /> <br />The street markets in Paris are wonderful and the guide tells you how to find the various markets. There are great cheese buys which you can take back to your hotel room to enjoy during your stay. The Passages are worth visiting for covered shopping. Walk down Rue du Faubourg St. Honore at least once to see the Chanel and Hermes flagship stores. <br /> <br />The guide also offers five guided walks. There are other books on this topic that offer many walking suggestions. This is one of the few weaknesses of the book, more suggested walks would be great.  <br /> <br />As you can see, I found this guide to be fantastic, full of detail and pictures and maps. If I  could give it six stars, I would.	2004-10-16
US	35501691	R1XZ7UD2V35FGV	087685479X	159371697	Let it Come Down	Books	5	10	14	N	N	Bowles' Masterpiece is a frightening tale	I am a total Paul Bowles fan and this is the crowning masterpiece of his career. I wish I could give this novel 10 stars rather than just 5. Whereas Sheltering Sky and The Spider's House are totally excellent, Let It Come Down moves beyond them into the territory of the totally blank driftless soul with no meaning, a situation that Bowles shows is the most dangerous of all states of the soul.  <br /> <br />The basic story is that of an American average young man, but beware, he is about as average as the frightful vapid drifters that populate the novels of David Plante. In fact the protagonist of Plante's The Age of Terror is similar to Bowles' protagonist, Nelson Dyar. Nelson Dyar comes to Tangier Morocco in the 1950s to work for the son of a friend of his mother's who runs a travel agency that is involved in illegal currency transactions. A plot is hatched to scam the currency exchange and Nelson is the fall-guy. But beware the fall-guy with brains and no soul. He meets a young prostitute, Hadija, but they don't fall into love, they fall into driftless sexual obsession with no  future or commitment. Hadija is also pursued by an obese alcoholic ill-tempered lesbian heiress. One of the most vivid scenes in the novel is when this lesbian, Eunice Goode, goes to a cocktail party for Americans and Europeans hosted by two successful Morrocan businessmen. She drinks too much and passes out,in her long evening gown, on the walk leading from the patio, thus requiring every guest to step over her rotund sloppy mass of fat flesh to reach their cars to exit the party. Yet Eunice is only one of numerous characters of low intentions and lost expectations.  <br /> <br />The parade of low-life Westerners may be a commentary on the value systems of the modern sophisticated American and European consciousness in comparison to the world of North African Islam. But I think there is more being said here. Nelson goes beyond the simple greed and lust and ego-centered schemes of the othercharacters and enters the world of total amorality. He moves beyond greed and into the world of the emotionless and thoughtless killer. <br /> <br />This supreme work of existentialist terror is embedded in a novel of beautiful spare poetic language. Nelson is no witty clever antisocial Ripley from a Patricia Highsmith novel. He is far more empty, a Zen murderer, a driftless pointless danger.	2004-10-14
US	35501691	R3DGWCFB6QJ0XX	0876855451	681889975	The Spider's House	Books	5	10	10	N	N	The Huckelberry Finn of Islam	I strongly recommend this novel, written in 1954,yet totally alive and relevant to the contemporary reader. I was amazed to see Bowles capture the essence of the clash between the Islamic world view and the Western modern view in such a fresh and insightful manner.  <br /> <br />The novel is about the final days of the French occupation of Morocco after World War II. The story is told through the eyes of an American expatriat, Stenham, and then through they eyes of a 15 year old Islamic young man. Stenham, a tired and disappointed writer, has seen the false promise of modernism, and thus is sympathetic to the Moslem determinism and process of living life embedded in faith. Amar, the Moroccan youth, also see those members of the Moroccan nationalists movement, Istiglal, who would use religion for political gain. <br /> <br />The story moves from luxury hotels and modest Moslem homes, to street fights and riots, to Islamic ceremonies high in the Moroccan mountains, to the cafes where Europeans gather to experience a world far different from their own, to the lairs of the subversives who plan to drive the French from Islamic lands. <br /> <br />Like Mark Twain's Huckelberry Finn, the world seen through the eyes of youth allows for fresh observations of the familiar  world. Amar is the Moslem Huckelberry, trying to make sense of Europeans and countrymen in a struggle for power. <br /> <br />Yet it is the cultural interaction between modernism and Islam that Bowles captures perfectly. Bowles paints a realistic, honest, sympathetic vision of the Islamic world. The image reveals the weaknesses and barreness that modernism brings. I recommend this book strongly, especially in these times of conflict between the Western world and the world of Islam.	2004-10-13
US	35501691	R1GTYV4MQV0DUP	0880015829	318982614	The Sheltering Sky	Books	5	7	9	N	N	There is no shelter under this dark sky	I regret that Bowles never won the Nobel Prize in Literature for he surely deserved it. Sheltering Sky is poetic and beautifully written. Bowles weaves both dream and fable into the fabric of the novel also. Sheltering Sky is an exceptional existential novel that tears the veil of illusion for the American consciousness in much the same way that Sartre and Camus did for Euro-centric consciousness. The title is a supreme irony, since the sky does not shelter us, the blue is illusion, the darkness is the reality. The characters in the novel carry all the illusions and arrogance of Western civilization with them into a Muslim country and step by step the illusions are stripped from them, challenging their relationships, identities, health, and lives. Bowles is the master at revealing personal identity as a social construct, a fragile collection of illusions and memory and attachments. Bowles sees this personal identity as extremely vulnerable when put under pressure and in Sheltering Sky a rich arrogant well-educated couple are put into the pressure cooker of the Arabian desert. <br /> <br />It is a story of loss and adjustment to loss. For example, the protagonists, Port and Kit, have a shell of a marriage and have fallen out of love. They enter the stage partially dealing with this loss. They struggle and never recover. Bowles carefully paints them as selfish, aggrogant, rich, spoiled, intellectualizing, Western-centered folks who actually represent a large portion of the American upper middle and upper classes. Are these characters likeable? Not really, but do we read because we want to \\"like\\" the characters? Rather, Kit and Port are real characters, we feel ambiguous about them, and we shiver as they lose their thin veneer identities under the assaults of contracting cultures and extreme challenges of the natural world.  <br /> <br />Port and Kit travel to Morocco where they must struggle against a vast and hostile nature and a foreign and unfamiliar culture. Then,step by step they lose every illusion which sustains their flimsy identity. They are forced to confront their mortality and Port does not pass the test. Kit's final situation is more ambiguous. She loses her mind, she becomes the slave concubine of a nomadic camel driver, she is rescued and returned to an oasis of Western culture, yet she escapes back into the dessert. <br /> <br />Bowles is the master at stripping away fantasy and illusion, revealing the amazing fragility of human existence and meaning. This is one of the finest novels of the 20th century with so many painful lessons to absorb.	2004-10-09

The book is a little heavy to carry around in your hands but fits nicely into a backpack. The book is full of colorful photographs and drawing and is extremely user friendly when trying to find your way around Barcelona. The book contains area maps where you can orient yourself to particular neighborhoods and the sites. Also suggested walking tours are included with well detailed maps. There are also larger excursion maps should the traveler wish to leave the city for such wonderful sites as Montserrat with it's cliff hidden Monastery and mountain hiking trails. <br /> <br />There is a brief history of Barcelona and Catalunya. I suggest reading it so that you understand why the high school Spanish you learned is not quite appropriate here in Barcelona, an area that considers itself culturally and linguistically separate from the rest of Spain. There is a tension between Madrid and Bracelona and understanding the history helps the traveler enjoy and appreciate Barcelona even more.  <br /> <br />The parks located on Montjuic, overlooking the city, can be accessed by bus or climbed for those in good shape. Nestled in the park is the wonderful Miro Museum, comprehensive and interesting. The useum is primarily devoted to the vast works of Joan Miro but other artists are displayed, especially if the work is compared to Miro's styles.  <br /> <br />Parc Guell, designed by Gaudi, in all it's colorful whimsical fantasy is captured. The amazing mosaic tile work on benches, bridges, columns, buildings throughout the park make it very visually stunning and unique. Don't miss Gaudi's Casa Batllo, the most odd house imaginable. The roof tiles are like fish scales, the balconies are shark jaws, the wall are covered with coral and starfish patterns. It is if a giant fish had been turned intoa multistory home. You have to walk across the street to appreciate the structure. The giant structure, La Pedrera is at least 8 times larger than Casa Batllo and evokes caves and moon landscapes. There is no way to describe La Sagrada Familia by Gaudi. It seems like a Disney world structure gone amok. The Gothic architectural details burst into fruit and vegetable clusters, with cold gray limestone contrasting against loud bright pastels.  <br /> <br />The city life of La Rambla, the main artery of Barcelona, is a site of constant entertainment. From early morning to late at night the streets are active. The residents of Barcelona eat dinner so late that even at midnight the side-walk cafes are full of merriment. Trees line the street so you will protected from sun-burn as you stroll up and down this main street of the city.  <br /> <br />The Gothic Neigborhood, the oldest part of the city, is well described with a detailed map. In this neighborhood is the ancient Cathedral with its wonderful lush interior tropical garden. Stop and rest in the garden which is like a miniture Brazilian forrest, misty, cool, and dense with color.This courtyard is very different  from the nearby wide, dry, hot Placa Reial with it's Gaudi designed lampposts. Within the Gothic neighborhood is a suggested walk that is highly recommended since it takes the walker to numerous Roman artifacts and structures on which Bracelona was constructed. Next to the Gothic area is La Ribera, a wonderful area, full of ancient buildings and shops,as well as the Museu Picasso, containing a fantastic collection of Picasso's work. Nearby is the Parc de la Ciutadella, a wonderful place to stroll and relax before visiting the Museum in the grounds of the park to see the city's collection of art from a range of eras and styles. North of the Gothic area is Passeig de Gracia, a more business like atmosphere similar to Paris. Here is located the Antoni Tapies foundation with a collection of Tapies' work as wellas a small temporary exhibition of contemporary artists. <br /> <br />A visit to the church of Santa Maria del Mar reveals the beauty of a Gothic austere brickwork church that impresses with the power of the brick and stone alone. Within the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya,located high above the city, an amazing collection of early Christian images can be found. The flat Byzantine style is powerful and entertaining. <br /> <br />There are great seafood restaurants on the waterfront as well as nightclubs and strip joints with male and female strippers working the bars in an area called the Rambla de Mar and the Maremagnum. From the waterfront you can climb a tower and get into the cable car, Teleferic Aeri, and cross the entire city and end up in the high parks above the city. Near the waterfront is Port Vell with its gigantic iron column topped by Christopher Columbus looking toward the West.  <br /> <br />The book ends with suggested excursions, the primary one of which is a short train ride North of the city to Montserrat. Here you must go by cable car to reach the little mountain town of Montserrat. Within the church is the mysterious Black Virgin. Also available are wonderful hiking trails in the mountain overlooking the vast plane toward Barcelona and the Mediterranean Sea. The guide book is highly recommended for its great suggestions on walks, maps, sites and background information.	2004-10-05

I could not stop reading once I opened the book and read the book all night. I finished the book at 5 am and had to walk around the campus until the sun rose to sort out my impressions and thoughts. This book was very meaningful to me and influenced my future. Thirty years later I re-read the book before giving it to my nephew who is in college.<br /><br />The novel is basically a beautiful well written long parable. The setting is 14th century Germany during the plague years of the Black Death. A young man, Goldmund, is taken to a monestary by his merchant father after the death of Goldmund's beautiful mother. Here he is treated with kindness by Brother Daniel even though he gets into conflicts with the other students. He meets a fellow student, Narcissus, who is a contemplative seeker of God, enlightenment,and spiritual contentment. Through this friendship Goldmund calms down and is eventually recognized by Father Anselm as having potential.<br /><br />However, after having intercourse with a young married woman outside the monastary, Goldmund must go into the world to seek truth, beauty, adventure, sex, and eventually the discipline of the arts. He becomes an appretice with a master artist, Master Niklaus, and creates a sculpture of the Madonna that allows Goldmund to fully express the loss of his mother and capture the beauty and grace of the feminine.<br /><br />As is the case with most good parables, the book can be understood in a wide range of interpretations. The classic Apollo/Dionysius duality from classical studies is definitely present. Narcissus takes the path of Apollo, toward light, God, reason, contemplation, reflection, insight, enlightenment. Goldmund takes the path of Dionysius toward the truth and call of the body, the lessons of earthly pleasure and pain, the sacrifice of the body in work and sexuality, the search for truth and the creation of beauty.<br /><br />There is another interesting way to view this parable. I thought that the life of Goldmund demonstrated the role of the son, lover, and sacrificial victim in relationship to the mother, consort, layer-out White Goddess archtype. The role of the male is defined in relationship to the various relationships a male has with females in his life. Thus the contrast is not between Narcissus and Goldmund but between Goldmund and the eternal feminine. He dreams and grieves over his lost beutiful mother and wishes to regain her presence and love. He becomes a lover of many women in many different relationships. He creates the sigle work of sculpture that allows him to build in real matter the archtype he has followed. He finally returns to the monastary and dies with visions of returning to the feminine manifestation of God.<br /><br />If I could control public school education, I would have every child between ages 12-14 read Mark Twain's \\"Huckelberry Finn\\", every young teen between 14-16 read Harper Lee's \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\", every teen between 17-21 read J. D. Salinger's \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" and every young adult 22-26 to read Hesse's \\"Narcissus and Goldmund\\".<br /><br />I say this because the duality between the characters of Narcissus and Goldmund is a duality that young people feel in the depths of their soul. they ask: Do I seek God? Do I seek beauty? Do I find myself in sexual experience? Do I find myself in contemplation? Do I create and what do I create?<br /><br />Narcissus and Goldmund shows these paths, the rewards and costs of following each, and the final resolution of these paths..  <br /> <br />There is another interesting way to view this parable.

US	35501691	R2LPIKMCD3AS0Q	0140186956	456745371	Kolyma Tales (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)	Books	5	68	69	N	Y	Torture does not purify me, it destroys me.	Varlam Shalamov's style is minimal, brutal, and straight-forward. He does not preach to his reader about terror, torture, death, and injustice. Rather, he describes the horrible experiences he endured in short stories that are far more like eye witness narratives than the typical short story. He does not need to tell you that cutting off a man's hands is a terrible crime, he just describes the actions and allows the reader to absorb the impact as they read the cold, hard narrative. Life in Kolyma had no frills and lace, and neither does Shalamov's narrative style.<br /><br />I think this book would make excellent classroom reading and discussion for high school seniors. I say this primarily because of the exposure to the Soviet system of social control, especially between 1936-1956. Understanding totalitarianism and social control should be part of our education of our youth. I also think that Shalamov counters the concept that suffering is redemptive. Rather, Shalamov indicates that extreme hunger, torture, work, beatings, exhaustion, cold, and experience of arbitrary death and injustice gradually destroys any human being, depriving them of uplifting emotions, imagination, creativity, and finally empathy and a sense of self survival.<br /><br />Shalamov carefully demonstrates this loss of our humanity under conditions of extreme torture, exhaustion, hunger and cold by showing character after character disintegrating in unique but common ways. In general, empathy and sympathy are gradually dissolved in the horror of their experiences and are replaced by a depressed apathy. Rarely does he show the downward spiral to go from nobility to criminal cruelty. Rather, his characters become devoid of emotions, both positive and eventually even negative, before they give up.<br /><br />In the story \\"Condensed Milk\\" one prisoner trys to get other prisoners to attempt escape so he can inform on them and get special treatment from the guards. In \\"Shock Therapy\\" a disgusting young egg-head physician trys to identify \\"fakers\\" in the first aid clinic with electric shock. In \\"The Lawyers' Plot\\" a Soviet official trys to arrest a whole social network of law students based on social contacts rather than evidence and eventually is arrested himself. \\"Typhoid Quarantine\\" was my favorite story. A man who has survived the gold mines is returned to camp dkuring a typhoid quarantine. Through some basic reasoning and knowledge of the Kolyma \\"system\\", he is able to survive in the camps and at least temporarily avoid the killing gold mines. In \\"The Lepers\\", persons who have leprosy are able to hide amongst the frost bite victims and victims of Warld War II injuries. In \\"Committees of the Poor\\" a great description of the social norms amongh the prisoners is described. In \\"Major Pugachov's Last Battle\\" a daring escape from the camps is told. In \\"Lend Lease\\" a terrible tale is told of American bull dozers being used to dig mass graves for the millions of frozen dead laborers. In \\"An Epitaph\\" Shalamov writes short paragraphs about people who may not need a whole short story for their tale of horror and death, but none-the-less needed to be related in a stream of consciousness account of misery of the common prisoner. In \\"In the Bathhouse\\" we learn that efforts to control lice and parasites are totally ineffective and are actually demeaning totures for the inmates.<br /><br />We will never know the exact number of persons who died under Stalin's Soviet experiment. Conservative figures reach 22 million citizens of his own country. Shalamov at least gives us a true accouting of his horror and allows many of the dead to at least be enobled through a story.  This book should make us sad at the true nature of human existence and how a social system can be designed to make our darker nature the dominant feature. Knowing this fact, and knowing that we can not change human nature, we are compelled to design social and political systems of public discourse that do notallow this horror to erupt and overtake us.t do not allow this horror to erupt and overtake us.	2004-09-26

Her first chapter on Graves' biography filled in gaps for me that were not present in \\"Good-bye to all That\\", Graves' major work regarding his World War I experiences.  The role of myth, particularly that of the White Goddess was fully documented but Graves resistance to archetypal interpretations of myth needed futher exploration. I understand his reluctance to interpret myth and religion within a Freudian reductionist determinist framework, but Graves is just as resistant to an expansive Jungian framework. I think this is because Graves found ever flowing fountains of images and associations within ancient ritual, myth, religion. To him, even the Jungian interpretation would be limiting.  <br /> <br />The chapters on Hebrew mythology, the Nazarene Gospel Restored, and King Jesus were fascinating examples of iconoclastic scholarship at its best. We will rarely see such brilliant, scholarly, original thinking again. I want to try to find the Nazarene Gospel Restored so that I can read the final chapters which is Graves' re-telling of the Christian gospels. <br /> <br />Snipes' best interpretations were of the Claudius novels, that were actually studies in male and female acquired power. Like many World War I veterans, Graves was firmly convinced of the corrupting influence of power. Even Augustus and Claudius, two well meaning rulers, were corrupted by power, lead astray by those who sought power, or were shaped and molded by the powerful and forever bore the scar.	2004-09-19
US	35501691	RV36G9U663GEB	0679743839	225576240	Barcelona	Books	4	25	26	N	N	Beautiful city, scholarly book	I visited Barcelona in 1982 and then again, 20 years later, in 2002. I am certainly glad I read Robert Hughes' \\"Barcelona\\" before going the second time since it certainly gave me a new perspective on the city, its history, its art, and its architecture. <br /> <br />The history of the Catalunya area is fascinating, an area that predates the Roman Empire. Two Roman Emperors came from Barcelona, Trajan and his nephew Hadrian. Hughes helps us understand the unique development of the Catalan language, culture, history which is frequently at odds with Madrid and Spain's central government.  <br /> <br />Hughes does an excellent job of mapping the development of city with changes in politics and the coming of the industrial revolution. At one point, Barcelona was filled with sweat shops, offering long 12 hour days, very low wages, unhealthy nasty work conditions, deprivation of exercise and light, and explotative child labor. As I walked the city of Barceona, I imagined the struggling families trying to survive under these conditions in times past. <br /> <br />Even though the full 574 pages are engaging in this long book, the chapters on Gaudi are the strongest, most enjoyable, and most insightful. If pressed for time before taking a tripto Spain, I would strongly recommend reading the sections on Gaudi before seeing his actual works which are spread out all over the city of Barcelona. <br /> <br />The concept that was fascinating to me was Hughes' explanation that Gaudi's work was in fact very conservative rather than radical. His work is based on a return to the natural object, the shell,the wing, the tail, the spine, the leaf, the root. His work takes these natural objects and reduces to essential form and then expands again from that essential form with texture, color, and sensitivity to the material and physicality of the medium. This explains the amazing popularity among the Japanese for the work of Gaudi, which philosophically and esthetically is more in line withJapanese culture and esthetics.  Knowing this before seeing his Cathedral, parks, and residences gave me a completely new appreciation for Gaudi and the city in which he created his masterpieces.	2004-09-19

I read it first in 1973 when I was in psychology graduate school and I was 22 years old. I was a young seeker of truth and the book was perfect for me at the time. I read it a second time in 1982 when I was taking a course on Buddhist imagery in Asian art history. I read it a third time in 2001 when I bought it as a present for my college age nephew and wanted to read it again before giving it as a gift. I think it is a masterpiece. When I was 22 it served as a guide. When I was 50 it confirmed the path.<br /><br />The story parallel the life of the Buddha, who was also named Siddharta. The story is the classic journey, both outward into the world and inward into the soul. Siddharta is reared in wealth and priviledge and yet like many insightful persons, recognizes that this is a fragile and illusory reality and social class construct. He breaks with his father, an act that all of us must underdo to became truely individuated adults. Gifted with male beauty, intelligence, and warm charism, Siddharta makes his way into the world. He joins wandering ascetics and masters hunger and cold. He becomes a hedonist and lover to a beautiful woman while becoming a successful merchant. These were not wasted years. In fact, Siddharta learned deep lessons in his soul through his love-making. He learns the mystery of becoming one with another body during passion. But he also learns that worldly sexual love fades and attachements are hard to break. He becomes a ferryman, gaining wisdom from the tides and river banks.<br /><br />This book is a masterful union of Eastern mysticism and the psychology of Carl Jung. It does not identify or endorse a particular path. Rather it endorses the thoughtful and experience laden journey of life, a natural process of growth and loss, attachment and release. Written as a short parable, it can be read in one evening but I feel sure you will remember it for a lifetime.	2004-09-19

As he lays back in the tatoo artist's chair, he changes personalities with a 10th century homicidal maniac Roman Catholic priest. The 10th century priest thinks that he has died and that the two nude tatoo artists are devils torturing him in hell. The story gets more and more crazy from that point on. Anger toward the anti-abortion movement with the Roman Catholic church seems to be the motivating factor behind this book, but I found that the book was full of odd-ball humor and dark dry wit. If you are a Roman Catholic, you will probably find this book very offensive. This is a shame because Disch actually writes very skillfully. I think he is underestimated as a writer. Underneath all the anger is thoughtful social commentary, bitter irony, and masterful use of the English language.	2004-09-18

I found Daniel Weinreb to be a 21st century Holden Caufield, from \\"Catcher in the Rye\\". Life on the inner city edge also reminded me of Denis Johnson's \\"Jesus' Son\\".<br /><br />Disch's future America, a politically divided nation of secular excess on either coast, divided by a conservative theocracy in the middle, is almost too real to be funny.<br /><br />On another level the book is about enlightenment and Daniel's efforts to reach nirvana, where the soul becomes a fairy and zones out for centuries contemplating electric motors. Daniel is also totally devoted to his young wife as she lays in a coma while her soul flits and flirts around the  world in a state of ecstasy which he only imagines (until the final pages of the book).<br /><br />Someone needs to make this classic science fiction work into a movie. Colin Ferrell or Matt Dillion would both do a great job playing Daniel in his quest to leave conservative religious middle America and not only escape to less repressive societies but also to experience the state of being a fairy, divorced from the human body and in a state of perpetual enlightenment.	2004-09-18
US	35501691	R2S51QQ2O80YTI	0374516642	555329729	King Jesus: A Novel (FSG Classics)	Books	5	88	93	N	N	A scholarly alternative approach to the life of Jesus	Having grown up in an Episcopalian family in the Southeastern US, I am very familiar with Christ the Savior from St.John's gospel and the epistles of Paul. Graves offers the viewer two alternative interpreations of Jesus in his book,King Jesus. These two alternative views are based on Hebrew concepts of a political/military messiah and the mystery religion of the triple goddess, which requires the sacrifice of the goddess's consort to bless the land and people with his sacrificial blood. There is  no doubt that these two world-views, religions, concepts were dominant in the Mediterranean Roman world. For example, St. Paul's epistles strongly condemn the mystery religions of the triple goddess, which he identies as Artemis (also known as Diana in Roman mythology). <br /> <br />I realize that my many fundamentalists Christian friends would find this book disturbing but I would invite them to read this exceptional historic novel to gain more insight into the Hebrew concept of a worldly military messiah destined to overthrow Roman domination or the concept of the consort of the triple goddess, destined to be sacrificed for the well being of the land and people. <br /> <br />First, the book is a political novel about the efforts of the Hebrew leadership to bring about the birth and development of a young man to be their military leader and savior. Jesus is the son of Mary and Herod's oldest son,Antipater, hidden in the home of Joseph until the time he will arise as the Hebrew ruler. Graves was a scholar of Hebrew religion and he brings his considerable knowledge of the Hebrew faith to the novel. Graves writes of a possible plot wherein the birth, schooling, and mentoring of Jesus were all part of a Hebrew plot to produce the Messiah that would defeat the Romans and bring about a Hebrew golden age of 1000 years. <br /> <br />Second,the book is a novel about the struggle between the patriarchial religion of the Hebrews and the cult mystery religions of the triple goddess,or the white goddess. This ancient religion has as the central deity a female goddess who is mother/birth, wife/consort/fertility, and death/destroyer. Graves has Mary the mother of Jesus, his cousin Mary (sister of Martha and Lazarus), and Mary Magdalene playing these roles. However, in the religion of the triple goddess or white goddess, a male plays the role of son, husband, consort, king, and finally human sacrifice to this triple goddess. Graves has Jesus move from the role of warrior king of the Jews to sacrificial king through the novel. Whereas Mary the mother of Jesus is a player in the Hebrew plot to support Jesus as the military Messiah, his wife and cousin Mary asks him to use his powers to raise his cousin (her brother) Lazarus from the dead. Jesus does this act but because he must now offer God a life for a life, he must offer his own life for that of Lazarus.  This puts Jesus directly in the power and plot of Mary Magdalene (the layer-out) who requires the sacrificial death of her husband/consort to bless the world and its people. Graves was probably the foremost expert on the religions of the triple goddess and his scholarship helps maintain the internal consistency of the novel. <br /> <br />Finally, we are left with the question of whether Jesus' crucifixion was a triump of the feminist mystery religion of the triple goddess over the Hebrew messiah or whether Jesus' cruicifixion spelled the doom of the triple goddess as he emerges as the Christian savior. <br /> <br />Graves, an expert on Hebrew religion and mythology, classical history and mythology, and the canonical gospels as well as the Gnostic gospels, is certainly the scholar best suited to try to bring all this together in a fascinating historic novel consistent with the society and theology of the times. Graves was a highly creative and independent thinker and I have no doubt that this book will disturb my fundamentalists Christian friends - none-the-less it is a wonderful description of the world into which Jesus was born and the two major east Mediteranean religious philosophies that competed with Christianity at the time of his death.	2004-09-18
US	35501691	R4MURZ96D8C80	0670032646	621157776	American Dynasty: Aristocracy, Fortune, and the Politics of Deceit in the House of Bush	Books	5	31	31	N	N	Required reading before the November election	Before reviewing this exceptional book, it is important to point out that Kevin Phillips was an economic advisor to republican president Richard Nixon, served as a White House strategist under Republican leadership, and wrote the prophetic book: The Emerging Republican Majority that predicted the rise of the Republican party.  His Republican and conservative credentials are top of the line, yet he warns the people of the United States of America about the current Bush administration and traces policy and power brokerage back multiple generations in the Bush and Walker families. <br /> <br />Phillips documents the rise of the military-industrial complex in this country and links the Bush family deep in this web of political international influence and foreign policy development. <br />The descriptions of war profiteers, such as the DuPonts, in World War I and II are contrasted with the considerable amount of war profiteering that is present in the Bush and Cheney families.  <br /> <br />Phillips points out that years of wealth and priviledge have inclined the Bush family to moral arrogance and disregard for the democratic and republican tranditions of the U.S. government, a frightful indictment.  <br /> <br />The Bush family has undergone a miraculous change from Episcopalian yankee blue-bloods in the banking and investment fields to evangelical born-again Texans, a shift that mirrors demographic and political power changes in this country. Phillips poins out the dangers inherent in foreign policy shaped by the Book of Revelations. George W Bush managed the Evangelical Fundamentalist Christians through his father's campaign and presidency. His political skills must never be underestimated because George W was able to out manueveur both Jerry Falwell, Gary Bauer, and Pat Robertson to become the head of the religious right.  <br /> <br />The power base for the Bush family has been the internaltioan reach of US investment banking (Prescott Bush and Herbert Walker)domestic energy sector (Enron), the drive for US control of global oil supplies, defense industries (Halliburton),the Pentagon and the expansion of the military industrial complex, and the growth in the CIA an other intelligence operations. In addition, tax breaks for the investor class and the upper income groups ensures a loyal voter block. <br /> <br />Investment in petroleum businesses is linked to the Bush's preoccupation with investment, capital gains taxes, and tax shelters.  <br /> <br />Though Geroge W Bush distances himself from the Enron catastrophy that resulted in billions of dollars of loss to share holders as well as billions of dollars of loss to employees and former employees with the collapse of the 401 (k) programs heavily invested in Enron, the fact remains that Enron support for George H.W. Bush and Governor George W. Bush of Texas has been prolonged.  <br /> <br />I found the sections on George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush to be very informative. George H.W. Bush used wealth and social priviledge to gain access nad power in the Richard Nixon administration and became a favorite of the Ford administration, being promoted to the head of the CIA. <br /> <br />Phillips follows a similar pattern in American Dynasty to the strategy he used in his class book: Wealth and Democracy.  Whereas in Wealth and Democracy he traces parrallels between the Spanish Empire, the Dutch trading Empire, and the British Empire to current US domestic, economic, and international policies; in the Americn Dynasty Phillips makes connections between the restoration of the Bourbons in France and the Stuarts in England. All this is interesting, but not really essential. The sections on the rise of George H.W. and George W. were frightening enough.	2004-09-14

Whereas I, Claudius was about survival without power; Claudius the God is about survival with power. This point is very well made as the parallel careers and lives of Claudius and Herod Agrippa are intertwined. Herod Agrippa and Cladius were close friends. Herod had been raised in the household of Octavia Caesar, Claudius' mother and sister to the Emporer Caesar Augustus. Claudius eventually realizes that the clever, witty, charming, light-hearted persona that Herod Agrippa presented to the royal court of the Julio-Claudians was in fact his shield and mask that hide his ambitions and aspirations. Claudius hide his intellect, wit,and insight behind his stutter and limp but because of his friendship with Herod, he learns late that Herod also had a mask. Yet, even though the rebellion of Herod, as king of the Jews, hurt Claudius because of their years of friendship; it was Herod who never betrayed Claudius at court, never revealed that Claudius was brighter than generally percieved, and gave him the best advice possible \\"Trust no one\\".  <br /> <br />There is no other wasy to describe Claudius' marriage to Mesalina except to say it was very messy. Love is certainly blind and Claudius almost loses his life to the manipulative and treacherous young wife with her thousand lovers. Mesalina was a mess. <br /> <br />Graves documents that he used multiple sources other than Suetonius' Live of the Twelve Caesars. Suetonius wrote a hundred years after the reign of Claudius and thus had a republican axe to grind against all the Julio-Claudian family. Graves is far more sympathetic and balanced in his telling of the life of Claudius.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed I, Claudius in a different way from Claudius the God. Graves was able to capture Claudius the survivor in a treacherous family in I,Claudius.  In Claudius the God, there is more maturity and sad reality about the limitations of human life and aspirations.  <br /> <br />They both are superb and must be considered two of the finest historic novels in the English language. Graves' use of the English language is perfectly beautiful and I found I quickly read through both novels, thorougly entertained by every page.	2004-09-04

Murdered and Deified A.D. 54 (Vintage International)	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Thank goodness my grandmother was not Livia	Robert Graves' \\"I, Cladius\\" is cetainly a masterpiece on several levels. The book is a wonderful work of historic fiction that entertains from cover to cover with a lively story of the treacherous Julio-Claudian family. The book is also an excellent example of Graves' method of \\"channeling\\" the personalities of the past into the present by emersing himself in the historic records and then allowing the missing pieces to emerge as he writes. Finally, the book is a wonderful lesson on survival. Claudius during the reigns of his treacherous relatives and Elizabeth I during the reigns of her younger brother and older sister have much in common. Primarily both Cladius and Elizabeth had to work to hide their brillance in a world where it was best to be underestimated.  <br /> <br />Claudius' grandmother Livia must be one of the most interesting characters in fiction or non-fiction. As a young woman with two small sons, she left her Senator husband to marry the young Emperor Caesar Augustus. She remained his most trusted, shrewd, intelligent advisor and partner until in old age she poisons him.  She is ruthless, impatient, controlling, manipulative, ambitious, and extremely insightful. She eventually is able to penetrate Claudius' public persona, which is that of a bumbling fool. Claudius was a clumsy cripple, with a nervous twitch. He also stuttered and drooled. All of this made him appear to be a fool when in fact he was extremely intelligent and cunning. Claudius is at most risk when his grandmother Livia finally sees how bright and cunning a survivor he really is. <br /> <br />The character of Caesar Augustus is wonderfully developed. Imagine Lyndon Johnson married to Leona Helmsley and you have an idea of the dynamic duo of Augustus and Livia. Augustus is charming and persuasive to his will, the consumate leader and politician. He is extremely wise, listening to Livia analyze and deconstruct every policy and its implications. Yet he is fully human, loving his family, even as Livia destroys them one by one. In the end, after Augustus' family has been destroyed and murdered by the forces of Livia, he remains in control even though his life forces and joy have been gradually destroyed. This is a perfect example of the parasitic nature of Livia. She destroys all those who are close to Augustus and love him. Augustus is the source of her power and she does not want to share that power with anyone, his grandsons especially. Yet as she brings about the tragic end of his family, she causes the poor man to spritually shrink. As he nears death, she ensures that she is totally in control of Tiberius, her eldest son, and a monument to perversion and abuse of power. <br /> <br />The chapters on the insane reign of Cludius' nephew Caligula are beyond belief.  Whereas Tiberius is dangerous and cruel, he is not insane. Caligula is just as dangerous but he is less predictable due to his insanity. Also, to increase the terror, Tiberious was not especially fond of Claudius, whereas Caligula liked his uncle and thus poor Claudius was continually in harm's way in the court of Caligula.  <br /> <br />I could write page after page on the wonderful characters in this story.

US	35501691	R1ANEIGJVFMU8O	034538623X	484061988	The Guns of August (Modern Library 100 Best Nonfiction Books)	Books	5	7	10	N	N	A well written tragic history that has become a classic	Barbara Tuchman's Guns of August is a superb achievement. I would strongly recommend it to historians and those curious about the initiation and maintenance of a war of epic foolishness and wasted human life. <br /> <br />Tuchman points out that the origins of the war were numerous but that considerable evidence exists that the military planning and deployment process on all sides over-ran and dominated the policical diplomatic statemanship of all parties involved. Once military deployment began, weak and ineffective statemanship could not stop the thunder roll of young men willing to die for this senseless misunderstanding. This is a view similar to Henry Kissinger in his book Diplomacy. Kissinger and Tuchman's analyses have much in common. Kissinger reveals that Bismarch was able to build a modern strong German state that was wasted in a senseless war after his death. Both Tuchman and Kissinger point out that convoluted alliances between Germany and Austria, blindlessly followed upon the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand and his wife Sofia, created a domino effect. Germany responded with horror that a Slavic revolutionists would assassinate a Germanic Prince and even though Bosnia agreed to all conditions prior to invasion, the Austrians decided to invade to recover pride. This act was viewed with contempt by the Russians who wished to come to the aide of their Slavic brothers and their entry pulled France, then England, and finally the United States into the vortex. If anything, Guns of August would warn all nations not to rush into war. <br /> <br />Both Kissinger and Tuchman point out that the American Civil War was the first modern war in which amazing technical fire power totally over-powered those that used the machine gun technology and those that fell under it's aweful power. There is very little evidence that any of the European military leadership studied the American Civil War and the tremendous loss of human life to the machine gun technology, a technology that they would implement without new strategies for infantry in the face of these killing machines. <br /> <br />Remember that John Kennedy at the time of Cuban missle crisis had Barbara Tuchman's Guns of August as a warning at his bedside. There is a reason this book is a text book at West Point. Every President should read this book and analyze the very slippery slope of public sentiment, prejudice and misplaced patriotism, and our amazing ability to fool ourselves and underestimate our enemy.  <br /> <br />In Robert Grave's Good Bye to All That, we see that this war destroyed the rigid class system in Europe, as aristocracy drove first the peasants and then their own sons into the mouth of death. The aristocracy of the European nations were immediately made officers and the serf and farmers were enlisted men who had to follow the orders of the upper class inexperienced fools. Tolkein honors this patterns in the character of Sam in The Lord of the Rings, the loyal helper and valet who stands beside his better, Mr. Frodo.  <br /> <br />At the Mercedes museum in Stuttgart, I saw the Mercedes Limo that drove Kaiser Wilhelm around Amsterdamn after the fall of Germany and his forced abdication. I wondered if he ever knew the tremendous loss of human experience that resulted due to his poor statemanship, oversized ego and paranoia. <br /> <br />The war centers around the Western Front and the German effort to sweep around the front, through Belgium, and onward to a quick victory in Paris. It is the invasion of Belgium that pulls the English into the struggle. But we must also not forget the terrible war crimes committed by the German troops upon the common citizens of Belgium and northern France. I found myself repeatedly angry at the military and national leadership on all sides, for they seemed caught in quicksand. Before they came to their senses, an entire generation of young men were destroyed. <br /> <br />But if anger is what you need to read, try DaltonTrumbo's Johnny Got His Gun. In the end Tuchman recognizes that human insight is extremely limited and the ability to see several steps of consequences is beyond most human comprehension. This is particularly true if military rank is a result of class rather than ability.  <br /> <br />England and France remained politically intact after the war, but German began the steps into dark Nazism while Russia began her steps toward Bolshevism. The Czar and his family were killed, the Austrian emperor was forced to abdicate as did Germany's Kaiser.  <br /> <br />Tuchman would not support Lenin's assertion that World War I was a result of capitalistic societies at war over trade and profits.  <br /> <br />The war began August 4th and by August 29th there were 260,000 French deaths.At Waterloo an infantry soldier couldifre twice a minute. The machine gun fired six hundred rounds a minute. The Wesern Front stretched for 475 miles with 10,000 soldiers per mile. The front consisted of 3 trenches sometimes separated fromt eh other side by less than 10 yards. The trench system, defended by machine guns in trenches could only be overcome by assault, a horrible stategy. Artillery was suppose to open up the path through the trenches but was dismal at this task. In the summery of 1916 more thatn 50,000 British troops died walking into German fire, without advancing the front by a single foot. I am so sad when I think of 8 million young men, ages 17-20, dying in the blood and mud, because of diplomatic entangled miscalculations, erroneous intelligence, and manipulated nationalistic patriotism. <br /> <br />I can not recommend a better book on World War I than Tuchman's Guns of August. No doubt there were multiple contributions to this tragedy, but man's lesser nature and cognitive limitations certainly carry the lion share of causation.  <br /> <br />	2004-08-24
US	35501691	R3V0NNDHJPY1PF	0312420277	278415393	The Feast of the Goat: A Novel	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Superb political novel with lessons beyond the Dominican Rep	The Feast of the Goat is a superb political novel. Leo Tolstoy's War and Peach; Gore Vidal's Lincoln; and Robert Grave's Claudius the God are the only three that I think are better. You can see that I hold Llosa in great esteem.  <br /> <br />The novel is perfectly written, moving from the lives of victims of the Trujillo dictatorship, to the experiences of his fearful and terrorized courtiers, to the horror of his torture victims, to the hopeful energy and spirit of the conspirators who eventually assassinate General Trujillo, to the crafty political moves of President Joaquin Belaguer to save the nation. <br /> <br />General Rafael Trujillo was a primal evil force, who equated his own health with the health of the nation. His worthless brothers and sons terrorize the common people, much as the family of Sadaam Hussein did to innocent Iraqui citizens. Trujillo was as evil as Stalin, he just never had the opportuntity to kill as many folks as Stalin. <br /> <br />The chapters written from the perspective of Trujillo were chillingly brilliant, showing how absolute power and penetrating paranoia can be combined into a monster who destroys all those around him, including the most brillant thinkers in the nation. <br /> <br />The chapters written from the perspective of Trujillo's terrorized civil servants sound like the terrible experiences of the Roman aristocracy under Tiberious, Caligula and Nero. Wives are raped while their Senator husbands are in session, and all the victims keep silent because to protest would mean the deaths of the entire family. <br /> <br />The chapters written from the perspective of the assassins were sad beyond description. After the May 30, 1961 assassination, the Trujillo loyalists extracted a terrible bloody revenge on the families of the conspirators. <br /> <br />I thought the novel was exceptional in the way it described the abuse of absolute power and the crippling effect this has on those that surround the power. However, the novelgoes to great heights with the description of President Joaquin Belaguer's efforts to save the nation after the reign of terror of the Trujillo family. In the same way that Talleyrand saved France after the fall of Napoleon, President Belaguer does a masterful job of moving the Dominican Republic out of bloody chaos and into the light. Both Talleyrand and Belaguer might be seen by immature or less experienced readers as Machivellian manipulators, when they in fact have the fate of the nation in their hands and their manipulations are for national stability rather than personal gain. Belaguer out maneuvers the greedy wife of the General, his daughter and two dangerous sons, his two mobster brothers, the heads of the corrupt secret police, and the US Ambassador. Like Vidal's Lincoln, power is seen from multiple perspectives - all of which rang true.	2004-08-17

They are minimally written and appear to be influenced by the Beat writers. Johnson is also a poet and his beautiful use of language sparks up the stories of drug binges and car accidents. <br /> <br />I worked in a methadone program for 9 years and many of the hair-raising stories told to me by addicts are reflected in similar stories in this book. Drug addicts trying to function in the world while intoxicated and hallucinating; make love; fight; double cross each other; run from the law; and exhibit reckless life with little regard for consequences. Yes, these are full blown sociopaths! Yet, throughout the book, Johnson rewards us with his minimal style and his poetic imagery. Despite the accidental deaths, drug overdoses, double-crosses, and despiration; the beauty of the world continues to haunt the characters, like a ghost, that enters the world as a smoky dream.  The text moves from stark objective narration, to dream-like states, to drug induced hallucination. There was one scene where two drug addicts who work in an emergency room are caught in a snow storm. They see a graveyard with all the markers the same size and then realize they are car-mikes in a drive in theater. The film is playing through a snow storm to an empty parking lot. The description Johnson evokes is haunting and beautiful. The story \\"emergency\\" is frigtening and funny and sounds only all too true regarding health care in America. <br /> <br />The film Trainspotting reminds me of this book. The death of the baby in Trainspotting while all the junkies were getting high is very similar to what you will read here.  <br /> <br />The narrator's search for the beatiful in deformed or crippled women reminds me of the photography of Diane Arbus. While photographing the deformed, retarded, disabled; Arbus found the beauty of the person and tried to capture this beauty in her photographs. She reportedly had sex with many of her models. Johnson follows a similar pattern as he describes a dwarf woman with beautiful eyes or a spastic paralyzed woman who raises her twitching arms and curses out of the side of her mouth when she has orgasm.  <br /> <br />I think the book was entertaining and jolting. I find the lives of people on the edges of sanity, society, and sobriety as fascinating because I think how my own life would have been if I had become a dope addict or alcoholic or professional thief. At some point, some of the characters have had enough of the low-life, but they are the exception and are very few and far between. They are usually persons who love dope addicts and finally have had enough. Even the narrator tries to come out of the dreamy world of crisis in the final story. He describes the sober world as silly yet healing; boring yet ultimately beautiful.	2004-08-15

Barker's WWI historical novel has Robert Grave, Seigfried Sassoon, WHR Rivers, and Wilfred Owens as characters in a British army hospital. Graves is a minor character, but Sassoon and Rivers are the main characters. My curiosity about Robert Grave's impressions of his WWI experiences lead me to Goodbye to All That.  <br /> <br />By the time Graves had written this book, he was 35 and was living with Laura Riding, his literary muse and lover. Yet he does not mention her in the book. Rather he concentrates on the disasterous British school system that he endured as a child and young man, his expereinces in WWI, and ends with the downfall of his first marriage to Nancy Nicholson (the mother of his 4 children) and his teaching position in Egypt at the University of Cairo. Nancy was a socialist and feminist and eventually she drove Graves away. This is so odd considering that Graves was totally sympathetic to matriarchial power structures and devoted much of his writing nad poetry to the White Goddess. There is no White Goddess to be found in these pages however, which is so odd considering his fascination with this topic throughout his poetic and literary career. T.E. Lawrence was a friend of Graves and gave Graves the copywrite to four chapters of Pillars of Wisdom for publication in the USA. This allowed Graves additional income to support his writing career as well as a large family. <br /> <br />The sections on WWI are the highlights of the book. Robert Graves enlisted at age 19 and became an officer due to his social class. He is seriously wounded and his family is told he is dead but he rises from this condition to regain his health. He meets the poet Siefried Sassoon during this convalescence. He also meets Dr. WHR Rivers, the famous neurologist, psychologist,and anthropologist. Rivers introduces Graves to the concepts of the relationships between dreams, myths, poems, andcreative imagination, an area of interst for Graves all his life. In the passages on WWI, Graves cooly relates a world wide nightmare and catastrophy. His cool wit and irony distance the reader somewhat from the horror and terror. He describes mutilated bodies with a dry factual style. This cool matter of fact chronological presentation is damning in the extreme of the European leadership that lead the world into this bloody stalemate.  <br /> <br />For a hot blooded version of WWI I would recommend Dalton Trumbo's Johnny Got his Gun in addition to Grave's cool and analytical matter-of-fact tone. I would also recommend Tuchman's Guns of August for a chronoloical explanation of the war. I would also recommend Pat Barker's WWI trilogy: Resurrection, Eye in the Door, and The Ghost Road. <br /> <br />Grave's factual clear headed narrative reveals the illogical disaster of WWI that killed one in three of Grave's school mates. Graves relates how upper class officers brought servants to war yet as the war progresses a whole generation of males, both the working class and the aristocracy of England, are killed. WWI shattered the class system of the 18th century and cleared the ground for the modern era.  <br /> <br />What is Graves saying \\"goodbye\\" to? He is saying goodbye to his youth, his first marriage to an early feminist, to old Europe and its rigid class structure, but most of all to illusion.	2004-08-09

We were all very impressed with this painful and insightful book. The basic story of Joe Bonham enlisting in WWI, going to France, and having his eyes, mouth, ears, nose, arms, and legs blown off will make you shiver with dread and horror.As he comes out of his morphine coma he gradually realizes step by step that he has lost senses, mouth, and limbs and is being fed with a feeding tube in his throat. His heroic efforts to make sense of his black, soundless world and communicate with the outside world attests to the abilities of the human spirit and reminded me of the story of Helen Keller in The Miracle Worker. Yet people knew there was a person inside blind and deaf Helen Keller. Poor Joe is just seen as a mindless tragic piece of convulsing meat.Yet he makes sense of his world gradually by paying attention to footsteps, staffing patterns, and sunlight's warmth on his body.He gradually understands the night shifts and day shifts and the staff that work on them. He can now count days. He eventually communicates with the outside world through Morse code tapping of his head on his pillow. He then dictates an amazing anti-war outburst to the outside world. <br /> <br />The final section on war is fine writing. Yet this final chapter does not stand in isolation but must be considered as part of a whole parable about the horror of war. In the end, unjust wars can not be fought if young men are thoughtful and practice reasoned judgement. I think Trumbo is aware that young male idealism, lack of vista, lack of experience, mind fogged by testosterone, and unwillingness to think outside the locker room pack is the raw material of war. Men who are 17-24 fall for it every time. When they reach 30, at least for the thouhtful male, the justification for war must go beyond propaganda, slogans, and leadership spewing patriotic slogans while filling their pockets with war profit. I would give this book to any young man 17-24 to read to open their eyes to the critical judgement they must practice in the world of informed public discourse. <br /> <br />The book is written in the context of WWI, a senseless war brought about by paranoia, misplaced nationalism and non-reflective patriotism. The leaders of WWI lead their nations into war with false pretense and erroneous information. Once involved, the war dragged on and on, destroying an entire generation of young men in the quicksand of foreign aggression based on propaganda and poorly documented facts. I think you see my point.	2004-08-06
US	35501691	RX8L2BANU5RGJ	0385285906	654371748	Love and Will	Books	4	127	130	N	N	Eros transforms us	I read this book in graduate school in 1973 and then again 30 years later. When I was a young man I had not had enough experience with Eros to understand the book. I knew I wished to do great deeds but I did not know the source from which these thoughts emerged. Now, in the second reading, I recognize the forces of Eros in my past and present and recognize the need to integrate the daemonic or shadow to fully harness these forces.  <br />  <br /> The central thesis of the book is that Eros, the life force, directs our Will toward our highest potential. Rollo May asserts that hate is not the opposite of love, apathy and disinterest is. The opposite of will is not indecision - but rather May sees it as detachment. May's central thesis is that Eros (Love) is the fundamental energy behind Will. Eros is the force that drives men to seek God. Eros is the spirit of life and is not to be confused with the sex drive. Rollo May points out that the sex drive seeks satisfaction and release of tension whereas Eros drives us outward. Much of the first half of the book carefully explains the similarities and differences between the sex drive and Eros, the life force. Primarily May sees sexuality as a drive reduction process, similar to the learning theorists Clark Hull and James B Watson. Eros, however, is the creator, forever reaching out, seeking to expand. As Paul Tillich says &quot;A movement from the potential to the actual&quot; and &quot;vitality is the power of creating beyond oneself without losing oneself.&quot; Eros is the power from which we do not want release but rather to be prolonged, to form the world. Eros drives us to go beyond ourselves, to transcend ourselves, to reach ethical goodness, to seek truth and beauty. May connects his theories to St. Augustine, Freud, Maslow, Joseph Campbell, and Plato; all of whom belived that love is the fundamental human experience; pervades all our actions, and is the deepest motivating force. Freud further believed that all civilizations are created by the disciplining and re-direction of the forces of Eros. Rollo May, the therapist, points out that the task is not only to recognize our own power but to recognize the self aggrandizement that accompanies all human endeavor in this realm of power and love. May is similar to Jung in the concept of recognition of the shadow or daemonic as a guide to the self as well as a path toward integration and concentrated power and life force. Referring back to Harry Stack Sullivan, May points out that we can only love others to the extent that we can love ourselves. What is it like to be someone who has harnessed the power of Eros? May quotes Hegel: &quot;Socrates, like all heroes who cause new worlds to rise and inescapably the old one to disintegrate was experienced as a threat; what he fought for is a new form which breaks through and undermines the exisiting world.&quot;  <br />  <br /> I think the reader may find that the works of Joseph Campbell and Carl Jung further inform May's thesis. I strongly recommend the book to those who study mythology, philosophy, and psychology.	2004-08-02

The book transformed me. I went from page to page recognizing that Roger's spoke directly to me and the way I experienced my relationship with my inner self and soul. This book review is written with the purpose of encouraging others to read this masterpiece of psychological theory. ALL psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors, and social workers should be intimately familiar with Rogers and his concepts.<br /><br /> Of all the personality theorists and practitioners of psychotherapy such as Jung, Freud, Fritz Perls, Albert Ellis, Karen Horney, Harry Stack Sullivan, Eric Fromme, and Rollo May; Carl Rogers is the one infused with optimism and a belief in the goodness of mankind. He sees human beings as capable of vast growth and creativity; able to achieve ethical and loving relationships and encounters; and achieving a healed and healthy soul that directs us toward others and the world.<br /><br />Do not confuse his discription of the state of psychological health with that of William James, Clark Hull, or James B Watson. These theorists see man's natural state as homeostatic, neither alert nor asleep, neither happy nor sad. Rogers on the other hand would assert that the Buddha-like state of homeostasis is not full psychological health. Full psychological health is involvment, attachement, love, relationship, creativity, fulfillment, achievement, and goodness.<br /><br /> Once the reader buys into Roger's Self Theory, which posits that we are self healing, self directed, and instinctively know psychological health from psychological disease; then he posits his therapeutic model by which the therapist facilitates the process whereby a client moves toward this wholeness. This method, client-centered psychotherapy, transformed the world of psychotherapy, education, medicine, and social services.<br /><br />The book gives a very thorough and insightful look at how Roger's developed his theory. There are connections between his self theory and Christianity, but these are implicit rather than explicit. Then, further into the book, Roger's explains the method he developed that seeks to facilitate personal growth. The method is not intrusive but faciliates the natural growth process of the client rather than takes on the world-view or paradigm of the therapist. The method is ethical and has minimal opportunity for destructive practices by the therapist,if practiced as Rogers describes.<br /><br />When you read this book you will understand why Carl Rogers is the most beloved of all the personality theorists. The phenomenologists who have examined Rogers believe that Rogers creates reality by facilitating the loving, healthy self in the soul of his clients. Well, if Rogers has created such a loving and affirming conception of mankind, then my hat is off to him for creating such a profound reality. I believe the existential-phenomenological concept that reality is a social construct but I must honor that Roger's has in fact created a beautiful, internally consistent reality with his theory of the self.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed by this life changing book.and insightful look at how Roger's developed his theory.

The book is relatively long but I found every page of high interest.  <br /> <br />Mary Matalin's sections on the Bush re-election were wonderful reading and I am an avowed liberal. She perfectly captured the patrician nobility of Bush Senior and the campaign that destroyed itself.  From the disasterous reign of John Sununu as Chief of Staff, the tragic death of Lee Atwater, the paralysis of Margaret Tutwiler, the insanity of Ross Perot, the mean-spiritedness of Patrick Buchanan, the shrill defeatism of Rich Bonds, and the often confused and muddled voice of an out of touch President, George Bush, the characters are vividly drawn and almost sympathetic.  <br /> <br />Carville on the other hand is masterful in his analysis of the consciousness of the American Everyman. The strength of Carville's strategy is common sense played offensively. He respects the middle class American sense of irony and skepticism trying to move toward optimism and problem solving.  <br /> <br />Even though the book is 478 pages long, it is really a fast read. Both Matalin and Carville are witty, strategic professionals with years of experience. I didn't get the book to read a sappy love story and I was glad the book focused on the considerable professional experiences of this couple rather than on their fledgling romance.  <br /> <br />Carville's desciptions of Bill Clinton do the man justice as a flawed but brilliant leader. Matalin's desciptions of George Bush do the man justice as a man who believes his class, gender, and race was destined for leadership but he just can't navigate the reality of the average American experience.  <br /> <br />Where both Matalin and Carville converge is in their perspectives on Patrick Buchanan, a mean hateful old man, and Ross Perot, a crazy old man. <br /> <br />Besides a blow by blow detailed story of the Clinton vs. Bush campaigns from beginning to end, thebook is full of political wisdom and strategy.	2004-07-26

The book traces the evolution of the Hermes archatype through various periods of archaic to classical antiquity.<br />Hermes is presented as the giver of gifts that can be used for good or evil in the story of Pandora. Brown points out that early myths reveal the box to be full of multiple gifts, which could be true gifts or curses depending on the way they are used.<br />He is also presented as the cunning infant who steals his brother Apollo's cattle and then is so witty when discovered that he angers neither Apollo nor thier father Zeus.<br />He is sometimes pictured as the common man, the merchant and then at other times as the beautiful brother of Apollo, patrons of male beauty and athletics. Apollo and Hermes often shared altars in Greek cult religion.<br />His image is the garden statue complete with erect phallus and smiling face. These statues frequently were blocks with a Hermes head emerging from the top and a phallus emerging from the side. These ancient Hermes images were in every garden, every crossroad, every front door entrance. He was the god of boundaries and crossing boundaries and thus his image must honor every crossroads. Trickster, merchant, thief, he is the god of the marketplace where tribes meet and trade. He is the messenger of his father Zeus and also the god who transports the dead into the underworld.<br />I would recommend this book to students of classical antiquity. It was not entertaining enough for the casual recreational reader.	2004-07-14

Bush's America	Books	5	51	59	N	N	You must read this book before you vote in November	Molly Ivins and Lou Dubose have offered America an amazing gift in this excellent, well documented book on the destructive policies of the current Bush administration. The book is based on well documented facts. The book is also organized by topical chapters so that Bush's mean-spirited and greedy policies can be revealed and documented in depth. <br />Ivins and Dubose link Bush's failures as a governor to the failure he has been as a chief executive. Bush claims to be a sucessful businessman prior to running for governor of Texas. However financial rescue after rescue by his father's wealthy friends and associates account for the fact that this man was not a total failure. They document how ENRON has consistently supported the political career of Bush, even if he now distances himself from that travesty. The ENRON employees were not allowed to trade the shares in their 401(k) and lost 1.2 billion whereas the top executives conducted insider trading and made off with 1.1 billion. You do the math! We have to ask ourselves, has the SEC now been strengthened to ensure this type of fraud doesn't destroy family savings and retirement in the future?  You can bet you bottom dollar that the SEC will remain weak with Bush in the White House. <br />I will never eat deli meat again after reading how Bush policies have weakened USDA inspection of cooked meat products. I invite all Bush supporters to eat a healthy sandwich of smoked turkey and Listeria. When they emerge from the hospital, they can thank their President.<br />After 20 years of discussion and compromise, worker guidelines on ergonomic injury were finalized in the last days of the Clinton administration. These guidelines were the first to be gutted by the new President Bush. <br />In 1995 Newt was successful in defeating the Superfund legislation. Industrial polluters were required to pay for their own clean-up until Newt successfully overturned the program. Now the fund is running out of money and pollution clean-up will have to be paid by all citizens from the general fund. With Iraq to pay for, do we really think this will happen?<br />The tax cut for the wealthiest citizens seems to have created a jobless recovery.  Ivins and Dubose use the statistics of Republican economist Kevin Phillips to back up their chapter on the disproportionate benefit this tax cut had on the top 1% of US citizens and the continued economic fall of the bottom 80% of Americans.<br />I was amazed to read that when efforts were made to investiage off-shore accounts to investigate terrorism funds, the corporate tax dodgers called on Tom Delay to come to the rescue. Even national security should not stand in the way of tax evasion for the rich republican campaign donors.<br />The No Child Left Behind sham is revealed to be a disaster. Texas schools quickly learned how to manipulate the system to hide deficiencies and waste precious classroom time teaching students the answers to standardized tests.<br />The fact that Bush's foreign policy is shaped by fundamentalist Christian dogma is freightening to the extreme. <br />Thank goodness for Molly and Lou's witty comments that allow the reader to remain transfixed as they read disaster after disaster to the American people related in this MUST READ text.	2004-07-09

The world of Dionysian mysteries, possession by Bacchus,and ritual murder are as murky as the mystery religions themselves. However, I was struck  at the parallels between The Secret History and F Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby.  The narrarator, Richard Pappin, a-sexual and bright, mirrors the narrarator in Gatsby. Both are outsiders and both work their way into an inner circle where secrets destroy. The characters of Daisy in Gatsby and Camilla in Secret History, are pulled between two men. In the case of Daisy, she is pulled between her husband and Gatsby. In the case of Camilla, she is pulled between her twin brother with whom she is having an incestuous relationship and Henry, the star intellectual student. The gay Francis and the a-sexual Jordan in Gatsby both open doors for the narrarators into a world they wish to enter. Finally both novels are marked by two murders, all four are sacrifices to arrogance and priviledge.<br />One chapter was totally amazing to me. The chapter on Bunny's funeral seemed to strike some readers as boring but I found it to be full of the darkest humor about the human condition. It reminded me of a Patricia Highsmith short story inserted in the middle of the novel. The murderers of Bunny are invited by his parents to stay in their home and attend the funeral.  Richard observes the family move in and out of grief, so perfectly drawn by the description of Bunny's father grieving over Bunny while playing with a small grandchild.<br />A fascinating book that is highly recommended. If you are a Great Gatsby fan, you must read this book.	2004-06-12
US	35501691	R2LEBYM9A6PELF	0674518586	630928892	Leadership Without Easy Answers	Books	5	23	25	N	N	Exceptional from start to finish	I read this book in 1994 when it was first published and then again recently. It is excellent and establishes a philosophical approach to leadership that is grounded in problem solving rather than visionary mission. The visionary hero is a threat to democracy as evidenced by such leaders as Adolph Hitler and Napoleon Bonaparte. Ronald Heifetz draws a portrait of the leader that is far different from the heroic leader who tries to convince society of easy answers and moves people to action through prejudice and stereotypes.  The modern leader takes actions that allow people to adapt to challenge so as to survive. The modern leader recognizes that social problems are embedded in history, custom, special interests, and competing interests. This leads to the two analogies that Heifetz employs to draw a picture of his model. The first analogy is that of the balcony and the dance floor. Heifetz says the leader must emerse themselves in the lives and challenges of the people, experience the chaos and competing interests. They must dance on the floor. However the leader must also leave the dance floor and go to the balcony where they may observe the pattern of the waltz and thus reflect on the direction that the community/society is taking and how this may be adaptive or dangerous. The second analogy is the image of the pressure cooker. The leader must apply enough pressure to bring people together to solve problems even if they have competing interests and ideas. There must be enough pressure to bring people to the  negotiation table and to keep them at the table while at the same time keeping the pressure from building to the point of blowing up. Adaptive leaderships is far different from visionary leadership. <br />I especially enjoyed the sections on informal and formal leadership and the way these two forms of leadership may join forces to move society to more adaptive strategies. The example of LBJ and MLK was masterful. <br />In some ways this book does support greatmen ideas of leadership in that there is considerable talent needed to reflect on adaptive strategies needed for societal survival and progress, bring opposing forces to the negotiation table, and play roles of informal or formal leadership.<br />In other ways the book supports challenging times approaches to leadership theory in that challenging times call for societal adaptation, never an easy step for any society to make. <br />If you come to this book with the idea that leadership is imposition of ideology on the masses; if you think Ronald Reagan or Lenin were great leaders, then this book is not for you. Leadership is messy business because it means solving real difficult problems in a world of conflicting interests.<br />If you come to this book with the idea that leadership is based in the ability to motivate the masses with slogans and simplified answers to complex problems; if you think George W Bush is a great leader, then this book is not for you. Social problems are complex and slogans and simple answers only increase the complexity.<br />Franklin Roosevelt would stand out as the type of leader that Heifetz would identify as adaptive and successful in his leadership. He moved a broken nation out of the depression and he moved an isolationist nation into a just war against Hitler. Both required that he reflect from the balcony and maintain the pressure on the pressure cooker without creating an explosion.	2004-06-12

The term &quot;mid-life crisis&quot; would not be a term Hollis would use, because he sees the conflicts and disturbances that happen at mid-life as wonderful warnings that new directions are needed to achieve a meaningful life. He compares the depression, the loss of energy, the unexplained anger, the flare up of passion, as earthquake type pressures that give evidence of the rumblings below. <br />He compares the magic thinking of children, to the heroic thinking of young adulthood, to the more realistic thinking of the second adulthood. It is during this second adulthood that we must recognize what behavior patterns we bring from our early family of origin and whether those patterns have become maladaptive rather than adapative. He asks us to be aware of emotional outbursts or unrealistic passions of any type that signal that an unresoved complex still directs us emotionally and may be blocking our growth. He asks us to be willing to go into the luminous darkness within to seek answers, after all, by midlife you should have seen enough of the world to know that answers rarely lie outside of ourselves. <br />I enjoyed the poetry of Tennyson, Rilke, and Kazantzakis that he uses throughout the book. I especially liked the linkage to Tennyson's Ulysses, a poem that honors the fact that Ulysses' greatest adventures happen after mid-life. <br />Hollis believes the greatest tragedy during the midlife crisis is to remain unconscious and never examine the illusions, concepts, complexes, and dark shadows within us. After all, as we reach mid-life, this is the last chance for a meaningful life. The meaningful life is a higher goal that the happy life for both Jung and Hollis. <br />Hollis links his concepts to the ancient Greek dramatic concept of the tragic flaw. This flaw is usually unconscious and eventually brings the hero to ruin, at which point, his eyes are opened and he sees beyond theveil of illusion under which he has acted. <br />Hollis would say that the meaningful midlife is one in which ego needs are met and the ego becomes a tool, not an ever hungry brat requiring constant feeding. The wise adult uses the ego to achive a meaningful life, but does not have to achieve fame and fortune to feed this bottomless belly. The complexes are identified when unexplained or unwarranted anger and passion occur. After all these are just sign posts of an inner strategy failing to operate as it did back in childhood. The shadow has been accepted so that one's faults are put in perspective and do not weigh one down day after day with guilt and flashbacks and recriminations. This gives us the strength to go into the final years where one by one we lose all those whom we have loved and eventually they will lose us. <br />Jung asks &quot;Are we related to something infinite or not?&quot; and he defines life as a luminous spell between two dark mysteries. Coming through the mid-life crisis allows us to personally answer these thoughts and concepts.	2004-06-12
US	35501691	R1GGL8GK63ZZEJ	0375705163	247994375	Forbidden Colors	Books	3	18	21	N	Y	We are defenseless against beauty	This dark tale, full of twists and turns, is the story of a successful 60 year old novelist who decides to seek revenge on the women who have betrayed him in love over the years. He selects as his weapon a beautiful young gay man. Whereas this sounds somewhat like Miss Havisham's revenge on males through the beautiful Estella in Charles Dicken's Great Expectations, Yuichi is far more vacant and far less a noble character than Estella. Estella recognized that she had been reared to be a beautiful monster and thus spurns Pip, the man she loves, and marries a monstrosity of a bully rich boy. Yuichi on the other hand marries a 19 year old girl and makes her life miserable by his nightly cruising in the underground Japanese gay scene. The attraction of age to beauty, the very defenselessness of humans in the face of overwhelming male beauty, the power of eros to undermine reason and wisdom, resonated with Thomas Mann's Death in Venice. The jungle dog-eat-dog world of the underground gay nightlife in Tokyo reminded me of the unsavory bitchy queens in Jean Genet's Our Lady of the Flowers, which fully describes the post-war gay underground in Paris. The book was full of homophobia, especially self destructive internalized homophobia. Gay characters are miseable, catty, competitive, and self-destructive. However Mishima makes his heterosexual characters just as miserable when faced with beauty that they cannot obtain. Mishima's writing style is unique, his use of language superb and shocking at times. However, as I finished page 400, I decided that the book could be shortened to 200 pages and possibly be an improved work of art. Even though the plot line shows how beauty is used as a weapon, the philosophical discussions throughout the book would indicate that it is in human nature to lose reason when faced with overwhelming beauty. The novelist in the story never achieved this kind of beauty in his work, but he certainly knows how to manipulate this beauty to seek revenge.The women on whom he seeks revenge however are totally unsympathetic, as is almost every character in the story except Yuichi's young wife, Yasuko. The characters are trapped together in a vast web of relationships and bonds, appearing more and more pathetic and vapid with each destructive incident, yet fully illustrating how Eros makes fools of us all.	2004-06-05
US	35501691	RT3QFLB0GJK5P	0809001608	598990781	The Treasure of the Sierra Madre	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Greedy unfriendly bums take a Mexican Holiday	After reading this book, I was amazed at the drift and contrasting focus of this book. At first, I could not figure out whether the first passages are meant to introduce us to our heroic protagonist so as to have him remain a hero. Did he mean for the main character, Dobbs, to be a hero? While in South America, a victim of oil company greed, Dobbs is somewhat likeable and is an everyman as a bum. Then Traven carries the story into the gold mines of Mexico and gradually allows him to deteriorate into a greed driven paranoid maniac.  Was this a drift in the writer's original intention? We are left wondering whether he meant to take the character of Dobb, a vagabond American, and transform him from a relatively hopeful bum struggling to survive in Latin American into a greed possessed and self destructive monstrosity. The ugly male dialogue is full of nasty testosterone and competition. Males on the margin communicate very directly with each other, as evidenced by Traven's colorful insults. Whereas some critiques point out that his male to male stuggles are similar to Earnest Hemingway; others indicate he has developed the social consciousness and economic context surrounding his characters like Upton Sinclair. I would like to point out that his talent for embedding stories within stories is similar to the English writer, A.S. Byatt. His embedded stories are swift tangents, totally relevant to the movement of the main theme, and yet a distanced commentary. For example, one story is about a hard scrappy widow women gold miner who brings her gold to the capital fighting every kind of low class riff raft and thieves as she makes her way out of the jungle and into civilization. Yet, the upper class steal her fortune and cause her to disappear. A cautionary tale that greed is far beyond class lines and in fact may even be less openly evident in the wealthy, but surely just as deadly. The character of Howard, the man who has learned through trail and error to control his greed so as to keep his life was developed beautifully by Traven. He seems too mature and wise to be true and yet he remains true. The novel can be taken at various levels. A structural approach would see all the characters as victims of economic oppression, fighting each other like rats in a jar. Yet the individual character development would argue against this interpretation. Dobbs became evil, Howard remained sane. I found the book to be excellent. Tension filled, strong dialogue, unexpected character development, socially conscious, culturally reflective, rough, and elegant in its time honored message.	2004-05-26

Through her he meets her totally diabolical ganster partner, also an American expatriot. He also meets her 17 year old son, the entire meaning of her life, a secret which she keeps hidden from her evil partner. Our hero, God bless him, manipulates the situation so that her partner thinks she has betrayed him and he also learns about the existence of the son. Soon her son disappears into the white slavery void, which the reader is lead to believe is a living death. Our hero has now deprived this woman of the meaning in her life, she is now ready to be his partner in suicide.  Beautifully written, this nightmare novel, hints at a spiritual vacuum within the young American. Somewhere deep inside he thinks that God ignores petty sins, and that only a vast and terrible betrayal will get God's attention. Like the hero in Paul Bowles' Let It Come Down, those without meaning in life are revealed to be the most dangerous type of humans. Greed or revene or lust pales in comparison to those who are filled with nothingness. Plante's hero seems to be escaping from a Christian nation, doubting all the lessons of his culture and childhood faith. Bowles's hero in comparison carrys a mask of normalcy even though he has broken ties with any social contract.	2004-05-22

Ulysses draws Achilles up from Hades with a ditch of blood, from which he lures the dead like thirsty vampires. Thetis the ocean goddess makes love to the human (...) in a vast range of substance and form, from fire to lioness. Helen contemplates as the Greeks kill all Priam's family around her. Chiron the Centaur raises the mischievious boy Achilles, who trys to find his sheathed penis. Achilles bears down on Hector and then drags the body for 12 days, yet the body never deteriorates since it is favored by the gods. Priam begs for his son's body and Achilles emotionally moves to the point or stage where he can release the body of the man who killed his lover Patroclus. Elizabeth Cook washes the reader in dream image after image, making Achilles less real with each passage and more archtypal, residing in the unconscious.	2004-05-15

He tells the story of the sacrifice of Iphigeneia but his commentary is relevant to all times, especially our own. His insertion of contemporary expressions added wry humor. Agamemnon, however, remained a puzzle, motivated by greed and power, determined to unite the Greeks and destroy the Trojans, he is manipulated into a cul de sac by his chief scribe, Odysseus, and the priests of Zeus. He must sacrifice his beloved daughter to appease Zeus and thus change the winds in favor of the Greek fleet. Odysseus, the scribe, and the priests continue to support this course of action openly to build consensus among hte Greeks and maintain the unity of the Greek troops. The one false note here is that when a powerful leader is forced into making such a sacrifice by his counselors, his resentment later erupts to destroy those who manipulated him into a corner. Odysseus was too clever not to recognize that Agamemnon's resentment would eventually erupt and be aimed at those who restricted his previous course of action.<br /> Homosexuality was dealt with in the novel as an ordinary daily occurance, both in the relationship between the priest of Apollo, Calchas and his beautiful acolyte and then in the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus, his cousin and lover. Achilles had the cruelty and arrogance of the beautiful and athletic demi-god, cutting of the head of a thief for a petty crime.<br /> Unsworth reveals the desires for power and wealth that motivated the Greeks, using the seduction/kidnapping of Helen by Paris as a pretext. The wronged husband Menelaus is a fool, rapist, bore that surely was disgusting to Helen. In the same way that Agamemnon's revenge was never fully developed, Iphigenia's agreement to her own sacrificial death was not fully developed either. Unsworth states that the father did not have enough sense of duty and the daughter had too much of a sense of duty. Thus he is pressured by Odyssus to assume leadership including makingany sacrifice to unite his troops. Iphigenia is also pressured by Odyssus to make her ultimate sacrifice to her father and the nations of Greece as they move toward triumph. I have to give Unsworth credit for writing a page turner, even knowing the end, I was compelled to read faster and faster as the Princess moved toward her doom. In her arrogance, Iphigenia was not a sympathetic victim. But the stupidity and manipulative world of men made her a victim and worthy of some sympathy.	2004-05-15

It is about the destructive power of obsession for perfection. The artist Frenhofer over-paints and touches-up his masterpiece until it is not recognizable as anything but a mess. Balzac's Gambarra was too wordy but it does have the interesting theme of an artist, totally consumed by his personal vision, and thus not able to recognize the sacrifices and motivations of those around him. He writes an opera about the beginnings of Islam and the sacrifice of a woman for the man she loves. Yet Gambarra can not see this same pattern being played out with his wife and thus his single minded vision destroys his marriage. He is both a genius and a fool. His atonal compositions were 100 years before their time.  His inability to empathize and get out of his own visions results in his wife's running off with an Italian count who plots to steal Gambarra's wife after he sees the composer's Achille's heel.  I don't think I would recommend these books to anyone but artists.  They reveal the artistic feet of clay which we so often overlook.	2004-05-03

The essays about French cooking were certainly confirming in that the history of cooking is grounded in peasant fare and a return to those roots is a central theme in understanding good cooking foundations. I was most impressed however not by the essays on French government and culture but by the soft personal loving sections of the book on Gopnik's young son. Gopkik and his son swim at the Ritz pool in Paris where they meet two young girls. Gopnik's son's playful love for one of the female children was written so well and so transparently that I was amazed. The boy responds like a puppy, abaze with attraction and energy, swimming fearlessly in the deep end of the pool, like a magnet, a duckling, a male. Gopnik, the wise father, perfectly reads the situation, seeing eros engulf his little child, and supports the situation so that his son fully experiences this first taste of the honey and sting of the beautiful other.The children order expensive hot chocolate every day after swimming, which Gopnik endulges. It is Gopnik's wife upon discovering the VISA card balance that brings reality back into the picture. I would say to Gopnik &quot;Your choices were correct, as you yourself know. The good father allows a child to experience the pull of beauty in the world, aware of the risks, aware of the rewards.&quot; I expected thoughtful essays because I have been a New Yorker/Gopnik fan. However, the passages on his relationship with his young son were sublime.	2004-05-02

Each time I take away new insights for my own journey. There are some very appealing concepts and I will mention a few. Dunne's descrption of the spiritual journey's of Jesus Christ, Gotoma, and Mohammed as both a personal journey with personal truth, a spiritual journey with truth across cultures, and a historic truth across time was excellent. The passages on the &quot;passing over&quot; of Gandhi between religions, carrying insights from one truth to another truth was so relevant to our current Western experiences. The fable of the knight who seeks God on the mountain top and then finds the mountain barren so he must go down into the valley of human enterprise to seek God was beautifully told. I remain fascinated by this statement &quot;Man wishes to become God and God wishes to become Man.&quot; I would recommend for those interested in comparative religion, to those who read Carl Jung or Joseph Campbell's comparative mythology, to those who would apply Hegel's thesis, antithesis, and synthesis to world religions, to those who wish to gain benchmarks for their own spiritual quest from an analysis of these benchmarkes for the great spiritual leaders of the world, and to those who love God and enjoy his company in their quest.	2004-04-19

The strengths also include the story of the Irish potato famine and the perils of monoculture.

This short tale is of a family totally controlled and dominated by a father's greed. The father actually weighs out eggs, butter, flour, and sugar for the family servant to use every day. His wife, daughter, and family servant all have adjusted their views of reality to accomodate his greed. The equilibrium is upset when Cousin Charles Grandet comes to visit. The women in the household cater to the needs of this handsome young man but the father is unsympathetic upon hearing that his brother has become bankrupt and a suicide and the young man is penniless. By the time the young man leaves, the daughter of the house is totally in love with him. She writes to Charles but after a few letters he fails to respond further to her letters. As the miserly father withers and dies, so too does the expectations and soul of his daughter, Eugenie. Balzac did a really fine job of showing how self defeating the miser's greed was to his family and his relationship with his wife and child. After the death of the father, Eugenie inherits a fortune. Cousin Charles meanwhile has become rich through the slave trade between African and the Caribbean. His soul has shrunk and he is about to marry a 19 year old socialite for her family connections. He writes a letter telling Eugenie that he has never stopped loving her but that he must look out for his interests with this advantageous marriage. He receives a letter back that is polite yet biting, gracious yet revengeful, compassionate and understanding yet reminding of the lost opportunity. Charles then finds out that his cousin, whom he loves, is extremely wealthy and he has made a decision that he thought was advantageous which turned out to be less than optimal. Balzac has the faithful maid as the only winner in the story.  Eugenie rewards her for her years of hard work and service. The story resonates with Henry James' Washington Square. They both involve a triangle between a rich father, an innocent daughter, and a suitor. The difference is that James' father is cruel to his daughter thinking that since she is plain and shy that men will court her only for money. Eugenie's father's obsession was wealth, the effects on his family were a consequence of his greed, not due to his conscious demeaning sarcasm. Both heroines seek revenge on the suitor, James' with a trick and Balzac's with a superbly written letter that left the revenge to his own immagination and judgement. James' suitor was indeed a crook, whereas Charles Grandet was lead into opportunism and missed chances. Finally, the Aunt in Washington Square was a silly gossip who was not supportive of the daughter/niece whereas the mother and servant in Eugenie Grandet were supportive of Eugenie. I would strongly recommend reading Eugenie Grandet, a concise,short, book. Balzac was just to his characters and this realistic justice made for a fine short novel.	2003-08-29
US	35501691	RC4TOAL1794TT	0679752706	840321367	The Temple of the Golden Pavilion	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Alienation	Mishima's beautiful introspective language and unique imagery kept me engaged in an unfolding tragedy. I find I disagree with almost all the other reviewers as to the meaning of this work. The young Mizoguchi finds he can not have sexual intercourse without the image of the Golden Pavilion dominating his consciousness. Mishima repeats the Zen koan \\"If you meet the Buddha in the road, kill him.\\" three times. He also provides long dreamy discourse on the beauty of the temple. Surely there is a connection between attachment to beauty and diversion from enlightenment. To some extent the acolyte mets the Buddha in the road and kills him when Mizoguchi burns the national treasure, the temple of the Golden Pavilion. My edition has an introduction by Nancy Wilson Ross where she interprets MIzoguchi's alienation as the result of nationlessness, an experience for post-war Japanese. Whereas extreme nationalism may have been a concern for Mishima, I did not detect this influence as a major contirbutor to Mizoguchi's alienation. In fact, his bare reality confrontive dismissive mother would be enough to shake any psyche. Other critics have pointed out that the theme is resentment of the object of desire. This rings more true but doesn't provide a strong enough theory to pull the entire narrative together. There are several amazing images in the book. The Japanese naval officer who formally meets with his mistress in a tea ceremony prior to his leaving for war is haunting and beautiful. The mistress pulls her breasts from her kimona and squeezes her milk into the tea, which is drunk by her lover as his farewell. What an amazing image of love's nourishment and the observation that intimacy between human beings is mediated by our body fluids. I also found the relationship between the Superior of the Temple and Mizoguchi to be interesting. The Superior's aloof attitude could also be interpreted as a mature recognition that we can not really mentor anyone without making our mark uponthem. The Superior takes a hands off attitude toward Mizoguchi, allowing him to struggle toward some self realization. Yet, when the Superior realizes that a deep wound exists in Mizoguchi's soul, he responds by assuming a prostrate submissive humble posture during his garden meditations where he is sure Mizoguchi will see him. It is as if to say, \\"I bring no weapons against your evil, pass away from us.\\"  Mizoguchi does pass, but not until he burns the temple.	2003-07-17

I was not impressed with the flimsy essense that de Botton derives from Proust's work. The concept that original observation requires self editing and avoiding stereotypical labeling and categorization is not new news. The concept that reading allows us to reflect on our own circumstances and experiences is also not new news. The third theme that the best artists observe the world in a unique way, allowing others to appreciate their vision and possibly develop a vision of their own was the last straw for me. There are some adolescents with limited life experiences that may find this book of interest. For a more experienced reader, go to the source itself, not this weak distillation.	2003-05-24

Yet it is Herod's bargaining with Salome to release him from the promise of beheading the Baptist that transforms the story beyond cautionary folk tale.  Herod has a strong inclination that the death of the Baptist will bring about his own death. Thus he bargains with Salome to release him from his oath to give her anything she wishes if she will dance for him. As he describes endless beautiful cascades of riches, he becomes more and more lost and resigned to his fate. The riches of the world become flimsy and fragile through the hypnotic repetition and description and Herod becomes more convinced of their temporal value as he sees his fate laid out before him.  The tale of the spoiled fairy tale princess and the everyman declining king are tied together by Wilde in the final sentence of the play where Salome pays for her destructive passions while Herod makes one last power stoke before he falls.	2003-05-09

The connections between the works of Hobbes and Descartes and Spinoza show intellectual reaction and continuity. The connections and associations between Spinoza's work and the Dutch Reform Church and the Jewish community in Amsterdamn seem logically constructed and documented. The potential influence of the rise of the de Witt brothers and their assassination also was also thoughtfully developed. I needed this background of Dutch protestantism, the rise of the Dutch republic, and the philosophical forefathers to better place Spinoza's thought. It is interesting that he and Rembrandt were contemporaries and yet there is no evidence that either knew of the works of the other. The final chapters where Gullan-Whur records the commentaries of Goethe, George Elliott, George Santayana, Bertrand Russell, and David Hume to the work of <BR>Spinoza further places his work in context from the perspective of later centuries. <br />Bertrand Russell's quotation: \\"The noblest and most lovable of the great philosophers.  Intellectually some others have surpassed him, but ethically he is supreme.  As a natural <BR>consequence he was considered, during his lifetme and for a century after his death, a man of appalling wickedness.\\"<br />This observation by Russell is fully illustrated throughout the book as Spinoza struggles to express his philosophy while staying under the 'radar\\" of the repressive cultural and religious forces of his day.<br />A quotation by Hegel: \\"The allegations of those who accuse Spinoza of atheism are the direct opposite of the truth; with him there is too much God.\\" is also fully illustrated by the exploration of Spinoza's philosophy that is integrated into the biography.	2003-05-03

I would have identified with the adolescent pressures and the adolescent attachments. However I was less impressed by the adolescent angst of the first 80% of the book as I was by the reflection in the final 20% of the book. In this section Watkins identifies 3 themes. First, Watkins describes his growth and  movement from the body of a boy to the body of a man through the story of learning to throw the javelin. He describes beautifully and simply the first time he became aware that he had control of his muscles and strength and was leaving the awkwardness of childhood behind. Second, Watkins simply and clearly describes the discovery of his inner reservoir of strength that he develops first as a survivor and observer and finally as a writer. Third, through non-accusational reflection he realizes he was sent to the Dragon School and Eton to fulfill a perceived weakness and vulnerability that Paul's father felt toward the elite uppper class. Thus he sends his child to the best schools to protect him from the barbs of aristocracy. Why do father's do this to their sons? Each man must wrestle with his own vulnerabilities and make peace with his inadequacies. I was also left wondering whether he forgave his mother in the same way he seemed to forgive his father for sending him into this elite and cold experience while still a small child?	2003-02-02
