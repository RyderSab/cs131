I recently picked up this book because I recognized the name of famed nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal. The Jews suffered terribly under Pharaoh during the days of Moses and under Hitler during World War II. The tale of a nazi soldier asking a Jew - enslaved in a concentration camp - to forgive him for his sins is incredible. To ask forgiveness of one person as a representative of his people is quite a believable notion. Haven't US Presidents apologized for slavery, internment camps, etc in the name of the citizens of the United States??<BR>I liked the fact that Simon's conscience bothered him after he left the soldier's bedside once he heard his terrible tale. I enjoyed his philosophical talks with his fellow prisoners as well as the trip he took to the soldier's mothers house after the war. This was a well-written book and it should be required reading in all high schools.	2003-07-30

JOSHUA is a &quot;what if&quot; type story: What if Jesus came back today? Would he be disappointed in this fast paced world that we have become? Would He still love us unconditionally? Nay to the first question and aye to the second. Father Girzone writes a nice little parable with plenty of thought-provoking speeches from Joshua. The movie version was good too but it left out alot of events from the book and made up others. Still the book and DVD are inspiring.	2003-02-27

I mainly picked up this book because it was written by the talented Maya Angelou's son. As the saying goes, the apple did not fall far from the tree. Guy Johnson definitely has his mothers gift of prose. <BR>LeRoi 'King' Tremain was one of the most realistic characters created in a novel. He had anger, strength of will, love of family, his own set of morals/rules and a strong sense of justice. From the time he was growing up to his days as a grandfather, there is always a sense of honor involved in his life. He will not stand for disrespect nor to be called the n-word. He battles enemy soldiers, the Klan, hoodlums, etc and always comes out on top. There is a sense of pathos in his life as well because of the search for his older son who was left at an orphanage by an enemy. And the wife who betrays his trust even after risking all to save his life. I sure hope Guy writes another novel with his larger than life creation.	2002-05-29

This graphic novel reprints the first 4 issues of the SPECTRE series by John Ostrander and Tom Mandrake. They redefined the character for a new generation and did not throw out any of his previous history (he dates back to the 1940s). Ostrander is one of the best writers in comics and is not afraid to tackle controversial topics. The artwork of Mandrake is both moody and exquisite at the same time. They made an awesome team and this comic was the best one published by DC in quite awhile. The comic was voluntarily ended by Ostrander but what great stories he gave us (well over 60 issues of classic storytelling).	2002-02-26

Kurt Busiek and Mark Bagley surprised the fans with one of the greatest and most unexpected endings in the history in comics. I am not revealing any surprises since the cover clearly shows that the super heroic team of Thunderbolts are actually the villianous Masters of Evil. The twists and turns that the team of Busiek/Bagley include in the series keep the fans coming back. The villians enjoy playing the role of hero so much that some of them even begin to think about abandoning their lives of crime. The characterization is top notch and the artwork is outstanding.<BR>This is an excellent graphic novel that includes all the first appearances of the T-bolts as well as the first few issues of their own comic.	2002-02-13

JLA Earth 2 is a graphic novel depicting an evil version of earth and its heroes. There are negative duplicates of the JLA that call themselves the Crime Syndicate of America (hey at least they're patriotic crooks!)<BR>This novel is an adaption/reworking of a Gardner Fox JLA story from the 60s with a few twists and turns not encountered in the original comic books (courtesy of Grant Morrison).<BR>Frank Quitely's artwork is exquisite in that he captures facial expressions and angles normally not seen in American comic books.<BR>A good read but I wish it had a little more action and battles between the CSA and JLA.	2002-01-03

Alex Haley &amp; Dave Stevens' QUEEN is a rare gem---the story of an american family that touches many lives. Queen is the main focus of the book but her story spans past &amp; future generations from Ireland to America. Some of the characters are tragic but all have hope for a better tomorrow. The heartbreak of Easter's love for her &quot;master&quot;, Queen being taught to read by her grandpa and the Haley family's quest to get a better education for their youngest son are just some of the heartbreaking stories in this novel.

An excellent book and just the right one to read after all the tragedies with the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The characters Ruben St.Clair and Trevor were so wonderfully written that it seemed like they were real people.<BR>The humor is well done and the way people help others in this novel are touching.

I read David's first book &quot;A Child called IT&quot; and found this installment of his saga to be much more inspiring. All david wanted was to be loved and he could not find that with his mother. He did find it in the homes of a couple of people who took him in. Even tho he still got into trouble, you could see that all he needed was true love to turn him around. He became a foster child but it did not dim his soul. Now I have to read the next book in the series.	2001-10-02

I love Peter David's writing style and always enjoy his TREK novels. His use of back history, humor and characterization make for a truly pleasing read. I always found the Deanna Troi/Worf relationship on the TV series to be not being very convincing so I was glad to see it resolved. I was surprised to see the return of Tom Riker and Sela because I found them to be useless characters but not the way they are written up in this story. David uses them extensively with much more personality than they have ever been portrayed with before.<BR>Other bits I enjoyed were the inclusion of Dickens' A Christmas Carol with Capt Picard (since Patrick Stewart played Scrooge on stage), the surprise appearance of another Deep Space 9 character (read the book if you want to know who it is!!) and Worf mourning his lost loves K'helyr and Jadzia.<BR>A good novel but not as great as the first IMZADI but then again a Peter David Trek adventure is always an excellent read.	2001-09-25

It was very depressing and I just couldnt imagine that a parent could do so many horrifying things to their own child. I have to read the next book in the series to see how David survives in the world after he is taken out of his abusive home. I could not put the book down but it was a depressing read. With the help of God and the substitute teacher, he was able to escape this nightmare of a life. I am sure the next book will be more uplifting than this one was.	2001-08-13

My friend Dan the man has been pestering me for awhile now to read this title. I always hesitated until he gave me an issue. Of course I was hooked immediately. Solid story-telling and excellent artwork plus intriguing characters. This trade paperback collects the first six issues of the original series with some extras like Alex Ross pencil sketches. I enjoyed every story especially the &quot;everyman&quot; aspect. Normal humans interacting with superheroic individuals. My favorite characters were Jack-in the-box and SilverAgent. There is so much negativity in comics these days so it is a pleasure to read the adventures of Astro City. Kurt Busiek continues to amaze with his storylines and I will continue to read them.	2001-07-30

The reason I picked up this book was because it was an OPRAH pick. I held off reading it until I saw the movie version on HBO. The characters of Jefferson and Grant were almost mirror images of each other. Where one was ignorant, the other was smart. Where one was brave, the one was weak. They needed each other. The Lesson Before Dying could apply to the 2 of them. Each had a lesson to learn and it had to happen before the execution. Mr.Gaines' use of dialect and characterization added alot to the overall novel. The ladies in the novel were strong and helped their men grow as well. An excellent novel with powerful themes of hope and redemption.	2001-07-24

I read it on a plane ride to Texas and loved a lot of the insights that Mr.McDowell included. I also liked the way he presented various scenarios about many key moments in the Gospels. It was a pleasant read and I passed the book on to a female friend while in Texas. Once read, it should be passed on so others can enjoy it as well.	2001-04-13

In the beginning it almost felt like an episode of the Disney Guy Williams TV show but then it got better with the introduction of the Japanese samurai. I liked the themes of honor and commitment throughout the book. Zorro has his code of honor where he does not kill and wants to save the people from harm while the Dragon Riders have their own code that is tarnished under the service of the Aztec villian. I don't know if this book was a continuation of another novel but it felt that way because Zorro was out of action in a small section of the story. It was a good story with elements of action and humor.	2001-04-13

I enjoyed his history of globalization because it was more far reaching than any other book I have read. Friedman goes all the way back to Eden and the story of Cain &amp; Abel when he talks about globalization. My favorite chapter was #2 because of the photo of the Jewish man holding his cellular phone at the Western Wall so his relative in France can pray. Friedman's background as a NY Times journalist also gives the book a more newsworthy feel. I also like the dichotomy of the title (Lexus sedans and Olive trees indeed).	2001-01-25

Reverend Alson Pierce loses his wife and child to a sadistic racist madman. He slowly plots his revenge in the form of forgiving the man who destroyed his life and then entering the prison to end his existence. The novel is full of interesting (and tragic) characters but the saddest is the Reverend. He starts to almost lose his sanity and way of life by following the path of revenge. It ruins his relationships with family, church and friends. He breaks many of God's commandments on his mission of redemption for his wife and child. The plot also involves a camera crew filming a documentary about the reverend &amp; the killer, a prison riot and a sad friendship with a lonely woman from the church. The story held my interest and the end surprised me. I will not reveal anymore but the book was quite fascinating.	2001-01-11

He also talks about the neglected shoppers: children and senior citizens. Many retailers should take note of this book and offer it to all their managers.

Cassie was a typical teenager who had fallen in with the wrong crowd. But through her parents' tough love and friends at a christian school, she was able to turn around her life. Unfortuntately, she lost her life during the senseless violence at Columbine. Misty Bernall has written a powerful book about her daughter's life and how GOD works miracles in our lives. This book shows us that life cannot be take for granted but at least Cassie lived a good christian life near the end of her existence on earth. I commend her mom for sharing their story even tho it must have been extremely heartbreaking for her to have written this book. SHE SAID YES is a good spiritually enlightened read and should be mandatory reading for all teenagers (we all go through those tough times so its nice to see how someone struggled to overcome them).	2000-11-13

To show the horror of nuclear holocaust through the eyes of the survivors is the best way to convey it. The 6 survivors documented in this  book where extraordinary people who went on to do something with their  lives instead of being bitter. The story that was the most inspiring was  Dr.Fujii and how he helped others. Then after the war, he enjoyed life to  the fullest and helped many foreigners as well. The sad thing was that even  though they had nothing to do with what happened to them , the survivors  were shunned even by their own people for being &quot;hibakusha&quot;. To  know what that is, you have to read the book. So I encourage whoever sees  this review to read the book.	2000-07-28

CAIN is a long read but a good read as well. I  would recommend this to horror as well as sci-fi fans. The underlying theme  was the power of faith and how it will overcome all. Of course there is  great sacrifice involved but what a great story.	2000-07-05

Each story made you think about  ethics and how/when to apply them. I do not know about Mr.Blanchard's  writings but I think he focused on the business aspects of ethical  dilemmas.

He has a great mixture of action, horror and humor which makes reading his books so enjoyable. My favorite characters were Joshua Wolf &amp; Duncan the vampire. Darlene was  great too but Mr.David always writes a great female character--strong and  tender. I hope to read more of the misadventures of Josh and Darlene  (sequel maybe? )	2000-01-20

I dont want to sound like a grinch but I found When Angels Sing to be a ho-hum book. Oh it had its moments but overall it was an average story that probably has been done a million times in movies and series like Little House on the Prairie. I did like its theme of families together through  thick and thin. I do recommend the book but I dont want other readers going  into it like I did expecting a great little story but getting an average  tale. It is still a good book but I just dont see it as a classic. Sorry........	1999-12-29

I picked this book up for 2 reasons: Peter David and RO Laren. I'm a fan of both. I read anything written by Peter David because he mixes adventure and humor very well. RO was one of my favorite ST characters and Kira is  just a pale imitation. I did enjoy the interplay between the 2 Bajorans and  the fact that if it wasnt for RO joining the Marquis, she would have been  the one assigned to Deep Space 9. The story was so-so but the characters  are fun to read especially Quark and Rom. Needed a little more adventure  but overall it was a pleasant read.	1999-12-29

Very cute story about a little boy whose Christmas Tree angel comes to life to sing sweet songs to him. Gorgeous artwork brings the story to life with brilliance. I loved that the story repeated itself once the little boy  grew up and had a son of his own who hears the angels music.	1999-12-23

Charles Dickens' Christmas Carol is read annually along with any and all movie versions. The tale is so simple yet so full of detail. Scrooge is every man who lets life get him down until something changes the status  quo. The use of spirits to guide a person to a better path in life is so in  tune with the 1990s where everyone is searching for miracles whether they  involve spirits or angels or whatever. A true classic that has withstood  the test of time and will continue to delight for generations to come.	1999-12-17

He is a worthy successor to Norman Rockwell (what would a Batman by Rockwell be like?) The story is good but its the artwork that tells the tale of the caped crusader  in his daily efforts to rid Gotham City of crime. Bruce Wayne also plays a  large role in this story. Very fine addition to the DC mythos.	1999-12-17

I enjoyed this book with its twists on the Charles Dickens novel A Christmas Carol. I liked the fact that Scrooge came to the 20th century to rescue a person very much like himself before the ghosts' visits. Ms.monica  banks was a great character and fun to listen to. A very worthy christmas  novel.	1999-12-13

Jack Cole's Plastic Man was one of the most original heroes ever created. A former criminal who fights crime with a body that can stretch into any form. More comics today should be like this simple character from the 40s.  The stories in this Archive stand up remarkably well and are still fun.	1999-11-02

Like Jaws, only bigger,whiter and more dangerous. My favorite chapter was the one with the surfers--well-written  with humor and adventure. I wish more of the chapters had been like this  and that the character of Jonas was a little more developed. But I did like  the play on his name (like Jonah swallowed by the whale in the Bible).	1999-10-27

With a time travelling watch, he goes back to the days of slavery and lives a rough life. This  &quot;slave life&quot; teaches him that being with family and learning are  the 2 most positive experiences in life. The characters of Jordan and Uriah  are well written. Many teens should read this book.	1999-09-07

Excellent story involving time travel and a love story so strong that  nothing can stand in its way. The characters of Stefan and Laura are  written so well that I hated to see their story end. The novel is full of  twists especially about the time travel angle. I was pleased to see that no  one in the Amazon reviews revealed the secret about the time travel. This  would make an excellent movie in the tradition of TERMINATOR and LOVE  STORY	1999-08-18

I love the title of this book. Tuesday is such a &quot;blah&quot; day of the week but Mr.Albom makes it very special with his insightful talks with Morrie Schwartz. This professor/student relationship is so touching that it  makes one wish everyone had such a teacher in life. I had heard many good  things about this book but had to read it for myself. I wasn't even aware  that Ted Koppel had interviewed Morrie three times! Morrie's points about  life were poignant and all too true. I wish more people had this insight  and not just near the end of one's life.	1999-07-16

I have had this book for years and never thought I would like it because of the Tarzan portrayals in the movies. But I was pleasantly surprised by the well written adventures of the jungle lord. Rice Burroughs has fully  captured the essence of a man who comes to see civilization with the eyes  of a child but the heart of a warrior. His great love for Kala the  apemother and Jane his future mate were written beautifully. I recently saw  Disneys Tarzan and the Chris Lambert film Greystoke the Legend of Tarzan  and they both capture the story of Tarzan as Burroughs envisioned it. I  truly enjoyed the book and recommend it highly. I cant wait to read more of  the books in the series.	1999-07-13

But it looks like the book was written individually by the 3 authors and then put together but not  very cohesively. Maybe more will be explained in the next novel but the  reader should not be as confused as the main character of the novel. I also  think the 2 other authors should have had their names on the cover as well  as Dorn.	1999-05-27

It was a different type of read is about all I can say about it.	1999-04-28

The Angel Doll is a nice story of 2 little boys who deliver newspapers. One of the boys (Whitey) is saving money to buy an angel doll for his sick sister. My favorite aspect of the book is the theme of love shown by the  characters like Whitey,  Mrs.Barnes, and others. It is a nice little story  that can be read year round with a heartwarming end involving angel dolls.	1999-04-13

It makes me proud to be of puerto rican descent. It is funny, serious, heart warming and any other adjective that I can't think of at this moment. I enjoyed this novel so much that I have passed it on to  numerous friends at my job and relatives. It is getting worn out but its  worth it just to hear peoples reactions to it. A truly well written account  of one womans struggle to make it. I cant wait to read it again. This novel  truly deserves to be made into a motion picture.

He led a tough life inside and outside the ring. He bares his soul in this book unlike other athletes who have no accepted responsibility for their actions.

I never knew much about Harry Turtledove until my cousin passed this book on to me. I was immediately hooked by the cover image of General Lee holding an uzi. I must say that I very much enjoyed this 'what if' type of  history. All the characters were well written and the events were obviously  well studied before being included in the novel. I highly recommend this  book to civil war buffs as well as sci-fi fans. This would make an  excellent movie. I hope someone in Hollywood has read Turtledove and is  considering a movie.	1999-01-27

Alex Ross has outdone himself (once again) with his great paintings. He brings a norman rockwell touch to the world of comics. The story by Paul Dini is great and very touching.

It was a great idea to put a fictional character like the Batman in a real life situation. It was ironic because the Batman was born due to a type of child abuse (his parents were murdered  right in front of him). I like Mr.vachss writing style with his emphasis on  characterization and mickey spillane-like fighting scenes. I hope he can  one day write a sequel. It would be a great thing if one day all types of  child abuse could be eradicated but at least Mr.Vachss' roles as  writer/lawyer can help people one at a time.	1998-10-28

Excellent representation of the entire Silver Surfer series from the late  60s/early 70s. The stories by StanLee bring out a shakespearan quality in  the Surfer. And the art by the 2 kings of comics (Kirby &amp;  Buscema)--wow!! I didnt think black &amp; white reprints would work but it  does in this case. A true Marvel masterwork with StanLee at his creative  story writing best.	1998-09-30
