If you liked Bonfire of the Vanities by Tom Wolfe, then you should read Gotham Tragic.  The author uses a glamorous New York City restaurant as a backdrop for the antics that follow.  The characters are all excellent--some are sympathetic, some are hilarious, some are despicable.  The story is a page-turner that doesn't disappoint.  I highly recommend this book!	2004-02-19

There are many better books to spend your money on in hardcover that aren't as pulpy as this one.  I recommend instead buying The Dogs of Babel, The Pursuit of Alice Thrift or The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime, all three far superior to this one and worth the money.  You should wait for the paperback for this one.  I wouldn't have felt so angry at the low quality if I'd spent less of my hard-earned cash on it, you know?	2003-09-12

It won't stay with you, however, nor will you find it particularly moving while you're reading it.  I mean--well, it's fine.  And that's not exactly what I look for in a book, and I doubt you do either.  If you're interested, my advice is wait for the paperback.	2003-09-10

I'm not a teacher myself, but I have many friends who teach in the public schools here and they have had similar experiences.  Very revealing, very human, very funny.  Highly recommended.	2003-09-10

Frankly, it's not really a book for adults--it's a kids book, and the author is a children's book author.  It's being marketed as an adult book, and I'm not quite sure why.  Like most literature for children, it's fun to read, but it's only skin deep.  You will forget this story as soon as you close the covers.  So if you want to spend your money on a book that you will enjoy for about two hours and then forget about, then go for it.  For me, however, I wish I would have waited for the paperback.	2003-07-15

The Dogs of Babel is one of those rare books that has everything to offer:  a suspenseful story that makes it a pageturner, beautiful writing that engages the mind, wonderful characters...

I devour new collections like candy.  This one is certainly several cuts above what I usually come across. Mr. Stolar's short stories sneak up on you, engage you in places and characters lives so deeply, and slowly lead up to a climax like a punch in the gut.  Nothing surprising or thriller-like, but simply emotional and real. I really loved this book and I would recommend it to anyone.  A truly great read from a truly talented author.	2003-06-03

In that book, I fell in love with Clara winter, and now I've fallen in love with William T. Jones.  McGhee creates a world that my mind never leaves upon finishing her books.  It stays with me--a feeling, an image, sometimes a sadness.  This is a worth follow-up to Shadow Baby, and I will eagerly await another book from this very talented writer.	2003-02-17

What more could a girl ask for?  The setting is Sofia, Bulgaria, a place that I knew little about before picking of Ward's novel.  I like to read books that have a definite sense of place, that can teach me something new while entertaining me at the same time, and Ward's book is just that kind of book.  You'll be swept up into the rocky marriage of Ethan and June, while also learning about Eastern European politics despite yourself.  Ward's prose is savvy and fast-paced.  I highly recommend!	2002-05-20

I picked it up and I couldn't stop reading after the first two pages.  The author's honesty is astounding; his voice is compelling; his capacity for humor in a distinctly unfunny situation is incredible.  This book is a testament to how strong we all are in the face of adversity.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading, and I would make it a must-read book for anyone who needs to find strength during a tough time.  I would give this book more stars if I could!	2002-03-05

In light of all the recent tragedy around the world, it seems like maybe a book about etiquette wouldn't be on my reading list.  However, while having a hard time focusing on things in general, I'm finding this book to be a delight.  This book is not only informative (who couldn't use a lesson in writing thank-you notes, when email notes are appropriate, cell phone etiquette, etc.?), but also hilarious.  These two Grrls are wits, for sure.  So if you're looking for something to take your mind off things, give this a shot.  I think you'll be amused, and you'll learn something along the way.	2001-10-09

After reading the glowing New York Times review of this book, I went to the local bookstore and picked this one up--and loved it!  It's the perfect summer read for smart people in that it's literary but also a tad on the trashy side at times.  This is a page turner that reads like the best kind of movie, one that you take seriously but you also gasp and laugh as the plot progresses.  One scene between the older writer, Richard Whitehurst, and his daughter, Kerry, will have you gasping!	2001-07-24

Julie Schumacher tells the story here of a family that is doing it's best to love one another, but sometimes our best is simply not good enough.  Schumacher is adept at  naming these often unnameable problems of life in stunning prose that at  times just tore me apart--and this is the highest praise.

Clara winter (you'll see why she spells her last name without a capital when you read the book) is an 11-year-old girl you'll never forget.  She is precocious in her wordminded-ness, yet  naive and childlike in her propensity for fantasy.  In Shadow Baby, Clara  goes on a search for her own history--her dead twin sister, her MIA  grandfather, her phantom father.  This book is stunningly written, both  hilariously funny and achingly sad.  Truly a literary feat.  Love it love  it love it.	2000-04-14

She is kind of like Mulder &amp; Scully wrapped into one.  In this book, Deming explores several natural habitats--a small coastal town in Oregon is my personal favorite, since I've actually been to that one--and her relationship to them.  How  can we involve ourselves in nature without corrupting it?  Is it possible?   If not, then how do we learn about it?  How can we enjoy it?  Don't get me  wrong though; this is not a prescriptive book on how to effectively enjoy  nature without leaving behind unsnipped six-pack holders, but more a  thoughtful, lyrical train of thought about our world and our place in it.   Wonderful reading.	2000-04-11

All you have to do to see how different this novel is from others you have read is open it up and look at the prose.  It's written in short poetic lines, separate little pieces.  As I began reading, I wondered if I was  missing out because I didn't understand everything...  Then I gave in and  just continued on--much to my delight.  The story of Ava unravels itself  subtly and carefully, like unrolling a newly discovered scroll written on  dangerously fragile parchment.  I can't recommend this book highly enough.   Do yourself a favor and buy it.  Sit somewhere peaceful and let yourself be  carried away.	1999-03-26

RAINLIGHT is an expertly woven tale of a town in the Adirondacks torn apart by the freak death of its beloved Starr Williams.  As vividly portrayed characters work to find ways to manage their grief, the magic is  in the details.  Although these characters are dealing with sadness, McGhee  manages to make them appealing.  I found myself wishing I could sit down in  Crystal's diner for hamburgers and milkshakes, spending some leisurely time  with Tim and Mallie--maybe even give the gift of something shiny to  Crystal's retarded son Johnny.  McGhee's world is one that is difficult to  leave behind.  A wonderful wonderful book!	1998-12-10

Sullivan portrays life in small town Minnesota with an eye for revealing detail, putting her characters in situations that bring forth their true colors, both good and bad.  The inhabitants of the town of Harvester are not as sugar-sweet as the residents of Jan Karon's Mitford.  There is some small-town goodness here, but Sally, whose story this is, and her neighbors have dark sides too.  A wonderful read, the kind where you are sad to turn the last page.	1998-06-03
