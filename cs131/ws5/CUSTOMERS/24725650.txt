I thought it was really unique, descriptive, exciting, and the ending although it was harsh, It was okay with me, because not everything has a happy ending. When I saw the sequel \\"City of the Dead\\" I assumed that it takes the ending of the rising and went even further, I was right. The same characters are ther (surprise they arent dead! yay!), Jim, Martin, Frankie,Ob, Danny and many many many (more than i can count) more. It takes place in a skyscraper in New York, built by a man who has delusions of grandeur, his name is Ramsey.The zombies, who we now know are demons reanimating the dead bodies to take over the earth to ultimatly destroy it. Ob is the leader, and no he cant fit into your pocket easily when you have your period. Anyway, grossness ensues, maggots, fluids, screaming, defleshing, rats, intestines, rot,sex with dead people...the old standbys, and our \\"survivors\\" manage to survive through another onslaught of zombie buffet, They find an underground tunnel, a promise of a bomb shelter, and in the end AGAIN, NO ONE SURVIVES, Keene makes us love these people, love this poor child danny and his father who dies saving him, love the prostitute, the cat God, the homeless pigpen but he KILLS them! and the world is destroyed! SO what was the point of this book? why keep us at the edge of our seat again,when we accepted the death of everyone at the last one, why give us hope that maybe the tiny few would prevail? I thought up untill the last paragraph that they would survive, and whammo, i was knocked off my feet..again! I put the book down and said \\"if Keene comes out with a book called \\"garden of the dead\\" because the plants are the next to be possessed by demons, i am turning the other way\\".	2005-09-27

Forget the heaving bosoms, forget the white ruffled shirt with the black cape, forget the oily hair and white skin, forget Lestat and Louie and claudia, there is a new vampire in town and she can spend some dough at the Mall! This book made me laugh so hard, because i could relate to alot of it, it made me break away from all the Anne Rice vampirisms that I am used to and see a new voice in that genre. Betsy is hilarious, she is sexy, and she is what buffy would have been if Spike had just taken a bite. It has some really hot sex scenes, great eroticism, wonderful character interactions and it will leave you wanting more...of everything. I so highly recommend this book, I cannot wait to read the second one.<br /><br />This a review on the audio book of \\"undead and unwed\\" Read by Nancy Wu. When i was reading this book I of course heard the \\"voices\\" of all the characters in my head. So when I got this audio book to listen to at work i was extremely dissapointed in the choice of person to read this. An Asian woman, reading for a red blooded american blonde female, male, black woman and otherwise? And you CAN tell the difference. It ruins it.Her voices for the males sound like grating glass on a chalkboard, she gives mark a 13 year old skater boy accent, Jessica is pure ghettofabulous, Sinclair sounds like he is part English, and part child molester. The eroticism and sexiness is out the door, she makes it sound cheesy and forced. Too bad she reads all the rest of the series, BAD BAD decison.	2005-09-20

I really think that in the third ring of hell is a folding table and an endless pile of sweaters with my name on it (just in case i do something wrong in this life).	2005-09-20

I had high hopes to say the least. It started out well, but it wasn't an intro that blew me away like I wanted it to, the characters of Amy, Cherry and Wren were really just repeats of every chick lit heroine out there, so they listen to sisters of mercy and the smiths, and smoke pot, and have awful alcoholic parents, and have sex, and have more sex, and hate themselves, and there is supposed to be this big secret maybe related to why Cherry is a nutcase (they all need to be institutionalized in my opinion), to me all the banter, and angst, and feminine banter didn't equate to a new voice in literature, like the critics were claiming this was. Degrassi high references, and punk haircuts, and cutting arms, and a blood oath, it was the Ya-Ya sisterhood on crack, but not as amusing or heartfelt. At the end, the big secret, was a let down, I would have to say it wasn't worth the read what so ever. dissapointed.	2005-09-16

PARENTS BE WARNED	This book is in the Young Adult Fiction section at the library. When I was a young adult, I was reading Tolkien, Piers Anthony and those books that you could pick what was going to happen next, these days young adults are being forced to become adults too fast. I heard about Gossip Girls from a talk show I listen to everyday. Glenn Beck the host, he was saying how he would never ever let his daughters read this book because it's not for children, and I do consider the 15-up age recommendation to include children. I read the book, and I have to agree, it's not anything a young girl should be reading because it has no lasting value whatsoever. It doesn't teach a lesson, the story has no point to it, and the impressions it leaves are hurtful to young psyches. PLUS it's the worst writing I have seen in awhile, I am talking 4th grade level grammar, sentences, and diction. The whole book is about rich spoiled teenagers, who have a lot of sex, shop a lot, gossip a lot and have no character what so ever, if I were a parent and knew my child was absorbing all this nonsense and thought that maybe this was an okay way to act I would blow my top. What kills me, is that the book has sequels...many of them...and people are either buying them for their children without knowing what they are about which is bad parenting, or their kids are buying them and parents are just turning a blind eye to what is in their children's lives.  Either way let it be known that kids are influenced by Television, Movies, Music and what they Read...and although it's wonderful to have your children reading books, you as an Parent should know what they are reading. ANY doubt at all , read the book first, then make that decision. (seriously this is like soft soft porn)	2005-09-13

I was so happy with this book on so many levels, It had great character development right off, it grabbed my attention immediatly from page one, it didnt lull in the middle, the story was a familiar one but cast in a different light. I read it in one sitting because I could not put it down. I saw some of the reviewers compared it to Buffy, but Wendy isnt even close to being Buffy she is so much more mature and smarter and you dont get all the angst that went along with Buffys character. There is great sexual tension between her and alex, I especially loved the part where they got naked to cast some spells, I could feel the spark between them. The witches were the best part, detailed, I could actually smell them when i read about thier looks and demeanors. I cannot wait to read the next two books!	2005-08-11

QUIRKY? NOT WORTH MY TIME!. This author Julie Kenner, as far as I know was a working stiff, became a stay at home mom, and decided to write a book over a period of a couple of years. This book failed to capture my attention, it was so completely unoriginal in its prose and atmosphere, PLUS she is so out of touch with the \\"buffy\\" generation or older that this book is geared towards. I dont know ANY TEENAGE GIRL IN 2005 that listens to NATALIE IMBRUGLIA!!!!! or who wants to shop anymore at BANANA REPUBLIC!! that is so 1991, the story was lame, the characters very shallow, skip this and read \\"dead witch walking\\" by kim harrison.	2005-08-01

I have read McCammon before and wasnt all that impressed but thought I would give this a try because I love vampire novels. It started out really well,peaked my interest, then it slowed down with all the introductions of all the different characters, the cop, the thug, the reporter, the lowlife, the pregnant teenager,In other words the regular lineup for these types of books. I was waiting for something to happen, for it to be creepy or dramatic, or even to just make me want to keep reading it, and NOTHING HAPPENED> some grave robbing (yawn) a serial killer (stretch) the ghost of a mother long dead (yawn, and stretch) at that point I would have been happy if Count Chocula came out and made everyone breakfast, but he didnt. So I put the book down and started on another vampire novel.	2005-07-21
