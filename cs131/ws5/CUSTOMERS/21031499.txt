I as satisfied with this book but a lil dissapointed. I was glad the Morgan still contacted her adopted family and Bree and Robbie. I was satisfied that the book mentioned what was going on with them and how they were along with some of the blood witches that were in the series. I was dissapointed that it didn't tell us how Alisa was doing or if she was still into Wicca or if she was initiated. Also some of the coven members from Kithic were not even mentioned. I was glad that Killian stay close to Morgan but his mother and other brother and sister were really mean to Morgan. Ciaran was mean to Morgan before he died. She had to do what she had to do. Iona is a bitch. Morgan is the Destroyer, the sguiurs dan. Morgan is like her birth father but she is the good version of him. Morgan can heal and destroy. There is a light and dark side to everything. Everything has to be in balance. Moira seems to have inheritied a lot of her mothers power. They both live in Ireland and Morgan has rebuild Belwicket along with some of the members that had survived the dark wave. Hunter is also in this book and so is Sky. Morgan is the most powerful witch that anyone has ever know. This book is good so I gave it 3 1/2 stars because of some of my dissapointments. Read to see what happens to Morgan, Hunter, and her daughter.	2005-03-02
