I first read The Luckiest Man, a new book out about Lou Gehrig which heavily quotes from this book written by Lou Gehrig's wife before her death. It is such a fun book! I LOVED all the info about Chicago in the Roaring Twenties (Mrs. Gehrig was a party-girl flapper) and also in the Depression of the 1930s, when she marries baseball great Lou Gehrig. It is a very honest book. Mrs. Gehrig writes extensively about her sour relationship with Lou's mom, who was very controlling. They got married on the spur of the moment so she couldn't step in and ruin the wedding! His illness and quick death from ALS is covered in the last chapters. It's obvious she loved him very much. Babe Ruth gets quite a lot of mention, as well as what being a baseball player back then was like. Before all the huge money that baseball players make nowadays, players would play all of over the country against non-professional teams in order to make more money. Lou was so grateful to be making any money after a poor immigrant childhood, that he almost never tried to negotiate his contracts. He just signed for whatever the team offered him. Consequently, Babe Ruth made twice as much as he did! Lou never stayed out past the team's curfew, while Babe Ruth partied all night with girls. Lou Gehrig comes across as a standup guy, worthy of honor. Not too many athletes these days are. He is humble, quiet and gracious in the face of adversity (his paralyzing and fatal illness).	2005-09-21

The police and the DA's office are supposed to give the defense lawyers all the evidence they uncover, but in this case they kept silent any info that didn't help prove the railroaded defendent was guilty. He was set up by a rival criminal in the neighborhood who was a police informant. The police actually gave him a regular paycheck in exchange for info on crimes. The book is interesting because it doesn't paint the exonerated man, Curtis Kyles, as an innocent man. It goes into all his criminal activity, selling drugs, selling stolen goods, and robbing people on the street. I think that he had planned to sell the gun and other items from the crime, the shooting death of an older lady out shopping at a discount grocery store in broad daylight. The police informant was found driving around in the dead lady's car, and soon pinned the killing on Curtis. After 4 trials with hung juries, the DA in New Orleans, Henry Connick, Jr's dad, conceded defeat and Curtis was allowed to go free. The book is written by a local newspaper reporter and does a good job describing the racism in the city. The book describes in detail life inside the Orleans Parish Prison, the local New Orleans jail full of violence and rapes, and on death row in Angola.	2005-04-28
US	52287623	R172WKFA4G1N5C	034546169X	676547106	Home Fires Burning: Married to the Military--for Better or Worse	Books	3	2	6	N	Y	I'm only giving 3 stars because the book isn't very in-depth	The author spent 3 years interviewing different military wives, but the way she writes makes it seem like several short college papers thrown together. Instead of solely concentrating on the person she writes about in each chapter, she throws in a lot of quotes, statistics and her own unanswered questions which get in the way of learning about the real-life military spouse. The profile of Crystal, a low-income teenager who's Army husband is gone in Afghanistan while she sits alone in a crummy apartment on base watching cartoons with 2 little kids is the highlight of the book. Other chapters seem to lead nowhere, such as one chapter about books in the 1940s that coached Army wives to take immaculate care of the house and never complain. I kept wanting to read the actual 1940s book rather than this book! I think the author is slanted towards dissing the military life, which she admits she fled without a look back after growing up an Air Force brat. She blames the military for downplaying domestic violence on base, for instructing soldiers not to tell their wives the gritty details about their war experiences, for telling the wives to not complain about anything, and for promoting itself as family-oriented when she feels it isn't. I don't think any of these issues is surprising. There's a few details about what the base housing is like, and what the Family Readiness Groups are like (support groups for the wives when the husbands are deployed), but if you don't have a background in military life you won't learn much here.	2005-04-20

I bought a copy of this at Walgreens when I was desperate for something to read. I thought it would be just a recap of everything in the news about Saddam's capture, but it was more than that. The book is actually not about Saddam's capture - that's only the last chapter. The rest is written by various people, a Fox TV guy, a military commander and the author, and follows various military engagements across Iraq. It's very interesting to hear what people who've actually been there have to say! The book is rah-rah military, and that may turn some readers off. I got a much better perspective on how hard it's been for our military to do their job in Iraq, with the culture being so entirely different from ours and with the hatred of Americans. I learned that Iran is supporting the Shia in southern Iraq, that millions of dollars of cash has been found in terrorist hands, and that most Iraqis feared Saddam and had relatives tortured and killed by him. To capture Saddam, the military studied the interconnected tribal families at the top of the social ladder in his hometown of Tikrit. They thought they would be protecting him, and they were right. More interesting was the description of all the roadside bombs, some made from electronic toy cars and from cell phone parts, and hidden in Kleenex boxes and cinder blocks tossed onto the edge of the road. It's not going to win a Pulitzer prize, but you should learn a few things about the fighting in Iraq.	2005-04-02

He bedded just about every movie star and starlet of his era. He made gazilions of dollars from his tool company. This book also details the sad end to his life, which it attributes to his brain being scarred from syphilis, his obsessive compulsive disorder, his brain injuries from numerous plane crashes, and being hooked on pain killers. It seems business associates surrounded him, destroyed his will which probably left his money to his medical research charity, and hastened his death by keeping him dehydrated, hungry, and overdosed on liquid codeine. Read the book!	2005-03-19

It's not often that Amish children or adults are seen in photos because it is against their religion for adult members of the church to have photos taken which show their face (their interpretation of the Bible considers this vanity). It's a little questionable then that there are photos of a few Amish adult faces. The photographer mentions that when he first started taking these photos, he didn't know it was forbidden in the Amish religion. The Amish farm kids (not members of the church yet) got the OK from their parents to be in a few photos, according to the photographer. Some of the photos show the backs of children only, dressed in the simple Amish clothes and walking to school barefoot or working on the farm. Many of the photos are shot at quite a distance, with the photographer apparently standing on a public road in Amish country and snapping photos. There are many pictures of Amish barns and farmhouses. It's a nice book to flip through, but because there is no wording on the pages (beyond a quick intro in the front) it doesn't warrant a second and third look. My favorite Amish book is by Elizabeth Coblentz and includes full-page photos plus copies of her columns in an Amish newspaper about life on her family's farm.	2005-02-19

A true life story, Mafia Childhood is written by 2 kids who's dad was in the Mob in New Jersey and had to flee into the Witness Protection program for knowing too much about a huge heist of money. The kids get dragged along, learning their new names and new life stories so they can hide out in plain sight in low-key communities in the states of Kentucky, Nebraska, and Washington state. I like the boy's remembrances - he was a sarcastic, angry teenager at the time while his younger sister's memories are more idealized. Their dad was amazingly violent and also hooked on the drugs he was selling, making the mob life seem not so glamorous after all.	2005-01-19

The Green River Killer killed dozens of prostitutes in the Seattle area in the 80s. He was finally caught when DNA technology advanced and samples were sent in to be analyzed. The book is very creepy. Gary Ridgeway, the killer, was able to go undetected for over a decade because he lived a basic American life: job, family, homeowner. I think another good book angle about this case would be just how the cops overlooked Gary Ridgeway even after eyewitnesses described his truck numerous times, one victim's family led the police directly to his door, he was investigated and given polygraph tests, and was stopped by police for using prostitutes a couple times. This makes the book even more gripping and horrible, as more and more prostitutes go missing (sometimes one a week) even as the police have put the killer on their short list of suspects.	2005-01-01

This is different than your average sports book because some of the chapters are written by Brett's mom and wife and by Brett himself. Since his mom co-authored the book, she included adorable baby photos of Brett and family photos of his wife and kids. Brett's wife writes about the Favre family charity fund which helps disabled and less fortunate kids in both WI and MS. His mom writes about the Favre family obsession with football (Brett's dad is a coach) and how she spent her life going to EVERY one of Brett's games, missing only one when she couldn't get a flight. I think Wisconsin Packer fans will relate to the simple smalltown life in the bayous of Mississippi that the Favre family writes about.	2005-01-01

I love all fighter pilot books, and this one is good (my all-time favorite is still Bogeys and Bandits). The author describes about 5 new pilots in training and about 5 of their flight instructors at an Air Force base in Arizona. The book just came out, so the stories are current. There's the surfer dude pilot, the rare woman pilot, the yes-sir/no-sir military guy pilot and so on. The author spends most of his time describing their actual flights as they learn how to fly the Viper (F-16) so you get a good feel for their mistakes and the difficulty in learning all the complexities of not only flying the jet but using it's missiles and bombs. The author is plenty gung-ho about the fighter pilot world - describing them as \\"ball-busting badasses\\" on the 1st page. I don't think the previous 1-star reviews by a pilot and the pilot's wife who think the author dissed him in the book are relevent to the book's actual goodness or badness - most people who read this book will enjoy it.	2004-12-08

I was stunned by the stories of abuse of women in the Middle East. I like that the book is laid out by country, so you get a glimpse of life in each Middle Eastern country, personal stories of women there, and also info about the political regime in that country and whether the author feels that the country's leaders are truly religious or just using Muslim extremists to keep their citizens at bay.

I love this book because you can quickly learn about all the major periods of art - from the Renaissance's oil paintings to today's modern sculpture works. I recommend reading this before you go to an art museum, so you can brush up on who is famous for what. There are a few black and white photos of famous artwork, but mostly the book explains the type of art produced during each period, and the top 5 or so artists and what their most famous works are.	2004-11-18

This is one of my favorite books I've ever read. It's amazing to hear how sexist the Saudi regime is with their women in this day and age! The abuse that is allowed, with no repercussions because men are treated as kings and all women are seen as their property, is unbelievable. Many women are under the total control of the men in their family, and risk death or imprisonment if they try to flee. You really need to read it to believe that a whole society lives this way! You will have a new appreciation for your life and freedoms after you read these sad tales of women married off to abusive men twice their age who have other wives as well. They must stay veiled when outside and stay in separate rooms in the household for women when male visitors are over. That is why the book is called \\"Life Behind the Veil.\\"	2004-11-18

Also, it's really fun to reminisce about one-hit wonders from the 80s that were played on MTV constantly. Good for anyone who is really into rock music.

Because Shepard himself never wrote an autobiography and gave few interviews, a lot of his life was loosely pieced together. It made me wonder if now, from beyond the grave, Shepard wishes he had just written a book himself so he could set the story straight! The lives of the 1st waves of astronauts is always interesting to read about, even though it was before my time. They were revered as celebrities and heroes, getting the covers of Life magazine, and ticker tape parades. This book does uncover some of the partying and hard living in Cocoa Beach that the newsmen of the day kept secret to protect the hero status of the astronauts.	2004-11-11

I bought this for my grade school aged niece (it's a young adult readers book), but decided to read it first. Who can forget Bethany's story of getting her arm bit off by a huge shark? It was interesting to learn about her family. Both of her parents moved to Hawaii when they were young to follow their passion for surfing. They met up while working at the island's resorts, and raised their kids to surf as soon as they could. Bethany is a very accomplished surfer, with endorsements from surfing clothes and board manufacturers, and it's uplifting to know she is still surfing and still doing well in competitions after the accident. Bethany mentions that she is happy to do interviews (which she admits are tedious) as long as she can mention what Christ has done for her life.	2004-11-11

It was an amazing undertaking, with belly dancers imported from the Middle East, and Lapplanders from the Arctic Circle. The other half of the book is a quicker read, about a serial killer. It's gruesome and unbelievable how many unsuspecting women, children and even a few men that he would insure for money and then kill.	2004-08-31

I was surprised at the sex and drugs in Hollywood even in the 50s! The 2 best parts of the book are reading about Natalie's very eccentric Russian mother who was a pushy stage mom, and reading about Natalie's lifelong fear of drowning in dark water which did eventually come true. The mystery around her death is very intriguing. Was it just a drunken mistake that her husband RJ did not to call the Coast Guard earlier? Could the people on neighboring boats have saved her if only their inflatable dinghy had not been stored away deflated? If she hadn't been drinking heavily that night, would Natalie have fallen overboard? Like all accidents, there are a lot of \\"what ifs.\\" She had a very interesting life, with lots of husbands and lovers, and lots of friends who were also famous movie stars like James Dean.

The advice the author shares is common-sense advice that we all know we should be following, but often we get off-track and too negative. Each chapter is short and to-the-point, with lots of cartoon illustrations. I have underlined almost the entire book, because each page offers more great advice. For instance, the first page I flipped to says this: \\"A person embarking on a day's march would be foolish to carry enough provisions for a lifetime. Is it not strange, then, that many people carry around all their worries for the next 20 years and wonder why life is so difficult?\\" The author has several other books out there, but this is his best.	2004-08-11

It's an oversize book so you get some huge photos of space! You'll see the astronauts floating around and doing their work, too, but the best photos are of the earth and its amazing beauty when seen from a distance. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is, like a lot of high-quality picture books, the text isn't the best. Some of the astronauts are good writers and write great entries about how being in space changed them - made them appreciate life more, and so on - but other entries are dry and could have been edited out. Also, the astronaut writing the page has their photo somewhere in the book, but not on the same page as their writing. It's hard to keep track of who wrote what unless you take the time to flip back and forth to the index, look up the astronaut's photo, and compare that to their writing. The actual shuttle itself and how it works is not covered much until the final couple pages which do include a good graphic about the shuttle's parts.	2004-07-26

The authors are veteran space journalists and were able to get interviews that no one else did. The retelling of how the critical information about the foam strike never got anywhere past a few bobbled opportunities to discuss how dangerous these foam strikes could be is fascinating.

I didn't enjoy reading this book of phrases because most of the French expressions were far too advanced for me. I had French in high school and German in college but I pick things up quickly and thought I would be OK with this book. The book is not a good reference for flipping through because a lot of the phrases are just not something you will ever run across while reading literature or even while in France on vacation. Also, it would be impossible to memorize these long phrases and put them to use unless you are very, very advanced in French. The title, Bon Mots (good words): How to Amaze Tout Le Monde (everyone) with Everyday French is misleading. This is not everyday French.	2004-07-25

I found some of the advice about looking good, wearing skirts and dressing in pastel colors, a throwback to the 50s when women were taught how to land a husband! It is true that men will respond to a lady dressed up in a short skirt and high heels, but is that your only goal in life? The book actually makes men sound like they have a brain the size of a fish's - they respond to a wiggling worm (sexy girl) who plays the line a little (plays hard to get). It's a little distressing if this is true. What about equality and getting to know each other as friends? Some of the back pages are very funny, but I don't think this is serious advice that you should listen to.	2004-07-25

A much better book in the same vein is Southern Belle Primer, which goes into lots of detail about silverware patterns, wedding present displays, and charm school.	2004-07-25

All the DK Eyewitness books are page after page of photos, with lots of good info packed in. Since there aren't many photos from the American Revolution era, more paintings and drawings are used here, but they are all very detailed and colorful. Items which I've heard about but never seen before, such as Spanish silver coins that the Colonists would literally cut in half to make change, are shown in close-up. Very educational for kids, and adults!	2004-07-23

The cooks and owners get interviewed, and many photos of both the restaurant and the food they serve are in the book. Some of the recipes are for basic things like Deviled Eggs that you may not need, but others are interesting Southern specialties like Tea Sandwiches and Coca-Cola Cake with Peanut Frosting! I enjoyed just reading about Southern dishes like Fried Okra and Chicken-Fried Steak, which I've never had.	2004-07-23

The book is short and simple, intended for grade schoolers, but the info is very interesting (for a tooth brush, chew up the end of a licorice root until it gets bristly and rub against teeth) and the photos are amazing (printed at half-page size so you can see them well - includes battle scenes). Even includes a recipe for hardtack crackers which the soldiers lived on. A great book to keep on hand for kids to look thru (and adults!).	2004-07-11

One of my favorite books growing up was a companion book in this series, called If You Lived in Colonial Times. The illustrations in all of these books is the best! Detailed drawings show what clothes the adults and kids would be wearing. Each page answers a different question like, \\"What happened when a child misbehaves?\\" Kids can learn a lot from these books. I plan to collect all of them for my children.	2004-07-11

I loved this book and recommend it as the best in its category of books about Navy pilots. A lot happens to each of the pilots-in-training that are covered. I learned a lot about how pilots are trained and what their day-to-day life is like (very busy!). A lot of the parts were very interesting, such as when the author talks about pilots who quit the Navy after all the expensive and difficult training has been given to them, and about going in front of review boards in danger of losing your wings after a particularly scary performance in the air, or even giving up your wings voluntarily if you grow to fear the &quot;smoking hole in the ground&quot; too much (what you'll end up as if you crash your jet and can't eject safely.) Could easily be made into a great movie.	2004-05-02

Read Bogeys and Bandits instead, or Iron Claw. I just skimmed through this book and it was still a chore to read it. The author throws in a new character every chapter, without giving the reader any idea who this person is. There are better books out there.	2004-05-02

The best parts of the book are when he describes the people he works with on the ship. He does a good job of bringing these people to life, and telling about his difficulties dealing with the higher-ups onboard and their intimidating leadership styles. That was very honest of him, but he didn't reveal much about why he decided to leave the Navy and go into business just a few years later. Overall, it's a good book. I recommend Bogeys and Bandits as the best Navy pilot book.	2004-05-02

TV news covered the Columbia breakup relentlessly, yet we haven't heard much from the families of the astronauts involved. This book fills the void by retelling the Husband's marriage and family life. It's a bit narrow in its scope - it's really not about NASA or the space shuttle program but only about Rick Husband's personal life as told by his wife.	2004-02-03

All of the \\"If you Lived at the Time of...\\" books are great for kids, and also a nice, quick read for adults! What I like about them is their layout, which is easy for readers to follow. Each page begins with a question, \\"Would you have seen a battle in the South?\\" for example. Nicely drawn illustrations accompany each answer. The book itself is small and lightweight enough to be handled easily by kids. Issues between the North and South are explained simply and, I believe, fairly.	2004-01-07

This guidebook does a good job of presenting its information in a concise, meaningful way. You can easily flip through its well-marked sections and feel as if you are taking a trip all over Virginia! I like that each section (History, Shopping) starts with a quick intro, telling you the overall feel of that area. It's not afraid to tell you that one city is more known for its nightlife while another is known for its shopping malls. The beginning of the book includes an overall look at Virginian history, major cities, climate, major roadways and wildlife - great information for newcomers to have!	2004-01-07

This book includes great photos of Civil War soldiers in their uniforms. It also has photos of soldiers lying dead on a battlefield and a Southern home riddled with holes from canon fire, photos I had never seen in my history books. It has good, close-up photos and drawings of the guns, grenades, hardtack biscuits and other everyday items used by soldiers back then. Very interesting!	2004-01-07

If anything, this guide book has too much information! It's packed full of info on restaurants, places to visit, hotels, the military, Colonial Williamsburg and so on, all in great detail. You'll need to spend some serious time on the couch to read through all of it! I like that it includes info that people who are just visiting Williamsburg will need, plus the info that those thinking of moving to Williamsburg will need (neighborhoods, hospitals, and daycares). Does a good job of giving detailed descriptions of hotels and restaurants so travellers can narrow down their options. Also includes interesting cultural issues like Southern food and the Native American heritage and how to pronounce local words correctly.	2004-01-07

Autobiographies are fun to read because people spill their guts and tell you all the secrets and failures that they normally wouldn't admit to.This author had quite an interesting life, growing up in NYC and becoming a bigtime music industry insider, marrying and divorcing and so forth.

The untold story.	I watch TV news religiously, both network and cable, and I was unaware of the magnitude of war crimes taking place in the Serbo-Croation war, and of the U.N.'s dismal efforts to sustain peace and help those in danger of ethnic cleansing (read execution into pre-dug mass graves) and the ramifications of the U.S. under Clinton not fighting to save lives as Slobodan Milosevic and others carried on these atrocities.This book inspired me to sponsor a Muslim Bosnian woman through a support organization.

The prayers include some you are bound to know, plus many, many new ones. I like that there is a good mix of short prayers and longer devotions.

I thought it would be a fun book to help me re-enter the Chronicles of Narnia world, but there aren't any short summaries of the books and their meaning.

I find I don't use this Bible as much as my other 2 because it's rather bulky and unwieldy to hold on to. The pages are very thin. I actually use this Bible to write notes in and underline passages as its not my best copy. Other reviewers have liked the footnotes in this Bible version - I never bother to read them! They add to the bulk of the book and some take up almost half the page, meaning there's a lot of pages you have to flip through to get to what you want to read.	2003-12-28

Extremely funny and gives you a true insider's look into the infamous Enron. The author has a great sense of humor about life, considering he was on the inside, making great money, and soon found himself jobless in the wake of the scandals. I give him extra credit for landing on his feet by writing this book! He explains some of the extreme cockiness and spend-thrift ways of his coworkers and his mysterious, anonymous mentor.	2003-12-28

I own other Essential Handbooks (Lenten, Mary) and they are all great! I found this one interesting in its portrayal of how to be Catholic, even though I grew up Catholic! The book's version is quite warm and fuzzy, stressing helping others and so forth. Growing up in Catholic schools, I lived being Catholic but I never read a book about how to be Catholic. A lot of the things in the glossary and explained in the book I knew about to a degree from hearing them somewhere as a child, without knowing their full meaning or the reasoning behind the practice. I found the book very uplifting, and a good reminder for adults on what's important in life: the simplicity of being a good person.	2003-12-28

Not being a terribly religious person when I read this book, I was almost embarassed to buy it but I'm glad I did. It truly got me to thinking about what is possible in this world and if I believe in Mary, why not be open to the possibility that she is still here with us, warning us to be faithful as she did at Fatima? A very objective book, about the author's travels to Medjugorje, Yugoslavia prior to the Bosnian war. It'll definitely make you think.	2003-12-28

I really didn't know much about the Mormon religion before reading this, and it truly gives the religion a positive spin, which you don't always find when it comes to this religion in the media!

I bought this because I've seen the author on Larry King and elsewhere talking about how she reads potential jurors by their body language. She's made a lot of money doing this, and recommending jurors to lawyers. It was all very interesting until I bought this slapped together book.

From the title, you wouldn't guess that this book was written in defense of the author's religion and in a way against the Mormon religion. It is her life in the 60s at BYU. She isn't Mormon when she arrives and she isn't Mormon when she leaves.

It's tough to read a book of someone's opinions on where to live as its really a heartfelt decision each person needs to make for themselves. But most of this book is straight statistics, such as weather and crime. The book is big and leaves enough room for each metro area so you can read the climate graphs without too much eyestrain. It's the best book on deciding where to move that I found. I took tons of notes from this book, and it actually helped me pick an entirely new place to live than the ones I had originally thought of!

I enjoyed breezing through this book, but it's really targeted to people with no prior experience with the Bible whatsoever. There are better books out there. I recommend Idiot's Guide to the Bible, which has more depth.	2003-12-27
US	52287623	R7BW1WPBR0FVX	1573801313	879922491	The Insiders' Guide to Virginia Beach	Books	4	4	5	N	Y	Good if you're thinking of moving to VB area.	I'm thinking of moving to VB area, and this book has lots of basic info on the area, including neighborhoods, beaches and the like. The author does live in the area, so she seems to know what she's talking about. However, I feel that she held back from offering opinions, saying this beach is cleaner and less crowded than that beach, for example. I have since tried quite a few of the restaurants she lists, and all of them were very good! The best book about VB I've been able to find.	2003-12-27

This is a book missionaries should give out to new members! It and its companion books excerpt the Encyclopedia of Mormonism, a very expensive set to buy. These indiviual books are well worth it! Search through the basics about Jesus that the church teaches.	2003-12-27

I didn't know much about Robert Schuller before I read this (he is a TV preacher who believes in the power of positive thinking), but I really liked his autobiography. It's a good book. I especially liked the retelling of his growing up on a farm, and his and his wife's early days with their \\"drive-in\\" church in California.	2003-12-27

I'm moving to the South so I thought I should learn a few things about the culture. I learned a few new things, but a lot of this book is just fluff - bland lists of things you don't need to know. Lists of football championships, who to mail-order hams from, etc. I did like the info dealing with Southern religions as I didn't know much about the difference between say Baptists and Holy Rollers.	2003-12-27

I'm moving to the South so I thought I should learn a few things about the culture. This book was a perfect introduction. Short and sweet, it doesn't take itself seriously. I heard about things new to me, like competition to get into the Junior League and picking out your silverware pattern before you're even engaged! Fun to read.	2003-12-27

I had fun flipping through this book and reading phrases in all sorts of languages, including Latin, some of which I found I had the wrong idea of what they meant! If you've studied say German, you'll recognize and know the simple phrases in that chapter, but there's still French, Italian and so on to learn from.	2003-12-27

OK, this is a kid's book, but I bought it to learn more about the Mormon religion. Each page has a small kiddie illustration, then the meaning of a word, going alphabetically. Good information. Includes some of the important Bible people and a lot of Mormon-only words and traditions that newcomers may not know.	2003-12-27

Another great book from the Encyclopedia of Mormonism. This and the other books put a lot of info in one book. They take certain sections from the Encyclopedia (which is super expensive to buy) and reprint them. Will tell you a lot about what the Mormon church believes. Recommended for those thinking about joining the church and for new converts!	2003-12-27

The Idiot books manage to pack in lots of info, with sidebars and so on mixed in throughout the book. Every area of the Bible is well-covered. I have kept this as my Bible reference book. The chapter on the Book of Revelation is the first place I've ever seen someone make any sense out of it!	2003-12-27

This book is very pretty, with lots of huge photos. It's really more than a cookbook - it includes many columns about the author's Amish life. Made me want to live on a farm!	2003-12-22

The butler knows her life very well, and, according to his book, was one of Princess Di's closest friends. She confided in him, and let him read her private letters and even listen in on phone calls. He also offers an interesting inside view of life inside the Queen's Palace and Prince Charles' Highgrove estate, both of which he worked at.	2003-11-06

The author, Gracia, was very honest in what day-to-day life in the jungle was like, traipsing thru the woods with her captors day and night with little to eat. She and her husband had a few chances to escape but chose to stay together and wait it out. They were in the jungle for over a year! Very interesting story.	2003-10-04

The book has lots of fun questions and the answers are very informative. The longer answers include a 2nd sidebar of info. Includes the basic questions that most space enthusiasts should know plus more in-depth questions. Some about the shuttle, the early Gemini and Mercury missions, Apollo and also planet-related questions. Worth reading and a good reference book, when you need to know the dimensions of the shuttle payload bay, for example (15 feet by 60 feet).	2003-08-17

My mom and I read it and were really captivated by the world of LA in the 1940s, a time of police working hand-in-hand with gangsters to give the city what it wanted: gambling, illegal abortions, prostitutes. The author paints a vivid picture of his father (deceased) as the Dahlia killer, as well as numerous other similar slayings, who because of his knowledge of underworld affairs within the highest echelons of LA was allowed to roam free. It is mostly circumstantial evidence but as a whole the story is complete. I will be waiting to see if anyone who can speak on the evidence locked up in the case files owned by the LAPD and the DA's office will come forward to the media and say that, yes, Dr. George Hodel was known to be the Black Dahlia serial killer.	2003-06-20

This book has a sweetness about it that makes it an enjoyable read. I took a few notes on the book as I was reading it, and feel the author makes some great points in a way that's easy to remember. I am interested in now reading some of the author's other books. A quick read and a positive message.	2003-06-18

Bruce and Stan keep things rolling along with their lighthearted approach to Bible study. Their book is compact - easy to hold and read or throw into a backpack without it weighing a ton. It really has a way of bringing the important points together in as short a way as possible (includes the entire Bible in an overview to be read in under 25 minutes). Also includes a handy list of concordances like where to find info on &quot;friendship&quot; or &quot;disappointment&quot; within the Bible.	2003-05-16

This book is the best I've read about NASA/spaceflight - it's never slow and boring like some space books. It's a true autobiography as he includes some details about his personal life, his marriage and relationship with his kids which makes Mr. Krantz a likable figure as he is honest about the effects of his long work days at NASA. This book covers the early days, the 60s and a bit before that, just when Johnson Space Center and NASA itself got started. Good look back at what Krantz himself calls the heyday of America's space program.	2003-05-16

This book has a great layout, with little columns off to the side featuring bits of extra info. The print is large and the layout is uncluttered, so even though there's lots of ground to cover, you can skim thru without getting a headache. Each chapter has a good amount of information, not too much to bore the reader and not too little to make it not worth reading. Written in a carefree but informative style.	2003-05-16

I thought the book was great. It quickly explained to me how music is made  up of notes from chosen chord progressions and scales. I love the book  because it is short and written in boldy formatted paragraphs with diagrams  of piano keys and guitar frets. It's a small, slim hardcover book so it's  great to take along and read over coffee. It is a very basic book but it  does what few writers are able to do: say exactly what needs to be said in  as short a time space as possible! I think the author did a great job. I am  now searching for my second music theory book, to keep learning about how  music is actually created.	2000-09-13

I hadn't read a Joyce Carol Oates book before and read this because it is about Marilyn Monroe. It turned out to be one of the best books I have ever read. The way Oates wrote it is brilliant. You feel you are inside  Marilyn's head and seeing her life as she lives it. A great book for all  women to read to think about how they feel about men and sex. Without  making Marilyn appear weak, it shows the true sadness of her life from an  orphaned girl of a mentally unstable mother to a likely  murdered-by-powerful-men-before-she-could-expose-them-to-the-media  sexpot.	2000-07-07
