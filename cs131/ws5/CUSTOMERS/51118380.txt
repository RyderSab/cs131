He can string words together - make no doubt about it.  However where his book comes apart is in his research.  The historical claims he makes in his book are not taken from a balanced library of sources.  He focuses primarily on excommunitcated Mormon historians, although he does bring in some active Mormon research, primarily from Mr. Bushman.  I can only belive that Mr. Krakauer himself was aware of the sources he was taking his information from, because his book contains only a bibliography and a simple chapter by chapter acknowledgment of what books were used for each chapter.  The author does not endnote or footnote any of his claims.  To me this raises the concern that he focused too much on historians Brodie and Quinn, whom he references throughout the book as being the quinessential Mormon historians, despite the fact that they were both excommunicated, a fact which further raises questions of their intents and desires in writing their histories.  One example of Krakauers' poor scholarship is shown when he pronounces Mark E. Peterson as the President of the LDS church, when in fact Mr. Peterson was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.  Further, he asserts with boldness the sexual proclivities of Joseph Smith (more than likely drawn from Ms. Brodie's book) without acknowledging that such assertions are not broadly accepted or supported by practicing LDS church members.  He does not even cite as a source for his book LDS scholar Hugh Nibley's \\"No Ma'am, That's Not History,\\" a treatise which calls into question much of Ms. Brodie's scholarship.  <br />Mr. Krakauer's book works as a story - but there is too much missing or added to discount it entirely as an accurate historical work.  Although he may not have intended to write a \\"history\\" of Mormons, it is in fact what he did - but he did it based on unbalanced research, which results in a book that is not clear orcorrect.	2004-01-12

Since it won the Pulitzer Prize my desire to read it has only intensified.  When I finally found the time to read this book, I was somewhat disappointed.  This is a good memoir of a fascinating woman.  It documents very well her personal and professional struggles.  But, it is slightly boring and full of self-depricating comments that seem aimed at making the common man identify with the author, whose lifestyle is unknown to most readers of her book.  It is a good book, but not as hot as I had thought it would be.	2003-08-12

The scope of this book seems so much larger than it's 700 plus pages, but Mr. McCullough does an incredible job at keeping this book focused on important details.

This book shows the effects of genocide and terror through the eyes of a little girl surrounded by daily events of murder and death, disease and death, torture and death, and starvation and death.  This is an important book, because it brings to light events which occurred during the turbulent Vietnam era.

Roberts seven volume history  of the LDS church and its' people.  It is a book that casts itself as an  introductory one volume history of what is today called Mormon history.  I  am a Mormon.  I have read histories of the LDS church that deal with the  subject in a very negative and also positive ways.  This book is well  balanced and honest in its presentation of the subject.  I read this book  in order to better understand how all of the pieces of Mormon history fit  together.  I found what I was looking for.  This book does not go into  detail about the minutiae of Mormon history, nor does it make assumptions  in order to drive a point home.  The authors deal with historical research  and nothing else.  <br />This book is not a history of the Mormon faith, it is  a history of the Mormon church and the Mormon people.  It does not attempt  to convert, but rather to explain.  The book is not trying to define what  Mormon's believe, but rather who they are, and what the have done.	2000-08-22

This book details the relationship between Dr. King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and other African-American Civil Rights groups better than any  book I have read.  The author is at his best when discussing the political  movement MLK, rather than the personal MLK.  But, this book is not a  biography of MLK.  It is, as the first, a history of a time period set  around an influential individual, in this case, Dr. Martin Luther King.   This book brings to life, the movement for equality, after it had broken  out of its infancy to become of powerful force of civil and political  change.

John Marshall defined American law, politics and power.  This book paints a vivid picture of who Marshall was, and why he is still important today.  The author does an excellent job stating the facts and letting the reader  decide for her/himself whether or not Marshall did the right or wrong in  the very important decisions he made.  This book is enlightening and well  written.  Marshall's life is wonderfully told through the authors use of  clear and concise writing.  This book is excellent.  It clarifies many  misconceptions of this great man who came out of a generation that claims  many great men.  Marshall may be the least understood of them all, but he  certainly is no less important than any of his contemporaries in forming  and defining the United States of America.	2000-06-23

The portion on Washington's morals is good, but is more philosophical and  religious than historical.

It is an excellent book that fizzles out at the end.  The only other problem is that Wills begins taking issue with the works of Mc Pherson and  never truly substantiates his claims.  To me it appeared that Wills has  some point of contention with Mc Pherson, but he never fully develops the  conflict.      Wills book is not long, but it is very detailed and loaded.   When reading this book you can tell that the words were chosen very  carefully by the author.  It is THE book on the Gettysburg address.	2000-05-25

These were both covered in this  book.  Carroll does a good job telling a story.  His book falls apart when  discussing the emotions of the time.  It left me unconvinced of his  sincerity behind the themes of the book.  He &quot;drops names&quot; of  people he knew in the anti war movement as if to give himself validity.  It  seemed to be an attempt at grasping for legitimacy as the rebel son of a  powerful government figure.  Certainly he only needed to tell the story and  let the facts speak for legitimacy.

I purchased it.  I should have checked it out from the library.  It takes about 90-120 minutes to read, and is very touching.  It would help if some of the money being paid was going to research on Lou Gehrigs Disease.  Unfortunately it is most likely  going to pad the pocket of the author and publishers.  This takes away some  of the pure emotion of the book (in my opinion).  I am going to circulate  my copy to friends because it is such a touching story.  However, I am not  going to encourage them to pay for it, because it is not a book that  will ever earn that kind of price in its use.  The book's content is a  touching story of life and death.

Ms. Hill does a good job of telling the history without being too partisan (pro/anti mormon), unlike the two preceding major biographies of Joseph Smith.  However, she falls  into the trap in many instances of not going into enough detail, and not  elaborating enough.  This book seemed to me too rushed and incomplete.  It  is a good introduction to the life of Joseph Smith, but it left me feeling  that I still did not know who the man was that she was writing about.  This  is not an earth-shattering biography, but merely a good biography.  Other  reviewers who have been astounded by this work, I believe, over-reacted in  their praise of Ms. Hill's biography.<br />   Other historical figures from  the 19th century have their biographers: Lincoln (who some may say has too  many) has D.H. Donald and C. Sandburg (who I consider to be the best),  Robert E. Lee has D.S. Freeman, U.S. Grant has McFeely, and Theodore  Roosevelt (better included in the 20th century, but including him here  helps me make my point) has Edmund Morris.  Joseph Smith is still without a  definitive biographer: perhaps because even the source material for writing  about him is unavailable or suspicious.  Never the less, I do not believe  that his book is as good as it is going to get about Joseph Smith.	2000-01-06

The author leaves the minutae of the civil war to the historians  dealing with that event: instead he focuses on the role Lincoln played in  helping to keep the union together.

He also does a good job of showing that good scandal management requires disclosure of the facts, and allowance of an outside  investigation (these are the &quot;two fundamental lessons of  watergate&quot;)  But, the book focuses too much on the President Clinton  scandals, only to conclude that they were of a totally different essence  than Watergate was.
