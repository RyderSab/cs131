Somewhat of a disappointment.  The book takes off in the beginning with a good storyline and a character I like, but later she behaves inconsistently with her character description, as do many others.  This left me constantly wondering who they were and what their purpose was.  The book ends neatly enough, but not without some effort on my part to reach the last page.	2001-08-02

From being abused by her mother, to being abandoned by a lover, to being used and eventually finding someone to love, Gabrielle shows us again and again the power of the human spirit.  This book was excellent and made me want to protect and take care of Gabriella as a child, but she makes it through some very difficult things and eventually grows in to a young woman in search of someone she can love and trust.  I think she found it in Peter.  This is a particularly difficult subject ot write about and I think DS did a great job.	2001-07-11

And I'm very open to new types of writing, especially from established authors. But Grisham should definitely stick to what he knows.  This story starts out slowly and drags on until the end.  It took me 2 weeks to finish and I keep hoping it'd get better.  The story of Luke on a cotton farm is interesting, as he develops a crush on Tally and is witness to all sorts of crimes and secrets, a lot of pressure on a little boy.  But the story wraps up with Luke leaving behind his grandparents and the cotton for a new life with his parents and a new baby on the way.  The story wraps up without bringing closure on many of the characters - what ever happens to Tally and the Cowboy, to Libby and the baby?  Does Ricky ever come home from the war and does he marry Libby?  Do Luke's grandparents survive the flood and the debt they are in?  What happens to the Letchers?  Does Hank's body ever surface?  Too many loose strings ... Definitely frustrating at the end, especially since I'd invested many hours and kept pushing to finish this book.  I should've stopped long before ...	2001-06-13

This story tells of the life of a New Orleans madam and how her youth shaped her whole life, from leaving a less-than-ideal family to set out on her own to build her own fortune and fame.  Always adhering to strict rules to provide the highest class of service to her clients, Norma is on a constant search for true love, often finding that she couldn't give up her work to stay home and be a traditional wife and mother.  In the end, Norma gets the guy, until her obsession with beauty and youth becomes more than even she can handle and her world slowly starts to fall apart.<br />The only criticism is that this book is less like a story and more a historical account of her life.

The storyline on the cover didn't appeal to me, bigotry and hate divided two families. Okay. The characters seem shallow and confused in their own lives and then pass that confusion on. Tom is a boy so dedicated to his younger brother Timmy and his girlfriend Robbie, but only bends to his mother's wishes out of sympathy and pity for her. His father is a domineering man who pushes Tom to follow in the beliefs of his dad while belittleing his mother. The Crawfields seem like good people and they seem like the most honest characters in the book.<br />Overall, not a book I'd recommend.	2001-05-07

This book is filled with strong characters and even stronger roots - to the past and to family.  This book kept me in my chair turning page after page, shocked and sometimes crying over the tragedies and desperation felt in the story but nonetheless hoping for the best and rejoicing in the love the characters felt for each other and the length to which they were willing to go to help a friend.<br />Have to admit I was nervous to read something based on a true story, but Baldacci pulled this one off in style.	2001-04-10

The book had too many coincidences (like how Dana kept getting interviews with all the people she needed at just the right time and how she spent zero time in the office and all her time out chasing down a theory on company time and expense).  Characters were introduced, described and then never seen nor heard from again.  And the intensity of this book just never reached a point where I felt really interested in what was going to happen in the end.  I didn't become attached to the characters and didn't feel like I knew enough about them to care.  An easy read, but not one that kept me up all night.	2001-03-27

The male lead in the Commander was a refreshing change.  The  storyline of UFOs was a little hokey in the beginning and it got worse as the book went on(-2 stars).  I enjoyed the suspense and thrill of the chase while the Commander tracked down each of the witnesses and then became the &quot;Hunted&quot; in the second book (+2 stars).  Definitely kept me interested and reading, but I hated the idea of the aliens and their spaceship.  Just not the type of thing Sheldon should be writing about.

Having both been hurt, they were drawn to each other and, I felt, &quot;meant to be together&quot;.  No relationship is easy, though, and distance, work and family kept them from spending as much time together as they'd like to have done.

The fact that they stumble on a politicial seeking office as the President of the United States is an added bonus and one they want to use to their benefit.

I, too, am a Judy Blume fan from years ago as a teenager and was excited to read Blume as an 'adult' writer. I was not disappointed. Though shocking at times, this story of the friendship that blossoms between unlikely friends - Caitlin and Victoria - drew me in and held me tight. I loved the honesty and frankness in Blume's writing, especially when talking about the growing and changing in these young women's bodies and minds. I'm sure these are things many young girls have thought about and experimented with, but no other author addresses them so openly. The story continues as these two young girls explore love and sex and relationships apart from each other, yet remaining best friends through it all.<br />The tragic ending was a surprise but I appreciated the reality of the book, rather than wrapping it up all neat and clean. Victoria deserved true happiness, after being loyal to her first friend for so long, and I'm glad she found it.	2001-02-05

Some characters I loved, some I detested and some I really never did make up my mind about. Each faced their own demons and had to make decisions - some good, some bad - on how to live their lives and get what they thought they deserved.  Kathy was fighting to keep the house her family had left her, when it was wrongfully taken from her.  The Behrani family was fighting to make a new life in a strange new country and to maintain the upper status they were used to.  Lester was trying to find happiness in a new relationship while maintaining the stability of a family at home.  All were strong characters determined to survive, which is the theme of this book that energized me.  Survival.  Each of these characters did what they could to survive the situation they were in.  Each of them was a fighter.  They didn't always do the &quot;right&quot; thing, they didn't always do the legal thing.  But they were fighters to the end.<br />True, this book isn't a happy one.  But I wouldn't call it depressing.  It's the story of how real people fight to survive in a world that isn't perfect.  It's very realistic and honest.	2001-02-05

I enjoyed this book on the level that it was an easy read and a touching story with good characters.  I sympathized with Jamie when she was the outcast and I'm glad Landon looks beyond what the public sees to learn about the woman deep within.  But this book is written on the level of a teenager and definitely doesn't have the depth of character and story that &quot;The Notebook&quot; has.

The brief storyline offered above piqued my interest but in no way prepared me for the depth of feelings and emotions I would experience when I met Charlotte and later, Justin.  Having lived through a harrowing experience in her rape, Charlotte makes a very difficult decision to give birth to and abandon her baby. Years later, alone and lonely, she makes her way to the house of Gentle Men to befriend Justin, a man trying to atone for his sins of the past. The theme of the book is atoning for one's sins and forgiveness - Charlotte must not only forgive the soldier who took away her innocence, but she must also forgive herself for abandoning her baby. Hepinstall cleverly contrasts sex without love to intimacy without sex and emphasizes that you need a balance to make the best relationship.  Through the house of Gentle Men, Charlotte and Justin aren't the only characters who seek and attain forgiveness - you'll have to read the book to learn more!<br />For a first book, this is an excellent start and I hope to find more by Hepinstall very soon! Highly recommended and I will pass it on to everyone I know.	2000-11-09

My second Alex Cross book and definitely not my last.  &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot; is a story of twinning murderers on oppostie coasts and their wacky and sometimes grotesque ways of toturing their victims.  This Patterson novel was riveting and thrilling, but I found the book a little difficult to follow in the beginning, I kept confusing the two murderers!  The other characters were good.  I really like Alex Cross and his neverending search for someone to love (all the whilst being afraid to lose them).  His family's just a little too perfect with the Nana Mama and two kids, but not a big issue.  The story line is one surprise after another and just when you think you're safe and sound - out comes the bad guys again.

I found the subject extremely interesting but I suppose starting a book knowing that the majority of the main characters will perish in the story  kind of discouraged me from reading. In addition, I kept losing track of  the different people because Krakauer would refer to the same person as  'Andy' in some places and 'Harris' in others. I almost needed a cheat sheet  to keep them all straight. Overall, I'm glad I read it and admire Krakauer,  Harris, Hall and Scott (and the rest of the team) for their bravery and  skill and I mourn for the way the trip ended, but I'm not sure this type of  book would get my time or attention again.

The topics were, at times, shocking, and don't really remind me of anyone I know and I  can't identify with many of the things she experienced, but this book  definitely hooked me.  Too bad the ending didn't give more away in the way  of Dolores' future.	2000-06-26

The last 20 or so pages were the best in the book, and I kept reading, hoping it would get better.  The hint of romance doesn't develop  until the end and I would have liked to have had more background in to  that.  Not a bad read, but some of her others are better.	2000-06-13

I couldn't put it down right from the start!  I fell in love with Maggie's story and I yearned to know the truth about her 3 dead past  lovers.  I cried with her every time and loved how the book was written  from the character's perspective in a trial.  The ending drew to a nice  finish and I still respected and liked Maggie through it all.  I'm hooked  on Patterson, but I think I liked his Alex Cross character better.	2000-05-04

Alex Cross is such a believable character and the paths he takes through this book are so exciting! The ending was not a complete surprise because I  could kinda see it coming, but Patterson's book definitely surprised me in  other ways!  I'm definitely going to look for other books by Patterson and  especially Alex Cross!	2000-04-28

This book is less blood and guts and more realistic horror, if there is such a thing!  I couldn't put this book down, though parts turned my stomach and gave me nightmares!  Bravo!	2000-04-17

I was sadly disappointed.  This book is about a bad relationship between a mother and daughter.  The ending is nice, but too drastic to be realistic, given  the bad feelings that seem to harbour for so long in both parties.  I  wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.	2000-04-17

I opened this book dreading a historical account of a geisha's life.  I turned page after page to learn about a geisha's life, trials and family.  This book was so true-to-life that I laughed, cried and hurt along with  Sayuri.  Definitely recommended to everyone!	2000-04-17

What a wonderful book of the friendship between 4 different women, each facing their own battles of                      love, marriage and family. The ending was especially wonderful and I, too, felt like I'd lost my best  friends when the book ended. The only criticism I have is that it was  difficult to follow the characters when the chapters kept switching from  one view to the next. I kept going back to the inside cover of the book to  refresh my memory as to who each woman was. But overall, highly  recommended!	2000-03-06

What I got was a list of 500 obvious ideas that any idiot could have thought up, given the time. 'Put addresses  in your address book in                      pencil so you can update  easily.' Duh! These ideas are too basic and really didn't help me at all.  And if I had time to implement the 500 ideas in this book, then I wouldn't  need the book at all! A big disappointment.	2000-01-17

Emily and Michael became good friends instead of characters and I laughed and cried with them.  This book also  caused me to think about the issues in my own heterosexual marriage and to  confront some of the things that have been missing.	1999-11-22

My husband and I just returned from Paris and, fortunately, our friend had this book to loan us while there.  We don't usually buy travel books when traveling, as we like to explore on our own, but this book was a God-send.   We carried it with us everywhere and used it each night to plan the next    day.  It had all the useful information, such as phone numbers, hours of  operation, addresses, the only thing it lacked was approximate prices for  the attractions.  We would have liked to have seen these, because prices  often determined our choices of visits.  However, this book was excellent  at helping us decide what areas were most interesting  to us, tell us a  little about the attraction or monument and give us some history at the  same time!  Highly recommended!	1999-02-09
