Jo Goodman's \\"A Season to Be Sinful\\" reminds me.<br /><br />A great historical romance will have highly developed main characters and only slightly less developed secondary characters, which \\"A Season to Be Sinful has\\". In this book, not only do I care about the hero, Sherry and the heroine, Rose, but I also care about their three wards and Sherry's godmother.  The plot is complex enough to show us who the hero and heroine are the shadows and the light. And why they are that way.<br /><br />It is a bit darker than one would expect in your typical romance, I don't think I'm giving away too much that you can't ascertain in the first chapter, but the heroine is forced into sexual bondage. So, if that is just a place you don't want to go, I'd recommend not picking up the book.	2005-08-27

Have a difficult time getting into and finishing it but<br /><br />  end up enjoying the story anyhow<br /><br />4.)

I loved the plot, but the execution was off, and I can't put my finger on exactly why.<br /><br />This is definitely worth buying though and I look forward to following the evolution of the Kerrelyn Sparks, but this book isn't a keeper.<br /><br />I decided to review it because all of the reviews were 5 star -- and I feel that is misleading. It's a good book with a rehashed but interesting idea, but it isn't a five star book.	2005-08-21

But as a romance it was a bit weak.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Liz Maverick has created an alternate reality where Vampires, Werewolves, Humans, and maybe even Demons exist together. (I hope to find out more about the Demons in Cyd's story.) There's a hint of a watered down cyber punk feel to the book and the world Maverick created is interesting enough that I can't wait to read what the other authors in the series do with it.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />As a Romance the hero and heroine were a bit thin for my taste. I liked what I knew about them, but they were not fleshed out and actions they took in the story line didn't have the consequences that we were primed to expect. (I'd be more specific but don't want to give away a plot point.) I know that because it is a romance, things need to end happily ever after, that's one of the main reasons I read romances, but Maverick could have altered the story line a bit to make the conclusion more believable. Honestly, I found myself more interested in Marius' story than I was in the hero, Dain's, story.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Maverick set up interesting characters for future books in the series that I hope to meet again and it is a great sci-fi/fantasy, but not necessarily a great romance with sci-fi/fantasy elements.	2005-07-17

The biggest problem I have is that I have been stuck in the little locked book/calendar frame of mind with my journal. Tristine Rainer gives her readers some really great tools to break out of that thought pattern. Before reading this I didn't fully realize that I was in this pattern of self-editing/self-consciousness with pretty much all of my journal writing. It really held me back. Instead of not having enough to say, not thinking that my life is interesting enough to track on a regular basis, I now feel freed to explore my inner life. The combination of encouragement and practical tools to do this make it an invaluable book for the journaler.  <br /> <br />My only complaint is that the language is dated and I would like to see it updated. It took me out of the moment book too often. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-06-14

(Come on, who doesn't like to fantasize about how the fantastically wealthy live, not matter the era.) I'm not going to write a re-cap of the story. It's been done, and done well. But I am going to say, if you as a romance reader have been disappointed with what has been published lately, as I have been -- this won't disappoint. While I enjoy all of the great fantasy romances that have been published over the last couple of years historical romances have been particularly dismal, even from my favorite author's (and not Suzanne Enoch:), as have contemporaries, so much so that I've been having an a hard time feeding my romance novel habit.<br /><br />If there are any editors or publishers trolling Amazon, and I'm in marketing so I know you do, kick up your publishing efforts, bring in some better editors, please. This is a growth market, I worked at a bookstore for about 3 years, romance readers will buy 3,4,8 books at a time if they are interesting and well written, and most of the regulars are like me - they buy weekly if there is stuff to buy. If I can find enough books to read, I'll read anywhere from 4 to 7 books a week. So please spend more time on grooming new authors and editing your cash cows. I haven't enjoyed such a romance that wasn't either romantica or fantasy romance, in months.	2005-04-18

But this is bad. When her first novel came out I wrote that her first book was the best that I had read in years and that I couldn't wait to read the following books. But now, I wish she'd take a long break. Oh, and get an editor, no one is too big a name for an editor.<br /><br />The character development stinks. The expository information is lifted from other books. Also, I love me some alpha males and understand that Carpathinian males are all about the mating ritual, but he raped her. Then the author had the gall to let us know that the heroine (I just read the book last night and can't remember their names - that is the definition of a bad book.) liked it despite the fact that it was sort of painful - and oh, she didn't consent.<br /><br />What editor thought that a rapist as hero was a great trend to bring back? Hello, we're not in the 70/80s anymore - give us heroines who remind women of how we are now. We don't need an excuse to enjoy sex and we don't want heroines who are doormats. And giving them the job of a rancher who takes care of everything doesn't make her less of a doormat if she falls in love with her rapist.	2005-02-10

The series was great because it was an awesome mix of detective novels with a fantasy background and some romance thrown in. Now it's all about the sex and not even emotional or interesting sex. I suppose LKH thinks she's making it interesting with the multiple partners and with the descriptions of what it takes to give a good bj, but that's not what makes a good sex scene -- that barely makes good porn.<br /><br />I don't care about Anita anymore. I don't care if she lives or dies or who she ends up with, or about her job (which she doesn't seem to much care about anymore either.)<br /><br />Don't bother to read this, if you want some good and honest erotica with a fantasy edge read an Ellora's Cave book.	2004-10-13

But that's not the reason to read it.<br /><br /> The way Armstrong incorporates Elliot's Ash-Wednesday in her life story is mesmerizing, but that's not a reason to read it.<br /><br /> The way she opens herself up and allows us into her inner world is devastating. But that's not the reason to read it.<br /><br /> It's that she does all of that and more with carefully crafted prose and an amazing amount of honesty that makes this more than a worth while way to spend a day.<br /><br /> Also, I found the passage she included toward the end of the book, from Ibn Al-Arabi, that begins &quot;Do not attach yourself to any particular creed exclusively, so you may disbelieve all the rest; otherwise you will lose much good, nay you will fail to recognize the real truth of the matter. God, the omnipresent and omnipotent, is not confined to any one creed ...\\" not only meaningful for this time and this place, but also personally meaningful as it sums up my personal beliefs better than I have ever been able to.	2004-08-01

What separates porn from erotica is that with erotica there is character development and plot, and while most erotic novels out there don?t descend to the level of Forum, they don?t give us real people who have emotional connections when being sexually adventurous. I really liked Kate, Joe, and Sean as a couple and understood why they would want to be together, beyond the obvious.

I know I don't like Jayne's Stephanie James novels, but I can't help myself from buying them when they come out. They are her earliest books and it's fun to read them to see how she has evolved as a writer, how her characters -- (she uses essentially the same sort of outline for her characters no matter what name she's writing under: Book smart woman or New Agey woman who thinks she has it all together and can go it alone until she is confronted by the Alpha self-made male who exudes a quite and deadly power enters her life) have evolved to fit both the decade she's writing in: 80's, 90's or 00's, and the romance genre she's writing for. It's interesting. And not her fault (I  hope) that Harlequin is reissuing these books.<br />Cuz they are bad. Involuntarily close your eyes and do a mental 'la la la la' so you don't have to read them clich&eacute;d, formulaic-writing, bad.

This can make for fun but confusing stories (at the end of the book Merry has 16 guard/studs in her entourage and its not easy keeping them all straight) that rely less on plot and more on character.<br />Merry is in a race to get pregnant before her cousin in order to claim the Unseelie crown and bring fertility back to the Fey, and shes not having an easy time of it.

So often authors will suck you in with great concepts in the first book of a trilogy and then fail to deliver in the 2nd and 3rd books. (Most notably for Ms. Roberts is her Three Sisters Trilogy). But this second book rocks! It keeps up the energy of the first and even though it is a love story and we know how it's going to end -- she keeps up a level of suspense in the story itself.

It's not that she neccisarily hates being a werewolf, it's just that after having such a messed up childhood, she can't stand having her choice taken from her without her consent.<br />It's a story about love, sex, murder, and becoming comfortable with self.	2003-06-06

After winning a country estate at a card game, Lord Ferdinand Dudley sets out to take claim but finds it occupied instead by a beautiful unmarried woman, Miss Viola Thornhill, who claims that he could not have won it from the Earl since the previous Earl had deeded it to her out of love. Ferdinand does not believe her and they are at a stalemate.<br />If your looking for your average Regency Hero and your average Regency Heroine \\"No Man's Mistress\\" is not for you. However, if you want to read a story about how two loving but damaged people can make their way to one another and make each other whole, this is wonderful book.	2003-04-15

While the plot itself is not the most original plot ever, romance readers don't really read for plot, we read for character development. And Balogh delivers some great characters.<br />Eve and Aidan are two people from radically different backgrounds. Aidan is the younger brother of a Duke and Eve is the only daughter of a Coal Miner made good, fit together like the final to pieces to a puzzle.<br />The multi-book - family saga deal is really popular at the moment with mixed results. I have found that often the books are repetitive because the characters seem to be carbon copies of each other. Balogh doesn't have that problem. I can't wait to see what happens next.	2003-04-06

Of course, there are some books in the series that I like better than other's, but I am never disappointed. How often can someone say that and mean it?<br />That being said, \\"Cerulean Sins\\" is one of my favorite books in the series. Anita is really growing as a person and into her powers. Her relationships just keep getting more intimate, erotic, and enjoyable to read. What I liked most about Cerulean Sins is that Anita seems to be (at last) coming to terms with whom and what she is -- and appreciating the people in her life for who and what they are as well.<br />While this is a stand alone book, this is a series that is worth reading in its entirety and in order. I would recommend going out and buying all of the books in the series and devouring them like a box of chocolates, if you have not any of the other Anita Blake novels.	2003-04-02

I liked this one the best. The explanations are not simple, but they do not expect you to be a grammarian either. Actually, I only came across this by accident. I found it in a book bin (for free!)  and picked it up, --since I am a sucker for anything free - especially a good book, and it has made writing much easier for me.<br />Boy, am I glad I did. The St. Martin's Handbook actually teaches grammar in a comprehensive way, and they focus on the grammar issues that I have problems with - and for good reason. Andrea Lunsford and Robert Connors found out what the patterns were for error on student writing, and they gathered a nationwide sample of over 20,000 student essays's to find out what the error patterns for error among students are, and they wrote a book for geared towards those patterns.<br />This book isn't just for the grammatically challenged though; it is a good reference, with everything one hopes to find in a handbook and an excellent learning tool as well. Skip over Bedford and head straight for St. Martin's.	2002-12-26

The problem is that his mother was their father's second wife and she was a servant before they married. Carlisle doesn't want to marry a Pampered Princess of the Ton, but he also does not want to marry someone who is not of the same class as he, because his mom was treated poorly by society.<br />To get away from his matchmaking sister, Carlisle takes an 'urgent business trip' and while is set upon by paid killers. Dr. Edger Pickering and his daughter Melanie, who are hiding in the country, save the Duke's life and care for him while he recovers and during his recovery he discovers that Melanie and her son need his help.<br />This is the first book that I have read by Susan Grace and as much as I enjoyed the plotting the writing was distracting. I'm not sure how exactly to describe it - it's not that the prose is horrible, it's just that it was written at like a sixth grade reading level.  The plot is fresh the characters are likeable, but the writing is distracting in its simplicity and the characters hold views and conversations that don't fit into the era that it is written in.	2002-12-11

When she first came out with these I think that she was one of the very few romance authors doing fantasy/sci-fi/futuristics of that type so she was definitely breaking new ground. The problem is she used the old bodice ripper model to do it and her males are a bit more alpha than the 21st century reader is used to. These two books are more in her Stephanie James style of writing than her Crystal, Quick or Krentz style of writing. So brace yourself. The heroes are of the &quot;Me Tarzan you Jane --and you mine&quot; and the heroines are of the &quot;No. I mean yes. I mean no. I mean yessss .... (insert moan)&quot; type.

It is an emotional read and my favorite of the anthology. I must admit however that Lynn Kurland is one of my favorite genre writers.<br />\\"An Interrupted Tapestry\\" by Madeline Hunter is a story about two people who belong together, who seem to always be in different places in their lives when opportunity arises. I think that this was a weaker story than the others, only because I think that it deserved a full length book.<br />Karen Marie Moning creates a fantastic world in \\"Dragonswan\\" where dragons and men are one and they have only one chance to find love. This was a richly detailed story with a great fantasy background and I would love to return to the world in a full length novel.<br />Sherrilyn Kenyon takes us \\"Into the Dreaming\\" where the fey play games with human lives and only love can save the day.<br />All right all of these descriptions are highly subjective, but the stories are so short I don't want to give anything away.

What I have really love about this series is that it's rich cast of supporting characters, and how the heroine, Lt. Eve Dallas seems to emotionally grow in each book.<br />There was no growth this time, just a lot of recylcing of catch Dallas phrases.<br />Actually I felt as if she wrote it on a template. There were the usual Dallas ... moments, Dallas can't accept the softer feelings, Dallas fly's off the handle when confronted by conflict, etc...,  but very little real interaction between she and her friends / collegues. We are TOLD (and not shown) so often that Eve Dallas feels certain these ways, with the same stock expressions, that the book it reads more like a write by the numbers than a book put out by the ever prolific, but usually engaging. Nora Roberts. Also, since this case was so focused on people who prey on children I would have expected a bit more actualization in regards to her scarred childhood.<br />I gave it 3 stars because the plot is engaging - and if anyone else but Nora Roberts had written it I would have given it 4, but this feels phoned in. The plot is interesting as usual but she fails to create a connection with between reader and charecter.	2002-08-27

The only major problem that I had with the book was that Chapter 23 and Chapter 24 speak of the first `homecoming' of Dionysis to Olympis twice and in conflicting matters.

Colin has spent his life adored by everyone, but restless as only a third son can be in Ton life. They are the perfect match for each other -- it just takes Colin a while to figure that out and Penelope a while to believe enough in herself to see it.<br />This was such a fun romance, with two likeable characters who had chemistry between them. In so many romances it is difficult to see why the heroine would ever want to be with the hero or vice versa. One is usually an insensitive brooding clod and the other an idiot who spouts of platitudes about women's rights, but loves it when her man treats her mean.<br />Julia's characters are not maniacal idiots, and it is always a joy to read her books.	2002-07-10

Tracy Collins, a down to earth movie star, goes to England to film a movie that is set amongst the splendor of the Regency era. Since this is her first foray into a drama or a period piece it is an important movie for her and she wants to do her best. The problem is she keeps seeing ghosts - who look remarkably like herself and the present lord of the manor, Harry Oliver -- on the his ancestral estate, Silverbridge, which they are filming on.<br />Tracy is having trouble getting over a tragedy in her past and Harry is wary of being associated with an American actress after a bad episode with a Model who overdosed and implicated him in her death. Karma is in overdrive though and these two are destined to be together.<br />It was a fast read with a few unusual twists and was a pleasure to read.<br />When a favorite author jumps into new sub-genre, like Joan Wolf has in Silverbridge, I am always a bit leery. I want to support the author, but the likelihood of the book being even close to the caliber of her regular sub-genre is low at best, since it usually takes an author two to three books to get the hang of the new style of writing - if that ever happens at all. I am happy to say that this is not the case with Joan Wolf's new novel Silverbridge and I highly recommend it.	2002-04-27

I love Ms. Hamilton's writing, her Anita Blake stories are great, but I must say I, (and I think the author) are getting a bit bored with her. So, I am thrilled to see a second book in a new series featuring Princess Meredith.<br />\\"A Caress of Twilight\\" shows Hamilton at her creative best. It is the ultimate in female fantasy. Princess Meredith, a half human fairy princess, must conceive a child before her cousin does to gain the fairy throne and keep her crazy cousin, who wants to kill her, from becoming King. To do that, she must sleep with all her guards, as often as possible, until she becomes pregnant. Cool huh?<br />There is a mass murder mystery to solve, a curse to overcome, and enough royal intrigue to rival even the House of Windsor. I can't recommend this book enough, it is a fun -- gobble it up in one sitting read - and I eagerly await the next installment.	2002-03-29

There just are not enough good romantic fantasies to choose from in the marketplace and I think that Owens should be able to grab herself a great place in this open sub-genre of romance.

The main characters are a great match and Feehan introduces several secondary characters and the suggestion of one º that leaves me anxious for the next two books in the series.<br />After her last book, &quot;Dark Fire&quot; which I thought was a bit predictable and poorly written compared to previous books in her series, I was worried that she was writing this series too fast, and had lost the magic of the series. It was just a small blip though and &quot;Dark Legend&quot; is everything that I could have hoped for from Feehan, dark, sexy and mysterious. I'm back to anxiously waiting for the next installment in this fun series.	2002-01-04

I bought the paperback when it was released in September and couldn't get past the first chapter. But I have been ill the last couple of days and really had a chance to sit down and read it last night and it is very enjoyable, albeit completely different from anything that I would expect from Julie Garwood, since it is a contemporary thriller.<br />Once I got over the fact that I was reading a Julie Garwood book, and chucked those expectations outside I really enjoyed the plot and Laurant and Nick were an appealing couple. My one real gripe about the book is that she named 3 important characters in the book four letter N names which were just unnecessarily confusing at first.<br />The secondary characters were all very engaging and I think that this first book was a set-up for a long running series of thrillers based on the group of special agents that Nick belongs to.<br />Overall it was a great book and I look forward to picking up Mercy - the next book in the series once it is released in paperback.	2001-12-31

While the two stories don't seem to have much in common they each feature an unconventional love story, which explores the nature of love.<br />They were both great stories, and once started, I couldn't put them down.

The book, and my instructor, has helped me understand the difference between an autobiography and a memoir or a personal familiar essay and a personal critical essay.<br />All of that being said, I found this book to be more of an introduction into the world of Creative Nonfiction than an instructional 'how to' book.

Their characters are compelling and likeable. I care about the characters they created for these short stories because they were likeable in themselves and because they continued some family sagas from previous books.<br />There are four novellas \\"Just Curious\\" and \\"Miracles\\" by Judith McNaught and \\"Miracles\\" and \\"Change of Heart\\" by Jude Deveraux each story has been previously published and even though I read them when they first came out they were still fun to read again.<br />Actually I enjoyed these older stories far more than I have enjoyed anything that the two have put out in recent years. I wish that they would move away from the suspense or thriller type of stories that they have been writing the last several years and go back to what they did before. I haven't found recent stories of theirs as character based as they used to be now they seem to be more plot rather than person driven now. It used to be that they could make my stomach drop in empathy with a character now I can barely finish their books.<br />Anyhow this is a great collection and worth buying.	2001-11-27

All of the stories are interesting and well written. Part of what makes this anthology so good I think is that each of the authors gets the pacing right for the story. So often the pacing is off and the story suffers for it, but not here!<br />JD Robb (Nora Roberts) in, 'Interlude to Death', has Eve Dallas at an off world police convention in a fabulous hotel owned by the yummy Roark where of course murder and mayhem and murder occur. Short though the story is we learn an interesting fact about a possible, earlier - dark connection between, Roark and Eve's fathers'. While not Robbs best work to date it is still a welcome installment in to the IN DEATH series.<br />Susan Krinard is the only author in this collection who doesn't write a new chapter for an existing series, but creates an entirely new world. Because it is new however there more space given to explanation rather than story telling which somewhat weakens the story. In, 'Kinsman', a damaged telepath and a princess in disguise band together to halt a conspiracy that has universe wide implications that could create war. In the end it is literally their love that saves the day. I hope that this was just an introduction to a new world and that she writes a full book for it, perhaps for the missing - and found Prince.<br />Maggie Shayne's 'Immortality' gives us a more sympathetic view of Puabi, the Immortal High Dark Witch who spent centuries taking the hearts of good witches and torturing her husband for loving another woman. She is found barely alive in the ocean after her final confrontation with her husband and his lover and she at last finds the missing piece of her soul romantically and literally.<br />'Magic Like Heat Across my Skin' by Laurell K.

Girl with 'superpowers' falls for and has problems deciding between a vampire and shape shifter and or werewolf.<br />That being said, Charlaine Harris tells a fantastic a fun story with interesting characters and with a premise that I'd like to follow into an indefinite amount of sequels. The mystery is engaging, and any book that has the main character named Sookie is just too much fun.<br />Sookie reads peoples thoughts whether she wants to or not. Everyone thinks she's crazy because she spends so much time trying not to read other people's thoughts that it makes her dingy. So, she never has boyfriends, because really, who wants to be able to read their lover's mind in the middle of an intimate moment? Then Sookie's dream man, the one-man whose mind she can't read walks into her bar. The fact that he's a Vampire just makes dating a bit more complicated. Oh, and the fact that a killer is on the loose biting women's inner thighs and then strangling them to death, and her Vampire boyfriend Bill and her brother (who likes kinky sex) are at the top of the list of suspects.<br />Harris is definitely a new author worth watching and if you like your horror mixed with romance / laughter and a kick ... heroine then \\"Dead Until Dark\\" is the book for you.	2001-06-22

It is a special kind of biography that chronicles the life of Evelyn Ryan an extraordinarily resourceful woman who was born ahead of her time.<br />Evelyn Ryan, raised her ten children with grace and style, using her wit and ability to see the humor in a life that would have most people begging for relief to win prizes large and small. It is an unflinching look at a large family that depended on an alcoholic and abusive breadwinner who was more likely to drink his wages rather than pay his mortgage.<br />\\"The Prize Winner of Defiance Ohio\\" is a fantastic chronicle of an America that no longer exists and in some ways never existed. It shatters the myth of the middle class 50's housewife who stayed at home and took care of the children without `worrying her little head' about the finances. In this America contests were won by skill rather than luck and Evelyn managed to keep her family going with prizes such as that ranged from bicycles to two-week trips to Switzerland (converted to cash) to TVs and juke boxes. Ryan had the touch.<br />This book has made me laugh and cry and think about my family. My grandmother was in an abusive marriage, with an alcoholic husband and seven children, at around the same time that Evelyn was at a time when the law and the community blamed a woman for an abusive husband. What a life.<br />What a great story. Buy this book and celebrate the life of Evelyn Ryan, or E.L.

After living for years in the shadow of her beautiful sister she has gone off to make it on her own. Only she hasn't learned how to value herself yet.<br />Duke is an emotionally scarred Security officer who because he was orphaned as a child and his wife died is afraid to love. Cami, however, --- of course --- makes it impossible for him not to let love enter his heart and it scares the stuff out of him.<br />There were only two problems with this book, even though it was a Desire and had sex in it the sensuality level read more like a regular Silhouette and 1/6 of the pages were printed EXTREMELY light.<br />The print is so in those areas that if I had any sight problems at all I wouldn't be able to read it.

Her story and the tribes story is told through the eyes of two people, Nanapush an elder who is sympathetic to Fleur and the Native American lifestyle and through Pauline a woman twisted with a sort of love/hate obsession with Fleur and a repulsion of her own heritage.<br />Nanapush tells the story to his `granddaughter' Lilly, Fleur's child. He does this to explain her incomprehensible mother who seems to have abandoned her for no reason as well as a way to explain the politics of the tribe. He wants to save Lily from what he sees as an unsuitable marriage and reunite her with her mother and fully with her Native American heritage.<br />Pauline, narrates to who knows what or who or for what purpose. Her madness is captivating and is a manifestation of the sickness, literally and figuratively, that the alien (white) culture brings to the Native American people.<br />At the same time this is a story about women. Fleur, is an incomprehensible woman who breaks the rules of what it is to be an Indian woman and is feared and respected as a consequence of her actions. Her beauty and fierceness make her a force of nature. Pauline is a woman who is treated without worth as a woman. It is this, and her soul sickening envy, I believe, that drives her madness. Margaret, Lily's grandmother represents the traditional strong Native American woman I believe, and while her methods for survival are of the Mac tuck variety she ends up surviving and living the best of all three of the woman.<br />The book covers 12 years and is a lyrical look at a culture's struggle to survive.	2001-02-16

After enduring a difficult marriage and helping out at a women's 'library' Gwyn knows just how precarious a woman's position can be and when she accidentally gets caught up in someone else's domestic drama, ... without even knowing it!, her life is in danger.<br />Eight years before Gwyn had been in love with Jason Radley and Jason had been in love with Gwyn family pressure failure to communicate and circumstance forced Gwyn to elope with another man. Now, a mysterious legacy has been left to Gwyn and her seven-year-old son, with two stipulations, 1. Jason is to be Gwyns' son's Guardian and 2. Gwyn can only live on the interest, the principle (10,000 pounds) goes to her son when she dies.<br />This is not a simple plot, as usual for an Elizabeth Thornton novel, but all of the threads add rather then subtract from the main story line.

There never seems to be a moment in her novels where she thinks 'perhaps this is a bit over-the-top and maybe I should drop the scene or line' or whatever. While her writing style may not make her the next literary genius of our time it can make for fun reading. The absence of shame in an erotic novel in particular is a plus.<br />In the Beauty Chronicles Rice revisits the Sleeping Beauty legend and openly claims the sexuality of the old fairy tale but also surpasses the sexuality. In the Sleeping Beauty series Rice takes Beauty through a sexual journey of domination, degradation and complete sexual abandonment.<br />This series is not for the timid and needs to be read in the same way that one reads her Vampire Chronicles but is still a fun addition to any erotic library. If nothing else Rice with her Beauty series has helped to bring erotica further into the main stream of American homes.	2001-02-04

With each interviewee having a different take on just what taboo is. It is about sexual desires, acts and fantasies that people keep secret from their partners. They put stories in this book that seemed to follow regular themes.  There is a wide range of personality types and their corresponding kinks represented in this book. They range from Mary, who was brought up in a Convent after her parents died, and has some pretty tame ideas about what is taboo in her story titled \\"Shameful Desire\\", to Olga who likes to exhibit herself graphically in front of a web cam.  This was a thoughtfully written, sexy, well-put together book. The stories in it not only titillate but they also educate by presenting a wide range of sexual fantasies and realities from normal people.

This is the best new beginning of a historical series romance that I have ever read. The book itself reads like old fashioned chapter novels and has left me on the edge of my seat waiting for the next installment in this fantastic, yet disturbing book. I say that it is disturbing because it has its characters be human, with the same kind of human foibles that we all have. In \\"Deadly Love\\" however, Joyce somehow allows her characters to be heroic and larger then life, despite their humanity, in the way that we want our romance novel characters to be.<br />Francesca is a woman ahead of her time who wants to both be her own woman (she is attending the first women's college in England) and she wants to keep her family happy so she keeps her endeavor from her mother. Even though it means attending balls to the wee hours of the morning, attending classes a scant few hours after falling asleep, and studying every spare moment.<br />Of course, it would not be a romance without the flawed hero, a.k.a. Rick Bragg, the head of the police, Francesca's love interest, and her almost nemesis. He is sexy, brooding and mad bad and `dangerous to know.\\"<br />At the end of the book there are serious personal problems in the love lives of both her brother and her sister, a new mystery for the amateur sleuth, Francesca to solve and budding love for Rick and our heroine. This is both a great ending and a fantastic beginning of a new book and a new series for Brenda Joyce.	2000-12-31

It tells the story of two wounded people who are able to almost miraculously find and heal each other. It's a moving, beautiful story about three people, however, (yes I said three) trapped by circumstance into an almost unbearable situation.<br />The only problem with this book is its construction, the first half of the book could easily stand on its own with only a few minor alterations in plot device, and the second half of the book is slow moving but still moving. :)<br />I bought the book before I read a review of it and I probably would not have bought it book if I had read the review first. The review basically said that the first half of the book was great and the second half was not so great. While I agree with that statement after reading it I can say that despite the problems with construction its a good read and Barbara Samuel is an author worth watching. She has fresh ideas, a poetic turn of phrase and is a lot of fun to read. She just needs a little more time to settle into her stride I think.	2000-12-21

I usually judge these anthologies by a different criteria then I do a regular book because they usually just do not measure up to a full length novel. This one I can say actually does measure up.  I think that it is because it has three novellas instead of the usual five, and that this has allowed the authors to fully develop their characters in a way that most anthologies do not allow. Each of the novellas would be worth buying individually. There was only one problem I had with the book, the first two stories were historical romances and the final story was a contemporary. While it was a great story it did not fit with the other two in the anthology.	2000-12-07

Anthony Bridgerton had a magical, loving childhood surrounded by love and doting parents. His parents were fantastically in love and he had a shining example of that love held before him during his childhood. Which is what screwed him up. You see, Anthony's' father died at 38 years old, from a bee sting when Anthony was just 18 years old. Since he held his father in such high esteem he could never conceive of outdistancing his father as a man in any way and he is convinced that he will die by the age of 38, if not before. So, he has spent his years since then, not only taking care of his family - he has seven other siblings and a mother to take care of - but he has been living life to the hilt as the ultimate Rake.<br />Enter Kate Sheffield, she is the oldest sister of the `Diamond' of the season Edwina and the Anthony's chosen wife. Only, Edwina has decided that Anthony is too big of a Rake to make a good husband for her sister and is doing everything she can to stop his marriage. While Anthony is doing everything he can to not fall in love with Kate. He has decided that he could not bear to die young if he had to leave a loved one behind.<br />This really is a great book and I highly recommend it. It shows that an author can create a attractive, intelligent hero without making him a complete jerk or from a dysfunctional family where the word love was a byword for stupidity. She has also created an intelligent, loving woman who is nor a wimp and who shares the same interests as the hero. Julia Quinn reminds me of Amanda Quick only better.	2000-12-02

It was told in the best Deveraux tradition, with love and laughter.<br />Jill Barnetts' story \\"Fall From Grace\\" about a highland lass and her captive `chieftain' was a revamped re-release and was the weak link in this compilation as far as I am concerned. It was however, a decent story just not as good as the others in the book.<br />\\"Cold Feet\\" by Geralyn Dawson has a Texan escort an estranged noblewoman back to Scotland and while there they fall for a mesmerizing hereditary witch. This was a great story with a great hero and heroine but there was a back-story about the noblewoman who the Texan took home that was not told. Very annoying, but a good story overall.<br />In Pam Binders' \\"Matchmaker\\" A matchmaker throws a Scottish tea shop owner and her handsome American software mogul back in time to Queen Mary's Court.

Michel/Michael is a male prostitute who has  been without a patroness for five years, since a fire that disfigured him.  Anne, is a 36 year old spinster who has spent her entire life subjugating  her own desires in order to care for her aged parents. After her parents  die, leaving Anne a huge inheritance, she decides that she wants to  experience passion, so she hires Michel to be her lover for the price of  10,000 pounds, for thirty days. She had seen him at a ball at her  disastrous come out and had wanted him ever since.<br />What I really enjoyed  about this story was that it actually had an interesting story line that  fit in/explains Michel/Michael's overt sexuality. The story itself is not  necessarily easy to follow, Schone actually assumes that her readers have a  bit of intelligence so the plot line is not obvious from the very  beginning. For instance we know from the very beginning that Michel is  seeking revenge for some heinous crime that was committed upon him as a  child. We also know that something happened to him as an adult but it is  not until almost the very end of the book that what happened is revealed.  It is then that the reason and logic behind Michel/Michael's actions and  cryptic remarks make sense.  This was a sensitive, beautiful, erotic story  - with a compelling plot, adventurous sex and compelling main characters.  If think that you would like to read historical erotic romances but have  been turned off by Susan Johnson's all sex, no plot, throw away character  stories then check out this and The Lady's Tutor.

She is also one of the most unrelentingly cheerful people ever created.

Only her nightmares are manifesting themselves physically and she is  losing time and waking up bloody.<br />It really is quite a good book, it  meanders a bit in a couple of places which may be off putting to some but  well worth the read.

I have an entire shelf of how to write books, and nothing I have has come close to the clarity and simplicity they bring together in their book on literary  archetypes.<br />The book is set up in four different main sections with each  of the sections actually delivering and surpasing what is promised.<br />Section I Hero Archetypes<br />Section II Heroine Archetypes<br />Section III  Using the Archetypes to Create Characters<br />Section IV Archetype  Interactions<br />Each of these sections gives not only easy to read  `straight' explanations of each of the archetypes but it also references  them to familiar movie and literary characters in a way that really  solidified the different archetypes in my mind.<br />This is the best book on  character development that I have ever read. It's layout is so easy to read  and use and its explanations are so clear and concise that when I brought  it to work to show a co-worker she went on-line and ordered one for herself  and her daughter. Reading it has brought to mind so many ideas that I am  not sure where to start first.	2000-07-24

He is saved from being put into jail by Maggie McBride, a psychologist and  the single mother of twin girls. Of course he is then admitted into the  loce mental hospital and doctor and patient end up becoming very  close.<br />Generally I am not a fan of time travel books, but Ms. Hill  creates such a fun world that I cn not help but enjoy her work.

It is about Beatrice Von Furstenburg, a woman ahead of her time who is a suffragette, and the president of a huge  corporation. She married a much older man at a young age. Even though he  was dismissive of her at first as a person he did not bother her much  sexually and taught her everything he knew about business. He was never  cruel and when he died he made her president of his corporation during at a  time when most women could not even deposit money in a bank without a man's  co-signature. Despite all of this she is terrible bitter about men and  marriage. Until of course she meets her sweet talking man, attorney and  aspiring politician, Connor Barrow.<br />Beatrice is also the guardian of her  sixteen-year-old love struck niece who thinks that she is violently in love  with an eighteen-year-old ne'er do well Jeffery Granton who is a cousin of  Conner's. When an abduction and rescue attempt goes terribly wrong and  Beatrice ends up in a brothel Conner is brought in to smooth things over,  and the basic story itself progresses nicely if rather chaotically from  there.<br />Problem Number #1<br />First and most importantly the two main  characters have no chemistry, at least not the chemistry that lovers should  have. Although they do had great friend chemistry. I found their  relationship so boring that I skimmed or skipped all of their lovemaking  scenes. It was not believable to me that they would be intimate in that  way.<br />Problem #2<br />I can understand Ms. Krahn's infatuation with the  early suffragette movement and with the plight of women during the early  part of last century.  I am a bit of an amateur scholar on the subject  myself, but she tried to cram too much history in the book and it took away  from the character development.  Also, she was awfully dismissive and  unkind in her treatment of the other suffragettes in book. She had them  look pretty silly on a regular basis.<br />Problem #3<br />She left too many  loose ends in the book and the end had a rushed quality to it. For  instance, what happened to her niece's father?  I understand from a  reference that was made that he was not dead, so why was he not around? And  since she ended it with present day people finding information on Connor  and Beatrice instead of an epilogue why did she not open the book with them  as well? It was unsymmetrical.<br />It was not a terrible book. I finished it.  But it lacked Ms. Krahn's usual magic.<br />The art work on the cover and the  inside jacket was fantastic though.look pretty silly on a regular basis.<br />Problem #3<br />She left too many  loose ends in the book and the end had a rushed quality to it.

I fell in absolute love with the hero, Gabriel Fitzgerald, a Wall Street tycoon  who has had extreme insomnia for 20 years. In the middle of a particularly  bad episode where Gabe did not sleep for over 40 hours his business partner  convinced him to go to a sleep clinic to get help. That is where he meets  Shana Gertz, a sleep-disorder doctor and a woman with sleep problems of her  own.<br /> I could tell you more about the story but it is really presented in  such a way that the revelations after these basic facts are told are  perfectly timed and I do not want to ruin the story for anyone. I can say  that if you like your heroes tortured, sexy, powerful and thoughtful and  your heroines likeable and capable this is a great book to read. There is  however a secondary story line that is a suspense that is not quiet as  successful, as it is a bit graphic and seems to have been wrapped up in a  hurry. There were some loose ends that I would have liked to see sewn up  and was over developed in some spots and underdeveloped in others. It was  so engrossing though that I did not notice this until I read it a second  time. Other than that though this was a fantastic book and a definite  keeper.	2000-07-11

What it lacks in coherent character development it makes up for in charm.  Ten years before the book starts Gabe Falkner saved a 14 year old Ronnie  Dalton from an earthquake wrecked hotel without ever knowing her name. Gabe  is a journalist who managed to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and  has spent a year as a hostage to a rebel leader, in part because of  Ronnies' father illegal activities. Ronnie has hero-worshipped Gabe from a  far from years. She even became a photojournalist because of him and this  situation gives her the opportunity to pay him back by rescuing him. It is  a decent early effort by a great author and well worth the read if you can  find it.	2000-07-09

While Shawn is content with this arrangement Brenna is not.  So rather than  pine for Shawn any longer she decides that the best thing to do is to  proposition him and get him out of her system. Shawn however is the  romantic sort and while he finds Brenna attractive he is not thrilled by  her blunt proposition. Also, he needs a bit to get used to the idea of  Brenna as more than friend. So he turns her down. As you can imagine Brenna  does not feel good about this `rejection' and the story moves forward  beautifully from there.<br />Roberts plays with gender roles in Tears of the  Moon and does a wonderful job of making her hero masculine even though he  acts in a `traditionally' feminine way. Roberts does the same for her  heroine who loves to tinker with machines, build and design houses and  could be considered 'romantically challenged'. They both however come  across as balanced people even though gender roles have obviously been  played with, perhaps precisely because of that.<br />This is a magical, fun  tale set in modern day Ireland. It is the second book in a three book  series and all the original story lines are continued. Aiden and Jude have  been married for a while and we are given a fun look into their life. The  legend and meetings with the Fairy King continue and the end of the book  introduces Darcy's love interest, ... sort of.  While one need not read the  first book to understand this one it does add considerably to the story and  if you have not read it yet, pick up Jewels of the Sun.	2000-07-07

When the story opens Julia and Simon are going to meet face to face for the first time after years of exchanging letters about Egyptology. Only  Simon is shocked to find out that Julia is not the old woman that he had  imagined, but a 27 years old heiress with a body to die for. To find their  way to each other he has to overcome his prejudice against a woman  interested in  `manly pursuits' and she has a life-altering encounter with  a 2000-year-old mummy. Splendid You introduced me to some of the most  engaging secondary characters that I have ever read about with fully  fleshed personalities and complete story lines themselves. There are  encounters with Egyptian gods and goddesses' brushes with reincarnation and  a most interesting spirit who does some great body hopping. This book was a  fun fast read and I unreservedly recommend it if you like stories of this  type.	2000-07-01

This is not the story of Lonnie though but of her  younger sister Lorna who struggles with the idea of sanity and her parents  inability to deal with their own feeling, Lonnie's insanity and with Lorna  at the same time.<br />The Person family is a deeply disturbed family. There  last name an indicator of the distance between them and the world. Both the  mother and father are pill popping suburbanites trapped in a 60's hell.  Lorna is a shy retiring sort who is also an aspiring thespian.<br />While this  was a good effort for a first book it lacked a certain something. I guess  what it lacked was a lasting connection to any of the characters.	2000-06-27

I am not usually a big fan of baseball books but initially I found the layout of this book to be intriguing. The story is  told through a series of letters, notes, report cards and newspaper  clippings. Although there is a rich cast of supporting characters the basic  story line follows the friendship of a lonely boy named Joseph Margolis a  precocious, 95 pound, Jewish weakling, living in Brooklyn during WWII and a  fowl mouthed baseball player named Charles Banks. It tells the story of how  family can be made anywhere and it really did make me laugh and cry. This  was fantastic.	2000-06-23

He is a inventor who accidentally invents an aphrodisiac and well ... you just have to read it. All I have to say is that I usually skip sex scenes in romance novels because they are too contrived and boring but this was waaay steamy.  They are also both charminlgy vulnerable and it was truely wonderful to watch them become friends and lovers.<br />The only complaint that I have about this book is that there are two books before it, in the de Montforte saga, and the first book in that saga, The Wild One, is out of print. I know, waaa.<br />This is a must read book that I hope is part of a must read series. It does have at least one book left in the series, slated to come out in January of 2001.

This book was fifteen years in the making and 3000 women from around the  world contributed to the findings in this book.<br />The report examines the  inherent eroticism of children and how family members' parents and siblings  relate and contribute to this. It also examines how the traditional model  of the nuclear family has contributed to the disenfranchisement of each  member of the family, not just women, but men as well.<br />This is a  fantastically interesting book mainly I think because Shere Hite did not  just pose questions and responses to those question on her questionnaire  but used an essay format. This means that the readers don't just get the  doctors idea of what acceptable responses are but real responses to her  questions.<br />This book is is a fantastic reference for those who are  interested in Women's Studies.	2000-06-19

It has helped me to understand the media's role in my relationship with my body and in the amount of control that I have over it. &quot;Unbearable Weight&quot; has also been a great help in my research on this subject.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to better understand Western Cultures objectification of women's bodies through a feminist filter.	2000-06-18

I am  familiar with the Teach Yourself line of books and have always been  impressed with their quality and this is a quality book. Just not what I  thought that it would be.<br />The author, Donna Baker is apparently a  popular author in Britain, with Mill and Boons books, Harlequin if your in  America, and she refers often to her own books, and other books from the  same genre in this how to book. I do not want to write Harlequins and this  book is written mainly for people who want to write a Harlequin romance.  Unfortunatly that is not apparent with the fifty tag lines that are  provided for the book.<br />Ms. Baker spends the first couple chapters of the  book justifying writing romance novels. Really, if I felt the need to  justify wanting to write romances I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT A BOOK ON HOW TO  WRITE THEM, Jeeze.<br />Those points aside, it is a good how to write book in  general and a good reference on how to write Harlequin romances. I guess  what I really did not like was her constant self-promotion. Writing a  Romantic Novel has so much personal information about Ms. Baker that it is  as much a book for fans of her other books as it is a how to book.<br />It  takes the novice author from the beginning when one creates the characters  to the end getting it to the publishers in a clear and concise manner. It  is for the would be author of shorter 55,000 to 60,000 word romance's.  However, her admittedly good writing advice can be found in a Readers  Digest, `how to write', book. If you just want to get started on a novel go  ahead and browse those. Their titles generally indicate when the books are  for a special market like science fiction or the short story market unlike  this book. Buy one of those if you want a good how to book.	2000-06-13

It has chapters that delve into magazine advertising and its effect on  women, weightism, which is the politically correct form of prejudice among  other things. But unlike most books of this type it does not only tell us  what is wrong but it tells us how to change what's wrong.

As soon as her plane lands it is hijacked by desert rogues. Of  course she is concerned, but then the Crown Prince of El Bahar, Malik Khan,  immediately assures everyone that the boarding of the plane was only a  fantasy being played out for a newly engaged couple. Then Malik and Liana's  eyes meet and they are immediately attracted to each other.  He pretends  indifference at first but then does everything in his power to keep this  single mother with him while she resists out of pride and fear.<br />This is  the third book in a series called Desert Rogues and the third that I have  read and it is just not good. It's like the author got bored with the story  line before she finished her contract. Malik showed up in the other two  books and is acting completely out of character. Susan Mallery's sex scenes  are so contrived and overblown that I could not stand to read them. for  example he \\"searches for the center of her being\\" and a \\"Light dusting of  hair bisected his flat belly, drawing her gaze to his impressive throbbing  need.\\" The author can not even come close to making these two peoples  genitals sound real but later has both of them perform oral sex on the  other.<br />It is like the author found a cardboard copy of what she thought  was the average romance reader and put her in as the main character. She  made the woman blond, a single mother, 20 pounds overweight and an avid  romance reader and she repeats these statistics over and over. Now, I know  as a reader of romance novels that occasionally I am going to get a little  schmaltz, I like a little schmaltz sometimes. What I don't like is being  talked down to and that is what I felt was happening wile I read this  book.<br />The only reason I finished it was because I had read the other two  in the series. That is the only reason to buy this book as well.as well.	2000-06-02

Qualities that I definitely look for in great poetry and work that both genders can appreciate. But, part of what makes Sexton's  poetry so powerful is the context under which it was written. She wrote  deeply p personal poetry about women, about herself. About anger. About  female anger. That is part of the reason her voice is so powerful she and  Sylvia Plath were two women in the mid 20th century who were allowed to be  angry, who reveled in their anger and claimed it. Her poems are not about  abstract ideas, about Grecian Urns, but many of them about her personal  experience as a woman, a wife a daughter. And people bought this. That was  amazing, when you think about the roles of women at that time. Her  collected work is interesting not only as great poetry but also as an  amazing commentary about the status of women of her generation	2000-06-01

Her newest book about an English noblewoman and her Highland husband, Someday Soon, is no exception. This  book has romance intrigue, a great hero and heroine and a strong story  line.<br />Lady Alexander Wilton is one of the most beautiful women in  England. She is also one of the most stubborn, she wants to marry for love.  After three seasons and innumerable marriage proposals her father loses  patience and adds a codicil to his will that forces her to wed the seventh  Earl of Wilton, who everyone thinks is her Cousin Geoffrey. Of course her  father dies soon after adding this to the will. If she does not marry the  seventh Earl all of her fathers un-entailed wealth will go to the Jockey  Club. If this happens Alexander will be without money and her beloved home  will be without funds. Only Geoffrey is not the seventh Earl, a wild  Highlander is. Niall Macdonald is the grandson of a Highland Chief and the  son of the late Earls younger brother. He is the rightful heir.<br />What I  enjoyed so much about this story was that it was a story of equals, while  Wolfe never specifically gave Niall's age it was inferred that he was  around the same age as Lady Alexander who is 21 years old. Niall was kept  from being portrayed as a callow youth by his responsibilities and his care  for his people as the Mac-Mhic-Donnail Chief in training. He vows to never  love a frail English woman even though he is half-English himself and she  is sure that she could never love a Highland barbarian like him. Of course  since this is a romance they are both wrong.<br />Someday soon was a wonderful  book, a quick engaging read with a sweet love story. The main characters  are equals are both likeable characters and most of the secondary  characters are engagingly drawn although if a couple of them had been taken  out it would not have changed the story line really at all.	2000-05-26

The Hero and Heroine are likeablely flawed with an enjoyable personal connection. Sizemore mixes elements in the story from eight years  before when Pirates abducted Honoria and she was seduced by her abductor  and abandoned by her fianc&eacute; with the more prevalent story line set in  present day.  Since she went home she has been living a life of prim  respectability that wis shattered by the reappearance of her former lover  and her ex-fianc&eacute;.<br />There was enough conflict in the book to keep the  story line moving along without making the main characters unlikable and  the secondary characters were interesting as well. I enjoyed the fact that  the story is not set exclusively in Europe and I liked reading a Pirate  romance without actually having to read a pirate story.<br />This book has  followed the recent trend of having slightly older, more powerful women as  main characters and strong yet sensitive men. Men who do not have to abuse  women to be sexy. When it is done well, as it was here, I like it very  much. Women in books like this don't need to run around talking about how  they work for women's issues in order to appear to be powerful women. They  are interesting, powerful women.	2000-05-24

It is set in an exotic, fascinating era, 17th century Japan. It has an engaging mystery, about the death of one of Shoguns concubines, Harume while she is  illicitly tattooing her lovers' name in a secret place and there are many  possible suspects. The main characters in the story are interesting and  sympathetic people. She opens the story at the lead character, Sano  Ichiro's arranged wedding to Reiko, a Japanese woman with a mind of her  own. The untimely death of Harume interrupts the wedding festivities and  immediately set Sano and Reiko in conflict because of their different ideas  of were a woman' s place is.<br />There are many great subplots woven  throughout the story and Rowland has managed to make Ichiro's enemy,  Chamberlain Yanagisawa, a richly drawn and sympathetic character without  losing his menace. Actually all of the important secondary characters are  given a nice depth, as well as the main characters.<br />This was the fourth  book in a Series of books about San Ichiro's work as the Shoguns  investigator and the first that I have read. I am not a regular mystery  reader, the plots are usually a bit to predictable for me and I do not like  the genre enough to put up with shoddy writing. This book however, and I  hope the series, was engaging on several different levels. While it is a  stand-alone book it definitely peaked my interest in finding and reading  all of the books in this series. This is an author that I look forward to  enjoying for years to come.	2000-05-21

I spend so much money and time on romance novels that I want to make sure that I get as much as possible out of them. But life is too short to read crummy novels. This  looked promising, I have read and enjoyed other novels by this author and  the publisher usually publishes quality books especially when it is part of  a series. Not this time though. The Hero and Heroine are just not likeable  and the story line is crummy. Don't bother to pick up this book it is not  worth the time it takes to read the back of the book. It is misleading  because the back blurb makes it look like it may actually be worth buying  when it is not.	2000-05-21

She was often needlessly repetitive and I  think the focus groups she used was restrictive. She focused on the very  young male, the adult/teenage talking to members of the `pussy posse' which  was not a fair barometer of the young male I don't thing. She spoke with  middle-aged men disenfranchised men who had been laid off and a couple of  reformed gang bangers. I just do not believe that her focus group were a  fair example of American men.  But she did make many insightful  observations and the book is interesting, just not as good of a  representation of society that its size would indicate. It's a good book  but pick it up from the library, borrow from a friend or wait until it  comes out in trade. I suppose I just expected more from Faludi because I  would have given anyone else a five.	2000-05-20

A Woman Scorned was one of those rare Regency romance novelswith a heroine who is as powerful as the hero. I loved it. Theheroine, Jonet, is the one with the powerful title, loads of money and hoards of admirer's before her 'fall'. The hero, Cole, while masculine and sexy is definitely the more naïve and not as socially prominent of the two.<br /> Jonet Rowland is living under a cloud of suspicion after the mysterious death of her philandering husband. Her beauty, her power and her unrepentant relationship with a wild young lord (not Cole) all make her appear to be a heartless hussy. Enter Captain Cole Amherst, a soldier who has the heart of a Curate, and the body of a God. He is sent to watch over the lovely Jonet and her two sons by their scheming Uncle as their tutor. In the midst of their personal problems are several `accidents' that threaten the life of Jonet and her sons.<br /> A Women Scorned has a strong plot, some emotional depth, although it could use a bit more characterization, and some really great sex scenes.  One in particular is wonderful. Jonet has a strong managing personality and throughout most of the book initiates and directs her and Cole's sexual encounters. Cole finally has enough and ties her up and has his 'wicked way with her'. Liz Carlyle manages to keep this scene from being a degradation of Jonet by inserting humor into the scene and having Cole stop to make sure she was all right with it before proceeding.<br /> This was a great book, the first of Carlye's that I have read and I greatly enjoyed it and highly recommend it.	2000-05-20

Rejar is a shape-shifting time traveling lover of ladies who seduces a regency miss, Lilac with his `potent charm'.  This book has everythingI look for in a good romance, humor romance and  some great sex scenes. This was the first Dara Joy book that I read and  after I read it I immediately went out and bought all of her other books  which a distressingly few in number. I can not wait until her next book  comes out.	2000-05-20

I love how her world is just like ours only all the things that go bump in the night exist. Hamilton as usual delivers a horrifying,  absorbing read with a strong three dimensional female character. I really  liked the cover art on the book it is beautiful.  But, it really ticks me  off when publishers begin putting books out in hardback halfway through a  series. Serious collectors who would appreciate the hardback want all the  books in hard back and general readers want affordable books. It is very  bad form to introduce the new format, what 7 books in a series. If this is  the first Anita Blake book you have read however, run out and get them all.  It is one of the best multi-genre series on the market.	2000-05-20

Flash Forward though was recommended by someone who's taste I trust so I gave it a try.<br />The  premise is timely and just believable enough to be frightening. In 2004  Scientists at CERN manage to recreate the moment just after the big bang  with catastrophic results. That I will leave alone for the reader to  discover herself. I can say however that it is a wonderful blend of sci-fi,  mystery, and suspense with just a smidgen of romance. It is a slow starter,  it takes 30 or 40 pages to get into but once past those it is a fantastic,  terrifying must read.	2000-05-20

They are well matched in  temperament, intelligence and in their loyalty to their families. It was an  interesting. There is enough conflict to make the story line interesting  and not so much that your left wondering why they ever got together. This  book is a great Sunday afternoon read.	2000-05-20

It is the third book in a series that I hope continues indefinitely about a dying race, the  Carpathinians. After being alive a couple a hundred years they lose the  ability to feel, and to be decent beings without the love of a good woman.  Unfortunately, women are not being born to Carpathinians and generally  humans can not give birth to Carpathinians. Except it seems a woman with  psychic abilities. When a Carpathinian male has lost his ability to feel,  and his hope of finding a mate he turns and becomes a vampire.  Even though  Dark Gold builds on the two proceeding books in the series it stands alone  as a great fantasy romance with a compelling hero, a likeable if not too  bright heroine and great supporting characters. If you like vampire books  this book and the series is a must read.	2000-05-20

The characters were interesting, likeable and had  more depth than many of the more established romance authors have been  giving their characters of late. It has a great mix of romance, sex, danger  and intrigue with a strong and interesting story line. It is a definite  keeper, I have read it twice now and I look forward to reading her new  book. I think I may even break down and buy it in hardcover.	2000-05-19
