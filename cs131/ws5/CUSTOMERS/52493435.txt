Suppresing information, playing dirty politics so often they would've made Nixon proud, and outright lying about reasons as to why they now have the blood of over 800 American Soldiers on their hands.  All the while sullying our American reputation around the world.  Clancy knows what it means to be a TRUE Conservative, without having to be a republican.	2004-05-26

Bush is the most embarassing, shameful, and decietful President in my lifetime (I'm 59).  Secrecy does not bode well in a democratic republic.   This book covers the deceit leading up to the Iraq war, an un-called for war, and a war that put U.S. Soldiers in harms way, needlessly.  All the while the Bush administration was cutting military pay--and losing ground in the war on terror.   Shame on them.	2004-04-20

He was a radical liberal (even the New Testemant--written centuries after Christ's death admits to this), who challanged notions of church bound hierarchy's.  <br />It's a shame that organizational religion (like the Southern Baptist Convention) promotes disdain for what Jesus taught--individual personal relationship with Jesus and God.  Not to mention disobeying Jesus' teachings by mixing their lusting wants for power (government) with their narrow minded brand of cultlike brainwashing.	2004-04-02

Beautifully laid out and printed, and the writing is to the point and unobtrusive.  The artwork is gorgeous throughout and shows the evolution of many ideas leading to the creation of an animated film (in this case from Pixar).  I love the fact that like the Monsters, Inc. book, there are no images from the final film--like all the &quot;Making of&quot; Disney books littered with more stills from the movie than conceptual artwork.

In print form, the WHITE house can clean up and sanitize bush's (often filthy) language.

The legacy of a carefully constructed public image of a presidential candidate put forth to the American Public.  An image constructed not of reality, but of cliche.  Of polls. The very idea of chronicling the CONSTRUCTION of this false image should pull the rug out of anyone wondering if they've ever seen &quot;the real&quot; George W. Bush.  Mind you, the images and information distributed, even today, are only what they want us to see.  Can't blame the campaign as much as the media who eagerly lapped it up...the large corporate media the right wing so often called &quot;liberal.&quot;  What b.s.  These large multinational corporations are big business.  Big business who #1 want the government to get off their backs, and #2, LOVE having free stuff from Bush's staff...they don't have to pay for the pretty images.  This book puts both a capital &quot;C&quot; in cynical, and a capital &quot;H&quot; in hypocrisy.  It's a shame Shrub doesn't read more, this book might just embarass him.	2001-08-20

The writers of this book collectively have very little actual experience, and their limited view of the film making process comes across as naive and ignorant.  Completely bypassing the creative process with pseudo-pop psychology verging on the arrogant, this book should all but prove why the animation industry is in it's current lull. Barely hiding their contempt for the artists in the industry, they openly lay blame not on their own ineptness in understanding the film making process, but the artists whom they believe do not fully understand &quot;their place&quot; in the business.  Mind you, most of the artists in the business have played a part in every aspect of the business and can more than be relied upon to provide elaborate, accurate, and experienced information as to how best to give the best for the most economical.  It's a shame the writers don't give credit for their careers to those who made it remotely possible:  the ARTISTS.	2001-06-13

Along with Shamus Culhane's &quot;Talking Animals and Other People,&quot; the best book on the history of the HOLLYWOOD CARTOON (OK, ok--Fleischer was in New York--and Miami--but you get the idea). The book returns to  Disney again and again as the standard (not the axis) of how these films  were made and marketed.  One of the best things about this book is  something a lot of books seem to talk about, but few show as clearly:   Disney's genius was the idea that CHARACTER and PERSONALITY go a lot  further than slapstick, no matter how good.  It's almost taken for granted  nowadays--but the very idea was revolutionary at the time.  Someone else  may have eventually figured this out (and silence those who call this book  &quot;Disney-centric&quot;), but Disney's was THE place to be in the early  days of cartoon animation.  I wish Mike Barrier would provide a companion  book with illustrations cross referenced with this current book.  And who's  to say it's not in the works... (btw, stay away from Stephen Kanter's  &quot;Serious Business,&quot; another book on animation.  Riddled with  historic and contemporary innaccuracies, it's quite silly altogether...)	2000-01-31

Books	1	5	10	N	Y	Silly Tripe	This book is not very constructive...to say the least...<br />It is poorly typed (I wouldn't say it was &quot;written&quot;) and miserably informed. If the author is really a licensed &quot;private investigator&quot; as  stated on the back of the book, he should have his license  revoked.<br />Singling out Disney for this kind of criticism is hypocritical  considering it's want and need to survive in a business that caters to the  entertainment wants of a majority of the world.  To say that &quot;...but  Disney sells itself as a FAMILY company...&quot; statement, only to then  state the fact that they created other company names to protect that brand  is simply good business. Every other studio in Hollywood does EXACTLY the  same thing.  That Disney continues taking chances on many fronts is to be  admired, even when they miss the mark.<br />The bibliographies reveal that  the book is little more than items either lifted from other (mostly) poorly  researched books (most notably by Marc Eliot--whose own book &quot;Walt  Disney: Dark Prince of Hollywood&quot;--is painfully transparent in it's  use and abuse of fact and fairy tale), or twisted out of context to fit the  author's conservative political viewpoint.  Reminds me of a high school  book report cribbed from the most obvious and uncritical of sources.<br />The  author uses quotes from &quot;Storm Warning,&quot; by Billy Graham--only  &quot;Storm Warning&quot; was actually written by a gay man, Mel White  (author of Reagan's &quot;autobiography&quot; and other books purportedly  written by Pat Robertson and Ollie North).<br />As a Christian myself, I'm  find the author's pushing of a fundimentalist extremist agenda with such  blatent lack of research shameful, and more sadly, BLASPHEMOUS. Perucci  Ferraiulo should seek forgiveness from God for spreading such Un-Godly  conjecture.	1999-01-16
