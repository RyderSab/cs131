Polar Shift, the sixth installment in the NUMA series, is another fantasy story of good versus evil, with the usual predecessor event setting the stage for an eventual tie-in to the main story.  In this case, Cussler pits Kurt Austin and Joe Zavala against a megalomaniac in collusion with a group of anti-globalization zealots.  Although perhaps not as compelling as previous works, Cussler and Kemprecos nonetheless serve up the usual fodder where Kurt and Joe again fight tremendous odds and calmly face down death repeatedly as they battle the antagonists.  Long-time fans will likely find Polar shift to be good, but definitely not great.	2005-10-07
US	50491732	ROV64VNOJHK2Q	0451204891	405050093	The Hearing (Dismas Hardy)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Thoroughly enjoyable	Having read and enjoyed Lescroart's more recent novels featuring Dismas Hardy and Abe Glisky, I went back in search of some of his earlier works.  I picked up The Hearing in hopes of getting some vintage Lescroart.  I was not disappointed.  In fact, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Lescroart built his usual compelling, page-turning work.  For me though, taking this out of order allowed for Lescroart's introduction of a number of characters that I grew to know in subsequent books.  This certainly was an unexpected added dimension and source of enjoyment as I went quickly through the book.  As might be expected, Lescroart does a great job of bringing out raw human emotion in the characters in a way that adds  complexity and depth to the story.  All in all, I'm very glad I went back to The Hearing.  It was well worth the time.	2005-10-07

Again featuring Paul Mandriani as the lead character, Martini treats the reader to a fast-moving, enjoyable read.  In general, Martini has again pulled together an intriguing cast of characters and a compelling story line of murder and government conspiracy.  As the book progresses, the reader is consistently treated to Mandriani's quick wit, sharp mind, and cynical sense of reality in the world.  Courtroom sequences are excellent.  The character development of the supporting characters was strong and clearly added to the storyline, especially the flashbacks related to Mandriani's uncle.  This book will definitely be appreciated by those who have enjoyed other novels with the Mandriani character.  Double Tap grabs you from the first few pages and does not let go.  It was definitely difficult to put down.	2005-09-12

It was different that I had expected, but I came away with a very favorable impression of the author.  Reich presents a story with the financial underpinnings that I had expected.  More than that, however, the story is one of greed, ruthlessness, limitless ego, and geopolitical intrigue.  Reich was able to grab the reader's attention at the very beginning and keep it throughout.  There is an abundance of suspense, plot twists and non-stop action.  Character development is strong, with some very interesting emotional ties among the characters.  I am definitely going back for more of Reich's works.	2005-09-12
US	50491732	RQ4GP1UI3U4AV	0812549449	894141598	No Other Option	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A real page turner	No Other Option is the first novel I've read by Marcus Wynne.  Bottom line:  I will have no other option but to seek out more of his work.  This was a great book.  Wynne grabs you in the first few pages and does not let go.  Wynne provides a solid cast of characters which provide good depth to the storyline.  The story moves forward with pace - full of suspense, plot twists and virtually non-stop action as circumstances pit former friends and colleagues against each other in a battle of wits, determination and physical endurance.  Admittedly, the chief antagonist is a ruthless, remorseless killer.  Thus the story is not for the feint of heart. That said, this was a tough book to put down.	2005-09-12

Despite the substantial length, it was generally a fast and easy, yet compelling, work.  Readers of the first five novels will be familiar with the style, the characters and the various storylines.  In The Half-Blood Prince, Rowling tells another intriguing story of a year in the life of Harry Potter, providing the usual twists, turns and intricacies that readers have come to expect.  In a difference from the previous books which for the most part were self contained, Rowling spends more time in the Half-Blood Prince looking backward in order to provide deeper context to all of the previous books done to date.  Rowling also spends more time setting up the last book which will likely be the most eagerly awaited installment in the series.  All-in-all, the Half-Blood Prince is a very good effort and well worth the time.......even for an adult.	2005-09-12

I had previously read Maxim's Whistler's Angel and had wanted to go back to read the Bannerman series.  With the early books not available at the moment, I decided to start at the end of the series with Bannerman's Ghosts.  Although I suspect that the book would have been better if I was more familiar with some of the characters that clearly had been part of Maxim's previous works, Bannerman's Ghosts was still a great story - fully capable to standing on its own.  Maxim spins an intriguing story, effectively bouncing back between the present and the past while building to an exciting climax.  This is a fast read that will not disappoint.  I will now absolutely need to go back to start at the beginning of the Bannerman series and move forward.	2005-07-15

Torn from the pages of current events in the wake of September 11th, Mills weaves a compelling story of Salem al Fayed (aka Fade) a former Navy SEAL and CIA operative who simply wants to live in obscurity following his service to his country.  A simple twist of fate (and some duplicitous government actions) makes al Fayed both the hunted and the hunter.  Old friendships are challenged, while new allegiances are established.  Character development is very strong, with the reader quickly coming to understand the emotional underpinnings of the characters in support of the main storyline and interwoven subplots.<br /><br />All-in-all, Fade is fantastic.  It will be difficult to put down once you start.	2005-07-15

With previous works primarily centered around large geopolitical conflicts and ground war action, this was Bonds first time venturing into the realm of navel engagement, specifically regarding submarines.  Although I liked Dangerous Ground, I can't say that it was as good as Red Phoenix or Vortex.  Dangerous Ground, while providing a solid story and a compelling look at the undersea world, lacked the gut-wrenching intensity and massive geopolitical issues that filled previous works.  I put this work in the category of \\"good but not great.\\"	2005-06-17

Set in the time before September 11th, Connor is tracking a middle-eastern terrorist known as the Lion, who is in the U.S. to seek revenge.  Told in the first person from Connor's perspective, DeMille provides a humorous (in a sarcastic, deadpan sort of way) character that has depth and likeability.  Connor brings intellect, inquisitiveness, and decisiveness to the story as he seeks to uncover the motivation of the Lion and, with that, increase his ability to predict the Lion's future moves.  I have generally enjoyed the DeMille's books with the Connor character, but I found Lion's Game to be especially good - in part due the strong storyline in which the fictional events portrayed were entirely viable.  DeMille is a great storyteller.  This will be a hard book to put down.  Thankfully I read it on vacation when I could consume large chunks of the book at one time.  Keep in mind that this is the predecessor work to Night Fall and both books would be better if read in the order they were written (which unfortunately was not the way that I did it).	2005-06-17

There is action, intrigue, and plot twists along the way.  Character development is really quite strong (but at times stereotypical), adding substantially to the emotion in the book and enhancing the plot and subplots.  Although some of the action is predictable, there is enough confusion, uncertainty, and surprise to keep the reader moving forward.  Company Man is not as good as Finder's High Crimes, but it is a solid, worthwhile summer read nonetheless.	2005-06-17

There are too many characters (the first hint of trouble is the multi-page listing of characters at the front of the book).  This leads to too little time devoted to character development and too much bouncing around as we follow the many characters around the globe.  The dialog, is terse, contrived, choppy and generally devoid of emotion.  Having loved the Dirk Pitt and Brad Austin line of books from Cussler, I had wanted to like the Oregon Files as well.  Unfortunately, I found Sacred Stone and Golden Buddha to both be underwhelming.	2005-05-16

In doing so, Iles makes the subject matter more palatable, but no less serious.  Although plodding at times, the book finishes strong.  Character development lets the reader understand the egos, anxieties, and motivations of a broad set of characters -- and also drives the reader to form an affinity or antipathy for most characters.  The intensity and buildup of the story, combined with the nature of the subject matter make this a story that is not for the weak of heart.  Although the reader is likely to wince at the details of the story as it unfolds, Blood Memory is a very compelling read.	2005-05-12

Although not his best work, I was not disappointed.  It starts fast with an antecedent event - a murder that occurred more than a decade ago - and then moves quickly into the present in the Pacific Northwest where the characters lead a normal existence, completely unaware of the tumult that about to envelope their lives.  As the story unfolds, Margolin brings forth an intriguing murder mystery / conspiracy thriller.  The author is very effective is his use of movement between the present and the past to tell the story, providing context, depth, and hints at the answers to the many questions that confront the reader.  As was the case with most of Margolin's works, Lost Lake will be a fast, enjoyable read.	2005-05-12

Silva spins his usual tale of intrigue that keeps the reader turning the pages.  The core characters from previous efforts are complemented by a new cast of believable characters that come to life within the pages.  As the story unfolds, Allon demonstrates the physical and mental toughness, decisiveness, patience, perseverance, and survival instincts that made him the best at what he does.  Although Allon is known through prior works, Silva is able to introduce additional historical context and further personal intricacies -- both positive and negative - that add to the enjoyment of the book.  The story provides the usual action, excitement, and intrigue that are Silva's trademark.  From start to finish, this book is impossible to put down.	2005-05-12

Set in the present day, Follett spins a tale focused on a multi-generational, dysfunctional family together in a remote Scottish estate for the Christmas holiday.  The patriarch of the family is a brilliant scientist who created and runs a nearby medical research laboratory.  As the story unfolds, the reader is introduced to a group of nefarious individuals intent on launching a biological terrorist attack in London.  Character development is strong.  Human frailties are exposed.  A series of sub-plots run throughout, adding depth to the main storyline.  Although the story starts a little bit slow, White Out  becomes an impressive, fast-paced tale, full of intrigue, twists, and turns that are classic Follett.  Once you start reading, it will be difficult to stop.	2005-03-01

Having previously read \\"The First Law\\" and \\"Second Chair,\\" I am very comfortable with Lescroart's writing style and the characters themselves.  Lescroart does a great job of bringing out raw human emotion in the characters in such a way that adds a dimension of complexity and depth to the story without getting bogged down as he pulls the reader through twists and turns in the plot.<br /><br />While this latest work is capable of standing on its own, there clearly is value in reading these books in sequence.  There is an added dimension gained from the understanding of people and situations from previous books and how they impact the action in the current work.  For me, this was a page turner.  Fans of Lescroart's previous works should find it be so as well.	2005-02-24

I can't necessarily say it was an enjoyable read, but it definitely kept me turning the pages.  The novel again follows John Connor, a former New York City police detective who is now assigned to the Federal Anti-Terrorist Task Force.  As the story unfolds, Connor is drawn into an unofficial investigation of  TWA Flight 800, which crashed off Long Island in 1996.  Told in the first person from Connor's perspective, DeMille provides a humorous (in a sarcastic, deadpan sort of way) character that has depth and likeability.  Connor brings intellect, inquisitiveness, and decisiveness to the story as he seeks to retrace and uncover 5-year-old clues and outwit the forces arrayed against him.  As with many of the other reviewers, I was a bit disappointed by the ending.  I suppose that from a certain perspective it was the only ending possible.  On the other had, having been generally engrossed on the journey through the story, the ending left me shaking my head and wishing for something different.	2005-02-24

According to Zaltman, (1) thought is based on images, not words; (2) most communication is non-verbal;  (3) metaphors are central to thought and (4) memory is fragile.  The book is very well researched (and footnoted) and well written, with abstract concepts presented with real-life examples that support the thesis being presented.  In the end you may not buy into all of the conclusions reached by Zaltman, but the material is sufficiently compelling to least warrant serious consideration.  The material will clearly make you think about previous assumptions.  If you do market research or make decisions based on market research, Zaltman's book should be part of your professional reading for 2005.	2005-01-08

The time Cussler shares authorship with his son, Dirk Cussler.  While it is hard to tell how much of the work was written by father versus the son, the end result is a page turner in true Cussler style.  The partnership is appropriate, since not only does the authorship cross generations, but the protagonists do as well.  The plot of Black Wind features both Dirk Pitt Sr and Dirk Pitt Jr as they battle a Korean megalomaniac intent on uniting North and South Korea under the control of the North.  The usual predecessor event (in this case an attempt by the Japanese to attach the northwest coast of the United States during WWII) sets the stage for an eventual tie-in to the main story.  Unlike some of the plots (and antagonists against whom Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino have done battle) in previous works, the underlying premise in Black Wind does not push the envelope of one's imagination.  The story is entirely believable, which in my mind makes it better than some of Cussler's reality-stretching novels.  This is simply a very good novel filled with all of the action, suspense, and frequent plot twists that have become Cussler's trademark.  Once you start this book, it will be very difficult to put down.	2005-01-08

Books	3	2	2	N	N	Ludlum Lite	Paris Option is the third installment of the Covert One series that I have read.  As a long-time Ludlum fan, I am still trying to get used to the series.  Up to this point, the tales have been lighter and clearly not as complex as the typical Ludlum fare.  This is not all bad, however, as the concept of  \\"Ludlum Lite\\" has a certain appeal in its own right - although true Ludlum aficionados may be disappointed.  If you are considering picking up the Covert One books, I would recommend starting with The Hades Factor to provide a nice foundation in terms of character building for future works in the series.  With Paris Option, character development continues from the earlier work, leading to a quick read.  All-in-all, not great but not bad.	2004-12-23

Not surprisingly, the Wolf has returned as the nemesis of Alex Cross.  In a bit of a twist, however, Patterson brings back The Weasel, Cross' nemesis several books back, to team up with the Wolf in a murderous, high-stakes extortion and terrorism plot.  The storyline itself is not bad at all, starting strong and keeping pace throughout.  My only complaint is that the dialog is choppy and the story seems a bit jumpy, in part because Cross is bouncing around the world in an attempt to track the Wolf and bring him to justice.  All-in-all, this work is clearly not spectacular.  It is, however, worth a quick read.	2004-12-23

In Hour Game, Baldacci brings back Sean King and Michelle Maxwell, the main protagonist characters from his previous work, Split Second.  King and Maxwell, having ended their careers in the Secret Service, are now partners in a private investigator firm in a small town in Virginia.  The quiet of the small town quickly comes to an end, however, with the death of a woman who works at a local gentlemen's club.<br /><br />As more deaths are uncovered, King and Maxwell are drawn in to help solve the mystery and stop the unknown killer, eventually becoming targets themselves.  Hour Game is able to hold the reader's attention with the hallmarks that have become Baldacci's trademark: action, suspense, and plot twists.  The story line is solid, moving at a rapid pace.  A wide range of believable characters provides depth and breadth to the plot.  Hour Game is an absolute page turner that should be a hit for those who have liked Baldacci's previous works-especially his early novels.	2004-11-29

With the Second Chair, Lescroart spins a intriguing tale - one that is clearly better than The First Law.  Perhaps my familiarity with some of the characters this time around helped.  Throughout the story, Dis Hardy and Abe Glisky continue to search for their way in life in the wake of the action in the First Law, adding an extra dimension for those who have read the previous book.  That said, my sense is that, while the exposure to the previous work was beneficial, the plot here was simply more compelling.  The Second Chair is clearly a page turner that grabs the reader early and keeps him guessing.  Prepare for some level of sleep deprivation as you stay up too late in order to read \\"just one more chapter.\\"	2004-10-28

He then immediately jumps to the present with the tracking of a killer by a famed and feared LAPD detective squad on a train bound for L.A.  The reader is quickly swept up in the non-stop, spectacular action that covers the first third of the book.  In this portion, character development and dialog are strong and raw emotional elements are exposed.  The plot itself gets bogged down a bit in the middle of the book, at least in part because the intensity is difficult to carry forward over such a large number of pages.  As the story unfolds, the loose ends begin to come together and the precursor event from the very first pages gets tied in with the events from the present.  While the plot line tends at times to be implausible, Folsom nonetheless keeps the reader engaged and moving forward through the pages.  I found it easy to go through the book in large gulps.  All-in-all, this is a solid effort from Folsom - not as good as Day After Tomorrow, but well worth the time if the prospect of a 700-page book does not scare you away.	2004-10-20

I had not read any of Lescroart's other works and did not know what to expect.

Character development was solid, although I suspect that the book would have been better is I was more familiar with some of the characters that clearly had been part of Lescroart's previous works.  The First Law was not spectacular but it was definitely good enough that I will be back to sample more of Lescroart's works.	2004-09-29

The action and frequent battle scenes that typically fill Coyle's works were largely absent here.  Instead, Coyle takes the reader on a journey of preparation that leads to the action at the end.  During the build-up, Coyle goes on at length about the duty, honor, courage and valor of the soldier, regardless of rank or nation of origin.  While this is clearly a noble position to take, the presentation of this theme seems to overwhelm.	2004-09-29

Since reading it many, many years ago, I have read all of his works.  Through it all, the three novels that make up Ludlum's Bourne trilogy were my favorites from all of his novels.  At the same time, I had not read anything from Eric van Lustbader.  Thus I had to decide whether to pass on the Bourne Legacy (and simply let the Bourne character die with Ludlum, leaving nothing but fond memories for me) or take a chance on a new author (who could potentially ruin the Bourne character).  All things considered, I can honestly say that I am glad that I took the time to read the Bourne Legacy.  The book, however, is clearly far from spectacular.  The characters are more transparent and stereotyped and the storyline is far less complex and more predictable than those in the Bourne trilogy under Ludlum.  To his credit, Lustbader does keep the reader tuning the pages with frequent action sequences (although some stretch reality a bit too far).  He also creates a plausible storyline that plays on the current geopolitical landscape and the war on terror.  All-in-all, your view of this book will likely depend on your history with the Bourne character.  Bourne lovers may find this to be disappointing.  Readers who are new to the character may very well be happy with this entry in the spy-thriller genre.	2004-09-09

In this case, Cussler pits Kurt Austin and Joe Zavala against a highly secretive family with a long history of armament development and production and a desire to create the elixir of life.  At the same time, their NUMA compatriots seek to find the source of a mutating plant life that threatens the world's oceans.  As would be expected, Kurt and Joe again fight tremendous odds and calmly face down death repeatedly as they battle the demented antagonists.  The novel is filled with all of the action, suspense, and frequent plot twists that have become Cussler's trademark.

Although my early guess ultimately was proven to be correct, the work was still very entertaining as Margolin brought everything together for a strong closing to the book.	2004-08-20

In a reprise of Gabriel Allon, the art restorer and sometimes Israeli spy from previous novels, Silva spins a tale of intrigue that keeps the reader turning the pages.  The core characters from previous efforts are complemented by a new cast of believable characters that come to life within the pages. The story provides the usual action, excitement, and intrigue that are Silva?s trademark.  At the same time, deep emotional issues (some known to readers of previous works and some newly introduced in this latest effort) facing Gabriel provide an added dimension to the action.  If you read and enjoyed The English Assassin and The Confessor, then A Death in Vienna is a must.	2004-07-23

Mitch Rapp and Dr. Irene Kennedy are back, along with the other characters from his previous books.  The book is set in 2004 when, just prior to the dedication of the new WWII memorial in Washington DC, Kennedy and Rapp must react to intelligence that points to another attack on the US.  Amidst another fast-paced page-turner filled with plenty of action, suspense, and geopolitical intrigue, Flynn challenges the reader to think about how the US needs to deal with the war on terror.  Is the Patriot Act insufficient or overbearing?  What rules of engagement can or should be employed?  If you are a fan of Flynn's previous works, you likely know which side of the debate that Mitch Rapp occupies.  You will also not be disappointed with the latest effort.  It is a great read that will keep you up at night reading.	2004-07-23

Although Carmellini had been a character in recent novels, Grafton still was in the spotlight.  Now Coonts makes the shift from Grafton to Carmellini with great effect, leveraging the traditional strengths of the Grafton character while extending and deepening Carmellini's character.  Liars & Thieves is told from the first-person perspective of Carmellini, which serves to effectively provide a deep look into his heart and the inner workings of his mind.  Character development on some of the secondary characters adds to the storyline as well.  Bottom line:  Liars & Thieves is a strong read.  Despite some editing snafus, it provides a fresh perspective along with a sense of familiarity.  The action is fast paced, with twists that keep the reader turning the pages.  Don't wait for the paperback......read Liars & Thieves now.	2004-06-18

Each grows up in worlds that are parallel but different.  As the decades pass, Archer takes the brothers through a variety of life experiences that were relevant and important in their day.  At the same time, the lives of the brothers inevitably become more and more entwined.  Although character development is solid, the story itself gets bogged down in places and leaves huge gaps in time in others.  That said, Archer kept me turning the pages.  Although this is not among Archer's best, his fans may want to at least give this a chance.	2004-06-15

Brad Denning has grown up with the haunting guilt that he is responsible for the disappearance of his younger brother when they were both kids.  After years of tortuous thoughts about what his life and the lives of his family members would have been like if he could have a \\"do over\\" on that fateful day, his brother unexpectedly comes into his life.  A happy reunion quickly turns sour and Brad finds himself in a life and death struggle.  As he searches for his wife and son, he slowly comes to fully understand the path of destruction set in motion after his brother disappeared.  It is story of a simple twist of fate with very negative consequences.  Although choppy in places and with a subject matter that is clearly not for the squeamish, Morrell effectively uses the first person narrative to tell the story from Brad Dennings' perspective.  The frequent twists, turns and action sequences make Long Lost a very quick read.  All things considered, Long Lost is good but not great.	2004-06-15

This was a phenomenal book, clearly among my personal top-five list.  In Point of Impact, Hunter presents Bob Lee Swagger (AKA \\"Bob the Nailer\\" due to his reputation as a Marine sniper during the Vietnam War) in a fast-paced conspiracy thriller.  Hunter hooks you in the first few pages of the book as Swagger is hunting on his property in Arkansas.  As the story unfolds, Swagger demonstrates the physical and mental toughness, decisiveness, patience, perseverance, and survival instincts that made him the best at what he does.  Throughout the book, one comes to know and further appreciate the intricacies, both positive and negative, of being \\"Bob the Nailer.\\" Action sequences and character development are interwoven and provide a complementary blend throughout the book.  From start to finish, this book is impossible to put down.	2004-05-23

I'm glad I did.  Nance takes the reader on a page-turning adventure than starts with the unexplained crash of a U.S. passenger jet in the Caribbean.  The story quickly shifts to a meeting in Hong Kong where an FBI agent Kat Bronsky (who specializes in airline terrorism) meets up with Washington Post reporter Robert McCabe (who claims to know something about the downing of the plane).  Nance then chronicles the efforts of this pair to uncover the truth regarding the downing of the first jet (and those that come later).  Blackout is clearly a page turner that grabs the reader early and keeps him guessing.  Prepare for some level of sleep deprivation as you stay up too late in order to read &quot;just one more chapter.&quot;	2004-05-23

I am slowly but surely working my way back through the archive of Alex Cross novel from Patterson.  All things considered, Pop Goes the Weasel is a solid effort by Patterson.  The author  presents another supremely evil antagonist against whom Cross is pitted, with the added twist of a very personal involvement on the part of Cross.  Although the Alex Cross formula makes things a bit predictable (and the references to cases solved in previous books become too repetitive), Patterson is nonetheless able to keep the reader turning the pages.	2004-05-07

While the premise itself stretches one's imagination, Coonts nonetheless presents a compelling story that features Jake Grafton, the no-nonsense US Naval Officer, who in this case has a very personal reason to bring his skills and determination to bear.  Coonts brings together a range of characters, while effectively blending a number of sub-stories within the main story.  I recommend Hong Kong.  You will want to go through it quickly.	2004-05-07

Friedman's Inadmissible Evidence met the need.  In the story, Manhattan assistant DA Joe Estrada is called upon to retry a murder/rape case.  Friedman weaves together a number of storylines that, in the end, lead to a compelling story.  I can't say that it was a quick read.  Nor did it necessarily provide edge-of-your-seat suspense.  Friedman did, however, pull together a compelling story with sufficient depth and character development to hold my interest throughout.	2004-04-16

There is action, excitement, intrigue, and frequent plot twists.  In the story itself, underachiever Adam Cassidy finds himself presented with an offer that he cannot refuse.  Adam quickly is in the middle of a complicated industrial espionage scheme between two high-tech companies.  As the story unfolds and the pressure increases, Adam is increasingly conflicted.....clearly in a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't situation.  Although some of the action is predictable, confusion, uncertainty, and surprise is the general rule, thus driving the reader to want to read \\"just one more chapter.\\"  Character development is strong, adding significantly to the plot and subplots.  Although not as good as Finder's &quot;High Crimes,&quot; I strongly recommend Paranoia.  It should prove to be an entertaining read.	2004-04-15

It is a classic Cussler story of good versus evil.  As would be expected, Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino again fight tremendous odds and calmly face down death repeatedly as they race against the clock to unearth and then thwart the evil scheme being hatched by Spencer.  Adding to the storyline is the inclusion of Dirk and Summer, Pitt's twin children who appeared out of the blue at the end of Valhalla Rising.  This is simply a very good novel filled with all of the action, suspense, and frequent plot twists that have become Cussler's trademark.  In addition, after all of the action has been concluded, there is still a chapter or two that provide some material that Cussler fans should find interesting.  All-in-all, if you have enjoyed the adventures of Pitt and Giordino over the years, Trojan Odyssey should keep you turning the pages as well.	2004-03-01

Hence, my point of reference is not the same as that of long-time Patterson readers, many of whom speak disparagingly of his latest effort.  From my perspective, the Big Bad Wolf had the makings of a good detective novel - an evil antagonist, a growing list of unsolved abductions, and a cerebral detective who remains relentlessly in pursuit.  For me, the pages went quickly.  Nothing in this book will keep me from picking up future works (and continuing to go back to earlier efforts that I have not yet read.	2004-02-16

Tristan Betrayal clearly has the underpinnings of a Ludlum spy novel.  At the same time, however, it does not contain the deep intricacies that were the hallmark of his earliest work.  That said, this was still an enjoyable read.  This book grabs the reader early as US Ambassador Stephen Metcalfe arrives in Moscow during the volatility of Russia in the early 1990s.  The reader is then quickly taken back in time to occupied France in WWII.  As the story unfolds, a young Metcalf  is stationed in France as an intelligence agent.  As the plot progresses, Metcalf must overcome physical and emotional challenges.  Every so often the reader is transported back to the setting at the beginning of the book - Moscow in the early 1990s.  While Ludlum aficionados may yearn for the old days, the Tristan Betrayal still is worth a quick read.  It is solid, but not spectacular.	2004-02-16

This changed when I picked up Cassandra Compact in an airport bookstore.  Having enjoyed Cassandra Compact, I decided to go back to the beginning of the series.  With The Hades Factor, I was not disappointed.  The tale, although lighter and clearly not nearly as complex as the typical Ludlum, kept me turning the pages.  This book, which grabs the reader early and does not let go, contains much of the suspense and plot twists that Ludlum aficionados have come to love in the conspiracy-thriller genre.  If you are considering picking up the Covert One books, I would recommend starting with The Hades Factor.  It is a very quick read and provides a nice foundation in terms of character building for future works in the series.	2004-01-05

Having seen (and enjoyed) a couple of the movies based on books by James Patterson, I decided to finally take a shot at one of the books itself, starting first with Violets are Blue.  Although not the highest rated of Patterson's efforts, I went through it quickly and thoroughly enjoyed it.  This book grabs the reader early and does not let go, effectively weaving together two main storylines (a cross-country murder spree and the Mastermind's pursuit of Alex Cross).  Clearly, however, the book is not for the feint of heart - the body count is substantial and the vampire murders are described in graphic detail.  Delicate subject matter notwithstanding, Patterson kept me turning the pages.	2003-12-23

Citing his work with the US Marine Corps, firefighters and certain business organizations, Klein lays out his theory that intuition is something to be valued, developed and leveraged.  To push his thesis, he tends to beat up on analytics and metrics in decision making - so much so that people with a strong analytical bent (like me) might dismiss the thesis as rubbish.  Keeping an open mind, however, makes one see that what Klein is really advocating is a blend of intuition and analytics.  In fact, a number of the tools outlined by Klein to build up intuition are somewhat analytical in nature - in effect creating a situation where one can intuitively decide something today because of \\"pre-analysis\\" that had been done in the past.  Although the concepts are presented more from an anecdotal perspective than from a rigorous scientific one, Klein is able to nonetheless put forth a concept that merits attention, if for no other reason that to gain a perspective on different management styles the one must deal with on a regular basis.	2003-12-04

He spins a tale of the aging Don of a powerful New York crime family who yearns-and plans-for a day when future generations of his family can transition from the world organized crime to that of legitimate enterprise.  As the story unfolds, the Don, who is at the same time a strategic thinker and a ruthless tactician, attempts to influence people and events in order to realize his long-term vision.  Along the way, Puzo lays out a wide range of colorful, although stereotypical, characters in a story that brings a variety of disparate storylines together as the book progresses.  Puzo effectively moved back and forth from the present to the past to provide depth and understanding.  In the end though, the book never really grabbed me or prompted any sleep deprivation due to late nights spent reading.  The Last Don was definitely not great, but not bad either.	2003-12-04

The central character, Calvin Dexter, is a complicated man.  On the surface, he is a successful small-town gentleman lawyer, who in his spare time trains as a tri-athlete.  Below the surface, he has a history as a highly skilled Viet Nam veteran and, as the reader comes to find out, in the present day operates secretively as the Avenger - the righter of wrongs for people with no where else to go.<br />As the story opens, the grandson of a very wealthy Canadian businessman is brutally murdered in Bosnia, setting the wheels in motion for a contract with the Avenger to bring those responsible to justice.  Forsythe effectively intermingles past and present to lay the foundation for the storyline, introduce a host of characters, and to bring meaning and motivation to Dexter's character.  Dexter has blue-collar roots and is an up-from-the-bootstraps success story.  Highly intelligent, although not highly educated (his law degree notwithstanding), Dexter comes from the school of hard knocks - able to think strategically and tactically.  He is a character with an abundance of courage, integrity and personal fortitude - all of which will be required as he goes up against seemingly impossible odds to fulfill.<br />Forsythe is able to effectively weave cultural and political facts and actual events into the story to provide a realistic backdrop for the action - and there IS action.  Avenger was very difficult to put down.  The story moves forward with pace - full of suspense and plot twists that the reader has come to expect from Forsythe.  For anyone interested in the action thriller genre, Avenger is a \\"must read.\\"	2003-11-11

If that were not enough to keep a manager up at night, many are also facing disruptions from rapidly changing technologies.  In his book entitled, The Innovator's Dilemma, Clayton Christensen tackles the concept of disruptive technologies - what they are, how they are nurtured, and how they have the potential to turn previously successful companies into the roadkill of capitalism.  This book is well written and insightful, bringing the concepts to life with a variety of real-life examples.  I highly recommend this book for business executives, both those who are living the experience today and those who think they are immune.  For me, it is on to the just published sequel, The Innovator's Solution.	2003-11-11

If you truly enjoyed the preceding efforts by Higgins, then you might like Edge of Danger (because it is more of the same).  However, if you have been growing disenchanted by Higgins' efforts, then you probably want to take a pass on this (and for me at least, future efforts as well).  Higgins' books are more and more like screen plays and less and less like novels.  Dialog between the characters, which often is terse, choppy, and unimaginative, makes up virtually all of the text.  Higgins almost completely avoids the opportunity add any depth and breadth to the story through the use of descriptive text.  As with the last few books from Higgins, Edge of Danger is clearly a disappointment.	2003-10-30

Not knowing exactly what to expect, but having read an enjoyed the previous solo works from Philip Shelby, I decided to give the Cassandra Compact a try when faced with a need to pick up a book at an airport bookstore.<br />In short, I was pleasantly surprised.  The tale, although lighter and clearly not nearly as complex as the typical Ludlum, kept me turning the pages.  This book, which grabs the reader early and does not let go, contains much of the suspense and plot twists that Ludlum aficionados have come to love in the conspiracy-thriller genre.  Upon final evaluation, the Cassandra Compact made my four-hour plane ride easy duty.  My first experience with the series will make me go back to the beginning to try some of the others.	2003-10-22

Thankfully the opportunity to get the book one week before broad publication coincided with a trip that afforded me ample airport and airplane reading time that allowed me to plow through the book.  I was not disappointed.  Split Second is clearly a page turner that grabs the reader early and keeps him guessing.  Prepare for some level of sleep deprivation as you stay up too late in order to read \\"just one more chapter.\\"<br />Split second chronicles the saga of two Secret Service agents, Sean King and Michelle Maxwell, who are both disgraced in seemingly separate events that take place years apart.  As the mystery unfolds, King and Maxwell are brought together to follow a trail of clues (and dead bodies) as they pursue the unknown antagonist.  Although not as good as Total Control or Absolute Power, which I think were Baldacci's best efforts, Split Second is able to hold a reader's attention with the hallmarks that have become his trademark:  action, suspense, and plot twists.  Any eccentricities in the storyline are made up for with solid character development.  There is romantic tension among King, Maxwell, and King's former lover.  The broad set of characters presented by Baldacci possess a variety of personal motivations that expose the gamut of human frailties.  Split Second should be a hit for those who have liked Baldacci's previous works-especially his early novels.	2003-09-30

Coyle's latest is a strong, compelling story --- a real page turner from the very beginning of the book. Coyle grabs the reader and does not let go.  Character development is strong.  Coyle excels in his ability to portray duty, honor and courage right next to the anxiety, turmoil and inner conflict experienced by combatants and military planners.  All in all, this is a very strong effort from Coyle.  In fact, I think that More than Courage in on a par with The Ten Thousand, which I found to be Coyle's best previous work.	2003-09-17

In Teeth of the Tiger, readers find themselves in Clancy's first attempt to bring the post-September 11th world of terrorism into his storyline.  Brian, a US Marine, and Dominic, an FBI agent, are recruited to be the muscle for an off-the-books organization whose charter is to protect the US from terrorist acts using techniques not allowed by agencies covered by governmental oversight issues.  Jack Jr. follows in his father's footsteps as an analyst for the same organization.<br />The book itself spins an interesting tale of intrigue, spycraft, human emotion and motivation, and ideological differences.  The build-up and action sequences keep the pace of the book moving, although the conversation between characters seemed a bit contrived.  My real complaint was that the book seemed to end rather abruptly, not taking the main story further than it did and leaving the sub-plots hanging.  It almost seemed as if this was the first half of what was a very long book that, at the end of the day, Clancy and/or his editors decided to split into two books.  All-in-all, not bad, but clearly not among Clancy's best.	2003-09-08

Despite the substantial length, it was generally a fast and easy, yet compelling, work.  Readers of the first four novels will be familiar with the style, the characters and the various storylines.  In The Order of Phoenix, Rowling tells another intriguing story of a year in the life of Harry Potter, who is more rebellious and clearly more consistently angry than in past works.  In this book, the plot builds upon what preceded it and provides the usual twists, turns and intricacies that readers have come to expect.  The Order of Phoenix has a strong start and a strong finish, with the book clearing up some of the mysterious unknowns from the previous books.  Thus Rowling pulls things together quite well in the end, while also setting the stage for the next installment.  All-in-all, the Order of Phoenix is a very good effort and is well worth the time...even for an adult.	2003-08-27

In this case, Cussler pits Kurt Austin and Joe Zavala against Oceanus Corporation, a highly secretive fish farming organization that seeks to corner the fish market with its genetically engineered fish.  As would be expected, Kurt and Joe again fight tremendous odds and calmly face down death repeatedly as they battle a demented leader of Oceanus and the thugs in his employ.  The novel is filled with all of the action, suspense, and frequent plot twists that have become Cussler's trademark.  My only complaint was that the writing of Cussler and Kemprecos seemed to be choppy and abrupt at times.  This minor gripe notwithstanding, the faithful followers of Clive Cussler will find White Death to be an enjoyable summer read.	2003-08-05

This is a fast-paced, page-turning thriller. The main character is Cavanaugh, a former Delta Force commando who now works as a protector for Global Protective Services.  When his latest assignment takes a terrible turn, Cavanaugh becomes both the hunter and the hunted as he tries to unravel the mystery and extract a basic form of justice.  Beyond the plot's twists, turns, action, and suspense, Morrell brings together an interesting cast of characters who complement Cavanaugh's character.  All-in-all, The Protector is a real winner from Morrell.  His fans will clearly be happy with this latest effort.	2003-06-30
US	50491732	R2CX80GRDMDK84	0446605409	348227423	Plum Island	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Well done	Plum Island was an entertaining, enjoyable book - filled with subplots and multiple storylines that keep the reader engaged.  The novel follows John Connor, a New York City police detective who is spending time on the north shore of Long Island recovering from wounds sustained on the job.  He is pulled into the investigation of the double murder of a couple he was acquainted with.  As the story unfolds, Corey must test his physical abilities and emotional ties to the case while using his intellect, inquisitiveness, and decisiveness to outwit the forces arrayed against him as he seeks to solve this crime.  Told in the first person from Corey's perspective, DeMille provides a humorous (in a sarcastic, deadpan sort of way) character that has depth and likeability.  Plum Island was worth my time.	2003-06-19

Although the concepts are presented more from an anecdotal perspective than from a rigorous scientific one, Gladwell is able to nonetheless put forth a concept that merits attention.	2003-06-19

Torn from the pages of current events, Jake Grafton is appointed by the President to lead a small team charged with finding four nuclear weapons believed to be on their way to the US.  Fighting against the clock and the internecine battles among the various US agencies, Grafton get into the heads of the terrorists and anticipate the end game.  Coonts brings together a range of characters, while blending a number of sub-stories within the main story.  The book moves very quickly.  It will be difficult to put down.	2003-05-28

Picking up where Separation of Power left off, Mitch Rapp and Dr. Irene Kennedy are back, along with the other characters from his previous three books, in a very compelling political thriller.  Rapp has recently returned from his honeymoon, only to be thrust into another perilous situation much to the dismay of his new bride.  Terrorism, Middle East turmoil and the Palestine question are at the center of the story.  As is his trademark, Flynn grabs the ready early, sets the hook and does not let go.  Executive Power is another fast-paced page-turner, filled with plenty of action, suspense, and geopolitical intrigue.  If you are a fan of Flynn?s previous works, you will not be disappointed with the latest effort.	2003-05-28

Against the backdrop of the mind-game battles with those in Congress who do not want to see McCarvey lead the CIA, McGarvey must wage a battle for his life (and the lives of his family members) as he tries to unravel a long-dormant contract on his life.  The story moved along at a fast pace, with plenty action and suspense.  The carryover of characters from previous books provides a sense of familiarity as the book progresses.  Although perhaps not his best effort, The Kill Zone is clearly worth your time.	2003-04-28

I would rate it as better than Wild Justice and as good as The Associate.  Following an intriguing prolog, the main story starts fast and never lets up.  The story is set in the Pacific Northwest with the Jaffe father-daughter legal team profiled in Wild Justice.  Amanda Jaffe is called upon to represent a suspected murderer.  In the process, she begins to uncover a massive conspiracy that challenges her ability to retain her sanity and ultimately threatens her and her family.  Although this story is clearly better having read Wild Justice, it still is good enough to stand on its own merits.  Once you start, it will be very difficult to stop.	2003-04-15

In a story of a Washington DC public defender turned mass tort attorney, Grisham brings together an interesting cast of characters.  In tackling the mass tort issue, Grisham focuses on an area of the law that will increasingly impact many, either directly or indirectly.  Regardless of whether you believe that the cadre of mass tort lawyers are philanthropic fighters for the common man or a greedy, self-serving scourge upon industry and the economy, there is something in this novel that will infuriate you and also resonate with your line of thinking.  The story is an intriguing one.  The pace is steady and builds throughout.  Although not as good as some of the vintage legal thrillers done by Grisham early in his career, The King of Torts is probably worth the time and effort.	2003-03-27

It was a definite page turner - clearly to put down.  In a reprise of Gabriel Allon, the art restorer and sometimes Israeli spy from previous novels, Silva spins a tale of intrigue regarding internecine battles within the modern Catholic Church.  Gabriel is called on to investigate the death of a friend and fellow agent.  In the process, he uncovers an effort by a powerful group within the Catholic Church at the Vatican to protect a secret regarding the church's complicity with the treatment of the Jews by the Germans in WWII.  The core characters from previous efforts are complemented by a new cast of believable characters that come to life within the pages. The story provides action, excitement, intrigue and plot twists up to the very end.  The effective inclusion of flashbacks add valuable context throughout the story.  There is no question........this is a book worth reading.	2003-03-27

This book should definitely be enjoyable to those who have enjoyed other novels with the Mandriani character.  In general,  Martini has again pulled together an intriguing cast of characters and an interesting story line, including the bonus of having a story with a bit more pace than some of his other works .  The story starts with the murder of Mandriani's colleague and a defendant on the courthouse steps.  Mandriani, who was in earshot of the gunfire and also was almost the defendant's lawyer instead of his colleague, is left to wonder about what might have been if fate had taken a different turn.  Mandriani is pulled in to help settle the estate and get to the bottom of the murder.  As the book progresses, the reader is consistently treated to Mandriani's quick wit, sharp mind, and cynical sense of reality in the world.	2003-02-23

The story itself takes Kirk McGarvey, former CIA assassin and currently among the top men in the CIA, back out into the field to negotiate with Osama bin Laden.  Events quickly spin out of control and McGarvey finds himself fighting for the safety of his family, the President's family and millions of Americans.  At the same time, McGarvey must thwart bin Laden's plan to set off a tactical nuclear device in San Francisco.  McGarvey portrays a cool, confident, cerebral agent, yet also displays emotion sufficient to indicate that more than ice water runs through his veins.  The story moved along at a fast pace, with a plethora of action and suspense.  This was the second of Hagberg's book that I have read.  I will clearly be going back for more.	2003-02-10

I had not read any of Maxim's other works and did not know exactly what to expect. This first exposure will have me going back for more. Maxin spins an intriguing story, effectively bouncing back between the present and the past while building to an exciting climax. The book follows Adam Whistler, an ex-special forces soldier and government assassin who is fighting the realities of his past and the corruption of his superiors, and Claudia (who believes she has been tasked with being Adam's guardian angel following her own brush with death) as they come to grips with events that have brought them together. Whistler's Angel is packed with action, suspense, plot twists and good character development. I suspect, however, that the book would have been better is I was more familiar with some of the characters that clearly had been part of Maxim's previous works. I suppose it is time to go back to the early Maxim, starting with the Bannerman series.	2002-12-31

Next on the list was Wild Justice.  I was not disappointed.  It starts fast and moves forward at a quick pace throughout.  Wild Justice is filled with action, suspense, plot twists and good character development.  The story is set in the Pacific Northwest as a father-daughter legal team represents two defendants accused of a string of brutal serial killings.  (Despite the compelling nature of the story, the intensity of the subject matter and detailed descriptions in regards to the serial murders mean that this work is not for the faint of heart.)  My only real complaint with the book was that I was able to deduce the identity of the perpetrator too early in the book.  Although my early guess ultimately was proven to be correct, the work was still very entertaining as Margolin brought everything together for a great closing to the book.	2002-12-13
US	50491732	R1ZK5NDASXEPU4	0399149341	786063504	Sphere of Influence	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A strong effort from Mills	I've read and enjoyed all of the novels from Kyle Mills.  They keep getting better and better.  Sphere of Influence, however, is clearly Mills' best effort to date - very tight and fast paced.  Mark Beamon, the SAC of the Phoenix office of the FBI, again finds himself as a bit of a lost soul battling his physical and emotional insecurities as he searches for the truth in this political action/thriller.  Beamon, although a thorn in the FBI's side due to his maverick tenancies, again demonstrates the mental skills, perseverance, and apolitical perspective that make him the FBI's top investigator.  Torn from the pages of current events in the wake of September 11th, Mills weaves a compelling story on al-Qaeda, terrorism, the drug trade, and the Mob.  This is page turner that will be difficult to stop once you start.<br />This book is clearly capable of standing on its own.  Part of my enjoyment of this story, however, was the history that I had built up with Beamon in \\"Rising Phoenix,\\"  \\"Storming Heaven,\\"  \\"Free Fall\\" and \\"Burn Factor.\\"  If you enjoyed the previous work, you will no doubt enjoy \\"Sphere of Influence.\\"  In you have not read the others, you might want to consider taking these books in order.	2002-12-05

(With each passing book, one is left to wonder if there are any more finished or nearly finished transcripts in the pipeline or even to what degree the last two works were ghost written, at least in part.)  Having read almost all of Ludlum's work, the Jansen Directive certainly felt like \\"a Ludlum.\\"  This was a great book....very hard to put down.<br />This book grabs the reader early and does not let go, leading on more than one occasion to fits of yawning in the morning because I had stayed up too late reading the night before.  All in all, the Jansen Directive provides all of the action, suspense, frequent plot twists, and unexpected events that Ludlum aficionados have come to love in the conspiracy-thriller genre.  This is clearly among Ludlum's best.	2002-11-25

Jake Grafton, just back from his harrowing, near-death experience in the Middle East, is struggling with his position in the Navy and with life in general.  He accepts a staff position at the Pentagon.  Fearing a bland, paper-pushing position, he finds himself as the head of a team charged with investigating and recommending a next-generation Navy fighter.  At the same time, the US is at the height of the cold war with the Soviet Union and espionage efforts are in full swing.  Coonts brings together a number of range of characters, while blending a number of sub-stories within the main story.  The book moves quickly, with frequent plot twists and uncertainty until the end about the position and motivation of a number of the book's characters.  If you are a fan of Coonts, it is worth going back for the Minotaur.	2002-10-25

Hornby describes the process of his physical, emotional, and intellectual growth in the context of his love for the game of football.  The detail and anecdotes are entertaining.  It was easy to wade through this work, and even though as a US Citizen my detail knowledge of the games, players and rivalries was minimal, simply being a fan of the game will keep you turning the pages..  As fate would have it, I read the book during a recent visit to the UK.  While there, I had the opportunity to watch two football matches in different London pubs.  The excitement was infectious and provided an added layer of enjoyment to Hornby's work	2002-10-16

The North &amp; South trilogy and the Bicentennial series were outstanding.  I had high hopes for Charleston but was left a bit disappointed.  If one is looking for a book that is primarily a history of Charleston, then this book is for you.  If on the other hand, you are looking for a great story that that just happens to be set in Charleston from the colonial period through the civil war (as I was), then this work by Jakes falls short.  The book covers many, many decades with a clear emphasis on historical fact rather than spinning a compelling tale.  It is far from a complete washout, but at the same time it is definitely not up there with his best works.	2002-10-16

I wish I new who she was so I could thank her, because The Associate was a great book  -- an absolute page turner.  Thankfully I had a six-hour plane ride that allowed me to read the book in one sitting.  The work is a cross between early John Grisham and early David Baldacci.  The book follows a young, hardworking attorney who stumbles into a series of events that quickly spin out of control as he fights for the truth and to save his life.  The Associate is packed with action, suspense, plot twists and good character development.  This was a great initiation to Margolin's work.  I will definitely be going back for more.	2002-10-04

Although Ghost Soldiers is a non-fiction work, it flows smoothly and is well written.  Many likely have a fleeting understanding or recognition of the Bataan Death March.  Very few people have an understanding of the lives of the US soldiers in the aftermath of the March.  Sides provides an excellent view of the brutal existence (both physical and emotional) of the prisoners during their years in captivity.  Intertwined with perspective of the prisoners, Sides tells the story of the newly-formed and untested Army Rangers outfit that will attempt to rescue the prisoners from their living hell.  Sides provides the reader with great insight into the tenaciousness, courage, perseverance, valor and honor of both the rescuers and the rescued.  This is a truly inspirational story.  It is a must read.	2002-10-04

I only wish that I had been able to finish it in 24 hours.  The book was extremely good.  In fact, it was nearly impossible to put down, continually tugging against work and family obligations.  The book grabs you in the first few pages and does not let go, with a storyline of kidnapping for ransom that hits right at every parents' worst nightmare.  The intensity and buildup of the story, combined with the ruthlessness of the villain make this a story that is not for the weak of heart.  However, as the story progresses, the character development lets the reader understand the egos, anxieties, and motivations of a broad set of characters -- and also drives the reader to form an affinity or antipathy for most characters.  It is a very compelling read.  I strongly recommend this book.	2002-08-29

With many of Brown's usual characters back again, there is a sense of familiarity for the fans of Brown's high-tech military thrillers.  At the core, the story itself had potential, playing on current Middle East tensions and moving through events that were at least plausible.  In the end, though, the story generally left me hoping for more.  The story bounced around continuously and somewhat unnecessarily, leaving gaps that left the reader wondering about the relevance of the passage.  In addition, the technical jargon on futuristic weapon systems seemed a bit much, even for readers who are used to such things from Brown.<br />Wings of Fire was not so disappointing as to cause me to turn away from future efforts from Brown, but it does leave me hoping that the works to come are better than this effort.	2002-08-20

Jack Ryan is just recently with the CIA and has been posted in London (where he is known as Sir John following the events chronicled in Patriot Games).  Ed and Mary Pat Foley have just been posted to Moscow where Ed Foley is the station chief for the CIA station in Moscow.  Ronald Reagan, although not mentioned by name, is President and the US is deep in the Cold War with the Soviet Union.  With that as the backdrop, Clancy spins an interesting tale of intrique, spycraft, human emotion and motivation, and ideological differences.  Although a bit predictable and too often repetitive, the story itself still moves along nicely  -- following the characters as they settle into their new environments and are thrust into a major geo-political, time-dependent situation that must be dealt with sooner than expected.  All in all, while clearly not Clancy's best, Red Rabbit is good enough to warrant your time.	2002-08-20

Both featured Lt Nathan Dixon, son of Scott Dixon who has been a main character in many of Coyle's previous books.  Although God's Children was published before Against All Enemies, the setting/timeframe of the former actually follows that of the latter, with references to Nathan Dixon's exploits in Against All Enemies referenced in God's Children.<br />With that as background, Coyle's followers will likely enjoy God's Children as well.  It is a fast read, in part because of the pace of the action and in part because the book is only 315 pages in hardcover.  In the story, NATO forces are on a peacekeeping mission in Eastern Europe.  First Lieutenant Dixon finds himself as an observer on the first mission of Second Lieutenant Reider, a newly-minted West Point graduate.  What is supposed to be a routine mission quickly deteriorates, with conflicting mission goals and rules of engagement adding to the confusion.  In order to survive, Dixon and Reider must work through their egos and the tension between them.  Coyle spends a substantial amount of time on the inner workings of the minds of Dixon and Reider.  The psychological, emotional, and physical pressures of leading men in battle in very adverse conditions is covered effectively.  My only real complaint was that the story seemed to end rather abruptly.<br />All in all, this is not Coyle's best, but it is a solid story and well worth your time.	2002-07-15

The story pits Kurt Austin and Joe Zavala against a group seeking to create political turmoil and unrest in Russia with a return of the Tsar.  The novel is filled with all of the action, suspense, and frequent plot twists that have become Cussler's trademark.  Like Serpent and Blue Gold, Fire Ice provides a broader character set from NUMA than the typical Dirk Pitt novel, with each character's personality adding to the depth and breadth of the story.  Although Austin and Zavala are at the center of the action, Austin has more of the top billing than in the previous two books.  The ongoing inclusion of crossover characters from the Pitt novels (i.e. Admiral Sandecker, Hiram Yeager) also adds substance.  All-in-all, the faithful followers of Clive Cussler will find Fire Ice to be an enjoyable summer read.	2002-07-15
US	50491732	R1ZETJBOIE6JZ4	076530239X	792846204	Against All Enemies	Books	4	7	7	N	N	You won't be disappointed	For those who have enjoyed the works of Harold Coyle, Against All Enemies is a solid story that will not be a disappointment.  Coyle sets the stage with a prelude that goes back to the period just before the Revolutionary War.  Moving to current times, Coyle presents a completely plausible story of an analogous quest for independence where events spin out of control, ultimately pitting Americans against Americans.  What stands out in this work from Coyle is his ability to portray the anxiety, turmoil and inner conflict experienced by the combatants of both sides as tensions escalate.  Written in 1996 but just published, Against All Enemies presents Lt. Nathan Dixon as he graduates from VMI and begins his active duty, along with characters from previous novels, Scott Dixon, Nancy Kozak, and Jan Fields.  All in all, this is a very strong effort from Coyle.  Although not as good as The Ten Thousand (which I consider to be Coyle's best work), Against All Enemies is solid and worth your time.	2002-07-09

Dorner covers the psychological and emotional failings that occur when individuals are faced with a myriad of complex systems.  Anyone who has been bitten by the law of unintended consequences will see a bit of himself in the pages as Dorner helps one envision the inherent inadequacies that prevent people from predicting and preparing for what becomes painfully obvious in hindsight.  Although a bit short on what to do in order to permanently correct the problems identified, simply bringing the pitfalls to light will go a long way to alleviate the problem.  This is a must read for managers and strategic planners......perhaps even on an annual basis.	2002-07-09

Having watched the HBO series when it first aired, I wanted to pick up the book to read coincident with the replay of the series on HBO.  I'm glad that I did.  I felt the series was excellent--truly visually compelling.  As most books do, however, the additional essence of what the men of Easy Company experienced from the first day of training to the end of the war in Europe could only be provided by the written word.  The additional depth and breadth of coverage in the book provided insights not available by simply watching the series.  Although not necessarily flowing smoothly like fiction normally does, Band Of Brothers was an easy, compelling read.  Whatever choppiness might exist can be forgiven as the reader gets more and more insight into the tenaciousness, courage, perseverance, valor and honor of the men of Easy Company.  This is truly a worthwhile read, regardless of whether or not the reader has seen the HBO series.	2002-06-03
US	50491732	RW335HW559IUW	0399145850	351280365	Day of Reckoning	Books	2	2	2	N	N	Underwhelming	Unlike most of the authors that I read, with Higgins I now pass on the first-run hardcover publication and wait for the paperback version or for the hardcover to hit the &quot;bargain book&quot; rack.  Higgins' early material is great, but, over the years, he has grown complacent.  The book is only 295 pages in hardcover, with very large margins, larger-than-average type face, and several blank filler pages between chapters.  I want a book that is a page turner because the story and action force the reader to blow through the book, not because the word count per page is so low (as is increasingly the case with Higgins).  The storyline (revenge) is good enough to warrant two stars, but it lacks depth.  Character development outside the recurring characters is minimal to non-existent.  Dialog is terse and choppy.  The book is not so much of a disappointment for what it is but rather for what it could have been.  If Higgins keeps this up, I will not only swear off the new hardcover versions but will take a pass on the paperback/bargain book versions as well.	2002-06-03

In fact, this is the first and only novel by DeMille that I have read.  So, unlike many of the reviewers who were disappointed with the book relative to other books by DeMille, I am left to judge Up Country on its own merits against my own expectations.  Against that criteria, I found Up Country to be entertaining, enjoyable and worth my time.  The novel follows Paul Brenner, retired military investigator, as he investigates the alleged murder of an American Lieutenant by another American officer in 1968 during the height of US involvement in Vietnam.  As the story unfolds, Brenner must confront the memories--and perhaps demons--of his past, which include two tours of duty in Vietnam, while using his intellect, inquisitiveness, and decisiveness to outwit the forces--both American and Vietnamese--lined up against him.  In the process, the reader is provided an in-depth look at present-day, post-war Vietnam, along with compare-and-contrast looks at wartime Vietnam.  All-in-all, I am very glad that I read this book.	2002-05-13

Daniel Silva provides the reader with his usual blend of action, excitement, intrigue, and plot twists -- all set within the historical context of the secret world of the Swiss banking system from WWII to the present.  In a reprise of Gabriel Allon, the art restorer and sometimes Israeli spy from the Kill Artist, Silva spins a tale of a secret Swiss society, long-ago collaboration with Nazi Germany, and a quest to recover art treasures plundered by the Nazi's in WWII.  Gabriel is drawn into the plot when he is sent to restore a painting belonging to an elderly Swiss banker.  Finding the banker dead, Gabriel is quickly forced to match wits with the mysterious English Assassin and members of the clandestine Swiss organization that seeks to keep the past of Switzerland buried.  This book is thoroughly entertaining.  A must read for fans of Silva's previous works.	2002-03-30
US	50491732	R16Y64CNM4W9YD	0385503822	782272714	The Summons	Books	3	8	8	N	N	Decent, but definitely far from great	With The Summons, Grisham is back with his traditional lawyer-based genre -- at least tangentially with judges and lawyers making up some of the main characters. A professor at the University of Virginia Law School and son of a legendary judge from a small town in Mississippi is summoned by his dying father to return to his hometown for a discussion of his last wishes. He arrives to find his father had already died and unexpectedly left behind three million dollars in cash. While the law and the courts provide a backdrop for the story, the professions of the characters are not necessarily essential to the story. In reality, this is a novel about life in the small-town South, strained family relationships, battles with drug and alcohol abuse, greed, and the intoxicating effect of large sums of money. Although plodding at times, the story is generally good enough to lead the reader to keep going. It is, however, not nearly as good as some of the vintage legal thrillers done by Grisham early in his career. Don't expect greatness with this book.	2002-03-18

On the one hand, the two main characters, NY City Detective Nat Hennessey and brilliant doctor Cush Walker are well developed. Each lost his father as a young boy, one in a racially motivated killing and the other probably so, at least tangentially. Each struggles in adulthood with his loss, with the deaths in large part driving who they have become. Tying them together is the brutality of their past and their love interest of the present. In actuality, all of this creates the potential for a great story line and a suspenseful novel. Where I struggle is with the depth of the experimental brain surgery throughout the book. Admittedly, given that this comes from the \\"medical thriller\\" genre, I should have been prepared for this. Not having read anything from Pottinger, I did not know what to expect and I found the medical experimentation threads to be a bit too weird for my liking. I kept turning the pages to see how things ended up, but I was left to wish that the underlying issues that I found to be intriguing -- race, bias, revenge, ego, and romance -- could have been pulled together in a different context.	2002-03-18

Mitch Rapp, Thomas Stansfield and Dr. Irene Kennedy are back in an edge-of-your-seat political thriller.  Having just read Transfer of Power, many of the characters in the Third Option were well known, with a storyline that flowed from the previous novel.  The only downside to reading them back to back was that some of the material was repetitive.  That said, the Third Option is another fast paced page turner.  The reader follows Mitch Rapp from an early attack on his life as he seeks to track down the conspirators.  If you liked Transfer of Power, you should also like The Third Option.  It will be difficult to put down.	2002-02-18

Transfer of Power was the first novel from Flynn that I've read, and having done so, I 'm wondering why I didn't do so sooner.  This book was outstanding!  Although the events of September 11th brought an added dimension to the story, this book would have been compelling anyway.  Flynn grabs the reader in the first few pages and doesn't let go.  Transfer of Power is very tight and fast paced, with plenty of action, suspense, and plot twists.  In the story, Arab terrorists have taken over the White House and hold the President hostage.  As self-serving and power hungry politicians worry as much or more about themselves than they do about thwarting the terrorists, it is up to the US military, special forces units, the FBI, the secret service and terrorist hunter extraordinaire Mitch Rapp to keep focused on the objective of thwarting the terrorists and freeing the President.  This book was almost impossible to put down. Now, on to Flynn's next work, The Third Option.	2002-02-18

The story is set in the UK and France during the period just prior to D-Day in WWII.  The Germans are in the middle of preparations for the massive Allied invasion that they know is inevitable.  The French resistance, supported by the Allies, is doing what it can to be disruptive in advance of the attack.  In the middle of it all is a group of British secret agents who are tasked with destroying a key communications exchange in northern France.  When the first plot is foiled, a more desperate plan based on an all-female attack team is launched.  Jackdaws is an impressive tale of espionage, with intense physical, emotional and intellectual battle being done among the combatants.  It is full of intrigue, twists, turns and surprises that are classic Follet.  The reader is presented with interesting characters and an entertaining, fast-paced story.  Jackdaws will be difficult to put down once you get started.	2002-01-25

Although it is not known how many additional finished or nearly finished transcripts exist, if any, following the death of Robert Ludlum, I was happy to have at least had the opportunity to enjoy the Sigma Protocol.  This latest work was really quite good and very difficult to put down.  This book grabs the reader early and does not let go, leading on more than one occasion to fits of yawning in the morning because I had stayed up too late reading the night before.  All in all, the Sigma Protocol provides all of the action, suspense, frequent plot twists, and unexpected events that Ludlum aficionados have come to love in the conspiracy-thriller genre.  This is clearly Ludlum's best effort in years.  My only hope is that there is another work of this quality from Ludlum in the pipeline.	2001-12-27
US	50491732	R45ZQK0ISY7MO	0446525804	472682750	Last Man Standing	Books	5	43	45	N	N	Excellent!!!!	Having taken a pass on Baldacci's departure from the action/thriller (Wish You Well), I welcomed a return to previous form with Last Man Standing.  I believe the latest effort was worth the wait.  Like his previous works such as Total Control and Absolute Power, Baldacci grabs you at the beginning of Last Man Standing and doesn't let go.  The work is another page turner, packed with action, suspense, plot twists and surprises.  In the story, the central character, Web London, is a member of FBI HRT (Hostage Rescue Team).  Previously decorated for heroism on many occasions, London finds himself inexplicably frozen during a rescue assault that wipes out the entire HRT assault team and leaves him as the last man standing.  As the story unfolds, London is left to deal with the aftermath of the situation and attempt to find an explanation.  Baldacci effectively utilizes shifts between the present and the past, and provides a broad character set to complement London's character.  All-in-all, Last Man Standing is a great read that marks a return to the genre in which Baldacci made his mark originally.  Hopefully, he will continue.	2001-11-20
US	50491732	R2LI9YX9DG6N0Q	0684863618	682610760	Pale Horse Coming	Books	5	43	45	N	N	Simply outstanding!	Pale Horse Coming is classic Stephen Hunter -- an epic battle of good versus evil, the limits of human endurance, courage under fire, loyalty, and of course, guns.  The story centers around two characters from Hunter's previous works -- Sam Vincent, gentleman lawyer, and Earl Swagger, WWII veteran and medal of honor winner.  On behalf of a client, Vincent journeys deep into the wilderness of Mississippi to check on the status of a prisoner at Thebes State Prison - the location where the worst of the worst &quot;colored&quot; offenders are sent.  Suspecting that he is walking into a dangerous situation, Vincent obtains the word of Swagger that he will come looking for Vincent if he does not return from Mississippi in a pre-specified duration.  Of course, Vincent walks into something that is beyond even his worst nightmares, thus engaging Swagger in his pledge to follow Vincent.  The story moves well, has lots of action, suspense, and frequent plot twists, while giving the author a forceful understanding of race relations in the deep South during the 1950's.  If you have liked Hunter's previous works, you will enjoy this as well.  It is a compelling page turner.	2001-11-14

The Quiet Game is the first novel by Greg Iles that I have read.  It will certainly not be the last!!  The Quiet Game was difficult to put down.  The story grabs the reader from the very beginning, with action, intrigue and frequent plot twists building as the story goes along.  In the story itself, lawyer and best-selling author Penn Cage retreats to his home in Natchez, Mississippi with his young daughter as they both struggle with the death of Cage's wife.  Quickly, the intended quiet and solace is turned upside down as Cage stumbles into the issues surrounding the decades-old death of a black man in Natchez.  As the story progresses, the character development lets the reader understand the egos, anxieties, and motivations of a broad set of characters -- and also drives the reader to form an affinity or antipathy for most characters.  The story gives the reader an interesting picture of the South, both today and as it was in the 1960's.  All-in-all, the Quiet Game will keep you guessing and turning the pages.  I strongly recommend the Quiet Game.	2001-10-17

With Finnegan's Week, Joseph Wambaugh has pulled together a very entertaining story.  The book follows a week in the life of aging police detective -- and aspiring actor -- Finn Finnegan as he works through two apparently unrelated crimes.  Finnegan's insecurities and quirks add spice to the story and mix well with the other characters.  All in all, Wambough has created a story that, although not terribly complex, is enjoyable to go through.	2001-09-28

It was a fast-paced, enjoyable read from the very beginning -- a true page turner that was difficult to put down.  The story was set in the UK prior to the invasion of Normandy on D-Day.  It was a time that the Allies truly needed to keep their plans secret and the Nazis desperately wanted to know the details of the inevitable invasion.  Hence a truly plausible story with a solid cast of characters -- some real and some fictional.  The story provides the reader with action, excitement, intrigue, and frequent plot twists.  Chances are that once you start his book, you will want to read it in big chunks.	2001-09-28

The faithful followers of Clive Cussler will find the book to be truly outstanding. Raising Valhalla is a classic Cussler story of good versus evil, with the usual predecessor event (in this case there are two seemingly unrelated such events -- the Vikings and Captain Nemo) setting the stage for an eventual tie-in to the main story. As would be expected, Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino again fight tremendous odds and calmly face down death repeatedly as they battle a demented, megalomaniac business man. Unlike some of the plots (and antagonists against whom Dirk and Al have done battle) in previous works, the underlying premise in Raising Valhalla does not push the envelope of ones imagination. The story is within the realm of believability. This is simply a very good novel filled with all of the action, suspense, and frequent plot twists that have become Cussler's trademark. In addition, after all of the action has been concluded, there is still a major surprise to be had in the last few pages. All-in-all, this book was a great read and very difficult to put down.	2001-08-27

Beep!, Bell and Harari provide the reader with an entertaining look at business practice and culture today.  In highlighting the behavior and actions of Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner, the authors provide a compare and contrast view of all facets of business and a unique perspective on how to be more competitive.  The message is simple and clear, capturing the spirit of what it takes to compete in the fast-paced, global marketplace.  (The book's preface is:  &quot;Road Runners don't have prefaces...they just begin!&quot;)  Although the boxes which describe actual scenes from the Road Runner cartoons get a bit redundant as the book moves along, the &quot;Birdseed&quot; and &quot;Tail Feathers&quot; sections that summarize most of the chapters were appropriate and welcome.  All-in-all, Beep! Beep! is a worthwhile read.  It can easily be consumed in an average plane ride (as I did).	2001-08-20

Having read the first three installments of the Harry Potter series aloud with my children, I was interested in the continuing exploits of Harry, Ron, Hermione and the rest of the gang at Hogwarts.  This time around, my kids decided to read the book on their own so I decided to go through it as well.  Despite the substantial length, it was generally a fast and easy, yet compelling, work.  Readers of the first three novels will be familiar with the style, the characters and the various storylines.  In The Goblet of Fire, Rowling tells another intriguing story of a year in the life of Harry Potter, with the usual twists, turns and intricacies that her readers have come to expect.  In this work, the plot -- although definitely more intense -- is build upon what preceded it.  The book clears up some of the mysterious unknowns from the previous books, thus pulling things together quite well in the end, while also setting the stage for the next installment.  All-in-all, the Goblet of Fire is a very good effort and is well worth the time&#8230;&#8230;even for an adult.	2001-08-20

This book should be enjoyable to those who have enjoyed other novels with the Mandriani character.  It is, however, on the short side, coming in at less than 300 pages versus the 450 pages indicated in advance of publication.  This book was originally supposed to be out in February so one is left to wonder what happened to it in the interim.  In general,  Martini has again pulled together an intriguing cast of characters and an interesting story line.  The story starts with the murder of a young, attractive, aggressive research scientist.  Paul Mandriani and his partner Harry find themselves defending a brilliant, yet aloof, research scientist who has been accused of the murder.  The sub-plots cover issues such genetic engineering, racial prejudice, and the politics of the research business.  As the book progresses, the reader is consistently treated to Mandriani's quick wit, sharp mind, and keen sense of reality in the world.  It is not too hard, however, to discover the killer's true identity before reaching the end of the book.	2001-07-13

The novel is set in the period following Brown's previous work, Fatal Terrain.  The premise itself of reunification of the Korean Peninsula was an interesting one that flowed naturally from the geopolitical and economic situation in place at the end of Fatal Terrain.  With many of Brown's usual characters back again, there is a sense of familiarity for the fans of Brown's high-tech military thrillers.  The setup for the story was well conceived and certainly held the reader's attention.  The only thing holding back a higher rating for Battle Born was the way the conclusion itself unfolded.....seemingly out of proportion to the build-up.  The ending seemed to happen all to quickly, leaving the reader with gaps in the resolution of certain characters which, if included, would have made for a more compelling work overall.	2001-07-05

With Vortex, I was not disappointed.  Vortex was a very strong effort, albeit not quite as good as Bond's Red Phoenix which was truly outstanding.  Bond presents another high-tech military thriller  -- in this case set in South Africa.  The storyline is entirely plausible, with a key event putting the country in turmoil and setting the stage for all of the fast and furious action that is to follow.  As in Bond's other works, character development is solid, diverse and believable.  The reader truly understands not only the emotional turmoil of battle, but also the underlying political issues of South Africa and the surrounding region.  If you like Bond or the military thriller in general, Vortex will be a worthwhile read.	2001-06-19

It was a true page turner - definitely difficult to put down.  The story provides action, excitement, intrigue and plot twists up to the very end.  Characters are developed throughout the book with effective inclusion of flashbacks.  The turmoil of the Middle East, the motivations of the parties involved, and the kill-or-be-killed emotional issues are brought forth effectively - helping to provide entertainment and intrigue at several levels.

As with Mills' previous efforts, the pace is fast, the action often intense, and the story line - while at times stretching believability - is intriguing.  Quinn Barry is a computer analyst working for the FBI but she has aspirations to be an FBI agent.  Through the course of her work, she uncovers evidence of a startling cover-up.  Quickly, she finds herself pursuing and being pursued by a brilliant but truly sadistic individual.  Barry and a surprising partner match wits with her pursuers as they struggle to solve the mystery and stay alive.  It should be noted that this work is not for the faint of heart.  From the very beginning, the descriptions are extremely graphic and the situations are grotesque and clearly unsettling.  Despite the graphic nature of the violence throughout the book, the story is definitely compelling enough to hold the reader's attention and keep the pages turning.	2001-05-18

As the book opens, Detective-Sergeant Malcolm Ainslie must meet with convicted serial killer Elroy Doil only hours prior to Doil's execution.  Their converstation sets the wheels in motion for the intriguing twists and turns that face Ainslie - challenging his analytical skills and personal character.  Hailey effectively uses flashback chapters throughout the book to set the context for current events, provide depth for the numerous characters, and to sew the seeds of numerous threads that come together at the end.  Having read Airport and Hotel many years ago, it has been quite a while since I had picked up a novel by Hailey.  Like those two novels, Detective was a compelling read.	2001-04-19

In Learning in Action, David Garvin lays out the concept of learning in a straightforward and easy-to-read manner.  He defines the process of learning and the types of learning, and then ties it together in coverage of the challenges organizations have in establishing a paradigm or continuous learning (which includes action).  While non-fiction is by its very nature often not the most exciting material in print, this book is able to keep the reader's attention through the use of real-life examples and a steady progression from the basics to the more complex.

It is a fast-paced, enjoyable read from the very beginning.  In the story, CIA agent Michael Osbourne finds himself pitted against a ruthless assassin with the code name \\"October.\\"  The battle is emotional, psychological and physical.  The supporting cast of characters are diverse and quite extensive.  While keeping track of the long character list is sometimes an effort, the total package provides a story with action, excitement, intrigue, and frequent plot twists.  Chances are that once you start his book, you will want to read it in big chunks.	2001-03-19
US	50491732	R3EBY9EW8PZ1UQ	031225346X	931904718	The Prometheus Deception	Books	5	3	4	N	N	A great last effort.............	Robert Ludlum is back!!!  The Prometheus Deception is an extremely good book - among Ludlum's very best - and one that was difficult to put down.  The true test of a novel is whether or not the reader, when faced with the choice between time spent sleeping versus reading, chooses to plow forward with the book late at night.  The latest from Ludlum will likely cause yawns in the morning due to late-night reading.  This book grabs the reader early and does not let go.  It features Nicholas Bryson as an ex-intelligence field operative who is brought out of retirement to infiltrate his former organization.  In the process, he is forced to face up to demons from his past, both professional and personal.  Bryson, while outwardly cool and confident, displays a full spectrum of personal emotions that simultaneously drive him forward and fill him with doubt.  All in all, the Prometheus Deception provides all of the action, suspense, frequent plot twists, and unexpected events that Ludlum aficionados have come to love in the spy-thriller genre.  This is Ludlum's best effort in years.  Unfortunately, his recent death will deprive fans of future work.  I recommend that you read this book -- the only down side will be missed sleep!!	2001-03-19

Having always enjoyed Grisham's novels, especially his early works, I was not sure what to expect from this effort.  I found it to be a pleasant and enjoyable novel.  A Painted House describes life on a cotton farm in (extremely) rural Arkansas during the 1950s.  As the story unfolds, harvest time is getting underway.  The trials and tribulations of life on the cotton farm almost 50 years ago are presented with stark clarity through the eyes of a 7 year old, Luke Chandler.  Luke's hopes and aspirations are brought fourth and played against the hardship and uncertainty facing the Chandler family year after year as cotton farmers.  Grisham provides a colorful, wide-ranging set of characters that add depth and intrigue throughout the story.  Although not a page turner with a gripping climax destined to keep one late into the night reading, all-in-all A Painted House is definitely worth a look.	2001-03-05

A good effort from Coyle......<br />All things considered, Trial by Fire was an enjoyable book.  I have read a number of Coyle's novels, some of which featured Lt. Nancy Kozak.  In Trial by Fire, I had the opportunity to go back to the introduction of Lt. Kozak.  The story was not as tight or compelling as some of Coyle's other works, but it was a solid work nonetheless.  The plot started quickly with the overthrow of the Mexican government and increased tension between Mexico and the US.  The rising anxieties, escalating conflict and troubled negotiations were certainly plausible.  For Coyle fans, this novel is worth the time.  I am glad that I went back to pick this up.	2001-02-19
US	50491732	RPMB1FOX7K4YS	0446359688	227289374	Red Phoenix	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Outstanding!!!!!	Having read and enjoyed two other novels by Bond, I decided to go back and give Red Phoenix a try.  I'm glad that I did.  Red Phoenix was truly outstanding  -- a high-tech military thriller presenting an extremely realistic portrayal of a new Korean war.  From the build-up preceding the action through to the exciting conclusion, the action is fast, furious, gut-wrenching, and intense.  Character development is solid, diverse and believable.  The reader truly understands the emotional turmoil impacting senior officers plotting strategy and soldiers on the battlefield.  Pick up and enjoy Red Phoenix.  Once started, it will be difficult to put down.	2001-02-19
US	50491732	R2MYOXTMCMJMST	0525945636	356134546	Code to Zero	Books	3	0	0	N	N	3 1/2 stars -- intriguing but not complicated	Follet sets this story on the eve of the launch of a U.S. rocket as the U.S. plays catch-up to Soviet Union.  The space race is heating up and the U.S. is struggling to stay in the game.  Code to Zero opens with a pair of apparently homeless bums waking up in the bathroom of a Washington DC train station.  The reader quickly learns that these two are not as they would appear at first glance.  One has lost his memory and does not know who he is or anything about his life.  The story unfolds with the amnesiac seeking to learn his identity, perplexed by his inability to recall anything from his past but seemingly able to react instinctively to increasingly precarious and dangerous circumstances.<br />While it does not take a rocket scientist to predict the outcome of the book, Follet nonetheless provides the reader with interesting characters and an entertaining, fast-moving story.  With the flashback chapters spread throughout the book, Follet has created an effective way to bring out the past of Dr. Lucas and provide the context for current events.  This is not Follet's best effort.  It is, however, well worth the time.	2001-01-22

It was engaging and enjoyable but not a pageturner.  Coughlin spins two parallel but unrelated stories through the book.  This leaves the reader to wonder if the two story lines will come together in the end or remain separate vehicles that develop the main character, Charles Sloan.  As the novel progresses in a somewhat meandering fashion, the reader comes to know Sloan, who is a lawyer of keen mind and thought process, a recovering alcoholic, and, at times, a tortured soul.  The story is able to hold the reader's attention but the ending is rather predictable.  The story is written in the first person perspective of Sloan, much like the Paul Mandriani novels from Steve Martini.  Personally, I will seek out a Martini novel before I again reach for Couglin.	2001-01-02
US	50491732	R2UZK5PK5OVEEI	0688149626	937357785	High Crimes	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Nearly impossible to put down!!	High Crimes was almost impossible to put down.  Thankfully I read this book over the Thanksgiving holiday, when some serious time could be allocated to relaxing and reading.  High Crimes is a fast-paced, enjoyable read from the very beginning.  There is action, excitement, intrigue, and frequent plot twists.  In the story itself, law professor Claire Chapman comes to defend her husband, Tom Chapman, against charges that he committed a military atrocity under a different identity while serving in the US Army.  Although some of the action is predictable, confusion, uncertainty, and surprise is the general rule, thus driving the reader to want to read \\"just one more chapter.\\"  I strongly recommend High Crimes.  It should prove to be an entertaining read.  The only downside is that it will be over all to quickly.	2000-12-12
US	50491732	RM54FJUZE4RGR	0440224608	501876974	Siberian Light	Books	2	3	7	N	N	Slow paced &quot;thriller&quot;	I started Siberian Light with great anticipation, hoping for a glimpse into the world of Siberia while moving through an entertaining story.  While Robin White provides a stark, apparently realistic view of a fairly dismal existence in present day Siberia, the story itself is unfortunately lacking a compelling reason to move quickly through the book.  Although billed as a \\"thriller,\\" this was not a \\"page turner\\" by any means.  The ingredients were there:  murder, corruption, political power struggles, evil business interests.  Unfortunately, Siberian Light seemed too often to simply plod along.  The main protagonist, Gregori Nowek, is an intriguing character, who, although admittedly having endured numerous difficulties in his life, seems to wallow in self pity so much that it slows the book down.  Through Nowek, the reader is meant to come to know and understand Siberia, so perhaps the dark side of Nowek is a necessity.  All-in-all, I wish that I had waited for this to come out in paperback instead of  buying the hardcover when first published.  If you want a look into the world of Siberia following the breakup of the Soviet Union, Siberian light will be worthwhile.  If you yearn for a true \\"thriller,\\" look elsewhere.	2000-12-12

While not a spectacular read, it was definitely worth the money.  The story itself puts ex-CIA assassin Kirk McGarvey in a situation where he must contemplate coming out of retirement due to a rapid deterioration of the political landscape in Russia and the seemingly irreversible rise of an evil leader of Russia.  Although the plot pushes the envelope of reality a bit, the story is nonetheless within the spectrum of believability.  McGarvey portrays a cool, confident, cerebral agent, yet also displays emotion sufficient to indicate that more than ice water runs through his veins.  I felt that the story moved along with a reasonable pace, with sufficient action and suspense.  All-in-all, even though this was not in the ranks of the best spy novels that I've read, there clearly is enough here to be of interest, and enough to make my pick up another of Hagberg's books.	2000-11-14

I am glad that I gave this work a shot, as it was a nice, entertaining read.  The story is about Ben Bradford, a Wall Street lawyer who, on the surface, seemingly has everything that anyone could want.  Quickly though, the reader comes to realize that, as the story goes, money cannot buy happiness.  In an instant, everything in Bradford's life is turned upside down.  Although it is difficult to condone what Bradford did, one cannot help but appreciate the workings of Bradford's mind as he plots his future and runs from his past.  The character development was quite good - it was easy to feel yourself in the various settings, rooting for or against various characters.  There was plenty of action, suspense and plot twists. This was a captivating book.  I will definitely seek out other works by Kennedy.	2000-10-28

With On Secret Service, an educational and often entertaining novel, Jakes has again spun a story of fiction, set against a backdrop of real-life characters and actual events.  Somehow though, the story was not as compelling as the North and South trilogy or the Bicentennial series that first drew me to Jakes.  It could have been the ratio of fact to fiction, which at times made this seem like non-fiction.  Also since the book covered the period from pre-war to post-war, there were often gaps of time where the reader is left wondering what was happening to the various characters.  This is not Jakes' best effort, but there is certainly more good than bad.  Reading On Secret Service will be worth the time, especially for civil war buffs.	2000-10-02

This is the third book from Martini that I have read and the second featuring Paul Mandriani - this novel is the best of the three.  Martini has spun an impressive legal thriller, with an intriguing cast of characters and plenty of action, suspense and plot twists.  The Judge is written from the perspective of Mandriani, a lawyer who somewhat reluctantly finds himself defending a judge he does not particularly care for.  As the book progresses, the reader is consistently treated to Mandriani's quick wit, sharp mind, and keen sense of reality in the world.  The Judge is a compelling novel that is hard to put down.  Read and enjoy!!!!!	2000-10-02
US	50491732	R3KQK194CEC5ZD	039914563X	225323965	The Bear and the Dragon	Books	4	0	2	N	N	A Solid Effort from Clancy	My guess is that those people who have enjoyed most of Clancy's previous  works will find that The Bear and the Dragon is classic Clancy - lots of  pages, a large number of characters to keep track of, voluminous technical  jargon on weapons systems, an evil government (and the leaders who run it)  to serve as the antagonist, a protagonist in Jack Ryan, and a good story.  While some find fault with the book due to one or more of these  characteristics, anything less would not be \\"a Clancy.\\"  The reprise of  Jack Ryan as the central character is welcome.  As the reluctant president,  he serves as an interesting contrast to the candidates in the current  election.  The story itself was well within the realm of possibility and  moved along quite well, despite the length.  It was truly an enjoyable and  worthwhile read.	2000-09-16

While I was initially drawn to the new series by Cussler and  Kemprecos as a way to quench my thirst for Cussler in between the Dirk Pitt  novels, the series starring Kurt Austin and Joe Zavala is clearly coming  into its own.  Blue Gold, the second installment in the series, is a  classic Cussler story of good versus evil.  An important event from the  past - in this case a downed airplane carrying a beautiful scientist with  an invention that will benefit mankind - sets the stage for the remainder  of a novel filled with all of the action, suspense, and frequent plot  twists that have become Cussler's trademark.  Like Serpent, Blue Gold  provides a broader character set from NUMA that the typical Dirk Pitt  novel, with each character's personality adding to the depth and breadth of  the story.  The ongoing inclusion of crossover characters from the Pitt  novels (i.e. Admiral Sandecker, Hiram Yeager) also adds substance.  All-in-all, this book was a great read and very difficult to put down.  The  only downside was that, given that the book was under 400 pages, the  enjoyment was over all too quickly.	2000-08-18

Free Fall,  however, is clearly Mills' best effort to date - very tight and fast paced.  Free Fall is a page turner - with plenty of action, suspense, and plot  twists.  Mark Beamon, suspended from the FBI in the aftermath of his  actions in the previous book (Storming Heaven), finds himself again as a  bit of a lost soul battling his physical and emotional insecurities as he  searches for the truth in this political action/thriller.  Beamon, although  a thorn in the FBI's side due to his maverick tenancies, again demonstrates  the mental skills, perseverance, and apolitical perspective that make him  the FBI's go-to guy.  This book is clearly capable of standing on its own.  Part of my enjoyment of this story, however, was the history that I had  built up with Beamon in &quot;Rising Phoenix&quot; and &quot;Storming  Heaven.&quot;  If you enjoyed the previous work, you will no doubt enjoy  &quot;Free Fall.&quot;  In you have not read the others, you might want to  consider taking these books in order.	2000-08-04

At the end of each chapter, I would convince myself that I could read &quot;just one more chapter.&quot;  It  cost me some sleep but I was able to go through large chunks of the book in  a sitting.  Although not as good as Total Control, which I think was  Baldacci's best effort, Absolute Power was still a page turner.  Having  seen the movie years ago, I was a bit skeptical to pick up the book but I  am glad that I did.  Although Baldacci has obviously tightened up his  writing skills with his subsequent novels, Absolute Power is still packed  with action, suspense, plot twists and good character development.  I  quickly found myself rooting for Luther Whitney, who although a career  thief also has an abundance of courage, integrity and personal fortitude.  If you are a Baldacci fan  but have not yet read his first work, I strongly  recommend picking up Absolute Power.	2000-07-27
US	50491732	R3GMXAJR3VNKY7	068486360X	125490883	Hot Springs	Books	4	21	22	N	N	A welcome prequel	Having read and thoroughly enjoyed the three &quot;Bob the Nailer&quot; offerings from Hunter, I looked forward to this novel whose central character is Earl Swagger -- WWII veteran, medal of honor winner, tortured  soul, and father to Bob the Nailer.  Although not as good as Point of  Impact (which was an impressive page turner), Hot Springs did not  disappoint.  Early morning workouts on the stepper or exercise bike were  not seen as drudgery but rather as an opportunity to pound out more pages  of Hot Springs.  Throughout the book, one comes to know and further  appreciate the intricacies, both positive and negative, of being a Swagger.  Action sequences and character development are interwoven and provide a  complementary blend throughout the book.  This novel is able to stand on  its own as an action/thriller, but for those who have already completed the  &quot;Bob the Nailer&quot; books, it also offers a good early glimpse at  characters from previous novels and ties together events that are littered  throughout those efforts.  Certainly, this will not be the last novel from  Hunter based on the Swagger clan.	2000-07-25
