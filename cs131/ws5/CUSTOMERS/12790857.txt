From time to time since 1970, various paperback publishers have tried to rival the Mack Bolan phenomenon with other men's adventure series.  Signet published several over the course of the years.  Although their attempts were different and, as a whole, very good, none of their series lasted much more than a dozen or so books.   The Specialist is a very good try from the 80s.  A soldier of fortune, Jack Sullivan, is hired to track a former African dictator who is relaxing in France. Not the typical Bolan clone.	2005-08-24

Along the way they befriend a native tribe and battle the usual assortment of creatures and shamans.  Roland Green did a good job with the jungle portions of Conan at the Demon's Gate and his skill with the genre makes me wish for a little Tarzan pastiche out of him.  The battle with the Golden Serpent is one of the best Conan vs giant serpent encounters ever.	2005-08-23

It moves to the time after the death of Belit when Conan wanders the Black Kingdoms and encounters the Bamula tribe.  The initial jungle adventure is done well and I was reminded of Burroughs early tales of Tarzan.  However, after this promising start, Green moves the story and all of its characters to Pictland where a Pictish wizard is working on the task of animating a statue of an ancient warrior.  REH and his pastichers have done the animated statue several times and this adads nothing new to the mix.  In a ridiculous plot thread which explains the transportation of Conan and the Bamulas, the statue can be animated by the blood of a loved one ... or 20 total strangers.  <br />Green is and excelent fantasy author but this Conan adventure falls short.	2005-08-15

I love Lin Carter's fantasy work.  Thongor is the best of the Conan knockoffs (but I don't consider Elric or Fafhrd/Mouser to be Conan clones) and his other takes on genre favorites are usually dead on.  But the stories here are the same thing over and over again.  You get the usual litany of Lovecraftian gods and books in every story.  There is the same plot of a strange inheritance that brings doom in almost every story.  And you get the italics to denote horror ad nauseum.  I like Cthulhu stories with slight differences or updating.  Clark AShton Smith could do it.  Ramsey Campell managed to do it after his early slavish imitations, but Carter never got out of the groove.  The best Carter story is a short tale telling the usual barbarian vs. evil sorceror tale from the sorceror's side.  Other than that, these stories should have been seeded one at a time in other Chaosium books in order to curb the sameness.	2005-08-10

Bova gives us a great story touching on all aspects of the mission-technical, political, personal.  And none of these aspects overwhelms the story to the point where it is too political, etc.  The narrative moves back and forth in time, scattering the story of the training, liftoff, flight and lives of the spacefarers throughout the story of their actual time on Mars.  Bova shows a skill in handling narrative that makes the book a quick satisfying read even at 500 pages.  There are no loose ends, no excessive wordage just one hell of a story. <br />  My only quibble with the story is minor.  A male astronaut who hits on all of the women is deemed unacceptable and cut from the mission, but a man-hungry woman bent on bedding every man in the group is kept.  Added to that, she has an intense hatred of Russians who are in command of some aspects of the mission.  How did she make it through the psycholgical screening?	2005-08-10

Carter and DeCamp find a way to maintain the suspense even though any Conan fan knows the outcome of the story.   The story shifts between Conan's inexorable march to Aquilonia and Thuu's attempts to stop the rebel army.  Numedides is an excellent character, nasty and pitiful at the same time, every character in the book knows what's going on except him.	2005-08-07

In this story, the early adulthod of Seldon is revealed as he sets out on the path that will lead to his refinement of his psychohistory system.  Asimov brings in several recurring themes from his books to unite the works.  We see the legend of a mythical homeworld of humanity, the stories of robots and the myth of a unique long-lived robot dedicated to protecting humanity.  All are linked with Seldon in this masterful story.  He shows his ability to create a world of various cultures in Trantor.

Captured by the Hyrkanian tribes, he battles his way to a spot in the army of Bartatua, would-be ruler of the world.  Betrayed by Lakhme, one of the nastiest females in the Conan saga, he finds himself trying to rescue the city he has just laid siege to.  He also finds himself helping an annoying poet rescue the city's princess. The book has some nice touches.  One moment that struck me, and it was only one line, was when oil drenched corpses are used to light the work site for a siege ramp.  Surprisingly for a Conan story, there is no girl for the barbarian and the sorcery (with monster)is compressed into just 3 pages.  In addition, though I often find the secondary characters in a Conan pastiche to be forgettable, Roberts creates several characters who merit stories of their own. Lakhme, Manzur the poet, Bartatua, Conan's friend Rustuf are all characters I would like to see again.  It's a different kind of Conan story but a superior pastiche.	2005-08-07

Howard are of any worth.  Sure he's the best but there have been other works of merit under the Conan aegis. Leonard Carpenter wrote one of my favorite non-Howard Conan's with \\"Conan Lord of the Black River\\".  Here, Carpenter slips a little.  Granted we get the rare treat of one of Conan's wenches from a previous story returning and playing a major role in a second, but some of the goings-on in this one are a stretch.  During a project to come up with a naval weapon capable of defeating the pirates, a wizard stumbles on the steam engine.  The silliness  took away a bit from the story. And one wonders why Conan stuck with the crew of whiners that seemed to mutiny every time he turned around.  On the plus side, we see Yildiz and Yezdigerd, 2 implacable foes of Conan during the series, trying to come up with a new idea for besting him.  Mysterious centipede creatures and a sorceror's unique use for them add a bit of horror.  Fair non Howard Conan, better than some but not as good as others.	2005-08-07

These stories of quiet SF horror were penned by, among others, JG Ballard, John Christopher and John Wyndham.  The formula involved some type of ecological disaster, sometimes tied to alien invasion.  Many of the better stories were told from the fringes of the disaster showing the common man involved in the changes.  Kraken Wakes is a marine version of Waar of the Worlds, with objects falling into the ocean and sea tanks coming ashore to facilitate the invasion.  The invaders also begin to melt the ice caps to raise the ocean level, flooding the earth.  The aliens are never seen andf most of the novel is given to the reaction of several characters caught up in the changes.  No whizbang pyrotechnics here, just the quiet horror of slow change which sems unstoppable.	2005-08-07

Well, I bought a German course for my computer and have started ordering the originals from Europe.  This book introduces the most prolific science fiction series of all time.  When the first US rocket lands on the moon, the astronauts find a crew of Arkonides marooned on the dark side.  Perry Rhodan, the commander of the US ship, offers to help them in exchange for technology and embarks on a plan to bring the earth up to the level of the Arkonides.   <br />From this book, 2500+ adventures were launched in Germany.  The series encompasses a pulp style weekly, comic books, paperbacks and dozens of other products and publications.   <br />About 150 of the novels were published in the US including several books containing 2 stories and about 20 or so published by a now-defunct small publisher.  In those available in the English, you'll find such pulp-SF staples as aliens, robot brains that rule entire empires, atomic mutants (from before the X-Men craze), survivors of Atlantis, and a dinosaur infested Venus.  Perry's succession of giant spaceships is amazing. <br />Warning-prepare to be addicted to the series after the 1st several books.  My one gripe with the English version is the prevalence of very bad puns inserted by editor Forrest Ackerman.  They don't appear in the first few books but become a nuisance after that.  <br />Give it a try.	2005-08-05

Re-reading it now, I find a lost world story with a difference.  The beings who evolve individually over days (rather than the gradual evolution of centuries) are a unique concept in the sf/fantasy genre.

I snap up a bunch of Ace forty cent-ers so I can replace some of my 70s re-issues.  Gotta have them Frazetta covers.  Deep in the box are 'the other novels'.  Not Tarzans or John Carters.  These are the stuff from the early years, \\"Efficiency Expert\\", \\"Girl from Farris\\" and the like.  Never read them but at 20cents each, what the heck.  One of them is \\"The Bandit of Hell's Bend\\".  I know from reading his Apache novels that ERB can write good westerns. But Bandit of Hell's Bend isn't one of them.  Written in the mid-20s, it is too melodramatic for modern readers.  The characters spout bad western (and in one case, Chinese) dialect.  One character is a poetry spouting cowboy who recites the worst poetry known to man.  It's just plain lousy, but since I have to have a complete collection...

But this edition of Chaosium's series is better than most.   As usual, you get the pre-Lovecraft influences in a trio of ghost stories.  I enjoy these late-19th/early 20th century curiosities.  I intend to look for more of these gems in other anthologies.  Ramsey Campbell's \\"Moon Lens\\" is out and out imitation Lovecraft.  But if you didn't like tales Lovecraftian, why would you buy this?  Richard Tierney's Simon of Ghitta stories are Lovecraft meets Sword and Sorcery and \\"Seed of the Star-God\\" is one of the best in the book.  Again, this story has put Chaosium's collection of Tierney's stories high on my 'must read' list.  There are several stories that show how the Lovecraft mythos can be used to inspire other stories (Harold's Blues, Grossie) without resorting to the ancient monsters.  And others, like Will Murray's entry that take the usual Cthulhoid creatures in new directions.  Robert Price's introduction and story notes are, as always, thought-provoking and informative.   Here's hoping that Chaosium and Price don't run out of stories too soon.	2005-08-04

This is set in the near future where things have changed from what we know (global warming has happened, nanotechnology) but not enough to make it unrecognizable or far-fetched.  The story involves the decision to start mining the asteroid fields in order to replace earth's deplenished resources.
