LADIES IN WAITING is the compelling story of four very different women from diverse lifestyles and backgrounds, all waiting for their men to get out of prison.  These women, a preacher's wife, a stockbroker's wife, a baby mama, and a single cutie, meet, share their stories and their friendship.  Each is able to learn and glean from the others.  The book illustrates them making horrendous sacrifices just to make their weekly visit to see the brother, spend some time with him and (in some cases) give him their hard earned money for his necessities.  LAIDIES IN WATING also displays a view from within the prison, one with physical violence and sexual abuse.   It goes even further to show how inmates fake caring in relationships, run scams and control the women.  This is an interesting and very believable book.  Highly recommended.	2003-08-20

In CHOSEN PREY, average-looking Professor James Qatar appreciates the finer things that life offers, such as art, history, designer clothes, photography, and beautiful, blond women.  Unfortunately, for most of the women with whom he becomes involved, his ultimate goal is to kill them.<br />As woman after woman is reported missing in a large metropolitan area, and then one is found murdered, the police begin to connect the disappearances.  Head honcho for the case is Investigator Lucas Davenport, who quickly becomes consumed with finding this maniacal average Joe.  Davenport's task seems almost impossible because it appears that the killer is able to be invisible in plain sight and he's leaving amazingly few clues. <br />This is a real page-turner, done in the style of the James Patterson novel, where the reader knows the killer's identity from the beginning.  The drama and suspense come with each missed opportunity and the potential for further mayhem.	2003-08-20

It appears even criminal to Sir Hugh of Beaucaire, who believes some of her acquired wealth, actually should be his.  And it appears a gift horse of opportunity to the greedy and powerful people who can accuse Guinevere of murder, execute her, and then take her lands.<br />Hugh, a principled man of high standards, is sent by the King and his chief advisor, the Privy Seal, to investigate the unusual circumstances of Guinevere's many widowhoods.  In addition to looking into the manner of her husband's deaths, he's to fetch her before the court for review.<br />Before meeting Guinevere, Hugh naturally assumes her guilt, but he's not prepared for her honor, intelligence, beauty and wit.  She is his equal in all ways.  He's also not prepared for how he's drawn to her, and then to her children.<br />Having completed his investigation, Hugh and Guinevere begin the journey to London, a trip which has it's own pitfalls.  However, nothing can make Guinevere ready for the terrifying court session before the king and the Privy Seal.<br />THE WIDOW'S KISS was much more suspenseful than the average romance novel.  It's a real page- turner.  I also appreciated the length, which was necessary to pull all of the wide-ranging parts and characters together.  This book is excellent and comes highly recommended!	2003-02-25

It shows how following a path set for us by others or one that we trod, without benefit of wise counsel, can both be disastrous.<br />Lady Cassandra Abbott wants to be the proper English lady.  She follows the advice of her mother.  She assists her father wherever possible.  She even writes a ladies' etiquette handbook for other young ladies.  Much to her detriment, she marries a rich old man, as planned by her parents.  The marriage turns out to be disastrous.  Her husband has no love.  He's abusive and stingy.  When he dies, he leaves her penniless.  At this time, Cassandra comes to the conclusion that being proper may have been a mistake.  She should have been more independent and carefree.<br />Lord Bryce Keene wants to ignore society's rules.  He gaily flits from one affair to the next, but settles on and marries an exciting, exotic beauty.  His wife soon tires of him and openly flaunts her infidelities with other men.

Bryce finds out Cassandra's circumstances, makes an offer and draws up a contract.  Cassandra makes fifty-six provisions to the contract and accepts.  The highlights of this book are the provisions, how they're revealed and executed.  The time taken to work their relationship out lets these two people get to know, appreciate and love each other.<br />The author lends tremendous insight into the revelation of having made bad choices and the willingness to start over.  In addition to being humorous, it's a sensuous love story.  It's agood romance novel.	2002-07-17

It's a complicated and intertwining love story, but it's not even close to the standard romance fare.<br />SUZANNE'S DIARY FOR NICHOLAS is two parallel stories from two women involving their love for the same man and for the child that each has with him.  This novel lets you feel the full range of emotions, from giddy joy to anger, to jealously, to the depths of despair and hopelessness.  It also makes you feel the love and compassion that people have for one another.<br />In addition to being a wonderfully written book, Patterson draws vivid verbal descriptions of places, so much so that it's easy to visualized being there.  He also uses timely and real referenceS to current events, which make the story \\"right now\\" relevant.<br />What's even more delightful about this book is that the author's practice of mystery writing is very much alive.  You can't predict the ending.  And it is more than well worth the wait.<br />I truly enjoyed reading SUZANNE'S DIARY FOR NICHOLAS and would recommend it highly to others.	2002-06-26

B-MORE CAREFUL is written in the style of Teri Woods' earlier novel, THE NAME OF THE GAME.  The similarities are immediately obvious, and her editing hand is definitely in it.  This book is fast-paced, street-smart, hip-hop and ghetto fabulous.<br />The story takes place in Baltimore (B-More) and centers around the illegal drug trade, its established hustlers, its wannabes and the women (pussy pound) who cling to the drug lords for the notoriety and the easy money.<br />B-MORE CAREFUL attempts to show the glamorous side of the drug crime life through the eyes of the ghetto woman by the putting emphasis on flashy jewelry, designer clothes, expensive cars and exciting nightlife.  For the most part, this book dwells on the benefits of material things.  It highlights greed, envy, jealousy and revenge.  It almost totally avoids emotions such as love and commitment.<br />This novel deserves credit for showing the gritty side of crime, the constant disloyalties, murders, and the ensuing prison sentences.  To that end, the author does not spare the reader.<br />Summarily, the language was coarse and limited and the book truly needed a professional editor.  Otherwise, it was a good book.  Shannon Holmes has a writing future.	2002-06-19

This book looks at how people view different religions and how they justify their own beliefs.  It also looks at having a friend/mentor who may not be what he seems.<br />This is a strange book written in a beautiful, poetic style, yet it had no main, continuing plot.  Several portions were written out of order for effect like the relationship between father and son, then the effects of missing a scheduled flight; yet they seemed more to confuse issues than to illuminate them.  And the ending (writing from the dead zone) appeared to attempt for a science fiction rating. <br />If I could, I'd give SATISFY MY SOUL a 5 for beautiful phrases and mental pictures, but a 2 for story line and content.  Somewhere along the road, in planning or in execution, the story got lost.  Generally, I absolutely love this author's work.  In this case, was looking for something equal to or better than Channer's first novel, WAITING IN VAIN, but I didn't find it here.	2002-06-13

In this book, the father accidentally kills the mother while he's in a drunken rage.  To make matters worse, all three children witness the slaying.<br />Throughout their lives, each child suffers in his own way.  The oldest feels guilt because she couldn't stop the killing, and responsibility for her siblings simply because she's the oldest.  The second child, a son, appears to inherit his father's lack of self-control, and goes through life missing promising opportunities.  The youngest, having no other way to cope, simply closes her mind down and lives in a child like state.<br />As the years pass, their father tries to stay in contact, and when he's released from prison, he makes the effort to mend fences with his children.  Each child reacts differently.<br />MY BROTHER'S KEEPER is an emotional book and a real tearjerker.  It truly pulls at the heartstrings.  Overall, it's a good book.  Yet, the ending was confusing and less than satisfactory.  Also, the picture on the cover doesn't represent the people in the story.	2002-05-14

She delves into her past, her relationship with her husband, and just how she came to be ADDICTED.  This book also looks at some of the possible negative outcomes for one involved in adulterous behavior.<br />As I neared the end of ADDICTED, the reading became more intense and I found it harder to put down.  Zane writes erotica well, but she may be an even better mystery and suspense writer.<br />Overall, this was a good book.  I found some of the dialogue juvenile.  The reason for addiction did not seem realistic. Also, while there may have been some times when use of profanity made a point, there were too many times when it was overused.	2002-05-14

He leaves his comfortable world of legal thrillers and unforseeable endings to venture into a area which appears to be somewhat autobiograhical.<br />This story tells the events on one family's farm during the 1952 cotton-harvesting season in rural Arkansas.  It is told as seen through the eyes of a seven-year old boy, Luke Chandler, a young man much too country-old for his few years.<br />This harvest season brings with it a cast of characters who can only be deemed &quot;out-of-the-ordinary&quot; misfits.  Specifically, there are the hired helpers, the Spruills and the Mexicans.  The Spruills have Tally, a sexy teenage siren, Trot, a gentle handicapped youngster and Hank, the overdeveloped out-of-control bully.  The Mexicans are a peaceful and ordinary lot, with the exception of Cowboy, a knife wielding enigma.  It's destinied that Hank and Cowboy will meet on not too friendly ground.<br />In A PAINTED HOUSE, Grisham builds his characters and develops scenes to the point where this is a real page-turner.

Ms. Starr is able to convey all of those emotions extremely well.  We find ourselves rooting for Vanessa and Scott.<br />Yet as their love develops, so do the obstacles of other people's prejudice, some well-meaning and some not.

THUNDERLAND is the story of a teenager, his family and friends, in which a childhood imaginary friend escapes the brain and becomes a living, breathing, havoc-wrecking nightmare.<br />The author, Brandon Massey is extremely descriptive and it was easy to &quot;see&quot;, &quot;hear&quot; and &quot;feel&quot; the THUNDERLAND storm, in all of its ferocity.  He also writes that little something extra which lets the story give you the jitters when you're alone.<br />Massey shows a new slant into the development and sustaining of a science-fiction horror entity.  It's a different way of looking at one of the unexplained tricks of the mind.  At certain points in THUNDERLAND, the book was juvenile, and just a little too far out, but overall, it's a good book.  I recommend it for those who like science-fiction.	2001-11-19

She showed hustlers as heroes and their women as &quot;paper&quot; starved boy-toys who would do anything to be a part of the life.<BR>There was far too much emphasis on the money and far too little on what drugs do to a community and to society.

Then he questions why main stream America doesn't want to accept him with open arms.<br />It's amazing that through all of his wrongs, this book offers no hint of shame or repentance.  He's not the epitome of &quot;a young black man in America&quot;.  He's an ex lowlife who doesn't know it.  He's the kind of person that's easy to hate.<br />But because of his honesty in his subject matter and his excellent writing ability, I think this book is a masterpiece.

It's the book where Dickey did his biggest writing stretch and it really pays off.<br />This is the story of Jordan, a young Black New Yorker, with a Southern upbringing, who's trying to get out of a relationship that didn't work; a relationship that may have left the gift that keeps on taking.  It's also the story of Kimberly, a young, White New Yorker, who's a striving artist.  These two people acknowledge an instant attraction and begin an intimate relationship.  Their biracial companionship causes problems for them by the general public, their friends and ex's.<br />The minor players who contribute to the mayhem are Jordan's ex-girlfrend and his best friend.  <br />The ending to MILK IN MY COFFER is surprising, well thought-out and-well written.

These intertwining relationships cause tempers to flare, accusations to be made and justice to be sought. <br />That's about all one can write without starting to give away the plot which is well hidden, thickened and spiraled. LORD OF THE MIST is is an excellent &quot;can't-put-it-down&quot; book.	2001-07-25

However, Behrani has legally purchased the home and won't sell it to the county or anyone else for less than triple profit.<br />HOUSE OF SAND AND STONE shows how a person's history and heritage control their thinking regarding their property.

She refuses proposal after proposal by some of society's finest.  Her spurned suitors, members of an &quot;underground&quot; club, think she needs to be taught a lesson in submission by the &quot;Master.&quot;  Little do they know that Lucenda is more ready for the erotic lessons than even the Master.<br />Story Two is RISKING IT ALL by Susan Johnson.

The murder scenes are described in graphic detail.  The case is solved fairly easily, but just when the reader is thinking that it was too easy, and not enough suspense, Patterson opens a whole other venue of mystery and suspense.  <br />There are also health issues with the main character and a beautiful love story going on in the backgroud.<br />The only unbelievable part of this book was how fast the women developed friendships and how trusting they were of each other's loyalty to their group.  In reality, women tend to be more proprietary and suspicious of each other, particularly when their fields are competitive.<br />I hope that 1st TO DIE is the first in a series with the Women's Murder Club.

Hilton James, a married father of two, thinks something is wrong with him because he can't distinguish what's really happening to him and what he's imagining.  As the story unfolds, the reader wonders if Hilton is really alive of did he drown as a child, yet somehow manage to maintain a body.  Also, he appears to be stalked by a man born on the same date as himself.<br />THE BETWEEN is hard to figure out.  It's a must-read for those who believe in the para normal and the out of body experiences.  It's listed in the &quot;horror&quot; category, but that label is too strong.<br />The only negative thing about the this book was the short chapters.  It wasn't a large book, yet some of the chapters were only one page and I didn't see the distinction when changing from some of the chapters to the next.	2001-05-09

Pat Conroy's writing style immediately identifies him as a master at his craft.  This is an emotional work and it is for the person who enjoys feeling the full range of emotions (joy, anger, helplessnes, etc.) while reading a book.  <br />This book covers life in the McCall family, where the father is an embarrasing alcoholic, a brother has volatile, and sometimes comical instances of mental instability, and the mother is regal, despite all.  BEACH MUSIC also goes outside of the family where there is parental abuse, accidental death, protection of a friend, and betrayal by another friend.  There are many little subplots going on throughout the book, which all come together to form a marred, but realistic portrayal of family, friends and love.  <br />The main characters are extremely well-developed, particularly that of the mother, whose history I found to be the most heartwrenching.  <br />The majority of BEACH MUSIC takes place in costal South Carolina, but some action occurs in Rome, Italy.  In both of these places, the scenes are so vividly described that it feels like the reader is actually there.  <br />If you like to feel your emotions raging, this is THE book for you.  Pat Controy may prove to be one of the best writers of our time.	2001-03-28

Her characters are so real, their emotions so poignant, that you feel their joy, their indecision and their heartache.  In this book, an unfulfilled Black artist meets a White cop, when he's down and out.  After getting to know each other, they like each other, but they have to face family, co-workers and friends who are determined to give them every reason why the relationship won't work.  After not dealing with their issues head-on, they agree.  It's loneliness without each other that makes them come back together.  In the end, they decide, based on their own feelings, the direction they want to go.  The supporting cast, whether good or bad, in the book are excellent.  THE COLOR OF LOVE is highly recommended as a good, realistic romance and as a way to see around prejudice.	2001-03-26

The final plus is that if the directions are followed to the letter, the dessert comes out perfectly.  These sweets range from assorted cakes and breads to biscotti and cookies.

Of course, he can't tell her the truth about himself, but it comes out in a painfully embarrassing way.  From that point on, Malcolm sets about to gain redemption.

Finally, FLIGHT OF THE BLACKBIRD looks at the impact of having less on family pride, values and images.  Even though this book presented a very real scenario and I'm glad I read it, it was depressing.  One bad situation kept happening after another.

She captures the essence of a family disintegrating and reuniting.  This book is about the separate and united lives of the Price family, the separated, middle-aged parents and their four very different, adult children. By the author's letting each member speak in the first-person voice, in alternating chapters, it was easy for the reader to visualize and understand the each family member's personal reasoning for their own circumstannce.  Each sibling's problems, squabbles, heartaches, and triumphs are discussed in detail.  It was also easy to either identify with a character or recognize someone who did.  This is a well-written, emotional and realistic story about the trials and joys of one slightly disorganzed family.  The Family Tree inside the cover was a real plus.  It helped to place and follow who belonged to whom.	2001-03-19

I's the story of Evangeline aka Eve, who was kidnapped along with her father and forced to spy on her deceased cousin's widower - for the life of her father.  She was given a plausible ruse as a recent widow with no funds, but she hadn't counted on her cousin's widower, Richard Clarenden, his handsomeness, his wit, his generosity or his well-known sexual prowess.  As their feelings for one another deepen, it becomes clear that Eve's false portrayal is failing and that those she cares most about are in grave peril.  This book also delves into the lengths of criminal activity and treason those in high levels of power will go to achieve their end. THE DECEPTION is well written and intense.	2001-03-07

It's shrouded in mystery and unfolds slowy to come into a shattering focus.  Old loves are not what they seem.  Something sinister is going on.  Who can one trust.  The heroine, a virginal Francesca, takes on the role of her recently-deceased friend, Samara, an exotic dancer who made men swoon at her feet.  But this deception brings Francesca confinement, humiliation, and betrayal.  This book shows less erotic adventures than usual for Ms. Devine, a master of the erotic.  It isn't her best work, yet I couldn't put it down until I saw how it ended.  As always, this author's style twists and turns can't be anticipated.	2001-03-07

Years later, her diary, plus archived news reports and a great writing style combined to produce this searing expose.  It is the story of the 1957-1958 integration attempt at Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, as seen through the eyes of a participant, one of the Little Rock Nine, Melba Patttilo Beals.  <br />In WARRIORS DON'T CRY, it's heartwrenching to read of the actual daily brutality and torture of kicks, slaps , spitting, sprays and verbal abuse that these children suffered.  The events that occurred at this timne made an unerasable mark of violent racist psyche on the multi-colored design that composes America's people.  This book is also emotional because it is easy to see that those in power could have made the transition to integration a much smoother and less painful step into an inevitably better social structure.<br />This was a hard read.  I had to put it down several times because the visualization was just too intense, the bigotry and viciousness too unadulterated.  Yet, I think it's something every American needs to read so that the actions contained in this book will never be repeated.	2001-02-20

Unbeknownst to her, her special powers summon up Herman, a man perfect in every way, except one ... he's a ghost.

One day, Alice, the main character and an admitted misfit, daydreams for a few minutes while babysitting her neighbor's children, and one of the chidren drowns due to Alice's inattention.  Of course, Alice feels responsable, but as her heartache grows, so does the townpeople's anger at her.  Working as a nurse at a local school, the parents begin to falsely accuse her of molesting their children.  Alice is then arrested, sent to jail to endure a different kind of horror.  Meanwhile, her husband, Howard, is forced to sell their dairy farm to pay her legal fees.  Eventually, she is released and they move away.  My heart was sad for the mother of the child who died and I can only imagine the mental anguish a responsible person would feel, but I don't think this was a really good book.  I found the only redeeming quality in A MAP OF THE WORLD to be that Theresa, the mother of the drowned child, was able, after a time, to forgive and move on.	2001-02-14

If you think, from the title, WICKED IN BED will give you long, drawn out erotic bedroom scenes, this will not be what you expect. This book is more about the wickedness of the man than about actual liaisons. It's a reminder that these type men do exist. The most unusual thing about the novel is that it's written by a woman, but it gives real insight into the &quot;dog&quot; in one man. It's a relatively short book and a fast read. The ending was abrupt and left many unanswered questions. Finally, there was a brief epilogue which wasn't much help either.	2001-02-13

She is at the forefront in descriptive eroticism.  There is sex galore, everywhere!!!  SECRET PLEASURES traces one woman's road from a quick and unexpected violent act making her a widow (and  the chief suspect) through treachery and debauchery and then back to some degree of normalcy.  This book questions family commitment and loyalties.  It also looks into the secret night lives of &quot;respectable&quot; people.  The reader is taken into &quot;gentlemen's&quot; clubs consisting of rooms where anything one wishes can be obtained if he (or she) can pay.  SECRET PLEASURES is a different kind of book.

Then it has a realistic and moving story line.  A sexually repressed wife, Elizabeth Petrie, seeks information to make herself more appealing to her husband.  But her teacher, Ramiel SaFyre (a man known for his knowledge and prowess), sees more in her and her situation than she realizes.  He appreciates that she'll go through his embarrassing tutelage, but he wants the dedication she feels toward exciting her husband to be directed toward himself.  The heat in the training sessions where they discuss sexual practices is so steamy that it is easily felt by the reader.  Boundaries are crossed and taboos are broken.  This is a genuine love story mixed with real passion.  The ending is not what the student orginally anticipated ... it's much, much better.  Robin Schone is a name to keep in mind.	2001-02-12

OUR FATHER gives us a peak into the world of the powerful and the powerless, and sends us a chilling reminder that evil does exist.  The most positive part of this book is that the victims get a chance to confront the abuser.  The results of that encounter give us hope.

This story is made more relistic by Attorney Nate O'Riley, and ex-alcoholic, who is giving his all to see that the problems are relsoved quickly, peacefully, and in keeping with the most valid will.

This is a carefully documented study of what's really involved in gang banging.  Nothing is overlooked and no subject is taboo.  Domestic abuse, drug use, robbery, beatings, shooting, stabbing, and murder are thoroughly discussed.  It's a wake up call to the reader that too many young women have gotten off track.

Belle, the heroine goes into a forced marriage, deals with the amorous advances of the King, and has a run through withcraft and sorcery.  Through it all, she maintains her wits, her determination and her dedication to her family and her lands.  Hellion is longer than most romantic novels, but its length allows the author freehand at creating passionate encounters and unexpectd adventures.

We just assume that it would be too ordinary, too sweet and sappy.  However reading THE COLOR OF WATER was one of the most heart-warming experiences I've ever had reading a book.  James McBride, a Black writer, is a master at his craft and could not have done a more thorough job.  His attempt at tribute is actually a revealing history of his White mother's life.  He alternates chapters (as first person speaking) between his mother and himself.  Religion, incest, race and prejudice are discussed in detail.  Through his mother's two marriages to Black men and all of her personal hardships, she remained determined to raise and educate her children to be the best they could be.  This book explores and connects the divisions of race and culture through two generations of family love and education.   The real tribute to Rachel McBride Jordan is the success of all of her children.  This is a woman we'd all be better off for having known.  And a writer-son who knows it.	2001-02-01

Early in the book, the father is arrested, convicted and jailed with all of his money and possessions confiscated by law enforcement.  THE COLDEST WINTER EVER is the story of a displaced Winter and of her efforts to survive and prosper.  It's a real-life scenario of what could and usually does happen to a young person with ghetto mentality who shuns education and legal employment to becomes deeply involved in crime and the illegal drug trade.

Then the tempo builds as the stalker continues to terrorize Niki.  At the same time, Cary dedicates himself to making Niki love him for himself.  The unveiling of the mystery stalker is superb.   The cover of the book could have been more appealing.  It tends to make one think that the book is a comedy, while it is not.

THE HARRIS MEN shows what a devastating impact of being abandoned has on men's lives, and how no matter what level of success of failure they achieve, that impact is a controlling force.  The book also gives a realistict look at what could happen when the father tries for a sudden reunion after a twenty year absence.  Although we are left unclear as to why the father actually left years ago, the intent of the author was to show that's how children really feel.  They never fully understand it.  The novel develops the sons' characters well and shows a lack of direction in their personal goals.  The message is that they've never gotten over the abandonment.  THE HARRIS MEN is very emotional and you can feel the author's personal pain and anger.  Although this books lacks the smoothness and cohesion marked by established writers, it explores an excellent, hardly-explored subject.  Mr. Johnson has a bright future as a writer.	2001-01-23

By a series of coincidences, she runs into an old friend, Eli, and he solves a 30 year old murder mystery (in a way she doesn't expect).  Her actions from that point forward teach two valuable lessons, that Eli isn't the person she remembers and that her own emotions can't be trusted.  Jo, at times is an unsympathetic character, but, while reading this book, I kept thinking, aren't we all.	2000-12-22

This novel involves possible, yet unimagined issues. It's foundation is mystery, based on the desire for unethical profit.  This is a spine-tingling thriller with building suspense in each succeeding chapter.  The varied cast of characters lends to the excellent flow of superstition, rage, murder and unknown elements...all taking place in a town called Tranquility.	2000-12-12

ROSA LEE is a lengthy and well-chronicled look into the daily lives of one multi-generational family in an environment of poverty and drug-infestation, where routine crime and imprisonment are accepted as normal, and where escape is possible, but extremely rare.  I'd recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand the mentality and hopelessness of drug addition.  This story couldn't have been written any clearer than Leon Dash did in ROSA LEE.	2000-12-12

This book will make you a Nora Roberts fan.	2000-12-11

This was a book club selection and I read it as a club requirement.  I'm so glad I did because I thoroughly enjoyed it.  However, if I'd seen it on a book store shelf, I would not have bought it because of its cover.  The cover suggests a level of immaturity which would not appeal to the average book-buying romantic.  Yet the contents were excellent and I look forward to more books by Mr. Weber.	2000-12-08

It so intrigued me that I ordered the novel immediately.  I just knew it was going to be romantic, sensual and adventurous.  I was not disappointed.  This is historical power and romance at its truest and best; a beautiful, spitited, yet honorable lass, two men who love her, and a king with much power and little mercy.  Ms. Smalls is a genius in the arena.	2000-12-01

Starting with Chapter One, it lent possibilty to an unimaginable situation.  From the first, the building tension between the heroine, Alathea and the hero, Gabriel, grew to an explosive point.  The anticipation, passion, and even deeper feelings make this a &quot;read again later&quot; book.  In reading the reviews below, I found this is one in a &quot;Cynster&quot; series.  Well, I'm going to read them all and I'll look forward to what will probably be the final one on the remaining Cynster bachelor, Lucifer.  It's a really good book and very well written.	2000-11-20

The story begins with the discovery of two cases of apparently unrelated, yet bizarre homicides.  The writer takes us on a journey with the main character, Stella Marz, a local prosecutor, aka the Dark Lady, as she investigates the murders, simultaneously uncovering city politics, power, corruption, and sexual fetish.  The reader is expertly carried along a suspenseful ride of distrust, suspicion and up-close terror, culminating in an ending that couldn't be expected.  This mystery proves that Patterson is a master storyteller.	2000-11-16
US	47862135	R14ZRMAPHOU8QV	0446606898	436436025	Dark Torment	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Emotional and Sexual Passion	I just finished reading DARK TORMENT, my first Karen Robards novel and it was so satifying, that I've already ordered a second one. The protagonists, Dominic, a handsome, mysterious and confined stranger, and Sarah, an Austrailian sheep farmer's very plain daughter, meet under the most brutal of circumstances. They show an outward disdain for each other while inwardly they burn with passion. In addition to romance and very descriptive sexual content, this novel is filled with life-and-death adventures. Karen Robards could easily become a romance lover's favorite writer.	2000-11-03

Having followed her from her time with Harlequin to the present, I can honestly say that this is her best novel ever.  I couldn't put it down until it was finished and then I reread several parts.  The main characters, Lee a divorced, White homicide detective and Carol, a divorced, Black art teacher, meet under the most unusual circumstances.  Their connection starts out as one thing, but is nourished and quickly grows into the committed love relationship that most people wish for.  Ms. Kitt's portrayal of these two figures as emotionally mature and honest, lets the reader feel their anguish and their &quot;finest moments.&quot;   The several minor characters play into the entire story, but vividly into suspenseful conclusion.  A must read for lovers of suspense mixed with romance.	2000-10-27
US	47862135	R2VGPRA1M424UC	0345425529	415512987	Waiting in Vain	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Island Flavor	As a first novel, it's one of the most thoroughly researched that I've ever written.  An extra is that Mr. Channer writes in poetic style, which creates a smooth lyrical flow.  He brings an intimate knowledge of New York, Jamaica, and London to paper and intertwines those locations to create dramatic effect.  The story brings together the main characters, Fire, a handsome, confident, and self-sufficient Jamaican artist and Sylvia, a beautiful, status-conscious New Yorker.  The author allows the story to build with strong character development and all the  possibilities of new love.  It's a great love story and a &quot;must&quot; read.  I couldn't put it down until it was finished.  Then I reread some of the juicy parts just because it felt good.  &quot;Waiting in Vain&quot; made me want to &quot;get my groove back.&quot;	2000-10-26

Expect sweetness from &quot;Sugar,&quot; but get the raw reality of growing up displaced, wandering from town to town searching to find one's identity, and never really belonging or finding love.  Sugar uses the sale of her body as a means to survive, and when she finally finds a place to call home, her past catches up with her.  You can't imagine the ending.  You have to read it.	2000-10-25
