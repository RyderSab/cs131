I would love to, but quite frankly I can't afford the price being asked for on the used book circuit.  I can only hope that some publisher will some day put this book back in print.  But I'm not holding my breath.<br />I have read the Amazon.com reviews of this work, as well as several other reviews over the years, and it does sound like an interesting book.  (The 5 Stars are for the reviews I've read ...  I could not complete my own review without doing a rating.)<br />Obviously I cannot accurately comment on the evidence presented in Mr. Knight's book.  I wonder though, is the movie From Hell based in any way on this author's theory?  After seeing that movie, and reading some reviews of Knight's book, I could see some similarities.<br />As for the Masonic connection aspects, I'm not sure that the Masons are part of a worldwide conspiracy, but also I don't believe that every Freemason in the world is an honest, God-fearing, mentally stable person.  Is it so impossible that Jack the Ripper, whoever he was, was a member of the Freemasons?  And would it be unthinkable that some of his fellow Masons might try to help their brother by covering up his tracks?  Surely no Freemason would argue that members of their fraternity are just human and as imperfect as the rest of us ... would they?	2003-12-31

Disfunctional families?  Yes, these are modern pop-psychology terms.  But Paul Nagel shows that these things existed at least two centuries ago, in one of Americas most prominent families.<br />Most of the book discussed the Smith sisters --- Mary, Abigail, and Elizabeth.  What struck me most about these three is how much they came to rely on each other.  This has a good side --- i.e., theres always a sympathetic ear to listen, or a shoulder to cry on, or a pair of hands to pitch in when help was needed.  It has a bad side too --- for often one sisters concern for or about another bordered on interference.  And it seems that the first rule of the Smith Sisters was Never raise your own children when they can be passed on to a relative.  But who knows, maybe that was just the eighteenth century form of day care.<br />The other major chunk of the book describes John Quincy Adams wife Louisa: a very fascinating, intelligent, and educated woman ... whose husband probably did not appreciate her.  If anything, John Quincy appeared rather wimpy compared to Louisa.<br />The final generation discussed in this book is that of Charles Francis Adams and his wife --- also Abigail.<br />Throughout the book we are treated to accounts and anecdotes about the various Adams relatives and in-laws.  It is amazing how the behavior of these people came so close to disgracing or embarrassing the sitting presidents, John or John Quincy.  If it happened today, the Press would be all over it!<br />This was the second of Paul Nagels books on the Adams family that Ive read.  Like his John Quincy Adams, The Adams Women was informative and well-researched, if a bit pedantic in tone.  It brought to life this fascinating family and the era in which they lived.	2003-11-26

Yes, this is officially a \\"kids' book\\" (Ages 9 -14, I believe).  However, I, an adult, read it and found it educating and very interesting.  I got this book during a visit to James Madison's estate Montpelier.  I thought I'd read it first, before getting into the more massive (and more intellectual) biography by Dr. Ketcham.  If you're new to James Madison, I'd recommend doing that.<br />In any case, Jean Fritz' book is an excellent choice for adults as well as children.	2003-09-02

With Some Faults	I was looking for a history of the Japanese monarchy.  There really doesn't seem to be much out there, aside from some individual biographies of Emperors Hirohito and Meiji, and Jerrold M. Packard's excellent Sons of Heaven.  I thought the Seagraves' The Yamato Dynasty might be able to fill a gap and teach me something about Japan's reigning dynasty.  It did that, I suppose.  But it did not do it in a very objective way.<br />The tone of this book is clearly anti-monarchy.  That is, anti-Japanese monarchy.  In many places you get the impression that the authors would have been quite pleased if the entire Japanese monarchy and imperial family had been swept away in 1945 and replaced with a \\"republic.\\"  <br />Most of the book discusses Hirohito and his brothers and uncles, and all the nasty things they did.  Fair enough; maybe Hirohito was a bad guy, maybe he should have been forced to abdicate, and tried as a war criminal.  But then the Seagraves constantly repeat their point that \\"real\\" power in Japan has never been with the emperor at all, but with \\"the oligarchs\\" --- be they shoguns, leaders of the zaibatsu, or underworld \\"godfathers.  If that is so, then how can the authors justify their apparent distaste for the monarchy?  Or their charges against Hirohito and other recent emperors?<br />You can't have it both ways: either Hirohito and his relatives on the throne were powerful enough to commit the abuses they are accused of, or they were virtual puppets (\\"hostages\\" is the word the Seagraves use most often) who merely rubber-stamped whatever their masters behind the scenes told them to.  So which is it?  This book doesn't say, and doesn't provide enough evidence for either case.  Or rather, the authors seem to take both sides, and they present a jumble of conflicting \\"evidence\\" which really doesn't help the reader to make a conclusion either way.<br />That is the major fault of this book: the authors failed to convince me one way or the other.  I picked up theirbook undecided if Hirohito was a \\"war criminal\\" and when I put the book back on the shelf after having read it through, I am still just as undecided!  On the bright side, I did learn some interesting trivia about Japan and its imperial family.  But I think this book should have given me more than just that.<br />A more minor fault of this book, but one I must mention, is the authors' almost blatant anti-American tone.  I've learned to overlook such attitudes in books, particularly ones written by Europeans, so it wasn't really a big deal.  However, if they want their book to be considered \\"real\\" history instead of political diatribe, they really should tone it down just a bit.<br />I'll give this book 3 stars for research, another star for interesting writing; but I'll subtract one star because the book did not give me much beyond some trivia, and another star because the authors failed to make any convincing arguments to prove their point (whatever their point was!)  I will say that the book made interesting light reading for summer vacation.	2003-08-22

The name --- and that she was an actress in the distant past --- was about all I knew about her ... until I read Eve Goldens excellent book.  I got this book more or less on a whim; but from it I learned a great deal about this fascinating actress with the cool name.  It turns out that she probably was a pretty cool person as well!  In fact, this book led me to seek out copies of the few remaining movies Miss Bara made --- such a pity that more examples of her work dont exist.  The examples Ive seen are, it is often said, not her best; but she seems to have been quite a capable actress.<br />This is not a review of Miss Bara, however, but of Ms. Goldens book.  And a great book it is: informative, well-illustrated (I agree with the authors philosophy that a biography without pictures is like a cake without icing), and with a clear writing style.  It is extremely well-researched too --- the numerous quotes from contemporary reviews of Miss Baras movies shows that Ms. Golden did her homework. <br />I dont know exactly what some reviewers meant when they noted Ms. Goldens sarcastic attitude.  I enjoyed her writing.  Her book was informative, not too scholarly, and written with good humor.  I think its a book Miss Bara herself might have liked.  It certainly succeeded in sparking my interest in this actress, and in the genre of silent films in general.<br />In this book you will learn not only about Theda Baras life and work; you will also discover much about the early film industry, and about Hollywood publicity operations too.  And heres an interesting tidbit:  the cool name was not really an invention of a Hollywood studio at all; in fact, the Arab Death story came about as an afterthought, long after the name itself had stuck on Theodosia (Theda) Goodman.	2003-03-04

This is an interesting collection of essays on the origins of many common household items.<br />Some of these essays stray off the point a bit.  I'm still not clear as to how the Nautillus exercise machine, or shatterproof glasses, or the electrical outlet were invented.  But all-in-all, this book was informative as well as easy and fun to read.  In addition to (or, in a few cases, instead of) just an account of how something was invented, it tells you some interesting (and sometimes disturbing) details of the lives of various inventors.<br />I haven't read Charles Panati's &quot;Extraordinary Origins of Everyday Things&quot; (which some reviewers think is better than &quot;House of Invention&quot;).  Perhaps that one might be worth a look too.  In any case, I recommend Mr. Lindsay's book as well.	2003-02-24

It is well-written, shows much research, and is copiously illustrated.<br />My only &quot;complaint&quot; is that it is so short --- about 60 pages, and much of that is taken up by photographs and maps.  In spite of the brevity, I came away with the feeling that I had gotten a fine account of the Freikorps.  I don't feel that anything was &quot;left out.&quot;  But this book was more like a long magazine article.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, except that it is priced like a book.<br />This was the first of Osprey's &quot;Men-At-Arms&quot; series I've ever read.  I find the series impressive, especially for its illustrations.  Would I read another book of the series?  Certainly!  Would I BUY it?  Not likely ...

There are chapters on Shinto's/Japan's response to the introduction of new religious ideas --- namely Confucianism, Buddhism, and Christianity --- and on its reaction to the rise of the shoguns, and to the sudden introduction of Western ways in the mid-nineteenth century.<br />All-in-all, this is an informative, educational book.<br />One word of caution is in order, however: Hearn wrote this book in 1904.  It is therefore somewhat dated; and the author's flowery Victorian-era prose might put some readers off.  Same can be said for his use of nineteenth century anthropological terms and references --- words such as \\"Aryan,\\" for example.  Still, if the reader can look past Hearn's personal prejudices, this book is a fine history of Shinto up until the year 1904.<br />To complete a study of Shinto, of course, it would be necessary to learn of the religion's development through the Second World War and beyond.  I am not aware of any book bringing the history of Shinto into the present, but perhaps they exist ... in English.	2002-08-30

And, judging from a search of Amazon.com, there don't appear to be too many biographies about James Cook in print. Mr. Hough's book is much easier to read than Beaglehole's; and it is a good introduction to start with before tackling Cook's Journals.<br />One thing that caught my attention was how radically different Captain Cook behaved on his third and final voyage.  On the earlier voyages, he acted much more decisively, and showed remarkable concern for his men.  They in turn developed great affection and respect for their leader.<br />On that last fateful voyage, Cook acted very much out of character.  He was short-tempered, even cruel.  He made hasty or stupid decisions and took foolish risks.  At more than one point the crew was close to mutiny.<br />Hough explains that perhaps Cook was suffering from a parasitic infection or other physical and mental afflictions.  This might explain his unusual behavior.  It also occured to me that perhaps the good captain was simply \\"burned out\\" (to use a modern phrase).  After having completed two round-the-world trips of 2-plus years each, the last thing this man needed was another long voyage.  Even his superiors in the Admiralty knew he needed and deserved a rest.  Cook himself must have known that too.  Yet, his sense of duty impelled him to volunteer for one more mission.  The Admirals should never have permitted it.  Certainly not so soon after Cook's return from Voyage Two.<br />This is a good book.  I have long admired James Cook; now after reading Hough's work, I list the captain among my heroes.<br />One final note: another reviewer asks why Cook was \\"always returning to Tahiti.\\"  Perhaps I missed something, but I only counted three visits by Cook to that island.  Once to observe an astronomical event (the official reason for his First Voyage); later (on his Second Voyage) because his ship was in need of repairs and supplies; and then on the Third Voyage to return aTahitian they had taken to England on the previous trip --- and this was the official reason for the Third Voyage.<br />On second thought, could anyone fault Cook for frequenting the beautiful Polynesian islands?  Perhaps a few months on the beach --- but away from his work! --- would have saved the man's life!	2002-07-01
US	52845740	R1AL75TEWRGSE3	0631154531	231076430	Mary Tudor: A Life	Books	5	30	33	N	N	At Last, An Accurate Portrait of Mary I	Too many books about Mary I, Queen of England, daughter of Henry VIII, portray her as either cruel and vindictive, or as a religious fanatic out to stifle the religious freedom of her subjects.  David Loades' biography is a welcome exception.<br />Mr. Loades tells the story of the shy Princess of Wales who was, successively, virtually disowned by her father; hounded for her devotion to her mother and her Church; forced to compromise her beliefs; constantly threatened by her brother's regency council; almost deprived of her rightful elevation to the throne by an upstart cousin; and finally accepted as queen by most of her people; then ultimately branded as \\"Bloody Mary\\" by history.<br />In fact, as this book shows, Mary Tudor remained throughout her life a pious, quiet, trusting woman whose worst mistke was  perhaps that she allowed herself to be too influenced by her advisers and confidantes (such as Emperor Charles V and Cardinal Pole).  This \\"mildest and most merciful of the Tudors,\\" when she acted harshly, did so only out of a sense of duty --- a monarch must punish wrongdoers and rebels.<br />As for the charge that Mary I tampered with her people's  religious freedom, that is absurd.  There was no such thing as religious freedom anywhere in Britain or the world in the sixteenth century.  On the contrary, as Loades points out, Mary's religious views probably reflected those of most of her subjects.  It was only after her death, when her sister Elizabeth took power, that Mary's reputation began to be soiled.<br />A good part of this book --- perhaps a bit too much of it --- is devoted to all the intrigues and \\"wheeling-and-dealing\\" involved in royal marriage arrangements.  Not just involving Mary, but also Elizabeth, and their lusty father as well.  Still, such details are necessary, if tedious, as marriage was an important concern of Medieval royalty.<br />To sum up, this is an excellent book, and should be read by all scholars and amateur historians interested in the Tudor period.  I think it gives an accurate account of Mary I, without either ignoring her failures or concentrating solely on her (not deserved) reputation.  If this book is still out of print, it should be reprinted.  It is a necessary book.	2002-02-27

Reading Bruce Cummings' book &quot;Korea's Place in the Sun&quot; was a flashback to my college days.  I had a radical history professor --- good teacher, nice guy, but his constant rants against US foreign policy through the ages got old very fast.  That teacher was not Mr. Cummings ... but the two could be good friends!<br />On Page 385, Professor Cummings says that &quot;In the 1980s the American Embassy in Seoul had the hallucination&quot; that his writings had encouraged anti-American demonstrations.  He calls the charge &quot;pure nonsense.&quot;  But if his earlier writings had the same tone as this book, I can understand why someone might have such a &quot;hallucination.&quot;<br />Cummings' chapters on pre-World War II Korea are the most interesting (and least offensive) in the book.  The chapter on &quot;Industrialization, 1953 - 1996&quot; is rather bogged down with economic and financial information --- but is still readable.<br />Unless you're a left-leaning academic, you might want to skip or skim the chapters on the post- WW II occupation and the Korean War.  (And if you are a left-leaning academic, there's probably little in this book that you haven't already heard or mused upon anyway!)<br />The chapter on Korean-Americans was simply a 21-page litany of how racist white- and African-Americans have been, and how they continue to hold stereotypes about Koreans.  (It does not occur to the professor that perhaps, for example, the reason ABC's sitcom &quot;All American Girl&quot; failed was simply because it was just not a very good show; no, it was those racist Americans who couldn't accept an Asian actress on TV!)<br />I also question some of Cummings' &quot;facts.&quot;  Just one example is the famous &quot;Tree-Cutting Incident&quot; of August, 1976, when North Korean border guards at the DMZ brutally murdered two American officers supervising  South Korea workers sent to trim branches to give the Southern guards a clearer view of the area.  Cummings(Page 469) claims that the tree was being trimmed by North Koreans ... and implies that the South Koreans and Americans overreacted.  (Don Oberdorfer has a different --- and I think more accurate --- account of this incident in his book &quot;The Two Koreas,&quot; PP 74 - 83.)<br />While it seems that Cummings is primarily negative toward USA, I can't say he is totally biased in favor of North Korea and its allies.  There is criticism that --- considering how sensitive the DPRK is most of the time --- would offend the folks in Pyongyang.  Still, Cummings' general attitude indicates that he blames America for a lot.<br />Toward the end of his tome (Page 473) --- after so many pages of pointing out America's failures and North Korea's good points or innocence --- the author admits: &quot;The point is not that North Korea is a nice place ... beyond suspicion ....  Quite the contrary, its policy for half a century has been to pile lie upon lie, exaggeration upon exaggeration ....  But that is what we have learned to expect from communist regimes.  What is the excuse for [such behavior] in the US?&quot;<br />Apparently, the author has a very naive view of how USA should be: perfect and beyond reproach at all times in a very imperfect world.  One would think that a college professor would be more sophisticated than that!<br />One more comment:  Hasn't Cummings heard of the 1990s famine that has racked North Korea?  I suspect that the conditions he raves about in DPRK --- the high life expectancy, the low infant mortality, the regime's economic self-sufficiency --- no longer apply (if they ever did!)<br />Bottom line: This is a well-written book.  It succeeded in keeping my interest, for the most part.  In spite of the cheerleading it does for Kim Il Sung &amp; Co., it is probably well-researched.  But I would not recommend it as one for beginners. If you're new to Korean (or Cold War) history, start somewhere else.  When you do read this one, be prepared.  Or, as anotherreviewer said, &quot;read with caution.&quot;	2001-11-19

For students and amateur historians seeking to learn about the Roaring 20s, this would be a good choice.<BR>Secondly, this book has relevance to our own time as well. As the author constantly notes, there are many parallels between Prohibition in the 20s and today's &quot;War on Drugs.&quot; What I found most tragic about the campaign to outlaw alcohol in the 20s was the naivte of people in authority, thinking they could change behavior through legislation. As history shows, the 18th Amendment led not to the elimination of alcohol consumption in America, but rather to a general disrespect for law and law enforcement personnel. And the absence of most legal liquor simply resulted in a profusion of illegal liquor, which in turn enriched and encouraged the notorious &quot;gangsters&quot; of the era.<BR>This book has made me rethink my opinion of the &quot;War on Drugs,&quot; and on Prohibition itself. I am not a drinker, nor do I use drugs; so I have always had an indifferent attitude toward prohibition legislation, perhaps sometimes even leaning in favor of a legal clampdown. However, after reading Mr. Behr's account of what happened to America during the 13 years of Prohibition, I now seriously doubt both the effectiveness and the wisdom of such laws.<BR>Perhaps the New York politician of the era, Fiorello La Guardia, had it right when he said, &quot;Excessive drinking [and drug use, for that matter] can be curbed by education, not legislation.&quot;<BR>To sum up, this is a book that will not only teach you a bit of history; it will also make you think. I recommend it!	2001-08-30

Allen).  Both of these books mentioned Sinclair Lewis' novel Babbitt, so I thought I'd check it out.<br />After the introduction to this period I got from the above-mentioned histories, I found Babbitt to be a nice companion piece and a good continuation of my study of Roaring 20s America.<br />Written in 1922 and set in 1920, this novel gives what I think is a good picture of USA in that time.  True, Lewis' own prejudices against the upper middle class businessman of his era shine through.  But I think the cultural insights we see in the novel are quite accurate.  We can take the Babbitt's and their friends as typical representatives of their time and social class --- we see their &quot;typical&quot; day, their &quot;typical&quot; vacations, pasttimes, and activities.  Even the colloquialisms are interesting; I can see how they can become annoying after a while, but they do add a reality to the story.<br />I recommend Babbitt, the other two books I mentioned, and perhaps Edward Behr's book Prohibition as a package for the ambitious amateur historian who seeks to understand what life in our grand parents' and great grand parents' America was like.  I think if you get through all four you'll have a pretty good idea of what things were like in that time period.	2001-04-13

A friend recommended &quot;Mosby's Rangers&quot; by  Jeffrey Wert; my wife suggested a new book, James Ramage's &quot;Gray  Ghost.&quot;  But I opted to begin my study with Mosby's own account of his  adventures: his own memoirs.<br />I know that old soldiers tend to exaggerate  their war stories; and they occasionally ramble.  But Mosby's Memoirs are  still fascinating, and I think the exaggeration is kept to a minimum.  The  story does get a bit bogged down in Chapter 12 --- talking about events  leading up to Gettysburg.  The good colonel, like all soldiers, is also  somewhat wordy discussing the merits and failures of various generals and  officers in the war.<br />Still, all things considered, I found this to be  quite interesting.  I don't usually read military memoirs, but I enjoyed  this.  Now on to &quot;Gray Ghost!&quot;<br />Oh, another thing that made this  book (and, presumably any book on John Mosby's exploits) fun to read: he  mentions so many towns, roads, and places already familiar to me.  Last  weekend I took a drive to Beaverdam, VA just to see what was left of the  train station near where the Yankees captured Mosby early in his career (he  was shortly released).  Couldn't find the station, but the tracks are still  there!  If you're familiar with Northern VA &amp; the Shenandoah Valley,  check out this book!	1999-12-06

Today the Shakers are virtually extinct but they are  best-remembered for their distinctive furniture.<br />Edward D. Andrews was an  authority on the Shakers and he wrote several books on these fascinating  people.  A good place to start your study is with his &quot;A People Called  Shakers.  Then move into this book, &quot;Work &amp; Worship Among the  Shakers,&quot; before getting into works by other authors on the  subject.<br />Deming tells the interesting story of the Shakers, and makes you  wish there were still some Shaker villages to visit.  But alas, they're all  gone, victims of the Modern World!  Deming's books are the next best thing!	1999-10-20

The stories are divided into several groupings, such as &quot;Tales for Children&quot; -- a misnomer, because all of these stories  are suitable for adults and children alike -- &quot;Popular Stories&quot;  &quot;Folk Tales&quot; and others.<br />Tolstoy -- known for massive novels  and obscure philosophical essays -- was actually quite adept at the short  story, as this book demonstrates.  These stories make excellent bedtime  reading for children, who, with a little explanation from mom or dad will  readilly understand and appreciate them.  These stories are also useful for  adults, and I would especially recommend some of them to ministers,  priests, or deacons, who could use the stories in their sermons to  illustrate the points of human nature.	1999-09-30

This is the first one of her books  I've read, and I am eager to move on to another volume, perhaps Child Life in Colonial Days. Mrs. Earle's  &quot;Home Life&quot; is a fascinating description of everyday life --- the  chores, the tools, the dwelling places, the foods, the sights and sounds  --- that Colonial Americans knew.   Have you ever seen a strange tool or  implement in a museum, an antique shop, or hanging on the wall at a country  restaurant, and no one seems to know exactly what it is or what it was used  for?  Read this book: its many illustrations will more than likely include  that mysterious object; and Mrs. Earle will describe clearly what it was  and how it was used.  This book should be in the library of every  enthusiast of American antiques.  Without a doubt, this book contains  information found nowhere else in a book now in print. This is not a  history of Colonial America --- although it contains many interesting  tidbits about our country's earliest days.  It is, however, an excellent  description of everyday life in  America, 1600 - 1800, with special  emphasis on New England and Virginia.  As such, this book would be useful  not just to historians and antique collectors, but to writers, museum  curators, and anyone who wants to understand Colonial America.	1999-09-21

So many separate events --- the First World War, the ascension of Emperor Charles of Austria, the failure of his peace plan, the reign of Czar Nicholas of Russia, the shenanigans of Rasputin, the collapse of Russia's  first revolutionary government and the rise of Lenin --- all these are tied  together to show that God really is in control.  The appearance of the  Blessed Virgin Mary in Portugal in that fateful year of 1917 brings it all  home. I have long been fascinated by the events of the Russian Revolution,  but until I read this book I had only a vague notion of the pattern, the  proof, that these were not just random events happening without reason.  Human beings brought about the terrible First World War, and all the  tragedies and disasters that led to Russia's fall to Communism.  But God  has managed to let all things work for good, ultimately. This is a  fascinating and educational book.  Enjoy it!	1999-09-07

I really can't say it better than  alfonso_trujillo@hotmail.com from San Diego, except to add another great book that gives a fine explanation of the Roman Catholic Church.  That would be the similarly-titled &quot;The  Catholic Controversy,&quot; by St. Francis de Salles.  This truly is a  masterpiece of defense of the Catholic Faith.  I don't know why James R.  White chose the title he did for his book, but I can't help wondering if he  thought he might in that way mislead readers looking for St. Francis'  marvellous tome.  In any case, I urge everyone who is interested &amp; who  wants to know the truth about the Catholic Church to read St. Francis'  book.  Then decide for yourself who makes the most sense about sola  scriptura, etc.	1999-08-06

And this book has not convinced me to side with those who feel that way.  For that reason  I cannot give it the full &quot;5 Stars.&quot;   However, the author has  presented his case well, has provided ample evidence, and has written in an  interesting manner.  I do not totally dismiss everything he says --- on the  contrary, there is undoubtedly some truth to his notion.   To those seeking  to know about  Adam Weishaupt, the &quot;Freemason conspiracy,&quot; and  this line of thinking in general, I would recommend this as a good starting  point.  After reading this book, you may want to look into some of the  classics on the subject, such as Robeson &amp; Abbe Barruel.	1999-07-02

In March, 1977 the king, his wife,and  sons were suddenly spirited away from their palace, never to be seen by the  world again.  For almost 25 years no one inside or outside Laos seemed to  know what happened to them.<br />Christopher Kremmer, an Australian  journalist, was apparently one of the first Westerners admitted to certain  parts of Laos since the Communist victory.  In this book he describes his  determined search to find out what happened to the country's last royal  family.  His ability --- and luck --- to discover what he did is amazing.   Kremmer describes interviews and meetings with Laotians of all walks of  life --- communists, royals, returned exiles, business people, peasants ---  as he traverses the country.  What is really surprising is that he actually  gets answers --- and somewhere in those answers may be the truth.  I'll say  one thing for Kremmer:  he is bold with his questions!<br />In addition, this  book is filled with fascinating descriptions of Laos.  I'll probably never  get to visit Laos, but after having read Kremmer's account of the sights,  sounds, smells, and tastes of that country, I feel like I've already been  there.  I wish there were more pictures, but the ones included show a  beautiful country.<br />For those fortunate enough to travel to Laos, this  would be essential reading before your trip.	1999-01-29

This is a wonderful book that describes the last days of Czar Nicholas II and his family.  The emphasis is on the children --- son Alexis and daughters Anastasia, Maria, Tatyana, and Olga.  <br />The book is based on the  recollections of the children's tutor, Pierre Gilliard, who accompanied  them in exile for a time.  It is filled with photographs, letters, and  other memorobilia from Monsieur Gilliard's collection.  These provide a  delightful side to the tragic story of the last days of the Romanovs.<br />It  is a pity that this wonderful book is out of print.	1999-01-28

I received a copy of Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution as a gift several years ago.  I've been interested in the French Revolution since high school, and I used to enjoy leafing through this book, looking  at the pictures and reading a paragraph here and there.  However, I was  intimidated by the sheer size of this book --- over 800 pages of text!  I  never thought I'd have the time to sit and read it from cover to cover.<br />I  finally decided one day to just start at Page 1 and see how far I got.  It  took me 4 months, and it involved missing hours of sleep, and ignoring many  other books, magazines, and newspapers.  But it was worth every minute!<br />I  won't get into the details about why this book is worth reading --- my  fellow reviewers have done that rather well.  Suffice it to say that this  is an excellent volume and a must-read for anyone interested in this period  of history.  Don't be intimidated by the number of pages!  Read and enjoy!	1999-01-26

Bob and Penny Lord have written about a dozen excellent books explaining and defending the Holy Roman Catholic Church.  They do so in a spirit of love, not anger or hatred.<br />&quot;Cults&quot; explains succinctly and  interestingly what various groups --- such as Mormonism, Adventism,  Christian Science, the Unification Church, The Jehovahs Witnesses,  Hinduism, and various New Age sects and cults --- believe; why they can be  considered &quot;cults;&quot; why they cannot be considered Christian; and  why Christians of all denominations should stay clear --- or at least be  wary --- of them.<br />Members of the groups mentioned in this book may be  offended that they are being called &quot;cults.&quot;  But they will be  hard-pressed to deny that the Lords' description of their beliefs are  accurate.  The book does not outright condemn the cults; it merely explains  where they are coming from and what they believe.  The book does not  outright say, &quot;Never join these groups;&quot; but rather, &quot;Before  you get in too deeply know what you're getting into, and what you may be  giving up.&quot;<br />This is definitely a book I'd recommend, especially to  spiritual-minded young people in high school and college.  If I had read a  book like this in my younger days I might have been spared many fruitless  years of &quot;searching for the Truth.&quot;<br />I can find only one fault  with this book, and it is not in the content or writing.  It seems as if  the publisher or editor needs to do a bit of proof-reading to eliminate  some misspellings and grammatical errors; also toward the end of the book  some of the footnote numbers are incorrect.  But overlook these minor  points and enjoy this book!	1999-01-12

It was during this time that the various Amish congregations split between a  &quot;liberal&quot; and a &quot;conservative&quot; wing.  The  &quot;conservatives&quot; ultimately became what most Americans know as  &quot;Amish&quot; --- people clinging to their (apparently) unchanging  lifestyle.  The &quot;liberals&quot; continued to split and merge, adopting  &quot;modern&quot; technology, styles, and ways, and for the most part  becoming part of the mainstream Mennonite or Protestant religious  tradition.<br />It has often been pointed out --- especially by tour guides in  Amish areas --- that the Old Order Amish lived, dressed, and traveled just  like most Americans in the early nineteenth century, but they did not  change as the rest of America did as that century progressed.  In fact,  some Amish did indeed change, becoming &quot;modern.&quot;  This book  explains how the change ocurred, and why some Amish resisted the trend they  saw around them.<br />It is an interesting, scholarly, book, full of  references, but easy to read.	1998-12-30

There is undoubtedly a great deal of accuracy in  that view.  But China also has a tradition of seafaring and exploration of  the outside world that goes back at least 4000 years.  These two opposing  philosophies --- on the one hand, the Confucian attitude of keeping China  self-sufficient and isolated; on the other a desire to reach out for trade,  profit, or mere curiosity --- have sometimes clashed throughout Chinese  history.<br />Louise Levathes' book When China Ruled the Seas documents one  such clash. Shortly after Emperor Zhu Di seized the throne from his young  nephew, he ordered the construction of a vast ocean-going fleet.   Possibly  rumors that the previous emperor had fled abroad --- his body was never  identified with certainty --- motivated a search  of neighboring lands.   Perhaps too Zhu Di felt the need to announce to his neighbors that he had  ascended the Dragon Throne.  But probably the major reason for construction  of the enormous fleet was trade.  After years of civil war, China's  treasury was depleted and her economy was in shambles.  Nothing would  revive things like an influx of tribute from China's nominal vassal  states.<br />So orders went out all over China for the construction of over  1,600 vessels of all types.  Most impressive of all were four Treasure  Ships, each over 400 feet long and 160 feet wide, designed to carry Chinese  products overseas for trade, and to bring back foreign goods in return.   Between 1405 and 1433 the &quot;Treasure Fleet&quot; --- usually under  command of the eunuch Zhang He --- made seven trips to various ports of  call in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.  Not only was contact  re-established with China's traditional vassals in Korea, Japan, Vietnam,  Siam, and Indonesia, but the Treasure Fleet also reached India, and  ultimatelywent as far as the Persian Gulf, the Arabian peninsula, and East  Africa.  Levathes even speculates that Chinese ships touched on  Australia.<br />Within a decade China was at the height of its influence, and  had become the most advanced sea power at the time.  But wealth from the  foreign trade went mainly to the imperial court.  For the common people the  Treasure Fleet brought higher taxes and demanding officials seeking  supplies for the fleet.  By the last years of Zhu Di's reign China was  beset with poor harvests, famine and epidemics at home and rebellion  abroad.  The emperor began to rethink his extravagant policies and ordered  cutbacks in trade and government expenditures.     The days of Chinese  ascendancy on the seas had passed.  The Treasure Fleet was allowed to  decay, Zhang He's logs were destroyed, and by 1500 it was a capital crime  to build ocean-going vessels.  This led to a decline in Chinese technology  in general, so that eventually the West surpassed China, and the Middle  Kingdom was relegated to the status of a third-class nation.<br />How  different the world today would be if history had taken another course; if  the Chinese had discovered America from the East.  This might have been  possible had the Treasure Fleet been maintained rather than mothballed.	1998-11-27

All-in-all, I found this to be an excellent  book that has helped me understand Iranian history and culture.<br />I do find  one fault, however.  Mackey seems unable to say that Shah Mohammed Reza did  any good at all, although she spends much time and many paragraphs  ridiculing and criticizing the man.  Even when she grudgingly admits that  he helped advance the status of women (page 261), she immediately adds that  he did so only for his own motives.  I am no fan of dictators --- and Shah  Mohammed Reza, like his father, was definitely a dictator ---  but I do  believe in giving credit where credit is due.  I see Shah Mohammed Reza as  a reformer who helped his nation advance and did so as much out of  patriotism and love of his people as out of personal ambition.<br />Mackey's  coverage of post-revolutionary Iran --- taking up the final third of the  book --- is objective, interesting, and shows a good knowledge and  experience of the subject.<br />I also found her account of the 1906  Constituional Revolution informative, as I had not had much knowledge of  that event.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about  Iran's past or present.  It's a must-read for anyone planning a trip to  this fascinating country.	1998-10-26

But before reading those you might want to read his History of Ethiopia.<br />Marcus traces the history of this fascinating but mysterious land back to earliest times, and takes it right up to the fall of Mengistu in 1991.  Perhaps someday a revision should be done to add events that took place after that, but right now it is too soon; history is still being made in Ethiopia.  Most of the book deals with the period after about 1850, but as I said, if you're looking for a good general history filled with facts and details, this is it.	1998-06-15
