This novel is forced, artificially prolonged, sometimes trite, and leaves the reader frustrated that she/he wasted so much time for so little payoff. <br /> <br />Alan Banks is on holiday from his police job, and he gets a worrisome message on his answering machine from his prodigal brother Roy.  Alan is a good fella, so he goes around London trying to find Roy and find out what prompted the phonecall.  Meanwhile, the entire police force is trying to get ahold of Banks because a murder victim had his address in her back pocket.  For at least half the novel, Banks plods along looking through his brother's life, completely unaware of a related investigation that his sometime partner/sometime lover is leading.  It is ludicrous to think Annie Cabot and Banks couldn't have communicated with each other for all that time.  The novel could've been much shorter except for this forced detour. <br /> <br />We don't even have an idea as to why the woman was murdered (in the first chapter) until the last 20 pages of the novel.  So the intervening pages are just \\"Gee, why did that happen?  Gee, who could've done such a think?  Gee, who's that man in the photograph?\\"  The plot doesn't really advance--it just circles the airport waiting for an open gate wasting fuel.  In the meantime, the reader has long wished she started a different book and left Banks and Annie Cabot to slosh along in their petty problems. <br /> <br />The title is corny and unfitting for the novel, and this book falls into the trap of making a mystery based on human rights groups' pet project.  In summary, this was just plain boring!  Banks and Annie make no progress in character development.  You could just skip this novel and not miss a beat in the soap opera this series has become.  Boo!	2005-10-02

Our narrator, Gregory Lynn, is quite bright--but he is so introspective that he is never capable of relating effectively with others.  So he's in his own little world. <br /> <br />When his mother dies, his last tie to reality snaps.  At the same time, he finds his teachers' evaluations of him and his work at school.  One teacher was vicious and a bully; one was kind; one almost understood him--so the teaching profession is not lambasted as there are a few good people whom Gregory truly liked.  Now that he's on his own, both in his dreamworld and in the real world, he wants to find these teachers and make them see his perspective (and punish those who were cruel to him). <br /> <br />This novel is enjoyable because it is unique in its subject matter, at least for me, and because almost all of us had teachers who were unkind to us at very vulnerable times in our developement.  Who wouldn't like to find a bully who was once in a position of authority and give the bully a piece of his mind? <br /> <br />The book rambles quite a bit, and this really drags it down.  The author quite thoroughly convinces us of our narrator's insanity, but that doesn't make the rantings of a lunatic more interesting.  Mr. Bedford does a nice job of describing the kind of childhood that fostered and nutured the madness, and that is always a key point in making a serial criminal credible.  It's an interesting first effort, but I'm glad I'm through with it and on to my next novel.	2005-10-02

McCarthy is a splendid wordsmith, and his dry and witty writing style are well suited to the storyline and setting.  Happily, this starts off an entertaining trio of books starring the nomad forensic pathologist John Eisenmenger and his lovely attorney-assistant Helena Flemming.    In this tale, a gruesome murder is committed and displayed in the hallowed center of the anatomy and pathology museum on a medical school campus.  The police, and later our protagonists, investigate what seems more and more like an inside job--not a paranoid schizophrenic on PCP who broke into the museum to harm a helpless medical student.    Strong points:  the writing, the writing, and the writing.  Also, the characters are deftly drawn and handled well.  McCarthy's thoughtful portraits set up a nice cast of characters for the books to come in this series.  I certainly think the medical expertise helps me enjoy this gruesome caper a bit more, although naming most of the characters and street names after historically famous medical people can sometimes be a bit distracting (if you have a medical background and recognize them...).    The weaknesses in this story are few but real.  There are too many deaths/suicides to be quite believeable, and there are too many unethical and immoral professors of pathology to be believable (though perhaps Dr. McCarthy, a pathologist himself, gets a kick out of doing this!).  Overall, this is a strong debut in a writing style not too far removed from Reginald Hill--thoughtful, educated readers will enjoy it if they have the stomach for the anatomic details.	2005-09-09

It's easy to keep reading, but not so compelling that you stay up all night to finish it. <br /> <br />Frank Elder has retired as a police officer in the Nottinghamshire police force, and he now leads a quiet and lonely life in Cornwall (being introspective no doubt).  His interest in the outside world is engaged when a teen he sent to prison is set to be released--at almost that same time, crimes this boy committed prior to incarceration begin to surface again.  Elder, because he has a vested and personal interest in the boy he sent to prison and the crimes this boy committed, becomes peripherally involved with the police as he and they investigate a new stint of kidnappings and murderings involving 16-year-old girls. <br /> <br />Elder is just a shade different from the usual detective.  He is not morose or depressed (at least not too much), he doesn't have an alcohol problem, and he doesn't brood about all the horrible things he saw as a detective.  He is honest and honorable, and he's likeable without being perfect. <br /> <br />The mystery is fairly engaging, and the conclusion is realistic and not too melancholy.  Also, something I really liked in this book was a proper conclusion--something that has fallen out of style in this era of crime fiction!  Frank follows all the loose ends of the case and ties them up for us, long after the perpetrators are in custody.  En fin, it's a well plotted English suspense/crime novel written by a veteran who still has a masterhold on his craft.	2005-08-25

I am convinced she doesn't read the books she \\"reviews\\".  They can't all be \\"Excellent Police Procedurals\\" Harriet!  Before her \\"review\\" of this novel, I knew she would rate it 5 stars and call it an \\"Excellent Australian Police Procedural\\".  She just skims the blurb, thumbs through the chapters, and then logs on to this venerable website.  I don't think she's ever given a novel anything but five stars--check her other \\"reviews\\" and you'll see that I'm right. <br /> <br />Now to the novel.  The problem here is that one doesn't care who did the crimes as none of the suspects or victims catches our sympathy at all.  One can't be all too sad if one bum kills another bum--even though we know she/he shouldn't do it.  Of course, Hal is still the brooding, solitary, and quite melancholy hero of the story.  Ellen is the female counterpart.  Nothing happens to them throughout the course of this novel.  It's tiring to read books, or worse, a series, in which the characters remain stagnant. <br /> <br />The writing is straightforward, and Disher is still better than most at his craft.  Think of something new!  Have Challis find a friend--something!	2005-08-01

I absolutely loved The Silent Sleep of the Dying, and I was chagrined to see McCarthy stumble on this mired tale of slashings and slayings. <br /> <br />POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD--> If you've ever read Agatha Christie, you will almost certainly recognize one of her plot designs; a la ABC Murders.  Coming across it here made me think there was a contractual deadline that forced the book to flower too quickly. <br /> <br />Why do authors think one or several of the main characters must be the last victim in a series of horrible torture-type crimes?  It seems predictable and smacking of one trying to prepare a novel that could still pass off as a Hollywood screenplay. <br /> <br />Lastly--there is no character development.  None whatsoever.  Eisenmenger and Flemming stay almost exactly the same, in essence.  I just can't believe these purportedly attractive, successful, and professional individuals would have no relationships (either with each other or with other people).  The can't all be brooding and tough, solitary and staid with a dollop of melancholy.  It's the trite detective of many decades, and it just won't wash.  Tragedy like these characters face would throw them into relationships as they seek solace and meaning in their world. <br /> <br />McCarthy still is a better author than most, and even this mediocre effort was more worthwhile than many competitors' books.  However; if he is to really make his mark on a crowded genre, he will have to go more slowly and try harder to place himself in Eisenmenger's shoes.	2005-08-01
US	39128555	R2LZ9WJ3RZWBAE	0375726411	81622798	Palladio	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Just Sort of Disappeared!	This is a finely wrought novel of love and relationships in the 21st century--with a twist of irony and cynicism.  Originating in upstate NY, the story follows John and Molly as their lives collide in an all consuming love affair and the aftermath of Molly's disappearance. <br /> <br />The first story in the novel deals with the unreachable (and unsinkable?) Molly.  She is largely apathetic to her life and surroundings, even though she is a femme fatale whom no man seems able to resist.  She recognizes her power over men and enjoys eliciting passion and emotion from them, but she seldom has any feelings apart from a gentle curiosity towards those with whom she has sex. <br /> <br />Molly meets John, and she falls in love--albeit in her own way--comfortable in that he demands nothing of her and seems content to spend his life loving her and trying to figure her out.  Because she cannot form significant emotional ties to others, even John, she uses her father's nervous breakdown to disappear from John's life--only to reappear in the latter part of the novel that deals with Palladio itself. <br /> <br />Palladio is the company formed with the goal of using art as advertising.  There is no pitch to the potential consumer--the company produces art of any kind--be it written or painted, cinematographic, etc.  John ends up as a personal executive to Mal, the founder of the company.  The idea of getting rid of traditional advertising seems very appealing, and one longs for a world where commercials on television or ads in magazines appeal to our artistic sense instead of trying to \\"trick\\" the consumer into purchasing a product. <br /> <br />These two stories come together in a predictable fashion, and the reader is fascinated by the concept of Palladio and whether or not it can succeed with such a bold corporate philosophy.  More importantly, we are excited to see if John and Molly can come together again and mend the rift in John's soul caused by Molly's disappearance manywhen they were young. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the ending does not prove satisfactory and just sort of fades into a series of bumper stickers the origins of which are unknown to the reader.  If there had been a less esoteric ending to this well written and thoughtful novel, I could easily have given it four stars.  Dee has a lot of promise, but this would not be a novel I'd recommend to start reviewing his work.	2005-07-11

While following the escapades of Macon Leary, the hero of our story, the author teaches a gentle lesson about adult interpersonal relationships--the quote is as follows: <br /> <br />\\"...he began to believe that people could, in fact, be used up--could use each other up, could be of no further help to each other and maybe even do harm to each other.  He began to think that who you are when you're with somebody may matter more than whether you love her.\\" <br /> <br />The book is a little too long, although nicely and thoughtfully written.  The sentence structure varies nicely, and her characters are quirky, believable, and scarily like everyone's goofy side of the family.  I did find myself chuckling out loud at a few of Macon's foibles and eccentricities; and that made this not only a thoughtful but a downright pleasant read as well.	2005-07-04

Ward has a nice, clipped, yet thoughtful style that doesn't quite manage to create a distinction between the characters of the doctor and the victim.  Other satellite players  enter and leave this story of loss; but overwhelmingly, there are only the three women taking independent, solitary journeys that converge at the final scene at the Huntsville Prison in south Texas. <br /> <br />The women find ways of reaching peace with their inexplicable losses, but the story is morbid and discouraging.  I was glad for the story to end so I could start another novel.  Ward will likely blossom with experience, and so I recommend keeping a close eye on her future endeavors.	2005-06-26

Children and their monumental effect on the lives of their parents is the theme of this novel--once adults marry and have kids; finding oneself, changing careers, adopting/forsaking religion, etc. become more necessary but infinitely harder to accomplish.    The storyline had a very strange element of the child molester.  I still can't figure out why that was included, except as a means to explore a mother's profound disappointment in her son and her willingness to do virtually anything at any time in her life to help her son.    Children keep us from doing many foolish things, but they also impede us in our ability to change for the better.  Perrotta is an excellent writer, and he has the reader quickly wrapped up in the lives of Sarah and Todd from the first chapter.  I was unhappy with the ending and wish it could've ended more happily, but the final paragraph was so poignant and bittersweet that it almost erased the sadness.  I will definitely consider reading more of Perrotta's work, if this novel is anything by which to judge his skill.	2005-06-22
US	39128555	R2R2VC5PJBUMZI	0446364800	859674593	The General's Daughter	Books	3	12	13	N	N	Too Unwieldy By Half!	I have enjoyed a previous novel or two from Mr. DeMille, but I have to admit being somewhat relieved when this novel finally sputtered to a halt.  The story draws you quickly into the classic murder mystery setting--there is a closed-off, highly conservative community that is rocked when one of its members is killed by one of its anonymous members.  Sex is a predominant theme in the crime, and the detectives find many of the characters have a grave weakness for illicit sex as the investigation into the murder of Captain Ann Campbell proceeds.    The book quickly becomes bogged down by too much detail with description after description of the sort...car A parked 16.2 minutes before car B's tread created a mark near the hoofprint of a deer sighted by a person who slept with the driver of car A's mother.  You don't feel, that when the perpetrator is identified and his/her reasons given, that this was a particularly difficult crime to solve.  There was no aberrant psychology at work, and the ending was predictable.    Although somewhat shallow, the writing is simple and  straightforward.  The same can be said of the characters DeMille draws to lead us through this tale.  DeMille can always be counted on to provide some mixed feelings about the Army, and this book is no exception--that the Army and its personnel are basically sound, if often inefficient, but they doen't interface with reality or civilian life very well.  It's a fun and easy-to-follow story, but you won't put it down after the final page to contemplate the writer's talent or the story's intensity.	2005-06-15

What a pleasure it is to find an author who writes so simpathetically about life, love, loss, and the search for peace and meaning in life. <br /> <br />Any reader who has ever reached a spiritual crisis in her/his life will immediately identify with the humble (but not emasculated) monk who only wants to stay true to himself and his beliefs as he leaves monastic life--ironically, to face being more alone than he ever was in his contemplative existence. <br /> <br />Our heroine is nearing a precipice in her own life, and the arrival of Mike (the monk!) helps her to recognize that she's reaching this crossroads.  His friendship, and ultimately love, give her the courage to choose wisely and with confidence.   <br /> <br />This is a lovely book with gently drawn characters the reader immediately loves.  It manages to be quite serious without our really realizing it, and the comic moments help maintain the light pace Farrington strives for as he takes on the meaning of life and relationships in this charming story.	2005-06-10

Someone enjoys partially incapacitating a victim and stabbing her multiple times while a video camera documents the perversion.  The coup de grace is a wide slash to the throat. <br /> <br />Our heroine, Ms. Stella Mooney, still struggles with Smirnoff and whether or not she should take a chance in love or settle with stable security.  She makes her choice in this novel, and she's human enough to feel a sadness and wrenching pain for the understudy. <br /> <br />Again, as in The Dead Sit Round in a Ring, Lawrence paints a bleak and razor-edged landscape of pillage, carnage, and debauchery in the seedier sections of London.  Certainly, this is one of the highlights of Lawrence's books--his ability to transcribe such a sordid picture of a society debased by the seven deadlies. <br /> <br />His writing is strong, and his characters are all flawed.  We therefore feel the tension in relationships and the desperate futility of the AMIP team members as they track down the truly twisted.  One of my pet peeves in this genre of writing--the serial killer novel--is my feeling that space must be devoted in each story of this kind to a plausible explanation for the SK's psychopathology and modus operandi.  The author acceptably delivers these facts in appropriate places in the story so we can get a clearer picture of the criminal in tandem with Stella et al. <br /> <br />This is a strong entry in the British police procedural genre, and I'm thrilled to know Stella's still out there battling her ghosts and chasing London thugs in a third novel, soon to be available.	2005-05-30

They drink, they smoke, and they spend all their time together--sometimes they cross lines of appropriate behavior for siblings, but they seem happy in their isolated world, wrapped up in each other. <br /> <br />Their oft-absent father's depression and aggression seem to seep into Jack.  And as Jack gets more and more restless, he takes Josie on a ride of selfishness, abuse, and madness.  And yet, somehow, Josie is able to always love Jack in spite of his serious flaws.  Because Josie is mentally healthy, she can't help but envy others in the \\"outside world\\" their healthy relationships and freedom.  How she resolves this conflict within herself is the core of a fascinating and well-written mystery/drama that deserves our attention. <br /> <br />Ms. Braffet writes with a confidence and fluidity that bely her youth.  On the other hand, the reader can truly believe Josie is writing the book, as Kelly Braffet describes the teenage and not -so-teenage thoughts that stream through Josie's mind.  Her writing is thoughtful and well structured; it is fortunately clear from the first pages that the reader will not be insulted by a high-schoolish hack.  The novel is a real page turner, a la John Knowles, and it can be confidently recommended to the discerning reader.	2005-05-21

Our characters are at their finest-Tony Hill with all his quirks and insights, and Carol with all her bossiness and desire to prove how tough she is.  As a writer, McDermid is excellent!  I have no reservations on that score.  Her plotting is solid, believable, and always just a bit frightening (even to a police-procedural aficionado like me). <br /> <br />Unfortunately, I am beginning to tire of the series.  There are a few reasons for this.  First of all, Tony Hill is the only one with any talent on the Jordan-Hill team.  Carol bosses everyone around and enjoys being in authority, but she never seems to have any ideas to make breakthroughs in a case.  Tony is the one who does the thinking and makes the penetrating discoveries that lead to capture and rescue of criminal and victim.  Second, the idea that these two are in love with each other has become incredible since so many novels in which their feelings for each other are clear finish with them in exactly the same platonic position in which we found them in Mermaid Singing.  Third, Ms. McDermid seems determined for her readers to believe every third person or so is homosexual-she consistently seems to push her agenda just a little too much for my taste. <br /> <br />I really can't believe two reasonable adults would not have pursued their relationship past step one.  The series can be rescued, but the characters must have realistic emotional interaction with each other.  Until that occurs, the series will slip into the trite.  Her stand-alone works continue to be outstanding, so I will keep the McDermid flame burning.	2005-05-09

She still isn't British, and sometimes she tries to force some British-isms into her characters' speech to make us gasp in shock that she's really living in some Dallas suburb.  It will never sound quite right, because...well...she's American and should set her mysteries in places she knows something about. <br /> <br />The story is one of those soap-opera types that bore me to tears.  Luscious Greatbod is sleeping with every character in the story; and when she's murdered, everyone could have a motive since they're all her lovers and any one of them could have discovered himself duped. <br /> <br />Ooooo!  But a tragedy during the WWII years has never really been put to rest, has it?!  Let's try to awkwardly braid these storylines together for an explosive conclusion!  Gasp!  It's long, rambling, and so Days of Our Lives.  I'm surprised Victor doesn't make an appearance having fathered one of the characters.... <br /> <br />The heroes, Kincaid and Gemma, say they're lovers but act like normal colleagues.

It is extremely predictable--so much so that it read like a college writing assignment to compose a generic serial killer story. <br /> <br />Paris is the heroine--and of course she's thin (yet buxom), intelligent, feminine, horny, etc, etc, but also tough as nails when she needs to be.  Please excuse me while I vomit.  We have a thoroughly unoriginal sidekick, Gabe.  The killer and his background are corny and unbelievable.  The police could have solved the crime in about a half hour, but Monsour artificially prolongs a showdown and arrest--even though the police know who the murderer is and have appropriate evidence with which to detain him. <br /> <br />Let's spice up this blah story with some sex, shall we?  Monsour has two studs trying to sleep with our heroine throughout the novel; and because she and stud #1 are officially separated (for thoroughly unbelievable reasons), she can enjoy stud #2 with a minimum of guilt.  The final showdown with the killer is as predictable as death and taxes--a 10-year-old could have finished the story after reading the first half. <br /> <br />John Sandford, who writes police procedurals 100 times better than this and is a Twin Cities author, tries to make us think Monsour deserves our attention.

Things went awry at one of the parties years ago; and when the victim's body turns up in a Roman suburbian bog, the police are called in to investigate.  The characters are predictable and trite, and the plot never seems to connect at all the appropriate points.

This novel is comprised of two stories intertwined to make a shocking whole.  First and foremost, Hayder provides a realistic and accurate picture of what the IJA's (Imperial Japanese Army) destruction of Nanking, China must have been like. <br /> <br />Then the second story:  Gray is a young woman who grew up only reading books--her parents did not have a television, nor were there other young people around while Gray was a child.  She was reared on books; and somehow, a rare and terrifying account of Japan's genocide in Nanking comes under her intelligent adolescent scrutiny. <br /> <br />She becomes obsessed with viewing a film that shows torture and murder perpetuated by a perverse monster in the IJA--the Devil of Nanking.  She finds help in Tokyo from the elderly man who brought the film back from China back in late 1937.  Eventually, we as readers get the portrayal of Nanking's destruction through snippets from the elderly man's journal as well as by information Gray gleans while privately investigating as a \\"hostess\\" in a Tokyo nightclub. <br /> <br />This was well worth reading.

The story is set in the classic innocent-man-framed style, and its pacing is brisk enough to keep our interest right up to the last pages.  We can surely sympathize with the main character, who has recently been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease--but one of the messes in which our hero finds himself is of his own making, and I had a hard time sympathizing with his wayward step. <br /> <br />I admit to being a little angry with Robotham's anti-Bush jibes.  His main character makes a comment about a character who doesn't look like he belongs in a certain office--\\"like seeing George W. Bush in the White House.\\"  He also mentions, much later in the novel, a list of terrible events in recent world history--and right after mentioning the Twin Towers disaster, he mentions the mistreatment of terrorist prisoners in Abu Girabe.  How does the murder of thousands of people equate with our soldiers' taking a few humiliating pictures? <br /> <br />If he can't keep his liberal sneers out of his novels, I'll have a hard time considering him as a British author worthy of my time and attention.	2005-04-24

When his ex-girlfriend is murdered in the States, he finds himself trying to find her murderer without the status of police officer or even licensed PI. <br /> <br />The writing is fair, and McKinty makes us like Lawson in spite of Lawson's multitude of pretty serious errors in judgement that have nearly ruined his life.  The problem with the plot is that it's quite simple to identify the perpetrator very early in the story.  The motive is mundane and predictable, and the resolution is dilute and somewhat sterile.	2005-04-09

This was a fun book to read--Linda Wallander is clearly going to be like her father Kurt in many respects now that she's begun her career as a police officer on the Ystad force. <br /> <br />Kurt is still the lonely old bear he's always been.  He's lovable because he tries so hard to do the right thing as a police officer and as a father.  Like so many regular people, however, he falls short much of the time.  His pride and joy is his daughter Linda, and he's guardedly excited she'll be a junior member on the force he leads. <br /> <br />Mankell's writing is thoughtful, and his characters are so like the co-workers and neighbors we ourselves deal with on a daily basis.  His writing is such that you can feel the tension between the characters when it develops; you can feel the ice-cold wind blow across the coast of southern Sweden; and you can sense the auditory hallucinations that tell the criminals in his novels to do the ghastly crimes Wallander must solve.  There is a sparseness and loneliness that pervades Mankell's books, but they somehow avoid being depressing and maudlin. <br /> <br />I have read all of Mankell's mysteries, and this is a strong entry into his body of work.  If you're a big Kurt Wallander fan (as we all come to be--those of us who've read those novels), don't be disappointed thinking it's only about his daughter.  He's a major player throughout this book, and I was relieved to find out he'll likely be in subsequent books so we can find out if he ever finds a nice woman to keep him warm during the Swedish winters.	2005-04-06

I really appreciate Greg Iles' writing--this novel is a great showcase of his ability to deftly weave a thrilling plot into an   isolated small town in the South--Natchez, Mississippi.  Something Iles is especially good at is giving the story a good villain.  In these small towns, it seems, the rich control who gets what jobs, who gets fired, who marries whom, who becomes mayor, who gets re-elected, etc.  Power corrupts absolutely, and these Suth-uhn gentlemen end up committing all kinds of atrocities behind the doors of their mahogany-paneled study. <br /> <br />Penn Cage wants to find out who murdered Del Payton, a black man murdered in a car bomb explosion in 1968.  Cage's reasons are multifold, but he pursues this interesting case that was hushed up so many years ago because the man he suspects of masterminding the murder hurt Cage's family many years ago.  Cage also had an all-consuming relationship with this man's daughter--she has returned to town after not speaking to cage for years, and she seems ready to seduce him back into her life.  Why she left it so suddenly and why she's suddenly back are questions to which Cage needs answers.  <br /> <br />There's lying, shooting, punching, and lovin' in this story, but none of it is gratuitous or overplayed.  Iles projects his interesting theories of why race problems still exist in the South, and his protagonist is an upstanding man we can admire and root for as the forces of the good ole boy network conspire to silence him and hurt his family. <br /> <br />Try this book!  Iles is an excellent writer, and you're yanked into the plot from the first pages.  The story is believable, and the crimes Cage attempts to solve are truly despicable.  I felt the ending to be not as explosive as it could have been, but that is a trifle in an otherwise fantastic novel!	2005-04-03

I couldn't stop reading it the moment I started, and I am much too snobbish (I'd like to say I'm \\"discerning\\") to say that except in rare instances.  Blood Memory is a mystery and a work of fiction carefully intertwined with glimpses of a South gone by and the most horrible crimes a human being can perpetrate against another. <br /> <br />Catherine Ferry is a forensic odontologist (bite-mark expert) who suffers from alcoholism and other self-destructive behaviors--she has enough of a grip on reality to hold down her job as an expert in her field, but only just.  When a series of execution-style murders swiftly plagues New Orleans, Cat can't seem to focus her skills on the bite-marked victims.  Shadows of her past cloud her mind, and she must return to her childhood home in Natchez, Mississippi to recuperate and try to apprehend what is preventing her from functioning properly at a crime scene. <br /> <br />What she finds at home is even more horrible than the killings in New Orleans.  As she wanders back over a trail of sorrow and blood from her family's past, she finds the key to solving the murders taking place in Louisiana. <br /> <br />The writing is excellent!  It's clear Mr. Iles puts plenty of thought into each paragraph, and he doesn't just tell a story with pages and pages of terse dialogue (as do so many authors of the modern mystery novel)--he lets his characters breathe and develop as the story snakes its way to a shocking and satisfying conclusion. <br /> <br />This novel by Mr. Iles certifies his place as the top writer from Mississippi--John Grisham can't hold a candle to the writing, depth, and humanity that permeate this novel.  I would unhesitatingly recommend this to anyone.  If she or he is not a mystery fan (or at least a police procedural fan), they will investigate the genre after finishing Blood Memory.  Instead of donating this book to the library, I'm going to keep this one on the bookshelf to lend to others and re-read.  Find this one any way you can and devour it--you won't regret it!	2005-03-26

The first half of the book seemed like the typical American police procedural--this time set in San Diego.  The murders are ghastly, and the subset of individuals who seems to be the chosen victims adds another disturbing twist to the story.  Our hero, Seamus Moynihan, is a narcissist and is somewhat hard to like.  He's a jock, good with the ladies, drives a muscle car, and spews testosterone in every interaction with another living thing, etc. <br /> <br />Once Moynihan travels to rural Alabama--that's when things get interesting.  The deeper he seems to go into those dense, humid forests looking for the house where a tragedy took place 27 years ago (and may be the key to solving the string of San Diego murders), the eerier the story. <br /> <br />The ending is somewhat predictable, but the psychology of the criminal's behavior is plausible enough to warrant our suspension of reality to enjoy a spooky, disturbing police procedural.	2005-03-15

His knack for portraying the streets and characters of shady Edinburg is really fascinating.  Along with that great atmosphere and diaglogue of Scotland, watching Rebus continue to buck the police system that he can't live with or without is always intertaining. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Rankin's books are getting longer and less interesting.  Rebus' character isn't evolving, and I find myself more interested in what Shiobahn is up to.  These characters are so likable, and they certainly need to have relationships to round them out as individuals. <br /> <br />While still a fun read, Rankin could cut the length by a third.  He should inject more substance and development into his characters, and the plot and pacing must be more focused.	2005-03-15

Since the death of her husband, she's been a bit of a loose cannon--and for that, she loses custody of her teenage niece and her job.  She fights back, albeit gradually, against these setbacks and eventually joins the LVPD in its pursuit of an elusive serial killer. <br /> <br />On the plus side:  the characters are believable, tastefully flawed, and likable.  The insight into autism injected into the narrative is not overbearing, and it adds pathos to the typical Dr. Watson character that is almost ubiquitous to stories of this kind.  The writing is fair, and the pacing is smooth and natural.  Lastly--in a genre filled with all sorts of horrible crimes, the antagonist in this story still comes up with some torture methods that elicit a visceral response. <br /> <br />On the minus side:  It's a bit predictable with a final showdown that seems highly improbable.  One of my biggest complaints against books of this type is when the motives behind the criminal's deeds are farfetched and contrived.  I just don't think someone would get this delusional about a particular author and start mimicking fictional crimes--yet still have a regular job where no one suspects he/she has a lair where all sorts of terrors are inflicted on unsuspecting vicims. <br /> <br />If you're on a plane, give this one a read.  It'll keep your attention.  If you're looking for something a bit more intellectual, try Val McDermid or Denise Mina.	2005-03-03

Your novel was so tough to put down, and the writing was excellent--so much better than most of the tripe American authors slap down on a page.  Your heroine was wonderful, and her hint of decadence made us like her more since it was surrounded by her innate goodness, conservatism, and family orientation.<br /><br />Particularly arresting was that moment when Lora sees Alice looking through the family photo album late at night--your description of Alice's expression was truly haunting and secured me as a fan of your writing.<br /><br />You were able to elicit from your phrasing a dense, murky atmosphere that felt so real.  I felt like I was in southern California in the early '60s every time I picked up the book to continue reading of Lora's, Bill's, and Alice's tale.<br /><br />The characterization of Alice was gripping.  Just when she's \\"arrived\\", she realizes she can't quite (and doesn't even want to) give up her sordid past.  Your description of how she can keep up her public face 99 percent of the time makes the 1 percent appearance of the dark Alice all the more scary.<br /><br />I can't wait for your next novel!.  I'll definitely read it because this one was so thoughtful and different.	2005-03-03

This story is good from several aspects, the best being his realistic portrayal of psychosis and psychological illness.  He is not a journalist of the 20/20 variety trying to get it right--he's got the knowledge and experience to make the details believable.  Kellerman is a nice narrator, and he has some characters we can really root for--Detective Sturgis, Alex himself, and the true victim in this story, Jamey. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this book is twice as long as it needs to be.  You can skim so many paragraphs that don't contribute to character or plot development--you know, all the times Dr. Delaware goes to feed his fish, or the descriptions of some tract of houses off some California freeway. <br /> <br />In the end, the plot is fairly contrived.  The final scene has all the suspects in the same room.  The villain is unmasked, those characters we thought were benign turn out to be malignant,  a few gunshots ring out--but just who shot who?!!  The plot is also implausible as well.  If you sit down and summarize how the bad guy(s) pulled off the plot, it seems pretty silly. <br /> <br />All in all, it's a pretty good read, but it's an early enough effort to still have significant drawbacks.  Delaware sure is a nice guy, though!	2005-02-19

I figured the novel would be complex, accurate, and fast paced.  Although a bit simple, it did not disappoint me. <br /> <br />Liz is a mid-level agent runner for MI-5, and she gets a disturbing image that a terror threat from militant jihadists could explode on British soil.  To make matters worse for MI-5, the attack is aided and abetted by an \\"invisible\\" (a native or near-native of the country or ethnic group being attacked).  Liz and her co-workers must work around the clock to discover the who, when, where, why, and how regarding this attack. <br /> <br />The book is fairly well written, and the pacing is brisk.  The plot was a bit simple--there are no subplots, relationship tensions between intelligence officers, etc.  The above paragraph describes the storyline pretty much in its entirety.  It does seem to be realistic, and Liz is a very likable protagonist.  I really hope Rimington will continue to develop as a writer in the modern espionage fiction genre, and it'd be fun to see more of Liz (and maybe a deepening of the relationship with her boss?).	2005-02-12

Our heroine, who narrates the entire story in a pleasant, straightforward prose, is Robin Ballantyne--a single, stay-at-home mom since the birth of her twins one year ago.  She longs to return to her BBC documentary-making job; and somewhat strangely, it's a mysterious tragedy literally right outside her window that gives her the impetus to charge ahead with the next stage in her life. <br /> <br />Ms. Sampson is a natural storyteller, and Ms. Ballantyne is a likable protagonist we can root for--beaten down by the world and struggling to stay afloat, she still has an underdog's spunk that makes us root for her as someone close to her is carefully framing her for her ex-lover's murder. <br /> <br />The plot is well structured and has the ring of plausability to it.  The hardboiled DCI Finney could come from any number of books in this genre, but it helps Robin to have his common sense off which she can bounce her ideas.  In short, the plot, characters, and writing style are very good.  I strongly recommend this novel and look forward to Ms. Sampson's next novel.	2005-02-02

Jane's just a bit too brash and annoying to make the reader sympathize with the protagonist.<br /><br />The plot is not quite believable, and the villain, when revealed, is a surprise--but she/he is such a minor character as to render the I-never-would-have-guessed factor somewhat artificial.  Dr. Gerritsen has a nice story-telling writing style, and her characters for the most part are likable and human.  Their vulnerabilities help bring them closer to the reader's level, and it makes a series of novels possible and interesting.<br /><br />I guess my main objection to this novel is the plot.  It just doesn't seem believable, and it doesn't grab you with its teeth and refuse to let you go.  Gerritsen is capable of such storytelling, and I hope her next installment in the series takes us back to such edgy plots.	2005-01-23

An obstetrician is too caught up in work and justifies his inappropriate lifestyle by saying \\"my patients need me--my first responsibility is to them.\\"  In reality, he seems to have not discovered a reasonable balance between the amount of work he takes on and the time he should spend with his family. <br /> <br />As is wont to occur, when a sensitive member of a relationship is ignored for long enough, she/he will seek companionship with another individual.  Ms. Brundage casts an appropriate shadow of foreboding over the overzealous Christians and on the character of the artist's wife.  In reality, she is the much more tortured and interesting character (as opposed to the doctor's wife). <br /> <br />The book is mired in pedantry!  Ms. Brundage gets much too caught up in telling us that anti-abortionists are terrible people who are too self-righteous to realize they are harming more people than are those doctors who perform abortions.  Any half-enlightened individual would realize, Ms. Brundage seems to say, that abortion is a tough decision, but it must exist.  It's a necessity for society. <br /> <br />Don't try so hard, Ms. Brundage!  You can do it without the speeches.	2005-01-23

Three kindergarten-aged girls are found murdered near an isolated San Francisco commune.  Are the children the target of a violent pedophile, or is a complex frame being set up to rid the commune of one of its members? <br /> <br />King writes well, and her eclectic educational and life background makes her characters believable and likable.  I felt, however, that her streak of feminism detracts from her novel.  Her homosexual homily taints an otherwise interesting plot and finely chiseled characters.  Also unfortunate is King's understating the climax such that the suspense she works so hard to develop in the earlier sections of the novel is diminished. <br /> <br />This is a series King continues with subsequent novels; but as it becomes apparent that the series will continue to be part mystery and part in-your-face-I'm-a-coming-out-lesbian, I think I'll stop with the first book in what is otherwise a probably fun series starring Kate Martinelli.	2005-01-02

Hart does a good job of painting the grim landscape of boggy Ireland to the reader, and it's obvious she has a passion for the history and artistry of her Irish ancestors. <br /> <br />The writing flows smoothly and keeps the reader engaged throughout a series of murders involving garrotting, ancient daggers, and quicksand-like drownings.  The plot is somewhat predictable, and Nora's relationship with her lover seems underdeveloped.  She clearly is in love with him, yet she still plays high-schoolish games with \\"why we can't be together now.\\" <br /> <br />There's a bit of soap opera in this book--the beautiful, dark-haired lass who cannot/will not speak because of a witnessed tragedy; mistaken paternity; surprise pregnancy, etc.  The villain kills wantonly, but when he/she must get vital information from Nora Gavin, he/she spares her.  Doesn't seem too likely! <br /> <br />The climax is a little embarrassing in its theatrical quality, but at least the bad guy/gal gets justice in the end.  It's a fun little read; and I believe that with experience, Ms. Hart will be able to form more complex characters and imbue her plots with more pschological depth than is present in Lake of Sorrows.	2004-12-27

Ben, our hero, is a small-town police chief in a Maine village.  He's young and intelligent, and he's never realized his full potential in a town so quiet that a broken pool cue is the biggest crime of the year.  So when Boston ADA Robert Danziger's body is found several days after a gunshot wound to the head on his patch, Ben takes the opportunity to get swept up in a big-city gangster killing. <br /> <br />He learns much about himself in the process--by his actions during the case, his relationship to the victim and other members of the investigating team, and from a retired police officer who sees Ben's potential as a thoughtful enforcer of the law. <br /> <br />Landay's writing flows easily and is uncomplicated.  However, just when you're breezing along with Ben through the bullet-ridden streets of Mission Flats or walking along the shores of a Maine lake in autumn, you'll run across a passage that is truly sublime.  I'd quote it here, but I can't do it justice--you'll just have to run across it when you read the book--it's a description of a family's suffering as the mother slowly deteriorates from Alzheimer's disease.  The story is written in a narrative style that is engrossing and engaging.  Landay's just getting warmed up as a suspense writer, and I sincerely look forward to his next effort.	2004-12-18

Manda Scott easily fits on the team of Scottish female suspense authors captained by Val McDermid.  Her writing is thoughtful, straightforward, and laced with just a touch of melancholy.

Wozencraft exposes us to a world most of us never knew or even imagined--the blurry lines between the good guys and the bad guys in the war on drugs. <br /> <br />What makes this novel so disturbing is its ring of authenticity; its truthtelling grows until they final pages, when the moral of the story is exposed:  1) situational ethics applies in settings where it is morally wrong yet sanctioned by the law; 2) life is often not fair, and the evil often prosper. <br /> <br />Her writing skills are excellent, and her ability to write expertly about these complex situations in the first person makes the novel intense and almost too painful to continue.  She has real ability, although I'm not sure I want to read about such a depressing and sordid world about which she writes so capably.	2004-11-28

It is probably the best legal thriller ever written, bar none.  But that's his Dreamweaver--his one-hit wonder.  He just never seemed to pull all the right pieces together to make another book like it.  What follows is my review of a rather average legal mystery: <br /> <br />Three people are shot and killed and put in the freezer; a man is convicted and sentenced to die.  Asked by the court to defend the accused, Arthur Raven discovers a passion for defense law of which he wasn't aware in his world of civil litigation. <br /> <br />As usual, Turow's technical prowess shines again--there's nothing like a practicing attorney to get the details right (or at least believable) in the legal proceedings that highlight this book. <br /> <br />The problem with the novel is not the writing, which is certainly better than average.  The problem is that I found I didn't care who did it.  Is the accused really the one who killed those people?  He's a schizophrenic with a criminal record whose cerebral cortex is a glob of melted crayons--but is he a killer?  We are introduced to a few other losers who act as though they might be the true killers.  But who cares?   <br /> <br />We the readers can't find much sympathy for any of the suspects for the murders--they're all bums.  It's hard to care whether the accused really gets freed from prison.  The novel is much too long, and you find yourself flipping ahead to see how long to the end.  You keep hoping the suspense will rise and peak at some point, but it never really does. <br /> <br />On the plus side:  not only is there good writing and legal accuracy, there is real insight into the lives of those who care for loved ones with schizophrenia.   <br /> <br />Read Presumed Innocent and pass this one by.  Turow's got real talent, but we're waiting for it to shoot through the surface of his mundane subsequent efforts.	2004-11-25

The loathesome crimes make your skin crawl, and the ruthlessness of the  criminals is unmatched.  McCarthy's plot is well crafted, and the characters grab you into their world of lies, blackmail, and sex. <br /> <br />His writing...ah! his writing.  This is the sort of novel that makes you stop every few pages or so to read a sentence or paragraph out loud to the person you're sitting next to.  The medical-based plot is clearly explained; although my science background makes my description of its clarity somewhat suspect. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the fact that his characters are named after famous people in medicine--Eisenmenger, a famous German cardiologist; Flem(m)ing, the discoverer of penicillin; Bochdalek, the physician who described a type of diaphragmatic hernia, etc.  Even the names of some of the companies described in the plot are named after famous syndromes (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, etc). <br /> <br />It's wonderful to find a new author, especially one of McCarthy's talents.  One caveat--read his first novel starring Eisenmenger and Flemming--A Feast of Carrion--first since a great deal of information about why our protagonists have the nightmares they have comes from this first book.  Also, some spoilers are present in the second book that make reading the first one slightly less surprising.  A great thriller--find it and read it!	2004-11-21

Devlin's characterizations are strong; and the main characters, though familiar in their outlines, have enough nuances to make them individual and three dimensional. <br /> <br />The writing is very insightful, and Devlin's analysis of the complexities of relationships is spot on target.  The antagonists are real, with such tragic bends in their psyches as to render them pitiable while at the same time revolting.  The backdrop in San Francisco is a nice change from so many stories of this type set in NYC.  Devlin is an excellent writer and storyteller, and I eagerly await his next novel--hoping it's a continuation of the relationship between Rose, Joshua, Seamus, and murder.	2004-11-18

Never a good sign, I was skimming the last pages so I could see that I had indeed correctly predicted the \\"terrifying\\" last sequence of events. <br /> <br />I can understand why the author writes under a pseudonym--this stuff is two dimensional; and I have to disagree with some of the other reviewers here, the characters are so trite!  I really believe someone gave David Cray an outline of the usual police procedural/serial killer story. <br /> <br />The brash-yet-secretly-sensitive woman detective is boss over the men.  She is attractive and quite young for her elevated position in the police heirarchy.  She is rearing a top-notch child even though she's never home and living in a dangerous city. <br /> <br />The melancholy, attractive, forty-something man who \\"breaks the rules\\" and is permitted into the aforementioned woman's realm.  He dedicates his life to righting the wrongs of a mysterious past...blah blah blah. <br /> <br />So predictable is the serial killer's wanting to kidnap the detective's husband, wife, child, etc. at the end of the novel.  This was so boring!  There are so many authors who breathe excitement and depth into their plots and characters!  Don't settle for this tripe!  This would bore you even on a short airline flight! <br /> <br />This book would be interesting and gripping to someone who reads a book a year--usually when she or he is unable to watch television.  If you read more than that, you're bound to recognize just how similar the plot devices and characters are to many other medium-grade books being written!  Unflatteringly, we North Americans have to read UK authors to see some quality writing and psychological suspense.  Word to the wise--skip this one.	2004-11-14
US	39128555	R1LENQN149YPDA	0316735922	974258049	Deception: A Novel	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Very Intelligent Thriller	Denise Mina really is top notch.  She and Val McDermid continue to write complex psychological thrillers centered around characters who are substantive and believable. <br /> <br />Deception is no exception.  Although I enjoy the Maureen series that started with Garnethill, this is a welcome stand-alone novel that reminds us that every mind and every spirit is complicated, sometimes duplicitous, and capable of fluid change. <br /> <br />At the end of the novel, you're marveling that you didn't see it coming.  I, for one, had to stop and think about the chain of events to make sure I knew everyone's motives and reasons for their reactions to a series of gruesome murders. <br /> <br />My only reservation is the likability of the main character.  He's maudlin, and it's tiring to hear him ruminate about his depressing situation, even though it's a fascinating conundrum to which he's forced to respond.  Overall, it's an excellent psychological thriller, and one that is 100 percent absorbing from the moment the reader opens to the first page.	2004-11-09
US	39128555	R15OOP2HG9SRBM	0743451562	550790495	Icarus	Books	2	2	4	N	N	Interesting But Implausible	It's never a good sign if I start another novel while I'm more than halfway through another novel.  This unfortunately pertains to Icarus.  There's just a little too many soap opera-type twists in the plot to keep my interest.  And \\"Kid\\"?  Having all these super-gorgeous women willing to kill to have him all to themselves?  Not believable either.  And calling them throughout the novel by nicknames?  Annoying--and I just didn't buy it. <br /> <br />Andrews has a nice narrative style, and the hero tracking down all the possible suspects at the end was interesting and compelling.  The above items just detracted from an interesting plot.  Perhaps the most crucial flaw in the novel is the murderer.  When she/he is revealed, it's just not believable that this character could be the one responsible for all the mayhem of the novel.  The key to any psychological suspense is credible reasons why the antagonist would engage in such horrific behavior.  Icarus is interesting, but it just doesn't work.	2004-11-08

This is an excellent police procedural written by an Australian author of whom I'd never heard.  His main character, Challis, is the classic haunted, somewhat melancholy, yet very-advanced-in-rank-for-his-age detective.  In spite of loneliness, a barren, dry summer, and a milktoast superior, he treats his fellow officers, witnesses, and suspects with respect and understanding. <br /> <br />The setting is different from the NYC- or London-based crime thrillers--and the change in atmosphere is refreshing and adds to the atmosphere as both the summer heat and the townspeople's anxiety over a serial killer in their midst intensifies.  The characters are carefully drawn and unique, ignoring the temptation to toss us the usual typecasts in a novel of this kind.  Those who enjoy this genre will be happy to discover a great veteran author to explore.	2004-10-16

When you finish this one, and Hayder's equally enthralling previous novel Birdman, you'll come away thrilled (and asking when another Hannibal book will be coming our way). <br /> <br />I've been trying to think of an articulate way to describe why the Mo Hayder books stand out as scarier and more disturbing than other talented authors writing crime fiction today.  I can't seem to do it.  They just ooze a sense of uneasiness--about the main character detective, about the crimes committed, and about the motives of those characters close to our protagonist. <br /> <br />Hayder's criminals are perfectly portrayed--they are clearly sociopathic and twisted in ways no sane person can comprehend.  Their proclivities are so original and horrifying--and yet the killers are not smugly laughing at the police and chasing down the main character like in so many more predictable novels.  They are barely functioning misfits and outcasts, and their crimes are unique and disturbing.   <br /> <br />I can't wait for the next installment in the series, and I'm excited about the U.S. release of Hayder's latest novel, Tokyo.	2004-10-09

Lawrence's plotting is dark, textured, and laced with tales of the seedy underworld of London's crime scene.  This first book in a (hopefully!) series starring Stella Mooney is well thought out and consistently gripping--the end is believable without being predictable. <br /> <br />If you like British police procedurals, like Val McDermid, Ian Rankin, Mo Hayder, and Denise Mina, then this will be an author to add to your list of fun authors to watch.	2004-10-09

Our main character is not a police officer wrangling against prejudiced superiors and nasty street thugs to find the criminal--he's a criminal himself.  As a criminal, his Camus-like approach to life and relationships make this character hard to like and believe.  Lindsay clearly has a knack for comedy and sarcasm, and Dexter is a perfect voice to add color to an otherwise shallow plot. <br /> <br />The other characters are very flat and trite.  The plot doesn't really work, and there's a touch of made-for-TV twists in the story that make the reader a bit embarrassed that Lindsay didn't think this one through more thoroughly.  I won't be likely to read the next installment in the series.	2004-10-09

It was one of those situations where I couldn't put the book down, even though there were other things I should have been doing that day. <br /> <br />The book wasn't perfect, but the characters were real, the writing strong, the history compelling, and the mood chilling.  Granted, some of the science is pretty shaky toward the end--but that didn't detract at all from an exciting read.  Read the first 50 pages and judge for yourself.  The last several chapters have very believable plot twists and turn your assumptions upside down.  Great read!	2004-09-26

Unfortunately the ending RUINED my enjoyment of this book.  Things seemed as though they were about to end in a somber yet placid way, and then Wilson botched it.  There will always be those who don't mind a sad ending, especially if the tale was already grim in nature and subject.  There will, I'm sure, always be a percentage of us for whom such an ending will make us less likely to read that author again.	2004-07-26

Her psychological material is carefully researched and propels the plot along at a brisk pace. <br />Her writing continues to soar above most of her peers, and the relationship between the two protagonists keeps the reader coming back for book after book.  Well done!	2004-06-27
US	39128555	RKI7MAKO6MMIB	0671511092	602975638	Deviant Way	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Entertaining, But Shallow	Jack Paris was interesting, but as a main character, he seemed predictable.  The story was engaging without giving us a clear picture of why someone would engage in such horrific acts.<br />I think this plot was very well thought out, but the author fails to provide enough detail for us to understand the demons that would lead someone to commit these crimes.  The reader is left unsure of exactly who did what to whom, as if Montanari was told he only had five pages to wrap up the story.  It shows a lot of promise for future endeavors.  Good debut thriller by a veteran writer.	2004-06-27

The hero, Alex Delaware, seems to have no psychology practice obligations other than doing detective/police-procedural work for Milo Sturgis.  That's just fine, but it makes Delaware's character seem more unremarkable and superficial.  The criminal's reasoning for perpetrating his mayhem and his modus operandi are only moderately convincing.<br />This book is 3/5 stars because it's fun with a few minor hangups.  It can easily be put down and picked up again, and you won't get any goosebumps or harrowing realizations from the plot.	2004-06-12
US	39128555	RTI0GBY6KUDOF	0060083263	624926035	Sleeping Beauty (Margolin, Phillip)	Books	2	4	9	N	N	Mediocre Effort	I admit I am dismayed to see so many people rave about Margolin's latest novel, Sleeping Beauty.  I admire the plotting and technique of Mo Hayder, Denise Mina, and Val McDermid--this book is slick, superficial, and undeserving.  <br />The characters are two dimensional.  The writing is simple, with very few alterations in a short, high-schoolish sentence structure.  For readers familiar with this genre, the villain(s) of the story are easily identified--and early on in the narrative.  It is almost painful to trudge along with Margolin through the midsection of the book, knowing at any minute a contrived plot twist will burst upon the scene.<br />Like many American authors of popular fiction, the writing is of poor quality.  Most of the text is short, terse dialogue (the worst practitioner of which is Catherine Coulter), and any paragraph longer than two sentences seems added in as an afterthought to lend &quot;substance&quot; and &quot;atmosphere&quot; to an unremarkable plot.  This can't have taken long to write for a man with as much education and experience as Phillip Margolin.  Skip this one!	2004-05-31

The psychology involved in the Distant Echo crimes and the psychology of the characters' responses to the crimes never fails to be satisfying.  This book finds her in great form--this is just as good as Place of Execution, arguably her best work.<br />Ms. McDermid has a real forte in carefully layering the melancholy atmosphere of a winter murder in Fife, Scotland.  Her characters are believable and likable.  The plot is superb and complex.  Halfway through the book, the reader already feels like she/he has enjoyed a great novel of suspense.  Happily, that's only the first half of the book!<br />I feel comfortable recommending this novel to even the most discerning reader.  <br />One of my dislikes concerning the works of Ms. McDermid is a determination to promote her particular brand of feminism and homosexuality.  There are short passages that are dedicated, or so it seems, solely to making a statement on those issues.  Just a little too pedantic for my taste.  This is certainly a minor matter, but I think her characters would come across as more evenhanded if she were to temper that trend.<br />Overall an outstanding novel!	2004-03-08
