This is a book that is not obsessed with methodolgy or mystery but examines the character at the heart of the event.  Kauffman's Booth is a more human, more interesting, and more nefarious character than suggested by his usual reduction to 'deranged actor' or 'unbalanced actor.'  Kauffman's analysis of the conspiracy trial is more balanced and interesting than the contemporary assumption that it was entirely a railroad job by the government.	2005-02-03

It is another example of how genius moves to its own rhythms and manages to get noticed in spite of itself.  <BR>Turing is, more than anyone else, the father of the modern computer, a man who could visualize something which did not even exist.  It was his vision that eventually came to be the most powerful innovation in the last half century.  Hodges book explores Turing's entire life and illuminates the context in which apparently arcane and irregular thinking came to have profound ramifications at the right moment and time.	2004-07-09

But, although the capability for the 'paperless' office is here, the office itself isn't.  This is because printed material is still the most versatile way for people to use and handle.  <BR>Online helps and references are sometimes like mazes, in that you chase a topic in a big circle until you get back to the beginning.  They are great for overview and organization, lousy for hunting specifics.  In addition, unless you have a laptop, you can't curl up in bed and read.  <BR>While it's true that everything in the printed reference is already in online help I've always found it convenient to also acquire the printed documentation.  It's easier to park a specific page open and refer to it than to hop from one screen to another.  Snippets of example code serve to illustrate the practical implementations of various C# elements.	2003-10-21

People familiar with cars and houses can readily gauge the space of a house or the size of a car by looking at pictures. But aircraft, for instance, are difficult to imagine in photographs except for pilots.  I was surprised when I finally saw a real B17 that it was not quite as huge and massive as I had imagined.  <BR>Spacecraft are very difficult for people to understand because they rarely see a real one.  It's impossible for someone to grasp the Saturn V unless they visit one of the few remaining artifcacts on display.  The conical and cylindrical design of the Apollo capsule made it hard for people to fathom exactly how it was layed out inside.  In addition spacecraft are the most densely packed devices made with an incredible amount of apparatus stuffed inside them.  <BR>This ingenious book finally slices open the Apollo Command &amp; Service modules in a colorful and revealing way so that even the average person can quickly grasp it's design and the way it looked.  <BR>In addition the book shows in detail exactly how it worked and how it all fitted together.  <BR>This book is a must have article for any Apollo buff.	2003-10-21

But I was surprised to find the topic not as daunting as I thought although people who lock up when they see formulas may be intimidated at first glance.  This book deals with number theory, dealing with some fundamental properties of numbers with application to cryptographic uses.  Each section takes you slowly through the theory and provides exercises at the end of each chapter you can work through.  (The answers are in the back of the book.)  This is a particularly useful book if you are conversant in programming and want to play with certain aspects of number theory and cryptography to 'see how it really works.'  It's like a course in tumblers and pins for someone who is fascinated by locks.	2003-04-24

It debunks some accepted wisdoms such as that the Luftwaffe never considered a long range strategic bomber.  It shows with stark clarity that the Reich was barely ready in an industrial sense for the war they ended up fighting, which was not the war they foresaw.  The battle in toto was a war of attrition between two industrial powers and in the end the American and Allied industrial base smothered the Reich's industrial base.	2003-04-24

In addition the entire area and its relentless climate took a toll on pilots and equipment.  <br />Often thought of as a carrier war, Bergerud reminds us this is not so.  After battering each other in 1942 both sides withdrew their carriers for two years before they squared off again.  The Pacific air war was primarily a battle between land based planes.  <br />It was a weird theater where enough square feet to put a runway was the limit of control of an island otherwise useless with impenetrable jungle and malarial swamps.  The ferocity of the fight for these fringe patches, such as Guadalcanal, was horrific.  <br />Bergerud adds depth and detail to his account, dwelling on each important aspect of the war, and showing how the Allies were more formidable than assumed, fighting at first with obsolete aircraft.  <br />This book is fine addition to any World War II Library and a must for students of the air war.	2003-02-09

It also demonstrates how the wrong decisions before a war can defeat you before you even fight.  <br />Williamson debunks some common assumptions, such as the belief that the Germans never grasped the importance of a strategic bomber, they did, but other factors prevented them from realizing it.  <br />With authoritative statistics Williamson proves that Germany was not ready for war in 1939 and the war became a type of war they had not prepared for.  It was not the failure of her pilots or machines that defeated them but the failure of German leaders to insure they had an adequate industrial production capability before fighting.  <br />The Luftwaffe's early victories nonetheless cost them equipment and in 1942 when Hitler stalled in Russia the war came down to who could best replace their losses and it was a battle the Germans lost for all their ingenuity in other areas.  <br />This is an illuminating book about the real equation in the European Air War.	2003-02-09

Exceptional engineers in private industry had to figure out how to solve the daunting challenges of going to the moon and produce the actual article.

Mostly all that could be found were references to  this type of weapon but little information.  McDowell's book fills a  longstanding void about this transitional era in firearms between  percussion and cartridge.   This is a definitive work with substantial  documentation that resolves what is an inherently confusing topic.  These  types of revolvers are being made now with the growth in Cowboy Action  Shooting and shooters are always avidly interested in the history of their  weapons.   This is a plethora of photographs and diagrams which resolves  the sequence of development of these types of arms in such a way that the  student of these arms can get a full understanding of their circumstances  of development.
