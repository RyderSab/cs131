Finkel contacts Longo when he is returned to the U.S. and put in jail, and correspondance and phone calls flow from there.   <br />Both Finkel (the writer) and Longo (the murderer) have personality disorders, in this reviewer's opinion.  Finkel tends to be unrepentant about his faults and blames others for his shortcomings, as does Longo.   <br />What bothers me is that there does not seem to be a motive for what Finkel did (falsify a story) or Longo did (murder his family).  A horribly true story but fascinating.	2005-08-04

It is hard to beleive that parents can be this cruel, and can consciously choose an abusive relationship over the love of a child.  I wonder what happened to the biological Father of Ursula, who named his child so that she would have USA for initials, and why the Mother couldn't have just sent Ursula to live with him.  The Mother and the boyfriend were not punished enough.   <br />Pictures would have really added to the story.	2005-07-12

She had no redeming features in the book and functioned only on greed.  <br />It was riveting from start to finish.   <br />I felt so sorry for Mr. Beard's children, being deprived of their Father, who surely had several more years on this earth if Celeste's had not plotted with others to kill him.   <br />Ms. Casey obviously got a lot of cooperation from the people involved in the story to get so much detail.

It is very obvious who was willing to be interviewed by the author and who was not (namely, Dr. Scher and his wife Pat Dillon Scher). I guess they felt they would come out worse than they already do in the story.  This book has been one of the saddest true crime stories I have ever read.

I liked the fact that it read like a mystery.  <br />One of the reviewers said that the main character, David Spence, was telling the truth about not being involved in the murders, and that the police officer who is convinced of his guilt is the actual liar.

This is a intriguing account of one episode of munchausen's syndrome by proxy that was mistaken for sleep apnea/sids for years, until it was uncovered.

Overall, this was a very good book about a subject that I find depressing to read about (munchausen syndrome by proxy).  Their was not enought information given about the background of the main character Tanya Reid, in my opinion, and too much detail was given to describing the lead prosecuting attorney's background (which I did not care about). However it is still a very interesting story, and a tragic one.	2005-06-28

It is very difficult to catogorize as evidenced by the other book reviews.  It is a love story, social commentary, extremely political novel that requires concentration when reading.   <br />Only one person has given this book a bad review, and he has a good point.  The different chapters that are different points of view are in the same writing style.  However, I don't know if the author of that review really realizes how difficult writing in different styles is (ever try Faulkner?  That is fun reading isn't it?) I feel that the author did this deliberately in order to depict his message in unconfusing ways.  Yes, the characters do not talk as people do in real life.  (That is why I read books, personally; I don't like the way people talk in real life). It is gothic in style and magnificent in its scope.  I think it is one of the best books I have ever read.	2005-05-04

He does not seem like a monster ( as he should be seen).  I guess this is the writer's way of telling us that he was not, and that due to circumstances that he could not handle in an appropriate way (leaving his wife) he killed his wife.   <br />A profile of this case is on the Doe network.

I found it to be about two very self-centered people, one who didn't even want children, about the trials and tribulations of trying to get pregnant at a later age.  The woman then seems to regret her choice for eventually having the children.  She also mentions that she was not someone who was even particularly interested in children....so why did she decide to have them?  I also found the section on why she chose not to adopt children, as well as the diary entry in which she discusses hating her children, particularly offensive.  The husband seems to be a jerk, and this couple does not even chose to live together when they are married...does this make any sense to you?  It did not to me.  I felt that Judith has a lot of unresolved mental health issues.  She also questions why she chose to do this at such a late age, that is my question too, as she does not seem to be loving or understanding of her own children in any way.<br />I was expecting to love this book, as I am an older new Mother.  Instead, I found it to be horrendous.  Perhaps I am putting my own personal issues with fertility treatments and advanced maternal age out here as well, perhaps there was too much transferance when reading the book.  All I can say is &quot;Yuck.&quot;	2004-06-11

I have two sons, and I pray that they don't become schizophrenic or bi-polar every day.  This book was scary. It is about what can happen when parents don't beleive in conventional medicine to help mental illness.  Schizophrenia cannot be curied through homeopathic remedies, aromatherapy, macrobiotics, or quack treatments.  It can only be monitored through medication and a good psychiatrist.  Even then it can still be dangerous, as many schizophrenics don't like to take their meds.  The Mom dominated the sons and the Dad seemed like he wasn't there.  What a tragedy.	2004-02-12

This was the book that suposily started the genre. It is very well written although I think Capote fictionalizes some aspects of the criminal characters to flesh them out more in the book.  Some of the language used is old fashioned, but this was written in the 1950s so what can you expect.	2004-02-12

Sometime it is a bit hard to follow, due to all of the different narration. However, it is on my top 10 best true crime books due to the detail that the author puts into the book.

I like their no nosense approach to products in that they advocate fully to spend a little more money sometimes to get better quality and better lasting products in things like car seats, booster seats, and strollers.
