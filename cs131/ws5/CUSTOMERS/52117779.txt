The main protagonist, Francis,  is mad; this means he spent a lot of time in an institution and has only slowly found his way back to a halfway normal life. Though normal is relative as he needs to take a whole dose of pills every day to fight back his voices and he has achieved nothing more but  the status of 'innocent idiot' in his home town.<br />He reflects on his time, now twenty years ago, in a mental institution. Katzenback is absolutely flawless in capturing the dark and grim mood of the mental health institition where inmates and caretakers alike are only there trying to pass the day without crating problems and with a total absence of a long term perspective.<br />This is the background for a gruesome murder to be investigated by a young women with the help of two inmates, amongst them Francis. The result is a rollercoaster of emotions and moral choices, in particular when the writing of the story pushes Francis back into his delusions. It is a fight against evil, the direct evil of the murder and the more allegorical evil of the institution, and a very heroic one indeed.<br />It is hugely rewarding as a reader to identify with Frances, a very,  very flawed individual, but with a keen sense of observation, and one ends the book not only having read a darned good mystery novel, but also with a lot of compassion for the inmates and other people in the asylum, not dissimalr to kesey's One flew over the Cuckoo's nest	2004-06-16

I have enjoyed quite a few of the Irene Kelly novels and this one was no exception...although it is not really Irene but her husband Frank Harriman that takes the spotlight. <br />Most writers have difficulty chnaging the main characters and have the previous ones only in cameo appearances. Not so Mrs Burke. <br />From the first page the novel takes off in a long prologue which could have been a story in itself. Ten years later, Harriman is picking up the pieces of a trail which is still as hot and contentious as it was 10 years ago.<br />Deft writing and excellent plotting keep us glued to the pages of the story.<br />I am looking forward to read more of Mr ( and I guess Mrs) Harrimans adventures.<BR> Harriman	2003-01-10

It is by far not as dry as most books on this subject and actually it is quite light reading.<br />It starts of well by demonstrating the rise and decline of Government dominated economies in the West as well as in other parts of the world. They describe the initial successes and later failures. The transition to the free market economies we have seen in the past two decades is described well. Unfortunately the book does little more than that...description.<br />In particular the idea that we have fixed everything now with the global free markets radiates from some of the pages on the Chicago/Harvard experts. The questions posed in the introduction on e.g. how to deal in terms of social and moral systems with the new economic order do not get attention. Instead we gate the same feeling as with reading Fukuyama's End of the World History which at that time was pretentious and looks utterly ridiculous today.<br />It is not only the current economic crisis but also the imbalances the new system has brought ( eg overproduction of commodities, loss of control over currencies, destabilized capital flows) that has not been identified as possible outcomes of the free market policy. This leaves  alone the many disasters the world has seen with privatization.<br />Therefore, a very good and entertaing read but a bit short on the thought provoking side.	2002-10-11

At the start of the Israeli conflict there were about 800.000 Palestinians and 200.000 Jews in the Paletine Mandate. This number of people, the size of a medium town have kept the headlines for the last 60 years and has had a tremendous impact on world politics, most of the time through problems of terror to each other and innocent bystanders. The events of the 11th of September are only the last installment in this tragedy.<br />In order to understand just a little bit of this conflict it is absolutely necessary to have some background on the political history of the region.<br />Prof. Cunningham does the job more than 100%. In a dispassionate, objective and always well-researched and very clear prose het takes us from the start of Islam through the Ottoman empire to today.<br />By showing the roots from Islam he describes a territory which for very long was not defined by our concept of Nation-State, but much more a loose federation based on a common belief. In particular during the Ottoman empire it appeared in it's true form; a tolerant society respecting the various forms of Islam and, indeed, taking Islam as the main religion but tolerant of other religions as well.<br />He also demonstrates quite clearly the devastating effects colonization has had in this region. By introducing the Realpolitik of that time where countries like Egypt and Syria only were regarded as supply centers for commodities or easy transport ( Suez Channel),the social fabric was destroyed and, more important, the right of self-determination was denied.<br />Whilst in other parts of the world this may have helped to develop the countries, like e.g.India, in the Middle East it has led only to disaster. In particular the way Syria, Lebanon and Palestina were dealt with in the Sykes-Picot Agreement is beyond belief. The only two interests that were served were the French and the English. A similar pattern is seen in regions like Iraq and Iran.<br />The resentment against the West is deep andgoes a long way back. And, to be sure, at leats for me I have compassion for this resentment. The people of the Middle East have served for a long time only as pawns on the international chessboard.<br />This in my view is the greatest value of Prof. Cunninghams book. He really takes us back to the many crossroads situation in the history of all these countries in the Middle East, demonstrates what choices there were and which have been chosen. Seldom this choice was the choice of the underdog in the game, the people themselves.<br />We therefore understand after reading the book that the people in the region believe that there are many flaws in our Western system and that they want to guard themselves against these by emphasizing their own, Islamic, values. Inevitably this leads to fundamentalism and extremism.<br />In particular, prof Cunningham shows the great despair of the Palestinian people. Driven from their home territory they have not a lot left to do. As a Westerner I had always feelings of sympathy for Israel and that remains. However, reading this book has made me see the Palestinian Plight in a much more reflective way and gave me understanding and sympathy for their situation as well.<br />Finally, a compliment for the writing; cristal clear and never boring.	2002-02-03

Many books have been written about this great President, not a few wondering what he was as a man and what his unique strenghts were that made him what he was. Most of these attempts failed at least partly ( see e.g. Ed Morris official biography).<br />His close friendship and his proximity for more than thirty years allowed Deaver to paint a more comprehensive portrait than anyone else. <br />It is not a long book because according to Deaver ( and Mrs. Reagan in her foreword)President Reagan was not a complicated man. The Reagan appearing from these pages is a man full in alignment with himself, confident in what he is doing, with full trust in his fellowman and with an iron self discipline. Add to that a good dose of humor, a sense for self depreciation and indeed you have the making of a great leader.<br />Deaver portrays this in a tender and loving style, leaving out all academic &quot;critical reasoning&quot; like a good friend and admirer is supposed to do. <br />His many anecdotes gives us insight in what Reagan was about; a private and shy man but with a wonderful feeling of what was going on in the USA in general and with individual people in particular. <br />I like one in particular, where the President had to pitch the first ball somewhere in a pro baseball game and did very well. Only through Deaver we learned he had been practising for seven weeks ( so much for being lazy).<br />Deavers prose is very succinct and unlike many other witness writers,  he manages to underscore his own role very much in order not to draw attention away from his subject. In that sense he does himself unjustice when he states that he cannot write as eloquent as Morris; this small volume is much more telling than the 800+ pages of Dutch.<br />In the end we cannot but share Deaver's sadness that in the twilight of his life Reagan cannot enjoy the rewards of &quot;the warmth and love of a thankful nation&quot; and indeed a thankful world. A sad, cruel and undeserved ending.	2001-07-22

In the past four years I have made four trips to Australia, each time to different parts of the country. There are many ways to travel to this huge country, but I guess most people, like me, take individual trips and simply rent a car and go. To do that the LP guide is indispensible. It comprehensively gives you all the basic information you need about places to stay and to visit as well as very helpful tips on road quality etc. Also it offers a fair amount of general information on the history, fauna and flora and on e.g. health considerations. As usual in the LP guides the little &quot;grey boxes&quot; with special info are interesting and sometimes quite funny.<br />When spending so much money on a trip in my experience it is always wise to take several guides. Others like the &quot;Insight Guide&quot; are excellent for wetting the appetite with all it's glossary pictures and is a good help to decide where to go. Once you are there, however, these guide offer much less information and you have to rely on the LP guide. No other guide simply offers you the opportunity once you have arrived simply to take a telephone and book the accomodation for the next day or to arrange special tours only a couple of days beforehand.<br />Given the size of the country it is a big book, well over 1000 pages, and it still covers only a part of what there is to see and to do. For the really dedicated I would recommend the territory LP guides, like e.g. the one on the Northern territories.<br />I disagree with other reviewers that it is only for backpackers; I have felt it quite useful driving from motel to motel. In particular, e.g. the info on Kakadu helped a lot planning our trip in this huge National Park and also the info on the Sydney part was very helpful to make our stay enjoyable and to steer us e.g. into the beautiful Blue Mountains.<br />Like any guide you have individual things like hotel prices which may have changed. Even then, it still permits you to select accomodation in your budget range, because if one has changed in a particular town, be assured the rest has as well!<br />Again, when spending so much on a trip, it would be very unwise not to spend the $ 25 on this guide.	2001-07-07

There are many beautiful coffee-table books about the country that wet the appetite for a trip. For the actual planning and for going around in the country, particular when you travel on your own, there is only one alternative and that is the LP guide.<br />It gives you very comprehensive information on what to expect, how to behave, what health precautions to take ( it is a western country in culture but not in nature!), how to get around( e.g. the passport shuffle to avoid stamps. A stamp in your passport prohibits you from visiting other Middle Eastern countries) etc.<br />The information on all the places to visit is very elaborate with good attention not only to the practical details but also to the historical and cultural value of the sites, like e.g. the info on the Via Dolorosa and the 14 stations Jesus stopped on his way to the Crucifiction. You are much better off walking yourself with the LP guide in hand, able to contemplate this deeply moving place than in the hands of one of the local guides/peddlers who do everything to distract you from your own thoughts to get you into one of the souvenir shops ( Mind you, it is in the Arab Quarter, so do not expect too much understanding for what you might feel). <br />The guide prepares you for trips into the Palestinian Territories. It does makes sense to read the newspapers to see whether there are any major problems, but generally the Guide is right in saying that there is little danger involved and that the Palestinians are more than friendly towards visitors.<br />The information on hotels is adequate; I did not involve a travel agency in planning my trip but used the telephone/fax adresses from the guide and have not been dissapointed.<br />Particularly helpful to me was the inclusion of a little section on the Egyptian side of the Sinai.I wanted to do some diving in Eilat, but decided after reading the guide and it's instructions to go to Sharm El Sheikh at the southern part of the Sinai which is with its Ras Mohammed National Marine Park probably one of the best dive spots in the world. Thanks to the guide, the organisation was a simple website visit in a Jerusalem hotel and accomodation was arranged.<br />Finally, I recommend the guide for the very sensitive way it handles the many religious issues in Israel. It certainly helps to makes you understand and contemplate the whole situation a little more.	2001-07-07

Delhi is one of the most fascinating cities in the world and a vast culture shock for everyone that visits India for the first time. This little guide offers some excellent ways to prepare yourself for Delhi and to soften it's blow a little. The great advantage over the India LP guide is that it's size is more limited ( of course) so that you can easily put it in your pocket whilst wandering around AND that the information is much more comprehensive than the big guide. <br />Be sure, India is not an easy place to travel and Delhi not an easy place to stay. The section of health is mandatory reading; you do not want to have any health problems in this place. <br />Having said that, there is so much to see and to do that you need this guide to do a bit of proper planning ( your Indian guide will not do that for you since they always seem to have a second agenda like bringing you to stores where they get a commission). The best way to see Delhi is simply to rent a car and a driver for a day and tell him where you want to go.<br />I have tried some of the walking tours and they are excellent. Even if it is too hot to walk, you can do them ( like I did) sitting in the back of a riksha and simply enjoy the variety of life in e.g. the Chandni Chowk area.<br />As usual in the guide the prices for the hotels are the official ones and with a couple of inquiries through the many websites you can get formidable discounts. If you can afford it take a good hotel; it is money wisely spent if you want to withdraw a little form the overwhelming impressions of a day on the streets of Delhi. Also hygienic standards are considerably higher.<br />There are two sections on Jaipur and Agra as well. In particular the latter warrants a visit when possible; the Taj Mahal is one of the great wonders of the world not to be missed. The guide gives you all the useful info on getting trains etc.<br />Enjoy if you are going to this wonderful place and make sure you have this little LP guide with you all the time.	2001-07-07

Deceit, her fourth, is probably the best.<br />Set in rural England it describes how Ellen comes to grip with the death of her husband, an MP. There seems to be more to it than thought at first sight and we follow Ellen, and her two children as the story slowly unfolds. Francis' strenght is the development of her characters. We really get to know Ellen to an extent that is sometimes embarrassing, in particular when you start to question the role she played herself.<br />The setting is a dark English countryside and that adds a moody element to the story. Francis excels in using outside elements to create a dark environment in which the story unfolds. She is very strong in the use of understatement ( a trait shared with other British female authors like P.D.James and Val McDermid)which underscores the sometimes frightening developments of events. In particular the dialogues are gems full of hidden meaning.<br />The plot is quite realistic; you really can imagine something like these events to happen.<br />Add to this enough subtle twist to put you on the wrong footing time and again and you have an excellent thriller.	2001-06-24

It is certainly not an overview of Oriental furniture since the emphasis is on display and design. It is, however, a great book for those who wish to blend in some Oriental furniture in their Western homes.<br />The title may be a bit misleading; the main part of the book concentrates on South-East Asian furniture and not so much on Japanese/Korean styles. Most of the furniture comes from Thailand, Burma and China.<br />For those, like me, who live in that part of the world that is OK. The antiques available in Bangkok, Singapore and Hong Kong are mostly, in the affordable categories,  from these countries. <br />In particular, there is a wealth of Chinese old furniture on the market. And for those who think prices are a problem, forget it.  We have picked up many cabinets from Chian around $ 750 and for similar amounts you go to a good furniture shop in BKK and have lovely pieces handmade for you from your own design ideas.<br />Even if you don't live here, but are here on a visit you can easily buy and have it shipped ( we have done it for friends on quite a few occassions). The shipping rates are quite OK and allow you still to pick up some pieces at good prices.<br />For amateurs like me, who simply wish to introduce some Asian elements in their homes this book is very valuable and gives many ideas, not in the least through the many photographs.	2001-06-23

Mahfouz opened Egypt and, through her short-listing for the Booker Prize, Mrs.Soueif got world wide recognition as a secon writer from that wonderful country..<br />The Map of Love shows why. It is a wonderful novel combining two love stories, one contemporary and one in the past, with the struggle of Egypt for independence. The writing is so good and insightful that you can start to have a very vivid imagination of Anna, the main protagonist. Her gradual distancing from England and her increasing love for her new country is superbly drawn.<br />The style of the novel, mixing a current generation and her forebears allows a deep reflection on times gone by. It is in a way very sad to see that ninety years of struggle for independence, progress and development have basically come to naught as the same problems seem to appear over and over again.<br />Like Mahfouz, Mrs Soueif is always gentle, never judging fortright but in the end no less clear about her view on current Egypt.<br />A book to be read and to be remembered for a long time.	2001-06-23

A man is murdered whilst the niece of his wife is looking on. His niece should not have been there and is accused of the murder. Enough for Nina to start defending her.<br />At the same time she picks up her relationship with Paul again and the development of this relationship is as interesting as the other plot, and well intertwined as well.<br />At this high quality I hope to see many more entries in this series.	2001-06-17

I was standing just prior to the tearing down of the wall on the East side of it, together with 100.000+ East Germans when President Reagan deliverd his speech on the West side close to the Brandenburger Tor. We could not see him, could not cross the 800 yards which separated us, but we could hear him. The athmosphere of hope and joy is something I will never forget.<br />After the initial joy of the unification it turned out, of course, that &quot;Ossies&quot; and &quot;Wessies&quot; were quite different in many respects; values, education, and not the least material wealth. It became obvious that it would take a long time to reconcile the two people.<br />For me personnally, the many tours I took through the united Berlin in the early nineties are unforgettable and I have a deja vu feeling for many of the scenes of Peter Schneider's book. <br />He has set this book at one of the most interesting cultural and sociological environments in modern history and he does well in capturing the many small moments which make up the big picture. His description in the start of the book of the squatters in his new appartment block are splendid as well as the enfoldment of the exasperating red tape involved in repossessing the property.   He even gets a good try at explaining the moral dilemma involved in the acquirement of the building. Why would anybody, who has not the faintest idea that he is, be able to claim ownership after fifty years ( only think of what Marx had to say about ownership and how this would still be engrained in the Eastern mind...), in particular when it possibly was acquired under doubtful circumstances by a Nazi from the Jews in the early thirties.<br />All ingredients for a great novel by a good writer ( and Mr. Schneider is a perceptive one indeed).<br />Why then spoil it with this utterly useless sideplot of Edward's marriage to, as other commentators say, the jerk Jenny? It distracts and annoys. In particular his obsession with the erotic parts of the marriage are totally uninteresting and deviates the attention to what really should have been the center of the novel; life in the recently united Berlin.<br />Given the extreme sensitivity of the issue in Germany this was a good try, but it could have been so much better.	2001-06-10

Many people and organizations believed that the &quot;World&quot; should follow Aung San Suu Kyi's recomendation to keep the country totally isolated in order to maximize the pressure on the Junta.<br />The LP editors differ with her in opinion and explain why. This section should be read thoroughly as a visit to Burma does in my view indeed merit some careful consideration of the morals involved ( there is no wrong and right here). I do agree, however, with the authors and indeed with quite a few Burmese people I spoke to on my recent travels, that the isolationism is not helping the NLD very much and, on the contrary, provides a good platform for the Junta to keep all Western influence out. In particular the withdrawal of all Western companies has provided the Junta with a goldmine of concessions for simple things like cigarettes and soft drinks.<br />Having said all this, Myanmar is one of the most fascinating countries ( if not THE most fascinating) in South East Asia.<br />Whether you visit Yangoon with it's old English influence and it's melting pot of Burmese and Indian People or the country side, it does not cease to amaze in it's difference from what we are used to. Without wanting to downplay the poverty, the simplicity and deep religion of daily life makes one reflect on his own ambitions.<br />A visit to Mandelay is like going back a century. You will find yourself on a horse-cart on sandy roads, with old pagoda's everywhere and groups of monks and nuns ( from the age of four and onewards) flocking the roads.<br />The beauty of the sites is prolifiral, reflecting the deep rooted tradition of the Burmese to worship their gods and there forebears. They are too many to mention all, but one stands out; the Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangoon. With it's 98 meter high golden dome this 2500 years old stupa is a world treasure in line with the Taj Mahal and Angkor Wat.<br />The LP book isa necessity to have with you. It gives you compact information on this variety of beauties and, as stipulated before, it does not stun to take a view on the less esoteric political situation.<br />The information provided is generally correct, with the exception of course of the prices. Lodging is in reality much cheaper than the official rack rates which the LP guide has and a little negotiation will help you a long way. The LP guide does, however, point you to the right places to stay. By the way, consider, if you can afford, to stay at the top end for service and safety reasons. In Yangoon you get an excellent hotel for $ 60 per room.<br />The debate whether to go or not will continue until the Junta is replaced by a mure human regime. If you decide to go, however, make sure you have this guide with you.	2001-06-10

Australian author Maitland surprised the world five years ago with the Marx sisters, a wonderful little book about a neighbourhood in London and the human relationships between a number of immigrants against the  historical background of the last house of Karl Marx. This book introduced us to DCI Brock and DS Kolla.<br />In the Malcontenta we see them back in a more sophisticated novel with a lot of room for development of other charachters.<br />The plot is very good and well paced. A murder in a high profile clinic is given to DS Kolla to investigate but in a later stage she is pulled from the investigation and the investigation is closed. Not satsified with that Kathy involves Brock and this leads to a whole new set of events in and around the clinic.<br />Maitland has this wonderful talent of taking you ( luring you even..) into a situation where nothing much seems to happen, where you start to feel as if you were  listening to one of Poirots explanations and than...Boom it happens. This makes splendid reading.<br />This novel, more than the first, is also excellent in describing the backgrounds, the theathre, of where it all happens. In the description of the clinic you have the feeling of reading The Magic Mountain with different characters and in his description of the gay scene heis poignant and fair.<br />It is a pity that it takes such a long time to bring these books to the market. I bought the book four years ago in Australia and have re-read it again after all the publiciy on these pages.<br />It is well worth reading, however and I will certainly pick up the number three in this series as well.	2001-06-01

Particularly the Dissappearance, introducing us to Luke Garrisson, was an &quot;edge of the seat&quot; one.<br />The great writing continues in this book. The first thirty odd pages about the hostage situation are captivating and seem to lead into a very good novel again...only it isn't. These pages bear no relation to the further plot other  than to establish that Luke is a hero. That could have been done a whole lot quicker and without wetting the appetite with some very interesting characters. <br />Unfortunately, this weakness continues in the rest of the book. A &quot;situation&quot; with a FBI action against drug smugglers ends totally wrong. DA Nora Ray and her sheriff friend invite Luke to come help prosecute the FBI agents involved. This leads to a very different situation for Luke, professionally as well as privately, but he solves it neat ly in the end.<br />The telling of this story is excellent with very good development of the characters and interesting dialogue.

Although the story is nicely written ( hence the two stars) the plot is non-sensical. It is a sequence of violence and utterly unbelievable actions by characters both on the &quot;wrong&quot; and on the &quot;right&quot; side. What do you do when you discover a body? Yes, like every normal person, you go in, trash it and than burn the building...<br />I have no sympathy at all for the main character. After the way he behaved in his quest for the murderer of his brother, there is only one place for him and that is in a cell next to his enemies. <br />I enjoy reading hard boiled thrillers as much as the next guy, but you have to find something sympathetic in the protagonist otherwise it bores quickly.<br />Finally some writers think that you have to maximize the number of twists in a novel and Mr. Stewart is certainly of that school. In doing it, however, he becomes utterly predictable in the development of the story.<br />It is only a first novel, and he can write, witnessing his description of the environment in Alabama, so I hope the next one will be given a bit more thought and editorial care.	2001-05-05

He provides us with a highly original setting for a legal thriller and he certainly delivers on the courtroom drama.<br /> This alone should be enough for a good and enjoyable read. The book is, however, much more. It is exciting in creating the atmosphere of a camp of officers in the war with all its desparation, petty fights and daily boredom amidst a very explosive and for the inmates generally dangerous environment.<br />Than God, Katzenbach does not go for a black and white description of the Allies and the Germans; there are very bad characters among the inmates and there is some good old European ethics left in some of the Germans . It is quite clear that some of those (Fritz e.g.) faced a &quot;prisonors dilemma&quot; as often as the real inmates.<br />In this Katzenbach provides us not only with an exciting thriller but also makes us pause and reflect on human behavior in this most adverse of circumstances; a POW camp.<br />I can't wait to see the movie.	2001-05-05

Mr Lannguths book is highly readable and an interesting observation of a very interesting period in history. Langguth is clearly a very good writer and the use of narrative and replayed conversation makes the book read like a novel. And that is exactly the deception...it is not a novel and it pretends to be an adequate reflection on the Viet Nam war. I am surprised that Mr Langguth is also described on the flap as a historian. The utter lack of analysis in the book is stunning; it is al description!<br />Thirthy years after the war I think a couple of things are clear;<br />1. The US should never have entered the conflict on this scale.<br />2. The North Vietnamese regime which took over after 1975 was, and is, one of the most oppressive in recent history.<br />So why doesn't the author spend a single page of analysis on why the Government brushed aside all doubt on the validity of the domino theory? Why doesn't he go into the reasons recommendations from people like Ball and Bundy were never properly discussed? After reading 300 pages this total lack of reflection started to be very disturbing.<br />Furthermore, what on earth does move the author to write in such sympathetic way about the North Vietnamese. I would certainly grant that the &quot;ordinary soldier&quot;in the NVA and VC believed in what they were doing. The Politburo however was nothing more than your ordinary run of the mill bunch of communist power players, ruthless and on a totally different level of ethics. Ho Chi Minh was not a Ghandi and Giap certainly not a Bolivar!<br />The replay of conversations becomes downright laughable when e.g. a discussion between Mao and some Vietnames leaders is described where Mao says that the leaders should live a sober life and be an example for their people. I can't imagine any trustworthy source for such quotes and to take interviews with senior Vietnames officials as a source is nothing more than naive.<br />I am not an American and therefore do not suffer thesame trauma from this  terrible conflict as many US citizens, but I am certain that thirty years after the war the American people deserves a lot more than this utterly unbalanced view.	2001-05-05
US	52117779	R54V34GEOBBJJ	0066210828	429116202	Soul Mountain	Books	5	28	31	N	N	Difficult to read...but a unique experience	I must admit that, when the Nobel prize was anounced last year , that I had never heard of the author Gao Xingjian, a feeling I shared most probably with 95% of the rest of the world. My first reaction was: how nice that the price has gone to China, but couldn't they have chosen one of the more well known writers?<br />I think it was the Washington Post Review which defended the choice by saying, amongst other things, that the Nobel committe has chosen unknown writers before and they quoted Mahfouz, my absolute favorite writer and Saramango as examples. Therefore I decide to read Snow Mountain.<br />Not to my regret! Soul Mountain is an epic voyage through China, through the inner self of the writer through philosophy, through I don't know what. <br />You can read the book on several levels. His observations on China are wonderful and anybody who has traveled in that great country will recognize something about the strangeness and mystique that lure around every corner whilst at the same time also recognizing many of the very down to earth tableaus of the daily struggle for life.<br />Quite often I had the feeling of being taken back into Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motor Cycle Maintenance or Thomas Mann's the Magic Mountain; here you are reading about a very ordinary situation and all of a sudden you are taken into a major philosophical treatise.<br />The struggle of the writer with his inner self are dripping from every page. This perhaps, more than anything else, defines the strength of this book. It is a soul-searching effort which fortunately most people are not capable of. It would certainly not benefit my mental health to do the same. It felt gratified when it appeared at the end that the writer seemed to have found a workable peace in himself.<br />Gao writes sometimes tenderly, sometimes coolly analyzing, sometimes rebuffing and that all magnifies the power of this book; it seems that in all instances, without having control over them, he is capable of describing his feelings.<br />It is not an easy book to read. It does not have a plot and writing about feelings ensures a lack of coherence. However, he seems at all stages very much in command of what he is doing.<br />I am sure I have to read it a second, and even a third time to be able to grasp everything Gao wants to communicate and I will.<br />I will not comment on whether this book is worth a Nobel Prize but I know that, once again, the Nobel Committee has given us a writer of utmost quality which otherwise I would not have found.	2001-03-04

On top of that he has been part of four administrations and is therefore in an excellent position to write about what makes a political leader succesful.<br />The difference between a Presidency and a CEO position in a large company are quite substantial. A CEO, when he takes over, normally finds a structure, manned with people with experience, in place. On top of that, he answers to a Board which shares, in general, the goals and objectives the CEO has.<br />Not so much for a President; when a new man comes in he has to change the whole team and find himself, more often than not, with a constituancy in the Senate and Congress where his own party only holds a minority. A daunting task!<br />Gergen's observations how four Presidents handled this task are very keen and his analysis is profound. He shows clearly that a high intellect and a drive to achieve may be helpful but in no way guarantees succes. Think about Clinton and his ( or her) handling of the health care issue.<br />Gergen establishes clearly that a good organization and command structure is key. In particular in the transition period where the Presidency takes shape. This takes him to an admiring view on President Reagan and, whatever you think about his politics, I think that is deserved. In contrast, the preparation of Clinton was so poor, with many key appointments left open for months, that it has haunted him throughout his first term<br />Secondly, Gergen demonstrates the need for a good balance in the team. They do not all have to agree all the time, a certain amount of tension helps to improve the decision, but clear procedures to resolve conflict and organization in decision taking is key. Again he quotes President Reagan with Baker, Meese and Deaver as achieving this optimally and others like Nixon through Haldeman and Ehrlichman, and Clinton in a quite chaotic three people leadershp structure ( Mr and Mrs and the VP asthe top box) failling. <br />Thirdly, he sees the key in Presidential success in the relationship between the White House on the one hand and Congress/Senate on the other. This means that every team needs to have a number of players that are well experienced in dealing with the House. He made it with quite a few examples clear where Presidents Clinton and Nixon where falling short in this respect.<br />Finally, he dwells, quite justified, on the character of the President as a key element for success. Those at ease with themselves and a clear vision on what they want to achieve ( like Reagan) have a much better chance on success than those with flaws like Nixon and Clinton. It is not a guarantee, as he describes in the case of Gerald Ford, but it certainly helps.<br />All these analyses makes the book a very good read. Gergen's sober and reflective observations of the process and the people involved, without being tempted to throw in &quot;juicy details&quot;, makes this an excellent work.	2001-03-04

No doubt it is not a gentle world Lehane describes. Bullits are flying, people are dying and characters like Bubba hopefully in the real world are picked up and spend the rest of their life behind bars.<br />Lehane, however, trnascends the normal level of such thrillers through his exceptional talent for dialogue and character development. We learn to know Patrick and Angie with all their strengths and flows. We live with them trough the trauma of the developments and their misjudgements but we like them the more for it.<br />Mr.Lehane never ever leaves his eye off the ball as far as dialogue is concerned; it is magnificent.<br />After this first novel, I would have thought that the following ones ( like it happens so often) would be weaker. This is certainly not the case and therefore I cannot wait to read his latest one!	2001-03-04
US	52117779	RKGVVW6BFG550	0864426763	613589758	Lonely Planet East Africa, Fifth Edition	Books	5	63	64	N	N	An absolute necessity for travellers to east Africa	There are many places in the world you can travel to without a Lonly Planet. East Africa is not part of that. East Africa is no doubt one of the most beautiful parts of the world but travelling and getting around here is not easy at all and has many &quot;dangers&quot; one should be aware of.<br />There are many ways to do it. You can go on an all organised expensive safari in Kenya or Tanzania. Even then I would think you would like to see some of the places outside the parks like Nairobi or Arusha.<br />The best way to do it is to travel by yourself. I have done it a couple of times now and find that all the organization by travel agents does not make up for the flexibility you have when you do it yourself. I have been in bad weather conditions necessitating an immediate change of plans. I have been so overwhelmed by the beauty of the Serengeti that I decided on the spot to stay longer. I have been so disgusted by some hotels I prebooked that I decided instantly to look for another one.<br />This book gives excellent and absolutely necessary guidance to do so. The getting around sections are good and up to date and, believe me, without it you will not find your way out of, e.g.Arusha on a bus to Nairobi. Local assistance is difficult to find.<br />Booking hotels in countries like Tanzania is not like we are used in the rest of the world. In most of the parks you have one or two lodges and if they are full you are outside; not a nice pprospect when you are right in the middle of the animals. The pricing information is fair and, again, you have to do some planning given the huge differences in prices between hotels.If you plan to stay in the Rhino lodge in the Ngorogoro Crater and the only open one is the Sopa, it will set you back at least an additional $100.<br />All the &quot;facts for visitors&quot; in particular the medical sections are good and should be read carefully. They can keep you from very annoying situations. <br />The safari sections are good and provide an abundance of companies you can organise your own tours with. They can be checked out in advance. The best way to do it however, if you have time, is to spend a few days in Nairobi or Arusha and compare the offers of the various companies and talk to the owners to see what they provide. You will be amazed how good and cheap these local operators are. A further advantage is that they go off the beaten track, so that you are not having a situation where eleven Volkswagen busses are in a circle around a sleeping lion.<br />For those reallly into it, try out camping in the Serengeti or Arusha. You will find yourself one with nature and, allthough there are no fences and you should keep a good fire going, relatively safe.<br />For those less adventurous and on a more tight schedule, the Guide still contains such a wealth of information and little sections on 'nice to knows' that it is well worth the investment.<br />If I would be allowed to advise I would prefer the Tanzanian side to the Kenyan side for going on safari. It is definitely more beautiful ond not half as busy.<br />Finally, I will never forget the images I took away from this part of the world. Cheeta's running through the grasslands in chase of prey. Lion mothers tending their cubs, the vast herds of wildebeest, the zebra's, giraffes peeping curiously through the leaves at your car and the wonderful sunsets sitting at a campfire and reflecting and the beauty of creation.<br />I hope you will enjoy your trip.	2001-03-04

Never before had the judicial system been used on such grand scale to pursue political goals.<br />2. No other major political controversy in American history produced as few heroes as this crisis.<br />Like a clinical pathologist Toobin disects all the legal cases and arguments and comes to the simple conclusion, which was shared by the American people and indeed by many others world wide, that there was not much to each of the three cases.<br />The Whitewater case died slowly; it was never proven that the Clintons had done anything wrong in losing their $ 40.000<br />The Paula Jones case was viewed at what it was; a lady with quite a sexual history who goes up to a hotel room to meet a man with quite a sexual history. Whatever happened in that room was probably sleazy but did not make up much of a case.<br />The Lewinsky matter was all about a consual sexual encounter between two adults. Again, from the President's side sleazy and from a moral point probably inpardonnable but a crime?<br />The real thing was that Clinton lied about that...but again what do you expect from a familyman to do. Isn't this what, unfortunately happens in many other marriages as well. <br />Did Clinton commit perjury? Legal experts have been fighting about this and it is not clear. Most probably they should not have asked him the question in the first place.<br />The use of the judicial system to pusue political goals is painfully described. Time and again cases that are nearly dead are refuelled. Not by a &quot;vast right wing conspiricy&quot; but by all sort of individuals and groups with a grudge against Clinton's politics. The five(!) investigations into the death of Vince Forster are a disgrace and makes one really worried ( what has this done to his widow and kids?).<br />All people, Clinton to start with, appear as being in the game not for the good of the country but for their own miserable selfish needs, be them financial, career or whatever. A notable exception is Justice Wright who deserves a statue for her behavior. <br />An important question, of course, is whether a man like Clinton as President can provide the country with the moral leadership which is expected of that high office. It is important to realize however that whilst the people knew most of the facts of the scandals they have given him a mandate with his re-election. That should have stopped all these cases and investigations.<br />Mind you, I think Clinton has not been a good President; the economy has bloomed, that is true but also not his doing and I will always remember him for his total absence of moral leadership. But... this alone is no basis whatsoever for impeachment.<br />Toobin proves his two theses meticulously and deserves therefore great credit; he brought the whole range of scandals back to what it was, a number of very questionnable characters out on personal gain.<br />Some reviewers say that the American People are the great winners with their steadfast viewing of all these allegations as  rather inconsequential and I wholeheartedly agree.<br />After reading this book we perhaps now should stop reading all the trash which is still published about this period as a silent protest against everyone that still tries to use the scandals to pursue their own goals.	2001-03-03

Everything is so well organised in this beautiful city that you can get around very easily yourself. Every hotel has a good travel desk and the rooms generally carry maps and brochures of everything that there is to do.<br />Nevertheless, like on most of my trips I found the investment of a couple of dollars (compared to the total invetsment of the trip absolutely nothing) well worth the money. The guide gives a very simple help in a couple of areas. The &quot;How to get there&quot;for all the sites makes life simpler; you know which bus to take and which Underground station to leave for all the major sites. The info on the parks is accurate and little tips like &quot;do not leave the Night Safari after 23.00 otherwise you will not catch the latest train at Ang Mo Kio really help to plan a trip; at least you know in advance that staying later means queing up for a taxi ( and paying a hefty fare).<br />It's a comfortably thin guide so you can take it with you whilst travelling around. As usual the info on restaurants is good and leads you to interesting places.<br />The only caveat, like with most travel guides for this part of the world, is the details on prices. In particular the price info on hotels hass little value since they give the rack rates and these days with a simple Internet search you are able to get big discounts as you can by booking through travel agents.<br />In a lot of Asian countries you need to have a Lonely Planet for travelling; in Singapore it is a (very) nice to have and a necessity for a lazy one like me.	2001-02-27

A book which entertains and will not dissapoint.<br />It is not a story of good guys versus bad guys ( although there are some genuinely despicable people) but more of a number of people in doubt of the right course to take leading to enormous consequences.<br />Highly recommendable indeed for a couple of hours next to a swimming pool!	2001-02-27

He is the man for all opportunities and is called the &quot;Friend of all Mankind&quot;. He is neither Hindu nor Muslim, he is neither Buddhist nor Christian. Given his background as the orphan son of a Irish military man and a local girl he is a little bit of everything. <br />In Kim Kipling personifies all the good of Inida while playing down the contrasts, in particular the religious one; he shows us what India would have been like in an ideal situation of mutual tolerance.<br />Apart from these philosophical considerations, Kim is simply a very well written book. Every passage betrays Kiplings background as a poet and sometimes passages really need to be reread for their beauty. His observations are striking and one realises from time to time that it is not the writers imagination about a period long gone; he was actually part of that period.<br />One thing Kim is not: a childrens book. Like Siddharta ,a child may be the main character, but the book is far to philosophical and aimed observing intricate human behaviour to be of much interest to children. I would even maintain that Kim should not be the first book to read about India.<br />However, one of the best reads I had in a long time.	2001-02-20

Unlike my normal travels this time I stayed in luxury hotels and had arranged transport. Therefore I did not depend on the guide to tell me which bus to take from which museum etc ( at any rate a painful thing to do with most guides and something to be explored much more easily locally).<br />The guide was superb in giving condensed information on the places we have visited ( Beijing, Xi'An and Shanghai) and enabled us to do all the planning of what we wanted to do and wanted to see whilst travelling. I found the information on markets and shopping to be very accurate and, most enjoyable, for all the markets, places of interest, restaurants, hotels etc. the guide had the names in Cihinese characters as well, so that we could tell our driver or the taxidriver where to go.<br />Also the general information on history and culture where quite interesting and gave another dimension to our short and unplanned trip. All in all well worth the value.<br />One tip; the guide has for all the hotels the listed prices. Through the Internet or with frequent flyer cards you can get up to 60% discounts even in the big hotels like Sheraton and Hilton.	2000-12-02

In my case reading Burmese Days from Orwell ( a gripping satire of the moral bancruptcy of colonial life) and the recently published A Glass Palace by A. Ghosh ( a historical novel on Birma wriiten by an Indian writer, highly recommended) made me pick up my old copy of Farrell's Siege again.<br />Much more benign than Orwell, but no less effective in his description of the decline of Colonial Rule, Farrell's book should be on the short list of readings for everybody interested in the history of Colonial Rule in general and India in particular.<br />The book describes, in a nutshell as one of the reviewers quite aptly remarked, the transformation of a group of self-confident and morally superior rulers to a group of helpless people in an alien environment. It shows in a beautifully described way the rapid decrease in moral cohesion which resulted of their change in circumstances.<br />In a way, the books mirrors the decline of Western Rule we have seen in the past 150 years and serves as a wonderful reflection of the behaviour of the West in the past.<br />In my view it ranks amongst the very few top novels ( like Passage to India and Jewel in the Crown and the earlier mentioned Birmese Days) of the colonial past.<br />It is a shame that this book is not among the standard range of books offered in the bookshops anymore because it is as much part of our literary history as it's more well known contemporaries.	2000-12-02

Parmet I have not found the answer.<br />Bush has been a succesful businessman after a distinguisged service in the Air Force during the war. He has served as a Senator, as head of the CIA, as the Ambassador to China in an extremely interesting period in Sino-American relations and, finally, as a Vice-President to a very succesful President. What more can you ask as preparation for the most powerful job on earth? It is true that he failed to get elected twice, but is it not a credit to any man when he overcomes defeat to embark on such an interesting career?<br />The view which I get from this biography is on a balanced man who understood politics very well and also had the gift of personal integrity unmatched by most of his predecessors and certainly not by his successor. <br />It is true that he was not the greatest of communicators and PR guys, but there one should not forget that he had a very difficult, if not impossible act to follow. It is to his credit that he did not even try to imitate Reagan, but that he led the country in his own personal style.<br />One should forgive for being biased, as a European, to his Foreign Policy, since my understanding for and interest in the domestic scene is limited. <br />Bush Presidency can be characterised by formidable leadership in two distinguished events. His conduct of the events of the Gulf War was exemplary. Powell get's a lot of the credit, but I feel that is, partly, undeserved. It was the President's deciding leadership which effectively stopped Saddam's adventure in Kuwait. Of all the wars in which the US got involved after 1945 the handling of the Gulf War was the most succesful. It has been an act of extraordinary diplomacy and brinkmanship to get e.g. Saudi Arabia and Israel on one line. Haven't we all been worried about the Tel Aviv reaction after the first scud missiles hit the country? Personnaly I will not forget the relief I felt when, in the middle of the night in Europe, I saw and listened to Bush anouncing the invasion. This was clearly a leader who believed in what he was doing and who felt to be in full control, aware of the risks of his venture.<br />A second event has been the unification of Germany. After all the rhetoric of the Reagan administration, it was under Bush that this extraordinary process was done swiftly and with great succes and, most astonishing, without bloodshed. I am aware that the prime players were Kohl and Gorbachov, but it could never have been done without the full support and the tacit agreement of the US. Indeed, by taking a silent and , overtly, modest role Bush did exactly the right thing. I don't think under Reagan, it would have been as smooth. <br />All this is reconted in this book in fine scholarly detail, which distinguishes this author from the many, more sensational, political writings one sees so often these days.<br />I think this is a fine book about a succesful Presidency and a man of integrity one could only wish would emerge more on the political scene.	2000-10-07

This time I visited Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi and did some excursions around both cities like Gu Chi tunnels and the Perfume Pagoda, close to Hanoi.<br />On the trip my companion and I used to LP guide mainly as a source of planning ( where to stay, how to get there, where to eat) etc. The value of the guide for doing this is excellent. People critisizing should not forget that generally they pay a fortune in flight cost and other things to come to the country and than expect a full comprehensive view of the $ 15 investment.<br />Vietnam, of course, is a country with a lot of history, not in the least of recent times and to really enjoy your trips you have to read one or two books on the subject. The LP guide is not meant for that.<br />For going around the guide is excellent. Information is accurate and pretty comprehensive ( of course, the country changes rapidly one should not forget. The getting around sections are good, although it should be emphasized that it is not as easy as it looks to travel by yourself. If I have one critizism it is that I feel that perhaps they should extend the food recommendations. There are many, many excellent restaurants and in those recommended you see, virtually literary, the crowd sitting reading their LP's.	2000-09-24

Kakadu and Litchfield are superb national parks with stunning landscapes and further south things like Devil's Marbles and Ayers Rock are breathtaking. Of course, the whole journey of about 2500 miles from Darwin to Alice Springs along the Stuart Highway is an adventure.<br />The LP guide gives a lot of good tips on where to stay and what to see. The information, as usual, is accurate and certainly helps to get around. It contains a lot of interesting &quot;extra&quot; information on things like Aboriginal Art etc.<br />However, the book misses out on quite a few things which you can see and do in the parks and villages you visit like e.g. the gold digger in Pine Creek who for the &quot;gold museum&quot; in Pine Creek where we could &quot;find&quot; our own gold.<br />The best thing is to take a couple of books. During the long ride there is plenty of time to read. The LP guide is not an appetite wetter, but it is a very good tool for planning your trip and should not be missed out.	2000-09-24

The country is still not very  accessible although much has been improved in the past years, in particular  available flights.<br />If you plan to go, read the guide very carefully. It  gives you enough background to do it on your own. However, I would still  recommend to go for local assistance ( with the exception of Siem Rap when  visiting Ankor Wat)<br />The country is beautiful and the people are very  nice. If you have time and sense of adventure it is definitely worth a  trip.<br />Pnom Penh should be the centre of the visit and the guide is at  it's most helpful here with good background on the Tol Sluen Prison or the  Killing Fields as well as on the nicer things like the Palace and the  Silver Pagoda. A tip: try to take a good hotel. PP can be a bit depressing,  particularly after a visit to the fields, and also is not a very safe place  to go out at night without guide or transport. If you have transport you  should eat of course in the Foreign Correspondent Club.<br />Angkor Wat is a  must, although the guide maybe overdoes it a little. I find that you must  be a real &quot;culture buff&quot; to use more than one day for a visit. In  Siem Rap there is nothing, so don't fall for the trap of a four day  visit.<br />In general, I find the guide giving good information and,as in all  the countries here in SE-Asia, if you want to travel alone, you HAVE to  take it with you.<br />I have been in Cambodia now a couple of times and each  time I find it a good adventure, not in the least because of the help of  this good guide.	2000-09-12
US	52117779	R1XFPZ5JJ86LIF	8175300310	197783362	Glass Palace	Books	5	51	60	N	N	A very enjoyable historical novel.	The Glass Palce is a, very well written, historical novel but at the same  time a very thoughtful reflection on humanity and many of it's  dilemma's.<br />On top of this I found it intriguing that the story  concentrated on a relatively unknown part of the British colonial past;  Myanmar/Birma and it's relationships with India and Malaya.<br />Fianlly,  unlike most historical novels, which originate from the former  colonialists, this is written from the local perspective by a local  writer.<br />The story itself is epical in proportion intertwining the stories  of the banned King of Birma and his servants as well as the prospering of a  young man in the timber trade. It spans various generations from the middle  of the nineteenth century to the last years of the last century.<br />I have  been fortunate enough to visit all three countries described in the recent  months and I was fascinated by the way Gosh describes them. He has a  wonderful feeling of observation and a poet's gift with words.<br />In  particular the early part, in which Mandelay is the centre stage is done  wonderfully.<br />The need Gosh feels to be exhaustive in all his historical  facts sometimes is a bit awkward and artificial. However, the storytelling  and the story line are good enough to keep the reader interested. I warmed  to most of the characters and felt really part of the story.<br />A very good  read for anybody who likes a good novel and in particular for those who are  interested in this part of the world.	2000-09-11
US	52117779	R13MVZ724H6HNY	0864426364	875576584	Lonely Planet Thailand (8th ed)	Books	5	20	20	N	N	Indispensible for any trip through Thailand	The Thailand LP guide was the first ever LP guide to appear and it is  clear that Cummings et.al. still take as much pride in the latest edition  as they did in the first.<br />The guide is indispensible for everybody who  wants to have a REAL good trip through Thailand, because the best way to do  it is by yourself and not on an organized trip. The country is very  accessible with a good road system and excellent public transport. There  are more than 25 domestic airports and most fares from Bangkok are around $  100 return. If you want to go even cheaper bus and train provide excellent  alternatives<br />Since four years I am living in Thailand and in that time I  have, mainly for my work, traveled through the country extensively. Still,  I never go out on a trip without taking this book with me and it helped me  enjoy very much the places I traveled to as well as given me many good  local itineraries. Let me give a few examples.<br />When I was the first time  in Pitsanoluk I was intrigued by the guide's description of the Wat Yai and  went for a visit. This temple is little known among tourists but it is one  of three most revered among the Thai people and if you really want to enjoy  Thai religious life there is no better place than this temple.<br />In Chiang  Rai I had a day top cover between business meetings and reading the guide  decided to travel along the border to the old Kuo Mintang settlements.  Apart from the amazing landscapes the villages themselves like Mae Salong  were absolutely intriguing.<br />On another trip I had half a day before  leaving Chiang Mai and decided, after reading the guide, to go to Doi  Inthanon, the National Park. The views at 6000ft were absolutely superb and  the whole trip was very enjoyable.<br />I could give many, many more examples  but that would surpass the purpose of this review.<br />There are in my view  three reasons why every aspirant traveler to the Kingdom should invest in  buying the guide.<br />First, it is awelth of information. Apart from the  normal stuff, the guide contains many &quot;gray sections&quot; with  wonderful information telling you e.g.why the Thais love their kings so  much, what the role is of the elephant in daily life, the background of the  Railway station in Hua Hin etc.etc. Above all, the info on the various  festivals is very good and if you have the chance make sure you participate  in one, in particular Loy Kratong.<br />Second, the guide is very practical  for planning your trip.The getting around sections are good.The information  it contains on hotels etc. is accurate and, because the Thai telephone  system has not changed in the past years, most of the telephone numbers of  hotels and guest houses are still usable. It is always advisable to  pre-arrange lodging. The restaurant information is OK as well. I have tried  a lot of the restaurants in Bangkok described in the guide and in most  cases the impressions are spot on.<br />Third, it gives good advise on how to  behave. Thailand is a very friendly country but not as regulated as some  Western countries. The sections on travelling and trekking ( go in groups  and not alone, especially if you are female)or which part of the border  with Cambodia or Myanmar need to be avoided because it is still controlled  by the druglords, must be read. Unfortunately, every couple of monthes in  the local papers we see the horror stories of those who did not follow this  advise. Also the sections on ilnesses, aids and prostitution may be  relevant. There are many lighter sections as well; on the Thai smile, the  wai etc., which must be read to understand what to do and to enjoy  it.<br />Finally a word on Pattaya. I think the guide gives it exactly the  attention it deserves. Pattaya is nice for a short beach break from Bangkok  but if you have more than a weekend or if you can afford to fly, the  beaches of Samui, Phuket and Krabi are much more exotic and beautiful (  white sand and palm beaches). If you go to Pattaya for the nightlife you do  not need a guide; the girls and the neon lights live absolutely nothing to  the imagination...<br />In sum, Thailand should be traveled on an individual  basis ( proably the easiest one to do that in SE Asia) and this book not  only helps doing that but it also makes the planning a lot of fun. Enjou  your trip.	2000-09-11

A lot of writers  have to use their intricate  knowledge of a certain environment to hide the weakness of plot and  character. Ridpath does not. The plot is tight, the characters are likeable  and the story is told very well.<br />Basically, it is a simple story. In the  venture capitol world there is always a lot of money at stake. Here it  concerns investments in Bio One which stands to make a lot of money for the  firm Simon works for.<br />Then, one of the senior partners is murdered and  Simon has been the last to see him. More and more, people start to suspect  Simon, including his wife.<br />So he is on his own to proof his innocence and  he knows the more he discovers the more the real culprit is on his  trail.<br />The classic ingredients for a good novel and that is all Ridpath  produces; no complex characters, no moral highgrounds, just simple  entertainment.	2000-08-27

What makes  it a good read is the nice &quot;behind the scene&quot; view of the glossy  magazine world.If we have to believe the writer ( and why not, he is a BIG  player in this world) it is a ruthless and dangerous environment,  interesting enough as background for a well developed thriller.

US	52117779	R3PBQAOLEY3N6H	0385333862	94741593	The Running Mate	Books	5	4	6	N	N	More than just a political thriller	Quite often a second novel has much less to offer than a first one, particularly when the first one was done with such a marketing hype as &quot;Primary Colors.<br />Therefore this book was such a pleasant surprise.  Klein, fortunately not 'Anonymous' anymore, has given an insight in the  political process only a real insider can and has written a well-plotted  and fast-paced novel on top of that.<br />The novel describes in perfect  detail the sometimes cynical approach to politics, but at the same time  avoids depicting all the politicians as immoral beings. At the end of the  novel I had a real liking for the Senator<br />Senator Martin has ended a  campaign for the Presidential Candidatship in disgrace by being accused of  sexual harrassment by one of his aides.<br />Dissappointed he goes to  South-East Asia and rehabilitates himself by getting an American out of  prison in Vietnam. The man is there because he had killed a child in the  war without any reason and returned to do penance. When the refuses to go  out the Senator quotes Ghandi who once said that for every child killed you  should save a child. You can feel the Senator thinking that this is a line  which always went down well with voters so why not try it here and it shows  the lack of conviction in what Martin is doing.<br />He then moves back to  Washington and becomes very much part of the circle of people trying to  position theirselves in the musical chair game for Cabinet positions.<br />He  rehabilitates himself morrally when he refuses to endorse his friend Sly in  his quest for the Secretary of Defense position because he is certain that  he takes much more Valium then is good for him. This move does not make him  many friends and the spin doctor process again is a demonstration for the  sometimes very cynical level politics is conducted at.<br />Time and again  this theme is recurring in the novel, in particular when he seeks his  re-election in his homestate in the Midwest.<br />Klein artfully portarys the  two ends of the moral spectre in the low character of the Senator's  adversary, Butler, a local businessman and the high moral grounds of the  Senator's fiancee, Nell.<br />Senator Martin's own position is in the middle,  not only driven by his own ambiguous thoughts ( the choice between values  and ambition) but also by the simple realities of political and public  life.<br />In the end one cannot help but feeling thoroughly sympathetic to  the Senator's actions and positions, much more than for the positions taken  by Butler and Nell. It is easy to condemn from an armchair but to me it is  clear that any country could do a whole lot worse without the likes of  Martin governing it.<br />The strenght of the book is that it does not matter  very much what political positions the various protagonists take. Left or  right, liberal or conservative, the main criterium for a good politician is  his decency, his moral strength and his capability to act, and indeed  sometimes to compromise, according to the situation at hand.<br />All in all,  a very good read and hopefully a start for many more good novels on the  politics of Washington.<br />One final note; Klein is not very friendly in  describing Bangkok, where the Senator stays for a couple of days, as a  place of cheap sex and drugs. I am a resident of Bangkok and can tell you  that it is a beautiful capital of a very gentle and friendly people, which  has much more to offer than what the Senator thinks.	2000-06-03

A Survival Guide to Customs & Etiquette)	Books	5	59	61	N	N	A must for people going to Thailand	This is one of the funniest and nicest books I read when I prepared myself four years ago to go to live in Thailand.<br />Thailand is a very special country. It has never been for a long time conquered by alien powers and  therefore has developed a unique, own culture. This book gives you a good  insight and, much more, it wets your appetite.   Going to live in Thailand,  with the family, is a big shock in many ways. This book guides you nice and  gently and with a lot of humor through your first embarrassing days. I have  re-read the book , after four years, whilst now feeling complete at ease in  this, indeed sometimes strange society. I still smiled a lot because I  recognised so many situations.<br />The information is certainly not out dated  as some reviews suggest. It should be more treated as reflection on the  culture as taken too literally. Indeed, if you drive your car into some one  else his Mercedes ( I've done it twice)the chances are that the gentleman  stepping out his car will be extremely cross with you and express himself  in that way instead of smiling at you and making the wai... However, in  general people are much, much less aggressive and I have learned to be more  relaxed even in situations like an accident as well.<br />Some things you will  never get used to. When you fall flat on your face ( as happende to me in  front of a lot of subordinates) everybody is roaring for laughter. And then  you thank your little &quot;Culture shock&quot; for explaining to you these  four years ago that they are not poking fun at you, but hiding their  extreme embarrassment.<br />Read it.. It will prevent you from doing very  stupid things and it will enrichen your stay in Thailand!	2000-05-26

I was very surprised indeed. It is a very strong,dark and gloomy thriller set  against the unusual background of Edinburgh. The DS is a drop out of the  army's elite unt, SAS and has become a veteran policeman.&quot;A good, but  not very good one&quot;according to his boss.<br />The city is haunted by a  serial killer who goes for little girls, without harming them  sexually.<br />John is receiving all kinds of notes which are written as  riddles. He neglects them for a while but with the help of his brother he  finds a connection in his past to the killer and goes on a haunt.<br />The  hunt is not heroical and leaves a lot of scars for the people involved. In  particular Rebus himself is on the receiving end.<br />The story is written so  tightly that you can't help wanting to finish it in one setting and leaves  a lot of looking forward to the next installments.<br />A good read.	2000-05-06

It is very enjoable to follow Dismas through life and this book adds, again, a very interesting chapter.<br />It is a very good thriller with many twists and bends which keep  the interest more than alive.<br />It is also a quite interesting reflection  on the American Justice system with a DA office more driven by personal  ambition than by the desire to serve the public.<br />Finally, it is a very  delicate reflection on the development of a marriage. Lescroart is at his  best describing the relationship between Franny and Dismas and the danger  of routine and digression of common interests. There is no doubt Dismas  loves his children. But why then does he so often feel they are hurting his  relationship and hindering his personal progress? The way Lescroart  describes this, with a lot of lovely ( and sometimes very &quot;politically  uncorrect&quot;) observations is extraordinary and something all readers  with children can recognize.<br />This is all done in a tight plot leaving  enough room also for the other characters, like Abe Glitsky, whom we have  started to know in his previous novel.<br />In summary, this book has it all  and is an absolute must for the Dismas fans.	2000-04-30

New Zealand is not one of these countries.The way to enjoy New Zealand is to travel from place to place and not to pre-book everything ( you are too  dependent on the weather to do that and also it takes away the feeling of  freedom this country has to offer). The more flexible you want to be on a  trip the more important it is to have a good guide. We arrived in Auckland  with only a general idea what we wanted to do in our three weeks and we  found that we left all other guidebooks in the suitcase and relied  exclusively on the Lonely Planet to plan our trip. The guide contains all  necessary information and is surprisingly up to date. The most important is  that it is not a commercial tourism promoter but that it gives you an  honest impression on what there is that you can do.<br />E.G. it was pretty  clear after reading the relevant chapters that for our family it was more  appropiate to go to Wanaka instead of Queenstown because the children were  not yet at an age that they could enjoy all the thrills of the latter and  that Wanaka, whilst offering jetboating and biking was more  appropiate.<br />We had the book continuously with us during the driving and  it made the journey so much more interesting through knowing always a  couple of KM ahead what the interesting sites and spots were.<br />The book  could have been priced at a much higher level; we still would have bought  it.<br />Highly recommended for every would be traveller to New Zealand	2000-04-30

The book is very well written with Alice, the girl that is completely obsessed with Adam Tallis, never losing much of my  sympathy, even though it is difficult to contemplate her actions in real  life.<br />As a thriller the book is less succesful and certainly not up to  the standard of the first two books of this writer.

Even though the plot is by far not as strong and tight as her first  novel, the writing is good enough to keep you on the edge of your seat; by  times witty, by times reflecting and a good solid portion of well written  thrilling scenes.<br />I am as a reader quite happy to share the feelings  Temperance has but I am also glad that we are not taken on the long soul  searching journeys that her literary rival, Kay Scarpetta, takes us all the  time.<br />I hope the third novel is just as good and highly recommend this  one for a quiet weekend.	2000-04-27

It is no wonder that four years after publication you still find a lot of references to this book and even see it quite often still on special display in the bookstore.<br />It is the combination of being a thriller ( with all the twists and surprises) and a real classical tragedy that makes  this book so appealing. <br />The love story of Miss Channing and Mr.Reed  unfolds and ends like probably a lot of them have ended in real life in the  periods just after the war and one sits back and wonders about the beliefs  and moral values in the community which helped the tragedy to take it's  pace.<br />It is exceptional when a writer, particularly one writing thrillers  which also have the objective to entertain, can make you question your own  beliefs about the right and wrong in human behaviour.	2000-04-27

It is the story of a very average family in Lubeck somewhere in the last century. The description of the members of this familiy with all their flaws, carefully depicted in all  detail like in the great realistic paintings, is wonderful and it is  difficult to believe that the writer was only 25.<br />In particular his  description of the &quot;kleinbuergerlichkeit&quot;( I have not seen this  German word translated correctly in any language, but it means something  like the small citizen in a small town)is phenomenal.<br />In the reviews I  see quite some comments on the translation. I am both fluent in German and  English and I have read this translation with the original on the side.  Indeed, the absolute purist may complain that some of the German nuances  and wordgames Mann likes to use get lost. However, you have to have such a  good understanding of the German, that you would not need a translation. In  my view the translator absolutely got the spirit of the novel right and was  able to re-create this typical small town atmosphere in Northern Germany  very, very well. And fact is, Mann in German is very difficult, even for  Germans. This translation has made the work of an unique author available  to a wider public	2000-02-09

When two years ago The Judgement was published I assumed it was done posthumously, but still  written by the author himself.<br />This is certaily not the case for The  Court. Yes, I know that it is based on one of his earlier novels, but the  many references to the Internet, the Reagan years, the Clinton  administration and so on cannot, of course, have been written by William  Coughlin.<br />I think it is a very sick marketing policy of the publishers to  refrain from ANY refernece on the cover that in fact the book has been  written and/or edited by somebody else.<br />I hope this will stop quickly!	2000-01-09

It is a beautiful description of the growing up from a shy boy to a confident professional of Triton, the servant. It has as a background the  change in the Sri Lankan society and the decay of the ruling class.   Through Mr Salando, Nili and his friends we get a good view on the  differences between East and West. To see the 70's hippie, going to India  to seek whatever it is, suddenly turn up as a very destructive force in the  Eastern cultural fabric is quite hilarious. Above all, it is a beautiful  story, told in a very poetical way and never failing to make the reader  feel part of it.. Finally, the scenes in London are, again, painted with a  beautifully fine brush. I will on my visits to London never again look at  an Asian shopkeeper or restaurant owner in the same way....	1999-11-09

Ok, it's about a lawyer, Gideon Page, and it's the fifht installment in a series of very good legal thrillers, but the lawyering is very weak and the courtroom is only entered  at the end of the book where the reader has already lost his interest for  the plot.<br />The five stars are for a very good and insightful view on the  relations and the character of Gideon. We know him from previous books as  worrying about his daughter Sarah, his girlfriends Rainy and Amy, but in  this book all the spotlight is on Gideon himself. It is a very subtle  description of mid-life crisis. In everything he does he seems only to be  able to concentrate on one thing; on himself. He has no problem, on a whim,  to end a relationship with his girlfriend and also helping his client is  made pursuant to his own vindicative feelings. I can't help liking him less  then in previous novels, but I guess that is always the case when you probe  in the life of your &quot;heroes.<br />Apart from Gideon's own struggles, his  observations of the Arkansas black/white scene are very interesting. The  way he describes the county is completely politically incorrect, but honest  and provoking.<br />For those who have not read any of the books in the series  and who are looking for a legal thriller, do not buy this one but start on  one of the earlier ones. For those who find interest in the Page family;  don't miss this one!	1999-10-10
US	52117779	R2178UO6WBFJKL	0451186141	618654313	Due Process	Books	2	1	2	N	N	simplistic and dull	The book contains all the elements for a nice legal thriller but somehow it never takes off. The characters are flat and the plot is so simple that already after one third of the book it is absolutely clear what happend.  The relationships between the characters are all of the black and white  type. Either they are very nice or they are complete idiots like the judge  and the managing partner of the company. The personal relationship between  wife and husband is of a similar type; they love each other dearly, but  five minutes within the first row the man wants to book a marriage  counsellor... All in all, not recomended reading.	1999-09-06
US	52117779	RJXQHNM924D1K	0425166740	888870051	Hung Jury	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Certainly not brilliant	This is the third novel written by the Enlish writer duo I have read. The first two were indeed excellent, but to call this one brilliant, like mrs.Klausner in her review, is in my view highly exaggerated. The writing  is good and the pace of the novel OK. Therefore I have finished reading the  novel. The storyline is so far-fetched, however, and so improbable at some  stages, that it took some effort to continue reading.<br />The kidnapping of  an Attorney-General is an event which leads to high attention. To survive  street accidents and pursuits in the sewer is quite unbelievable. That the  Prime Minister instead of talking to Judge and Jury ( particularly when the  life of thousands of people is at stake) awaits the outcome and goes of on  his own enquiry is complete bullocks.<br />Also the rigging of the jury  process is so complicated that it is hardly believable.<br />The writers  better stck to the micro-drama they developed in the first books; they were  considerably better!	1999-07-19
US	52117779	R1I3ZBRBH95K9	0671536192	866803613	Until the Bough Breaks	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Exciting read	I don't know what it is with this book. The plot is not overly complex or exciting. Quite early on it is clear who is the protagonist and who the victim. The courtroom scenes are not very exciting and, apart from that,  build only a minor part of the novel And yet...I found it a very exciting  book and read it in almost one session. I think it is the characters which  in this fourt novel in the series continue to be well developed and  intriguing. Even Emma is nice, where the spoiled brats some of the other  female lawyers/detectives are raising, sometimes irritate you away from an  otherwise good story. I am looking forward to the fifth...only I hope Mrs  McGuire will do something about the very sad ( and perhaps undeserved)  ending of this novel	1999-07-01
US	52117779	R395TAYTJB47N3	0380790696	69341112	Playing Dead	Books	5	5	5	N	N	A very good second novel	After reading his first novel, Lover Boy, I was really positively surprised. So I knew what to expect this time and was not disappointed at all.<br />The mystery for me is why Belsky has the main protagonists he has.  Did I find it rather difficult to like Lucy in Lover Boy, the newspaperman,  Joe Dougherty in this novel is downright despicable. A completely  self-centered individual who drops people at a whim, has no sense of  allegiance or principle and sees people only as instruments to use in his  story. In particular the careless way he deals with some of his  &quot;resources&quot; is disgusting.<br />This is in no way a criticism on  Belsky. He has developed this character very well and it is part of this  wonderfully fast pace novel. <br />The plot again is full of twists and,  indeed like most of the other commentators write, it keeps you guessing  until the very end.<br />Well done and to be recommended to everyone who wants  &quot;to escape&quot; for a couple of hours.	1999-05-16

This one is a thoroughly entertaining piece of fiction with an unusual and quite exciting plot.<br />The characters are very well drawn and I'm really looking forward  to the next novel by mr. Kahn.	1999-04-08
US	52117779	R2X8QXS5C4IG8P	0553580884	482330793	The Undertaker's Widow	Books	3	1	2	N	N	A very average read	Like many reviewers I have read and enjoyed mr.Margolins earlier books and am a little surpirsed with this one. The plot is OK, if somewhat simple. It does not take too long to figure out the main culprits, but the issues  raised are interesting. What I find puzzling is that the book reads like it  has been written in two weeks and somehow bypassed a good editor. Some  parts of the story are far too long (like the development of the marriage  between Laura and Quinn or the early court room scenes) and others are an  insult to the readers intelligence, like not sharing the findings of the  M.E.officer with the reader. What annoyed me finally was one of the  recommendations on the paperback cover claiming that &quot;the book reminds  me in many ways of IN COLD BLOOD but in a way it is even better&quot;. That  is bullocks and the publisher should know that.	1999-03-30
US	52117779	R1BVFKTZLPBZUM	080411255X	298905820	Religious Convictions	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Convincing Story	This was certainly not your run of the mill legal thriller. From Stockley we are already used to have sharp and witty observations, but in this third book in the Gideon Page series he outperforms himself.<br />In fact, it is not  a legal thriller at all. The protagonists enter the courtroom only towards  the end of the book and then only for a brief period.<br />It is much more a  story about the relationship between father and daughter. Gideon and Sarah  go through a very difficult time together when Gideon has to defend a girl  who is suspected of killing her husband. Gideon wants to attack in his case  the girl's father, a highly respected preacher to whose church Sarah is  drawn.<br />The doubts of Gideon as a father and the complete lack of doubt  and the righteousness of Sarah are beautifully drawn. A very satisfactory  read.	1999-03-20
US	52117779	R31VYPBMR082HG	0312195419	187915067	Bitter Grounds: A Novel	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Very impressive	This was a very impressive tale covering three generations of women of different classes in the history of El Salvador. Even if you have never been to that country nor know a lot of the history the story is gripping.  The relations between the various women are beautifully drawn and are good  and interesting enough to overcome the sometimes tedious effort to tell the  history of the country. The book contains many jewels of small and simple  things people do for and with each other. The letter of Caecilia at the end  of the book is an example of absolute literary beauty and I will not forget  that scene for a long time.<br />In the best traditions of Isabel Allende and  G.G.Marquez. A book which I not only enjoyed reading but one that I will  give friends as a present.	1999-01-17
US	52117779	RISIZW9X3MNL2	0440224721	532391891	Obstruction of Justice (Nina Reilly)	Books	3	6	7	N	N	Dissapointing sequel in a good series	The third book in the Nina Reilly series was one I had high hopes for. The previous two novels featuring Nina were great court-room dramas with very well developed storylines/plots and characters.<br />All this was missing in the third novel. The courtroom was entered only at a very late stage in the book and only for a brief period. The plot was quite flat and uninteresting and the development of the characters was not what we are used to from this writer team. Nina, Paul and Collier were still there old self ( in a way..) but the rest was not the sort of people I could feel any empathy with. I hope the next one will be better.	1998-08-02
US	52117779	R14WDXVEQB1G5O	0380790688	840148696	Loverboy	Books	4	2	2	N	N	enyoable reading	Loverboy was a real surprise to me. The cover of the book, as bought on heathrow, indicates a run of the mill serial killer police procedural. Instead we meet a not-so-youn-anymore reporter Lucy, who for the second time in her career is closely involved with a serial killer. Only this time she is not the innocent 24 year old anymore and has gone through quite some personal experiences. Her mental and physical stability is really tested in this fast paced novel.<br />The author succeeds in developing the Lucy character in a very nice and appealling way. I am still considering whether I like her or not... He writes in a very tight and compact style wich demonstrates that he must have been a good news editor. Combine this with a very original and surprising plot and you have one of the better thrillers of the year.	1998-05-08
