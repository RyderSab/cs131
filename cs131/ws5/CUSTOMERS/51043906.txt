So summer was brush up time. <br /> <br />Keep in mind that I had some French and despite him saying he had no recall - he ultimatly did have some...I can't say how this would be for someone with no prior French. <br /> <br />This was a very easy to follow program and unlike the rest of the programs it had just the right amount of repitition.  Some programs have either no repetition or so much your banging your head against the wall.  The speed was also very good.  It was easy to follow even on the lessons where you had to follow closely.  The people were clear speaking with good french accents and both male and female french voices. <br /> <br />The lessons are more geared to travelers and adults...not so much to students or the kind of words they would neccesarily learn in French 1 or 2 but it was helpful none the less.  There was much less of the 'getting through customs at the airport' than there was in the other programs... <br /> <br />Over all this was the best program hands down.	2005-09-08

This is not only a nice cookbook but a great concept...that there are shopping lists is VERY nice!<br /><br />I found the recipes to be very easy and very flavorful with minimal ingredients.  Frequently with cookbooks there are many ingredients...way more than I want to drag out on a busy night but many of these recipes have just a few ingredients.<br /><br />I find alot of cookbooks where you are cutting out time or fat or something...make up for what your cutting out by increasing the number of ingredients to boost flavor.  I agree that sometimes that is necessary but Leanne has found a happy medium...  just a few well thought out items makes for an easy and delicious dinner.<br /><br />Many of the foods I would have never tried without having gotten this book and I found I liked them.  Things like kale for instance...I never thought to try it and with urging from this book I did try and found I liked it.<br /><br />I see the recipes as a springboard and I so alter them.  If my family doesnt like one kind of meat or fish (or the called for item is expensive), I will use something else.  If I dont want the set of spices I can use several different ones (perhaps change the mexican spices for herbs de provance)...<br /><br />Its a great book for busy people and you do not need a lot of cooking experience.  The recipes are quite easy	2005-03-26

I read the book after seeing the movie and while they are similar on the surface they are quite different.  My reaction on seeing the movie was that the main characters did not seem to exhibit the charactaristics of their supposed diagnoses....after reading the book it is clear that some liberties were taken.<br /><br />The book is an honest and compelling read, albeit a short one.  I do with it were longer to be honest.  The people in the book do seem real.  Much more real and true than they did in the movie.  I am not saying that I didnt like the movie, in fact I did.  Perhaps it is just that the characters in the movie are just that, characters and representations of those in the book.<br /><br />I found the girls in the movie much more likable (therefore unbelievable) and not what I would have expected from persons diagnosed with borderline personality disorder or a sociopath, for example.<br /><br />I found the book to be a more realistic version of Ms Kaysen's story.  It doesn't make the hospital look like a fun girls sorority, it is clearly a hospital.  It is not a good place to be and it is clearly a place attempting to heal broken people and not a place where the patients are in charge.<br /><br />Despite portraying how difficult the people really were, how unlikable or sick, it is not hard to care about them, wonder what happened to them and feel for them.  I believe that Ms Kaysen did an excellent job telling the story of that part of her life.	2005-03-26

My son read this book and liked it so much he got the book on CD and listened to the whole thing over again.  Its a large book and my son is usually intimidated by books that size.  Once he got into it, he was sorry when it ended!<br /><br />Even tho the CD audio version is expensive its as wonderful as the book.  My son was especially impressed that someone his age wrote it and is eagerly anticipating the second book!  I let him write a review of it.  This is his review:<br /><br />The best book I read this summer was Eragon by Christopher Paolini.  This book of fantasy is an impressive 500 pages however the story is so captivating you can't stop reading.<br /> While hunting, Eragon comes across a mysterious blue stone in the woods.  He soon realizes that the stone is in fact an egg when it hatches into a small blue dragon.  For fear of punishment, Eragon must raise his dragon in secret.  Eragon begins to bond with Saphira, but an evil force soon attacks his home and kills his uncle.  Seeking revenge, Eragon sets out with his mentor Brom to find the Ra'zac while also trying to keep his dragon hidden from King Galbatorix.  Along the way Eragon learns of himself and his place in history.<br />This book is an excellent example of fantasy containing action, adventure, magic, and fighting.  The plot moves quickly and keeps the reader interested in the story line.  Both the characters and the setting are described in great detail allowing for vivid mental pictures.  Eragon's thoughts and feelings are always shared with the reader permitting them to understand more of the character and the problems he faces.  As a teenager myself, I was able to connect with this character and understand his struggles as he faces obstacles and must learn how to mature into a brave warrior.<br />I highly recommend this book to any teenage boy who enjoys fantasy.  I would give it two thumbs way up for being the best book I ever read.	2004-09-22

While I don't think there is enough variety (in models and positions) to make it a great book I have found it to be a useful reference quite a number of times. I do wish that the lighting had been stronger to give  sharper shading in general for muscle definition.<br />It doesn't have the variety or sheer number of options available in the *pose file* series but quite a few pictures are fairly large in this book which is very nice.  If you do find a shot that works for you than this is a very nice book to have.<br />I think this would be a good adjunt book if you already own several.  I wouldn't make this your only figure book or your first one...unless you happen on it and find a figure in here that you wish to draw.  this book isn't an instuction book on how to draw as much as it is a nude figure reference.	2003-12-20

I got this book for my son because he likes to draw dragon ball z caracters very much.  He will do image searches on the internet and print out pics to copy or trace.  For a child like him this kind of book would be good.  The pictures are a nice size and very trace-able.  Ultimately what you end up with is a line drawing that can be changed to suit you or to color as you like.<br />Some people will find that this would not suit their needs though. First, it has the appearence of a coloring book more than a how-to book.  Most how to draw books show color (similar to the cover).  These pics are black and white, uncolored and unshaded.  Second, for a person who can not draw and wishes to actually learn I can't imagine that happening from this book.<br />The pics are done in stages with some how-to information but for a person who actually wants to learn how to draw I can't imagine them even being able to know how to get to step one from this book.  That said for someone with some drawing skill the steps in how to get to a finished picture will be helpful.<br />My son likes this book but uses it more for tracing the figures than to actually free-hand them.  When he is done tracing he will add features or change certain things and than color them.  I think this would be a great adjunct book for a child who enjoys the Dragonball Z theme but as a *how to* book there are many that are much better.	2003-12-19

I do think that there is an expectation of a certain amount of artistic ability from the get go but there is a certain amount of rudimentary skill building included as well.<br />It is a nice large size that I think is necessary for art instruction books and it is also a fairly big book as far as total pages go.  One issue I have with many *how to draw* books is that they tend to be pretty thin.  This is quite a nice size.<br />In the beginning there are a lot of examples of types and styles of features that people have...not in caracature form but just in general.  I like this. I find this very helpful in general drawing as well as helping you focus on what features you can play up for the art of caricature.  Proportion is also discussed with an eye on how to manipulate it.  It is also a great lesson in general drawing.<br />The examples that are used to show what to do are quite good.  there is a  photo (or photos) on the page and the drawing that accentuates certain of the features.  It's very helpful, I think, to start with an actual photo and see how the artist picked up on certain features in his finished drawing.  I do notice that the people selected for photos *do* tend to have obvious traits that are easy to pick up on (a VERY square jaw... A *very* pointed chin...  Large bags under the eyes, etc) I think this does get you used to looking for these things but perhaps a few more examples of less obvious features would be a big help.<br />Over all I like this book very much.  It shows different styles and while the focus is on the caricature it isnt on making the subject look bizarre.  Quite a good first book.	2003-12-19

This a wonderfully constucted (board covers and spiral bound) book that comes with pencils. The book is about drawing and meant to be drawn upon...what a combo!<br />There is instuction in the book but it's subtle and never says *a sky should look like this and a dog like this*.  It's more about the joy of drawing and just getting started than it is about how to draw anything in a line by line way.  A great thing for kids as they get to develope their own style.<br />That isn't to say there aren't lessons to be learned (perspective, shading, faces...showing movement, etc)  The book is set up with small amounts of text and drawings (almost doodles) on the pages with the expectation that you will draw your own designs on the blank spaces.  One thing I just love is that the pictures they included as examples are very sketchy and loose... simple and quickly drawn.  Nothing that anyone would look at and say \\"I could never do that!\\" about.  I think that is wonderful.  I have seen too many how to draw books where the results look nothing short of professional and when I buy them for my son he just looks at them and thinks he could never duplicate the result.  Its intimidating and he won't even try.<br />with this book...  The examples, looking more like doodles, are very inviting and non-threatening.  Almost inviting you to add your own.  Perfect!<br />The text is helpful and humorous.  Some pages there is very little and others...there is more but it's all friendly and conversational.  This is a real winner!	2003-12-19

Currently he enjoys tracing drawings to *isolate* lines and get a sense of what is actually necessary to make the entire picture.  Sometimes this is difficult to picture in his head but with tracing it becomes simple...  It gives him the ability to learn proportion in a *real* way...<br />This book is quite good for what he likes to do as the drawings are of good size and highly colored.  Finished drawings are interspersed with step by steps so when he wants to go from tracing to drawing he will know what steps to take to produce the results on his own.<br />This book focus' on bad guys so there is text on what makes a bad guy bad...and what to add visually to put that point across (yellow teeth, baggy clothes...a scowl..etc)  There are female as well as male villians and the females have the *typical*...errrr.... buxom comic book body type so perhaps for young children this would be a bit much.  It is the typical style tho seen in the graphic novels so if your child is truly into the art form this is a good reference.<br />The text is helpful but not intrusive and the style of it is informal and conversational.  I think it would appeal to a young non-serious set.  There is  discussion of art /drawing issues in the text (proportion issues in comics... what makes male faces male and female female...shading...etc) but I wouldn't consider this a beginner book.  I think there is an expectation of some drawing ability to start with.<br />Overall, this is a very appealing book on alot of levels.  I wish it was longer and that some of the pictures were a bit bigger but these are really minor issues for me and have mostly to do with how my son uses the pictures.  The quality of the paper is very nice and heavy and the color is sharp and dramatic..excellent for the subject matter.  This is quite a nice book.	2003-12-17

I got these for him a good number of years ago when he was first learning to read and I have to say that the subject matter was certainly motivating for him...  He really wanted to read these, really wanted to know what these books said and really wanted to be able to read these to himself.<br />I think that it is a very good thing that children do have some self motivation regarding reading.  If you take exception with the subject that this wouldn't be a good book for you but if you don't mind it...  than it would be a fun book to hook your kids on the fun of reading.	2003-10-31

Overall if you liked *Everyone Poops* you'll probably like this one....just not nearly as much.<br />I have to say that while the whole family really enjoyed *everyone poops* which was innovative and funny in a laugh out loud sort of way this one kind of smacked of \\"how can i do something similar again?\\"  The jokes are somewhat similar in that they are of the body humor variety but with this book they are more of the gross-out variety as opposed to the innovative sort.<br />That said, that kind of subtlty tends to get lost on children.  My son found this book just as much of a hoot as the poop book.  His sense of humor isnt, shall we say, all that sophisticated and *going for the gross-out* in his case might be considered a plus.<br />So while I, as a mom, didn't find this to be anywhere near as good as the other book, I think my son enjoyed it as much and since it was a book for him, I have to say that ultimately it was a good purchase.	2003-10-31

There are many plusses to this book.  That it was even written and is available is a HUGE plus.  It is a message that children need to hear...over and over and over...That it is their body.  That they have the right to feel *good* or *not good* about what someone is doing to it...and that they can say that, LOUDLY.<br />I do wish it was more visually *interesting* as it really is geared to younger childen.  It could use more color to keep up the interest.  Unfortunately, I tended to lose my son's interest when I was reading this...  When he was young a *message book* wasn't strong enough reason to sit still, he visually needed the pictures.  That said, I still did read this when from time to time.  I would just pick up where I *lost* him the previous time.<br />The importance of this message can't be underscored enough and I don't think that the lack of visual *punch* is enough of a reason to not buy this.  On the contrary, I think you should find every way you can to teach this message to your children.	2003-10-31

I have to say that I got this book to read on a vacation...In hindsight, a poor choice.  Reading a book about hijinx and mayhem in professional kitchens while away from home and essentially hostage to them was a scary scary thing!<br />It gave me pause...lots of pause and I came to the conclusion that the only thing scarier than seeing someone drop something, dust it off and use it in an open kitchen was to NOT see what was going on in the closed ones.  Mr. Bourdain really has a way with words and can explain in sometimes grusome detail what can happen on a daily basis ...<br />I enjoyed the glimpes of his past...his time as a child in France....his first oyster, raw.  That he felt set him off on his culinary adventure.  His kitchen job in cape cod...  asking for first aid for a burn only to have the entire kitchen essentially halt to show him the scars and burns that are the badge of being a chef.  And how that resolved him to *show them* that he had what it took...  His time in culinary school... various kitchens...  the things that made him who he is today.<br />The book is interesting for his insights on what makes a good worker..a good kitchen...a  good resutarant...as well as what makes a good kitchen knife as well.  He is also free with the reverse.  What isn't good...  what will never work and what is truly stupid...and who is.<br />I truly enjoyed this book, (scary as it was to think back on how many times I ordered my meat well done...something he tells you not to do, and why)...  I laughed alot despite wondering how many specials that I ordered assuming it was the freshest thing, not the thing they needed to dump the fastest!  I loved the gossip-y and not always good-natured banter of the book..the insight about chefs...  of restuarant staffs and cooking schools.  I loved the whole thing even tho, I will never assume anything when dining out again!	2003-10-31

The material was presented in a way that was more *interactive* and he responded very well to that.  I didn't find the drawings to be very compelling but perhaps the simplicity and *toned downed* nature of them was a good thing becuase some of the material presented was quite frank.  I think there are probably many parents that would find the material too frank especially at the younger end of the age recommendations.<br />I have purchased quite a bit of information for my son on this subject in the hopes that if he was too embarrassed to ask me or someone else he would go to these books.  I have found in the past that material that he was not ready for he tended to just pass over.  Literally, he would just turn the page on things that seemed beyond him...  So in his case I feel comfortable presenting information that might not want to read right than, but know where to find it when he wants to seek it out.<br />This was a very good book for my son at 10 years old.  For some parents and children they might want to wait a few more years and I am sure for some, this material would be too frank to ever be considered.	2003-10-31

I hadn't heard him laugh out loud so much, in a long long time.  It was very nice to see.<br />The book is set up like the others in that george and harold write cartoons through out and my son just loves the cartoons. The main characters were all included although some of them were a bit different than in prior books.  Some of them also had more or less involvement in this book.<br />  I think this book was very heavy on the whole *nostil nugget/mucus/gross out  theme.  At times it was a bit much for me but for him...it was total and complete enjoyment.  He was roaring with laughter the entire time.<br />There are so many books that are hard or painful for him to read in school.  So many books he is required to read that are either a challenge or quite sad... I think it's important that he read books like this to remember the simple joy of reading...  and this book, for him, was joy.	2003-10-29

Ultimately, I am reviewing this book through my own experiances as a bipolar person.  And I suppose I am filtering her experiences through mine which are both more...and less than hers.<br />The books starts at the place where she becomes most *ill*...symptomatic, if you will.  She is prescribed an anti-depressant and becomes manic in the extreme.  The CIA is around every dark corner, sleep becomes foreign and the mundane takes on evil connotations.  It is the discription that is probably portrayed in crime drama prime time television the most.<br />Ultimately, with diagnosis and medication her life evens out (to the extent that a bipolar person's life can really ever even out) and she decides to find her *herd*...  People that she will have the most in commom with... People who are young and successful... People who, I think, she can draw the knowledge she can succeed from.<br />The book is of her travels cross country in her father's SUV interviewing bipolar people who were diagnosed between 16 and 35 years of age.  It is of how they feel, how she feels about them... and ultimately how her disorder intersects with the book and her relationships.<br />I had reservations about reading the book and how it would make me feel.  In the end, I am glad I did.  I think that her observations were astute, non-judgemental, and not self-serving.  I think she was very open and very clear and correct about her observations of *stigma* in our society.  How it affects and effects people, how it's very insideous.  I think she is correct in that there isn't one *bipolar herd* to be found and that people can and do do very well.  That success is an individual measurement and best measured by the individual.<br />I would hope that non-bipolar people reading this book would grap these things as well as other things...  including the courage showed by everyone in this book, just to go on another day, just to try one more drug, just to make amends for things done.<br />I had alot of sceptical feelings going in...  but I had nothing but positive feelings on the way out.

There are very few, if any, books on this type of parrot.  And when I got mine, there werent any.  I bought this book years ago when it first came out simply because it was the only one and I had been looking for one for several years.<br />Even though your choice of information on Senegal parrots is limited, this would still be a great book even if there were lots of other books.  I had had my parrot for a while when I got this book so it was interesting to know that some of her (thought she was a he, till she laid an egg one day :) little quirks are actually traits of Senegals in general.<br />These are wonderful little birds.  A bit bigger and bulkier than a cockatiel but certainly smaller than than the larger parrots.  For a parrot they are reletively quiet (I say relatively because parrots are never exactly quiet).  They can certainly talk and mimic like their bigger cousins (mine does an imitation of the smoke alarm battery warning sound that sends me scrambling for new batteries...and *laughs* just like me).  They can be very affectionate especially to people they consider theirs.  And love to hold things and play with them just like the bigger birds.  As with all parrots there are mess issues and destruction issues.<br /> This book has some behaviorial suggestions that will help you with these things.  For all that are interested in aquiring a Senegal, this is an excellent book to show you what you will need to know.  And for those that have one already, its a great resourse.  Highly recommend this book!	2003-09-12

Many solutions count on containers, cubbies and storage where things remain unseen and stored..for me..in an inaccessable manner.<br />I like the idea that the items are unseen in a way but i find that unseen clutter does not get dealt with.  And just breeds more clutter.<br /> There has to be a balance between visual asthetics and order for an organizing solution to work in my home.  It can be beautifully attractive but if it doesn't *work* in the sense of a long term clutter solution ultimately it will not matter how lovely it is.  I was able to look through this book, and continue to do so, to search for ideas that I can turn into reasonable solutions but the solutions themselves offered in this book wouldn't work for me.	2003-09-06

This book is really a very odd mix of frank erotica in an almost prim and proper stylized world. ( Frankly, the writing style almost feels a bit prim and proper which is a big contrast to the subject matter.)<br />I read this book thinking it was the original, not the *new* one...  It's an odd mish-mash of a story surrounding the personal destruction of a man, his familY...several others.  Although there is an alternate ending scenario that I never quite *got*...  in a chapter after the last chapter.  Bizarre.<br />At a time when I read several Anne Rice books, I decided to read this book thinking it was the classic version.  This book has alot of frank material.  That may or may not be desirable to you.  The story is really a bit confusing and not very interesting.  The characters are not at all likable.<br />I don't see this as a *well written* book.  I think there is too much lacking in the story in general and the characters..The writing style is interesting and feels *elegant* even when the subject matter is a bit more ....base...<br />Perhaps, I would have been better off with the other version but after reading this one I didn't even seek it out.  This book kind of put me off the whole *O* thing...	2003-09-04

It took me a while to figure out that I had gotten a bit more than I had bargined for.  At first I was a bit dissapointed as I was looking forward to the Hawaiian versions of the different ethnic cuisines but as I got into the different chapters I was very pleased with what was included in this book.<br />The first chapter is a nod to strictly Hawaiian cuisine that has limited seasonings and strictly fresh ingredients.  Chapters that follow are :<br />Chinese<br />Japanese<br />Okinawan<br />Portuguese<br />Puerto rican<br />Korean<br />Filipino<br />Samonoan<br />Thai<br />Vietnamese<br />Each chapter talks about cooking methods, ingredients and styles of that cuisine as well as how that cuisine came to the islands....and is very interesting.  The recipes seem authentic to each area.  They could have come out of a collection of ethnic recipes from that area.  Some of the recipes I have come across similar versions of before...like the wonton recipe in the Chinese section (altho this one called for fish cake or shrimp and I have usually seen it call for pork only).  there is a japanese pickle recipe that is quite good and very easy.  There is a very good recipe for chicken or pork adobo in the Philipine section (calling for a few more ingredients than the usual vinegar, and the additions are very welcome).<br />Some things were new to me.  I don't think I have ever come across Samoan Recipes.  The Samoan recipes were very interesting but there were alot of uncommon ingredients (breadfruit, taro leaves, octopus (fresh), green papayas, etc.  Clearly I would have trouble finding some of these items but I really enjoyed reading these...As well as the Okinaowan recipes (thought by some to be the healthiest in the world.<br />The book is a paperback book with a wipeable cover that will not lie flat, unfortately.  The pages arent cleanable and the paper is a bit thin.  The drawings are attractive enough, if a bit mixed in sytles.<br />While this book wasn't what I was expecting, it turned out to be a very nice surprise.  The recipes were true to their ethnic roots.  The ones I tried had *clear* tastes and while some ingredients could be hard to find, many were not.  The additional information seemd to be well researched and I enjoyed reading the *extra* info as much as the recipes.s are attractive enough, if a bit mixed in sytles.<br />While this book wasn't what I was expecting, it turned out to be a very nice surprise.

Quite a few of the *jobs* in this book are simply too big for me, however...I wouldnt want to be with out this reference. Most recently I was having washing machine filling problems. Going through this book allowed me to eliminate some things that I knew could not be the problem which was very helpful.<br />Calling for a repair can be nerve wracking to me. I never quite know if they are telling me the whole truth about what is wrong. In this case I went through the book and was able to eliminate quite a number of things that it couldnt be. The problem turned out to be intermittant and I didn't end up making the appointment. However I did get on the phone with the company that made the washer and was able to talk about the problem....tell them what I thought it was, what I thought it couldnt be..and ask how much the repairs would be to fix any of the possibilities.<br />I am sure the same problem will come up again. And that I will have to deal with it at that time. But by reading this book which has a lot of easy to read, yet detailed illustrations I was able to get a handle on the problem and feel like an informed consumer.<br />The book is a very good shape (a bit longer than wide) so it lies flat on all pages which is essential when you are trying to follow it for a repair. I think this is really a home essential even if you do not do repairs yourself.	2003-08-20

After the forward and the preface is a short poem by some one that does cut...  I'm not going to re-write it here for obvious copyright reasons.  The theme of the poem is matching the feelings on the inside to what is on the outside.  And for alot of people I think that that sums up the whole cutting issue.<br />Its a very hard book to read for anyone who is close to this topic.  It will trigger you, I have no doubt, if abuse issues are close to the surface for you.  It triggered me.  I had to start and stop this book multiple times before getting to the end.  Truthfully, I'm not really sure I have gotten through the whole book, I only know I reached the end of it.<br />It has an interesting mix of professional detachment and painful personal accounts.  Sometimes it is almost difficult to reconcile that they are in the same books.  At times the *painful* just is around the next page and you aren't quite expecting it.  I would say that a great deal of stability would need to already have been achieved PRIOR to reading this book.  And if you had a personal history of cutting...  the longer ago it was...probably the better.  This would be a very hard book to recommend to someone who is actively doing it.  I could see how reading it would give them insight but I don't think that they could acheive the amount of detachment from the book they would need to absorb it without being triggered.<br />This book, no doubt, is important.  It invokes a feeling of community and of not being alone in behavours that tend to be very solitary.  And also of hope and profound healing for me.  All that said, you have to be ready to read this book. Be very gentle with your self always.	2003-08-20
US	51043906	R231XOZMDKGCM	0439138469	243404279	Internet Made Easy	Books	4	2	2	N	N	overall a plus..	I bought this as a summer enrichment book between 6th and 7th grade for my son.  Overall, its a very good book.  He responds better to the more humorous line of scholastic books so this one felt a bit too much like school to him to really *take* to with a whole heart.<br />In school there is an expectaion that the children already know how to search and my son did not.  They are getting research projects in early grades...4th in my sons case and probably younger with no real concept of how to find information.  This book is a good way to start to learn how to find information.  It isnt exactly what I thought it would be...in that where to find the information is on a sholastic web page clearly labeled at the top of every exercise....  that said..its a start.<br />Children are very computer savvy in alot of ways but I have seen my son try to research a science project and get very frustrated.  When trying to find information on dolphin eyesight...it  occured to him to list dolphin eyesight but not marine eyesight, dolphin sight, porpoise, dolphin vision, dolphin anatomy....just for example...<br />I think that this book could have been a bit more helpful in this light.  However I will say that the book clearly states it helps *get kids web-savvy*  not improve their search ability... that was my interpretation.  The other thing is that the children are always directed to a sholastic web page which is noce for safty issues.<br />I wish this felt more like a game than it does...  It feels a bit too much like school for my son to really *enjoy* in a summer-time sense...  I think he has found it to be helpful even if he wasn't overly excited (in a fun sense) about the time he spent doing it.	2003-08-13

I am using this in the summer between my sons 6th and 7th grade year.  It is excellent.  The 15 projects are alot of fun and most projects involve things you would alread have.  Anything I would have to buy would not be expensive (popsicle sticks, magnets, paint, etc)<br />Besides the fun of doing the projects the types of poetry (which are explained) are fun and age appropreate.  The projects are easy to complete and foster a sense of accomplishent.  Besides a disciption of each type of peotry there are examples of that type of poem and an example of a completed project.<br />The directions are clear although with the list of items needed for the crafts, the poem examples, direction steps etc... it might get overwhelming and it might be better for some children to do this project with a parent.  It was certainly more fun for my son to do these things with me than for him to just look through the book and pick one out.<br />It is set up for grades 3-6 although I think it could be broader than that.  Some projects and poetry forms are quite easy and could be mastered by younger children.  Poetry can also be as complex.  There are several I can see appealing to teens (the haikus, the inkblot projects, the magnet poems)  I can see this being a good *whole family* project book.	2003-08-13

This book, that I used this summer between 6th and 7th grade was a great help to get him clearer on this subject.<br />I love this series that uses humor to teach.  It capures their attention and teaches while they are laughing.  The book starts out very basic...  although probably a bit more advanced than he was in third grade.  It starts with *picturing fractions* or as its called *martha crunch, personal fractions trainer*<br />some examples of contents are:<br />great artists of the world draw fractions (recognizing fractions)<br />Louis Lewis, Fractional Private eye ( equivalent fractions)<br />Texarkana Bernstein, the worlds greatest adventurer and her trusty dog, woovis, episode 1 (adding and subtraction mixed numbers with like denominators)<br />Arnold guck: man or myth (ratio)<br />While the message is clearly math, the time spent doing it alot of fun.  So the secondary message is positive also...That math need not be a drudge, that anything can be fun...  that learning isn't something to be dreaded.<br />The pictures are fun and can be colored.  The pages copied if you have multiple children. The answers are in the back.  The book is very readable.  I like that they use a combination of several fonts and boldface types..even within the same page.  I think it makes it easier for my son to read and separate concepts and areas.  Pencils are better than pens or marker as the pages are a bit thin but this book is a clear winner in every sense of the word.	2003-08-13

Scholastic didn't re-invent the wheel with this one but it is a good add-on.  The book states a level of 4th to 6th grade although it might be narrower or wider depending on your child.  Probably 4th grade is a minimum for most children and because word problems tend to be difficult I can see this being helpful for some children into 7th grade.  Frankly, I'm not a math-whiz...the book is billed as a think-aloud book and I did a bit of head scratching (the answers are in the back)<br />The problems are written out so that the stages are spaced.  Nice visual clue to pause and think about the math process going on.  The book takes advantage of several different fonts to suggest alternate thought processes, but I think they could be using more as I have seen them do in other books.<br />The book is set up so that children can do one a day and it isnt overwhelming, that is nice.  The cartoons are very cute.  There is a certain amount of implied knowledge with this book.  Its more a book of exercises than explanations.  That isnt a problem, just a caution.<br />I wish the problems had more *sparkle*...more fun and punch to them.  Instead of wondering how many waffles earnie ate all week based on his daily waffle consumption...  wouldnt it have been more fun to ponder the mess in Earnie's room (complete with a cartoon of Earnie's drowning in a pile of clutter)?  Or how many times Earnie's mom could possibly serve broccoli this week (with a cartoon of Earnie at the table as his cheerful mom puts down yet another gargantuan plate of roughage?)  Or even how many times Earnie's baby sister can annoy him (with a picture of Earnie's adorable yet annoying baby sister?)  I don't know, maybe its me....but teaching my son...or maybe it's getting him willing to learn, has always been easier when he is having alot of fun.  And the more laughs, the more it sinks in.<br />This book is quite good.  It will give good solid problems to solve daily, I just wish it were a bit more to look forward tooook forward too	2003-08-13

It was hard to identify the exact problem.  There was a number of issues compounded by a definate lack of enjoyment factor.<br />These books (and there are several that incorporate humor with learning) have been very good for summer *brushing up*.  While running through flash cards endlessly will help, laughing keeps your spirits up and keeps you interested longer.  My son has some attention issues so once I have lost his attention, I have all but lost the battle.<br />Since I didn't know the exact problem I started with going for the basics.  In the case of this book.  Multiplication skills.  It has a grade span from third to sixth grade.  Its a bit of a wide span.  A bit more mid-range in my sons case I would say...  He wouldn't have been quite here in third grade and had he been proficient he would have been past this by sixth grade.<br />That said, for a child who has struggled having things go very easy at first and building are real confidence builders.  And this book does start out very easy.  Basicly with grouping in the *concept of multiplication* or as it's called *How sheep invented multiplication*...  It goes on through all the steps...<br />for example<br />Three girls named Louise ( multiplying by 3's)<br />Unbelievably amazaing facts about fives ( by 5's)<br />Sevens: we hope we don't win a million dollars (by 7's)<br />The giant times table: the whole enchilada<br />matt debree: non-violent pest control (word problem)<br />corn balls (riddles)<br />buck buckly's big braggin' and estimatin' page (estimating)<br />the work gets harder as the book progresses but it starts out very simply and since the humor keeps their attention I think its easy to build off what is learned.  The main math message is never diluted even though they are having fun doing it.<br />The artwork is very cute and can be colored if your kids want.  It can also be copied if you home school and have several children.  The answers are in the back of the book.  I think this is a wonderful approach for kids who don't think they like to learn.  Before they know it they are laughing AND learning...I wish the schools would catch on to this.eral children.  The answers are in the back of the book.

And there is nothing worse than a reformed anything...<br />I think this is a wonderful adjunt to the book.  My reservation comes from the possibility that something like this would become one more *thing* in an already cluttered home.  However...  this can be a great item and very helpful when used right.<br />Things I have done with these cards:<br />I will select a few and place them around the house in appropreate places...for example on my door at the moment is the one about not buying new purchases without thinking about there you will store this.  It is taped up, at eye level on my front door.  Every few months I will change the cards so everyone doesn't get used to seeing them and *forgets* they are there.<br />I have removed all reading material from the bathroom and left all the cards there, so that I have a captive audience.  My family went thru the cards when there was nothing else to look at.  And the cards are really attractive.  One side has a nice graphic and an overall theme and the other  a more specific objective.<br />I have played a game with my son where we choose a card based on the graphic side only and than turn it over and read the organizing saying.  I am hoping that the repetition of hearing and reading these things will help him over time.<br />I have left these cards on trouble spots (like stairs where people leave there messes) after I clean them.  People seem less likely to drop their clutter on an organizing card than on a blank space...<br />These are just a few examples...there are others.  They were a very good purchase for me even though I had reservations about buying them.  I was wrong...  they are a great item.<br />They have held up very well and are a sturdy stock. Thicker than a playing card, thinner than cardboard.  They appear to have a glossy wipe-able coating, that is peeling just a bit on one card...but as I said, I do tape and untape these cards in different places.  I'm sure it is a function of that and not a flaw in the design.<br />The graphics are attractive and soothing.  The colors are calm and not jarring.  The overall philosophy of the cards is very similar to the books in that you need to question your needs, space and ability before you make decisions and purchases.  I think that is wonderful.  To many organizing items and books throw their own philosophy at you and expect you to mold to it, this author encourages you to find your own.  Bravo!and untape these cards in different places.

And *read* is really a stretch... Based on the interview the author's had alot of valuable things to say...<br />  I looked at the sample pages, the book is much more like the picture samples than the text samples.  Perhaps a book about dressing *is* best done with examples but I am the kind of person who needs at least an equal amount of text example.  I need to read about what I am seeing, as well as seeing it.<br />The style is pretty conversational...  or frank even.  Not everyone who wants to hide flaws will warm up to the whole *big butt* / *no boobs* thing...  I'm sure it will appeal to their target audience and frankly...  I think we need to relax about every flaw we have...if we can laugh a bit about ourselves we will be happier over all...  So I think there is a good side and humor to their style, to relax basicly..your saddlebags aren't the end of the world and can be covered with the right skirt.<br />Ultimately, I think the authors have a great deal more to say and I wish they said it. A book that relies so heavily on pictures as an explanation, won't be my first choice. The pictures are good, but I'm afraid that some weren't as clearly no-nos as they had hoped...<br />The other issue is that what one woman might call a saddle bag another might call a bit of puffiness...  Clearly some of the fashion cover-up issues while important to these woman...weren't dramatic. Perhaps a few examples of...say a mountain AND a mole hill would have helped as opposed to just the mole hill.<br />That said, for the person who learns in a graphic manner this might be an excellent book!	2003-08-13

I got this book after my son brought home a mini-pin in need of a family.<br />While deciding if this little (9 pound) angelic looking creature would be suited for our family it was a good book for an overview on common health problems (some skin problems that she has had, som knee problems that she has not had)...  some behavioral issues with other dogs (that she has had) and that they are one person dogs (which she hasn't had)...that they are very much the *clown* (which she very much is :).  Overall...my point is...the book for it's small size and and low price was a very good intro to my new family pet.<br />I would suggest buying this book prior to buying the dog.

This type of lifestyle change takes a huge committment that most people can not sustain.  That said, some can and do.  For those people this book would be an excellent resourse.  Along with many recipes there are brand suggestions that I rarely see and grocery store suggestions that I don't believe I have ever seen.  She also gives suggestions about products she especially likes as not all fat-free products are equal in taste appeal.<br />I think that this book has an *all or none* slant to fat which may or may not be a good thing.  Some people who could benefit by adding some of these recipes into their diet might be turned off by this approach.  It's unfortunate.  There are good options and choices here.<br />The book is set up as a plastic spiral and the pages are a bit hard to turn.  The pages aren't wipe-able altho they do lay flat.  the cover is cleanable.  The whole package has a *community cookbook* feel.  That might be a plus or a minus depending on how you feel about that kind of book, its a bit more personal feeling.  The illustrations are a bit of a mixed design.  Some more elegant, some more cartoon-ish...  nothing garish...  NO slabs of horrified suet running from a chubby butcher, thankfully<br />The recipes, and there are many will help you makeover your favorites.  Low-fat pizza, quick spicy chile, mexican lasagna, hot fudge pudding pie, etc.  Notably absent are beef dishes.. There are 2.  On the otherhand, in the creamy vanilla frosting there is 3 cups of powdered sugar.  I have to wonder which is more harmful...a small serving of lean beef or the frosting.  To be totally fair...  that frosting recipe is really the exception rather than the rule, most sweet dishes call for a sugar substitute.  I only added it as an example...that the focus is clearly most on lowering the fat in your diet with this book.  Sodium is quite moderate altho some main dishes do hover over 500 mg and some are over 1500 which i consider high per serving.<br />I think this could be an excellent asset for the right person who is extreamly motivated.  I think it also could be great for someone who is looking for ideas to add lower fat dishes into their diet or who is willing to take a recipe and adjust it a bit to their liking (ie, to use spray margaine instead of the suggested butter buds, or egg whites instead of the egg beaters or low fat cheese instead of fat free)do hover over 500 mg and some are over 1500 which i consider high per serving.<br />I think this could be an excellent asset for the right person who is extreamly motivated.

When I saw the title I was a bit put off...there a quite a few books that use *feng shui* as buzz words to rope in suckers looking to change their...well...chi...and inprove their lives...<br />But this many years down the road, I have to say, grudgingly, that there are many plusses to this book.  The recipes are nutritious, delicious and *solid* in a culinary sense and the directions are clear and easy to understand.  The recipes are decidedly Asian in nature.  In my area most are easily available with the possible exception of dashi soup stock and tamarind paste which would require more of a hunt...<br />Several recipes stand out as ..well...outstanding.  Berry balsamic parfaits (try it over vanilla ice cream with mint sprigs, unbeleivablely good)Seared salmon with horseradish butter (actually the horseradish butter is a winner all by its lonesome) easy and delicious.  Chicken soup for a cold is a very good asian soup soup stock with the addition fo ginger and chilies.  Adding your own touches  makes it a whole soup meal for company...  just pass around accompiments...<br />There is a lot of feng shui information in the beginning.  Some I found interesting.  Where is the best place in my home for the kitchen?  What if it wasnt there?  How to set up the kitchen so I didn't eat too much? (okay, i liked that part)...The yin and yang of eating...<br />There are different options on changing the recipes thru out the book, I like that.  And how to serve the dishes.  The book is more square than rectangle and is a hardcover that lies flat (yay!)  The binding is in very good shape after all these years. It does tend to open to the recipes i have used more frequently at this point tho.... the paper isnt wipable unfortuantely...soy sauce stains from earier dishes are here and there.  The color of the paper is a nice off white, very easy on the eyes...  the pages are a bit thin, you can see shadows of the other pages through them.  Ah well, you cant have everything...<br />There is a removeable and cleanable attractive book jacket and the artwrk inside is tastful with and asian flair...  no bok choy running away from dancing knives thankfully!<br />Thinking back to my original objection,  I was wrong.  This was an excellent gift and an excellent cookbook.  It's smaller size would make it an excellent addition to a themed gift basket with an asian flair (like some dried noodles, soy sauce, dried mushrooms, dashi stock, mirin...all inside a big wok!)yes...  the pages are a bit thin, you can see shadows of the other pages through them.

US	51043906	RGPW3CG7E4WGW	1843337088	385666410	A Harvest of Healing Foods: Recipes and Remedies for the Mind, Body and Soul	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Very nice selection of healthy dishes with ethnic touches	This was given to me as a gift.  It isn't the kind of cookbook I would normally grab off the shelf...  But it is a quite beautiful cookbook in a quiet and gentle sort of way.  The spicing to me seems to slant towards the asian in some recipes, the tex-mex in others and indian in others.  So there is a nice balance.  The beginning is an intro to heathy eating with a more holistic approach...not nutrition per se...but integrating your diets with relaxation, energy, diets of the world, etc.  A nice change from rants about sodium intake.<br />The chapters are nicely titled.  Breakfasts are called *gentle awakenings*  Nice ambiance, if you ask me.  The only place that this didnt work for me was with the vegetarian chapter... which was titled *kind cuisine*...I was put off by this.  I like vegetarian cuisine.  eat it alot...but I also eat meat and I'm guessing that is *un-kind cuisine*?  That bothered me...I can see that slant working in an all vegan cook book but in a mixed-marriage cook book, it seemed out of place.<br />So far I have tried Sea vegetable, carrot. snow peas and rice noodles (gotta love that sea weed!) and a few things I rarely try...beverages.  Lime flower tea (WOW!)...and hot cider vinegar with honey (dont know what possesed me, but i loved it). There are many color pictures in this book of prepared items and they are very attractive in a healthful looking, not food stylist sort of way.  Very nice.<br />The book is more square than flat and is a paperback.  The cover is wipe-able and the pages  are more wipe-abel than the usual paperstock...more on the glossy side than not(BRAVO!).  The font is a bit small and a bit light for my tastes...  I think if they made it bolder of darker there would have been a read-thru problem to the next page...  It lies flat (EXCELLENT!)<br />There are some tastful drawings and graphics through out this book.  Nothing that detracts from the lovely photos, nothing garish.  Thankfully, no cartoon tofu running from the happily confused house wife.....<br />Overall this is a very nicely constucted cookbook.  Very classy, with some excellent recipes.  Perhaps not for a *brand new* cook...but not over complex either...  A nice mix of vegetarian (kind) cuisine and meat (un-kind) cuisine...y confused house wife.....<br />Overall this is a very nicely constucted cookbook.  Very classy, with some excellent recipes.

I have had it at least 10 years, long before a low carb life style was thought to be a good thing.  When I was going through all my cook books the other day I came accross this book of generally very easy and some surprizingly elegant pasta recipes some that can be made quickly for company.<br />First the good:<br />With a fair number of these recipes you can produce a hearty comfort-type entree with with mostly pantry type ingredients.  Who would have thought that spaghetti with parsley butter (spaghetti, butter, garlic, parsley) can make a satisfying and elegant entree?  Well I didnt.  But it does.  And it makes and even better first course, lunch or side dish.  The same goes for Spaghetti with walnuts and parmesan (spaghetti, olive oil, garlic, walnuts, parmesan, parlsey...and add blue cheese to this one if you like).  throughout this book are simple put-toghether dishes like this that you can add to your usual stable of week night dinners for variety.  Other examples of these simple recipes are spaghetti with lemon butter and peas, elbows with butter, parmesan and peas, and fetticcini with tuna and peas.<br />On the more exotic side are a rabbit sauce for your pasta, a cavier and pasta concoction and a section an asian noodles.  Quite a few of all of the dishes are on the rich (read calorie laden) side...  One chapter with no cook sauces is a bit lighter.  The dessert section is very sweet and very rich.<br />I think a lot of these recipes could be *lightened up* with alternate products...  fat free half and half instead of cream, fat free  milk instead of milk, egg substitute instead of eggs..low fat cheeses, etc.<br />On the plus side..there are many many recipes to choose from, many with things you already have at home.  On the minus side, without reworking some of these...its a cholestol nightmare (no, not all of them...but a good number)  It fairly easy to read.  A nice font, easy directions.  Suggestions to change the basic recipes...  Alternate ingredient choices.  very nice.  Thankfully no screaming elbow macaroni cartoons running from smiling pots of boiling water.<br />A minus here I need to note...having had the book for so long...Its not exactly a spiral, more like a loose leaf that holds punched pages...but some of the holes have ripped like they would in your school binder.  Or they just dont stay where they should any more.  Essentially i have one ring holding in all the pages now.  Not a good thing for all the pages.  In a few years, I think I will just have pages and that will be just a big mess.<br />Times have changed and tastes have changed.  There is an appreciation for a lighter style of cooking.  Its hard to say if I would buy this when the last ring goes and pasta recipes fall all over my kitchen.  I can't say that this hasnt been helpful, because any cookbook that helps me make a dinner out of what i already have, is a help.  I think I will only know what I will do when the time comes because this truly was  a mixed bag.<br />I can see this being a good book for someone who does alot of pantry cooking.  Someone just starting out because the recipes are very simple (well alot of them) and most take a minimum of ingredients and prep.  Or someone interested in a good volume of only pasta dishes.Suggestions to change the basic recipes...  Alternate ingredient choices.  very nice.

That is always a good sign.  The book is a large book with glossy wipe-able pages (something I love in cookbooks).  It lies fairly flat altho with its paperback binding I am sure after lying flat a number of times on the same page, its bound to crack.  It lies fairly flat towards the middle of the book altho at either end, its more of a challenge.<br />The beginning is a guide to healthful eating with a focus on fresh ingredients, moderate to low fat and lower sodium.  Some dishes would be very hard to fit into a low carb life style as that isnt the focus..altho if you were low carbing with more of a focus on watching your glycemic index this book would work out much better.<br />There are many color pictures of the dishes.  Most full page and opposite the recipes.  There is a bit of an intro prior to the recipe.  Sometimes about why a cooking method was chosen or about an unusual ingredient.  Along the side of the pages are snipits called *cooking clinic* about how to choose produce, or how to preform a technique etc...or a *nutrition note* about a specific ingredient.<br />The layout of recipes is ingredients down one side and cooking method down the other.  I prefer ingredients on top and cooking at the bottom.  I find it less confusing but it is a personal preference.  The recipes take up the whole page so the size of the font and layout puzzles me a bit. It could have been much bigger and easier to read...there is half a page of blank space on a considerable number of pages.  When Im cooking I dont want to be switching back and forth with my reading glasses all the time......That said, they are fairly easy to read.<br />I have tried an enjoyed several soups.  Chicken and orzo, lentil, and split pea.  They were all very good!  Most people, I think would be used to more salt and could add it if necessary.  The roasted pepper sauce is very good.  There is a recipe for lime scallops with orzo that I made with shrimp instead.  It was really very good also..  Its quite low in sodium but the tang of the lime dims your need for the salty flavor.  I didnt miss it with this one.<br />There is a section on what they call finishes... and they classify them as breakast-y, brunch-y...even a dessert.  But they really have more of an appeal as a breakfast item.  Whole wheat popovers with prune puree wont float the boat of many of my guests, frankly.  Other more reasonable dessert choices woule be some of their fruit options.<br />Over all a very good book, with some minor design flaws.  I can see this book fitting in to a number of popular diet plans as well as for the person who would just like to add a few more halthful items to their menusshrimp instead.

US	51043906	R2D1I7D86A9H91	0890878552	79730969	The California Artichoke Cookbook: From the California Artichoke Advisory Board	Books	4	23	23	N	N	Its....cute.....	I got this as a gift and it has its good and bad points.  First, its small (plam sized paperback) that is quite attractive.  Front of an artichoke on the front cover, back of one on the back.  It is put out by the California Artichoke Advisory Board...who knew there was even such a thing?)  Because of that the beginning of the book is full of intersting artichoke history, arichoke lore, basics, prep tips,cooking techniques, eating hints and nutrition facts.  More than I have seen in cook books of 1000 pages.<br />There are 21 recipes that run the gamut of sauces for the chokes to entrees where they are the main ingredient.  There are good discriptions for the recipes, altho no pictures.  Some cute line drawings of artichokes.  None of which, thankfully, fall into the walking vegetable catagory.<br />Risotto with artichokes was very good, but risotto is a hard dish for me and i think it needed a bit more explaination.  I tried it twice once it was too hard and once it was too gooey.  The problem wasnt exactly the recipe, more my problem with correctly making a risotto but the directions didnt help all that much.  The artichoke frittata was excellent.<br />The book is really a bit too small to to just lie flat on the counter and refer to comfortabley.  It snaps shut and if you try to get it to lie flat the binding will break.  On the other hand its very inexpensive so its really a minor design flaw for the price.<br />I can't really imagine having bought this myself.  Its a bit too small to be practical for me..but as a gift, perhaps as part of a theme basket.  Especially a gourmet or italian themed basket with olive oil, pasta, dried basil, garlic braids..etc.  this would be an excellent and inexpensive addition	2003-07-31
US	51043906	R1TG3OVIOQ632L	0895297353	500418590	Secrets of Fat-free Chinese Cooking (Secrets of Fat-free Cooking)	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Love the recipes, hate the design	Okay...first the great stuff!  While dieting, its hard to find many options at a chinese resturant besides steamed veggies and plain tofu without sauce and  with a bit of rice (unless your low carbing..than you can forget the rice, even)  This book has none of the typical sweet and sour heavy gloppy sauces and deep fried anything...  And the food is better for it.<br />According to the author it is more *authentic* to the real cuisine and I can see that she is right.  The recipes smack of healthful trasitional ethnic cuisine...with a bit less sodium and fat.  In the beginning there are some general guidelines for reducing dietary fats as well as a glossary of asian ingredients...some familiar (green onions) some more esoteric (agar-agar)...  and some helpful cooking hints.<br />The book is separated into chapters of soups, springrolls and dumplimgs, rice and noodles, tofu, veggies, meat, seafood, and desserts.<br />The soups that I have enjoyed from this book are the tofu spinich soup, the meatball spinch soup,and the chicken rice soup.  All the soups were very low sodium, probably much lower than people are accustomed to.  Adding a bit more might be necessary for some people.<br />The steamed shrimp dumplings are delicious!  Sodium and fat on this is low as well but you are eating this with a dipping sauce of some kind so it is a highly flavored and delicious dish.  The bai zai chicken is easy and wonderful and also makes a great wrap type sandwich. (plus you end up with a light stock after you have poached the chicken!)  The steamed turkey cakes were a bit odd to me...  I guess Im accustomed to a different texture on ground meat than steaming provides and I don't especially like the smell of ground turkey. There is a shrimp cake recipe that reminds me of a bit of shrimp toast...( the delicious deep fried shrimp on white bread thing)...Its great when I want a good subsitute for that fatty appitizer.<br />there is a resourse list in the back of the book to locate hard to find items.  But the pulication date is 1997 so its hard to know how current that is.  There are however many sites on the internet for delivery of these kinds of items if the ones in the book do not work out.<br />My only problem with this book are design issues.  It didnt lie all that flat and so after several uses on the same page, and trying to get it lie flat the binding has cracked on my favorite recipe pages.  Im afraid soon the pages will be all over.  The pages also arent able to be wiped of spills and are a bit thin, so you can see the type of the other pages thru them.  You cant read it, its more of a shadow, but its distracting to me.  I would prefer a bigger font on recipes that have more, rather than less ingredients..and some of these do.  Im not sure I understand the logic for taking up half a page with a recipe and half with a large cartoon of walking vegetables when a larger font would have made it much easier to read.<br />But....as i have said...overall this book has more plusses than minuses.  It suits many diets as well as just generally tasting very very good.  The recipes are simple and dont require complex cooking techniques or a whole host of difficult ingredients sometimes needed for ethnic cooking.e hard to find items.

The appeal of wonderful recipes enchanced by interesting facts, trivia and gossip-y information on the history of the 21 club is just irresistable to me!<br />The recipes themselves are really simple in contrast to, for example, some of martha stewart's recipes that get complicated by their telescopic travels into the minutia.  In contrast to that the *21* recipes are bold in their simplicity.  (Desserts seemed to me to be somewhat more complex, but than desserts tend to be)  Some recipes fall into the traditional catagory and have been around for as long as the club has been, others are new.  Its interesting to see the appeal of an old time favorite.  I have been toying with the idea of trying the 21 traditional chicken hash for a number of year...<br />I have made quite a few of the side dishes and they are excellent.  The roasted shallots are wonderful with meats and poultry.  Roasted garlic is a classic.  Maple glazed root vegetable is great for Thanksgiving.  I havent tried the meat recipes because I fear that with the simplicity of the dishes the quality of the meat is crucial.  I'm certain that i could hunt out the required grade of beef, if I tried I just havent to this point.<br />The chunky blue cheese and walnut dressing is amazing and the citus ginger dressing is wonderful on asparagus.  There are many *winners* in this cookbook.  But for me the real appeal is the history of the resturant.  What presidents ate there...who was the first woman to wear pants there...who ordered and got a peanut butter and jelly sandwich...things on that line.  Cartoons about 21 dot the book, rememberences are interspersed with wine suggestions...  news stories and even a photo of michael douglas and charlie sheen from wall street.  The 21 club is a cultural icon and this book shows it.  Its the best of both worlds..both solid cookbook and warm memories.<br />The book itself has a very nice size for a cookbook.  More square than rectangle and with a separate jacket cover than you can wipe spills off of.  It lies flat, a must for cook books and the binding has been sturdy over the 4 years that I have owned it.  The pages are not all that resistant to spills and staining will occur, unfortunately they are not glossy so you can not wipe them.  They are bright white and easily read altho a bit thin, you can see the text from the next page thru them (not enough to be especially confusing but .... )<br />This is an excellent addition to any recipe collection. A great gift for the *foodie* in your life or even someone who enjoys the history of NY city, perhaps.rectangle and with a separate jacket cover than you can wipe spills off of.

Or that the advertisers thought these pictures would jump start anyone to actually purchase their product...the mind boggles.<br />But it was a different world back than...and maybe these dreadful combo's had the worldly appeal that.... ceviche...or sushi...or gummy worms have today.  Or the same appeal the the show *a cooks tour* has as we watch tony bourdaine suck down beating cobra hearts...  perhaps considering that, the bacon shake looks almost mundane...<br />I can't help but admitting that I have bought more than a few *vintage* (read: old and tacky and never to be used for anything more than amusement) cook books on ebay...  and i am sure that I enjoy them for the same reason that I just love this book.  A glimpse at another time when I sit and shake my head and say \\"what were they thinking?\\"  but when I read this book, its kind of like having company as the author has a funny running commentary going the whole time...  and I don't feel quite so odd about my fascination for all of these retro....errrr... gourmet treats.<br />Altho I havent bought this as a gift I can see it being a great one for the right person.  Perhaps someone who decorates with a retro twist...someone just starting out in a new apartment and you wnat to buy some cooking tools and a cookbook for (ok, a gag cook book for :) or someone who likes retro martini things..i think this would fit right in.	2003-07-22

I enjoy it for many reasons..first it has a style that I enjoy...A cook book that is more conversational in style..that is to say it goes beyond just a list of ingredients.  There are recipes for soba both humble and complex as well as explanations of ingredients that might be a bit esoteric to the american palate as well as proper serving bowls, cups and tableware.  Even the best places to go (and the cost!) of soba dishes in various areas in Japan...altho with its 1988 publication date its hard to know how current this info is...even so this *peek* into the soba world is fascinating to me.<br />Its clear that soba is light years away from...say .....ramen noodles...in form and elegance.  I enjoyed reading about the tradition and history of this dish.  While I have not made the noodles myself...I have enjoyed the recipes for *hot soba noodles in broth*, *chicken and leek soba*, *soba salad*, and *soba noodles and miso stew*.<br />Most if not all ingredients can be found if you have access to an asian market.  I have had to leave out an ingredidnt from time to time and still have a wonderful result (depending on the ingredient).<br />In this country where *fast food* generally means decreased quality it is so beautiful to see how a *fast* food can be an elegant experience.	2003-07-22

First I found myself cutting down on protein portions due to point amounts so I could eat more of other things...the other things ended up being carbs essentially and I stopped losing weight.  The second was when my father was diagnosed with diabetes and I knew I had to get a handle on my biological ticking sugar-time bomb<br />When I started this diet in June I was looking looking forward to good results.  While this diet has some similarites to other diets (atkins, suzanne somers, carb addicts etc) there are also some very important differences.  This is not a low carb diet... Whole grain products are encouraged after the second week.  It is not a re-do of Atkins...  Saturated fats are kept to a minimum...trans fats are eliminated...  Carbs are not counted and ketosis is not usually produced nor is it suggested...<br />You can have meats, (poultry, fish, and shellfish)of the lean kind...Poulty should be skinless white meat. Vegetables, of course, that fall in the non-starch catagory... Eggs are unlimited unless your Dr. had advised otherwise,. Low fat cheese is encourage, full fat cheese is not used. Nuts are used but not unlimited. The salads, you should have with real olive oil in the dressing. Your supposed to eat 3*normal* sized meals.<br />The first 2 weeks any bread, rice,fruit potatoes, pasta, or baked goods are not allowed but the diet gets less restrictive after that when whole grain products and fruits are added back in.<br />Since June I have lost 21 pounds.  So far it's going very well.. and I am feeling VERY well... As i eliminate the *simple* carbs, my body is more able to determine what a *normal* meal is...  Something I was very concerned about.  I felt, at first, if I could determine a *normal* meal I wouldnt be overweight...  But eliminating the carbs seems to make a huge difference in appitite perceptions.  I also find that I am simply not hungry a lot of the time.  I suspect that I had quite a bit of fluctuation in my blood sugar and that was leading to feelings of constant hunger...I no longer have that with the elimination of sugars and simple carbs.<br />There are similar features between this diet and some others and this diet does have a decent amount of protein as does Atkins, Suzanne Somers, etc...  The difference is the focus on the types of fat in this diet.  The healthful approach used here in fat choice, I feel has overall worked for me.  I tried Atkins several times and never felt good eating all of that fat...<br />I think there are editing issues with the book, probably a bit of a rush to get it out.  There is a bit of conflicting info on the south beach diet site...  but the diet is evolving.  That isn't a bad thing.  New products are added, new ways to use them...  some things might be eliminated over time...  I would rather have this book even with the minor flaws and be minus my 21 pounds than wait for a *perfectly* edited version...<br />There are recipes in the book as well and some are VERY good.  There is a pistacho chicken salad that is amazing...  and worthy of serving to company (i have) for dieters and non-dieters alike.<br />I think that I have found the life style that will work for me always and I encourage people to give it a try.  The first few days are difficult as you cut out your usual starches but after that...  Your body adjusts and is better for it.that I had quite a bit of fluctuation in my blood sugar and that was leading to feelings of constant hunger...I no longer have that with the elimination of sugars and simple carbs.<br />There are similar features between this diet and some others and this diet does have a decent amount of protein as does Atkins, Suzanne Somers, etc...

There is a bit of conflicting info on the south beach diet site...  but the diet is evolving.  That isn't a bad thing.  New products are added, new ways to use them...  some things might be eliminated over time...  I would rather have this book even with the minor flaws and be minus my 21 pounds than wait for a *perfectly* edited version...<br />There are recipes in the book as well and some are VERY good.  There is a pistacho chicken salad that is amazing...  and worthy of serving to company (i have) for dieters and non-dieters alike.<br />I think that I have found the life style that will work for me always and I encourage people to give it a try.  The first few days are difficult as you cut out your usual starches but after that...  Your body adjusts and is better for it.	2003-06-13

Its a good book for little children and regular pages dont hold up well with the little ones...and this one stands up to repeated readings.	2003-06-12

This book gave me the feeling I had when I saw *the matrix* for the very first time. Overwhelmed, in a good way.<br /> It must have been a major undertaking to make this visual *history* of the movie.  The art, altho most isnt full color, is spectacular.  It was a great visual journey that speaks of the movies graphic novel beginnings.<br />I actually bought this book as a special birthday gift for my 12 year old son who loves both this movie and comic art (well, art in general)  It is quite expensive.  The cover price is $60 altho I got it for $50 at a local store.  Still expensive and I had my second thoughts about buying it, especially for my son.  I just felt that the book was very sturdy.  Nice heavy hardcover, large format and thick, glossy pages.  It seemed like a book that would hold up.  An in truth I have spent more on video games for him that he was *finished* with in a few days.  I think this will be a book he enjoys, reads,is inspired by  and learns to draw from for a very long time.<br />In a way this book reminds me of the the *art from star wars* series.  Possibly, those books were a *bit* slicker with their many color pictures, perhaps for more mass appeal.  But looking back, I dont see them to be as dynamic as this one.<br />Honestly, I cant wait for my sons birthday so I can un-hide this book and lose myself in ...well....the matrix.	2003-06-08

I think this book tops what i would consider other contenders for this type of all-in-one cookbook (joy of cooking and fannie farmer)  I love that this book has pictures...missing from the other two books I mentioned.  It's a nice LARGE general, basic cook book.<br />A perfect gift for a person setting up an apartment for the first time, learning how to cook, going off to college (altho sometimes cooking options in college are limited).<br />I love the extra help sections...how to do things...  techniques...  examples  etc.  All around books tend to be at a disadvantage when they try to be all things to all people.  While I dont think there is any substitute for regional and specific food type/cooking method/ ethnic cuisine cook books, I also think there is an important place in everyones home for a general all purpose cook book. ( For times when you want to know the *basics*...how long to cook something, for example.)<br />I have been dissapointed with the fannie farmer cookbook and the joy of cooking...  this book would be my number 1 choice for a favorite general cook book for everyones kitchen	2003-06-06

NOT for the bd/sm subject matter but more for the fact that the first half of the book seems to be running in one direction and about mid-way thru it it takes an entirely different turn.  It kind of starts out as a *virtual erotic club med* vacation and switches to an almost old fashioned simple love story (two people, who against all odds find each other kind of thing)..  Im not sure why I found this so disturbing...probably because neither promise (erotic story vs. true love story) was really ever fulfilled.<br />I suppose either premise would have made a good book.  Ms rice is an elegant writer who can make some of the most unappealing things seem palitable.  Her discriptive style is excellent and you *are* transported where ever she takes you.  Perhaps this book would have been better as two books.  Or maybe its just that the original premise of the two main caracters, their whole personalities...styles..personas all of a sudden changed for each other...and neither seemed to jusify the change in the other.  And I never really got the feeling that either of them was eachothers soul-mate...<br />The first half of the book had more promise as an intriging read probably despite the erotic premise not because of it...but the second half seemed like a modern day romance novel that never did *gel*	2003-06-06

I read this several years ago and have read many more since than, but the details of many of the others seem lost to me while this one, I do remember.  Perhaps becuase it was the first of the kind i read, or maybe just because of how powerful a book it was.<br />I like this book ( and all of Ms. Henley's book) for a variety of reasons.  First, they arent shy on length.  Nothing is more aggrevating than getting into the story, falling in love with the characters and era and than having the story end.  Ms. Henley write books on the longer side and also series *sagas*.  I also like her discriptive language and her ability to make you feel for and like the main characters despite (or maybe because of) their sometimes obvious cahracter faults.  Sometimes romance novels feel a bit *xeroxed*...  like the writer is just changing the names, haircolor, and era and slapping a new cover on it.  While I would have to say that this book fulfills a certain predictable romance *formula* (beautiful, willfull long haired heroine...brooding dark and head over heels in love on the inside, hero....  it really doesnt feel like a photocopy of every other book written in that form.  It feels more like the original, that was emulated.  The details are richer, the writing is better, the readers involvement is more than with many other books  (even some of Ms henleys other books)<br />The love scenes that Ms Henly writes seem different to me than other writers too...  while less timid than some other writers (maybe julie garwood?)  they arent quite brazen either (maybe like some of joanna lindseys?)...  And I am not finding fault with julie garwood or joanna lindsy...Im really just trying to place virginia henley in the love-scene-scale...  I would say that they are more on the more brazen side with the rough edges smoothed a bit by some tactful beautiful writing.<br />The book isnt without faults but perhaps maybe the faults are more built in due to the genre.  The exasperating heroine...  okay, aggrevating sometimes...  The roughness of the hero..  okay, brutality maybe.  Maybe the issues are more due to the features of this *type* of book than the book itself.<br />I would certainly say that if you like romance novels, to not read virginia henley is a mistake.  I think she could write any type of fiction she chose, I love her writing style.s maybe the faults are more built in due to the genre.  The exasperating heroine...  okay, aggrevating sometimes...

There is alot of good information and good simple recipes in this book but the key word is *simple*...  Anyone past a novice is going to already know alot of this information.  Not that everyone cant use the occasional booster or reference guide.  Its just that if you have any knowledge of cooking basics alot of this will be redundant.

I think the recipes are more *family-style* and seem familiar to me from local japanese resturants...  This isnt a cook book of the more esoteric japanese cuisine...but that is probably a plus for an intitial cook book.<br />If you live near an asian market you will have no trouble finding the ingrediants...even alot of the markets now stock most of it.  What I cant find conveniently, I can order online at ethnic grocery stores.<br />This has been a sturdy well made book .  The spine hasnt broken despite repeated reading over several years and being layed flat for following recipes.  The size is good also..its a large paperback.

The whole series.  My main issue with it is that I truly do not think there was enough there for a series.  I think this would have been better story telling as one book.  Thinking back I see the books were meant to be a progression of the heroine...from sleeping, okay comatose, heroine... to strong, self aware sexually mature woman.  I think the fault there was that the *growth* experiences became repetative.  What seemed erotic and totally shocking at the beginning became more of the same to *slug* thru...<br />The premise was pretty interesting as I like retelling of fairytales, with a twist.  And this retelling was particularly twisted...  As with all fairy tales, there was little introspection on the part of the *players*, they are more there as props to get accross a point than they are actual people...  little insight into them...or if there is it takes a long time to get there.  Perhaps that is why it took 3 books for the growth to occur, I'm not sure.<br />Another problem I had was the switching between *voices*...at some times the story is told by one character and other times another...  I'm not sure, since the end result of the story was to be the growth of one character, why there was all of this point of view changing.  I found it intrusive to the story.<br />All that said, this is clearly a frank, graphic and meant to be erotic, if not shocking story.  The story sometimes gets lost in the endless bd/sm scenes... altho that may be a plus for some.  But honestly even erotica loses it punch and gets repititious when over done...  Another reason I think this would have been a better, tighter, smoother read as one book.<br />If you wish to take a *glimpse* on the wild side this may be an interesting read.  If you are easily (or maybe even ot so easily) shocked, steer clear.  The sexual nature of this book begins at the beginning and continues all the way thru.	2003-06-06

It has great pictures to help guide you a bit and information on uncommon (in this country) ingredients.  I have tried several recipes and while I don't consider them *fast cooking*...what i mean is I wouldnt necessarily start cooking them after a long days work...  I don't see them as long or overly invovled.<br />Once you stock up on the traditional ingredients, flavorings, spices cooking this way is much easier. And much less time consuming...  There are a good number of recipes that, once the intitial ingredients are purchased, are very economical (featuring eggs, rice, chicken thighs)<br />The feel of the book is very good.  The pages are smooth and easy to wipe up if you have to, the spine is sturdy (an issue i have with non-spiral cook books) and hasnt broken on me even after two or so years of reading and using.  A big plus for a cook book.  Excellent quality pictures<br />Personally, I like more recipes for cook books...i find this book a bit thin.

I think it was inpiring in a general sense.  I didn't see alot of specific information altho i would admit it is motivating as a whole.  If you are looking for specific and detailed info on feng shui this isnt the book for you...  It is more of a general guide of the subject...which may be okay as you would have an idea of what kind of more specific info you would want to find.<br />I found the author a bit too esoteric for me.  Her chapter, late in the book, about colon clensing just made me say &quot;huh?&quot;  Maybe its just me...but I dont want to read about encrusted, impacted colons...along with diagrams when I am reading this kind of book.  Her point I suppose was that *clearing* you life meant clearing your body as well as you house.  Maybe that is a valid point..  I don't know, I stopped reading the book at that point.<br />Perhaps if the book was titled differently...clear your life wiht feng shui...or something...it would have seemed like a more global *clearing*...  But I think the word *clutter* is a popular word for titles.  Many people have clutter and they need to deal with it... Maybe the titling was an attempt to attract a wider audience.<br />So, even tho I found some value in the first part of the book, I stopped reading when I got to the colon diagrams.  Truthfully, if I had to do it over again, I would buy a book that was more  *on target* about decluttering your house and didnt go off into esoteric  tangents.	2003-05-26

I really like cookbooks that are more than just lists of ingredients.  I think there are far too  many of them around.  While I see them to be helpful, as a textbook is helpful...there is something missing. A heart, maybe..or just a voice...I am not sure.<br /> This is one of those cookbooks that fills that something with the joy of cooking and eating...the sensousness of ingredients and the whole cooking and entertaining experience.  The total non-guilt about the joys of eating...  She seems to look at food the way a young child looks at life...  With each ingredient being a total sensory experience.  Its such a resfreshing contrast from most books.  Just the shear joy of it is contageous...<br />I havent tried any of the recipes yet altho looking thru it I cant see any reason why they wouldnt work.  For me this was was more of a total reading package....as opposed to a straight cook book.  I find her personality all though the book and her joy is contageous.	2003-05-10

It has great martini recipes as well as martini-stories from the authors and others... martini lore, history.  Totally fun if your into the martini thing.<br />The recipes were fun and interesting..some a bit too esoteric for me...but I liked reading them anyway.  And like that they are interspersed with the text instead of in a separate recipe section.  There are some fun martini quotes too..<br />The only drawback, I think, and its minor..is that I just hate the feel of the paper.  The cover is fine but the pages feel cheap and grainy to me. Harsh, even...  It may be a pleasure to read but it isnt really one to hold.  Seems to me a smoother paper would be better, altho probably alot more expensive.<br />That said...its a fun fun book.  Easy to read, in a fiction way, as opposed to a non-fiction way.  It has flow sometimes lacking in non-fiction.	2003-05-10

I am on weight loss program but I am happy to use this cd daily.  For me it isnt something that would work on its own but in conjunction with diet and exercise I am finding it very helpful.

There are so many good alternatives. For example, the internet has many many many drug information sites...including a PDR site. There is a site for people with palm computers called \\"epocrates\\" that is free and infinately updateable...and has wonderful features! It is also much more portable than the PDR book. The pharmacies give out drug information and most will give you a package insert if you ask...and if you push your MD you may even be able to get the office to photocopy the pdr page for you. All of these things are probably better because you will be assured of getting the most up-to-date information...	2003-04-16

Many have few ingredients and maximum taste.  While they are helpful if you have the grill they are excellent even if you don't.  Marinades are a wonderful way to grill, in general.  Some of them lend themselves even to panfrying, depending on the cut of meat or poulty.  While you cant use bone-in meats in the GF grill, you can use these recipes with bone-in cuts and use an alternate cooking method (grilling, broiling or baking for chicken).<br />This was a big surprize!

There are things used for convenience (like canned stock for example) but without the typical convenince foods (like packaged stuffings).  I miss her personality in her books.  The way she is on her TV show, her bubbliness.  I would like to see a bit more personality in her books (I have 2).<br />Sometimes i find her recipes to have a lot of ingredients.  More than I might use in a typical  *week-day* meal.  I think that is part of the trade-off you make when you quick cook...  You need things to replace the flavor of *slow-cooking.  However, I havent had any difficulty finding ingredients for the recipes.<br />As with her other books, there is a heavy slant towards italian and mexican foods.  Perhaps these 2 lend themselves to quicker cooking due to being more *spiced* than some other cuisines...but at this point I would like to see a few less italian choices in her books.<br />Also, in my current dieting state...some of her recipes are just too high fat for me to incororate.  I could alter them but I think the fat adds flavor and some of the flavor you miss from longer cooking times.<br />A few things I like very much are the burgers she *doctors* up to make different styles of foods.  Asian flavors, indian flavors, italian flavors...etc.  This is a great idea for week-day cooking.  I like the curried turkey burgers very much.<br />Also, the soups are great, hearty one dish meals.  Served with a vegetable or salad (her salads are very easy and tasty...and unlike alot of other recipes have fewer ingredients).  Again, with the soups, I think they are heavy on the italian-meditarain side of flavors.<br />I dont think this would be the *one* cookbook I have, if i had tohave only one...but its a great addition to a collection.	2003-04-14

The recipes have alot of flavor.  A favorite is *chicken with 40 garlic cloves*...  Sounds like much too much until you taste it.  The garlic mellows and sweetens.  Its very good.<br />Using spices besides salt, adds alot of flavor.  The recipes tend to have alot of ingredients to make up the flavor lost by the salt.  When switching over to this kind of cooking there might be an initial outlay of money spent on spices but its worth it.  At first, there is an adjustment for most people as we arent very salt sensitive...  due to the amount we consume in processed and fast foods.  As you get used to using less...  you start to taste the *real* flavors in food.<br />Lowering sodium in your diet is helpful for your general health, blood pressure problems and it helps dieting as well.  Excess salt causes you to retain water.  Even if you find the recipes *too* low salt...you could add some.  It would stillbe less than the sodium in convential foods<br />I find the size of the book (small pocket book size) difficult to workwith in the kitchen...  the print is typically small...and the pages will not stay open without breaking the spine of the book...  It would be easier if it would lay flat when cooking...	2003-04-14

I purchased the CD version and 2 workbooks.  I actually listened to the cd's with my partner using headphones...  but we did the workbook separately.  The workbooks are always supposed to be private.  The thing I have to say about Dr Phil is that he gives you  new perspective that you can take away with you... The first thing to work on in the relationship is yourself, not focusing on what your partner is doing wrong.  I found this very helpful as I was all rev-ed up to hear what the other person was going to be doing wrong.  And truthfully the whole *whose wrong/whose right* issue is a no-win situation.  So not starting there was helpful for me.<br />I found that Dr Phil puts things in a new light.  If I am feeling like my partner isnt doing thier half...  I remind myself that in a relationship it isnt really 50/50...its really up to everyone to give 100% not just the 50%...  It was those kinds of shifts in my thinking that i found most helpful.  and continue to find most helpful.<br />I know Dr Phil has his detractors...  In general I find his advice deals with shifts in your thinking becasue what you are doing isnt working in your life.  And that can be quite empowering.  I enjoy his folk-sy style and sense of humor and i have found his advice to be sound and full of common sense.	2003-04-08

Recipes are set up not only as breakfast, lunch, dinner but as 15 minutes, 20 minutes and 30 minute recipes.  The recipes are easy to *read*, everything is set up very clearly and simply.  Points are included as are calories, fat, carbs...and other nutritional info, so you could use this recipe on other diets as well.  Particularly helpful for low fat, low cal, and diabetic diets (altho ww generally uses sugar as a sweetener, this could be adjusted)<br />The recipes are excellent with easy to find ingredients.  Some of the ethnic recipes might require things not normally in a pantry but arent items that are so way out you would never use them again.  There are many full color pictures of finished dishes which i like very much.  (I do wish the paper was glossier as it cleans up easier)<br />This cookbook has followed the other ones i have had in the respect that the recipes *work*.  I have made many recipes from ww cookbooks for company without trying them ahead of time, with no problem.  Also included are *what to serve with it* suggestions.<br />You might find for your *non-dieters* that the portions are a bit small...or a lot small.  Just keep that in mind when looking over the recipes...  The recipes would be great for dieters and non dieters alike	2003-03-18

I think while reading *the classics* is a good thing...sometimes for younger kids just getting them to learn to read for the fun of it is more important.<br />This book, like all the others in the series is funny, irreverent, imaginative and easy to read.  I do wish the books were a bit longer.  I have bought easy to read books only to have my son say \\"I finished it\\" before we got home from the bookstore.  And I find myself thinking \\"why didnt I just let him read it there? or get it from a library.....\\"<br />I think my son started reading these in about 4th grade and its a very good start on *chapter books* They can be daunting at first, when going from simple picture books to actual chapters and books like this series are a good transition book.  The print is very readable, there are pictures in all the books and the fact that its funny, keeps him interested.<br />His reading level is beyond this now but he still looks forward to every new one in the series, just for fun.	2003-03-05

Some chapters are very short and the story is extreamly entertaining for children due to the premise ( adults who are mean to children step on dog pooh put in their path by *the gigglers*)<br />I think it appeals to kids on a lot of levels...  That there is alot of *pooh* discussion...  It happens when mean things happen to children...  It is very funny and while the humor is a bit odd and takes some getting used to (plays on words and things like that)...some of the chapters are very short and a bit like *inserts* about the author...  that all makes it alot of fun<br />I let my sons forth grade teacher borrow it to read to the class after my son read it.  She loved it and the kids loved it.  A few children did have trouble following it she said.  Her students that were *english as a second language* kids had a bit of trouble in some places.  I think that might be becuase of some of the plays on words or perhaps it was the things that didnt seem to fit in, at first.  You do need to be able to follow the authors train of thought which would probably be hard if you dont have a reasonable command of english.<br />Overall, his teacher found the book to be a HUGE success and even those kids who had some isolated difficulty really enjoyed it.  How often do you get your teacher to talk about dog pooh, afterall?<br />Great intro to chapter books.  I would perhaps try this after my child has read one very easy chapter books.  Even tho it goes very fast and is fun...It appears a bit long and maybe daunting for the first one.	2003-03-05

I like ms. somers *chatty* and conversational style of writing.  I enjoy the glimpses of her life in the pictures and anecdotes and I like that in one cookbook or another she gives recipes for her pre-made food.<br />That said, altho this diet worked for many people, it didnt work well for me.  In spite of that I enjoy every new book she writes as the recipes are tasty and womderful.  They have easy to find ingredients and not over complicated requirements.  The *protein* recipes would fit into any low/no carb diet plan as well as some of the most fabulous *diabetic* desserts i have ever seen.  Her focus as a sweetener is somersweet which i have never bought due to cost (and shipping on top of that).  You can use other sweeteners with little trouble in most cases (except foods that need to caramelize are a bit trickier)<br />The diet has food combining aspects as well as it being *for most people* a fairly high protwin/low carb diet.  It isnt considered by her to be low carb and she encourages healty whole grains and fruit....However.... People can lose wieght eating high protein in an unlimited fashion...  The same cant be said for eating carbs.  The fewer carbs you would eat on this plan...  the faster you would lose weight.  The forward is by an MD, dr schwarzbein who has a whole other diet plan...  which isnt the same as suzannes...which is a bit odd, i think.  It seems she is endorsing 2 ways of eating...fully.<br />I do have to say that both plans emphasize *whole* foods and getting *hormonal balance* back in your body while trying to manage insulin spiking.  But the plans ARE different, so i think her doing the forward is just a bit odd.<br />With everybook there is a more detailed discriptin of the eating plan and why it works and why it is good for you.  In all honesty, alot of people buy all her books and the ever expanding section on the diet is redundant.  I wish she would come out with a cook-book alone...with just a brief discription on how to *smersize*...  (in the way that weight watchers give a brief discription before their cookbooks)  There a a good number of recipes in each book, more and more each book.  I think what would be most helpful would be a cookbook, at this point without the redo of chapters devoted to somersizing.discription on how to *smersize*...

There are alot of recipes (over 500) and great color pictures.  The recipres include *re-dos* of some common high fat items ( like sauses, dressings, dips desserts, cream soups) Entrees for poultry, beef pork, lamb, fish shellfish, pasta...  its very comprehensive.  Even thos there are some ethnic recipes the ingredients required dont seem far out and could be gotten in most grocery stores alot of the time.The only thing i have a bit of trouble with is that the points are calculated for *serving size*  but you dont know if that is a cup or a few ounces...or whatever.  It makes it a bit hard sometimes to figure out, when cooking for a family, if you will need to double a recipe to feed everyone.  but that is really a minor point..... there is also a section on breads where the points seem closer to the diet-breads than the regular breads but look womderful. The dessert section is very good and the sweetner seems to be used is sugar, not a substitute.  You could use a substitute yourself...  but there seems to be a general emphasis on *real* ingredients..which is nice.The book itself, being plastic spiral bound is VERY nice as it sits flat on a kitchen counter and makes following a recipe directly from the book very easy.  It is set up for using the winning point system but also includes other nutritional values (cal, fat,cholesterol,sodium..fiber..protein etc)  I can see it being helpful on alot of diets becuase the info is so inculsive.There is a section on nutrition in the beginning and a short explanation of the winning points system.  Certainly not as complete as you would get at a WW meeting...but you will be able to see how many points, for your size, you should be eating.  And there are 6 pages of general point values.

The focus is on maximizing *each* child's personal potental. The message is extremly positive. *EVERY* child has abilities and *NEEDS* consistant re-enforcemant for what they do have as opposed to what they lack...which is unfortunately how alot of school system function. There is information on disabilities but the focus seems to be on each childs *abilities*... and to nurture these abilites . I found the information very helpful. The explanations clear and informative without being difficult to understand. There were suggestions that you could incorporate into your childs education and new ways to look at problems. It helps you focus on where the problems are and helps you to find solutions... Is disruption actually boredom? Is inattentiveness boredom? or is it a signal of a learning issue...or is your child bored and inattentive *because* of a concrete learning issue? And even than it is broken down... is it a problem with memory? is it long term momory or short term? Can your child remember a certain number of facts but past a certain point it becomes a confusing mess? Is it not memory at all...but can your child just not get his thoughts down on paper? There are suggestions for helping all kinds of children. The overall message is that *ALL* children can be productive and positive in their own way and *all* children dont learn well in the typical school environment. Many do not, it seems. I found this book to be very up-beat and not dry. Despite that there is alot of information provided. It is a book i will read more than one time	2002-10-30

I even searched on the web for only a small amount of info...  This book is very good.  It is clearly written with alot of good sandwhich ideas ( not only for the sandwhich maker but also just for sandwichs)  The book is written for sandwich makers in general so the author tells you where the makers varies... what to try with different types.  I found some recipes that sounded very good and others i probably i wouldnt try...but there were many that sounded very good.

I find i keep buying the book and find it helpful and informative.  On the otherhand... i think you need to know that while you are getting alot of info that cosmetic companies dont make easy to find...you are also very much getting her opinions.  I have found it difficult sometimes to sort out the info.<br /> For example, there are many products she dismisses as over-priced and *standard*.  Yet...a few of them i have tried and i *do* see differences in how my skin feels using them.  There must be something past *standard* if i can notice differences.  Perhaps she is a bit biased as most products are *generally* similar but i think she does need perhaps to do some research on how individual users (not just her) evaluate the products.<br />That said... I find the info very helpful when considering a new line.  Many are over-priced and if they dont provide samples free, it becomes difficult to assess them without spending HUGE amounts of money first.  Some products i have bought after reading abouyt them, and some not.  This book is very reasonable priced for all the info it has in it.  That said, i dont think there is that much difference between editions.<br />i have the same issues as other people with regards to her *selling* her products *in the book*.  I have tried them, actually.  Some i like alot...some not at all.  All are reasonable priced though. Frankly i like some products that she panned better than hers.  Some of hers i like *the best*...  but the whole idea of her reviewing other peoples products while selling hers...i dont know...seems a bit conflicted to me.  i felt better about this book beofre she started doing that... and she has a website (cosmeticscop.com) that sends out news letters with info on newly reviewed products.  Subscribing to the newsletter is very good and keeps your info up to date.	2002-09-18

This is definately a book i would get in hardcover.  Its [costs more] but will lst much longer...  the book has changed over the years to keep up with what is happening in *cooking* today.  I think when it first came out there were many many MANY fewer cook-books and it was THE only one some people had.  And in that vein, i think they added things that I wouldnt use this book for... say asian food.  there are plenty of asian food cook books on the market that are readily available.  I dont think i would go to this book to find an asian recipe .... i think maybe they are a bit stuck in the *being all things to all people* kind of book mind-set.  for me, i dont need that... maybe some people prefer to have *all* kinds of recipes in one place...but i think some of the other things have suffered.  what did they have to take out to add that....it seems to me it was a bit of the more classic instructional stuff... im not saying this isnt a good book becuase i think it is.  I'm just not sure in this day and age that trying to be *the one cookbook in everyones kitchen* doesnt deminish it on alot of levels....  i think it will take me some time to figure out.  how helpful it is over time...how many times i refer to it... how often i think to myself that the answer will be in there and it is....	2002-08-05

I read a bit of this book in a book store before i purchased it and was laughing so hard at someof his discriptions of food, i was crying.  On one hand he is recording cultures thru their food on the other searching for what he feels is missing in more modern cultures.  How some cultures continue to honor the *throw-away* type food (pigs ears... organs... feet of any kind... strange creatures of all kinds... fruits that smell so bad you cant imagine eating them until you do...)while others dont eat anything more exotic than dark meat chicken (as opposed to white meat chicken)<br />he cant stand bobby flay or emeral (which is enough for me to feel a kindred spirit to him) yet clearly feels some of his choices are sending him on a similar path... ie...he took his tour looking for these hidden foods but had to take them accompanied by cameras and sometimes had to re-take scenes where he thanked the host several times... it seems to have made him feel less genuine, but he is resigned to it and really funny about it...  his style of writing is converstaional.  its not hard to read this book fairly quickly.  i wish it were longer.  his humor runs the gamut between very dry to wildly slapstick slapstick...its hard to know what is coming next...  he found what was wrong and missing from alot of cook books....the humanity.  with all its laughs... great dishes....dreadful misses.... and of course, palpating cobra hearts!	2002-08-05

It was really over whelming to try and figure out wheere to start when deciding on a cruise vacation... this book helped put ALOT of general info all in one place and it helped me to narrow my choices when picking cruises.  i will say that i didnt end my research with this book BUT...  to go from travel agent to web site... to cruise company brocures.... was overwhelming.  it was MUCH easier to get my bearings using this book, decide on a few cruise companies...iteneraries..and than do *specific* research...  this book was an asset.  Its hard to make informed choices when all your reading is advertising (like cruise brocures) so i thought this book was key to narrowing down my cruise based on what i really wanted....	2002-06-19

This book isnt typical...and a bit hard to describe :)  It teaches things that most dont, particulary about perspective which is lacking in most if not all childrens book.  The artist, Mark Kistler, does vidoes about drawing that i have only seen in my son;s school and his sense of humor comes thru in the videos and the books.  This book teaches basics in a TOTALLY fun way that enables children to imagine ways to come up with pictures of their own...as opposed to most childrens books that mostly only teach one way to do a drawing.  This book releases creativity rather than narrows it.  I think it is a book for kids with some drawing experience only becuase the book is large and as opposed to other books there is a fair amount of text...which might turn kids off...  i thought my son wouldnt like it...but to my surprize its his favorite book...he goes thru it front to back..building skills....  and i see in the things he draws when he doesnt have the book in front of him...that this book has had a positive effect on his ability to imagine perspective, shading...and just his imagination.  great book	2002-06-18

I think its so sad when children say &quot;i cant draw&quot;... when all they need is someone to show them that it is easy and fun!  This book is fabulous for the beginning drawers in your life...i try not to go by the age ranges as people learn to draw at different stages... i showed this book to my son's teacher who was convinced she couldnt draw only to see the pride in he smile when she made a few little fun pictures...clearly she was re-thinking her artistic ability!  the pictures are simple as are the concepts but i think starting with the easy stuff builds self esteem and gives kids courage to move on the more difficult complex things...	2002-06-18

Ed's books on thumbprints...and simplier drawing books would probably be considered the *first* steps while i would consider this the *first and a half* step...  there are more complex (more steps to some pictures) drawings...  there are still pretty easy ones and if this isnt your shilds first book and they are at a stage where they are ready for something a bit more challenging this would be a good second line of art books..  it still is writtne in the same way and there are still easy easy things to draw BUT for those wishing to increase their skill/hardness level..there are pictures with more steps.  the pictures are still broken down into easy to follow steps and it is STILL much easier and more understandable than most art books out there for kids...  and there are so many things to choose from!	2002-06-18

There were really some that i wouldnt even consider eating  BUT that is true of all cook books frankly...  this book gives many options for freezing food  (all at once..doubling recipes... etc)  It gives insights when you have very little freezer room too  (like the top of fridge freezer)  i found this book the MOST helpful on the subject ...i would have given it a 5 if i liked more of the recipes...or maybe if the recipes were written with more subsitution possibilites	2002-06-07

While it doesnt change THAT much from year to year ... i do enjoy getting the new books each year and any new info helps.  This is a great vacation for families and couples but sometimes its hard to steer yourself toward what you really really want to see.  The first year i went there i really missed a lot becuase i really didnt have a good idea of what there was...WHERE it was...or how to get around.  The place is so big...the transportation system can be a bit confusing... the parks a bit intimidating...  I still felt spontaneous using the books...i didnt plan the trip down to the second BUT i did have an idea of things i didnt want to miss...  it made the second trip to disney much better than the first... and much more relaxing actually...  it also has helpful info about restuartant pricing... getting the best price fro disney packages out of disney (not as easy as it sounds)..the times of year when it is the least crowded...etc.  so much info...  WELL worth the money!	2002-06-07

I found this book helpful...  it was one of 2 books i bought to start once a month cooking.  truthfully, i couldnt manage cooking all at once for a month  BUT  there is info about other options..  (doubling tripling recipes) and soon (very soon) i had a months worth of food.  It was REALLY nice to be able to pull out a varity of foods and everyone could eat something different.  I think this book would be helpful in getting started and even if the recipes werent all things you would like there is good info on freezing food in general (ie what freezes well)	2002-06-07

The *organizing book* market is pretty cluttered with a re-hash of the same kind of material just re-worded and re-packaged a bit....but this book really is a new approach for me.  I think it has some solid advice on keeping up with things although... she stresses that cleaning done not perfectly...is STILL cleaning and should be appreciated.  She reminds you that you *arent behind* and to just *jump in* where ever you are... and she can relate, coming from a similar disorganized backgroud...so there isnt that feeling that you are being *scolded*. Her routines are very helpful... but really you just start slow...and build up with them... She's kind of funny too..in a self-depreciating sort of way...kind of the way the tightwad gazette is written, maybe....  Of note: there is some religious referencing in the book (ie God-Brezzes etc) but it isnt something that is pushed on you or part of the program... it is only added as part of the authors experience but if that is something that you dont want to even read about than maybe this book might not be fore you.. personally it took a while for me to get passed it...but i am really glad that i did... this book is truly a labor of love for the author and has been a real help for me so far	2002-06-07

Chef Kathleen really has an enthusiasm that is contagious.  Her writing style is just as funny... its easy to get motivated with her and you do *Feel* with her when you are reading the book.  The first 80 or so pages are the story of how she got to where she is...and than how to go about changing your diet... some people might just wnat to get tt the recipes but i really like *chatty* cookbooks...i enjoy her writing style.. her sense of humor and its easier to follow her diet theory knowing how she got there.  I agree that nutritional info is missing BUT...her way of eating isnt really based on calories or fat grams...etc.  it is about making *smart* choices in general... not about specific grams  which really makes sense over a life time of eating, if you think about it.  you could certainly find the calories or grams of a certain recipe if you needed to tho..by calculating it.  her recipes are really delicious...high in flavor...easy  low in fat...  and it was a fun diet book to get thru.  i cant say that often	2002-04-29

This book is a wonderful book for boys AND girls who are learning about their bodies.  I thought the information was excellent and the way it was presented was very understandable..and more importantly READABLE for children.  There were ALOT of pictures drawn with a cartoon-ish and colorful manner...very attractive and appealing.  Even though the pictures were done in a cartoon format they were frank enough to provide clear information...( some parents may find them *too* frank... but i think it is information that children need)  I especially liked the *mascots* of this book.  2 cartoon caracters that are seen thrughout the book...a bird and a bee (cute :)  one really likes the info and one seems kind of less thrilled....sometimes not interested...sometimes bored...sometimes amazed...  many feelings that kids will have.  I think he is an imprtant little character and gives my son *permission* to feel different ways about the info he is reading...  Besides giving excellent over-all information about growing up, sex and sexual health...the books over-riding message is that \\"you are okay\\" and i think children really need to hear that.  The book does it with words and pictures (cartoons showing different people and how they all look different and are all just fine the way they are)  I gave this book to my son and he didnt read it cover to cover...he read what intersted him...passed on the rest...picked it up some other day...read more...  picked it up on another day....  etc.  I like that he has a book like this available to have when he has a question and for some reason doesnt want to ask me or feels that i didnt give him an answer that wasnt what he was looking for.  sometimes i think he gets embarrassed to ask *exactly* what he wants to know...and the questions are asked a bit crypically... and are hard to figure what he wants to know... if i cant make out what he is asking...and dont quite answer the right thing...i am glad that he has this book to go to	2002-04-29

I gave this book to my 9 year old son... he really enjoyed it.  He skipped around, reading what he was interested in and not reading things that he wasnt.... i saw him look closely at some things...laugh at some things.  he asked some questions.  It opened a good dialog.  He picks it up from time to time and re-reads it.  I will say that it can be a bit frank and some parents might be put off by that... i suggest pre-reading it.  but it may be exactly what you are looking for...the drawings are really charming	2001-09-03

For any child afraid he or she cant draw well.... just buy them this book, and watch how much pride they have in what they can accomplish. This book is very basic and shows little characters you can make with a thumbprint (or circle or blob) but dont let your &quot;limited adult imagination&quot; think that is just a few things... there are TONS of things you can draw!!!!!! and they are very easy.

I really liked this book very much and bought it for my son... I was so excited to give it to him. He has many of ed emberlys books. But you know, he really doesnt like it.... I think i know why tho. This book has many many pictures of alot of things that can be used to combine to make larger more scenic pictures... I thought that having all of those choices was a great thing. I think that my son likes having the pictures larger as they are in ed's other books... and they are also somewhat more detailed in the other books. Now, that said... this is still my favorite ed book... and perhaps my son will like it more in time... I just wanted to mention it is a bit different than some of ed's other books...	2001-08-29

Even tho these books are rated for ages 4-8 i think that is really a judgement call... My son is 10 and LOVES them. There is no set age for when a child learns to draw and anytime you can make a child feel good about something he creates... it is a good thing. I have found that even adults who didnt think they could draw are amazed at what they can do using the books... this is one of the easier drawing books but it is also fun because as kids get more comfortable they can use their imagination and make up their own faces!	2001-08-29

They break drawing down into the simplest parts and teach childre (and adults) how to have fun drawing. When you have fun and SUCCESS with the pictures (and you will!) you can only want to do more and the more you do the better you will get. These books are excellent... and fun. Some pictures are more simple and some books are simpler... this one is on the simpler side of mid level i would say... but it is a starter i would say... nothing very complecated.  These books would be great to have in a class room... i cant say enough good about how much fun these books are!	2001-08-29

That is not to say having the poses isnt wonderful but the lighting varies a bit...if you rely solely on the photos and the lighting is poor it becomes difficult.  I really think that the whole &quot;pose file &quot; series are books that you need to look through before buying...I think you need to go to a book store and thumb thru each &quot;pose file&quot; book to determine if you have the right version...some books are more lighted some are closer up...some are sitting...some more standing.  I think these are expensive and need to be viewed and assessed before deciding about a purchase...although returns are easy at amazon.com  :O)	2000-11-21

The danger , for me anyway, is that sometimes I have been known to &quot;imagine&quot; side effects if I know they are possible.  I think that the PDR is invaluable at times and I will seek to consult it but usually only AFTER I suspect I may be having a problem....that way I am sure I am not imagining side effects because I know they are possible.  The book is expensive to buy and is updated yearly so a volume is outdated almost at publication...that is why I question the people who put so much stock in it.  There are so many good alternatives.  For example, the internet has many many many drug information sites...including a PDR site.  There is a site for people with palm computers called &quot;epocrates&quot; that is free and infinately updateable...and has wonderful features! It is also much more portable than the PDR book.  The pharmacies give out drug information and most will give you a package insert if you ask...and if you push your MD  you may even be able to get the office to photocopy the pdr page for you.  All of these things are probably better because you will be assured of getting the most up-to-date information...	2000-11-20

I got this book for my son who is 9...over the 4-8 age reccommendation for this book.  I knew it would be funny and he would enjoy it...and boy did he!  The book has &quot;boy appeal&quot;... and general &quot;ha-ha-ho-ho's&quot; abound.  We read it the first time for laughs...we will read it again and I will encourage him to see if there is anything &quot;deeper&quot; in the stories.... He really enjoyed the pictures alot.  He is at the age when at school he is only allowed to read &quot;chapter&quot; books so this was a wonderful break and fun return back to picture books.

Hands down the best Disney book...year after year.  I have purchased it for several years now and each time I find it extreamly helpful.  I think that the information is invaluable and I wouldnt think of going to Disney without it.  That said, I think Birnbaum's official book should also be purchased because between the two books you get the most balanced view.  Birnbaum is totally &quot;pro-disney&quot; so the unoffical guide provides the right balance for that... But the unofficial guide can be...ummm... very hard on some aspects of Disney and Birnbaum provides a good balance for that.  The unofficial guide is very hard on the food... I've been there, it isn't as bad as the book makes it sound... in fact most of it isn't &quot;bad&quot; at all.  But like i said  if I had to pick one book it would be the unoffical guide... Birnbaum's book tows the disney-company line way too much to be your only guide	2000-11-15

In general, I think this book might be helpful to give to older kid in preparation to a Trip to Disney.  But, and it's a big but, I think most of the material is a re-hash of material available in Birnbaum's regular Disney book.  I think that a trip to disney is expensive enough without thinking you NEED , yet, another &quot;official&quot; book.  Birnbaum books are the official dinsey books and as such really spout the Disney propaganda.  It is somewhat hard to feel that I got a balanced view of disney from these books, so I always buy &quot;the unnoficial guide&quot; as well.  This year I decided to buy this book for my son... for some pre-disney excitement and to read on the plane.  But I really think that this would be the only reason to buy it.  The information is available in other books and this is a book that could really be skipped.	2000-11-15

As a matter of fact, there is a quiz to &quot;self-test&quot; yourself.  If you are primarily inattentive this test will not be accurate.  In fact, as I re-call the author even says something to the effect if you don't have a positive on this test...you aren't adhd.  Now, I know the field of adhd has changed and grown... and maybe the book just hasnt caught up.  If you are adhd-hyperactive, I can see this book being helpful.  If you arent hyperactive I cant see any help at all... in fact someone telling you you don't have something your doctor says you do have is only confusing.  If you are a woman....&quot;woman and add&quot; is the best book i have read...and there is alot about inattentive type adhd.	2000-11-09

I think you need to balance this book with &quot;the unnofficail guide&quot;.  This book is &quot;the world according to Disney&quot; Only.  And while it is very very very helpful there are hints and tricks and tips that it doesnt address.  It also isn't entirely helpful if you want to stay off of the property or judge &quot;value&quot; of Disney packages and products.  That said,  I still think it is a necessesity.  There are coupons (but they are DATED!), insider information, phone numbers, addresses, descriptions, etc.  This book is especially helpful if you are spending your entire vacation at the Disney property... If your looking for info about what meal may not be worth the price..or might not be good... this book isnt going to tell you.  It is entirely PRO-DISNEY!  That might not be a bad thing  Disney is a great place...but you do need some balance.	2000-11-09

It really takes all the things that  cosmetics companies say in their advertisments and just blows it out of the  water.  Paula is quite honest and her writing style is very good (not  text-book-y)  The book has an incredible list of products and brands.  This  will FOR SURE demystify the claims made by major companies!  Oh and for  anyone interested ....she has a newletter...I think her e-mail is  cosmeticscop.com.... my only issue is now she has her own company hawking  products and she does it in the book...which i think is a little  conflicting.	2000-09-09

Books	5	4	5	N	N	ALL I KEPT THINKING WAS I AM GLAD I'M NOT THIS GUYS DAD...	I think this man is a little taken with himself.  The premise that he  has...that the rich deal and think about money different than the poor...is  most likely true.  However setting up his rich dad (mentor) and his poor  dad (birth father) as good and bad role models is REALLY in bad taste.  I  agree with another reviewer...There are no specifics, just rather long  winded stories.  Maybe that is his point.  That the difference between rich  and poor is in your mind and not in financial formulas, but I'll tell you  this... he is richer by the price of this book and I am poorer by it so....  I don't think I quite have it yet.  My biggest gripe is setting his father  up to look somewhat lame... I just think it's in poor taste.  I think alot  of people did get alot from this book.  I just felt it wasn't specific  enough and the author was too impressed with himself.	2000-09-09

FIND THAT HAVING IT IN ALL IN ONE PLACE A CONVENIENCE. Truthfully I found  most of this information independant of this book while searching for  various PDA downlaods.  That made me a little discouraged about having had  spent the money for this book.  This book also comes with a CD but  again...with downloadable programs the CD is redundant.  The book also  doesn't tell if the program is FREEWARE or SHAREWARE which personally I  think is VERY VERY important.  I am a new user and trying to stay with  totally free software applications at the moment.  Also for as big as this  book is I think there could have been many, many, many many more programs  included!!!  I don't know how the softwear was picked but I do know that  while checking a visor site for incompatable software some of this software  was reported incompatable.  Now this is only reports by some users and not  all are confirmed....but it was enough to give me pause.  In anycase.... if  you want a book on USING your visor this IS NOT IT!  Try &quot;VISOR for  DUMMIES&quot;.  If you want links to software for your visor try the  handspring.com website.  If it is easier for you to have it in one book  with a CD included this maybe a good resourse for you but honesty I don't  think this book was a very good bargin.	2000-09-05

I am a new user and MUCH of the info in the book I wouldn't have without  the book.  Maybe I would have figured it out eventually, by fumbling thru  or locating it on the help data in the COMPUTER (DESK-TOP NOT THE VISOR)  HELP TOPICS. And I am  talking about simple issues... for example I  downloaded a game program the first day I got the VISOR and wasnt able to  delete it the way they describe in the instructions with the software.  This is one of the issues I have with the book.  If the companies would  inclide PROPER documentation with their equiptment half of the dummies  books might be obsolete...Now I grant you that the writing in the Dummies  books is more fun to read than any manual I ever read BUT manuals are also  free.  I think the company should be providing you with this info.  Another  problem I had was the author refered to several other &quot;dummies&quot;  books he wrote...including i believe the &quot;palm&quot; book stating alot  of the info was the same.  I don't know about you but if I had the palm  book and I was reading that the book I just bought was pretty much the same  as a book I had I would feel pretty foolish for making that purchase.  He  also talked of other books he wrote in the same sort of computer genre...  couldn't tell if he was trying to blow his horn or get me to buy another of  his books.  Another issue... In the book it was stated that there was a CD  with the book.  I didn't get one.  I don't know if this was an edit problem  or the CD was missing but it doesn't look like one was stolen so I think  maybe that line was just left in the book by accident. OK  OVERALL I LIKED  THIS BOOK  IT LISTED PLACES TO DOWNLOAD SOFTWARE FOR YOUR VISOR AND HAD  MANY HELPFUL HINTS AND TIPS.  ALSO IT WAS VERY HELPFUL WITH GRAFFITI.  IT  JUST GALLS ME THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO BUY A BOOK THAT INCLUDES MOSTLY INFO  THAT I THINK THE COMPANY SHOULD PROVIDE FOR NOTHING.  I THINK YOU SHOULD  BUY THIS BOOK BECAUSE YOU NEED THE INFORMATION IN A CONVENIENT FORMAT AND  NOT ON A COMPUTER...I JUST THINK IT'S A SHAME YOU NEED TO BUY IT AT ALL.I THINK YOU SHOULD  BUY THIS BOOK BECAUSE YOU NEED THE INFORMATION IN A CONVENIENT FORMAT AND  NOT ON A COMPUTER...I JUST THINK IT'S A SHAME YOU NEED TO BUY IT AT ALL.	2000-09-03

Birnbaums is total  &quot;Gung-ho&quot; disney and the unofficial guide i think goes a little  too far in the other direction.  I think they are farthest apart on  food...From Birnbaum you'd think you could eat your fill of good to  excellent food at moderate (or at least value/for money) prices....from the  unofficial guide it seems like you couldn't find even a decent  grossly-overpriced meal...that is why the truth lies somewhere in the  middle. If I had to choose one I'd probably choose the unofficial guide but  I think you would be missing VALUABLE information.  I had my whole trip  planned before I left...reservations, plans (albeit loose ones), an idea of  what was good for kids, what parks were closed for repair (yes that  happens! something that wouldnt have ocurred to me without this info) and  what places i wanted to be sure to see and what i could do with out... It  was also nice to know where all the bathrooms were!  These things may not  seem like much...but believe me they are major when you are with chidren!  These books are necessary and save you from saying &quot;if i only knew  than what i know now...&quot;  now if they were only one book instead of  2...	2000-08-29

I think that  this may have been possibly because I had been to Disney before and  pre-planned everything using the unofficial guide and birnbaums guide.  Between those 2 books there is tons more information (altho possibly more  than you may want to trudge thru)than in this book.  I found this book kind  of gimick-y i suppose.... but i do admit that it could be a huge help for  those who have never been to disney and dont want to sift thru information  from multiple sources (like the 2 books i mentioned)	2000-08-20

A very good balance for birnbaums book is &quot;the  unofficial guide to disney&quot;  between these 2 books you get an  excellent balance.  i planned my vacation using both of them... and i wasnt  sorry.

But I was fascinated by the history and  especially by what it must have been like to suffer migraine symptoms (ie  hallucinations) in earlier days...Were these people called insane?  possessed? witches?  Yes, I believe they were.  I learned alot about this  complex range of symptoms and it helped me recognze symptoms  earlier...there by getting more effective treatment.  Some of this book was  dry (it is afterall a medical text) but overall I found that the good  outweighed the boring.

Even though he has had it for a few years and can read books that are more difficult he still enjoys this one.  It's the story of a class that is planning to exchange pen-pal letters with an other school.  But there is much more to the story .  It teaches about learning  to get to know someone before you prejudge them and how boys and girls can  become friends.  It also is about friends, bullies, and maintaining  friendships out side of school with writing.  It's a really great book.  The art work is charming and my son thinks it's a scream!  This would be a  good book for either boys or girls.  I feel it is also a good transition  from books with only a few words per page to longer books.  Even though  there are 48 pages  there are color pictures on everypage so it isn't  intimidating.  I think this would be a nice book as a gift before a child  goes to sleep away camp because it talks both of making new friends and  writing letters to stay in touch.	2000-03-31

At this dinner they have many courses and each course brings changes in the ghost apperiences.  If they were to have grape juice they all turn purple etc.  My personal favorite is the swiss cheese but you'll have to buy the book to see that !  My son  loves this book.... it's like reading it again for the first time everytime  he picks it up.  It is a great halloween gift!	2000-03-31

It was published in 1997 so it isn't the most recent of books however it is a good resourse.  I didn't find it to &quot;techy&quot; to read.  Also it is so important to understand your illness that if you run across  concepts or words that you aren't familier with it is really important to  familierize yourself with them for your own knowledge.  Knowledge is power  in managing your own health (and your own healthcare)	2000-03-29

There is considerable historical information.  While you might not choose to read this cover to cover, it also makes and excellent resourse book with EXTENSIVE indexes in the back for subjects,  other places to find info etc.  I don't think you can possibly be too  informed when it comes to your own health care.  This a wonderful adjunct  to any library, personal or otherwise.	2000-03-29

UNDERPANTS BOOKS...	I think that there should be more funny books for children.  Children like to laugh just as much, if not more, than adults.  And laugh he does!  The other thing I like about these books is that he enjoys them so much that he  was able to make a transition into &quot;chapter&quot; books  painlessly...Which prior to that he found intimidating  A+ for captain  underpants!	2000-03-29

It can be intimidating to order food of other cultures and having this book helps alot.  While I know that the resturant  staff TRULY do their best to describe menu items there can still be  problems (i.e.  busy staff, language barriers etc.  I found this book able  to make my dining much more enjoyable as i can experiment with new foods  while avoiding something that I am not interested in eating at all. ALSO  NOTE: IF YOU HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO EAT JAPANESE FOOD BUT ARE TOO  IMTIMIDATED BY ALL THE CHOICES, NAMES, AND INGREDIENTS THIS BOOK IS FOR  YOU.	2000-03-28

The recipes are generally simple to prepare, cost effective, and delicious.  Many come from families with missonary experience who have become used to cooking in very frugal ways.  Alot include things they  learned from the countries that they visited (ie  working with less  expensive cuts of meat, working with grains and vegetables as a meat  alternative, family tested recipes that have stood the test of time)  It  was really a joy to read this for the most part.  I like a cookbook that I  can &quot;read&quot; not just cook from.  I like the little  &quot;blurbs&quot; about the evolution of the recipes...as well as most of  the info in the beginning of book.  There are some religious references  that at times put me off however the the rest of the book was such a  delight that it really was not a major detraction.  On the whole I enjoyed  this very much!	2000-03-25

Workbook for Boys	Books	5	79	79	N	N	I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE AN EXCELLENT INTRODUCTION FOR MY SON	ON THE CHANGES THAT HIS BODY IS, AND WILL BE MAKING, IN THE COMING YEARS.  As the mother of an eight year old son I found that this book answers questions that he has now as well as things that will come up for the next few years.  He was not intimidated by the language nor the subject.  The  format of the book was excellent and written in a very readable way for  boys.  The drawings were helpful to him as an adjunct to the written  discriptions.  I also found that the health aspects were much more stressed  than the &quot;sexual&quot; aspects.  I appreciate this very much as I feel  that this has been neglected in some of the prior books for maturing boys.  I am glad that there is a book such as this that i can give to my son with  confidance.	2000-03-25

He enjoys reading and re-reading them. He's had them for about 2 years now and continues to enjoy them!  We take them in the car and they are perfect to read quietly or to read outloud and make your parents laugh out loud!  The only problem with this book series is that there aren't more  of them :-(  This series makes wonderful birthday gifts....	2000-03-24

THE AUTHOR PUT HERSELF IN EVERY PAGE AND	is a witty, charming, unassuming, moral woman who found a life-style that fit with her beliefs on many levels.  Many people do not have a life plan at all.  And even if your not interested in many of money-saving tips  you will come away with a new respect for the need to step back from your life  and examine if it meets your goals.  When are you going to need a car?  house?  college?  childcare?  a wardrobe? furniture?  This family made  decisions based on goals that they had....and they were able to meet them.  I was left with the feeling that i could too.  Now having said that  I  find Amy to be a very funny writer and her gifted little cartoons only add  to the fun.  I find all of her information, even if not directly  appropreate for myself, to be challenging, fun, and creative.  and i think  we could use creativity, as a society, so much more! do your self a  favor....buy this book  even if you don't use many tips (and i think you  will) the ones you do use will be worth the price of the book.  It's a  great book for newlyweds, first time apartment dwellers and kids going off  to college!	2000-03-24

The book is entirely visual.  It is one continuous picture that changes in perspective by &quot;ZOOMING&quot; in on a part of the prior picture.  It's like looking at a snow-globe....than being in the  snow-globe....than being in a picture IN the snow-globe.  The artwork is  fascinating and the ability to pre-think the work as a whole would have  daunted me if i were the artist...  What a gift this book is. I bought it  for my son but it has made a much more incredable impact on any adult i  show it to.  if you choose this book you will NOT be sorry.  And it makes  and excellent gift for a person &quot;who has everything&quot;.  I think if  i had to be stuck on a desert island with one book this would be it!	2000-03-24

She was laughing so hard in fact....it made EVERYONE in the room laugh hysterically.  That's the amazing thing about this book...on one level it's about teaching children about their bodies... teaching children that  pooping happens to all of us and all animals.  On an other level there are  some open questions promoting thought.  On another level the art work is  colorful, accurate, and humorous to children and adults.  This is how the  book brings adults and kids together....with humorous illustrations and  simpley chosen words.  its a winner	2000-03-24

The text is totally understandable, discriptions are clear and concise, and the names(if there are more than one for a particular  item) and reccomended brands are a tremendous help.  Truly, I have ALWAYS  wanted a book like this one.  After reading it I feel I have a new  appreciation for asian cuisines as well as the ability to be more  adventurous when dining out.  This book is written with love and respect  for the ingredients, the process of cooking them and the peoples of asian  countries.  It is a winner all around.	2000-03-22
