But this book did not do it for me. i thought Peggy was too much of a contradiction within herself one minute telling Owen he should fight, next minute getting upset when he does stick up for himself, and i thought Owen was a little bit too much, too nice, too trusting, too sweet if i don't like that in a heroine why should i like it in the person who's supposed to the basic hero of the book, it was a simple book, i thought a little too simple it din't particularly have a light feeling to it, instead had a somber feel to it,and instead of leaving me with that fuzzy feeling, i ended up feeling a little sad.	2002-05-31

Also the reasons why Lance was cynical were really not explained in a believable way and so i was left feeling a little let down.	2002-04-09

It was a good effort but i really did not see what all the hype was about.	2002-02-22
