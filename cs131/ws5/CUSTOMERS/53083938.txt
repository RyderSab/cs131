The author does not mistake socialism for totalitarianism. Historical socialism is the religious belief that if you steal property from every individual and hand it to the state (who defines the state?), people will magically become better human beings -- all will be egalitarian, err equal.<br /><br />Socialism is state religion forced on the individual by its believers. Simple. Stealing any form of property from those who earn to hand it out to those who did not is pure theft. Look what has happened in China when the communist priests (The Party) finally allowed capitalism (ownership and merit) into China. Marx is wrong.<br /><br />Socialism should be treated like all religions, no one has the right to impose their religious beliefs on another adult.<br /><br />\\"Heaven on Earth\\" proves it.	2005-10-11

Apparently the difference between a criminal act (theft) and moral redistribution of income is 1) who you steal from (stealing from the wealthy, of course, is moral -- according to Rawls and Bolsheviks), and 2) who receives the loot (the non-wealthy makes it moral), and 3) who commits the act (the state/society, of course also makes theft moral; example - taxation), and 4) your intentions (redistribution of income). To look at this another way, if your neighbor breaks into your house and steals your money, that's a crime (unless your neighbor is poor -- which would then be moral and Justice, according to Rawls' formula). If the community comes into your house and steals from you, it's legal and moral Justice, again, according to Rawls. Because, according to Rawls, if, before you were born, you were to vote with everyone on how physical world society should be structured, you'd vote to have the state guarantee that everyone was equal, or they would be compensated somehow for being born (unjustly) less-equal. How? By compensating those with less by stealing from those with more. So those with more would be like oh, say ... a milk-cow who gets milked to serve those with less. So those with more would become a resource, or state-owned slaves to those with less ... because \\"society\\" (the Robin Hoods and Rawls of the world) deemed this as moral Justice. Rawls does not take into account those who are willing to take on risk, entrepreneurs, students of life who work to earn an \\"A\\" vs. students who earn an \\"F\\". He points out that many people are born into difficult situations through no fault of their own. True. But that does not implicate those within society who are born into better situations as the cause, nor are those who are born into better situations responsible for making up the difference. Forcing the \\"wealthier\\" ones to be accountable for the unfairness within life and pay the bill isn't Justice or moral. It would simply be an unjust law. Some people see Rawls' theory as a blueprint for a future generation utopia (like the Bolsheviks envisioned Marxism). I see it as an insane blueprint for slavery, and a powerful dis-incentive for earning personal reward and merit. In a sense, this book is an argument against the individual. It sees the world through a blurred lense where the author only recognizes masses of people -- he doesn't recognize any individuals (unless they were born as victims). Curious. How do you experience life ... as a group-mind (an oxymoron if there ever was one), a collective? Or as a unique, isolated, independent, individual? There should be societal incentives to help each other. Okay. But when it is forced (theft of property always implies force), it is no longer an issue of morality or justice -- it's simply a law. Without personal choice being involved there is no morality as an issue, by definition.

Much more natural than Syd Field, or, God forbid, overly-Dramatica. Sequences break a story into eight manageable, bite-sized chunks, like chapters, instead of trying to break it up into 3, very large and very intimidating acts (Aristotle's \\"beginning, middle, and end\\" -- what the hell does that mean? Aristotle's advice equally describes a story and an elephant. Useless). Each sequence addresses a specific dramatic question in your story (sub-questions of the full, 3 act story), sets up the question, builds the conflict and resolution, while increasing the dramatic tension toward your full-story climax. The book provides examples from known movies, and explains dramatic techniques you may not have read before. This is an excellent book. Goes deeper into story building than many other books. Too many writers seem to forget the 1st Commandment of story writing: seduce the reader/audience into wanting to know what happens next. That's it. That's the bottom line for story writing. Any writer or writing teacher who snubs their nose at the 1st Commandment is full of B.S.

The author of this self-published book presents his unchallenged, psychological theories about movie symbology. Not symbols regarding character development or story development. But symbols about what actors call the 4th wall, the one that separates the audience from the stage (many actors quickly forget they are on stage to entertain and present a story, not to socialize with the audience. I think the 4th Wall is a French/Marxist idea: separating the workers from the means of production. Very thin). I won't explain, too strongly disagree. If you think seeing a blackboard, or a business card, or a blank page on the screen is going to make the audience recognize that shape as a sub-conscious symbol for the screen, and it will somehow bring audience and movie closer together, then this book is for you -- and so is the writer's block that it will generate in your conscious mind. If you think playing amateur psychologist to your reader/audience is the wrong direction for learning about the art of story writing (as I do), then spend your money more wisely on Bill Johnson's book, A Story is a Promise, a much better book Psychology has its place in understanding and explaining the behavior of your characters. But second-guessing how the audience will unconsciously perceive the symbolic meanings in your story is the apogee of pure BS. Let the French play that game. It's difficult enough writing a good story that an agent or a Hollywood Script Reader will accept and recommend to their boss.	2004-01-18

It does give you a lot of great and useful how-to information that you won't find in other books, but it does not show you how to build a story that will span 2 hours. The authors don't like the formula gurus too much (such as Syd Fields, they do like some of Truby's ideas), and they do offer their own ideas using conflict building as a tool to build a story. But they do not provide a model that uses their ideas to span a 2 hour story. To me, this is a glaring omission. Saying you have a better idea, but not providing proof, is useless. Story structure (and the Guru formulas) exist to help you successfully construct 120 pages of story. To me, this book is missing the author's approach to this critical requirement for any screenplay writing book. If they had supplied their own approach with a model, this would be a 5 star book.

Lenin, Trotsky, and Stalin were Sociopaths who had the good fortune to obtain their dream: overthrow a nation against the will of the people and murder everyone, men, women, and children who didn't want to become insects without individuality, feelings, or soul; which is how communists envision people, not as individuals, but as mindless machines used to fulfill the party's goals, or get crushed. Read quotes from Trotsky and Bolshevik poets who dreamed of a day when humans would no longer need to think as  individuals, but become a faceless mass of radios tuned to the same station waiting for a message from the party as to what to do that day. A reviewer below suggests for balance, read Trotsky! Gee, and while you're at it, read Hitler's apologist justifications why he just simply couldn't help himself, and  just had to murder millions of Jews, Gypsies, Christians, for the Fatherland and the Party! What reeking hypocrisy! Bolsheviks, Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, Mao Tse Tung, communists are all Sociopathic, hypocritical monsters who spoke on a little more sophisticated level than Al Capone.

However, the title lies. It does not contain 1001 programming tips, unless you consider all of the steps in a first course Visual C++ programming class as tips. I don't. To me, a tip is something you want to learn after you've gotten the basics under your belt. The book does go into depth about a lot of material that you won't find in any other beginner book. For example, reading how to add text and a bitmap to a toolbar button in the MSDN is unnecessairly confusing. Whereas &quot;1001 Programming Tips&quot; clearly shows you how -- and it worked. So on a level of completeness, it is an excellent book for beginners, intermediate developers, and a good reference. It is also a well written book.	2001-04-20

You will be able to do and use everything Robert LaFore describes. He is a world class author, clear, intelligent, non-patronizing, non-condescending. One of the best C++ explainers on the planet. C++ is a complicated language. Some programmers suggest that complexity implies chaotic -- which is why we have such dumbed-down languages as Visual Basic and Java. If you find C++ challenging, read LaFore! C++ is the most powerful langauge on a computer.	2001-04-20

Unfortunately, itdidn't deliver. The author is long on good intentions, but short ondelivering useful information. He tries to cover everything: software lifecycle, teams, process. But covers nothing in-depth. This book is more along the lines of the One Minute Manager - about as useful as taking a one minute course on C++ or calculus.	2000-03-30
