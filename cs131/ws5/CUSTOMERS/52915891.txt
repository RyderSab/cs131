However, for those seeking deeper meanings, Alfred Huang's work explores the mathematics, origins, and deeper meanings of the trigrams, hexagrams, and patterns of the I Ching. <br /> <br />There are looks at the different arrangements (Earlier/Later Heaven) of Trigrams, the Lo Shu and He Te diagrams and their relevances.  Discussion of King Wen's arrangements of Hexagrams.  Mathematical analyses.  Speculations.  And far more. <br /> <br />Any student of the I Ching, simply, needs this book.  If there's a flaw to it its that it will leave you wanting more depth in a market that's often quite shallow.  You could reread this book many times and each time find something new.	2005-09-27

It's not overly unified, but the texts themselves range from the interestingly philosophical to the practacal. <br /> <br />However, this is not a book for the casually interested.  If you're interested in meditation, Buddism, and Zen, and have some experience, this could be a useful addition if you're looking for some general reading.	2005-05-15

Some are effective, some are frankly, derivative, some are complex, and some are simple. <br /> <br />Mr. Hon's work is simple, effective, and on target.  His goal is to provide a series of meditations to bring health and balance to the 5 organs of Chinese medicine and the \\"Triple Burner\\" via special sounds, and additional meditations. <br /> <br />His work is focused, yet chatty and even informal, as if he's talking to you directly.  Instructions are clear and concise, and he's willing to use metaphors and simple language to make a point, even if they may seem silly (trying to explain how to make specific sounds is rather complex without using examples).  I've rarely seen instructions done this well for relatively complex exercises. <br /> <br />If you're interested in Taoist healing practices and healing sounds, or just general health meditations, this is a book well worth reading.	2005-05-15

It's a series of studies and analyses of data of different issues (cheating, drug dealing, parenting, crime) vaguely tied together in a chain of discussion.  What makes it stand out is that its a book on how one can analyze information, how people easily make mistakes about things that are relatively simple to analyze, and how incentives (unexpected and planned) have effects on people. <br /> <br />Think of it as something of a travelogue as the author wanders through various interesting areas of human behavior and points out things you never expected. <br /> <br />From cheating in No Child Left Behind to what makes a good parent, gun control to crack, the authors show how an eye on good math (not even complex math, necessarily) and understanding how incentives may work can lead to a new understanding of situations.   Find out how teachers inflate score tests, when Sumo wrestlers are cheating where its expected, that a good parent is more who you are than what you do, and the affect of abortion on crime. <br /> <br />The book gets 4 stars instead of 5 in that, frankly, I'd like to have seen more in it.  It's a surprisingly quick read, if interesting, and I'd like to have seen some more lessons learned, more studies summarized, and so forth. <br /> <br />If you're into psychology, economics, or sociology, it's definitely a worthwhile read just to test your preconceptions and get some new ideas.	2005-05-05
US	52915891	R2A3F5KT74ZTMO	1904853072	545248801	Pop Culture Magick	Books	5	15	18	N	N	Interesting, Insightful, and Pioneering	The first thing you notice in reading it is the book is remarkably tame and sane. The author, who can calmly discuss how pop culture characters are in a way like new gods or comic book layouts can give you magickal ideas, does so in simple, sane, and academic style.  It has the feel of a straightforward, unpretentious lecture more than anything else. <br /> <br />The book has three major concepts in it: <br />1) The idea that belief empowers popular culture figures and this belief provides power. <br />2) A modern occultist can find inspiration in popular culture. <br />3) Occultism is usless if you just talk theory. <br /> <br />The book goes through various kinds of popular culture, looking at specific and general ideas the author has derived from them, exploring the practices the author has done himself, and giving exercises and suggestions for people who are curious.  To the author, whatever resonates with someone has occult potential. <br /> <br />What is presented is therefore a mixture of actual application by the author, suggestions for the reader, and an exploration of useful ideas and concepts.  This is a hands-on book that sets up basic theory, then jumps right into activity.  The author, in short, encourages you to get out there and get to work. <br /> <br />Between the occult advise, there are also some fascinating insights on Pop Culture, media, and more.  There's no small amount of psychology and sociology in the book, and some interesting concepts about Pop Culture are introduced. <br /> <br />Its hard to rate this book as there's nothing I've quite seen like it.  So I give it a 5 for the mixture of sanity and truly thinking outside of the box.	2005-04-24

From Frued to Marx, Jung to Blake, it's an amazing trip through explanations of &quot;us,&quot; and served as my first introduction to concepts of cybernetics and feedback in mental and information systems.<br />If you're involved in psychology, social work, programming, writing, anything that touches on the mind and information, get it and read it.

It's dry and depressing reading (about halfway through I had to take a break), but its also informative.  These are the real deals, and they aren't pretty.<br />Though this will not be the greatest book you read or the most helpful, it's still very, very useful.  It's good as a compliment to more helpful material, but the useful collecting of data and the attempts to be unbiased earn it 4 stars instead of 3.	2002-11-27

Actually, it's quite fascinating reading, though this is definitely a geekbuy for the scholar of magic, mysticism, and religious trends.<br />Simply, this book takes a largely complete necromantic manual and analyzes it in context of the time, history, and what the owner may be like.  The manual in question thus becomes a touchstone for understanding a period in time, traditions, and ideas - and how they came to be.<br />It does so quite well.  There's a myriad of marvelous insights, informative information, and catalogues information, all tied together in comprehendible ways.<br />If there is a flaw, its that the manual is included in the book - but with no translation!  It's clearly aimed at scholars in that regard, but I have to wonder if a translation would have made it more useful in general.<br />Despite this flaw, even if a near half of the book is in latin, it's really quite an interesting buy for a scholar of such things.  If one has read the other books in the series, then this one is definitely worth it for its well-done contuinuing scholarship.	2002-10-07

This book is not going to be the only Quigong book in your library.  However, it is a useful one.<br />Simply, it's an introduction to Quigong in various forms, from exercises to medicine to martial arts.  It's not the most consistent book, and there are times where one may wish for more detail or less.  However, there's also enough good material on breathing, exercises, history, and what to expect when you get deeper into Quigong that it's worth the price.<br />If you're an experienced practicioner, it's probably not worth your time, though it may be good for helping others start out.	2002-08-10

When everyone's talking Quigong and Taijiquan, etc. what's one more book about our Chi, energy bodies, etc.?<br />In this case, this is a book that is no-BS, gets down to business, and gets the job done.<br />Forget new-agey claptrap and people who sound like they've seen too much Dragonball Z.  The author's history is presented, a quick guide to Chi and other energy issues, then straight into the exercises.  There's no bragging (though the part on the author that was written by someone else gets a tad grandiose), no pointless buzzwords, just instructions on a useful series of exercises for health and well-being.<br />To add to this delightful book, it has advice any good master would give his students - warnings of what not to do and reminders that self-development is something that takes months to get off the ground.  The author fully believes (and perhaps demonstrates) the mystical powers of Quigong, but he admits that one can harm themselves if they're not careful and warns that there's no substitute for hard work.<br />I'm not even through all of the exercises completely, and I've noticed significant improvements in my health and well-being.  As a person with a sceptical nature, I'm convicned this book is 100% worth it.	2002-06-17

It has a variety of interesting and useful essays, and is well worth repeated reading and comparative studies.

Not exactly a work of intense research, both an analyses and a testimony, it is best thought of as one man's confrontation and analyses of Christian Fundamentalism on a historical, personal, and spiritual level.<br />Bawer's thesis is simple - Christian Fundamentalism in America is a comparatively recent phenomena that largely ignores the actual words of Jesus, is obsessed with control, is often shallow, and is socially and psychologically dangerous.<br />Bawer examines this from the rather interesting perspective of a committed gay Christian who is obviously very, very serious about his religion.  There's a passion here to his work that gives it, despite some flaws, an honesty of spirit.  Bawer really, really means what he says and is honestly concerned with people.<br />Bawer treats us to a history of religion and Fundamentalism in America that's extremely eye-opening, especially concerning modern day assumptions about what Christianity is and has been and how religion has functioned in America.  Revealingly, America has proved to be far more religiously diverse and dynamic than many suspect - and that today's idea that Christian means a vaguely right-wing personl obsessed with hell and judgement is an unfair picture of American Christianity and Christians in general.<br />Bawer then analyzes modern occurances in highly revealing ways - information we've seen before, but again given his passion, his testimony, he helps put things in perspective.  He addresses sexism, racism, and homophobia of course, but spends a great deal of time on greed, materialism, selfishness, and less-discussed aspects of pathology in Fundamentalism.<br />However, don't expect modern secular/liberal/pop culture to get off easy.  Bawer blasts the spiritual and cultural emptiness and ignorance of our culture with equal passion.  He makes the case that our culture's shallowness and ignorance is dangerous, and is a place where Fundamentalism can take root.  He also notes that, essentially, many of us belong to subcultures who were blatantly ignorant of cultural and social changes and lack-of-changes.<br />Is it a perfect book?  No.  It could have been longer and had more research, especially on psychodynamics.  But did it reach it's goal?  Yes.  It's a heartfelt, passionate work on one man's research and experiences.<br />Will some be offended?  Doubtlessly.  But I think they'll be offended because Bawer is speaking honeslty and from the heart about issues people don't want to address.  Simply, he argues Fundamentalism has hijacked Christianity at the betrayal of its principles, leaving a wake of pathology and intolerance, and spilling into politics and modern life.  Certainly as we've witnessed time and again, people convinced God (or the equivalent, such as Evolution or History) is on their side will do the most terrible things.  In an age of incredible weapons and a connected world, we can no longer afford to assume we're perfect.<br />This book somehow gives me the image of Jesus going after the moneychangers in the temple - this is a man honestly, egolessly offended at something horrible.  Indeed I found myself, a non-Christian, finding myself actually feel close to Christianity for the first time in over a decade.<br />Should it be read by non-Christians.  Probably.  Should it be read by Christians?  Definitely.	2002-05-16

Most of these tales come from her childhood, and have that feeling of listening to the very storytellers she listened to.<br />No attempt is made to reconcile the stories, they are merely presented simply and effectively.  So you'll meet Immortals who ascended to the Celestial spiritually and others who perfect the pill of immortality, sages and politicians, ner-do-wells and royalty.  This provides a wonderful view of different stories surrounding these colorful and interesting characters, presented without attempts to bend them to a mold.<br />Eva Wong has translated many documents, but this one, from the heart, is as important, stimulating, and interesting as anything that's passed through her capable hands.

It's as close as many people will get to sitting down and shooting the breeze with the actor about life, film, and television.<br />Quite simply, this is one man's story - but like anything from the heart, you learn a lot about quite a few other things - and in this case, most of what you learn about is film, television, Holywood, and the fact that acting, when you get down to it, is difficult work that doesn't make most people rich - if they stick with it at all.<br />Find out how the Rami brothers started.  Read about Bruce's love of acting and the hardships he endured for something he really enjoyed.  Get the dirt on Evil Dead.  Read about the ups and the many downs of movie and acting careers.  Get a little insight into how Hollywood has changed over the years.  Read about the horror of special effects and makeup.<br />If you've ever enjoyed Bruce Campbell in a role and want to get a glimpse of the non-glamorous, real side of Hollywood, get this book.

The idea of analyzing Batman as a serious cultural icon may seem laughable - until one realizes that there is some sixty years of history to the character and his companions.  Batman has been there through most of the 20th Century, so there's something to analyze.<br />This is not a pop culture book - this is an analysis of culture.  Serious, insightful, footnote-heavy analysis.  This is not for the casual comics fan - this is for people who love comics and their culture and want some insight into that culture and that history.<br />This book analyzes batman in &quot;blocks&quot; of time.  From the creation, to the war years, to the 50's, the 60's, the 70's, and beyond.  Examples of interpretations, misinterpretations, and historical impact are given, at times in incredible detail (such as panel-by-panel analysis of a comic issue).<br />Without giving anything away about the book, this analysis looks at how Batman came to be, what themes have endured, and how the times have (and haven't) affected him.  Most interestingly, the &quot;dark eras&quot; of the comics Inquisition of the 50's and the controversial pop-interpretation of the 60's are examined in detail - and some startiling revelations and interpretations are made.<br />The problem with reviewing this book is that I can't do it justice and don't wish to spoil the readers.  However, simply, if you care about comics in general or Batman in particular, and like to understand the deep issues of culture, buy it.  Buy several - give them to friends.  It's worth it.	2001-01-29

Either way, the Fifth Elephant is a darn good Discworld novel, and though maybe not the best in the series, has some of Pratchett's best work.<br />This is definitely Pratchett at his best - humor, cultural  speculation, political though, and interesting metaphors.  He juggles more  characters with more depth than ever with Carrot, Anguna, Vimes, Sybil,  Cheery, and Detritus, and introduces some interesting new characters (plus  a herd of Igors).<br />The plot is a bit convoluted, and some of the red  herrings smell after awhile, but then again its essentially a Watch novel,  and those get pretty complicated.  It has some of his more darker and  realistic writing, which actually enhances the storyline - comedy, drama,  and observation are more seamlessly integrated.  I can't really call Fifth  Elephant a comedy, as Pratchett's style has integrated them into something  I can only call &quot;Humorously-themed observational drama.&quot;<br />Is he  back?  Pratchett never left - just like the Fifth Elephant and certain  baked good, you have to know what to look for.	2000-04-11

Rincewind is up to his old tricks (mainly running away), we  get much more into the mind of the Unseen University's leaders, and even a  bit more of Mrs. Whitlow.  The jokes are funny, the plays on words the  usual classic pratchett, and the writing solid.<br />However, the plot really  just isn't that interesting, for what there is of it.  There's some  beautifully mystical and emotional moments, but it just doesn't hang  together to produce much plot.<br />Unlike most Discworld books, which I'll  reread, I doubt I'll reread this one.

If you study Taoism, or if you must have  one copy of the Tao Te Ching, this is a must-have.	1999-12-21

Though I think no translation is ever perfect, this version is overall accessible, useful, and clear.  It  also lacks some of the pretention and New-Ageiness of other translations,  which is a welcome relief.<br />Some people are not happy with Needham's  commentary, but I myself largely don't read commentaries beyond translation  notes.  It's  a must-have for any person who wants a good copy of the TTC.	1999-03-31

There are excellent notes, summaries,  explanations, and histories to compliment the document.  I wish they had  been present in the earlier translation I had dug up.<br />After reading the  Tao Te Ching, read this before moving on to the Chuang-Tzu, Lieh-Tzu, or  any other Taoist document.  It's worth it - and in the spirit of Lao-Tzu,  not too long or wordy.	1999-03-31

Unfortunately, for the person who is new to Linux, you will easily get lost, as there are few definite directions.  What there is,  instead, are summaries, histories, and bits of advice, which don't always  hang together.<br />The book does have useful information - but if you're  looking for an A-B-C installation guide, this isn't it.	1998-11-13

The Fools of the Motley Fool are experts at  it.  When you do the math, you'll find you can beat the market by a few  percentage points at least, as long as you take the time to do the math and  hold on and wait for your investments to grow.<br />This book sets down  several simple theories and explains why they work.  They tell you were to  get statistical information, how to compile it, and how to adjust things.   It's simple, straightforward, and useful.<br />If there is a flaw, its that it  doesn't always take taxes, fees, and other options into account.  Taking  control of your money isn't for everyone.  However, for those that want to,  this is a good book.	1998-09-17

A translation of the remnants of two early  copies of the book, it provides new insight into the classic, as well as a  good translation.  The text of the original documents are reprinted, and  commentary is made on the translation, particles, likely meanings, etc.   Commentary is made on popular interpretations and ways of organizing the  chapters.  For the casual reader, a &quot;comment-free&quot; copy is  included in this book.<br />An excellent resource for scholars, philosophers,  and those interested in Chinese history and language.	1998-09-01

The translation seems to be so-so, and though it tries to be modern and thus relevant, some of the attempts to be modern fall flat and untrue.  The commentary at the end is virtually useless and far too &quot;Western.&quot;<br />However, this is a useful &quot;e-z-read&quot; Tao Te Ching if you have read other versions and thus know where the author got fanciful.  The spirit of the original does shine through, but only if you know where to look.	1998-08-10

From the Star comes Charm, the power to alter reality, to create great works, to avoid the Tides that steal the dead and unconcious.  It is at the top of the universe, a place of wonders, and marvels.<br />It is also a place in danger.  A cruel and evil man has returned from beyond the dark Gulf in which Irth hangs, seeking revenge against those who cast him there.  He brings warriors from another world, immune to Charm, a petty man drunk on power, planning to conquer the world - and worse - with the power of a god.<br />Flying cities fall.  Thevies conspire.  A nobleman flees to find love.  Young royalty seek vengeance.  Those marked as man-beasts make alliances, and the Dark Lord plots while a mysterious sage contemplates why this is happening, and knows that it can be blamed on a tragic death so long ago . . .<br />This is, simply, an impressive novel.  It has its own mytholog! y, own physics, own religion, own ecosystem.  It could practacally be a documentary - from the economy of hex-gems to the sexual rituals of two religious groups, the detail is astounding.<br />Unfortunately, it is a rather distant novel.  The emotional impact of various events and characters, except for the brilliantly detestable Dark Lord (who is shown to be every bit as petty as many Earth tyrants), produce little reaction.  There is a lot going on, but I found it easier to hate the villains then like the heroes.  It's easy to produce visceral disgust then like, admiration, relation, and so forth.<br />Still this is a novel worth reading, for the sheer breadth of imagination.  Not perfect, but for a first entry in the field, utterly astounding.	1998-08-04

It's not just flying saucers and bigfoot - there's plety of other strangeness that is interesting and disturbing.

However, as she does her research and is dealing with terribly unpleasant subjects, I think it can be understood.<br />This is not a pretty book, but it is a coherent one.  Each chapter is an essay on a different time in Christianity, how it evolved, and its affects on Western (and other) civilizations.  A consistent history is shown from the early days of Roman Christiandom to current attitudes that is informative and unsettling. Quite simply, current problems and attitudes today can be traced back hundreds, or even thousands of years, and the history of the Church is not as simple as some make it sound.<br />  Quotes from various sources paint the picture reasonably well, though this book could have easily been twice its size.  If read with an open, critical mind, you'll find flaws, but you WON'T be the same.  It's an excellent jumping-off point to study the parts of Church history people don't want to talk about.	1998-06-28

It's not a language like C++ that has evolved over the years and has widespread devotees using multiple platforms and tools.  Forunately, this book is a decent introduction. <br /> On the good side, you'll get a crash course in everything Delphi, from designing forms to building ActiveX controls.  Very little space is wasted and quite a bit is achieved, leaving one reasonably confident in basic Delphi development. <br /> However, if you're not a programmer, the book could probably seem to gloss over things too quickly.  It's expected you understand why ActiveX is important, etc.  Chapters are included to try and introduce one to OOP, etc., but they really seem out of place. <br /> The most glaring omission is NOTHING on error handling.  Instead of trying to add some failed focus on the new programmer, adding error handling and other information would have been welcome. <br /> Overall, I felt the book was worth the money, since I program in other languages, I could fill in the gaps.  However, this is NOT for a new programmer who wants to learn all the basics.	1997-12-18

In other words, you can follow every fad, or use some thought and realistic goals. <br /> The book walks you through various investing ideas, from the simplest to the more complicated.  Most of it is based on doing your math and not following fads.  There's good numbers to back up the ideas as well. <br /> The book isn't perfect.  It can be a bit unserious or a bit arrogant.  Still, it's a good starting place, and a bit of a boost to show you that you can control your investments.	1997-12-16

If you need an introduction to ActiveX and COM, then you'll be happy until somewhere after the middle of the book.  This is a useful, extraordiarily detailed introduction to ActiveX/COM, bogged down with an eventual mixing of terms, technology, and purpose. <br /> The book leads one logically from the principles of COM, to simple COM objects, and a full-fleged ActiveX control.  These early chapters have proven very useful, covering COM-by-hand up to effective use of MFC/ATL. <br /> Unfortunately, the book then slides into extreme complexity (and some early chapters were rich with uneeded information).  We needed more clarity and more appendix. <br /> This is not a bad book.  It was worth the money to me.  It's just that I felt like the authors forgot that this is an introduction halfway through.	1997-11-24

There's little wasted space, just solid, useful information. <br /> Each chapter focuses on a specific element or elements in an HTML document and how CSS alows one to alter the appearance of the elements.  In general, the chapters are clear and concise, though the chapter on fonts and text formatting is a bit overwhelming.  There are useful examples provided that are very helpful. <br /> The only flaw in this book is that more examples of complex pages were needed, and the final chapters are largely focused on the future, tips, and miscellanea.  More examples would have been appreciated. <br /> I found this an excellent introduction to Style Sheets, despite some flaws.  Well worth the price for any Webmaster wnating to stay knowledgeable.	1997-11-19

Nanny Ogg and Granny Weatherwax, the Lancre Witches, are suddenly out one member of their coven.  What's a wise crone and a many-times mother to do without a maiden to flesh out the female trio? <br /> Unfortunately in Lancre, it's hard to find many qualified women, and the only one close enough moved to Ankh-Morpork, a city whose major industry is greed.  However, with a little manipulation from Nanny, it's off to Ankh-Morpork to seek Ms. Nitt, aka Perdita, a potential witch with an amazing voice and a desire to do something with her life. <br /> Of course, if you have an incredible voice, where do you end up?  Opera!  And, of course, what would an Opera House be without ledgends, rumors, superstitions, and a strange masked figure lurking about?  Well, safer for a start - and Granny and Nanny are determined to figure out just what's going on in the life of their hopeful recruit. <br /> This novel is both a parody of Phantom of the Opera, and a more realistic portrayal.  The &quot;Opera Ghost&quot; is both who you'd expect AND who you wouldn't.  There are hilarious and subtle parodies, mixed with serious looks at how we percieve people.  Best of all, Pratchett's Phantom of the Opera parodies point out what I've always felt - that in the musical, most of the characters were complete idiots. <br /> If you love Pratchett, buy it and read it.  And if you know someone who liked Phantom, and doesn't mind starting a series in the middle, you may have a way to introduce them to Discworld . . .	1997-11-13

It's a reunion of sort, with a lot of the old Discworld gang. <br /> Usually, Rincewind stories are not that insightful or deep, and sadly less interesting that those of the Lancre Witches, the Night Watch, etc.  Fortunately, Pratchett combines his thoughtful insights with the usual story of how-many-times-can-Rincewind-escape.  One gets a look at cultures that become too withdrawn and too traditional, and contrasts them with the barbarian honor of Cohen the barbarian and his &quot;horde&quot; of aged barbarians.  There are also several charming insights into just how revolutionary things we take for granted are. <br /> Not the best Discworld novel, but definately a cut above some of the other Rincewind tales.	1997-10-29

Pratchett's Discworld novels are consistently amusing, often touching, and brilliantly creative.  Men At Arms manages to be all these things and more . . . <br /> The misfit Night Watch we met in Guards, Guards!  Is in danger of becoming almost respectable.  Carrot and Sgt. Colon have new recruits of all shapes and sizes.  Captain Vimes is retiring to become a respectable gentleman as Sybil Ramkin's husband.  What could go wrong . . . <br /> Well, this IS Ankh-Morpork, a city so corrupt that if the gods took vengeance on it, no one would notice.  Things get complicated when an exploding swamp dragon, a mysterious invention, warring guilds, and an assasin who is NOT killing for pay send the city into more turmoil than usual.  Who can save the day?  It's up to the flattest of flatfoots in the Night Watch, and their new recruits to set the city right, or at least not so wrong. <br /> There is the usual Pratchett wordplay and humor, as well as the thoughtful emotional interplays he has developed over the years.  There's also an interesting mystery at the center of the whole piece, and some of his most interesting characters  trying to deal with it.  There are also some scenes of real poignance and heart that will make you think, and make you feel. <br /> If you haven't read Discworld, read Guards, Guards!, and then this novel.  You'll be glad you did!	1997-10-29
