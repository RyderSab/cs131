You have to highlight years' worth of accomplishments at different jobs and possibly even different fields in a page or two.  Attorney resumes can be particularly complex, as many of us worked for some time at a first career before coming to the law, and need some way to handle that time of our lives in a legal resume.  Further, many attorneys have both in-house and firm experience, and will want to tailor the content of their resumes accordingly.  In addition, the type of resume a corporation might want to see may be a lot different from what a law firm expects to see.<br /><br />Given the complexity of the topic, one would expect a book entitled \\"Best Resumes for Attorneys\\" to provide some insight into these issues.  Instead, the book fails utterly, providing instead a \\"Best Resume for Attorneys.\\"  All experiences are mashed into a bland one-page format that strips out virtually anything that might distinguish you from anyone else.  The authors waste precious page space hectoring the reader about how certain example resumes are bad because of formatting errors, as if this were a secretarial handbook rather than a book for professionals.  Every example of a so-called \\"best resume\\" is virtually identical to every other example provided.<br /><br />If you read this, your brain will actually expel knowledge it already has about good writing and job search tactics.  Avoid entirely.  This isn't even worth checking out from the library, because even touching the cover of this book might taint your ability to write like a human being and put together any kind of resume that might actually get you a job.	2005-09-16

There are no UFOs, antigravity projects or Terminators here.  What \\"Code Names\\" provides is a comprehensive list, by country, of the legal framework of the military/intelligence relationship between that country and the US, as well as the definitions of a lot of code names, 70% of which appear to be already-public names of war games of the past 30 years.<br /><br />So what, you may ask?  On its own, this is pretty dry stuff.  As other reviewers have noted, this is more of a reference book than something you pick up and read like a novel.  However, what \\"Code Names\\" does is put some meat on the bones of Chalmers Johnson's concept of the \\"empire of bases\\" from his book \\"The Sorrows of Empire.\\"  The agreements, the exercises, the cooperative activities - the mechanisms of imperial control are laid right out in \\"Code Names,\\" as dry as they are.<br /><br />You might wish to check this out from the library before you buy it, just to make sure it's something you would be interested in or could even use.	2005-09-12

I suppose the library or bookstore always had something else I wanted to read more.  However, on my latest trip to the library, I finally checked out this novel as my introduction to Banks' work and to the Culture novels.  I wish I had left it on the shelf.<br /><br />The plot, such as it is, is thin and often nonexistent.  Our \\"hero\\" Horza has things happen to him as he drifts about for the first 2/3rd of the book.  These things are uniformly nasty and unpleasant, as the novel wallows in a variety of ugliness.  After wandering the galaxy aimlessly, suddenly the book realizes about 100 pages from the end that it needs to get somewhere, and then a whole bunch of plot and exposition gets tossed at the reader.  At least we finally get some direction.  Then, in the last couple of sentences of the book, we get a final insult from the author; I won't spoil it for you, but if you're like me you'll slam the book shut and smack it against your head repeatedly.  Then, like \\"Animal House,\\" we get a \\"where are they now\\" section at the end that explains what happened to our characters later, and at the end of that, we get another, really final insult from the author, after which you'll smack your head some more.<br /><br />This novel is sometimes characterized as \\"morally ambiguous.\\"  If that means that the characters act in reprehensible and amoral ways, then, sure, I agree.  There really isn't a likable character put before us.<br /><br />Avoid.  Or if you must read this, check it out from the library first.	2005-09-06

It's true - Cook has the documents to prove it.  The pioneers of aerospace, while cocky, were not ones to make statements like that if they weren't true.  And they were all in agreement.  So where are our flying cars, 50 years later?<br /><br />Nick Cook, a writer for the respected Jane's Defense Weekly, set out to get some answers.  Along the way, he encounters some of the usual suspects in the antigravity story, such as Townsend Brown, and even some characters familiar to those with some knowledge of UFOlogy.  I'm sure many readers won't appreciate that he dismantles a number of legends that have grown up around those folks.  For example, Cook puts forth convincing evidence that while Townsend Brown may have discovered something important, he was not part of the overall classified effort to achieve antigravity.  The story takes Cook to Nazi Germany and to the elusive Hans Kammler, as well as the Bell.<br /><br />This is a fascinating book that will appeal to anyone with an interest in antigravity or unconventional science.  It's definitely worth a buy.	2005-06-02

A novel that spanned thousands of years in the lives of its immortal characters was brash and new.<br /><br />\\"Sister Alice\\" continues that epic scale in a different milieu, focusing on the lives of a handful of immortal members of the Families, guardians of the peace and stability of the galaxy.  When Alice's attempt to create a new universe goes horribly wrong, an epic chain of events is set into motion, as the Families attempt to protect the galaxy and punish those responsible.  Alice returns to Earth to take responsibility, and bonds with her sibling Ord, who tries to help set things right.  Reed does not disappoint in scope and imaginativeness, creating a rich environment for this story.<br /><br />I knocked off one star primarily because the character of Ord is essentially a cipher, despite the amount of time the novel focuses on him.  Somewhat like Oliver Twist, we never really get to know him, despite his centrality to the story.  Ultimately, we get to know his pursuers Xo and Ravleen better than him.  This is wrapped up with the mystery of what Ord is doing and why; for most of the book, even he isn't entirely sure.  I would have liked a little more substance to our main character.<br /><br />Although the cover is atrocious and has nothing at all to do with the contents of the novel, I cannot deduct any stars for its unfortunate art and graphic design; authors never have any control over such things.<br /><br />Fans of \\"Marrow\\" and of epic space operas will definitely enjoy this.	2005-04-13

The setup of the alien infestation of Earth is quite skilled, and is written in great depth in a realistic manner.  Gerrold's future Earth, decimated by plague and beseiged by alien ecology, is believable and interesting; in other hands, it could easily come across as silly or boring.  Although our protagonist McCarthy is flawed, so what?  The perfect hero gets boring after a while.  Having said that, his whining and drama get a little tedious after a while.<br /><br />The reason this is a tough review to write is the steady decline in quality of the next three books in the series.  As is common in (endemic to?) SF novel series, each successive novel tends to become more turgid, slow and self-indulgent.  The War Against the Chtorr is no exception.  In fact, the remaining novels in this series (particularly Book 3) set new standards in tedium.<br /><br />Were this novel standing on its own, I wouldn't hesitate to give it 4 stars.  However, after you read it, you'll want to read the others, and you will likely be disappointed.  I have to knock off one star for the annoyance you will endure if you do so.  Be forewarned!	2005-03-10

The War Against the Chtorr series is no exception.<br /><br />A Matter for Men sets up the series very well.  The hero is flawed, but that's OK from a literary standpoint.  The milieu Gerrold created is quite rich, and the mystery of the worms (are they intelligent?  how did they get here?) is compelling.  However, by the time we get to book 3 here, half the novel is wasted sitting in a room getting some whacked-out est training with the hero.  Indeed, the supposed \\"mode\\" training is just recycled est psychobabble; just look up est on line (you can even use Amazon's A9 engine) and you'll see what I mean, right down to the chair arranging (lovingly detailed in the novel) and the weird assistants.  The mode training is simply sophistry and power-playing forced down our throats as some kind of philophical breakthrough.  Not only did I not buy it, it bored me to tears.<br /><br />And let's not overlook the clumsy and inexplicable relationship between Jim and Lizard.  There is no basis whatsover for the attraction or relationship, as far as I can tell, and it's written like a high school student imagining what two people in love actually say to each other.<br /><br />In between fumbling around with his girlfriend and getting brainwashed, Jim hangs out with some renegades (more brainwashing and psychobabble).  After an interminable amount of time, the book peters out, thankfully.  This novel not only fails to provide any answers to any of the \\"big mysteries\\" set out earlier in the series, it just piles on more of them.  And by Book 3, we ought to be getting somewhere.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is the worst of the four novels; A Season for Slaughter actually picks up the pace somewhat and provides some kind of advancement to the story, even if it's still peppered with huge doses of modie \\"philosophy.\\"<br /><br />Avoid.  Although if you've already read books 1 and 2, you'll end up reading this one out of curiosity no matter what the reviews say.l end up reading this one out of curiosity no matter what the reviews say.	2005-03-10

I usually enjoy their books, and both have built up large and high-quality bodies of work.  That's why the badness of \\"Flying Sorcerers\\" is so baffling.  It's like they banged this out in a weekend on a bet.<br /><br />Much is made of the alleged humor of this novel.  Fannish jokes and puns belong at Worldcon, not in a book put out for sale to the general public.  Their humor value fails to rise over the level of Granpa's thighslappers.  For example, two young alien boys who build a flying machine are called \\"Wilville\\" and \\"Orbur.\\"  Ho, ho.  My sides!  And the gags go downhill from there.<br /><br />So why 2 stars instead of one?  Despite all of its flaws, this is still an amiable book.  \\"Ringworld Throne\\" aside, both Niven and Gerrold have enough talent to make this book at least somewhat interesting, and to keep the thin plot moving.<br /><br />If you're interested in these authors, and you should be, pick out almost anything from their extensive catalogs before you purchase this.	2005-02-16
US	51956494	R1T1X1HCJKUASM	0345457854	454548172	Coalescent	Books	1	7	9	N	N	Not recommended	I bought this novel at the airport bookstore, which never has a great selection.  Having heard of Baxter, and faced with a choice between this, some Dan Brown dreck, and some generic fiction, I chose \\"Coalescent.\\"  I wish I had simply stared at the back of the seat in front of me, like Puddy from Seinfeld, for the entire flight instead.<br /><br />Early in the novel, we meet the main characters: George, a nebbishy middle-aged white man, and Peter, a nerdy middle-aged white man whose character is defined in part by his Internet proficiency.  One might say that Baxter knows his audience.  More cynically, one might place this book solidly in the \\"wish-fullfilment\\" subgenre of SF (what Gerrold would call \\"Mary Sue\\" stories), where the protagonist is the outsider innocent (like the reader) who is gradually introduced to some greater truth and some adventure at the same time.<br /><br />The first two-thirds of this book are serviceable, if tedious and somewhat boring.  They are unfocused, and in the best tradition of lazy historical fiction, get by with name dropping.  King Arthur and Mussolini?  Please.  At least he gets points for creativity in name dropping.  In the last hundred pages, though, \\"Coalescent\\" picked up the pace, and started to capture some of my waning interest.  The \\"human hive\\" idea set forth on the back cover finally starts to come into play toward the end.  But then the novel encounters a serious problem: Peter.<br /><br />The character of Peter is problematic in many regards, particularly with regard to the Internet.  The novel fosters the idea that some nuts in a chatroom can actually solve the mysteries of the universe, when the reality of chat is that it's merely a place for adolescent boys to argue with each other and for retirees to talk about contrails.  Peter, with little actual expertise, a laptop, and participation in some conspiracy chatroom, figures out the nature of some vague threat to humanity.  OK, although implausible, this is simply wish-fulfillment stuff for a subset of his readership that actually might believe that science, or societal change, or anything else useful might result simply from chatting with your fellow conspiracy buffs.  Yet, Peter proceeds to take quite serious action based on silly chatroom speculation, action with dire consequences - and the novel approves!  Peter's actions are much more insane than heroic, and yet the book treats him as if he was justified in his actions.  Great.  This drops my rating down to 1 star from 2 stars, as it comes awfully close to encouraging a subset of his readership to do things in real life they and others might regret.<br /><br />I have not read any of Baxter's other books.

We knew we were in for trouble when the book told us not once but twice in the first few pages of the \\"renowned curator\\" of the Louvre, as if we didn't get it the first time.  Rather than prose and plot that should be renowned, this novel serves up cliche after cliche in a grating, clunky style, as well as broadly-drawn caricatures like \\"The Bull\\" rather than actual characters.  Even the religious claptrap that has brought this book the opposite of renown in some people's eyes is rehashed mumbo-jumbo.  While a book of this quality would bring renown to an eighth-grader who managed to put it together, it is simply embarrassing that an adult would write something like this, and even more embarrassing that other adults would buy it.  Boring, tedious, and stupid, this book should be renowned for its badness.  If ever there were a print version of Mystery Science Theater for books, surely the Da Vinci Code would be the first one subjected to the MST3K treatment, which would finally be something of renown associated with this book.	2004-08-11

Wright weaves philosophy, action, and character skillfully into a wildly creative novel that is very hard to put down.  It's refreshing to read a good optimistic space opera that isn't all about galactic-scale battle strategy and tactics.<br />Most &quot;books of ideas&quot; at some point become talky at best, or preachy and didactic at worst.  Wright avoids these pitfalls and integrates the ideas pretty seamlessly into the story.  For those familiar with objectivist philosophy, you will be on familiar ground.  In some respects, the hero Phaethon, more so in than in the previous few books, is reminiscent of the architect from &quot;The Fountainhead.&quot;  Both have similar values, and both have constructed a magnificent structure to express those values.  However, this novel is far from a clone of &quot;The Fountainhead,&quot; and any baggage the reader may have with regard to Rand's novels should not affect his or her opinion of this book.<br />The glossary at the end does clear up some of the terminology and naming conventions used in the three books of this Golden Oecumene trilogy.  However, I recommend waiting to read it until you're done, unless you are completely baffled, because there are potential spoilers in there.<br />A great read--don't hesitate to read all of the books in this trilogy.

It is tremendously entertaining, at once a grand space opera, a detective story, and a much-less-grimy-than-genre cyberpunk narrative, with enough philosophy and depth to keep things interesting without getting bombastic or tedious.  If you like any one of these things, you should consider this novel.<br />There is a lot of detail and far-future terminology (the names alone are fascinating) thrown at us from the very beginning.  However, Wright wisely doesn't spend a lot of time trying to tell us how all of the technology works, or explaining all the details of the richly-imagined Golden Oecumene.  We figure it out through context and the actions of the characters, which helps keep the story moving without getting bogged down.  The Golden Oecumene is also refreshing in the SF genre, as an imagining of the far future that is neither dystopian nor utopian-but-hiding-a-dark-secret.  At its core, this is an optimistic novel, and optimism is often sorely lacking in SF.<br />If there is any obvious flaw in this book, it is that the ending seems somewhat abrupt; I suspect that this books was the first half of a larger volume that was arbitrarily chopped in half by the publisher.  Hence, the \\"Volume 2\\" designation on the sequel, \\"The Phoenix Exultant.\\"  Buy both books and read \\"The Phoenix Exultant\\" immediately afterward; you will be glad you did.	2004-04-06

That's no small feat; I'd rather stare at the back of the seat in front of me than finish some of the books I've brough on airplane trips.<br />If you like cyberpunk, you will probably like this.  To the extent that it has problems, it perhaps follows the conventions of the genre a bit too closely.  Further, there are one or two too many characters, and the crime investigated by the main character is a bit too convoluted.  In fairness, I don't care for mysteries, which typically involve the same kind of over-thought and complicated crimes and investigations; if you like mystery novels and SF, you would likely give this five stars and enjoy it quite a bit.	2004-04-06

It surveys the major beer styles, and discusses the best food pairings for each, teaching skills that help the reader decide what beer to pair with which food.<br />Wisely, Oliver omits the technical descriptions of beer styles and focuses on what they taste like.  For homebrewers and beer geeks (hey, I'm one myself), discussions of IBUs and original gravities are great, but they can turn off people who are just interested in drinking good beer and in expanding their beer horizons.  And this book is as much about spreading the good word about craft beer as it is about appealing to those who already love it.  However, there is enough information about history and brewing to appeal to the most advanced brewer.  Indeed, Oliver does a good job at keeping it breezy and accessible without being pedantic or &quot;dumbing down&quot; the material.<br />The appendix at the end provides a list of suggested beer and food pairings.  It is useful and provides a quick reference that you can consult before heading out to the store.<br />If you have any interest in craft beer and good food, you will enjoy this book.	2004-03-03

This classic book has recently emerged from the land of the out-of-print books in a new edition, and I bought one as soon as I found out it was available.  As an experienced homebrewer, I found it fascinating and informative.  Noonan gets down to the hardcore chemical and technical foundations of brewing.  And if you are interested in decoction mashing, Noonan provides what is probably the best description of the process that is available in print.  This book is perfect for the professional brewer or advanced all-grain homebrewer.<br />However, the sheer volume of detail would bore a newcomer to brewing, or worse yet, scare him or her off.

Walking into the homebrew store or visiting its website, and seeing all the ingredients and equipment, can be intimidating for the newcomer.  Turning to the web, magazines and books for enlightenment, the first-timer can be intimidated by the sheer volume of brewing information floating around.  Rather than throwing your hands up in confusion and walking away, buy this book.<br />Papazian's motto is &quot;Relax, don't worry--have a homebrew!&quot;  Rather than getting bogged down in the details of making perfect, contest-winning beers, Papazian focuses on the basic steps a homebrewer has to follow to make good beer.  You can make something tasty and enjoyable with minimal equipment, malt extract and part of a weekend afternoon, and Papazian holds the brewer's hand through the entire process.  Once you've nailed the basics--and it's not hard--the last part of the book teaches you how to advance to intermediate brewing without much additional hassle.<br />Experienced brewers may find this book too basic for their needs.

This book puts together a great deal of information about the Orion program, its goals, and chances for success.  Most of this information had previously been unavailable, or scattered, or bandied about on bizarre X-Files-ish web sites.  But this is the real deal, the definitive history of the program that was once shrouded in mystery and aerospace legend.<br />While a bit clunky and awkward in places, \\"Project Orion\\" held my attention, and generally maintained a cohesive narrative. There are quite a few drawings and photos in this book, which really help to the sense of adventure and excitement of Orion.<br />Several reviewers mention that many of the details remain classified.  That's certainly true.  But having said that, I am amazed at the things we learn in this book that actually were declassified (e.g., the survivability of materials in close proximity to a nuclear explosion).  I have a degree in engineering, and this book got technical enough to satisfy my technical curiosity, but not so technical as to bore me.<br /><br />I started reading this book thinking that I would chuckle at the naivete of scientists who thought they could blow up a few nukes to drive a spacecraft.

With copious footnotes, Mahl shows how Britain manipulated public opinion, lied to the American people, and subverted the democratic process.  Mahl also demonstrates how Britain could not have pulled this off without the complicity of American Anglophile elites with stronger devotion to a foreign power than to their own country.<br />While the information is interesting and well-supported, I found the writing style of this book to be tedious.  Despite the fascinating material, this book is not written in a way that grabs your attention for a sustained read.  Still, it's history, not a novel, so at least some of this is to be expected.  If you have any interest in the intelligence field, and particularly the effect of covert operations on politics, policy and civil society, I recommend this book.	2002-08-06

This was a really funny book that also gave me quite an education in investment banking and the world of finance.  &quot;Liar's Poker&quot; is very well-written, and keeps things moving.  While the subject matter may be complicated, Lewis keeps it comprehensible to those of us who don't have an MBA.  It's fascinating to see how the big players work the markets - and in some cases, manipulate them outright.  Indeed, &quot;Liar's Poker&quot; gives us a front-row seat to the creation of the mortgage-backed debt obligations that are commonly traded today, and that allowed the current real estate bubble to inflate as large as it has.<br />Lewis' analysis of Salomon and its problems applies in many respects to professional service firms in general.  Having worked in a law firm during the recent boom years, I can say that rapid growth and an abundance of cash can lead to hubris, disorganization, and a loss of core values.  Lawyers, accountants, and anyone else who works at a professional service firm will particularly enjoy this book.	2002-07-25
US	51956494	ROR0W40WDT7TY	0553290029	881440442	This Perfect Day	Books	5	4	4	N	N	An overlooked classic	This novel has been sadly overlooked and out-of-print for years.  That's a real shame, because this is among Levin's best, if not his outright best.  Levin paints a vivid picture of the logical end of the therapeutic state, a bland dystopia in which conformity is pharmaceutically enforced.  In a sense, this novel is a precursor to \\"The Matrix,\\" a memorable and cranky uncle to it, if you will.  This is great science fiction, from an author who doesn't usually work in that genre and is therefore not too bound by its conventions.  This novel is back in print now, so buy it fast while it's available!	2002-03-12

Hard SF fans will love the technological details and throwaways, and the meticulous care devoted to the accuracy of the nanotechnological future.  Lovers of good books will love the great dialogue, the thoughtful plot, the characterizations, and the vividness with which they are all realized.  It's hard to go wrong with anything written by Stephenson.<br />This book also rewards multiple readings.  I loved the book the first time around, but didn't much care for the last couple of pages; they seemed like a letdown to me. However, I \\"got it\\" the second time I read the book. Buy it, read it, repeat. You will be glad you did.	2001-05-18

Yes, I suppose, because this book does contain a  mishmash of poorly-conceived and ill-developed ideas.  The most startling  one to me was that genocide is A-OK, as long as it's done by the right  people to further socialism.  If I hadn't already been put off this book by  the complete lack of character development and the flimsy &quot;plot&quot;,  I would have been when the author hauled out that gem.  To the extent there  was a plot, it followed the time-tested formula of &quot;it's time for X to  happen so it will,&quot; regardless of the characters.  I wish I had used  the time I spent with this book to do something more enjoyable, like clean  up those oil spots on my garage floor.	2000-08-24

Iread 3-5 novels (mystery &amp; classical) per week and O'Connell'snovel left me breathless.  I truly enjoyed the pace of the story and pushed forward eagerly to the conclusion.  Although I eagerly read toward the conclusion, I was bereft that the story couldn't continue beyond the final page.<br />The characters intrigued me, as do Mallory and Charles in O'Connell's other books.	1999-08-06
