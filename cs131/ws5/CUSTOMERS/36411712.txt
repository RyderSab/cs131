I love anyone who has the guts to stand up to foolhardy right-wingers.  And Michael Moore is such a man.

(Bob Weir almost kicked out of the group?!)  You probably won't like this if you're not a fan, but if you are, by all means get it.  A compelling look at a band which many people still consider an enigma. <BR>Also recommended: &quot;No One's Even Bleeding&quot; &amp; &quot;Delano&quot;	2003-01-12

Sissy's a strong willed gal whose adventures will leave you laughing AND thinking.  Probably not for everyone, but definitely for those who enjoy stories a little out of the mainstream.<BR>And for those who do, you may also like \\"No One's Even Bleeding\\" & \\"Delano\\".	2003-01-09
US	36411712	RN7ZPET4Q4TS3	0743400569	298138533	Fake Liar Cheat	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Good read	Claire & Lonnie are exactly what the title implies... fakes, liars  & cheats.  While working at a dead-end temp. agency job, Lonnie meets Claire.  She introduces him into a world (Hollwood) that takes him on quite a wild ride.  Intriguing, funny and easy to read.  You'll enjoy this one.  <BR>Another good book about a dead-end job and Hollywood is \\"No One's Even Bleeding\\".	2003-01-09
US	36411712	R2YJVPS4FFC5QY	0743418174	780559593	Good in Bed	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Terrific!	Father abandons family, mother turns gay, publicly betrayed by boyfriend in writing.  But somehow, Cannie comes through it with courage & humor.  Funny, bittersweet & well worth it!<BR>Also recommended: No One's Even Bleeding	2003-01-07
US	36411712	R3NKSEH9EZDSBJ	1586481444	239325354	Common Nonsense	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Oh, that Andy	Funny book with 'on target' observations (especially the Catholic Church on sex).  Rooney's comments regarding the absurdities in society make us laugh AND think.  He's not afraid to lambast anyone & that's a MUST in a humorist.  <BR>If you like absurdities in institutions exposed, you may also like \\"No One's Even Bleeding\\" & \\"Delano\\".	2003-01-07

I especially love it when he goofs on the Kennedy family, celebrities (Michael Jackson riff is great), and his own radio crew.  No one is safe from his tirades.  If you're a fan (and really, who isn't?), get this!<BR>Also recommended, a funny little gem I found on amazon entitled \\"No One's Even Bleeding\\".	2003-01-07

These short stories &amp; essays are hysterical!  &quot;Santaland Diaries&quot; is especially funny.  So is &quot;Based On A True Story&quot;.  (Dark, but funny.)  <BR>Other sarcastic social commentary you may also enjoy: &quot;No One's Even Bleeding&quot; &amp; &quot;Delano&quot;.	2003-01-06

If you're an Italian-American (like me), definitely get this.  You'll see a lot of yourself, your family &amp; friends in these pages.  If you're NOT Italian-American, buy it anyway... OR ELSE!  No seriously, great stuff... especially the chapter entitled &quot;How The Boys Say It&quot;.<BR>For another funny book about an Italian-American, read &quot;No One's Even Bleeding&quot;.	2003-01-04

Amazing to believe he got away with what he did (airline pilot, doctor, lawyer etc.) at a time in life when most kids are still trying to figure out what to major in.  Even more amazing is how he turned everything around as an adult.  Fast, enjoyable read.  <BR>If you like this kind of likeable, conniving character, you may also like &quot;No One's Even Bleeding&quot; &amp; &quot;Delano&quot;.	2003-01-01

Anytime you get a chance to take a look into a world you're unfamiliar with, you're bound to be shocked at what an 'expert' (someone in the trenches) has to say.  Such is the case here.  Obviously embellished, but we get the point.  <BR>Other funny books from 'experts' in the trenches: &quot;No One's Even Bleeding&quot; and &quot;Delano&quot;.	2002-12-22

But David Gannon put it best, \\"It turns out that Grisham has finally diverged from his mass-manufactured overly frenetic pulp thriller habit and actually written a very different sort of story.\\"<br />If you like farcical characters & funny stories, buy this.

Books	5	2	6	N	N	The real deal	Irreverent, antagonistic, politically incorrect... Michael Moore is all of these.  And, oh yeah, FUNNY!  His pokes at the Bush White House are hysterical.  And not because I'm a liberal (I'm not, no political affiliation), he simply shows the absurdities in the beliefs and actions of \\"those rich, old white guys\\".  I almost hate to think what would have happened if Gore had won; we never would have had this book to make us laugh.  <BR>Looking for other books to make you laugh?  Try \\"No One's Even Bleeding\\" or \\"Delano\\".  They're definitely \\"lighter\\", but also very funny.	2002-12-20

You know what I like about Bill Maher?  He's never afraid to say what's on his mind.  Racial profiling a good thing?  According to Bill, in some cases it is.  He also rants about crummy airport security, wasting money on 'the war on drugs', & how 9/11 was politically motivated, not religiously motivated.  (Bin Laden doesn't really care about Islam?)  <BR>Well worth it if you're a fan.  If not, don't bother.  You either 'get him' or you don't.  And if you like politically incorrect views, you may also like these other books, \\"No One's Even Bleeding\\" & \\"Delano\\".	2002-12-17

It accurately portrays what it's like being an Italian guy from New York. And let me tell you from experience, it's exactly as fun & funny as Schirripa describes. Another good book about an Italian guy from New York is \\"No One's Even Bleeding\\". (Also highly recommended.)	2002-12-10

His pokes at political correctness are worth the price alone.  (If you like jabs at political correctness, you may also like &quot;No One's Even Bleeding&quot; &amp; &quot;Delano&quot;.)

If Cobain's music brought joy to you, as it did to so many, this (especially) won't be for you.  The purpose of books, as I see it, is to entertain.  There's really nothing entertaining here, just sadness.  If you want to be entertained, read &quot;No One's Even Bleeding&quot; or &quot;Delano&quot;.  At least you'll get a laugh.	2002-11-20

My favorite part was &quot;who does what voice&quot;.  Dan Castellaneta is truly a versatile guy. (Is he related to Lenny Castellaneta, author of &quot;No One's Even Bleeding&quot;?)

Miller's cultural observations are hysterical!  Nobody's safe from his barbs, nothing's off limits.  His diatribes on public education &amp; Hollywood are especially funny.  (For more derisive commentary on schools &amp; Tinsel Town, though, read &quot;No One's Even Bleeding&quot;).  The thing I like best about Dennis is his willingness to goof on himself as well as others.  The &quot;Rant Zone&quot; is full of honest &amp; biting wit, two essential ingredients for laughter.	2002-10-18

US	36411712	ROVPL236ZPOLR	0966481615	687607016	Delano	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Sarcastic yet poignant	Delano is sarcastic, funny, and sadly, right on the nose. Orozco's Heller-esque commentary on the absurdities that permeate schools everywhere is testament to a system that becomes alarmingly more inept each year. His tongue in cheek depiction of educators more concerned with political correctness and rampant cronyism than the business of learning is absolutely on target! <BR>And for even more laughs on our crippled school system, I suggest Lenny Castellaneta's \\"No One's Even Bleeding\\".	2002-10-04
