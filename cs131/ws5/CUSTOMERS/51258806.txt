Chellis Glendinning argues that imperialism has been the dominant and dominating political force in human civilization from the age of the great European empires down to our own era of national and international  corporate takeovers. The influence and effect of imperialism is felt in  every area of our lives, from the global to the deeply personal. In Off The  Map, Glendinning charts the course of empire across countries and  continents, and on into individual minds, hearts, and bodies -- all within  the context of her horseback ride through the wilds of New Mexico with her  friend Snowflake Martinez, an Indo-Hispanic vaquero. As their dreamlike  journey unfolds, Chellis and Snowflake strive to understand the results of  their ancestors' fatal encounter: hers, the &quot;people of empire&quot;;  his, &quot;the colonized&quot; -- weaving together current events with  their childhood memories and the forces of history to reveal the extent of  imperialism's legacy -- and to find a way &quot;off the map&quot;, to a  more hopeful future for human kind.

Basque sheepherders and others found ethnic communion and  support in Basque boarding houses and hotels that were usually run by  women.  These Basque men who stayed in America often brought over their  families, or married women from the old country who then migrated.  Many  Basque women migrated on their own.  As new generations of native Basque  Americans were born, women often became the principle carriers and  preservers of cultural traditions, as well as primary agents of  Americanization, as they sought and encouraged their children to seek the  educational and material benefits of the United States.  Jacqueline Thursby  interviewed Basque American women across the West, observed and  participated in cultural activities and events, and did supplemental  research in the Basque country of Spain and France in preparation for this  seminal overview of the culture of Basque American woemn.  Thursby  admirably clarifies the role of women in the transformation of Basques into  Basque Americans.  _Mother's Table, Father's Chair_ will be of immense  interest to students of ethnography, basque culture, women's studies, and  Western American studies.	1999-09-28

For most of the six days and nights of fighting, the Americans were cut off from supply lines, fighting for  survival without adequate food, water, medical supplies or ammunition. The  massive artillery defense(much of which was launched by forward observer  Robert Weiss) has been credited with making the difference in this pivotal  battle of the Normandy invasion. With only one radio, powered by dying  batteries, Weiss and his team brought down a rain of brutal iron that time  after time turned back the German offensive. Event after event unfolds to  envelop the reader in the high drama of warfare. Moments of courage and  despair, heroism and terror, are interspersed with thoughtful contemplation  and historical perspective rarely matched in the military annals of the  Normandy invasion.
