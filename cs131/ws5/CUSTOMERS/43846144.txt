Pauline and Michael meet when she and some of her friends enter the Anton grocery store, after she cut her forehead jumping off a tram, and Michael, taken by Pauline in her red coat, tends to her injury. <br /> <br />When Michael returns from the war, he proposes to her, and thus begins the adventure of two very different people trying to make the best of life. Pauline is a highly social, scattered and energetic person who loves to experiment. Her husband, on the other hand, likes things simple and just the way they are. Why change something that isn't broken? These differences will bring on questions from both of them over the years, wondering why they put up with each other, and would they be happier if they hadn't married, or even met? <br /> <br />Tyler gives us a snapshot of these two individuals throughout their lives. The reader is introduced to their children, one of which will bring them much grief. We also meet some neighbors and clients of the grocery store, as well as some of Pauline's girlfriends, who get together regularly to have lunch and play cards. <br /> <br />In this novel, Tyler looks at issues relating to what makes a happy marriage. Her main characters were quite young when they married, and didn't really know each other before they tied the knot. Can such a relationship work? She describes the husband's unhappiness as he explores his feelings, as well as Pauline who deals with the same issues by choosing to ignore them, for the most part. <br /> <br />You will enjoy growing with these characters, as they grow-up during the course of this novel. There are some story lines that are left hanging, however, such as the relationship between Pauline and Alex, that leave you wondering if you might have skipped over a chapter along the way, but overall the story is well told, and worth reading. <br />	2005-09-29

Very late on one rainy night, Chaz asks his rather drunk wife to join him on the ship's deck. He pretends to drop something, bends over to pick it up, but instead he picks up his wife by the ankles and tosses her overboard. Joey survives the fall thanks to her training as a swimmer, and manages to stay alive in the water, where Mick Stranahan, a former cop now living on a deserted island, eventually finds her hanging on for dear life to a bale of marijuana. Instead of reporting her husband's actions to the police, she decides to get even, with the help of Mick and her brother. <br /> <br />Chaz plays the grieving widower, but the detective in charge of the case isn't buying it. As the story unfolds, the author introduces a full cast of characters, each with their own quirks, from the detective's pet pythons to Chaz's bodyguard Tool, a large, hairy brute that must follow Chaz around, as ordered by his crooked employer. <br /> <br />Many smiles, laughs and a lot of fun await the reader.	2005-09-04

This time, she sends Tempe Brennan to Guatemala on an anthropological dig to find victims of a massacre in Chupan Ya. <br /> <br />While there, two of her colleagues are attacked, and Tempe is asked to assist in the identification of remains that might pertain to another case involving the dissapearance of four young women, one of them being the Canadian ambassador's daughter. <br /> <br />Reichs is brilliant at what she does, and story telling is among those talents. The perfect pace of the narrative, combined with interesting characters and fascinating forensic science make this a very rewarding reading experience. I wouldn't say that this is her best work, either. To me, Deja dead is still her best novel, perhaps because it was her first, perhaps because it was the first of this genre that I read. But I do love the fact that in each successive novel, she introduces something new and fresh. Well, considering the subject matter, maybe not so fresh...! <br /> <br />You won't want to put it down.	2005-07-31

A lot of shopping, of course, strains in her relationships, quirky parents, more shopping, increased debt, etc. <br /> <br />In this book, intitled Shopaholic & Sister, the story opens with Becky and Luke ending their ten month honeymoon around the world and returning to London, where Becky finds that the people around her have gone on to find new friends and even a new family member! Since her faithful readership had never heard of a sister before, they will quickly have figured out that it can only mean that Becky's father learns of a child he never knew existed. <br /> <br />Becky tries to cope with her return to the real world and to Luke going back to working long hours. So she keeps herself busy finding homes for the mountain of souvenirs she purchased on the honeymoon. And so she discovers eBay! As well, she is determined to get to know her new-found sister and that they should be soul mates, but they are complete opposites of each other.  <br /> <br />This story is filled with the usual antics that are to be expected by the warm character that is Rebecca Brandon (ne Bloomwood). All the ingredients are there, as well as an opening at the end to lead the way for another novel in this series. In my opinion, this book proved to be more interesting than Shopaholic ties the knot. It is a quick paced, entertaining story about a woman you will not so soon forget... especially on your next shopping spree. <br /> <br />Enjoy! <br />	2005-02-12

While working at the bank one day, she meets Sexton Beecher, a salesman. After their wedding, they move into a rented house on the beach in Fortune's Rock, near a mill town, and later find a way to purchase it. She collects sea glass during her walks on the beach. The more time she spends with her new husband, however, and the less she realises she knows about him. When the economy takes a dive in 1929, Sexton loses his job and, depressed, is forced to start working at the mill. He also loses his self-esteem. <br /> <br />Here, Anita Shreve takes her readers into a world of lost fortunes, unions, survival, friendship, violence but also betrayal and, most of all, issues of trust. This novel serves up a full cast of characters you will not so easily forget, in a well-written package. <br /> <br />This is a memorable book by an extremely talented writer. <br />	2005-01-30

Orr will spend time with M.

This book begins where the other one left off with our happy couple, Becky and Luke. Although her parents and neighbors don't believe she is actually dating a millionaire, they will end up exploring new job opportunities in a shopaholic's paradise: Manhattan. As Luke works long hours to open an office in New York, Becky, between interviews, discovers sample sales and a host of great deals to be had in the USA. After all, it's not as if she is spending real money, according to her usual flawed logic. <br /> <br />As the shopping bags hidden from Luke accumulate in the closet of their hotel room, to the letters from creditors pilling up once again, Becky's and Luke's lives spiral out of control after the release of a damaging article. But wait: things always work out for Becky in the end, but they won't necessarily end up where you would expect them to go. <br /> <br />Although not my preferred style of literature, this chick-lit success story is simple, fun and quite enjoyable from beginning to end. I'm looking forward to reading the next installment in the Bloomwood saga. <br />	2004-11-13

She writes for a financial publication, but dreams of writing for a fashion magazine instead. However, if she can't get a job writing about it, then she might as well go shopping!<br />Very quickly, the reader will understand the extent of her \\"illness\\". Short on cash, bank managers and credit card companies send her multiple letters encouraging her to contact them in order to discuss her credit situation. Rebecca, refusing to surrender, tries out some advise she received: Spend less or make more money. As she tries to curb her spending, she runs into some trouble and realises that this might not be the best approach for her. She then attempts to make more money. This leads to some more interesting situations. As she seeks refuge from her creditors at her parent's house, her life will take an interesting turn (for the better, let's hope).<br />This book makes for a fast, light summer read. Hopefully, you won't recognize yourselves too much in this character, but you will feel attached to her throughout the story.	2004-05-15

The police contact him regarding the murder of Jacques Sauni&egrave;re, curator of the Louvre, who, before dying, leaves a series of clues hidden in Da Vinci's works for Langdon and Sophie Neveu, a French cryptologist, to find.<br />Together they piece the clues to reveal the secret left behind by Sauni&egrave;re. However, seeing Langdon's name written out at the scene of the crime by the victim himself makes him the prime suspect in the murder investigation.<br />The novel is well written in general and filled with fascinating information about Da Vinci and the Priory of Sion. Whether these details are accurate or not, I wouldn't know, but they make for such a fascinating backdrop to the story that I didn't care. I wanted to believe it was true. But this might keep purists or serious art buffs from getting into the art world described by the author. Dan Brown has written a very entertaining novel and, after having read it, I understand why it has been on the Top 10 list for over 40 weeks. Some of the story lines are quite predictable and you will see the inevitable pages before the author gets to it, but luckily none of these elements are part of the main storyline.<br />I can't recommend this book enough.	2004-03-13

On one New Year's Eve, Tom happens on the perfect location. And so begins their first year as entrepreneurs.<br />Binchy, renown for her character development, presents her readers with a full serving of interesting people, some new and some you will remember from previous novels. What I do find about her books, however, is that they are all very similar. The cast is interesting and you do get attached to them, the pace is good, but they read like a good soap opera that has very low-level drama. I for one would like to see Binchy try something different. <br />If you are a devoted Binchy fan, or are looking for a nice, well-written story, then pick up this book, curl up in your favourite chair with a cup of tea, and enjoy. If you are ambivalent about her previous works, then you should pass on this one, as it is a continuation of her last novels.	2004-03-13

She was raised by T.

Having found a picture of a black Madonna with the inscription &quot;Tiburon South Carolina&quot; among her mother's belongings, she decides to run away from home with Rosaleen, hoping to find somebody in Tiburon that can tell her about her mother. Once there, they are welcomed by the Boatright sisters, August, May and June. August teaches Lily and Rosaleen about beekeeping.<br />In this pink house, Lily meets the Daughters of Mary, an assorted lot of strong women who worship together in the Boatright home, and also Zach, a young black boy who dreams of becoming a lawyer.<br />Lily also learns about what a mother actually is, and what a mother ought to be.<br />There are a few scenes of racial tension in this novel, and some readers have expressed some dislike of the book because of it. For me, this element only serves as a backdrop to set the story in its historical context, and to add some element of drama. But overall, the novel mainly focuses on family, and on the fact that all colors can combine together to form a wonderful family unit.<br />This story will really grow on you, if you let it.	2004-02-20

He is dating a woman from a rich family that doesn't consider him son-in-law material.<br />Out of the blue, Clay receives an offer that is too good to be true.  As a reader we realize this, and one would think that any decent person would see it as well, except if the person's judgement is clouded by greed.  This is what this entire novel revolves around.  <br />Clay completes a few extremely lucrative settlements, guided by a mysterious source named Max Pace that just happens to have access to secret reports that can help him win his cases. <br />In my opinion, the story drags on a little bit when Grisham describes the various cases his main character is involved in, especially since there doesn't seem to be a common thread between them.  There also doesn't seem to be much in terms of a resolution in the story involving Tequila Watson, the case Clay was working on when he sold out for the money.	2003-12-21

It all starts in 1935 when young Briony Tallis witnesses events involving her sister Cecilia and Robbie, events she can't fully understand or accept. This leads Briony to give false testimony, accusing Robbie of a crime he did not commit. <br />The first part of the novel revolves around the presentation of the cast of characters and the dinner that would change their lives. Part two centres mostly on Robbie, a few years after that night and the retreat from Dunkirk during the war. The last section brings us to 1999 at a family reunion where the whole truth is finally revealed.<br />Although this story is in general very good and the writing excellent, there are many pages I spent reading wondering if the author would get to the point, or at least get somewhere. This was for me especially true during the long description of the retreat. Another problem was the extremely predictable episode where Robbie writes two notes of apology to Cecilia, one with obvious sexual comments, the other very polite. The reader can see what will happen many pages before the author gets to the expected conclusion.<br />Although I loved the characters and the prose of this novel, I would not recommend it as a \\"must read\\" to anyone. However, if you are looking for a slow-paced, well-written novel, you will probably enjoy this book.	2003-11-29

But, although the plot and its development were quite good, I found some of the style elements of this book rather annoying. For example, the numerous paragraphs filled with questions to lead the reader on (What will he do?, Where to go now?). This shows a certain limitation in the writing style I don't remember seeing much in previous novels. Perhaps these were part of the 10% not written by the author himself...<br />Also disrupting were the excessive missing words, word order inversions and typos found in the edition I read (the hardcover first edition by St. Martin's Press). This made it look like a rush order to bring this book to the public, but it also shows a certain lack of concern for quality. I would recommend waiting for a second edition to be published if you are also bothered by such details.<br />However, the plot is interesting and I found myself immersed in Ludlum's world of espionage and intrigue once again. Although a small part of the story line is quite predictable, the author manages to through in enough spins to keep the reader guessing and turning the pages.<br />Enjoy!	2003-11-15

But between her hectic work schedule, her children's needs at school and at home, and her husband, can she maintain her pre-motherhood life style? <br />Such is the premise of this novel written in a voice similar to that of Bridget Jones's Diary. Allison Pearson gives us a peek into the life of this frantic woman, trying to do everything, and be everything to everybody. Contrary to Diary, however, this book does present certain issues, albeit in a rather humorous manner, relating to parenthood and careerism.  For example, while the main character wants to stay on her career path, her coworkers don't seem to understand when she has to leave early to pick up the kids. In contrast, when one of her male coworkers leaves early to attend a school function, they all seem to ooh and ahh in admiration of his dedication to his family.<br />What I found very funny in this book is the competition between the stay-at-home mothers and the working mothers.  As the working mothers try to be as \\"perfect\\" as the stay-at-home ones (described as being disciples of Martha Stewart), trying to outdo them at all school functions, they just seem to get more and more frazzled as they realise they just don't have as much time on their hands to prepare home baked goodies and such.<BR>  <BR>Readers will enjoy reading about this poor woman trying her best to do it all.

However, I must admit to not having found this particular novel as compelling as some of his other works.  He has an ability to write a novel revolving around complex legal issues, without reverting to heavy legal jargon.  Anyone can understand, and I think many authors could learn a lot from Turow on this point.<br />Except for Arthur Raven, who you can't help but want to cheer for, many of the other charachters in this cast seem cold and unloveable.  The romance between Muriel and Larry just didn't have any appeal to me, perhaps because of the underlying anger they both carry around.  The accused in this novel, Squirrel, is a black man with an IQ below 80, and Turow represents this very well in the dialogues between this man and Raven, his lawyer.  However, the thickness of Squirrel's accent and his lack of education are painful to read, but fitting to the character nonetheless.<br />If I were asked to rank Turow's novels, this one would be at the bottom of the list.  But compared to other novels, that's still high praise.	2003-05-31

I felt like giving up on it a few times early on, but there is a turning point in the book where all of a sudden I just couldn't put it down anymore.  Atwood weaves a series of tales separately, and yet together.  It is obvious that these stories will become one in the end, just like any other novel.  However, Atwood does this brilliantly, using poetic prose, imaginative metaphors and splendid comparisons.<br />One reader complained about the informality of using the second person singular to address the reader.  I think this reader didn't get the point that he wasn't the reader being referred to, but another character in the book that was meant to read the details of the lives of Iris and Laura Chase.<br />I have often been disappointed with Atwood's novels in the past, but this one was as enjoyable to me as The Handmaid's Tale.<br />Read it, and stick with it. You won't regret it.	2003-05-19

This story revolves around Ella who finds herself feeling responsible for her parent's financial misfortunes.  In order to replenish their savings, she takes on numerous odd jobs around the neighborhood, including assisting her friend Nick in setting up a documentary.<br />The good thing about Maeve Binchy's writing is that her stories are about ordinary, believable people.  This book is certainly no exception, especially since many of her previous characters have cameo roles.  I did however find myself feeling I was reading a novel that was just three notches above a Harlequin at one point.  The &quot;it's too good to be true&quot; adage does not surprise, and you do figure out very early on where the plot is headed.<br />So if you feel like reading a nice, happy, very well written story about lovely people, then this is the book for you.  If you are looking for something that will make you think, or that has a little bit of intrigue, stay away! This one is predictable.	2003-04-22

Such things as a character being about to say what happened to the judge's nomination being interrupted by a ringing telephone, or followed by a double dash can be infuriating after over 200 pages.  <br />Many a paragraph I skipped, seing absolutely no added value to it other than to &quot;prove&quot; to the reader that he can write.  Personally, had the author been able to sustain my interest in his book, then I would have thought him a good writer.<br />This book is long, and does present potential, but the reader must be extremely patient, and not have a better book sitting on a shelf just waiting to be read...	2003-03-23

The only other problem is that Ben Hartman doesn't know why.<br />As the story unfolds, Ben starts piecing together the reasons why this is happening to him, everything being linked to knowledge his twin brother possessed before his death.<br />The pace with which this novel is written brings the reader right into the \\"movie\\" being told, in true Ludlum style.  Although I did find some unnecessary repetition and a \\"James Bondish\\" feel to the plot in the end, I did very much enjoy this book and do recommend it.	2003-03-16

And not just because of the number of pages.  The author takes his sweet time developping the numerous plotlines in this book.  A little too much time in this reader's opinion. But the plots themselves seem so interesting that you do keep reading on, skipping perhaps a few useless paragraphs along the way.<br />Clancy starts off with the destruction of the greater part of the American government body, and adds to that political turmoil involving Iran and Irak, biological warfare on the USA with the Ebola virus, and much more.  The only plot that starts and then goes nowhere is the one regarding the former vice-president who tries to discredit Jack Ryan's appointment as president. It's as if Clancy just lost interest in this matter or just didn't know what to do with it and just decided to let it die out, hoping readers wouldn't notice.<br />In these times of possible war, reading such a novel makes you wonder if terrorists won't take some of the ideas presented by the author and actually decide to apply them.  A little scary.<br />If you have a lot of time on your hands and enjoy reading political/military novels, then by all means read this book. If not, you might get annoyed by the use of every possible military acronym out there (and not all of them explained to the reader)and the very slow developping plot.  There are many more interesting books out there, some of them even written by Tom Clancy.	2003-03-08

The storyline is interesting - excentric spiteful billionaire wanting revenge one last time on his ungrateful children and ex-wives. However, there is a lack of tension in this story, which seems to end a little too easily and with apparently no conflict. The winning side in this case is clear right from the start.

US	43846144	R2MSWUSNUXZ9TT	0007141076	958226210	Unless: A Novel	Books	5	36	38	N	N	Delicious	I've read some of the other reviews about this book, and found some of them a little bit intriguing.  One reader mentionned expecting a fast paced story, as you would find in a mystery or detective novel.  This has never been what Carol Shields has been about.  She writes in this case about a 44-year-old mother of three/author/translator who tries to cope with her oldest daughter seemingly turning away from life, choosing instead to beg at a Toronto street corner every day with a sign around her neck saying &quot;GOODNESS&quot;.<br />Other readers felt it had no plot.  Again, Shields develops characters and not intrigues. She tells the story from Reta's point of view.  The &quot;plot&quot; is in trying to comprehend the circumstances leading to her daughter's behavior, in figuring out if she, as a mother, has done something wrong, if the same thing will happen to her other children.  Also, in figuring out what is goodness.  Throughout the narrative, Shields exposes various forms of goodness. <br />This book is filled with interesting, down-to-earth characters, expertly developped by the author.  The story contains many humorous touches, not the least of which are Reta's letters to various authors, as she complains about the non-representation of female writers in male writers' essays.<br />I hope you will enjoy this book as much as I did.	2003-02-02

Having seemingly no social life to speak of, Senhor José spends his leisure time collecting news item clippings about famous people.  One day, he runs across the birth certificate of an unknown woman, and becomes obsessed with finding out everything about this woman.  This is the main thrust of the novel, written in Saramago's particular style.<br />The story just sweeps you along from page to page, never letting you want to put the book down.<br />I recommend it to all Saramago fans, and also to those wanting to discover this great novelist.	2003-01-08

In a big way.<br />This book is a collection of short stories told in the style of &quot;Sheherazade in 1001 nights&quot;.  Each story has a little bit of magic in it, as is often the case with latin american literature, and interesting characters.  <br />I fell in love with this book, and wished for more.

You find yourself cheering for the ladies as you read.<br />However, the story takes quite a while to get going.  But once you start reading it, you get so attached to some of the characters, mainly Ria in my case, that you bear through the longer bits because you just have to know what happens in the end.<br />Great main character, nice feel-good story.	2002-12-31

We see how these strangers (who remain nameless throughout the book), now isolated and blind, try to cope with their condition and each other. <br />Apart from a few passages of violence, I found this story fascinating, and Saramago's writing style innovative.  No wonder he won the Nobel prize for literature.<br />Well worth it.	2002-12-30

The author develops both of these stories side by side, but it remains unclear for many pages just how these two threads will merge.<br />However, once the blackmailing scam run from the prison library is completely revealed to the reader, the only mystery left is what sqeleton Lake has in his closet, and even that isn't a huge stretch for the reader to figure out.<br />The plotline in itself is quite interesting.  Grisham does have the talent to come up with schemes that will bring his faithful readers back to read his next novel, but the telling of this one left me unimpressed. I didn't feel the tension building as I did with The Firm, for example, but rather I could just guess -accurately - ahead a few pages (or chapters) as to where the author was headed with this one.  And since I like reading this type of book for the tension and the plot twists, I can only give it two stars, and hope that his next novel will be better.	2002-12-30

Once the brief has been read by the wrong (right?) people, she then must run for her life, helped by Washington Post reporter Gray Grantham.<br />If you like reading John Grisham novels, you'll most likely enjoy this book. His style is very well established, and you can almost feel like you are reading a movie script due to the pace he injects into his stories.  But personally, this is a case where the movie seemed to me more compelling than the book.<br />A decent book, a better movie.	2002-12-29

Although this implied having to be in proximity of a CD player while reading, it was a lot of fun and the music selection is quite interesting as well.<br />If you have to choose between this book and Like water for chocolate, go with the latter.

The story is told in true Ludlum style, with enough intrigue and interesting characters to keep you turning the pages.

Although she has worked as a nanny before, she very quickly becomes much more than a nanny to the X family; she is also asked to pick up gifts, dry-cleaning, etc.  Her employer, Mrs X, is quite a number.  Nanny must make herself available to Mrs X to a much larger degree than what she had accepted when hired, and soon realises that she now has this job because the previous nanny had the nerve to ask for a week off.<br />What I liked the most about this story is the portrayal of a profoundly dysfunctional upper class family in NY who leave the bringing up of their child to &quot;an employee&quot;, while whining to all of their friends about how demanding a child can be.  Not that they would know, since they're never around!  It also is a very human story as we see the impact these behaviours have on poor little Grayer.<br />I strongly recommend this book.	2002-10-01

She manages The Open Arms, the family home which also serves as a party locale rented out for various types of occasions.  Rebecca always seems to be doing everything on her own, and taking care of everybody around her, and everybody seems to expect her to do so, because that is who she is.  Or is it?<br />Rebecca starts to question who she is and what happened to the Rebecca of her youth, the person she was just before she met Joe, her husband, back when she was in college.  The book revolves around her search for the Rebecca of the past.<br />However, I never saw the Rebecca character evolve.  She makes a start toward one potential outlet, but never actually takes that step.  It seemed pointless after a while for me to hope that she would transform and recover some happiness, after having taken care of the ungrateful now all grown up step-children who have been taking her for granted for so many years as they expect Rebecca to manage their lives for them still.<br />The supporting cast of characters are less interesting than those usually found in Tyler's novels, except for Poppy who has been preparing for his 100th birthday party for months.  Besides the dead husband, I didn't feel that I would want to meet any of these people, ever.<br />This story has the potential for being just as wonferful as Tyler's books usually are.   But it seems that the author wanted to leave her main character in misery.  Unfortunately, since I wanted and expected her to move forward, even just a little, I felt disappointed after reading the last page seeing that she had not really evolved.	2002-09-28
