The story in a nutshell - Chris Bacon, a microbiologist and son of an American ambassador, discovers in the forest of Papua New Guinea a plant which holds the key to human immortality.  As Chris and his family find out, there are many people that will stop at nothing to get their hands on such a potion. <br /> <br />Closer to a made for TV movie script than anything resembling literature, the action never stops and includes Caribbean drug lords who murder people for amusement, corporate fraud in the millions, crazed religious fanatics both Muslim and the home grown kind, a family homicide/suicide, a car chase scene involving shooting, faked identities and living undercover for 15 years to escape mass murder charges, and a passenger airplane exploded with a bomb.  Quite amusing to see all the plugs for Xanax, and the \\"with everyone living longer the Social Security System will collapse\\" agenda.   <br /> <br />Cliche characters, and a plot line that is less believable than the concept of immortality, even so an enjoyable read, great book for traveling with. <br />	2005-01-13

A third influence which shadows both stories is a group of people known as the Canadians, their motivations are not revealed to the reader yet without the actions taken by these Canadians the stories with happy endings told in this book would not have been possible.<br /><br />Lesra was 15 when he was hired to work at a lab in Brooklyn as part of an government funded summer program for inner city youth, it was there that he met a group of Canadians who were working at the lab on a research project.  He was invited to visit them later for a weekend in Toronto and they were shocked at the appalling state of his education, though in high school he was unable to read or write and had an extremely limited vocabulary, didn't know how to read a map and had never run on grass.  Lesra moved in with them in Canada and they took over his education, Lesra eventually went to university and his whole story of being rescued from a ghetto life and realizing his full potential in a different environment is uplifting.<br /><br />As Lesra is discovering whole new worlds through books he comes across, \\"The Sixteenth Round\\" by Rubin Carter, and Lesra begins writing to Rubin in prison.  The group of Canadians become involved with the Hurricane and the rest of the book is devoted to the freeing of Rubin Carter, the incredible amount of work it took and the history of Carter's case in the courts of New Jersey.<br /><br />Though the book was engrossing there is too much left hanging, mainly what is the motivation of the Canadians and who are they really?  Also the title is somewhat misleading as we don't hear much about Lesra except at the beginning.  Finally, if it is true as suggested in other reviews here that Rubin was having a love affair that went onfor several years with one of the Canadians, then that would most certainly be a glaring omission giving quite a different view of the same story.	2005-01-08

Jesus is not a god, Mary is not a virgin and there is no resurrection in this story which is told in four books narrated by Judas Iscariot,  Mary Magdalene, Simon of Gergesa and Mary the mother of Jesus.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed the book as a stunning piece of historical fiction  - through the character of Judas we get a view of life under the Roman occupation along with the usual toadies ready to sell out their own people.  Vivid descriptions of the lakes, the fishermen and wharf areas make the countryside come to life, and most unforgettable is the magnificent temple of the Jews with the smells of blood and smoke from the animal sacrifices and tables of money changers.  While I was reading \\"Testament\\" it was easy to slide into the past and imagine life in ancient times. <br /> <br />That anyone would be able to take the story of Jesus and put such an new slant on it is a testament to the writing skills and imagination of Nino Ricci, and to be able to make the story suspenseful is very impressive.  By the same author I have also The Book of the Saints with its poetic and beautiful style of writing, then \\"In a Glass House\\" so emotional penetrating it was almost too painful to read - Mr. Ricci is one of those writers that always surprises, continuing to get better and better. <br /> <br />	2004-12-22

Morality in this novel is left open to the reader's judgement and interpretation.  Set in the 19th century French countryside it is a tragic tale of a marriage between Emma Rouault and Charles Bovary told in three parts.<br /><br />Begins with a brief but thorough look at the early life of Charles  - his education, career as a \\"health officer\\", first marriage, his wife chosen by his mother for her money, a sickly unappealing widow much older than he, then meeting Emma through a call to her father, his wife's timely death.  Emma is young and inexperienced, her head filled with romantic fantasies and an active imagination.  Their courtship is brief and the story really begins with the marriage of Emma and Charles.  Quickly Emma finds herself  stuck in a dead existence, not only does Charles lack imagination he is as dull as a post.  Flaubert explicitly tells us just how stupid Charles is such as when he goes to a ball and stands for 5 hours watching a card game not knowing what else to do or in the case of the horrible operation on the man with the club foot.  Doomed from the start by incompatibility the relationship spirals downward from disillusionment, to an unrequited attraction, a nervous breakdown, move to another town to get away, affairs, child neglect, debt and suicide.<br /><br />Still a timeless classic worth reading for anyone who feels trapped in circumstances beneath their capacities, in a world too small for them.  There was little choice for a woman in the 19th century countryside as Emma reminds her lover, she cannot make her own living in the world or choose to court who she wants.  Her great imagination and feeling nature with no outlet for it dooms her to eternal loneliness, controlled by passions that are never satisfied and eventually leads to delusions and debauchery.	2004-12-19

Born Ada Delutuk in 1898, when she was eight she was taken in by Methodist missionaries in Nome and talk to read, write, sew and cook.  At sixteen she married Jack Blackjack, was divorced at 21, one son out of 3 children survived, but she was unable to care for him because of his tuberculosis.  She was persuaded to accompany a group of young men on a land claims expedition to Wrangle Island, a desolate place above the Arctic circle between Canada and Siberia, to cook and sew for them.  For Ada the money is good and will enable her to support her son she is promised the mission will be for one year only and that two other Eskimo families will accompany them, but they abandon the mission at the last moment. <br /> <br />This mission had been organized by Vilhjalmur Steffanson, an irresponsible publicity seeker who influenced the young men to go, in their eyes Steffanson was a hero.  It was his opinion that it was as easy to live in Arctic  as anywhere else, nothing to it, though he himself had never done it, and had already led a disastrous mission once before, he had abandoned his crew and men had died.   <br /> <br />Ada and her companions set out in September 1921, under supplied but even so they survived.  After a year though the relief crew and ship promised by Steffanson did not arrive and then things became more desperate as supplies were too low to survive another winter.  It was decided that Ada would stay with one of the men too sick to travel and the other three would strike out across the ice for the Siberian coast  When the ship finally did arrive in 1923, Ada was alone. <br /> <br /> The author has done an incredible job of taking a dry event from the past and making it come to life.  This is a great historical novel and I have put her book \\"The Ice Master\\" on my list of books I want.  There are numerous excerptsfrom newspaper articles written at the time and letters written between the families left behind.  I loved Ada's story of The Lady in the Moon,  and found it striking that she was able to survive under formidable conditions but had trouble functioning in a city.  Her life of drinking, TB and broken marriages is sad, but she still shines through as an inspiration and a survivor. <br />	2004-12-19

When he became the emperor he tried to bring back worship of the \\"old gods\\" and oust Christianity, a religion not favorably portrayed, though neither are the old ways of oracle and sacrifice. Three different views of the same historical events are presented by having three different narrators - Julian himself, and Libanius and Priscus both philosophers who knew him.  The philosophers are carrying on a correspondence regarding Julian's autobiography sometime after his death at age 32. <br /> <br />Well written and researched, this book invites fascinating \\"what if.......?\\" speculation; just imagine if he had reigned longer and been successful what a totally different place Europe would have been.   <br />	2004-11-23

When he sees the success of one of his old cronies, Rauf Ilwan, he hates him too and desires vengeance.   He seems driven by circumstance, yet later when he is given opportunities to change, he does not take them, knows only how to be a thief and nothing else. He is unable to change, blaming everyone except himself for his problems and soon seeks out \\"Tarzan\\" and his sleazy club out in the dark of the desert, drawn back into the criminal underworld.   <br /> <br />A psychological study of someone bent on self-destruction. <br /> <br />	2004-10-30

Also though some parts flow almost like poetry with descriptions of place settings in the Sudan beautifully told, I felt there was something missing in the translation, it was difficult at times to follow the changes in narrators and time periods. <br /> <br />Story opens with a teacher in a village in Sudan, he has been away for some years, and when he returns meets a new man, Mustafa,  who has married and settled in the village.  Mustafa's history is eventually revealed, born with his mother as his only family, his intellectual abilities and brilliance was noticed early, British people took over his education, and when he reached his late teens moved to England.  Because of his big brain and success he is welcomed by British society and could go far but Mustafa's weakness is his insatiable womanizing.  His seductions by creating a prototype African image for himself are hilarious.  The problem is that his girlfriends all seem to commit suicide, except for one - the woman that he does marry, Jean Morris, he has a masochistic attachment to reminiscent of \\"Of Human Bondage\\". <br /> <br />So much stuff touched on both in the village in Sudan and in the experiences of a Sudanese in London and so little explored and explained.   <br /> <br />	2004-10-30

Just a poetically told simple fable for mystics about a boy who has a dream and goes off to the Pyramids in Egypt to seek treasure.  The usual truisms of spiritual evolution are presented - listening to the inner voice and when the student is ready the guide will appear.  Just a very short book as beautiful and easy to read as a fairy tale. <br /> <br />So how about the negative reviews?  Not that there are negative reviews, of course any book is as easy to dislike as to like, but the sheer hatred expressed by some reviewers, both for this book and for the type of people who would enjoy this book really blows me away.  Some people do not even grasp metaphor, for instance that the buried treasure is not actually material but only a symbol like buried treasure in any fairy tale.   <br /> <br />This book is not a spiritual guide - personally I believe no one can be \\"guided\\" into spirituality, it is something that must awaken from within or not at all - it is only what it professes to be on the cover \\"a fable about following your dream\\".  Don't take the whole thing so seriously. <br /> <br />	2004-10-09

This one does not have the same scope as the trilogy, really just a novella or extra long short story with only 216 pages, a page turning psychological thriller that's easy to read in a night.. <br /> <br />One day while walking by a river Tom witnesses an accident and rescues a man from drowning.  Coincidentally this man turns out to be Danny, a child murderer now released who once was evaluated by Tom to judge if he was fit to stand trial in an adult court.  Tom decides to begin therapy sessions with Danny to help him understand his past, and more questions are raised than answered.  Readers that like nice clear cut endings might be disappointed with this, what is good and what is evil are very ambiguous in this story; and certainly will give pause for thought about child criminals, especially children who kill.   <br /> <br />I gave this a 4 star rating because of the plot line involving his wife - while interesting this was somewhat disconnected from the story.  The ending has been left wide open for a sequel and I wouldn't mind hearing what becomes of Danny Miller. <br /> <br />	2004-10-03
US	43849703	R3TJORVCYXLZHC	1594480001	659516630	The Kite Runner	Books	4	5	5	N	N	A novel of brotherhood	Set in Afghanistan in the then beautiful city of Kabul, this story is told through the eyes of Amir remembering his childhood as the only son of a rich merchant.  He grew up with Hassan, the son of his father's servant. Amir and his father, Baba are Pashtun, a privileged class in Afghanistan and Hassan and his father Ali are Hazara, a persecuted group thought to be inferior.  Though Hassan is Amir's best friend, when others are present Amir is ashamed of him; also Amir sees Hassan as a rival for the affections of  Baba.  A traumatic event takes place in which Hassan is badly hurt, but though Amir is a witness he does nothing to help and the guilt from this never leaves him.   <br /> <br />In July 1973 the Afghan monarchy ended in a coup, and when the Russians later invade Amir and his father flee in March, 1981 on a treacherous journey through the mountains to Peshawar in Pakistan, leaving Ali and Hassan behind forever.  Eventually they land in an migr community in San Francisco, poor but intact, and life goes on until one day Amir receives the phone call that compels him to return to the land that now belongs to the Taliban.. <br /> <br />While this is an exciting page turner and excellent for a first novel it is definitely not fine literature; the first half of the book has a lot of depth but as soon as he picks up the phone call from Rahim Khan it becomes a page-turning thriller full of cliches and implausible scenes, made for television or Hollywood or like a book based on a movie.  Even so I enjoyed it as it is the first piece of fiction I've ever read set in Afghanistan and the descriptions of Kabul then and now were fascinating not to mention life under the Taliban.  So little is known generally in the west about this part of the world that perhaps a sensational best selling thriller is the best introduction for many.  For fine lit set in the Mid-East try ABDELRAHMAN MUNIF.  Hope Mr. Hosseini develops the style evidenced in the first part and not the otherway around. <br /> <br />	2004-10-02

Considering that it was first published in 1890 the descriptions of poverty in the city and sexual directness must have been shocking.  The protagonist is a young aspiring writer who suffers from starvation and other depravations in order to enhance his art; the setting is Christiania (later became Oslo).  He is somewhat similar to the character Raskolnikov in \\"Crime and Punishment\\" in that the story is narrated as a streaming flow of an insane and erratic consciousness  <br /> <br />Excellent as the book is though, it is not one I would read a second time.  The main character did not elicit my sympathy, his suffering seemed needless to me something that could have been ended at any time were he not so stubborn and anti social.  Perhaps more of a \\"boy's\\" book, a more literary \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" with a more grown up character. <br /> <br />	2004-09-28

The narrator is Johnny Wheelwright describing his relationship with his best friend Owen Meaney from boyhood till their early twenties and his own life as he's writing the novel in Toronto in the late 1980's.  His memories are bittersweet, he lost a finger and a friend because of the Vietnam war before coming to Canada, and critiques American policies during the Reagan years which were current at the time the book was written. <br /> <br />As for Owen Meaney, he does remind me somewhat of Oscar from \\"The Tin Drum\\" as indicated in one of the editorial reviews here because of his perceptions of the adult world.  Owen is the only child of a granite quarry owner, brilliant in spite of physical aberrations, insightful and even able to see the future, but deprived emotionally and brought up by parents so ignorant and stupid that they tell him when he's still young that his was a virgin birth and he is just like the Christ child.  He grows up accepting this role of a savior to others and he later joins the army believing he is fated to die in Vietnam.  All of Owen's dialogue is printed in capital letters, reminiscent of bibles where all of Jesus' dialogue is printed in red. <br /> <br />Sounds serious but this was one of the funniest novels I've read in ages, laugh out loud descriptions of growing up, life in the fifties and all the changes during the sixties.  The characters are eccentric, some even bizarre in the usual John Irving style.  I especially enjoyed the ongoing commentary on television through the character of the grandmother who observes when she first sees one that television hastens the process of death, then becomes an addict and eventually dies with her hand frozen on the remote.  A more serious critique of  television is presented as the years pass and the news and politics become \\"made for TV\\" as Owen would say.   <br /> <br />There is a political agenda to this novel, the reader is meant to see the analogy between the selling of the Vietnam war and the selling of Reagan times policies.  The book is even more relevant now, with quotes like \\"....God \\"supported\\" the U.S. troops in Vietnam.....to not support the presence of those troops was both anti-American and ungodly.\\" or  \\"...selling Jesus stories like junk food, soon there'll be an evangelist in the White House.\\" , I'm sure this book will stay timeless for quite awhile.  <br /> <br />	2004-09-25

The story is chiefly told through the eyes of three characters - Odysseus cast here as a clever politically ambitious manipulator, Calchas an Asian priest of Apollo and soothsayer to the king, and Sisipyla a slave that Iphigenia received as a present years before.  Through the character of the Singer many tales of gods and goddesses are worked into the book. <br /> <br />A group of Greek rulers, among them Achilles and Ajax, and their troops are sailing to war with Troy under the command of Agamemnon, ostensibly to avenge the insult to Menelaus, brother to Agamemnon, whose wife Helen was \\"abducted\\" by Paris the Trojan prince.  Strong winds are sent pinning the Greek fleet in harbor and an oracle  reveals that the only way to appease the angry goddess who sent the winds is for Agamemnon to sacrifice his own daughter Iphigenia.  Agamemnon sends for Iphigenia and deceives his wife Clytemnestra by telling her their daughter is going to be married. <br /> <br />Barry Unsworth is able to make this story come alive for the modern reader, even relevant to our times, though this is somewhat overdone.  A few of the references made me cringe, like \\".....fight a war without collateral damage.\\" or \\".....bound to look impressive on a person's CV.\\"  Even so, the book was enjoyable and surprisingly suspenseful considering the outcome was already known. <br />	2004-09-25

The setting is Russia, mainly Moscow and St. Petersburg in the 19th century and while it describes a way of life gone forever the human passions and ambitions make the book timeless.<br /><br />Love relationships are the main theme, a number of different relationships are set side by side for the reader, the main ones being Anna's suffocating and dutiful marriage to Alexei and her passionate affair with Vronsky; the marriage of Stepan and Dolly Oblonsky with all their children, him having one affair after another and she the suffering victim;  Levin and Kitty with their early rocky road and later happy marriage in spite of crazed fits of jealousy.  Of course it is the relationship between Anna and Vronsky that is the biggest story in the story, the attraction for each other is fatal and total, they give up all for each other and lose everything.  An equal amount of time is devoted to the life of Levin, a religious doubter who slowly comes to a deep sense of spirituality in all around him.  Through the Levin character the reader is introduced to beautiful descriptions of the Russian countryside and the peasantry that works the land.<br /><br />Published in the 1870's and still an immortal classic.	2004-09-09

I had previously read the Cairo trilogy, the story of several generations of a family, Midaq Alley is quite different, a soap opera about the people of the alley set over a short period of time, fast paced and very funny at times despite the bleak lives of the characters. <br /> <br />The setting is WWII, a generally prosperous time for the people in this story, some content with life in the alley, and others more ambitious dreaming of nothing but escape.  Strong characters with interconnected stories draw the reader into their lives - Kirsha the cafe owner with young male lovers, Hamida who is lured into prostitution, fat Uncle Kamil and his sweet shop, Abbas the barber who joins the army just for money to win a bride, Zaita the beggar and grave robber who performs surgery for a fee to create other beggars, Mrs. Saniya Afifi who will pay anything to a marriage broker to get herself a young husband, and several others with stories of their own to tell.  <br /> <br />I enjoy books that expose me to totally different cultures and ways human beings adapt to what life throws at them.  Midaq Alley was a journey to another time and the other side of the world.   <br />	2004-09-09

This is a many layered reading experience with much about the lives of native Americans in the twentieth century, comic scenes to make you laugh out loud, moments of intense passion, and spiritual theme throughout reconciling Ojibwe spirituality with Catholicism.  The novel begins with Father Damien at an ancient age being visited by the younger Father Jude Miller who has been sent to interview him about the possible sainthood of a nun from the reserve, Sister Leopolda, finally Father Damien is compelled to revisit events of the past and to tell his story. <br /> <br />At times Erdrich's writing is more like poetry than prose, though the different stories were beautifully told it was all somewhat disjointed for a novel, hard to keep track of the characters.  What really held my attention was the idea of someone living as the other sex for an entire lifetime, this is what makes this book unique and unforgettable for me.  I was curious all the way through as to what would happen when the \\"Father\\" died, that kept me turning the pages and was pleased by way the end finally came for Agnes. <br />	2004-09-05

Quoting from the blurb on its back cover, Extravagance is a novel of \\"financial mania\\" and is set in two time periods - London in the 1690's and New York in the 1990's.  It is a single story, that of William  Merrick, an ambitious young man. who comes to stay with his uncle in the big city, but moves from one time period to another, for example he could be having lunch with his uncle in 17th century England, leave and step into a cab in New York 20th century.  The same characters are having parallel lives and interactions with each other in both time periods.  This simply happens and is never explained to the reader, are they time travelers, a group reincarnation, a dream??????  It seems the only reason we are constantly shifted back and forth is to demonstrate the similarities in the two periods with regard to stock trading and sudden wealth.  Though the book's concept is intriguing and includes some clever and witty writing the actual plot simply did not hold my attention.  The cliche characters are totally one dimensional, shallow, greedy and predictable in every way.   <br /> <br />Perhaps OK for someone who enjoys historical fiction about money, particularly stock market money. <br /> <br />	2004-08-13
US	43849703	R2HARX663MFRZ1	9997519329	176007544	The Wanderer	Books	5	27	27	N	N	Medieval Adventure	Ever since reading The Egyptian, I have been checking out used book stores for anything by Mika Waltari, wish more of his books were still in print. He wrote superb medieval fiction and it was well worth the search to find a copies of both The Adventurer and The Wanderer.  The first part, The Adventurer is an  <br />adventure novel set in various parts Europe in the early sixteenth century with rich descriptions of both characters and places, it is the story of one man's life Michael, a bastard born in Abo, Finland sometime in the year 1502 or 1503 he believes.  Book Two, The Wanderer continues the adventures of Michael the Finn from Abo  and this time the settings are throughout the extensive kingdom of Suleiman the Magnificent, supreme ruler of the Ottoman Turks. <br /> <br />After setting out from Vienna at the end of The Adventurer, Michael and his friend Andy are captured by pirates and compelled to convert to Islam to avoid death, he eventually ends up as the slave of Ibrahim, the Grand Vizier, second most powerful ruler after Suleiman.  Michael's skill with languages is his gift and propels him to the front of the action again and again, traveling to Istanbul, Baghdad, Tunis and Budapest and experiencing many battles and sieges.  A great deal of the action also takes place in the shadier, behind the scenes world of the harem, where concubines and eunuchs take power by more subtle means.   <br /> <br />I highly recommend both or either of these books to anyone who enjoys medieval fiction with detailed and vivid scene descriptions and characters with depth.  The Wanderer is particularly unique as instead of the usual Crusades style story of Christians fighting Moslems, these characters embrace the other religion and move through the other world. <br />	2004-07-29

Though the book flows easily and is often humorous, she is not really a great writer, much of her day to day descriptions are quite mundane even involving detail about her dog and his life, and so many different names of friends and acquaintances mentioned it is impossible to keep track.  However this adds to the book's effectiveness, the ordinariness of the people is a backdrop to the massive bombing, environmental devastation and later the sickness and birth defects.  This is not a book that discusses larger issues but is told entirely from the perspective of innocent civilians, here where Al-Radi resides the US/UK is perceived as doing more damage than Saddam. <br /> <br />Excellent choice for those interested in stories from inside Iraq.  <br /> <br />	2004-07-29

Except for the parts about the search for romantic liaisons, I found the book dull and sad, what a lonely life, it seems she only awakened in her sixties to all she'd missed out on.<br />As to her search for a man with an ad placed in the New York Times Review of Books, I found her experiences fascinating and admire her initiative.  Probably not so encouraging for seniors seeking partners since she goes from disaster to disaster with men her own age and older and does not achieve real satisfaction until she meets a lover half her age.  Could be an inspiration for the middle aged with the realization that passion and lust still burn in an old body, so don't wait till 67 like this woman did to start exploring that side of life.<br />Bet if it had been a 67 year old man with a 33 year old woman, there wouldn't have been half as much hesitation and self doubt.	2004-07-15

In the style one might expect from Erica (Fear of Flying) Jong, this myth is racy, insightful and funny ? imagine ?Clash of the Titans? with blatant sensuality.<br />The story begins  with our young heroine gaining the attention of Aphrodite and Zeus as they sit on Mount Olympus, the life of Sappho becomes a wager between the two of them, Zeus saying all her talents will be thrown away as soon as she falls in love.  Fated to be favored by the gods, Sappho moves from one adventure to the next and has intense love relationships with both men and women, though Alcaeus the poet and father of her child is the main love of her life.  Exiled from Lesbos for the crime of treason, she searches for love and inner fulfillment , her quest taking her to the island of the Amazons, to Egypt as companion to the Pharaoh, to the Oracle of Delphi, even a trip to Hades.  Aesop the fable writer is a close companion to Sappho as they encounter centaurs, sirens, and even Pegasus the winged horse.<br />Lots of fun.	2004-07-15

Perhaps the main theme is the indefatigability of human qualities such as imagination and quest for beauty in spite of oppression.<br />The story begins with two young men from the city arriving on Phoenix Mountain, the place they have been sent to by the Chinese government for reeducation, both guilty of being the sons of doctors.  Life among the peasants is bleak, the jobs assigned to them the most menial and dangerous and there is no intellectual stimulation.  Over time though two important things happen - first they meet the \\"little seamstress\\" the most beautiful and intelligent girl on the mountain, daughter of the area's tailor - and later they come into possession of a secret cache of forbidden books, all translations of western novels.  At this time period, all books were banned in China except for those written by Mao and his cronies and technical manuals, the boys have never seen foreign fiction before and now they have Balzac, Flaubert, Emily Bronte, Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Victor Hugo, Dickens, and many others, whole new worlds to explore.  <br />Quick to read with vivid descriptions, I will never forget the old man with the bed full of lice and jade dumplings with salty sauce.  Also loved the ending, the little seamstress has absorbed all the education Luo has to give and keeps moving on the path of self discovery.	2004-06-22

I enjoyed the author's going back and forth between past and present and switching between characters, it kept my attention.  While I found the book easy to read it was certainly not light reading, this is a story of slavery in America described through the personal experiences of several characters.  The main character Sethe is a black woman who escaped from slavery - when her \\"owner\\" tracked her and her children and was going to take them back, she actually killed one of her children rather than having her too experience life as a slave.  The book begins 18 years after that event, and it is a story about facing ghosts from the past.<br />Harsh as the book is, there are a few moments that are truly uplifting.  The scene where Sethe has arrived at Baby Suggs' house of freedom and wakes up to her first days out of slavery thinking of what to do with the day and getting to know other black people as unique personalities for the first time.  Also no matter how bleak the past, there's still a promise of something better for the future symbolized by the character of Denver.<br />In spite of all, the human spirit survives.	2004-06-13

The author was born in Jordan from Saudi Arabian parents, and this particular work has been banned in Saudi Arabia and several other Arab countries.  The relationship between the Americans and Arabs is seen from the viewpoint of the desert people, whose land is given away to foreigners by their own local rulers who grow rich from oil exploration.<br />The story begins in Wadi Al-Uyoun somewhere in the desert sometime in the first half of the twentieth century, the reader is transported into an oasis community whose people live much the same way as they did in ancient times, nothing ever changes here, they know very little of the world outside the oasis except the news received from the occasional caravan passing through.   One day some  Americans arrive, soon many more arrive, then one day all the trees are bulldozed over and the people are moved out and dispersed, and the drilling for oil commences.  A few make their way to a place called Harran, and the book follows the development of Harran from an out of the way caravan stop on the coast to a modern oil exporting sea port.  Rather than having a main character, the novel is really about the land itself and tells the story of many individuals.  <br />So few great books from the Mid-East translated into English, this is in the same class as Mahfouz's &quot;Cairo Trilogy&quot;, but this one's better for those interested in the roots of modern problems between the Arab world and the west.   The scene where the people watch the Americans come out in shorts to sunbathe, the chapter with the ship of women arriving , also the emir's obsession with one new toy after another, the telescope, the car and the radio - all is told in a way both hilarious and unforgettable, though a tragic kind of comedy.	2004-06-12

Braudel describes in minute detail the habits of various populations with regard to diet, drugs and drink, tools, fashion, furniture, home styles and decor, energy sources and so on.   There are numerous illustrations and so much info packed into this well researched work, it is easy to follow the development of capitalism in the west due to the changing needs of a growing population.<br />I gave this book a 4 star rating though because I found it too biased, perhaps the author should have concentrated only on Europe and not even touched on other parts of the world because he was not able to do them justice, whether from lack of information or lack of interest is not clear.  It is implied throughout the book that the western civilization is superior and even the natural rulers of the world.  I wondered too whether he'd change any of his conclusions about how great western development has been if he were publishing this today in view of global warming, pollution, and other legacies.<br />A great history of the mundane habits of Europeans, but NOT a balanced history of the world.	2004-06-12

Though Tomo is not yet 30 he has already tired of her and she has become used to his appetite for many affairs, while choosing a mistress for her husband can be perceived as an insult she considers herself fortunate to have control over what woman will be brought into her home and family life.  As the years go on a second concubine is acquired, geishas visit frequently, and eventually the aging Yukitomo even takes his own daughter-in-law as his mistress.  Through it all Tomo is left with the management of the estate and the care of the family.<br />Recommended for those who are interested in marriages involving concubines.	2004-05-30

When she comes into her money she decides to travel to Egypt, a place that has always captivated her imagination, against the wishes of her family who consider it frivolous and unbecoming for a woman to travel alone and a waste of money.  She goes anyway, on the way to Egypt she meets Evelyn who becomes her travelling companion and is enveloped in a mystery as soon as they arrive.  As they travel to view the pyramids and various tombs, they make the acquaintance of a pair of brothers also there for archaeological goals.<br />Slow and predictable at the start and not very complex as a mystery,  I still enjoyed it immensely for several reasons - most of all for the comedy, as the relationship between Peabody and Emerson developed their acid dialogue had me laughing out loud, and I was also interested in the graphic descriptions of Egypt a century ago, the journey on the Nile, the pyramids, the people and study of antiquities.   Quite a comment on the British traveling through the \\"colonies\\" and handling ancient artifacts, prejudices and all, there are a few references sprinkled throughout the novel to historical events such as fighting in Sudan.  I look forward to reading Book Two of the Peabody series.	2004-05-27

Alongside the larger group of natives and other people of color or lower class there is a small core group of Europeans, among those the Goulds.  In spite of being third generation South American Charles Gould still goes to England to find a wife.  Later when he decides to develop the silver mine he inherits from his father he goes to the United States to find a rich investor.  The silver mine becomes a huge success, only to become the target of political revolutionaries, and the story really begins when there is an attempted coup and takeover of the silver mine.  Much attention is given to inner conflicts and tough moral choices that individuals are forced to.<br />Detailed descriptions of both characters and settings makes this novel quite a dense reading experience, particularly the first section which contains very little dialogue and reads like a documentary.  Only the final section of the novel seemed deserving of the title Nostromo, part one is about Costaguana, part two the Revolution and only in part three does the reader finally become fully acquainted with Gian' Battista, or Nostromo as he is named by the upper class of Sulaco.	2004-05-24

When the king attempts to murder David on their wedding night, he flees and abandons Mihal who is then married off to another much older man, a farmer named Phaltiel.  Years later, after her brothers and father are wiped out and David has become king he comes back to claim her and make her queen, number one among his many wives and concubines.  The book includes the stories of David & Bathsheeba, Absalom's ambition, wars with the Philistines and the childhood of Solomon and is rich with detailed descriptions of palace life in Jerusalem, a new city at this point in time.<br />I was not so interested in this as a bible story but read it solely as historical fiction, it was somewhat interesting but often redundant, it seemed almost every section ends with something like \\"but I did not yet know, I was still blind...........\\" or \\"I should have known but did not then\\".   It is most of all a romance without too much depth.  There are lengthy descriptions of Michal's minute by minute feelings toward her husbands and scenes of passion, but very little of \\"Jewishness\\" for example, where are the daily rituals, religious practices, and special days?  There are prophets, but it seems none of the characters in the story have any spiritual beliefs whatsoever, something that I do not believe of people living in ancient times.  <br />Not bad and great for anyone who would enjoy a love story set in ancient times.	2004-04-24

Later after the initiation she \\"marries\\" her brother and they become co-pharaohs ruling Kam.  Many of Sekeeta's experiences as a ruler are described - holding audience and passing judgements, a sea journey to Minoa, the war with the Zuma.  <br />First published in 1937 this is apparently an autobiographical account of one the author's previous lives, but even if you can't accept the idea of this as a past life recollection, at the very least it is a really great read for historical fiction fans.  So frequently characters in ancient fiction seem to speak and function like twentieth century people with materialistic goals and romantic sentiment, but \\"Winged Pharaoh\\" has an authentic feel to it transporting the reader to another time and headspace.	2004-04-12

While the reader comes to know the three women through detailed accounts of their childhood years, Zenia and her motivations remain a mystery, at the very least she is a skilled liar and unscrupulous.  One by one Zenia steals their men and their money, and they are all in turn led down the garden path by her, their own inner weaknesses making them easy targets for a predator like Zenia.<br />Some parts of the story were a bit far fetched.  All the women seemed like caricatures, Toni the eccentric intellectual, Charise the spiritual New Age type and Roz the rich business woman, though this added to the comedy.  It was hard to believe that all three women had only ever had one love in their lives, also Zenia seemed without a soul and the others without a libido.<br />Fine literature it is not but a great entertaining read none the less, especially for women who have ever encountered a \\"Zenia\\".

From her family's point of view by marrying the Bendoro she is stepping up into a better life, from his she is nothing but a concubine or practice wife, and certainly not the first young virgin he has married then divorced and discarded.  Used to a free and open life in the fishing village where all have to work together for their daily food and where she has lived in humble surroundings, she does not know how to adapt to the isolated and lonely life she is forced into in the grand home of the Bendoro.  There is no other function for her other than to serve his needs when he chooses to see her, even when she eventually gives birth to a daughter, she has no claim on her own baby, her body nothing but a vehicle for bearing his child.  <br />The girl from the coast is unforgettable though we never even find out her name, and the final ending so beautiful it brought tears to my eyes.  I did not realize until the end how much this was a true story, how incredible that Toer ever met his grandmother at all and what an influence this woman had on his life.	2004-03-26

Set in the 1940's in a British Columbia rural area, the family ekes out a living on their farm, and Beth has a full share of the workload. The story is told as seen through her eyes in a straight forward as it happens fashion and as such does not offer solutions, explanations or even blame, this is a teenager telling about the only life she knows.  I found parts of her story heartbreaking but she does not, she does not have any other world to compare hers to and besides that many of the other characters are far worse off than Beth.<br />The father has a metal plate in his head from the war and is unstable, crude and has problems with anger, he is abusive to his family and workers, and forces himself on Beth sexually.  The mother seems even worse to me, for while she loves her daughter, she pretends not to see what is going on with the father, refuses to believe her daughter when Beth is attacked and stripped by other kids at school, and thinks she is faking problems with her arm when Beth is struck by lightning.  Perhaps the mother is incapable of protecting Beth as she herself grew up as a victim of incest also.  There are a few good relationships, with her brother Dan, and Billy, but most of the people in this novel struck me as bleak and/or ignorant.<br />Did like the mothers scrapbook and recipes, also the First Nations people stories were great.  Beths ability to keep seeking love and ability to see the beauty in nature made me feel shell make it out of there one day, would be interesting to see what became of Beth by the time she was 30 or so.	2004-03-05

The power is off, there is no more gasoline for cars, no phones, and little news from outside.  Nell and Eva are a pair of teenage sisters living in a forest in northern California miles away from the nearest town, their mother died of cancer before everything collapsed and their father in a freak accident.  The medical system has stopped functioning without power for equipment and refrigeration.  The sisters are fortunate to have had eccentric parents that lived out of town with a garden to grow food, a wood stove, a loom to weave cloth and a gun, and many other things that prove useful.  This is the story of their survival as told by Nell in the form of a journal.<br />It's true that some of the main questions are never answered.  We never really find out what actually happened and what's going on in the rest of the world, or the rest of the country even.  No one really knows, though it does seem that it wasn't one big disaster that ended it all rather multiple cracks throughout, overtaxed power system, overseas wars, collapsing economy, pandemics and we never really find out if it's going to get going again or not.  The male characters seem a little lame too, except the eccentric dad who is killed off, and there is that scene between the sisters mentioned by previous reviewers here that seemed superfluous to the story and stretched my credulity. <br />Even so, I could hardly put the book down, really made me think, if something like this did happen, I would NOT want to be in a city.  Most of us would be as helpless as babies without electric power and supermarkets to shop in.  The story is beautifully written too with vivid descriptions of life in the forest where every action counts.  If you enjoy \\"end of the world\\" stories, don't miss this one.	2004-02-24

It begins with Sophie Amundsen, a 15 year old girl in Norway in the late twentieth a century, receiving mail from a mysterious stranger, mail that turns out to be a course in philosophy.  <br />I found the history of philosophy as presented here interesting, some of the philosophers named here were somewhat familiar to me and I learned more, I liked the author's way of making connections from one stream of thought to the next over the centuries.  However when I came across anyone I know a great deal about such as Darwin or Freud, I found those sections of the book to be quite shallow and biased as well as to what was included.  I would have liked to have seen him go further with the twentieth century, how could he think of leaving out Carl Jung in a book like this????<br />The novel part of the book was totally unappealing to me, it just became too ridiculous.  Alice in Wonderland herself is a character, and the story seemed like wonderland to me something a mind under the influence of strong drugs might \\"dream\\" up.

This book will show you how our lives are controlled by corporations to the detriment of ourselves and the planet, featured topics are media control, growth of mood disorders, impact of television on human beings.  There is a very interesting history of the U.S. in regards to corporations, for the first hundred years or so after liberation from Britain VERY suspicious of them, somehow though the corporations managed to gain the upper hand in the 20th century, especially after the second world war.<br />This is not really a how-to guide for the activist, it is more to stimulate thought about certain issues and get you to pay attention and start thinking for yourself.  I already agree with much of the author's critique on modern life, but would not choose the same responses necessarily that he has or recommends.  A lot of the \\"memes\\" were great, \\"obsession for men\\" is hilarious and has been fun to pass along, also \\"we used to identify ourselves by our religion or political affiliation, but now we identify ourselves with the type of consumer we are, that is what kind of clothes we wear, the make of car we drive, etc. is what defines us as people\\", another one I enjoy repeating.<br />But read it for yourself, there's a little something in this for everyone to think about.	2004-02-22

The Adventurer is a real gem of medieval fiction, well worth the search to find a copy of this great historical novel set in various parts Europe in the early sixteenth century with rich descriptions of both characters and places. A few of the historical events covered are King Christian of Denmark and his attempt to unite all Scandinavia and the north under his rule, the early years of the Reformation with Luther himself making an appearance in the novel, and wars through the German and Italian states involving the Emperor Charles and the Pope.<br />Most of all it is the story of one man?s life Michael, a bastard born in Abo, Finland sometime in the year 1502 or 1503 he believes.  His father is unknown, his mother died, and his remaining family killed during a raid by the Jutes when he is still very young.  He is brought up by the town ?witch? and is somewhat isolated in his childhood.  Because of his intelligence, he is noticed by a priest and learns to read and write, receiving an education at the Cathedral school, and showing an aptitude for languages.  In spite of his intellect though, Michael is emotionally naive and often is a gullible simpleton when it comes to being manipulated.  The complications in his life compel him to move from one place to another and the reader is taken with him all the way on his journeys through Sweden, France, Germany, Hungary and Italy.  His inner nature changes as well, at the start he has absolute faith in whatever the priests teach him, as he matures he begins to look more within for his answers.<br />Highly recommend finding a used copy of this book for all lovers of historical fiction set in medieval scenes.	2004-02-16

Part one of the book, called \\"First Voices\\" recounts ancient legends and creation myths of the first peoples of the Americas, later comes contact with Europeans - the \\"discovery\\" years then conquest. Volume One of the trilogy takes the reader up to 1700 and recounts more stories from South America than the Caribbean or North America, though all parts of the Americas are touched.<br />Wish now I had read this more slowly, rather than reading this straight through like a novel, a few of these chapters a night would have been better, so many horrific stories of cruelty, oppression and genocide one after another were hard to absorb, overwhelming greed is really the theme.  Such a waste of human knowledge and experience, the destruction of the ancient books of the Mayans by the Catholic church was a loss for all humanity.	2004-01-30

She is the only woman in Elysium and thought to be very unusual because of her superior intellect.  Her life is a battle between cool reason and logic and her own intense psychic abilities, later there is pain because her great strength has little outlet in a female life.  She flees Elysium with two companions to the young city of Rome considered by Greeks to be an inferior society.  Some years are spent as priestess and oracle giver in a temple until she fakes her own death to escape with a lover and retreats into marriage.  Eventually Lucina does return to Elysium for a breath taking ending.<br />First published in 1947 this is apparently an autobiographical account of one the author's previous lives, but even if you can't accept the idea of this as a past life recollection, at the very least it is a really great read for historical fiction fans, there is an authentic feel to it.  Often very witty, the intense psychological explorations stimulate thought about the meaning of life.	2004-01-24

As a young reader I  liked it as a romance, but now can appreciate it for it's historical value - originally published in 1947, this is a novel of people living in harsh and brutal wilderness conditions, and how people pull together and help each other in small tight communities. <br />Mrs. Mike is the true account of Katherine Mary Flannigan from Boston, when she was 16 years old she was sent to her uncle John up in Calgary in the hopes that the Canadian climate would ease her suffering from pleurisy.  Calgary was still quite a wild place in 1907, and Kathy is one of the few white women for miles around.  She meets a Mountie named Mike, marries, and goes with him to Edmonton, and then on to Lesser Slave Lake by dogsled team where they will make their home amongst the villages where Mike presides as the law.  It seems like there is a Hudson's Bay trading post everywhere no matter how remote the area and many unforgettable scenes such as the forest fire and grizzly bears, lots of interaction with First Nations people, epidemics that wipe out whole families and villages.  Perhaps the best part is when she finally does return to Boston after years away and finds out there is no going back.  <br />A great novel about the Northwest Territories a century ago.	2004-01-15
US	43849703	R1AJH4FSKQQXBP	0786707496	191947686	Serpentine	Books	5	3	6	N	N	An international hustler	A fictional account of the crimes of Charles Sobhraj, a total psychopath, most infamous for his horrific spree of murder across several Asian countries in the seventies.  Known by several different aliases, he would cruise major hotels and tourist areas looking for tourists to ingratiate himself with, then drug and rob them.  Eventually he began to kill his victims, even burning some of them to death, moving from country to country using stolen passports, his blatant and arrogant attitude seemed to know no bounds.  It required police detectives from many cities and embassies to  merge their efforts to catch him and even acknowledge that there was a serial killer on the prowl, this took quite awhile and after all the effort by the end of this novel his only conviction was the one in India for 7 years<br />Born in 1944 in Vietnam, to an unmarried Vietnamese mother and an Indian father , unwanted by both parents, Charles spent his childhood in Vietnam, France, Africa and India moving from place to place and belonging nowhere.  He was highly intelligent and had a natural aptitude for languages, but early on in his life, perhaps because of his unstable childhood and rejection, he turned his abilities to the dark side of life.  From a young age Charles was able to manipulate and control others, a skill he developed throughout his life, becoming articulate in many languages and changing identities at the drop of a hat, able to convince otherwise innocent people to commit crimes for him and give him their money.  Caught for many of his crimes, he was able to slip from custody countless times with the help of others who remained fiercely loyal to him.<br />I had never heard of Charles Sobhraj before reading \\"Serpentine\\", have since discovered that he was released from prison sometime ago, profiting greatly from selling his life story, truly shocking.  While this book does have a sensational style of writing and not totally balanced, typical of pulp fiction from the seventies, I still enjoyed it immensely and would recommend it for readers of the true crime genre.	2004-01-12

He lives with his daughter, Marta, and his son-in-law, Marcal, who is a security guard at the Centre, a huge complex in the city where people live, work, and most importantly shop and consume without ever having to go outside.  For quite awhile the Centre had been Cipriano's only buyer of his earthenware crafts, their contract with him demanding that he sell to the Centre exclusively, and then one day his contract is abruptly cancelled.  At the same time, his son-in-law is expecting a promotion to resident guard which would involve leaving the pottery and moving the family into the Centre, but even so Cipriano and Marta make a last attempt to save the pottery from extinction.  More than just a story about aging, or traditional ways versus modern life, the suspense builds throughout this short novel as the reader is drawn into the lives and feelings of very realistic human beings.. <br />The close to nature life of the village and the globalized Centre are in total contrast and the drive from the village to the Centre is unforgettable, first passing the so-called green belt where nothing is green (and the insides of the strawberries grown there are white), then through the industrial belt, then the shanty town where the poor live, then through the city itself to the impenetrable fortress called the Centre.  Consumers are barraged with advertising slogans and expect to find everything (or a copy of everything) that can be bought from anywhere in the world as well as every imaginable form of entertainment including a casino, a racing track for cars, a beach with waves  - even sensations, like being in a tornado, or a blizzard can be experienced inside the Centre.  Most of the apartments in the Centre do not even have windows that look out, many of the residents prefer a view of the inside of the Centre itself, and half thedwellings have no windows at all.  <BR> <BR>I had never before heard of Plato's story of the cave, but I have learned about it since finishing this novel and once seen the connection is striking,  just the way the people in the cave are able to see only shadows on the wall which they mistake for reality, so the people in the center see and experience only artificial life, all in all quite a comment on global capitalism. This was my fourth book by Jose Saramago and once again I am struck by his slow and subtle but very powerful style as a writer.	2003-12-31

This is also an excellent look at the English social order, especially the working class poor.<br />I found the book difficult to put down at first it is an almost too painful and intimate view into the emotions of a lonely, sensitive and crippled orphan.  Real and right up front, you will feel some of Phillip's pain.  At some point though, which seems to vary depending on the reader's taste or focus the book really takes off and becomes a page turner, for me it was when he started to pursue medicine and went to the hospital, it seemed to me that was when Philip had found the path and his life took off, although there was still some backsliding when he encountered Mildred one more time. <br />Relevant to anyone who has been caught in an masochistic obsessive relationship, timeless in that sense, although the setting describes a way of life gone forever	2003-12-18

Instead his daughters refuse to even receive him in their homes, he has become only an object of shame and derision for them and lives on a pittance in a old boarding house, Maison Vauquer, run by the unforgettable Madame Vauquer, a widow of someone.  The main character is Eugene de Rastignac, another boarder at la Maison, a honest (at least at the start) young man from the country whose loving family has toiled and saved to be able to send him to law school in Paris, he is brought into the company of the rich and famous, the creme de la creme of Parisian society and begins to think of another path for himself than the one laid out by his family.  Almost everyone of the boarders is living for money, some more willing than others to do anything to obtain it.<br />As I was reading this I kept thinking of what a great stage play this would be, this is a true comic tragedy.  It was a little difficult to get into a first, it is a translation and a very old book describing times now gone for good, for me it began to flow more easily after 50 or so pages.  I think a modern day look too at Pere Goriot would not leave a reader feeling such pity for him because of his daughters' treatment.  He became rich by hoarding food and waiting for a famine to make a financial killing off desperate people, then educated his daughters and brought them up to feel themselves to be ladies and superior to other people, I felt like he deserved a lot of what he got, Rastignac is the one I was more interested in.	2003-12-17

Buck)	Books	5	32	34	N	N	Ruthless Ambition	All about Tzu-Hsi, last empress of China, who reigned from the 1860's until her death in 1908. She reigned during a period of great transition in China, as the book goes on there is increasing pressure from outside - the nations of England, France, Russia, United States and others demand from China increased trade and the rights to allow their citizens to live in China and their priests & missionaries to travel wherever they please.  Japan too is an ever present threat.  The empress was unable to adapt to modern times, and rather than building modern ships and arms that would have enabled China to defend itself, all the taxes collected were spent on luxuries and palaces for her, only at the very end of her days after defeat did she accept the idea that China could not keep itself isolated from all the other peoples of the world and finally opened to the idea of sending Chinese abroad to study foreign ways.  <br />The story begins with the teenager Yehonala, betrothed to Jung-Lu, she and her cousin Sakota are chosen to be royal concubines of the Emperor, a sickly and weak man who so far has been unable to produce an heir.  Through sheer guile and ambition, Yehonala becomes the favorite, and produces a son for the Emperor (or is it his son?).  When the emperor  dies, she becomes Empress mother, regent for her still young son, and upon his death she seizes the throne and becomes Empress in her own right, first sharing the throne with her cousin Sakota, then finally alone.  As Empress of China, Tzu-Hsi has absolute power and can raise people up or down, have them beheaded or bestow mercy according to her whim, but she is unloved and deeply lonely as the extremely powerful often are.<br />This is a great novel, there is never a dull moment or wasted word and I found it hard to put down, this is a fascinating look at Chinese history and Tzu-Hsi herself is unforgettable.  Selfish and sometimes foolish as she is, the reader is compelled to like her.  I remember first reading about Tzu-Hsi in a novel called the Forbidden City by Muriel Jernigan and I never forgot her, it was a real treat to discover this book, a really great work of historical fiction.	2003-12-01

The book starts with our hero Baudolino in Constantinople while it is being invaded and burnt, he has rescued Niketas, court historian and very rich man, and proceeds to relate his own amazing life story to Niketas.  Born a peasant in Italy, Baudolino was adopted by Emperor Frederick for saving his life, later a student in Paris, then in pursuit of the Holy Grail into the kingdom of Prester John.  Or is it all a lie?<br />Too many medieval events and characters all crammed into one book, and Baudolino was just not a likable enough guy  to make me care what happened to him, Niketas was more interesting to me with his wise intellect and sensual delight in eating.	2003-11-24

It is easy to understand why the author was imprisoned after the book's publication in 1977 as he presents a bleak view of what the Kenyans got in the way of leaders after independence from the white rulers. The viewpoint here seems to be anyone &quot;for the people&quot; is assassinated, those that stay in power are stinking rich doing business with the former white rulers and selling out their own people. <br />The story opens with a brief introduction of the four main characters - Munira, Abdulla, Wanja and Karega - a triple murder has just taken place, 3 leading millionaire government officials of the city of Ilmorog were burned to death in their beds. We are then taken back twelve years in time to when Munira arrived in the sleepy, dusty village of Ilmorog to teach school, The four friends meet and we hear their individual stories, how they change over the years but more so how the place called Ilmorog changes, from a dusty village to a modern urban centre, and the effect on people who lived there for generations.<BR> <BR>I found the book very dense reading at first, there so many African names introduced, also the style of writing with many flashback is challenging, but before page 100 I was sailing along and could hardly put the book down. There are many layers to this novel, it is a book about Africa, about the world history of black people in general, globalization, colonialism, and a murder mystery as well, the arsonist responsible for the triple murder is revealed to us by the end.	2003-11-17

He disappears and when no word is heard from him back at home, his father sends Simon's two brothers, his twin Charles and the elder brother Addington to the New World on a mission to find Simon and bring him home.   \\"The Last Crossing\\" is the story of their journey away from civilization and into the raw wilderness.  Some unforgettable scenes for me were the dance at Fort Edmonton, the \\"ghost village\\" where everyone had died of smallpox, the story of the Blackfoot going south past Salt Lake on a raid for horses, and the grizzly hunt.<br />The story is usually told in the first person,  but with continually changing and fascinating viewpoints as there are 6 different main narrators - the two brothers Charles and Addington, - Jerry Potts, the half Blackfoot/half Scottish hired guide, - Lucy Stoveall, a woman with her own motivations for accompanying the posse, - Custis Straw who is  in pursuit of Lucy,  and Aloysius, the saloon owner going after Custis for his own protection.  The characters are richly developed and believable, all completely different, some more likable than others.<br />I read this book in a day and a half, reading whenever I got an opportunity, it was so hard to put down and the ending was great and uplifting, filled with possibilities. Guy Vanderhaeghe is one of those authors whose books get better and better, I first read \\"Homesick\\", a moving family story, then \\"The Englishman's Boy\\", an intriguing look at early Hollywood and the wild west and now this \\"The Last Crossing\\", not just a western but really suspenseful historical literature.	2003-11-12

This is a soap opera set in the fictional town of Middlemarch with descriptions of every walk of life, George Eliot's perceptions of human nature make this a timeless piece of fiction, though there is no doubt that she describes a way of life gone forever. <br />A main theme in this novel would seem to be possessing Utopian visions and the difficulty of putting them into practice in reality.  One of the main characters is Dorothea, a young woman with great social ideals, she \\"thinks too much for a woman\\" and is under constant pressure from well-meaning realtives who want her to marry safely and give up her goals of saving the world.  Dr. Lydgate is someone else we come to know quite well, another individual who has lofty ideas but trouble coping with the real world because he tries to ignore it.  Mr. Brooke and Bulstrode also have certain visions of themselves not shared by an informed public.<br /> Some reviewers seem to feel this book is too long, that the story could have been told in half the words, but I would not change one bit of this, the beautiful use of words helps me to escape into the world of Middlemarch when life was slower moving and people had more time for reflection.	2003-11-04

This the first thing I have read by this author and for me it was also a fine introduction to a crucial period of Scottish history. This 3 part series covers the life of Robert Bruce, a truly dashing and gallant hero if there ever was one, and it is a true rags to riches story.  The whole series is well written and though lengthy is a pleasure to read with a medieval feel to it.  There are many battle scenes throughout the book, and detailed strategies described, the Scots being so outnumbered by the English had to be very clever to win.<br />Book 1 - Opens with Bruce in his 20's, a spoiled young nobleman, forced like all the other Scottish nobles to pay homage to Edward of England and be his lackey. Later his meeting with Elizabeth de Burgh, and finally the birth of his ambition.<BR>Book 2 - Hitting rock bottom with the capture and executions of his brothers, the imprisonment of his wife, and his other female relatives kept in cages, he is finally driven into the wilderness to live as a hermit.  Eventually, he rises again and is able to unite the many clans and tribes from the northern Highlands with the Norman/Celt mixed nobles from the south to fight together for the common cause of Scotland.  Part 2 finishes with the Battle of Bannockburn.<BR>Book 3 - Finally the undisputed King in Scotland though there is still the ongoing struggle to have England recognize Bruce as King of Scotland.<br />A novel I will enjoy reading again, especially loved the parts about Christina MacRuarie, ruling woman of the isles, also the Highland chiefs and sea captains.  So much historical detail with never a dull moment.	2003-10-14

Jammana is an intensely emotional child torn between the ancient way of life represented by her mother & her family in Ein Fadr  and modern times represented by her father who sees no future for them in the Mid-East and wants to go to America. <br />I was attracted to this book because it seemed to promise insight into a culture I know so little about and it does that, there is an intimate look into the hearts and minds of several of the villagers.  There is not much of real plot here though, rather most of this story is a child's memory.   After the magic of childhood the ending seems all too realistic and I was quite saddened by what became of Jammana's mother and father after all of it.	2003-08-22

Cannot properly call this a mystery since the outcome of the case and the identity of the killers is well known,  rather this account of the Manson family written by the prosecuting attorney gives insight into the bizarre motivations for the murders.  \\"Helter Skelter\\" covers the investigation of the murders and a detailed accounting of the trial, with great photo insert sections.  If  this story had been conceived of  and written as fiction it would not be believable,  here the truth is indeed stranger than fiction. <br />Charles Manson was the product of a severely dysfunctional childhood, and a life spent more inside prison or detention than out.  This individual, like a cult leader of a commune, was able to attract young people to him and have them become so devoted to him they believe he's Jesus Christ returned and are willing to [destroy] any random individual for him on command.  <br />I'm old enough to remember the Tate/Labianca murders when they were front page news, read the first edition of \\"Helter Skelter\\" way back, and really enjoyed this newer version with the added 1994 afterward by Bugliosi telling us where all the story participants are today.  I had no idea that some of Manson's ideas are still around, unbelievable what attracts some human beings.	2003-08-19

The part of this novel that impresses though is the overview of the Congo's colonial history and a more detailed examination of U.S. involvement in this region during the 20th century.  Some reviewers have criticized Barbara Kingsolver for &quot;pushing her political views onto her readers&quot; and &quot;having an agenda&quot;.  You bet there's an agenda here, and it's a great one, this kind of story needs to be told.  <br />I recommend this highly for western readers wishing to know more about Africa, colonialism, and/or U.S. foreign involvement.	2003-08-01

This author is an expert at plot twists and surprises which really shock the reader, allow yourself uninterrupted time for this book, it is a real page turner, melodramatic, a love story, a murder/crime thriller and great historical fiction.<br />There are so many twist and turns to this story that I find it hard to say much about it without revealing crucial parts of the plot. The main characters are 2 orphans, Maud and Sue, that have grown up leading vastly different lives and are brought together in their late teens.  At the beginning we are introduced to Sue and the family of thieves she lives among at the house of Mrs. Sucksby.  Sue is presented with a mission by Mrs. Sucksby?s friend whom she calls ?Gentleman? ?  The plan, in brief,  is that Gentleman will  marry an orphaned, isolated heiress then have her locked up in an asylum, stealing her money, Sue will pose as the lady?s maid and assist Gentleman in making his wife appear insane.  And that is all I will say.<br />I look forward to rereading this one day to look out for all the little clues I missed the first time.	2003-07-31

Looking over some of the other reviews here I see that this 1474 page novel has been called \\"just\\" an Indian soap opera, and while I think soap-opera may be an apt description, it is one of the best books I have ever read.  This novel reminded me of an old fashioned English novel in the style of Dickens or Trollope or Eliot, with a large cast of characters, a thick tome with many divergent plot lines that are eventually tied together by the ending, an incredible journey for a reader.  They just don't write them this way any more.<br />The title story of  the novel is the one of Lata Mehra and her search (or rather her mother's search) for a suitable boy to marry.  The novel opens at the wedding of Savita & Pran and introduces many of the characters we will be seeing more of later.  Lata is struck by the fact that her sister is marrying a total stranger, accepting passively a marriage arranged by the family,  later she will choose between passion and an arranged marriage for herself.  Maan Kapoor is another central character that we get to know in depth following him through his obsession for Saeeda Bai, exile from the city and the dramatic scene involving Firoz.  There's far more though than the stories of only Lata and Maan, both of whom are sometimes almost forgotten for several chapters,  so many other unforgettable characters amongst  the Mehra family,  Kapoors, Chatterjis, Rasheed & his family, the Nawab Sahib & his family, Saeeda Bai's establishment.  I found Arun & his wife Meenakshi, the anglophile snobs absolutely hilarious.<br />Besides being \\"just a soap opera\\" revolving around the lives of half a dozen families of Bramphur, this is an ultimate book about India following the years after the death of Gandhi and independence from  the British.  Partition and ever increasing tension between Hindus and Muslims are ongoing themes  and the continuing more subtle influences of the British on Indian culture.  Every walk of life is covered from the untouchables of the Rudhia district to the Raja of Marh and his son.   <br />Don't let the size of this book discourage you, I found it easy to read over a period of time;  each of the 19 sections is like a mini story in itself, with many short chapters in each section.  I took several breaks in reading this, always drawn back the way one is drawn back to a family and old friends to see what's become of them now.  Long as it is, I wished it could go on forever.	2003-06-11
US	43849703	R22ZEPC5TWLD9I	0553380958	445913	Snow Crash	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Story would be better as a cartoon than a novel	The beginning seemed interesting - an alternate American reality where roads have become towns, people live in storage lockers, toxic wastes sitting around with no one to care anymore and  violence gone out of control it's everyone for themselves in this society.  Also the concept of the Mega-verse was fascinating.  However...<br />The characters were cardboard and seemed to me unbelievable as real human beings, I could only imagine them as animation figures.  In a world where the most advanced weapon technology can been had by anyone that can afford to pay for them, Hiro Protagonist, our main man, is able to fight all his battles with swords.  He is the best sword fighter in the world, apparently descended from samurai, as well as a computer genius.  Then there's the main villain, Raven, he has a nuclear bomb inside his body who fights with glass swords able to cut through armor.  And YT, 15 years old, young, blond and attractive with the strength & fighting skill of several grown men put together, and the wisdom & vision of a seer. The plot too was weak, almost non-existent, the same old simple good versus evil battle, the Sumerian legend theory seemed far-fetched and ridiculous, even embarrassing.  <br />Maybe just not my kind of book?	2003-05-26

Though a number of people were in the area at the time, no one has apparently seen or knows anything and the crime remains unsolved for years.<BR> <BR>Bleak, slow moving who-done-it style mystery sent in a remote area of Sweden, this book is a compelling read because of its characters. As well as being a complex crime novel, an intricate puzzle with clues to be picked up along the way, this is also a psychological thriller exploring the depths of human depression. The theme of this story is loneliness & being the outsider - Johan is an outsider in his own family, the Starhill community is apart from the regular country people, Annie is outside the school community she teaches in, the Lapps are outside mainstream Swedish society, and Birger is the ultimate symbol of aloneness.<BR> <BR>This was my 2nd reading of this novel and was most helpful, the novel is so disjointed with several plot lines that this time I noticed so many more clues along the way. Events take place over years, eventually the different threads come together. I really enjoyed this book but more because of the all too realistic characters & the vivid detailed descriptions of the landscape than the actual crime plot.	2003-05-18

His bitter experiences in childhood leave him cold hearted and in pursuit of money at all costs, and he achieves incredible wealth and power in America. His goal at any price is to make his son president of the United States. There was a made for TV mini series based on this story.<br /><br />The other more interesting part of this book though is about the control of wealth and real power in the world in the hands of a few. Taylor Caldwell has written an add on to the story that is a warning that the &quot;controllers&quot; are not fiction and were more powerful than ever. In the Captains and the Kings some historical events described are the US civil war, the presidencies of Lincoln, labor struggles, the making of Teddy Roosevelt, and immigration. Was the civil war after all just an event arranged &amp; set up mainly by rich European bankers for profit? Are all wars always set up by a handful of distant people for profit? This book really makes you wonder	2003-04-30

Fortunately Tita is blessed with magical cooking skills that allow her to attract lovers and cast many types of spells over the people that consume her dishes, amazing events occur all around her.   Tita is not the only talented member of the family either, her sisters are notable personalities as well.<br />I recommend this as a light & funny escape from reality.	2003-04-30

Cyrus is old and blind, he has ended up in Athens in his last years, dictating the story of his travels and his life to his nephew and scribe, Democritus. In each of the places he describes - Babylon, Cathay, India, Greece, cities of Persia - his main focus is on the religious customs, particularly various creation myths. It is no secret that Cyrus definitely favors the one (male) god that created everything, we live one life - it's good versus evil and then there's either heaven or hell. <br />There is so much crammed into this book, which is both its' strength and weakness. There are so many characters in this book, especially in the parts dealing with the Greeks, that it sometimes reads more like a history lesson than page turning fiction. Over the course of his life Cyrus comes to know Darius & Xerxes, both Great Kings of Persia, Zoroaster, the Buddha, Confucius, Socrates, and Li Tzu, quite amazing for a single individual. Even so, it's the scope of this book that makes it so interesting, I thought the trips through what is now India and China were the best parts. Who were the Aryans, really? <br />In spite of its weaknesses, I can't think of any other work of fiction that introduces so many customs, traditions, and philosophies of the ancient world and also encourages an awareness of the vastness of human civilization and history.	2003-04-23

Each writes a testimony of her experiences with \\"the man on the beach\\" at the behest of his lawyer, Marie-Martine Lepage, herself the 8th & final narrator in the book and also yet another lover from his past. The women's stories seem to contradict each other - Emma , Belinda, Zozo, Caroline, Frou-Frou, Yoko, Toledo, Marie-Martine give varied accounts of the same man, some wanting to save him, others to kill him. The reader is left to pass judgement on the character of Christophe (or whoever) as he escapes from prison and kidnaps a young bride on her wedding night then is shot on the beach for rejecting her, hidden in a brothel by prostitutes, escapes by sea with an actress after punishing a schoolteacher, shipwrecked on a desert island, recovers in an army hospital, captured & returned to France to face his original crimes of rape & murder. All along, he claims to have been falsely accused of the crimes he was charged with.<br />The ending was a surprise and very appropriate.	2003-04-10

The main character is  Simon de Montfort, a French born nobleman who led a rebellion in England seeking to limit the rights of the king.  Each book of the series can be taken on its own, it's unnecessary to have read Book 1 to appreciate \\"Falls the Shadow\\".  There is less \\"romance\\" in this one compared to Penman's other novels and more focus on actual historical events, as usual a tremendous amount of historical research has gone into the writing.  She has a real talent for making characters from history seem like living, breathing human beings for the modern reader.<br />The story opens in 1231 with a young Simon arriving in Brittany where he persuades a cousin of his to grant him the Earldom of Leicester.  Several years later he persuades the sister of King Henry of England to marry him.  He holds true to principles ahead of his time, and ends up in one struggle after another with the king, easily overpowering weak & pitiful Henry, his brother-in-law the  king.  Of course, Simon is eventually brought down,  by both the ineptitude of his own sons as military men and the strength of Edward's army.  The last scene in this installment is set in 1267 after the slaughter at Evesham, the storyline is pointing in the direction of Wales once again.<br />So many great scenes - the citizens of London throwing refuse at the Queen on her barge, Gruffydd plunging to his death,  and  the decadent army camp outside the safe walls of Kenilworth castle are unforgettable to name a few.	2003-03-31

His wife of 13 years, his son and the whole small town are shocked to discover that Ethan has kept many secrets from them. <br />I shoud have paid more attention to some of the other reviews here.  Every page of \\"Blue Diary\\" had something that made me incredulous and the cliche characters were unbelievable.<BR>Truly Beyond Belief:<BR>- Can you imagine being married to a man for 13 years without ever thinking to ask if he has family or where he comes from?<BR>- Kat Williams insights coming from a 12 year old girl.<BR>- When a man hangs himself in the garage where his children or his wife will find his corpse it is not because he loves them too much.<BR>- Jorie going to visit the victim's brother.<BR>- Anyone being able to absolutely change personalities the way Ethan did.  A pathological criminal from a young age, described as a vain destructive boy - thief, already living off women as a  teenager, serves time in prison, rapes & kills Rachel and then changes into a saint in one night after falling in love with a woman in a bar.<br />Very disappointing read.	2003-03-31

It is a well-written story, historical settings, more fantasy than sci-fi action, slapsick comedy throughout, a book I would have enjoyed immensely if I'd read it when I was 11. Reading this book reminded me of watching Disney films like \\"The Absent Minded Professor\\", with prepostrous events and cliche characters. This is a humourous fantasy, but certainly not science fiction for grownup readers or good historical fiction.<br />I recommend this for young readers interested in the concept of time travel or the Victorian era.	2003-03-26

When the book begins, Brat has just returned to England, he is stopped by an aging actor while walking along a street.  The actor has been struck by Brat's amazing resemblance to someone he knows, Simon Ashby, who is due on his 21st birthday to inherit the family estate, though Simon was not the original heir - it should have been his twin, Patrick, who apparently committed suicide when they were 13. The actor makes Brat a proposition, he is persuaded to pose as Patrick come back and claim the family fortune. <br />This was my first Josephine Tey mystery, and it kept me up late, I couldn't wait to find out what would happen. Originally published in 1949, this author was well known for writing great mysteries that did not follow formulas. Tey has chosen the British countryside and the world of horse breeding as the setting for this one, an enjoyable read, old-fashioned, British, with a country pastor and a character called Aunt Bee. Some things are perhaps predictable, for example I guessed pretty early on who Brat really was, but there were still plenty of other surprises along the way. This would have been a great Hitchcock film.	2003-03-17

Interesting to read firsthand about the work of these courageous activists from France - Jose Bove is certainly not the leader of a group of country bumpkins or Luddites as I had inferred from the popular media. This book covers personal backgrounds & histories of their involvement in various farmers unions , these guys are effective organizers who know their business and also working farmers with a feeling and respect for the land, quality of life and food are goals of paramount importance. <br />Divided into 3 parts:<BR>1st - The McDonald's story and other planned protests told from the viewpoints of both Bove & Dufour. The McDonald's incident took place in response to import duties imposed on Roquefort cheese in retaliation for EU's refusal to import American hormone treated beef. Not a random or spontaneous incident but a well planned out protest carried out to attract public attention. Both Dufour & Bove have been involved more than 30 years in various movements for change in France. <BR>2nd - History of intensive farming over the last 50 years in France, farming economics, factory farms. Covers topics here such as genetically modified crops, mad cow disease, environmental destruction caused by intensive pig farming<BR>3rd - Farming as a global issue world trade organization and \\"free trade\\", protest in Seattle, growth of a movement, a new vision. <br />An inspiring read for those interested in food, farming and globalization.	2003-03-13

Maureen O'Donnell wakes up hungover one morning to discover her married ex-boyfriend tied to a chair in her living room, his throat has been cut and he has been viciously mutilated. At first, as an ex-mental patient she herself is the prime suspect, later turns into an amateur sleuth and eventually solves the case herself using her personal knowledge of the mental health world & her network of friends to assist her.<BR> <BR>Some of the characters in this book are unforgettable, especially hard-drinking, cursing like a trooper Maureen, one of the more unique female main characters I've come across in awhile. Also her perpetually drunk mother, Winnie (no one ever mentions that Mother drinks), her brother Liam the drug dealer, the sisters - 2 total hypocrites in heavy denial, her family is hilarious, a comic tragedy. <br />While I enjoyed the book, I found a couple of things not credible and not explained. It was not clear to me why so many were quick to believe it was Maureen, when it would be difficult physically for many females to subdue a man & tie him to a chair. Also, I wish more time had been spent on the actual killer, it was such a surprise, what made him tick? I really look forward to reading the next book in this series, hope to see what happens to Maureen and her family in the future.	2003-03-11

The cast of characters in this novel include Richard the Lionheart, King John, Eleanor of Acquitane, Philipe of France and numerous other counts, lords earls, princes etc. The research that went into this book is awesome, Penman's style of writing makes these historical characters come to life, and it's easy to imagine them as real people. Perhaps though, too many events have been crammed into one story, sometimes years have passed between chapters, and there are so many characters and too many repeated names, for example there are three men, a grandfather, father and son all named Will de Braose.<br />The main storyline is the marriage and love between Llewelyn of Wales and Joanna, daughter of King John - she is given to Llewelyn in marriage when she is only 14 in the hopes of making peace between England and Wales. This novel is first a romance, there is much superfluous sex which has nothing to do with historical events, so much space devoted to falling in love, romance and male/female relations during this period of history.<br />If you love romances and are interested in picking up some history while enjoying a great read this one will be a page-turner for you. However, if you're a connoisseur of historical fiction, the Harlequin romance style could be a turnoff.	2003-03-08

People are dying by the hundreds each week, some trying to escape or smuggle, some engaged in the most heroic acts of their lives, no one can leave and no one can come into the town as though under a siege.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I found this to be the dullest thing I've read since Naipal's \\"A Bend in the River\\". In spite of the horrific events continually taking place in the book the story went on in the same monotone, passionless style from beginning to end. There is much philosophical insight in the behavior of humans in times of exile and stress from continual fear, but I think this author should have stayed away from fiction and stayed with philosophy or perhaps documentaries.<br />This book was like reading an extremely well written composition but it never engaged my emotions.	2003-03-05

I remember reading about this long ago, it is believed that there must have been a volcanic blast that sent a black cloud around the planet and blocked the sun for a period of time.<br />The conclusions reached by the author here are far fetched, in some cases ridiculous. I am an avid reader of history and it is difficult to get a accurate descriptions of events and understand human motivations in the past, the further back you go the more this is true, yet David Keys has a definite answers for everything, solving great mysteries with simple, clear cut answers. He offers the real reason for the collapse of the Roman empire, why Islam expanded to become a major world religion, the true reason for the Nasca lines in South America and even has all the facts about the holy grail and what the whole legend really means. Simplistic explanations with historical events twisted to suit a new version of history.<br />I gave this book 2 stars because it is packed with interesting little details such as descriptions of the Avar civilization and the Turks, the Khazars as a Jewish empire, Javanese \\"Book of Kings\\", the Frankish empire and the Visigoths of Spain even if I believe the author's conclusions to be ridiculous.	2003-02-17

There are three views in this novel which alternate from chapter to chapter, the first is Trujillo himself in the last days of his life, 70 years old and aging fast. We see him as he reminisces about his life & his rise to power, used by the U.S. and trained by the marines originally to be a force against Cuba. Another view is through the eyes of Trujillo's assassins, all previously his henchmen, now working in clandestine groups against the dictator, and their individual stories. The character that begins and ends the novel is purely fictional, Urania, a 49 yr. old woman with a great career in the World Trade Organization and the only female side in this extremely macho novel. Urania has returned to the Dominican Republic after 35 years away to see her father, an old man now who was one of Trujillo's top yes men during his reign of terror.<br />This is book about human motivations and how ordinary people become hypnotized by evil. It is a universal story of the dictator everywhere and a lesson in understanding how it could happen.<br />Another great one from Llosa that defies genre, it is a thriller, an historical novel, a book about politics, and offers stark, penetrating insights into human nature.	2003-02-17

His father rejected him and preferred his brother, his career is a disaster and his wife flaunts her promiscuity in his face and eventually leaves him, taking the children so she can sell them. Following the deaths of his father and his wife, the loss of his job and facing a future as a single parent of two young daughters, Quoyle decides to return with his aunt to Newfoundland, where his paternal family had its roots. It is here in a small town that Quoyle at last finds a place for himself and discovers the true meaning of community.<BR> <BR>As well as being the story of a man's journey toward inner peace, \\"The Shipping News\\" is packed with sometimes really comic descriptions of small town life in more remote areas, tidbits of Newfoundland history, asides about seafaring and the demise of the fishing and sealing industries. The quick, short sentences in the first part of the book reflect Quoyle's crazed life, later as his life becomes more relaxed the story also flows more smoothly.<BR> <BR>I did not see the movie, but the characters on the video box covers are way too good looking to have been characters from \\"The Shipping News\\", the novel. The main character, Quoyle is an obese man with red hair and an unusual chin that juts out like a shelf, his appearance is a part of this story.	2003-02-03

A 40something millionaire widower suddenly marries a young woman with no money, background or breeding and takes her to live at his estate, Manderley. She is haunted by the presence of Rebecca, his first wife, whom she imagines her husband is still in love with.<br />I thought the second half of the book much better than the first, I don't know how I stayed through the first 150 pages, which is the same tiresome whining of the main character over and over. The narrator is so mean spirited, self-centered and just too stupid to be believed, searching & sifting through every conversation, the most minor social encounters, digging and digging and digging to find the insults she believes everyone is directing at her. Perhaps this character is dated and can only be appreciated through 1930's lenses as a sensitive, unworldly, eager to please young woman, but I found it hard to be on her side and couldn't identify with anything she felt. The second part of book seems to deserve the suspense label and really does become a page turner once it leaves the realm of the narrator's inner doubts about her marriage and moves to the mystery of how Rebecca really did die.	2003-01-28

On the way his travelling companion, a young man from France, goes native, and the party of Algonkin sent to escort him abandons him.<BR> <BR>This is a stark, not for the squeamish, view of early Canadian history that was never presented to me in school and really helps me to appreciate the extreme culture shock that occurred when Europeans met aboriginal peoples, in particular here Jesuit missionaries and native North Americans. This novel seems realistic to me because neither side, \\"Normans\\" or \\"Savages\\" as the two groups refer to each other, is presented as good or evil though in this story and time the \\"savages\\" appear to have the advantage because of better adaptation to the environment. Unlike the materially motivated Normans, the natives do not own things or fight over them, sharing everything together, and they are the most caring of parents never physically striking their children, however the cruelty to other tribes including cannibalism and torture, the hard and filthy conditions of their lives, and no mercy for the sick shows another side.<BR> <BR>This book will not be for everyone there are graphic descriptions of sexual acts and horrific scenes describing torture and cannibalism. The language used by the natives is obscene by European standards and their sexual practices immoral beyond belief to the Jesuits, and will be too shocking for some readers. The banter between the natives is not to insult but a friendly joking, personally I found it often hilarious. If  you like stark, no-frills versions of history, you may enjoy this great adventure and first contact story.	2003-01-28

It is strictly food & agriculture covered here, human GE areas are not touched on.  Besides discussing safety & nutrition concerns, chapters cover such topics as control of farming & environmental pollution, patenting genes with a brief history of what's already taken place over the last 15 years, and how the world trade organization is used to force countries to accept these products or to outlaw product labeling.  There is a chapter on 2 journalists in Florida who got into a lot of trouble with Monsanto for attempting to run a television series on a hormone injected into cows to increase milk production.  <br />Some of the information in this book is quite shocking.  The sheer amount of money Monsanto has used to bribe and \\"settle out of court\\" tells me there's got to be something very wrong in what they're doing.  I enjoyed the \\"follow the money\\" advice this book offers - if an \\"expert\\" is saying there's no harm at all any of this try to find out who's paying the salary or funding the grant.  This quote from pg. 106 is unforgettable, \\"We paid $3 billion for these television stations.  We will decide what the news is......\\"<br />Lots of information packed into a small book,  also a guide to organizations and further information.	2003-01-13

Instead of dying in combat as she had believed, Manech was part of a group charged with cowardice & to set an example for other soldiers was condemned to die by being tossed into \\"no man's land\\", the area between the French & German trenches to be killed by the Germans. Mathilde needs to know exactly what happened to Manech, has the money to pursue the truth & does so, and along the way it begins to appear possible that not all 5 men died that night, 1 or maybe even 2 may have survived, but if they did and were found they would now have prison terms to serve.<br />The author has given us an intricate puzzle, Japrisot's style of writing is something new to me there is no one I can think of to compare him to. This is a first rate detective story for the intelligent reader, definitely not a \\"formula\\" mystery, also it is a war novel with grim descriptions of trench life. The prose is blunt, there are no wasted words in the main plot, yet along the way there are so many \\"asides\\", little anecdotes and fascinating glimpses into the private lives and motivations of ordinary people during the war, the book is never dull.<br />Highly recommend this bestseller from France.	2003-01-12

This is the fictional account of Llewelyn, last Welsh prince of Wales, told through the eyes of Samson, Llewelyn's chronicler and closest friend, and Samson's own personal history of mysterious parentage and his love for the enigmatic yet evasive Cristin.<br />The stories of Llewelyn's struggles with his own brothers, especially dark and wild David, his battles with the English (Norman) kings, Henry III then later his son Edward, &amp; the alliance with Simon de Montfort in the English civil war were all familiar to me through the works of Sharon Kay Penman, but I enjoyed &quot;The Brothers of Gwynedd&quot; considerably more.  Penman's style, to use an expression several other reviewers have alluded to, is too much like a Harlequin romance, gushing with characters that belong more in the 20th century than in medieval times.  &quot;The Brothers of Gwynedd&quot; was pure enjoyment to read with great attention to detail and physical descriptions, it seemed to me to have a more authentic medieval feel to it and was as beautiful to read as a fairy tale.<br />This is a long book but a real page turner, one of those you'll wish could keep going forever.  The way the English appropriated the lands of the Welsh, through legal trickery, divide &amp; conquer tactics and outright aggression made me think this was practice for treatment of aboriginal peoples in the newly &quot;discovered&quot; worlds to come.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys medieval fiction or is interested particularly in stories about Wales and it's princes, Simon de Montfort or the Plantagenets.	2003-01-09

It is a story of a modern, educated, well traveled man, fleeing from the horrors of Europe leading up to WWII, to the Americas, who is then transposed into a world where the people still live in the stone age, a hidden city in the jungle and a bubble in time.    <br />Our hero &amp; narrator dreamed when young of becoming a great musician, but has long since sold himself out just for the sake of earning a living. He rarely sees his wife, an actress, because they both have busy schedules that seldom coincide.  One day a fated encounter with a museum curator he knew in his youth leads him to a mission into the jungle to find and bring back the most primitive of musical instruments and to gain anthropological insights on the origins of music.  The musician, who begins the trip with his mistress, ends up on his own cut off from civilization.  In the jungle he at last able to find an inner peace and happiness, he finds a new woman, regains his health &amp; vigor and at last is able to release the musical score he has always known was inside him.  By the time his wife has a plane sent in as a publicity stunt to rescue him, he does not want to return.<br />This novel is deeply philosophical, in the end our musician can no longer find a place in either world, and the message is we can't go back, also theories about early humans which have been arrived at only by studying archaeological artifacts can only be flawed, to quote &quot;New worlds had to be lived before they could be analyzed&quot;.	2003-01-09
US	43849703	R2KEE8OSN1JGLI	1587213974	561623864	A Journey Round a Darker Sun	Books	5	7	9	N	N	Dark Humor	Simon Lowrie is a master at writing erotica for intelligent people, definitely not typical S/M, there are no leather toys, whips, restraints, if you're looking forward to a sexual act on every other page, don't waste your money on this book, you'll be disappointed. Although there are some very hot sexual scenes, most of the D/S takes place on a psychological level using humiliation to control, and involves perspectives from a number of characters, subs & doms both, males & females. Actually, this book is hard to categorize, first and most of all it is a love story told in a style really witty and verbose, also it has the feel of sci-fi or occult fiction, perhaps because the emotional highs in this book are mixed with fear and absolutely removed from the real world. The author's way of comparing people to luminaries and satellites is interesting, some lighter or darker suns with lesser satellites revolving around them who in turn may have satellites of their own.<br />Claire is a breathtakingly beautiful & shapely young woman, good job, young son, many friends, she is popular with both women and men. Only 22, Claire is somewhat of an airhead and a real tease, used to having men worship her, some like Tristan even willing to clean her house and do her shopping in return for just a glimpse of her bare upper thigh. She meets Paul, handsome, rich, well traveled & well dressed, impressive car, Claire is the envy of all her friends for having caught such a man. Privately, Paul is a sexual dominant, demanding and bossy, who introduces her to a thrilling world of discipline and intense sex such as she's never imagined possible. As Claire submits to Paul, perhaps to seek a sense of balance, her domination of Tristan becomes more overt, and he is trained to serve her needs and those of her friend Bev who participates in Tristan's humiliations.<br />A rare find in the Erotica selections.	2003-01-08

Twenty three years later they are reunited in the family home in Kerala, India and begin  the slow process of reconnecting with each other and recovering the memories of what happened.<br />While this novel is set in India and involves the reader in politics I would not recommend such a sad book to \\"get to know\\" India, rather this book is about a dysfunctional family, extreme childhood trauma and the terrible things ordinary human beings can do to each other. The caste system and untouchability is illegal, but is still a strong social influence in the time and place of this story. <br />The author's imagery and style of writing is unusual, she has really captured the innocence of children, I felt I was seeing things through the eyes of a child, a world of colors & larger than life events.  The writing slips fluidly between past and present. <br />I rated this 4 stars because I didn't care for the ending, which seemed rushed to me and lacked a sense of closure.  Like other reviewers here I felt the sexual scene between the twins to be incongruous with the rest of the story, also I was disappointed that Baby Kochamma seemed to get off too lightly.	2003-01-01

The publishing house he works for has trusted his corrections to many of their texts for years, yet one day on impulse he decides to alter a book, \\"The History of the Siege of Lisbon\\", by inserting a word of his own. Where the author writes that the crusaders on their way to the Holy Land stayed to help the Portugese conquer the city of Lisbon and drive out the Muslims, Raimundo inserts the word \\"not\\" saying the crusaders did not help the Portugese changing the whole meaning of what the author had written. His employers are embarrassed when the book makes it to publication and Raimundo is reprimanded, made to write a letter of apology and told he'll be reporting to a new boss, a woman, responsible for checking all his corrections. <br />His new boss and lover to be, Maria Sara convinces him to re-write the history of Lisbon with the word \\"not\\", and as he reimagines the siege of Lisbon, he reimagines his own life and falls in love for the first time. Slow moving, philosophical, this is a romantic & sensual love story, especially for mature readers as well as being great historical fiction. This book was my introduction to Portugese history some years ago.<br />Saramago's style is challenging as usual, single paragraphs that go on for 2 pages, sentences that meander for half a page, whole conversations in a single sentence. Personally I find his way of writing fluid and beautiful, like being right inside the character's head flowing along with his thoughts. He certainly deserved to win the Nobel Prize for literature.	2002-12-23

Of the three books \\"Sugar Street\\" is the most political with the pace moving very quickly, there are time periods of about a year and more between most chapters.<br />  After an intimate look into a Cairo family's life in Book 1 and Kamal's total stagnation in Book 2, caught between feeling and tradition versus rational thought and science, here there is much action in the outer world and larger political life.  The three grandsons grow to maturity in a time when Egypt is breaking free of colonialism.  One is a member of Muslim radical fundamentalist brotherhood, another a communist and the other, well...he too has followed his own path away from family  tradition.<br />  The Cairo trilogy and especially Book 3, Sugar Street can offer a great deal of insight into how attitudes in the Mid-East have been shaped.	2002-12-05
US	43849703	R2IF6FHRZMETUD	038531177X	648196262	Rain of Gold	Books	3	18	37	N	N	Huge Disappointment	This is the first time I disagree so totally with the other reviewers after buying this book based on the outstanding reviews I'd read here. This is the story of several generations of a Mexican family that emigrated to the United States when their village life was destroyed by corporate oppression, and it is the author's own family history, presented as a work of non-fiction. It really seemed like my kind of a book.<br />My problem is with the style of writing, at first I thought I was just reading an extremely bad translation but quickly realized the book was written in English!!... I read through the first 80 pages or so, then scanned every 3rd or 4th paragraph to the end of the book. I'd suggest reading a couple of the sample pages before making a purchase (try page 13). Usually I love detail in historical fiction but this was just too many slow, tedious descriptions of the most mundane events, the word \\"the\\" used way, way too much, every noun with an adjective the favorites being \\"big\\" and \\"little\\". This story would have been better told if half the words in the book were removed.<br />I'd consider giving this book a higher rating if it was listed in the young readers section. It might also be a good choice for who speak English as a second language.	2002-12-04

It appears Kamal has been modeled after Mahfouz himself, and it is often through Kamal's eyes that we view the other characters in this story.<br />If you enjoyed the \\"Palace Walk\\" then \\"Palace of Desire\\" is a must read. As the title implies this book is about love & desire, albeit Islamic style. There are some hilarious scenes such as when the father discovers his mistress is cheating on him with his son or when the brothers meet in a brothel. The sisters are not forgotten in this continuing story, you find out how their married lives have gone.<br />For me, this whole trilogy is a really human look into another culture so different than our own here in North America. People are people with similar urges and feelings, and will find ways to express or control desires through whatever outlets happen to be available.	2002-11-19

Some essays cover such topics as trade, the third world, explanations of GATT & NAFTA, mass layoffs in labor, the food supply & genetically modified organisms. Other writers question whether or not the idea of \\"globalization\\" is even sustainable, one starts to wonder exactly who is behind \\"globalization\\" and benefits from it 'cause the majority sure doesn't. There is a whole section of this book devoted to corporations and they way they function. Wal-Mart & General Electric get whole essays all their own, and richly deserved.<br />Usually books this accurate about the state of the world are just too depressing because the problems seem so entrenched and we're helpless to do anything about them. Not so here, the last section of the book focuses on community & localization and is uplifting.<br />I wish more people would read this book.	2002-10-20

I think this book presents a very realistic picture of marital relations of that time.<br />The ending was somewhat bizarre and made me laugh out loud though I'm not sure it was supposed to be funny. I intend to read the sequel and will probably reread this one again one day, it's a great immigrant/pioneer classic.	2002-10-19

The family's story is woven into greater events in the larger world as the Egyptian nationalistic movement grows in opposition to British rule.<br />The author's style of writing includes rich character descriptions, humor and great attention to detail without ever being tedious. The characters became very real to me and \\"The Palace Walk\\" leaves me very eager to start reading Book 2. The family patriarch is the central character of the first book, a tyrant that has bullied & terrified every member of his family but has a totally different private life away from the home.<br />As well as being a great family saga, this is excellent historical fiction, showing the beginnings of change in the 20th century in this part of the Mid-East.	2002-10-18

The descriptions of the boy, Claude, as he delves deeper and deeper into the world of music held my attention though I am not a musician and cannot read music.  <br />After the discovery of music beginning was over though, I feel the author had nothing else, after that every possible cliche that could be fitted into the story was, the characters were unreal and one-dimensional, everything was just too good to be true.<br />If you're a music lover, this book will probably interest you in spite of the lame plot.	2002-10-18

There were many twists & turns and the ending was a total surprise, the ending actually left me feeling outraged. I will read this again sometime soon to see what little details along the way I missed the first time. <br />The story is of a high-strung spinster who becomes a regular \\"visitor\\" to a women's prison where the conditions are wretched. She meets a woman inmate who was a practicing spiritualist before being imprisoned and is still apparently in touch with the world of spirits.<br />I have also read Sarah Waters' \\"Tipping the Velvet\\" and enjoyed that as well, another Victorian setting, but more \\"bawdy\\", a lesbian coming out story. \\"Affinity\\" is for anyone who enjoys occult thrillers, historical novels or the spiritualist period in Victorian England.	2002-09-05

Originally published in Finnish during the 1940's and set in ancient Egypt around the 14th century BC, it is still a story very relevant to modern times.<br />The main character and narrator is Sinuhe, a man born in Thebes, who has written the story of his life in Egypt and his travels to Syria, Babylon, Crete and the land of the Hittites.  I especially loved the descriptions of Crete and the people who danced with the bulls.  This is much more than an adventure or war novel though, Sinuhe is a deep thinker &amp; searcher for answers about the nature of man and suffers from much inner turmoil.  The greatest part of this turmoil is lived out in the battle between the spiritually motivated pharaoh and the materially minded priests and military.<br />If you are looking for a page turning adventure that is also really great literature don't miss this one.	2002-08-18

A woman shifts between her world and the year 2137 when people have found more environmently friendly ways to live.  There are some violent & disturbing scenes in this but I felt the ending to be positive & uplifting, a reminder that we all need, in our own small ways, to keep \\"fighting the war\\". One comment about some of the other reviews, I am unable to see why this would be taken as a \\"feminist\\" book unless it's because the central character is a woman & the author also.  The message in this book is about the environment first, then human priorities over economic ones.  A thought-provoking view of the future.	2002-05-03
US	43849703	R1WMM4J49SHQ9I	0679751750	419490212	Texaco: A Novel	Books	5	7	9	N	N	great caribbean story	This is the first book I've read by Chamoiseau, it reminded me of Gabriel Marquez's \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\", and is really fine literature, magical & funny, a caribbean tale of the island of Martinique.  It begins in the time of slavery on the sugar plantations and ends in more modern, corporate times.  The book's ending is surprisingly uplifting and postive.  It was hard to decide what rating to give this book - certainly it deserves the highest praise, however I have a feeling this book is much better read in its' original language.  There are footnotes throughout explaining original Creole terms used.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in Caribbean history or \\"universal\\" world literature.	2002-04-23
