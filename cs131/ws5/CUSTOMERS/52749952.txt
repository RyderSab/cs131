The photos are not labeled.  There is an exploded view of sidepull brakes but no photo or diagram of the actual brakes and what they look like put together.<br /><br />There is a photo of different bikes but the labels are all black so sometimes it's hard to identify what the pointer is actually pointing to.  I'm very disappointed because I just wanted to adjust sidepull and cantilever brakes and I can't figure it out from this book.  I really can't tell much from the photos.<br /><br />I am very disappointed.  I thought the revised edition would be better.	2005-03-20

No thanks!<br /><br />Here we go again with saying that eggs are bad for you.  Eggs have so many good things in them, especially the yolks.  My brother gave them up and his steak and then died of pancreatic cancer.<br /><br />Dr Sears says the only fats that are good for you are olive oil, some nuts (macadamia, almonds, and cashews), and avocados.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but eggs are the most natural food in the world.  All kinds of animals eat them and they don't leave the yolks and just eat the whites.  Balderdash!<br /><br />No cheese, milk, etc, no breads, pasta, rice.<br /><br />Not much left is there.<br /><br />I agreed with him on the trans fats (hydrogenated oils) which by the way are in almost every packaged food, and I agreed with him on the omega 6 fats, but otherwise this is just a diet that no one could stay on.  He focuses also on calorie restriction but then says you will never be hungry on his plan.  Yeah, right.<br /><br />I read \\"Sugar Busters\\" and it says the same thing but it focuses on insulin levels which is what is really making Americans fat.	2005-01-29

She even tells you how to hold your hands and fingers, just as if she was sitting beside you.<br />The pictures showing the fiber being held and drafted are great!<br />Since this is an older book I thought I'd list the contents:<br />1.  What the one-handed method will accomplish<br />2.  How to spin with one hand<br />3.  Wool preparation and handling<br />4.  Wheel requirements and limitations<br />5.  The compleat spinner<br />6.  Teaching the one-handed method<br />7.  Projects for soft yarns<br />Appendix:  Tips and Reminders<br />The appendix shows a picture of a &quot;carding board&quot; which is very interesting, as I have never seen one. It says it is a combination picker and carder.  There are too many items in the appendix to list. The book is a jewel just for the pictures alone.	2004-07-08

This was a great help to me. The book covers fiber prep (washing, carding, etc),the parts of the spinning wheel and control over yarn design in handspinning.  She talks about controlling twist and spinning and plying techniques and explains the difference between woolen and worsted yarns.<br />Described in detail, she explains how to make yarns of many kinds, from thick soft ones to fine gossamer.<br />I think this is a great book for both beginner and experienced spinner.	2004-06-08

The close-up photography is great!  You can actually see what they are doing in detail.  I also like it because they use hand tools, so you get to see close-ups of the uses for rabbet planes, spokeshaves, chisels, handsaws.  This is something the other books I have seem to barely cover and I even have some dedicated to hand tools.<br />This is a great book for a beginner!	2004-03-14

It is worth buying just for the disbudding box plan and the folding milk stand plan.  There are many good pictures (black and white) and diagrams.  There is one, for example, that shows you what the horn area should look like after disbudding, how to milk: right and wrong way,  and where to place the weight tape, etc.  Lots of great beginner stuff.<br />The medicine sections are a little outdated, especially on wormer medications, otherwise I would've given it 5 stars.	2004-02-25

Simple as that.  She tells you how to soak grains to get rid of the phytic acid that occurs naturally on grains. She tells how to ferment foods such as sauerkraut.  The whole book is about preparing whole foods so it is mainly a cookbook but does discuss in the beginning of the book how processed foods are killing us.  I find it interesting that one reviewer used the word &quot;vile&quot; in his/her review of this book.  (Seems more like a personal attack to me rather than a review of the book)  What is vile about suggesting buying your own oats or wheat berries and rolling them to make your own breakfast cereal which certainly has more nutrition than those oats that have been shipped from the east or west coast and sprayed with who knows what.  Or grinding your own grain so that you are getting all the nutrients and it is fresh and tasty. She doesn't just tell you to use bulgur or kasha, she tells you HOW to make it at home.  She also tells you to eat organic eggs, butter and milk just as every family used to do, because there is nothing wrong with them when you consume then in their natural state.<br />Every family should own a copy of this book, in my opinion.	2004-02-12

This is a VEGETARIAN book with one recipe for chicken breast.<br />There is no milk, no eggs, no yogurt unless you want to count putting a dollop of yogurt on top of a bean burrito.<br />I researched what \\"whole foods\\" means and this book is NOT it.<br />This is a vegetarian SOY BEANS book.<br />She uses tofu, tempeh, soy milk, tamari, and shoyu ALOT!<br />The book starts out great telling me everything I wanted to hear about changing eating habits and how our diets need to be more whole foods, but then she has a recipe for imitation meat products made from \\"PROCESSED\\" wheat flour gluten.  Please.....<br />And then she recommends you read the labels of the cereals in the store and pick a good one!  There are no good ones!  That's why I bought the book.  Duh!<br />If you want to read about whole foods, read Nourishing Traditions book by Sally Fallon.  I was just looking for kid-friendly recipes that uses grains, etc, and this wasn't it.	2004-02-11

I managed to figure it out, but it wasn't easy.  For instance, she tells you to use a simple, but then doesn't explain the term.<br />I bought the book specifically to make eucalypus oil and a cough syrup, but she really doesn't tell you which method, hot or cold. With the herb Comfrey, she tells you it's a hot infusion and with Marigold she tells you it's a cold infusion.  Being a beginner, I didn't know the difference between an infused oil and an essential oil, which caused alot of frustration.  If she had devoted a couple of sentences under the infused oil section explaining that essential oils are very different and need specialized equipment, it would have saved me some frustration and less disappointment of the book.  I had to find this out by searching on the internet.<br />She is from the United Kingdom and all her recipes are in european measures, so they all have to be converted, and I really had a hard time with that, maybe you won't.  Although she does give you a conversion table for dosages.  I did manage to make a cough syrup but I had doubts about my calculations.  My husband is still alive, by the way.<br />She mentions Cherry bark as one of the remedies for coughs but doesn't have Cherry bark in the visual directory, which means there is no information on it at all.<br />After having said all of that, the descriptions and pictures of each plant is wonderful.  Also, she lists combinations that are good together, like for coughs.  There are 85 herbs listed in the book.  It makes a good reference, but I will definately need another book to supplement it.	2004-01-21

The only ones I am even tempted to try are the couple of oat recipes.  There are a lot more rice recipes than any of the other grains.  The book is very uninspiring.  There are no photos either which might have helped.  I must add that I am not a vegetarian but was looking for ways to prepare grains and get more of them in my daily cooking.  But OAT GROAT SOUP WITH MUSTARD AND THYME, just doesn't sound very appealing to me, for example.<br />She lists buckwheat, millet, oats, quinoa, rice, amaranth, job's tears, teff as the grain categories.  No wheat or corn.	2003-11-23

He does show you that if you blend you can't see the white of the paper, and if you don't you will be able to see white dots.  He uses turps to blend.  That's the gist of the whole 28 pages which contains barely enough text to fill up two pages.	2003-04-29

Also all of her examples look unfinished and unrealistic.  Her trees are the worst, but she does great bark, but she doesn't show you, she just tells you how to do it.<br />I have a lot of respect for Lee Hammond, as I think she is very talented.  I have her drawing horses book and I think it's wonderful.<br />The only thing I like about this book is the tips in the front of the book.<br />Also, I don't consider an artichoke and peppers to be nature.  Also she just shows you the butterfly that's on the front cover, the same as she does the beautiful flower, she doesn't show you how to accomplish them.  She does do one pretty rose with Col-erase pencils.	2003-03-08

Lee Hammond can really draw, and she shows you how.  At the beginning of the book, she goes over the basic shapes, such as circles, spheres, and shows you what each one needs in order to look realistic.  Then she shows you how she draws each feature of a horse.  It's just a great book and I have read many.  I bought one of her colored pencil books after I saw this one and I can't wait.	2003-02-17

Easy access, simple to build, and the rabbit will love it.<br />If you put legs on it, it could be used inside with a litter pan underneath, which is what I plan to do with it.  But I'm also going to make one for outside as well because it is made so that it's easy to move around.<br />The other projects include a wheeled two-seater bench (love it), a picnic table (it's not your regular picnic table design), an arbor with a seat, and an arbor with a swing, a folding screen and a very small tool shed.

I'm new to woodworking.<br />One of the things I like about this book, is the tips.  It doesn't just show you how to put the project together, he gives you tips on making it last.<br />Although I thought the parts on wood selection would be boring, it will help me to select better wood at the lumber yard.<br />The pictures are in color and shows you the steps to complete the project.  These are practical projects so there are not a lot of fancy trim details, which is great for a beginner.  The hardest item is the arbor on the cover page and I think I could do that after looking at the book.  Some of the projects will depend on the size area that you have.  He doesn't give you a list of materials but tells you the size boards he uses or recommends.<br />If you're a beginner this book will give you confidence.	2002-07-20

I have a Bachelor of Science degree, but it is too intellectual for my taste, and I was rather good in English. At first I thought it sounded Shakesperean, and sure enough he quoted from Shakespeare later on. If you want a simple dialog, this is not the book for you. If you loved literature and Shakespeare in college, go for it. To quote one paragraph from the book: &quot;The first step toward knowing who I am meant to be is to know who I am not meant to be.  And it is this person, this false identity, whom I carry around for the greater part of my life under the mistaken conviction that this is I myself, the real me, who has to be repudiated.<br />It just wasn't for me.

The first one I bought in 1986, and I left the book outside and it was rained on.  I reordered one the next day, because I am always carrying it around with me.  The bird  section is what I use the most, but I have identified many trees with it,  turtles, lizards, and I like to reference the small mammal section to find  out about their habits, ie. the raccoon.  Since I use the bird pictures the  most, they are extremely accurate.  I recognized a bird that I had never  seen before but I recognized it because I had seen it in this book. The  book may not be a field guide, which are normally broken into separate  books, but if you want just one good book, then this is it. I can't live  without mine.
