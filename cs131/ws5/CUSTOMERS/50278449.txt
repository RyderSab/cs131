Christopher Banks, the progagonist of Kazuo Ishiguro's When We Were Orphans, is a man with only one mission in life:  he wants to become the world's greatest detective so he can find his kidnapped parents.  But were they really kidnapped?  And did other, relevant events really unfold as Banks relates them?<br />The central question in this highly entertaining and very different sort of story is:  Can Christopher Banks, as a narrator, be trusted?  He can be, insofar as he is truthful when reporting events as he sees them.  Those words are the key to understanding this book, &quot;as he sees them.&quot;  For Banks knows no other way to tell us his story than as he sees it, even though as he sees it may not be quite the way others would see the very same thing.<br />When We Were Orphans, like all of Ishiguro's novels, is complex and multi-layered.  Many of the book's ideas are symbolic and much lies below the surface.  Although extremely entertaining this book is definitely not &quot;beach&quot; reading.  It is as cerebral as anything Ishiguro has previously written and it takes an intelligent and austute reader to catch all of the author's meanings, especially in only one reading.<br />I've read all of Ishiguro's books and all are completely different.  What they do have in common is absolute excellence in every respect.  They are all the master work of a master writer.  None should be missed.	2001-07-29

While the writing itself was first-rate, the character development left much to be desired.  The main character really doesn't change much over the course of the book, and, as such, we don't get to &quot;see&quot; his madness develop.  In fact, he appears to be just as mad when the book begins as when it ends.  Since The Life and Times of a Teaboy is definitely a character-driven novel, as opposed to a plot-driven one, this makes for a very glaring fault.  I felt no emotional connection with the characters; their plight made me feel nothing more than ho-hum.<br />The story is told in a frame, something many readers may not realize until they reach the end of the book, a major disadvantage in my opinion, since those readers will be waiting for something to happen that simply never comes about.<br />It is the first-rate prose that really saves this book.  Collins' writing is even throughout, smooth as silk and it always rings true.  His descriptive powers are also quite excellent and I felt like I was &quot;really there.&quot;<br />Despite the fact that I found this particular book &quot;lukewarm,&quot; I want to emphasize that I won't give up reading Michael Collins.  He's a very talented writer and his view of Ireland is both unique and fascinating.  This simply wasn't my cup of tea.	2001-07-29

I love Joyce's pure stream-of-consciousness writing and the exhilaration and lyricism inherent in his gorgeous prose.<br />In A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, we meet Stephen Dedalus, later to become a central figure in the monumental Ulysses, for the first time and we follow him through his boarding school days, to the university, to his decision to leave Ireland for Paris.  Although it is an excellent idea to read this book before embarking on the much more involved and symbolic Ulysses, those who consider A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man only a prelude to Ulysses are definitely cheating themselves.  This book is a masterpiece of its own accord:  vibrant, exhilarating, luminous, joyous.<br />Even if Joyce had never written Ulysses, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man would be enough to assure his place in history as one of the world's greatest authors.  Don't miss this prize!	2001-07-29

It's the wonderful, multi-layered story of a poor orphan who falls in love with a man of the British upper class.<br />Jane Eyre is a fully-fleshed out character who is, in many ways, more modern than her nineteenth century counterparts.  She is definitely a character to &quot;fall in love with&quot; and one that is truly unforgettable.<br />Although some of the events in Jane Eyre are more than a little far-fetched, the plot is so enjoyable we can easily forgive Bronte a few minor faults.  The pages simply fly by as we want to learn more about Jane and Mr. Rochester and their ultimate fate, both together and apart.<br />Jane Eyre is a classic in every sense of the word and extraordinarily enjoyable as well.	2001-07-29

I did manage to finish, but it was a real trial.  <br />I thought it very believable that someone deeply in love would write passionate letters and then never mail them, if not mailing them was for the best during politically turbulent times.  What I didn't buy was the fact that had the letters been real, the writer of those letters was telling the recipient things both of them already knew, things that were for the reader's benefit only.  Shame on the author for making this very basic literary mistake!<br />I found the writing in the book to be over-the-top in a dreadful (there is no other word to use) sort of way.  It turned what was supposed to be several tragedies, actually, into an almost-comedy.  Only the dark subject matter kept me from laughing out loud.<br />I could write more, but let's just say this is one of the worst books I have ever read and let it go at that.	2001-07-25

Although the author's stream-of-consciousnenss style may take a little getting used to for readers of more conventional books, it is as smooth as silk and never jarring.  Hulme's manipulation of the third person subjective is masterful and we really come to know each of the three protagonists and feel their deep and continuous pain.  Although the subject matter portrayed in The Bone People is dark and often horrendous, the writing itself is lyrical, a testament to Hulme's power as a poet.  But make no mistake, The Bone People is a narrative, a superb one, and not a prose poem.<br />For me, The Bone People is a meditation about the destructive effects of closing oneself to others, of retreating and withdrawing so far into oneself that one is no longer capable of real communication and communion with others.<br />Each of the three protagonists, because of excessive pain, pain that goes beyond any words, has built and retreated into what he or she hopes will be a protective shell but finds instead a nightmare world, one that leads each to the very brink of death.<br />I have heard some people say they believe the ending to be trite or &quot;tacked on.&quot;  I found the ending absolutely perfect, and given each character's &quot;trial by fire,&quot; I don't know how Hulme could have written the ending any differently and still maintained the integrity of her book.<br />I am sure there are many Maori legends, myths and references in The Bone People that I missed as I know little about this fascinating culture.  But do not let a lack of Maori knowledge stop you from reading this superb book.  It is, above all else, a wonderfully insightful character study that is rich, complex and filled with love and pain beyond measure.<br />I enjoy reading almost any book I choose to delve into, but few have left me with a feeling of awe.  The Bone People is one that did.  I am sure I will remember it for a long, long time to come.  Indeed, I may never forget it.  In short, I simply cannot praise it highly enough.	2001-06-05

Kitchen Confidential, while very interesting, seemed a bit &quot;thin.&quot;  Instead of giving us details, Bourdain simply glosses over.  Don't get me wrong, this is very interesting and entertaining glossing over and Kitchen Confidential is a lot of fun to read.  <br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for light, escapist fare.  Although I found Kitchen Confidential to be less than I expected, I did enjoy Bourdain's writing style so much that I bought his novel, Bone in the Throat.  I'll read it when I feel like laughing and not thinking very deeply.<br />As for Kitchen Confidential, I would recommend it only for those looking for something light and only for those who truly love food.	2001-05-20

In it, he creates a unique and unforgettable heroine, Isabel Archer, and then proceeds to let her make all the mistakes the young are capable of making.  In fact, Isabel is so sure of herself that, at times, I found it difficult to have much sympathy for her poor choices.  But one thing I never felt for Isabel Archer was indifference, all to James' credit.<br />The Portrait of a Lady is truly 19th Century literature at its finest, but that means it also contains elements that might be distracting for the modern reader.  There are lengthy descriptions, the pace is rather slow and James never lets us forget we are reading a book.  He makes liberal use of phrases such as &quot;our heroine,&quot; and &quot;Dear Reader.&quot;  While all of this was expected in the 19th Century, some readers today might find it annoying.<br />Those who don't however, will find themselves entranced by a beautiful story of love and loss, unforgettable characters (there are many more besides Isabel, most notably the enigmatic Madame Merle) and gorgeous description, all rendered in James' flawless prose.<br />Anyone who loves classics or who wants a truly well-rounded background in literature cannot afford to pass this up.	2001-05-20

It's a ghost story, it's horror, it's suspense, but what set it head and shoulders above most ghost/horror/suspense stories is the fact that it's strictly psychological.<br />A young governess secures a position at what appears to be a lovely English manor house and she soon discovers that nothing is what is seems and things are definitely not as they should be.<br />James has a highly stylized way of writing and he loved using long, convoluted sentences, even when saying something quite simple.  Some readers might find this a litle jarring, but for me it only adds to the atmosphere of the book.<br />Over the years there has been much speculation about the meaning of this story, especially the enigmatic ending.  I know what I think, but I won't give anything away here.  Read The Turn of the Screw yourself and be prepared for a scary evening of surprises and perhaps even a sleepless night.	2001-05-20

Without readers, Calvino asks, where would storytellers be?<br />Anyone looking for a conventional plot and character development won't find it here, but Calvino does manage to entertain as he teaches.  If on a winter's night a traveler is filed with puzzles and surprises, almost on every page, right to the very last sentence.<br />My only criticism of the book, and this is slight, is that, although not long, it seemed to be a little too long for an unconventional work.  I would have enjoyed the book more had Calvino not written quite as much.<br />As I said, this is not for readers looking for a conventional storyline and characters.  But if you're looking for something a little different, something very creative and something fun, If on a winter's night a traveler would be hard to beat.<br />Definitely a five star treat.	2001-05-20
US	50278449	RHL34D51EKL5A	0452280621	675572194	Beloved	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Beautiful	Beloved is a truly beautiful book.  Part history, part ghost story, Beloved is based on an actual incident and concerns themes of love and family and the legacy of slavery in the United States.  The characters are all highly symbolic and it is no accident that no one's memory extends further back than the beginning of slavery in America.<br />Toni Morrison wrote Beloved in an experimental style which she began in The Bluest Eye.  This narrative style is deliberately filled with holes and spaces and calls for much reader participation, something I think caused many readers to dislike this masterful book.<br />The film version of Beloved was a box office failure.  Those who didn't like this book point to that to justify, in part, their feelings.  To me, the failure of the film simply points out that Beloved is a uniquely literary work and one that cannot be translated to another medium.  Fiction has come a long way from the traditional and Toni Morrison is one of the world's best writers, possibly the greatest living female writer.<br />Approach Beloved with an open, willing mind and you certainly won't be disappointed.	2001-05-20

There is no doubt that Madam Bovary is a great and influential novel.  As a native French-speaker, I can also say this is a terrific translation.  But the character of Emma Bovary is so crass, so cold, so unlovable that I can't help but get a sour taste in my mouth every time I read the book--in French or in English.<br />Had Flaubert endowed the selfish Emma with a little love for others (her husband and her daughter, most notably), I would have felt sympathy for her and for her plight.  I realize that Emma was no doubt a woman who was &quot;trapped&quot; but even trapped women find the time to love their own child.  As it is, Emma Bovary is a self-centered, conniving fool and I pity anyone who comes near her.<br />All that aside, Flaubert certainly did create a wonderfully-written book, an engrossing plot, an innovative piece of work and one filled with style (whether he wanted to do so or not).  So why only three stars?  I deducted two stars because of Emma's lack of humanity.  I simply wanted to slap the woman and say, &quot;Grow up!&quot;	2001-04-19

It has its flaws, to be sure, but they are minor ones.  One of the characters is truly reprehensible, but his appearances are so few and far between that I think his horrid behavior can easily be overlooked.<br />What bothered me more, with this book, were the female characters.  One of them seems quite true to life but the other one did not.  She seemed wooden, a cardboard cutout.  Barnes is a terrific writer, but in my opinion, he has yet to create a believable, good, female character.  <br />The writing in this book is really first rate British humor (I expect it may be too British for some).  It is an escapist book but I don't think that should lessen its importance.  After all, don't we all need to escape now and then?<br />If you want to laugh and have a little fun, if you want to forget your troubles for awhile, then try Before She Met Me.  It might do you a world of good.  It did me.	2001-04-19

Unfortunately, the book's enigmatic qualities soon fizzle as the plot veers off course only to finish with many dangling threads.  I do not mind dangling threads if the plot supports and calls for them, but Pilgrim seemed to need a little more.  We simply don't know what Findley is trying to tell us.<br />Findley's writing, as always, is truly first rate and the book is enjoyable to read for this reason alone.  While I found it difficult to identify with the character of Pilgrim (this could have been deliberate on Findley's part, I know, given the book's nature), I did enjoy the &quot;intimate&quot; look at Carl Jung and his long-suffering and loyal wife, Emma.  How true this account of the Jung's is is not really important.  This is fiction, not fact.  What is important is that Findley gives us an engrossing portrait of a marriage that could stand a little work, especially on the part of Jung.<br />Pilgrim is a good book and one that I don't think anyone will regret reading.  It is definitely not Findley's best and contains some plot holes that I think would have been better had they been filled.	2001-04-17

Banana Yoshimoto, in a work of what may be genius, manages to capture profound and deep emotions in a beautiful but unadorned writing style.<br />The characters are real.  I mean really real.  You won't find any cardboard cutouts here.  And you won't find glamour girls or jet-setters.  These are people we can really relate to, from the bottom of our heart.  I came to love and cherish these characters and to really, really care what happened to them and their lives.<br />There isn't a fast-paced plot but the subjects explored by the author touch you so deeply that you would gladly trade her insight for plot any day.  I think it would take a cold and cynical heart not to love Kitchen and its characters.  I cherish them and I cherish this book.  I know I'll be reading it again and again, for just as the main character is comforted by a kitchen, I am comforted by Kitchen.  <br />Warm, wise and wonderful.  If these elements appeal to you, then you will no doubt love Kitchen as much as I do.	2001-03-30

Four different people who saw the very same event in four completely different ways.  Which story is the truthful one?  Can absolute truth even be discerned?  Fascinating!<br />Pears' book is brilliantly and meticulously researched and for that reason and that reason alone, I awarded it three stars.  Unfortunately, his brilliant idea falls short in the second story.  Instead of four people giving us four versions of &quot;the truth,&quot; we have four very monotonous stories that rehash the very same thing.  In addition, the &quot;voices&quot; of each of the four characters are very much the same, making it seem as though one person is doing all the narrating when it should have been four.<br />The plot that begins with such an intriguing premise soon dissipates into what I can only term a &quot;cop out&quot; and the ending is not to be believed!  I do not mean that in a good sense, but in a very bad one!  My only reaction (besides resentment) at the ending of this book was, &quot;Good grief!&quot;  I am aware that fiction is often implausible but it should not be so far out as to insult the reader and this is what this book does.  At least for me.<br />The book is overly long.  This story could (and should) have been told in half the space Pears took to tell it.  At least that would have cut down on the boredom a bit.  Only sheer determination and willpower allowed me to finish this book.<br />Pears has written some really first rate art history mysteries.  They are fun and enjoyable to read, but in my opinion, he failed miserable with An Instance of the Fingerpost.	2001-03-29

Ghost Story is a book about the real horrors of life, those that we create ourselves, those that originate, not from without but from within.<br />Straub is a masterful writer and his prose is terrific throughout.  I really got a sense of &quot;place&quot; with this book, something that doesn't always happen.  The characters are well-drawn as well and I came to care about each and every one of them and I took a great interest in their own perception of events.<br />Even if the horror or mystery genre is not your cup of tea, please do not be put off by Ghost Story.  This is a real classic of fiction, one that actually defies classification.<br />While Ghost Story didn't actually scare me (I think we have all been too bombarded with horror for that), it did give me shivers and kept me turning pages well into the night.  I think fifty or even one hundred years from now, people will still be reading Ghost Story and telling each other what a great book it is.	2001-03-29

Likewise, it is far too easy to put down the Christmas season as too commercial. And it is far too easy to dismiss a seasonal gem such as The Polar Express as simplistic and sentimental. But this tale is one of belief, of keeping something which is childlike, not childish, and that just doesn't grow old.<br />The narrator, a boy, lies awake listening for the sound of the bells on Santa's sleigh, a sound a friend who doesn't believe in Santa Claus says that he won't hear. Indeed, he does not, but what he does hear is even more wonderful and remarkable. He hears the hiss of steam and the squeak of metal, and when he looks out the window, he sees a train outside his house. It is the Polar Express, heading for the North Pole.<br />Once aboard, he finds that it is full of children, all in their nightclothes. They sing Christmas carols, drink cocoa and eat candies as the train races northward. Finally, they arrive at the North Pole, and the narrator is selected to receive the first gift of Christmas. He asks for, and receives from Santa Claus himself, a silver bell from the sleigh.<br />Although the boy loses the bell on the way home, kindly Santa returns it to him, and the boy discovers that the bell has a remarkable quality. Only those who still believe in the wonder of Santa and the spirit of Christmas can hear the bell. His friends and his sister eventually cannot hear the bell, but even when he grows up &quot;the bell still rings for [him] as it does for all who truly believe.&quot;<br />The story is accompanied by beautiful pictures that capture the nighttime journey. The author employs somber tones in most of his scenes, speckled with snow and highlighted with starlight and the glowing lights of the train. He captures the cold and mystery of the night, contrasting it with the warm interior scenes.<br />Every child should own this book. It is a magical story that they can appreciate for the rest of their lives.s.	2000-10-18

When Kerry sees a beautiful woman leaving Dr. Smith's office, she can't help feeling that she's seen the woman before. On the next visit to Dr. Smith, when Kerry sees yet another woman who looks strikingly similar to the first, she suddenly realizes why the face seems so familiar: it's the face of Suzanne Reardon, Dr. Smith's daughter, killed over ten years ago in the highly publicized Sweetheart Murder Case. Suzanne's husband, Skip, was convicted of the killing largely on the basis of Smith's testimony but has continued to proclaim his innocence.<br />Kerry's boss, Frank Green, made his reputation by successfully prosecuting the Reardon case. Now Green is preparing to run for governor, and Kerry herself is about to be nominated for a judgeship thanks to the recommendation of long-time state senator Jonathan Hoover, Kerry's friend and mentor. Hoover warns Kerry that looking into the Reardon case now could be a political embarrassment for all of them.<br />And then there's Bob Kinellen, Kerry's ex-husband, who's defending mobster Jimmy Weeks at his trial for tax evasion. Weeks was rumored to be having an affair with Suzanne Reardon around the time she was killed. When Kerry begins receiving threats of harm to Robin, she knows somebody has a good reason to keep her from resurrecting the Sweetheart Murder Case.<br />Another fantastic book from Mary Higgins Clark!

In The Legend of Bouvines Georges Duby writes about this battle, and the legends which sprang from it, from a clear, unbiased perspective. <br />After describing the background to the battle, he presents an edited version of a contemporary account (that of William the Breton). This is followed by a general commentary on the ideology of peace, war, and battle in the twelfth century. Duby then analyses the evolution of the legends that sprang from Bouvines - in the centuries following the battle and, after its 18th century revival, in modern French historiography. Some of the sources for the battle are included as an appendix. <br />The Legend of Bouvines has a rare gem. Duby writes in the present tense, with a polished but effective prose, and brings alive both the ideals and the realities of warfare in high medieval France.	2000-10-05

Not that I consider myself a dummy, but I have found this book series to offer good advice on the basics on whatever you want to do. This guide is no exception. My only complaint would be discussions regarding equipment. I feel that too much attention was given to this necessary but individual segment of cooking. Cooks need tools, but good tools don't make good cooks. <br />But the book still has many merits and certainly makes for fun reading.	2000-09-30

Pandas are very rare and very beautiful creatures (but they aren't really  bears, and if anyone is a bear expert, it is me!). This book tells the  adventures of Basi and Yuan Yuan during their visit to the San Diego Zoo.  The best part of the book are the many pages of color photos.

Although I did not see the television documentary on these two little  darlings, I nevertheless loved the book. Although they are now big bears,  the story of little Klondike and Snow's early years is interesting,  educational and touching. Abandoned by their mother as cubs, the two bears  were raised by humans. This book clearly illustrates the love and devotion  of the Denver Zoo towards the cubs' care and development. Klondike and Snow  are now thriving at Sea World's Wild Arctic exhibit, were they have plenty  of living space and attention! <br />This book is wonderful for any animal  lover and people interested in animal/human interaction.	2000-09-12

It is a story of an adventure and devotion, throwing caution to the  wind and seeking the perfect object of one's love--barbecue. <br />Those  living in or thinking of visiting Texas will certainly find this guide  useful.

The recipes  comprise an excellent collection of very low fat recipes aimed specifically  for holidays. As many vegetarians know, it is extremely difficult to find  no meat recipes for special occasions. However, these recipes are not only  for vegetarians, but also for health conscious celebrants. <br />My only  complaint would be that most non-vegetarians (such as myself) will find the  recipes rather skimpy and lacking the hearty flavors of holidays. I  personally would rather indulge during holidays and watch my health on the  other days!<br />Whether it be used for holiday ideas or everyday meals, this  book certainly has merit for certain cooks.	2000-08-29

I've read all the arguments about the author's many failed marriages, but this is a book review and not an author review. Grey does a god job in pointing out the basic differences between men and women and gives us a  good overview of the needs of each. There really are no &quot;weak  spots&quot; and it was interesting reading from beginning to end. Now I  know why I have so much trouble with men, But I still don't understand  them.	2000-06-26

The descriptions are both colorful and perfect. The characters are especially well drawn and each is unique and memorable. Telling the story  from the viewpoint of each of the women is a masterful touch and the author  makes wonderful use of this device. I enjoyed reading about African  politics and thought Kingsolver did a good job of weaving them into the  story. <br />The only reason I deducted a star was because the story seemed to  go on for too long. Cutting back fifty to seventy-five pages would have  made this book a perfect five-star read.	2000-06-26

The author did a good job of setting everything up and her writing throughout was fluid and  fun to read. The ending, however, left a lot to be desired. Instead of the  big showdown the author led us to expect, the story just fizzled. The best  parts of Chocolat was all the wonderful descriptions on the chocolates.  They really made me hungry! Even though the ending was a bit of a letdown,  this is still an interesting book, one that was lighthearted and fun to  read.	2000-06-23

A dramatic beginning and tense, suspenseful action fill the book until its climatic  end. <br />The characters are well developed and very realistic. The story  always focuses on the main plot, and never diverts itself from the action  at hand. I will certainly remember this book for a very long time!	2000-06-17

Compelled to search for the violinist the next evening, they finally meet at an almost  deserted restaurant garden. It is there that the violinist, Jenö, tells a  story of friendship and betrayal. <br />Jenö's story captures readers  imagination all the way to the mysterious end. The atmosphere of early 20th  century Europe is perfectly captured along with the rise of the Third  Reich. Although it leaves many unanswered questions, the book is very  satisfying and memorable.	2000-06-16

As the reader begins to travel down the road of memories, they are transported to a world and life long ago. As a  housewife in post World War II Japan, Etsuko leads a content and stabile  life. Until she meets Suchiko and her enigmatic daughter. As their  friendship progresses, readers become wrapped up in a cocoon of mysteries  and unanswered question. <br />The memories take on an almost dreamlike  quality and the reader is present with bits of the puzzle slowly but  steadily. The end is a surprise and does leave room for speculation, which  some readers may not like. However, this is truly a memorable book and one  of the best debut novels I have ever read.	2000-06-16

The author has done an excellent job of detailing the rituals and practices of the geisha, as well  as the world in which they were forced to compete. <br />The characters are  engaging and true to life. Sayuri, the main character, is a mostly  believable heroine. Her ambitions were not always rational but this creates  a more imperfect and human character.<br />My main criticism of this book is  the decline of story tension after the World War II section. And Sayuri  does not attain her goal herself; how it is obtained is silly and flat.  <br />Nevertheless, this book is still an excellent choice for anyone  interested in this almost forgotten Japanese culture.	2000-05-29

The story was dull and the action slow. The characters were also extremely artificial. The end was also very easy to guess. <br />Most disturbing to me was that the author,  through a careless mistake, reveals one on the big secrets of the book near  the beginning, leaving the reader extremely confused until the secret is  &quot;revealed&quot; at the end. That certainly killed the suspense for me.  That mistake was uncalled for and just shows the low quality of writing and  editing in this book. It is certainly not worth anyone's money.	2000-05-25

The bread recipes are also excellent. <br />For anyone  with an interest in French cuisine, this book is an absolute must.	2000-05-24

Kathryn Harrison has done a beautiful job in capturing the essence of the spirit of the times in the lyrically beautiful prose of Poison.  She is a word weaver, a poet as much as a novelist, and indeed, Poison reads much  like a gorgeous poem I never wanted to end.  The way Harrison weaves the  two stories together is nothing short of magic.  Poison is, indeed, a novel  that will capture both the imagination and the heart.	2000-05-04

In the same lyrically beautiful words that read more like a poem than prose, Harrison magically weaves a tale of a daughter who is both forgotten and clung to.   Although melodrama abounds in this book, Harrison has it all well under  control and the characterizations and pacing are just perfect.  This is a  book that will haunt you, years after you finish the last word.	2000-05-04

As an intermediate screenwriting student and accomplished actress, I read all the other books on  screenwriting available and never really found what I was truly looking for  until I began to study Syd's books.  I recommend them highly to anyone,  beginner or advanced alike, who is interested in becoming a screenwriter or  just furthering his craft.  The new, revised edition is even better than  the original, if possible.  Syd really shows you how you can adapt his  wealth of knowledge to your own script and make it all it can be.  Thanks,  Syd!	2000-04-08

In other words, I did not like all the book's examples drawn from already-produced movies.  I also found the material in this book well-suited only to someone completely new to the business of screenwriting. But this book's material would help someone to understand how the movie-examples were improved.  So I think the content is just okay, but not great.	2000-03-29

I have to disagree with the other reviewers who said she was so awful.  Everyone just used her for their own purposes, including that wretch of a husband of hers, Andy.  She should be  glad to be rid of a man like him--having an affair behind her back with  someone she employed!  I think Oppenheimer did a good job with the book--it  was well-researched, and, unlike previous reviewers, I thought a lot of  people (e.g., Martha's sister, Laura and the actor, Brian Dennehey), had a  lot of very good things to say about Martha.  Personally, I find her books  extremely worthwhile and will keep purchasing every one she publishes.	2000-01-17
