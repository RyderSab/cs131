Lahiri is simply brilliant.  To write such beautiful work, almost poetic, and have interesting stories that start from the nature of a person.  Her descriptions provide texture to every object especially food!  There is somehow inherent sadness in nearly every story and it almost depresses me every time.  But it really is one of the most beautifully written books I've read.	2004-06-13

To see the repercussions of the coup, just pick up today's paper and read about the happenings occurring nearly everywhere in the world.  Even if you understate the impact of the coup, the book is a must-read for its story and all the machinations involved.	2004-06-08

I did enjoy it mostly, the highlights being the passages about George getting to ready to be the QB in the scrimmage.  I think if he had actually played in the Cleveland game, then this book would end on a great note.  There were interesting stories and nuggets of info about football and the preparation and how the players perform under pressure, but most of it was not too surprising.  Maybe the fact that writing about football doesn't have quite the lyrical aspect as baseball does hurts the book.  It was a good read, but it was missing something.	2004-03-26

Not being a soccer fan, it was cool to read about the author's passion of soccer.  Well Mcginniss is close to insane.  The first half of the book is great when you read about the soccer team, the tiny town of Castel di Sangro, and their amazing achievement of playing these great Italian teams.  But the story gives you a dose of reality - deaths, corruption, deceit, disloyalty, stubbornness, etc.  The fact is that when I read about cheap and unforgiving the team management and ownership, I was almost prepared for the shocking ending.  I'm glad the author put this part in because the truth is there are no fairy tale endings.  The weakness in the book is there was no examination of what makes soccer fans so nutty and passionate.  He had this perfect place where he could talk to every single fan if he wanted to and find out what is it about this game?  Still a recommended read.	2004-03-20

I have never read any of Jenkins's columns but I was intrigued by the premise of the book when listening to him on a radio interview.  Jenkins sounds like the guy I want to be, but without the guts.  He attacks life....he attacks nature, but he's turned his sojourns all over the world into a sort of an art form.<br />The book is a collection of adventures and I like the fact that he threw in other different stories in there including an encounter with a thief and parallel storytelling over a number of years.<br />I realized that it wasn't actually the adventures I enjoyed, but rather the memories and experiences he had while undertaking these adventures. Just like the cliche: &quot;It's not about the destination, but about the journey.&quot;<br />The pace of the book is good and it does not get repetitive so please check this one out.	2003-04-04

Never mind the objectives of the American government or the means they used to find Aidid, these Delta and Ranger soldiers risked their lives for America.<br />Bowden jumps from the situation of one soldier to another constantly while never leaving the big picture throughout the story.  Reading this book was like watching an action movie - the intensity really came across.<br />I would have liked to learn more from Bowden about the question of U.S.'s presence in Somalia, but that belongs in another book discussing their international role.	2003-03-09

I think Feinstein did a fair job of retelling the story.  He drew good quotes from the participants and witnesses and others.  However, Feinstein constantly repeats himself.  He could repeat one statement about 4 or 5 times.  I thought it was quite annoying.  Even the first chapter of the book was repeated throughout the story again and again.  Though it was a shocking and sad story, maybe Feinstein realized he could not find any interesting subtexts although I agree with another reviewer that Feinstein should have talked to the coaches and others about why Washington cannot find work these days in the NBA.  Not one of Feinstein's better efforts.	2003-01-03

I did not enjoy it as much as I hoped because it's not a true detective / murder mystery type.  Spade hardly did investigating and instead seemed to stumble into clue after clue and run into a key character here and there.  The writing style emphasized the characters and their expressions more than the plot.  It was not quite what I expected.  The writing was so good that it was very easy to imagine every scene and every character nuance, but it cannot be classified as a murder mystery.	2002-04-09

One minute, you're reading about the events from the mother's perspective where she talks about Vinnie, then suddenly you're reading about Vinnie's thoughts of his family, and so on.  I loved The Godfather and now this is a favorite as well.  This story is not just about family members prevailing through tragedy after tragedy, but it's also each member finding a role in life and why they must fulfill the role.  It's an inspiring tale of a family in the Depression era.	2002-04-09

I've only recently become a fan of REM and I picked up this book to read about the band's origins and early history.  Fletcher did a great job with describing the early music scene in Georgia and detailing the birth of REM.  He never asked you to learn too many details and tidbits about the comprehensive world of music and never went too deep into the motivations of the songwriting.  But the band does give input here and there and the rise and success of the band is very well-documented.  I'd like to read Fletcher's take on the 2nd decade of REM.  He did that good of a job in this book.	2002-03-07

The characters are likable, the story is engrossing, and it's written by Grisham which means it's easy and poetic to read.  The main character is the most likable because he is so innocent and yet so mature.  Some of his actions incited some great laugh-out loud moments.  The story is about the life of cotton farming in the Midwest in the early 50s, and it's not romantic.  But the characters are and that is what makes this story so endearing.	2002-03-04

I went into this book without any true knowledge of the conflict in the Middle East and what made Jerusalem such a holy but yet disputed city.  The book did answer my questions and gave me lots of the key information about the birth of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.  The author focuses on using architecture and history of the major monuments of the religions as her device to tell the story of Jerusalem.<br />I went into reading the book as a textbook so I got the significant dates and times out of it, but the city was controlled by a different group seeminly every 10 years so the book gets tedious and dry most of the time.<br />As an introductory look at the history of Jerusalem and more generally the battle between the Jews and the Arabs, A History Of Jerusalem is a good start.	2002-02-21

It was fun to read everything that happens to Thorby because he's seeing everything for the first time.  There are basically 3 segments to the story.  I think the best story was his time on Sisu, but you learn about the culture of the Family.  But the ending was not so great.  Believe it or not, the last 50 pages were about .... bureaucracy!  That ruined a sense of mystique about the book, but it had a point since Thorby experienced life in different cultures.  It was still weird, though.	2002-01-24

Reading it from the &quot;victim's&quot; perspective adds a real feeling of fright and nervousness to the events that are happening.  As a reader, you never know what's going to happen next.

Here, Cramer writes a book that breaks the shiny surface of Dimaggio's life and he does some real investigating.  Really this book does not totally stain Dimaggio's name, but it does lessen his stardom by a notch.  We learn things about Dimaggio that are surprising, but not shocking.  This is a very entertaining book to read.  I was only bored with the last 100 or so pages where he talks about Dimaggio's merchandising and signing deals where only he wins.  If you want to learn about who the Yankee Clipper really was, this is the book for you.	2001-10-29

He mainly talked about the Milwaukee Brewers significantly more than the Baltimore Orioles.  2. He talked way too much about the management issue of the Brewers (how they were relocated, payroll). Other than that it's a fun book to read but there needed to be more baseball discussion rather than discussion of topics that isn't really baseball at the core.	2001-10-11

Early on, I was hoping there was something more to the story than just lost boys on an island by themselves.  Once I realized that the basic story was just boys fending for themselves, I enjoyed it more.  It's not an easy book to get through because we can't get too close to the main characters Ralph and Jack.  We know by the end, Jack and his &quot;hunters&quot; have gone too far, but somehow I never felt the panic or emotion that Ralph and Piggy probably did.  But the story is fascinating just on the merits of human nature.  Everyone should take that away after finishing this story - people can be broken down into basic personality elements.	2001-10-06

Plenty of quirky stories to read in this novel, but I am not sure of what the author is trying to say.  It is apparent that the inhabitants of Lake Wobegon are interesting and eccentric characters shaped by religion and appears near-insane to the kids.  Keillor writes solely about this town and its stories and includes himself in some as well. According to the ending, I can see religion plays a big part in their lives, but I don't know specifically what part.  The author reveals just enough, but not satisfactorily enough for a meatier story.	2001-08-31

But if I did not understand it, then I cannot recommend it.  One major positive aspect was the beautiful imagery depicted by Toni Morrison - very descriptive style of writing.  But when it came to writing about the characters, specifically Sula, I did not understand what Morrison was trying to say.  Sula was a very mysterious enigmatic woman who lived her life like no one else and dared to do things she wanted to do.  She did not put herself through the experience of childbirth or stay at home tending to others like her childhood friend and all other women mentioned in &quot;Sula&quot;.  I didn't know what to think after the ending.  What was the point?	2001-08-07

I was a little apprehensive of reading a book that had a rabbit on the cover, but I'm so glad I read it.  Not only it is a adventure, Adams brings in elements of teamwork, hierarchy of leadership, and problem-solving during crisis.  It's almost like a business seminar.  I fell in love with the rabbits that we followed from page 1 and I felt like I was on the roller coaster with them.  It's a simply heartwarming adventure of rabbits who have to leave home and deal with life in the real world.  It does not matter if these are rabbits or turtles or humans, the story applies to everyone.	2001-08-07

This is a very detailed book and sometimes you're reading more about the landscape and destruction than the characters or the Martians.  But it is almost like a real life perspective seen through the eyes of a person trying to flee the Martians.

I loved the way the story begins where we do not know any names of the characters but the plot grips us early.  We are given great descriptions of all aspects of time travel and the natural reactions of people in such a situation.  The adventure itself felt more as a trip through a museum rather than being 800,000 years in the future.  Wells touched just enough of the science fiction area to intrigue us and then zooms back into the story.  The book is not too long which is another plus.	2001-08-07

I liked the fact that Feinstein talked to golfers of different levels - champion golfers who attempt to regain the glory, golfers who still need to make their mark at the majors, and golfers who are attempting to elevate themselves from amateurs to professionals. He chose a good group to talk to and does a good job detailing the struggles plus the situations of the PGA front office.<br />This book is way too long - I know he covered basically one whole year and some, but he put in too many golfers and their family type stories.  He also weaves in and out from golfer to golfer.  For instance, the best part was at the beginning - the Davis Love III story at Ryder Cup, but Feinstein did not write about Love until midway through the book and I did not care for it as much because it was so long ago.  Feinstein does not try to grab your attention with details - he just wants to cover every story like he was writing an everyday column.<br />He could have cut one or two golfers from the story.  Still an enjoyable read.	2001-07-14

Feinstein gives you a great sense of the effort and emotions that takes place throughout one season.  He does so well at writing about the daily grind that the coaches and players go through.<br />I thought it was odd that we didn't get to hear from Feinstein as a writer following Knight around, but rather he was like an ethereal spirit floating around Knight.  That was a good move because the core of the book is Bob Knight.  He is such an enigma.  In general I like the guy.  He sounds like a great teacher and he has the results to prove it.  He's also a caring guy who does not hesitate to do things for his friends and fans of Indiana basketball.  But he's the kind of the guy that has to have everything go his own way.  He needs control and Feinstein explains how he loses control from time to time.  Some of it is purely mental play, but most is his emotions taking over.<br />I want to see him succeed but he still has to work on avoiding dumb mistakes.  He also has to realize that as long as he antagonizes the media, he will never be portrayed in a positive light even for a moment.<br />Great book - sports fans and basketball fans must read this.	2001-06-22

This was such a different take on the character of Dracula himself.  I really did not know much about this version of Dracula.  I guess I was accustomed to the Dracula we see represented in movies, but this book presented a different light of him.  Positives include the great description of how Dracula &quot;influenced&quot; his victims.  How people were affected by what was happening to their friends and family.  I enjoyed reading how the Professor and the Doctor tried to analyze Dracula and all the incidents.<br />Two things I thought were minor negatives:  One is that it was written in a journal format - several characters wrote journal entries to present the story and it was exciting to read them.  But how can you expect people, after they've been through harrowing experiences and seeing their loved ones harmed, write every darn detail of that day into a journal?  Maybe they were all very sharp and had great memories, but I could not expect them to capture every minute detail.  I think Stoker should have included bits of story from a narrative perspective or at least makes these entries a bit more realistic.  Also, this story is very very dramatic - maybe too dramatic.  Obviously when it involves people and their loved ones, it is expected.  The language is beautiful and deeply personal - I just thought it was overdone in spots.<br />But I recommend this to anyone who wants to read a suspenseful tale.  This is not a horror story, but it's an overall fun book to read.	2001-06-08

My problem with the book is that it is boring or at least it goes into too much detail here and there.  I'm referring to the endless descriptions of water, molluscs, sea creatures, vegatation, and so on.  Now if you're one of the few sea-faring persons - one who loves the sea and loves sailing or boating or whatever, then you will enjoy the book.  I did enjoy all the action scenes and any scenes that had dialogue or interaction between Nemo and the Professor.  There was just so much detail that I practically skimmed through those pages.  I feel bad that I did not have interest in these subjects, but it was just too much and after some point, not very interesting.	2001-05-16

I'm not sure if it was me or the book, but the ending was a great one and I wish more of the book featured that same kind of adrenaline rush.<br />One great device Leroux used was switching the perspectives - one chapter is told through the eyes of Rauol and then the next is through the eyes of the Persian while overall we are being told the story as a case study.<br />Maybe I was influenced by the fact that there were movies and musicals made out of this because though it did not tell the story as well or as in great detail, they set the mood so well. You're enchanted and haunted by this mysterious character.  I think that was lacking from the book - seeing Raoul crying and whining so much about something just made me roll my eyes because I could not feel that emotion. Same thing with Christine and the two stage-managers acting like bumbling fools and astonished at everything.<br />&quot;Opera Ghost&quot;? Oh no.  Definitely enjoyable book - but more of a detective/Sherlock Holmes story with much more detail.	2001-05-08

I was utterly confused by the movie so I bought this book and suddenly things became clearer.  The three sub-stories threaded so well together and the amount of detail is staggering, but not overwhelming.  I never considered myself a science-fiction fan, but Clarke and Kubrick hit the nail on this subject and it was just fun to read this book.	2001-05-01

I am a baseball fan so I definitely got caught up in the pennant race, but what captured my imagination was the essence of the story.  The story features characters and events and descriptions that just feel so real and they are in the eyes of Henry Wiggen.  It's strange that Henry gives us all this information and details of his early baseball career, but yet he needs to figure out what is really important in his life.  I commend Harris for fabricating a story that felt genuine and did not cheat the main character by straying off the plot which is to be about Henry Wiggen.  I also appreciate the breaking down of the baseball mystique of its players - reading about Sad Sam Yale and Dutch made me realize even more how far baseball players really are separate from heroes.	2001-04-25

Regarding the latter, I've become so accustomed to seeing movies and reading books in an out-of-order fashion and it's fun to do so.  Always there will be some confusion at the beginning, but the order of events clears up.  The humor was more of this ludicrous type - the type where you're reading something and you say to yourself &quot;Well that is just silly&quot; because it was written to be like that.  But maybe my complaint stems from that in regard to the whole alien kidnapping thing. When I started reading that, I could not take this book seriously anymore.  Was that the Vonnegut's intent?  This is what war can do to a person?  This is how a person reacts to war?  Billy becomes &quot;unstuck in time&quot; so he doesn't think about war or face the realities of war?  If Vonnegut wants to say that war is silly and pointless, well of course it is - we all agree on that.<br />Basically Billy went mildly insane and this is what the book details in its plot.  Maybe the point did get across to me, but it was a point not worth repeating again and again.  I was looking for something a little deeper or more meaningful.	2001-04-23

While it is true that I and many others have been de-sensitized to violence, the book delves into a different kind of violence.  I guess what scared me after reading A Clockwork Orange was that we do not really know why Alex was &quot;evil&quot;.  Alex would do his thing every night, come home to sleep, then in the morning, gets up and eat breakfast and usually goes to school. What is up with this guy?<br />Usually when you see movies or read books that involve killings and other types of violence, you can always trace the reason to a person or an event that happened previously.  Even in the Columbine shootings and others like it, the kids had reasons and they acted out this anger.<br />But in A Clockwork Orange, Alex chose this evil.  This freaks me out.  It's not I find the other type acceptable, but when shoud people ever have a choice between a good and evil lifestyle?<br />Anyway, the book was good.  It took me like 15 minutes to read the first three pages because of the Nadsat language.  Make a printout of the words and keep it on hand when reading.  The first-person narrative was great and I do think the movie makes the book better because you don't quite get all the emotions of Alex out of the book.  For example, you can hear him laugh and giggle during a rape scene in the movie - something you can never get from a book even if you have a great imagination.  Then reading about his trip to the chair to watch the films - wow - it was described so well - you actually had to feel for the guy.<br />I did get a little turned off by the politics - maybe that is because I always get turned off by politics.  But this book was great!!	2001-04-23

Every action and reaction was described in a lush amount of detail and the imagery comes to you directly.  There were times when I worried that all this detail would be for naught - meaning the payoff at the end of the story would not be enough thus I would feel cheated.  But this story did not disappoint.<br />I loved reading about the characters and then reading their minds so lucidly.  Mr. Taneja and Mr. Jalil were two characters that got my attention by trying to hard to strive to their goals.  Every main character had something going on - something they must do, but they had to fight all the questions and obstacles in their way.<br />This is one of the few novels that will have a timeless quality.  The reason is that it explores issues such as religion, social work, marriage, and family and the questions Suri raised here will be the same questions asked over and over again in the future.<br />For anyone who is willing to read about another person dealing with questions such as this, read &quot;Death Of Vishnu&quot;.	2001-03-30

You become completely immersed in the Victorian culture and at the same time Crichton involves you in an intriguing soon-to-be robbery. This is not necessarily about the characters, but about the times the robbery took place.  The amount of detail is quite voluminous, but not enough to stop reading.  Every chapter, I said to myself &quot;Oh great, another thing I have to learn about the culture and the society before reading about the robbery&quot;, but after the first page of each chapter, I'm into it again.<br />This is up there with &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; - highly recommend.	2001-03-27

Initially after reading this book, I thought to myself &quot;what a great fun story to read&quot;, but now the more I think about it, it disappointed me.<br />I liked the premise of an adventure through time travel.  Reading a Crichton novel means you will get some understanding of certain subjects like quantum engineering or paleontology or underwater sea exploration and a great story that uses this knowledge to enhance the adventure.  So same thing here, right? Well, after a while, you're reading simply an adventure of a few people in the medieval times.  It got tiresome and it was missing some real tension.  Another problem is the characters who went back in time - they're like superheroes.  Leaping from beam to beam and jousting with knights and fighting in hand to hand combat with knights - come on!<br />There were some cool aspects to the adventure such as the countdown and a twist here and there, but it was too implausible overall.  Would not recommend it.	2001-03-20

D'Souza did not make the mistake of going too deeply into any of the areas he discussed in this book.  He did not dive into the issues of religion, the economy, genetic technology, or others, instead he stayed on the surface - probing some experts or scholars in these various subjects for their thoughts, added some of his own thoughts and examples, and finally lets you think about it.<br />This book is important just to get a sense of what is ahead in the future.  No one can predict the future, but I got a feeling that D'Souza has thought about this a great deal and knows what he is talking about.  There are issues to think about such as the role of technology, how it affects the family as a core unit, the rise of the overclass, and genetic engineering (very scary issue).<br />Definitely recommend.	2001-03-07

This book reminded me a lot of Catch-22 by Heller because of the wartime scene and its cast of characters. Though King Rat is not that humorous, Clavell still wrote a fascinating story.<br />His style so easily reveals the key characters and what they're all about.  Learning about King and Marlowe and Grey - early in the book, you know everything you need to know about them.  The key is the dynamics between them - the interaction between them.  I enjoyed every conversation between Marlowe and the King because I as the reader could feel the electricity.<br />As it happens with any good story, you get so immersed in &quot;their&quot; (prisoners') situation, that you suddenly realize how much your view has changed throughout the story.  That is good writing.<br />I tried hard to read Clavell's Shogun - heck I went traveling to another country and still couldn't finish it - it's too long - it was a great epic but I needed answers or conclusions.  King Rat is much shorter and as powerful.<br />One other mention - the version I bought included 5 or 6 sets of 10-15 pages that discussed what happened to a few of the wives of the prisoners.  You can buy either version - the story of the wives' is interesting and touching, but you're not going to get your sappy Hollywood ending in this one so it doesn't add to the story much.	2001-02-20

It does not blow you away but it does keep you hooked throughout the whole series.  I loved Books 1 and 2 the most.<br />The series mainly takes you all over the world through the eyes of Garion, a young boy who learns sorcery.  The beauty of the series are the characters - all the characters are likable and we get to read of their exploits.<br />This isn't necessarily a deep philosophical series and it's mainly dialogue, but it's adventure.	2001-02-20
US	47874852	RH45QH82GAZ2Q	0385493622	603019861	Fermat's Enigma: The Epic Quest to Solve the World's Greatest Mathematical Problem	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Good historical read	Who would have thought you can enjoy a book about math?  I am a math major, but I still didn't want to read a book that is more like a textbook with some interesting bits squeezed in about Fermat's theorem.  Fortunately I got what I wanted in reading a STORY in the context of a math problem.  The story is real and the people are real and Singh did a great job of capturing the essence of the story and its participants.<br />This mainly reads like a history book for the first half and then becomes a detailed news report in the second half flush with quotes and happenings.  To read about Andrew Wiles' saga is incredible and how long it took him to go through with this.<br />I might be saying this from a non-math enthusiast perspective, but I wanted a little more commentary on what all this means.  How about the fact that most likely Wiles did not use the same tools to solve Fermat's Thm as Fermat himself?  Maybe Fermat didn't solve the theorem?  I always say in my math book in the margins of the page &quot;Oh I have a ingenious proof of this theorem, but I don't feel like writing it now&quot;.  How about the real-world and mathematical impact of this theorem and its proof?<br />It's a fun historical read and the math you need to know for this book is elemental college-level, but don't expect much more than this.	2001-02-20
