Many board members have never had to face the daunting, time-consuming process involved in executive transition.  ED turnover is more rapid than in years past, owing to reasons such as the increase in nonprofit organizations, changing (and often more demanding) board and stakeholder expectations of EDs, and increased willingness on the part of both boards and EDs to part company over issues of mission, policy, and management.<br /><br />This book is an excellent description of the basics of executive director transition, including descriptions of factors that lead to executive director transition and checklists for board members, interim EDs, and others to use in making the transition in nonprofit management as painless as possible.<br /><br />The authors cite seven \\"factors,\\" or reasons, EDs leave a nonprofit: career ladder (advancing in a career), godfather (\\"they made me an offer I couldn't refuse\\"), gone fishing (the ED who is no longer attending to business), sudden loss (injury, illness, or death of the ED), burnout, cutting the mustard (not getting the job done), and the ten-year factor (many EDs sense it's time to leave, or board culture changes over time to signal to the ED that a change is needed).  My consulting practice has included many clients with examples of overlapping factors (the burnout ten-year ED who no longer cuts the mustard and goes fishing), but the basic categories are valid and recognizable.<br /><br />I especially like the chapter on building strong board-ED relationships.  Hiring a new ED represents a fresh opportunity for the board and ED to clarify roles, set expectations, and build the trust and respect that are central to effective nonprofit governance.  Of course, part of that process is building transition planning into the new ED's job responsibilities and the board's expectations for its own performance.  After all, one goal of ED transition should be that it's easier the next time.After all, one goal of ED transition should be that it's easier the next time. <br />	2005-07-25
US	49284541	R36EGAY1WTNQH1	0060753943	64382191	Winning	Books	4	1	3	N	N	Good, but not Great	Jack Welch, former CEO of General Electric, has written a second book on business and the lessons he's learned in four decades with GE and two decades as GE's CEO. His basic advice on strategic planning and vision statements are alone worth the price of the book. He also discusses how to select a career path, how to get promoted, how to deal with a tough boss, and the evolution of the work-life balance as a concept for today's executive.<br /><br />He also goes into greater detail about his controversial doctrine that managers should evaluate their staffs. He believes in using a model that says that 20% are outstanding and should be promoted as leaders, 70% are average and should be further investigated to see who might be developed into leadership, and 10% are underpeformers who should be placed on probation with an eye to dismissing them from their employment. Welch believes that most employee assessment processes do a disservice to the employee as well as the organization by not candidly assessing true performance. This leaves organizations performing below capacity and some employees vulnerable to dismissal during lean times while having no clue why they were the ones chosen and having had no opportunity to improve.<br /><br />His perspective is heavily influenced by his own experiences ad those of his former company, GE.  Few examples come from other corporate environments, or from history and the experiences of others outside GE.  Welch shares a weakness common to business book authors -- the ability to generalize from personal experiences to life in general, but an inability or neglect for taking life in general and applying it to his or others' specific situations.  Accept this limitation, work around it by using your own imagination, and the book becomes much more useful and enjoyable.	2005-06-27

It also analyzes each segment of the nonprofit sector and brings out some key data and observations about each one.  Finally, it seeks to look into the future of nonprofits.  Anyone interested in the sector, and especially nonprofit executive directors, consultants, and others who should be involved in global nonprofit strategy will find this book to be a valuable resource.<br /><br />The first striking lesson I learned from Dr. O'Neill's book is that, while the nonprofit sector has been growing significantly in the past 30 years, in many ways it has just kept pace with the rest of the economy.  Personal, corporate, and foundation giving are remarkably stable, and the percentage of charity dollars given by donors to segments such as education, health care, the arts, and international causes have remained constant since the 1970s.  Even the growth in the number of new nonprofits seeking IRS recognition has been relatively constant (in percentage terms) since at least the early 1980s.<br /><br />The dollar totals change, but the percentages are constant.  Knowing this prompts important questions about how charities plan, how and whether they solicit for funds, and where likely support is to be found for new initiatives.<br /><br />Dr. O'Neill doesn't shrink from acknowledging the vast amount we don't know about the nonprofit sector.  Anyone analyzing the data recognize that policymakers and researchers alike are making best guesses rather than reaching definite conclusions in many areas of analysis.  We're a long way from having \\"census\\" data on the nonprofit sector.<br /><br />There are almost 1 million charities recognized by the IRS, but we don't know for sure how many are active and how many are defunct.  There are almost 2 million nonprofits of all types (charities plus churches, labor unions, chambers of commerce, private clubs, etc.) that the IRS lists.  The Form 990 returns -- that only IRS-recognized charities with revenue greater than $25,000 are required to file -- are works of interpretation by filers as well as researchers.<br /><br />In fact, much nonprofit activity occurs outside record-keeping capabilities. Giving a friend's child the money to attend college, organizing a softball team, or countless other activities never reach the level of IRS recognition, much less scrutiny.  We can study what we know, and guess about the rest based on other data sources.<br /><br />Dr. O'Neill has done an admirable job of interpreting these other sources, adding the IRS and other government data, and presenting a plausible picture of the nonprofit economy.The Form 990 returns -- that only IRS-recognized charities with revenue greater than $25,000 are required to file -- are works of interpretation by filers as well as researchers. <br /> <br />In fact, much nonprofit activity occurs outside record-keeping capabilities.

Paul Light's latest book is an excellent analysis of capacity building and nonprofit organizations, based on survey research which yields surprising and very valuable results. However, the book's credibility is harmed by a flawed marketing attempt to tie public confidence in nonprofits to 9/11 and assert that relative lack of public confidence in charities is a recent phenomenon and that the change post-9/11 was significant.<br /><br />Light begins with a simple, yet elegant, logic chain: organizational capacity tends to lead to organizational effectiveness, which, in turn, bolsters public confidence and increases discretionary giving and volunteering.  As Light acknowledges, \\"Given the lack of objective data for measuring nonprofit capacity and effectiveness, perceptions will have to do for now.\\"  There is little data from the private (for-profit) sector on capacity-building, and most of that is negative or inconclusive as to what worked and why.<br /><br />He then reports on in-depth survey research he has performed with about 300 nonprofit organizations and their leaders.  This research substantiates the basic validity of the logic chain and sets some indicators for organizational development and increasing effectiveness.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, planning for change activities greatly increases their chance of success.  However, relatively few surveyed organizations employed significant pre-change planning.  Working with consultants tends to increase success, but relatively few survey respondents were confident in how they selected their consultant(s).  The presence of some external, directed funding increased success rates, but change activities paid totally through a grant or directed gift were not nearly as likely to be successful -- despite the omnipresent concerns relating to the cost of change and the perception of diverting funds from direct service or activities more closely linked to charitable mission.<br /><br />Finally, Light outlines a five-tiered nonprofit \\"development spiral\\" with life stages that include: 1) organic; 2) enterprising; 3) intentional; 4) robust; and 5) reflective.  He identifies the characteristics of each stage and the capacity-building activities most appropriate to each developmental stage.<br /><br />There is so much good information and insight in this book that it's hard to digest it all easily.  One is tempted to read it with both a highlighter and a legal pad for notes.  Some of the narrative recitations of the statistical data are tedious, but that does not mean that the text is too dense. There are a lot of \\"aha!\\" moments in the text, too, full of insight and ideas for both nonprofits and we consultants who seek to serve them and move their missions forward.<br /><br />Invest the time and energy in learning what the author has discovered.

It's easy to read, speaks directly to the reader, and makes excellent points about how -- and how not to -- do direct mail fund raising.  I'm not an expert on direct mail, but I've done it before.  Hitchcock's advice is right on target and easy to explain to non-development staff, board members, and volunteers.<br /><br />Hitchcock is President of Mal Warwick and Associates.  This firm does a lot of fund raising consulting, and Mal Warwick is well-known for his many books on nonprofit fundraising.  In fact, \\"Ten Steps to Fundraising Success\\" was co-written by Messrs. Warwick and Hitchcock.<br /><br />The book is organized around six key themes (see list below), and the 83 \\"chapters\\" are very short (often 3-4 pages each) ideas relating to the theme.  These ideas often include concrete advice, checklists, and lists of numbered tips that make the advice easy to follow.<br /><br />Much of the advice and knowledge is deceptively simple -- we feel we should know this, but often we don't act as through we do.  For example, the book instructs on how to keep an appeal simple, direct, informal, and free of verbal or physical clutter.  Did you know that including your nonprofit's brochure in a fundraising mailing actually decreases donor response?  Did you know that cramming a lot of words, no matter how well-written, on a single page to save a little printing and postage money actually costs your organization far more in lost donations?<br /><br />Reading this book has helped me in my consultation work with clients, in my work as a volunteer trustee of a national foundation, and as a consumer and citizen evaluating the direct mail appeals I receive all the time. Stephen Hitchcock is generous in writing a book that allows the rest of us to feel we're as savvy about direct mail fundraising as he has become through years of experience.	2004-12-08

Of course, PR and advertising are important to nonprofits, and these activities are part of a mission-based, customer-focused nonprofit's marketing plan.  Brinckerhoff has identified six steps in the nonprofit marketing cycle: 1) market definition and redefinition; 2) market inquiry; 3) service design & innovation; 4) setting your price; 5) promotion & distribution; and 6) evaluation.<br /><br />Nonprofits suffer from a unique \\"marketing disability\\" that inhibits their ability to reinvent themselves in a customer-focused way.  Brinckerhoff explains that marketing is about meeting customer wants, not customer needs.  Nonprofits, their staffs, boards, and donors/funders, often believe that wants are largely irrelevant -- nonprofits are designed to address clients' needs and gaps in services.<br /><br />Such thinking not only dulls the senses to client satisfaction, it also leads to thinking of donors and other potential funders (government contracts, grants, regulators, etc.) as adversaries rather than as customers.<br /><br />Nonprofits are becoming larger, more sophisticated, more \\"professional,\\" and increasingly competitive.  Brinckerhoff asserts that the days of a nonprofit's monopoly in a particular market is rapidly giving way to intrepid, marketing savvy, customer-focused competition.  Organizations slow to respond to changing markets are likely to find themselves under increased stress and decreasing clientele and funding support.<br /><br />The book is an excellent resource for boards as a strategic planning aid and for executives and staffs as an operational tool, complete with checklists and tables to aid each step in the marketing cycle.  As important as these procedural tools are, the real contribution of this book is to encourage all in the nonprofit sector to think about marketing as an integral part of overall strategy and operations.  Small, incremental changes will, over time, cause great systemic change and improvement in a nonprofit.  This book helps one develop the \\"marketing eye\\" that will open the opportunity for such changes.ortant as these procedural tools are, the real contribution of this book is to encourage all in the nonprofit sector to think about marketing as an integral part of overall strategy and operations.

It's concise and entertaining while delivering great messages.  This book does an excellent job of addressing two seemingly paradoxical points.  First, he asserts writing, and especially writing case statements for fund raising campaigns, is hard work.  Second, he then proceeds to provide the reader with the necessary support, tools, and guidance to make this hard work a lot easier.<br /><br />Like his other books, such as \\"Asking,\\" \\"Making the Case\\" is written in short, easily read chapters that are far more profound that they at first appear.  Re-reading the short chapters is well worth the time investment, because there are nuggets of wisdom that may pass by too quickly to be retained the first time around.<br /><br />The quotes from famous authors about the difficulty of writing are worth the price of the book.  Writing is hard work, and writing well is a result of either excruciating agony or divine inspiration.  Writing persuasively for a committee (or committees) about a subject of great passion and great financial import only compounds the pressure.  Finally, this task is often given initially to someone not accustomed to writing in this way.  Panas makes a compelling case for a nonprofit's fund raising case statement to be tackled by a professional with the experience, time, and informed distance from the charity's key stakeholders to provide a product that will be effective.<br /><br />Writing in simple language, always being forward-looking and present tense, leaving nothing unsaid, and writing in a captivating style are keys to case statement success, and Panas uses many examples from his own practice to illustrate the points.  Appendices include sample case statement titles (should be gripping to the reader) and sample paragraphs from case statements.  These examples should not be expected to be \\"ready for use.\\"  Each case statement is different, and the language should be original.  However, the samples help the reader think more like a case statement writer, and that is very helpful.  The appendices also include a case statement checklist and an evaluation tool to help you assess whether your case statement is complete and ready for presentation.<br /><br />Arguably, the best sample of case statement writing in the book is the book itself.  Reading these pages makes me believe I can write effective, inspiring case statements.  Isn't that precisely the reaction we wish from donors reading our own case statements -- to identify with the case and be impelled to act?the reader think more like a case statement writer, and that is very helpful.

Using the advice in this book will help the reader think and act like an experienced proposal writer.<br /><br />The chapters are short, concise, and well-written -- a good mantra for crafting successful foundation proposals.  Chapter titles include \\"Maps Help,\\" \\"Needing Money Isn't Enough,\\" and \\"Getting Unstuck.\\"  If you've written a lot of proposals and helped a lot of clients, you'll find yourself saying \\"Yes, people need to know that!\\" as you read the book.<br /><br />I recommend the book highly.  I wish that the author had addressed Federal and other governmental proposal writing as well, for two main reasons.  First, while it's a great idea to solicit advice and counsel from a foundation's staff, it's between difficult and impossible to work with a government program officer while drafting a proposal.  Working without this counsel requires the proposal writer to hone all the more closely to the written application guidelines -- a point not made as directly in the book as it might have been.<br /><br />Second, the very brevity and conciseness valued by foundation program officers may actually work against a Federal or other governmental proposal being funded.  The written guidance often mandates a certain amount of repetition between proposal sections, both in material to be covered and, occasionally, in the structure of the proposal itself.<br /><br />These two small issues aside, I really like this book.  One particularly  effective use of it would be as a supplemental text when delivering grantsmanship training.  The book includes much of the good advice a trainer would give orally while handing out written materials on the minutiae of the grant application.  Reading \\"Knockout Proposals\\" is like having a grantsmanship coach at your side during the writing process.Knockout Proposals\\" is like having a grantsmanship coach at your side during the writing process. <br />	2004-10-18

They include sample letters to donors and prospects, how to deal with a prospective donor's<br />objections to making a gift, a side-by-side list of differences between annual giving and major gifts, and rough guidelines for prospecting donors for each<br />type of gift.<br />Objections are the stated reasons why a prospect is hesitant about making a gift. Objections aren't &quot;no&quot;; they are the last hurdles to saying &quot;yes.&quot; One technique described in the book is the &quot;feel, felt, found&quot; approach to overcoming objections. Identifying with the prospect's objection (&quot;feel&quot;), placing it in the past tense (felt&quot;), by demonstrating how others were able to overcome that objection (&quot;found&quot;) is a powerful way to move the prospect toward making the desired gift.<br />The mix of techniques, hard information, and empowering inspiration makes this book valuable for professional as well as volunteer fund raisers. As I read it, I thought of several friends and colleagues (like you) who would appreciate its lessons, and I'm sure you will, too.	2003-09-17

BoardSource (formerly the National Center for Nonprofit Boards) has recently issued a 48-page booklet that demystifies the planning process. It shows nonprofit executives how to work through the process, defines the roles of boards, executives, and staffs. It even addresses how (and whether) to retain a consultant to assist with planning.<br />As a marketing professor I know says, &quot;If you're reacting to the market, you're not following a strategy.&quot; Planning is most needed when conditions are adverse or uncertain or when the day-to-day is clouding the long-term.  Not every time is the right time to begin strategic planning, however: organizations in imminent crisis such as litigation, excessive board turnover, or in the process of hiring a new executive should delay planning until the short-term emergency is handled.<br />The booklet includes several checklists and appraisal forms to assist in issues such as determining whether the organization is ready to plan, determining appropriate stakeholder involvement in planning, monitoring the planning process, and the elements of a written strategic plan.<br />Some experts argue that the board needs to take the lead in strategic planning, but often it falls to the executive to guide the board, as well as staff and other stakeholders, through that responsibility.<br />The authors rightly contend that the purpose of planning is not a document, but rather shared understanding and the basis for renewed, coordinated, mission-focused activity.<br />This booklet is a concise, easy-to-read introduction to planning process that demonstrates the relevance and benefits to a nonprofit in having a solid plan. &quot;The strategic planning process is a management tool designed to improve the effectiveness of an organization...Strategic planning is, in essence, a disciplined approach to decide what an organization is, what it does, and why it does it, with a focus on the future.&quot;it, with a focus on the future.&quot;	2003-08-29

It was too small and slim to be useful, I thought.  Wrong!  It's full of good ideas and timely reminders for anyone who makes their living from causing and fulfilling other people's buying decisions.<br />As a consultant (rather than a product salesperson), some of the product-oriented advice wasn't applicable to my practice.  The advice to \\"dollarize\\" customers' benefits are easier with \\"hard products\\" than they are with \\"soft services,\\" but Fox does not address this challenge.<br />Those issues aside, I like the short but intense style, with each of the chapters taking little more than 2-3 pages (500-750 words).  I remember watching a friend of mine, an antiques dealer, work with a customer.  I thought, \\"He forgot to ask killer sales question number...,\\" letting the customer leave the store even after expressing specific interest in purchaing an item.  The book's style allows one to easily remember snippets like the six \\"killer sales questions\\" (each with its own chapter).<br />This is not a huckster's book, either.  There's a heavy message of respect for the customer, fair dealing, not wasting time (yours OR your customer's), and attentiveness to the customer's wishes.  Rainmakers thrive on relationships, not \\"quick kill\\" sales.<br />Fox also discusses this when addressing prospecting.  He recommends prospecting a reasonably small number of targeted customers and investing time and effort in each one.  PLan repeat contacts progressing toward a sale.  Don't scatter your time and talents all over the board, mistaking effort for accomplishment.<br />\\"Rainmaker\\" is a valuable addition to my consulting library, and its compact size will make it easy to carry along with me for inspiration and recollection.	2003-03-25

The main character's personal discoveries don't overwhelm the reader or the plot.  There is less law here than usual, but the law is the propelling force in the story.  The legal profession also gets a little better treatment here -- it's not black or white, corrupt or altruistic, but necessary and subject to fair interpretation.<br />The portraits of the heirs are, at times, hilarious.<br />I wish Grisham had done more with some of the subplots -- there's a lot of potential material there -- but the book tells its story well, and there's even a point to be made that a story can be told without revealing all to the reader.	2001-12-11

Some very good and insightful information is presented in a style heavily mixed with cheerleading \\"you can do it\\" boosterism and self-important, mundane pull-quotes, always attributed to the author herself.<br />It is important to note that this book teaches one nothing about how to write a successful grant application.  It is assumed that the reader is already experienced at grantsmanship, or is pursuing a separate road to acquire that knowledge.  This assumption is never stated in the promotional material or the cover text of the shrink-wrapped volume.  This oversight is serious, especially when considering the \\"you can do it, too!\\" tone of the text on the back cover.<br />Ms. Browning does a good job of identifying the materials and equipment necessary to starting a home-based business, but \\"dates\\" her material by recommending particular products and specifications for computers and peripherals.  She does a good job of providing some tables and checklists for helping the reader identify their expertise and probable target market for clients.  However, be wary of the opinions and statements about the legalities surrounding setting up a business in one's home; some communities' ordinances and covenants are not as tolerant as Ms. Browning implies.<br />As good and relevant as some of the basic advice may be, I cringed when I read about her marketing techniques.  The idea of monthly direct mail and telephone follow-up is a reasonable, though unusual, professional client recruitment strategy (the telephone follow-up is key).  It's more appropriate for recruiting speaking and teaching engagements than for specific grants preparation assignments, though this distinction is never explored.<br />However, the practice she follows and recommends of dropping business cards on workshop and conference tables, resource racks -- and even airplane seats and office restrooms where nonprofits have office space -- does damage to the professional image that most nonprofit-sector consultants work to project.  Of course, the author's company name, with three dollar signs in place of the letter \\"S,\\" is another indicator that a professional image is not being cultivated.  Most readers, especially those with a grounding in the nonprofit sector and therefore those most likely to benefit from a book on the topic, will not see themselves in such a blatant promotional/sales role and will need to seek alternate strategies, equally effective, with which they (and their clients) are more comfortable.<br />Building a consulting practice in the field of grantsmanship can be a rewarding experience in many ways, and can take many forms.

It definitely lives up to the promise of the assertion on the book jacket that the authors, &quot;...who collectively have more than 70 years of experience as chief executives, board members, and facilitators in the training of more than 20,000 board members in 20 countries...&quot;<br />The book is comprised of 37 short chapters (typically 3-6 pages each) in five sections, designed to address all aspects of board service and board/staff issues.  Each chapter provides facts, opinions, tools, and a few &quot;suggested action steps&quot; to help a board address the issue or situation presented in the chapter.<br />In general, the authors reference John Carver as a good resource for the theory and practice of nonprofit governance, but they don't make Carver the precise and proscriptive recipe that some adherents do.  They admit the possibility that other techniques and structures can work well for certain organizations, while &quot;sticking to their guns&quot; in presenting their experiences and insights as having inherent value for most nonprofits.<br />I was especially impressed by the distinction made between the role of the board and the role of board members.  Many policy governance disputes stem from a misunderstanding that, somehow, all board members should have the same responsibilities and be treated interchangeably.<br />I would have liked to see a clearer treatment of the issue of board diversity; interestingly, the authors seem to agree, admitting that it's a very difficult subject to address.  Many board &quot;diversity&quot; programs focus on narrowly-defined &quot;diversity&quot; and run the danger of leading to &quot;tokenism,&quot; according to the authors.<br />The charts and checklists that supplement the text are simple and effective.  They're easy for readers to re-create and use in their own organizations.<br />The book even admits of the possibility that nonprofits can (and sometimes should) dissolve and disband, and provides strategies for helping board, staff, and community understand, accept, and even support the natural cycle of life as it applies to organizations.  It's an important message and not a negative one.<br />Although originally published in December, 1997, it has already had three printings as of August, 1999.

No more special event fundraisers, no more sweating grant applications, no more &quot;moves management&quot; from sub-$100 donors to $500 to $5,000 to endowment givers, no more living hand-to-mouth and year-to-year.  Terry Axelrod presents a compelling case for restructuring the development function using a combination of revolutionary and evolutionary thinking.<br />In reading this book, I was finding myself alternately saying, &quot;Wow!  What an innovative approach!&quot; and &quot;That's a different way of saying what everyone's doing now!&quot;  The key to understanding these (seemingly) conflicting reactions is that the author proposes to: 1) treat all donors and prospects as major donors and prospects; and 2) not solicit support at any lower level.  She believes that a relatively small coterie of well-cultivated, passionate &quot;friends&quot; of a nonprofit bring far more stability and benefit to a nonprofit than the traditional &quot;donor pyramid.&quot;<br />One key to the success of her model is to AVOID asking for money until the prospect is ready to give.  Many development directors would cringe at the donation opportunities the author encourages one to pass up in favor of cultivating a deeper, longer-lasting relationship.  Facility tours, special events, and similar happenings are intended to be free, open, and low-pressure opportunities for the community to learn about the organization and its mission and for the organization to learn contact information on attendees and who is most likely to be interested in further contact on the donor's chosen terms.<br />One point made fairly early will unnerve many volunteer managers.  Ms. Axelrod points out that relatively few nonprofit  organizations are ready to listen to a prospective donor/volunteer and be prepared to accept what they are most willing to give.  If the nonprofit makes it easy for the donor to identify a need and volunteer the time and/or resources to fill that need, then they will have made a friend as well as enhanced services.  Ms. Axelrod places volunteer management squarely in the development arena and takes it out of its &quot;unpaid employee/HR management&quot; status.  Volunteers are donors and donors are volunteers, and they need to be recognized, cultivated, and sustained in the organization for their blended, &quot;customer-driven&quot; status.  This also means that the donor who &quot;just writes the check&quot; will also disappear, since the writers of the larger checks also tend to be involved in the nonprofit as volunteers.<br />In Ms. Axelrod's model, the lowest donor level is $1,000 per year ($83 per month), with a five-year commitment to give at that level.  From there, donors may be requested to give additional gifts during the period, accelerate the fulfillment of their pledges, increase their pledges, and refer selected friends and acquaintances.  Rather than the traditional &quot;strong-arm the Rolodex®&quot; fundraising model, donors invite friends to free, no obligation meet-and-greet/tour &quot;point of entry&quot; events as new entrants into the donor cycle.<br />The obvious advantages to this approach are that most giving is made by individuals, that most individuals are likely to give a gift, even when not properly cultivated, that properly cultivated donors will give more, more often, and longer than those not properly cultivated.  The disadvantages in this approach are that it requires a fair amount of planning, absolute &quot;buy-in&quot; from all levels of staff, and some &quot;front-end&quot; investment in time and energy.  However, the benefits in organizational financial stability, constituent loyalty, and independence from vagaries in grant funding cycles, political shifts, and economic trends are huge.<br />The book itself is structured somewhat like a donation cycle (in this case, the &quot;Raising More Money Model&quot;), with a few chapters dedicated to overview of the process, followed by chapters delving a little deeper into the specific steps, and ending with several chapters discussing specific strategies for specific steps in the cycle.  There is a little repetition and reinforcement in using this structural technique, but that's a good thing and not at all overdone.  Ms. Axelrod refers to her &quot;Raising More Money&quot; seminars, and it's easy to see the book's contents as components of two or three curricula, complete with the &quot;tell 'em what they're going to hear, tell 'em, and then tell 'em what they heard&quot; structure that works so effectively with adult learners in practical learning situations.<br />This book is far more than a traditional &quot;how to&quot; cookbook; it's both a theoretical challenge to traditional fundraising and a practical, step-by-step primer for implementation of Ms. Axelrod's new paradigm of fundraising.  Even those who challenge her premise will be hard-pressed to challenge her implementation techniques.More Money Model&quot;), with a few chapters dedicated to overview of the process, followed by chapters delving a little deeper into the specific steps, and ending with several chapters discussing specific strategies for specific steps in the cycle.

Like any tool, it's important to know how it should be used.  This set will be used best in training situations where a facilitator will be available to assist with interpreting the workbook materials and &quot;fleshing out&quot; some of the concepts.  But that's not a requirement; anyone interested in the subject can learn a lot from this introductory material.<br />I'm a little surprised that the authors/publishers chose to stick with the term &quot;grantwriter:&quot; many foundation staffs believe that THEY are the &quot;grant writers&quot; and that those seeking funding are preparing applications for grant funding.  However, the market holds to the term &quot;grantwriter&quot; for proposal applicants, and it is less cumbersome than anything else I've heard to describe those who prepare grant proposals and applications.<br />Watch the video first, and then tackle the workbook.  [In fact, the video makes absolutely no reference to the workbook.]  The video's 25 minutes are well-produced and feature foundation grants experts.  The videocassette I viewed seemed to have some minor audio problems, but that may have been my equipment rather than the video itself, and in any case, it didn't affect my understanding of the material.<br />The video presents the twelve elements of a successful foundation grant proposal, from the cover letter through the proposal narrative to the budget and appendices.  It also provides some basic tips for writing successful proposals: researching foundations; calling foundations for help; making your grant application easy to read and to navigate; writing in a clear, concise style that accurately presents a compelling case for funding, etc.<br />People preparing government grant applications show be wary of some of the specific advice in the video (like that to avoid double-spacing in foundation proposals), and I would have liked to see the video emphasize the overriding importance of preparing an application using the funding source's preferred format rather than a single &quot;best practice&quot; format, regardless of how professional it appears.  It would also have been nice to see some mention of the workbook in the video, if only to reassure the viewer that they don't have to take copious notes while watching.<br />The 64-page large format workbook takes the writer through the organizational and &quot;thinking&quot; steps necessary to prepare a good grant application.  There are seven exercises to help develop a clear mission and objectives, determine evaluation steps, pencil out a budget, etc.  The next section of the workbook shows examples of each of the twelve components of a grant application on the right-side pages.  The left-facing pages contain descriptions of each section and tips for writers, similar to the material covered in the video.  The workbook's final section provides tips on strategy and structure, and discusses why not all applications are successful, again closely following the content at the end of the video.<br />The Grantwriter's Start-Up Kit will give novices a good introduction to the subject and some basic tools, and is a great &quot;off the shelf&quot; tool for facilitators and instructors seeking to expose others to the world of grantsmanship.see the video emphasize the overriding importance of preparing an application using the funding source's preferred format rather than a single &quot;best practice&quot; format, regardless of how professional it appears.

Books	5	11	11	N	N	Excellent primer for the new debate	The issue of &quot;charitable choice&quot; and faith-based organizations' eligibility for federal funding for social service programs is a very important topic of discussion in nonprofit and governmental circles, as well as among the general public.  This book is a collection of essays from some of the leading thinkers in the field on these issues and others related to religion and public policy in America.<br />E.J. Dionne is a Senior Fellow in Governmental Studies at the Brookings Institution and a columnist for the Washington Post, and his co-editor, John DiIulio, now serves as the Director of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives.<br />The first essay alone is worth the price of the book and more.  &quot;God and the American Experiment -- an Introduction,&quot; co-authored by the editors, eloquently lays out the perspectives of the book's respective contributors and weaves them into a description of the history, the paradoxes, and the ambiguities inherent in the issue of the role and limitations of religious involvement in public life in America.  Advocates for, and opponents of, expanding access to government support by private organizations seeking to address social ills are found across all party, religious, and ideological lines.<br />That last point is important enough to reiterate.  Both President Bush and former Vice President Gore campaigned in 2000 on platforms that included expansion of access by faith-based organizations to federal support.  Although the initiative is often suspected of being a tactic of Christian conservatives, the two government leaders responsible for its implementation, Mr. DiIulio and Stephen Goldsmith, are a Catholic Democrat and Jewish Republican, respectively.  Liberal Senator Paul Wellstone is generally favorable to the concept, while Reverend Pat Robertson of the Christian Coalition is opposed.  The book's introduction explores these unusual alliances and perspectives in a coherent and balanced way.<br />The essays themselves are a mixed bag of scholarship and opinion, of social science and ad hominem advocacy.  It also includes some essays which are more tangential to the issue of faith-based initiatives, like the personal memoir from one of the religious counselors  that former President Clinton asked to help him in the fall of 1998 during the Monica Lewinsky scandal.<br />Mr. DiIulio's essay on the history and characteristics of the involvement of black churches in community programs, and his colleague Ram Cnaan's writing on &quot;Our Hidden Safety Net&quot; provide both anecdotal and statistical evidence that faith-based organizations, and especially minority churches in inner-city neighborhoods, are the best source and only source of help for at-risk children who are often forsaken by secular social service programs.  Mr. Cnaan is emphatic in his assertion that community organizations cannot pick up the slack left by federal devolution of welfare programs to the states; the states will have to increase programs and funding to fill the void.  However, the void would be a chasm without the faith-based providers, and supporting them is supporting those most at-risk, which is the stated goal of almost all involved in social service.<br />The case against charitable choice is presented by Melissa Rogers, the general counsel at the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs.  Her essay asserts that charitable choice is an unconstitutional breaching of the separation of church and state, as well as a danger to the mission of faith-based organizations themselves.  The demand for public accountability could jeopardize many of the liberties enjoyed by religious organizations, should they choose to receive government funds.<br />The debate over the role of religion in American society has achieved decisive status twice before in our history: once at the founding, and once again at the turn of the 20th century.  What's God Got To Do With The American Experiment? is evidence of its re-emergence at the turn of the 21st century and a valuable primer for identifying the issues and framing the debate.  The issues have emerged in new forms and the battle lines are not what one would expect.evidence of its re-emergence at the turn of the 21st century and a valuable primer for identifying the issues and framing the debate.

In fact, I surprised myself by getting a little wrapped up in the storyline of the fictional case study being used to illustrate the steps in the process.<br />&quot;Page-turner&quot; isn't a term usually applied to management books, but this one almost deserves it.  The actual &quot;story&quot; itself is sometimes almost painful as fiction -- I really wish the authors had consulted a dialogue editor -- but the story acts as a thread to connect the key elements and illustrate some of the issues faced when building performance management systems.<br />The authors' thesis is that executives and managers spend too much time tracking too many performance indicators, often focusing time on unimportant measures or indicators outside their scope of control.  Front-line employees and supervisors are uncertain what they're being measured against, and feel they are powerless to influence quality or efficiency.<br />The performance scorecards approach can be initiated at any management level.  Through a series of data collection and staff meetings, goals, objectives, indicators, and responsibilities can be agreed upon.  Each manager, project, and even many employees can have &quot;scorecards&quot; that interlock with everyone else's in the organization, reflecting the interdependencies required for organizational success.<br />There are six key steps in performance scorecards: Collect, Create, Cultivate, Cascade, Connect, and Confirm.<br />There are strong team-building aspects to this model.  Not only does it stress interdependence, it also fosters decentralization of responsibility, authority, and accountability.  Further, it encourages openness about results and how they are expressed and communicated.<br />The process does depend on a quantitative as well as qualitative expression of indicators and results.  This may scare off some service organizations.  However, the team-based, consensus approach to determining a way to translate the qualitative to the quantitative minimizes the friction and suspicions of &quot;unfairness&quot; in the process.<br />The process allows no wiggle room for the employee who says that a particular objective or outcome is not measurable.  If it's not measurable, then it shouldn't be an objective, according to the authors.<br />The authors are consultants, and they stress the importance of a trained facilitator as part of the process.  The investment is well worth the outcomes in employee morale as well as productivity and success in fulfilling a mission and being able to demonstrate it.  The book contains numerous illustrations, figures, and a few tools to help the narrative explanation of the process.ations.

Challenge, plan, and result -- &quot;CPR.&quot;<br />Each vignette uses the &quot;CPR&quot; format, followed by &quot;questions to ask&quot; (if you're facing the same challenge), &quot;lessons learned,&quot; and &quot;last word,&quot; usually a one-sentence summation of the &quot;moral&quot; of the story.<br />All kinds of organizations are profiled, and it was fun to see CharityChannel regulars as Lynn Shaftic-Averill among the experts sought for their expertise and &quot;war stories.&quot;  &quot;The Pig that Saved the 'Y'&quot; chronicles the success of the YWCA of the Tonawandas in staving off financial collapse.  They used a board member's connection with a local nonprofit theater to arrange for a benefit showing of the movie &quot;Babe&quot; as a joint fundraiser, and the 'Y' was saved from serious and imminent financial danger.  The film showings are now annual fundraising events.<br />Like the first-aid kit on the cover, the book contains a lot of tools that are specific to a situation.  Just as you wouldn't use all the tools in the first aid kit at the same time, the book is best read sporadically, almost as a reference manual, when you're looking for help or inspiration.<br />Unfortunately, also like the first-aid kit, the book is unable to provide comprehensive relief, or information, for the patient/reader seeking assistance.  To say that the book uses a &quot;band-aid&quot; approach sounds pejorative, but it really isn't. Band-aids are important tools, as are many of the stories in the book.  However, people buying this book believing that they'll find the answers for an organization in trouble will be disappointed.<br />CPR for Nonprofits is a good &quot;ready-reference&quot; book for stimulating ideas and brainstorming, best read in small doses over time.

Many are seeking creative ways to harness community support and increase funding availability, especially to fund &quot;non-core&quot; areas such as arts, in-service professional and paraprofessional training, athletics, and capital expenditures.<br />Over the last 20 years or so, about one-fourth of America's 16,000 school districts have established some form of endowment or private foundation (either district-wide or school-specific) to supplement other school revenue to meet identified needs and expand opportunities for students and teachers.<br />Rarely have I found a book on a specialized subject so accessible and easy to use.  The book's authors take the reader through the process of conceptualizing, developing, and implementing a public school foundation, often using a plausible question and answer format to communicate concepts and steps in an almost conversational way.<br />The book assumes that the reader is an individual who is interested in starting a public school foundation -- a teacher, administrator, PTA or school board member.  Two excellent points are made very early in the book.  First, it doesn't take a lot of money to make a real impact in a school district -- $10 or $20 per student can translate into some very useful, innovative, and change-provoking projects.  Second, it's not necessary to &quot;front-load&quot; a school foundation with lots of money in order to generate a trickle of grant awards.  The enthusiasm of the anticipated reader is matched and bolstered by the authors' enthusiasm for the subject.<br />Creating Foundations for American Schools also addresses the issue of existing foundations that have lost momentum or otherwise failed to meet expectations.  One of the real keys to success is building and maintaining interest and momentum behind the foundation and its mission.  The importance of coordinating foundation activities with alumni associations and other school-based fundraising is discussed as well.<br />The appendices include a wealth of forms, checklists, sample letters, etc., to use in the foundation-building process.  Appendix E was a real surprise -- an annual survey of state laws governing charitable solicitation, complete with contact information for each state's regulators.<br />This is a well-executed book on a timely subject.  It deserves to be used -- not just on the shelf -- wherever public school foundations are in place or contemplated.ions and other school-based fundraising is discussed as well.<br />The appendices include a wealth of forms, checklists, sample letters, etc., to use in the foundation-building process.

Mr. McCormick's excellent treatment of the subject. Nonprofit Mergers is also an excellent work, but very different in style and tone.<br />This is a serious book on a difficult subject by someone who has been there. The author's experience and his ability to weave his experience into the narrative was very helpful in establishing his credibility and his &quot;hands-on&quot; as well as his theoretical knowledge of the subject.<br />I was especially impressed by his assertion, which I share, that nonprofit mergers rarely save any significant money, and should not be advocated or undertaken for economic reasons. There's an easy 4% or so in savings that can be realized from almost any merger; expecting more usually leads to disappointment. The reasons to merge may be &quot;positive:&quot; enhancing efficiency, effectiveness, community image, fundraising ability, etc.; or the reasons may be &quot;negative:&quot; Mr. McCormick has a good explanation of how factors unrelated to mission can lead to a spiral from liability concerns to viability concerns to survivability concerns.<br />The merger process is detailed, with cogent explanations of the rationale for each step. There are serious legal, financial, and organizational/administrative issues to be faced all along the way, and tips on selecting and working with competent and experienced counsel are included, along with case studies, tables, forms, and samples.<br />His caution about using counsel specifically trained in nonprofit mergers is well-take, Many specialists in working with for-profit mergers don't appreciate the importance of the emotional issues involved in mergers, and how a single volunteer with (seemingly) no &quot;power&quot; can scuttle the entire process. Nonprofit mergers must be a far more open process than their for-profit counterparts' could ever be.<br />The book is well-sourced and well-researched, though the attributions sometimes impede the flow of the narrative.

Many are seeking creative ways to harness community support and increase funding availability, especially to fund &quot;non-core&quot; areas such as arts, in-service professional and paraprofessional training, athletics, and capital expenditures.  <br />Over the last 20 years or so, about one-fourth of America's 16,000 school districts have established some form of endowment or private foundation (either district-wide or school-specific) to supplement other school revenue to meet identified needs and expand opportunities for students and teachers.<br />Rarely have I found a book on a specialized subject so accessible and easy to use.  The book's authors take the reader through the process of conceptualizing, developing, and implementing a public school foundation, often using a plausible question and answer format to communicate concepts and steps in an almost conversational way.<br />The book assumes that the reader is an individual who is interested in starting a public school foundation -- a teacher, administrator, PTA or school board member.  Two excellent points are made very early in the book.  First, it doesn't take a lot of money to make a real impact in a school district -- $10 or $20 per student can translate into some very useful, innovative, and change-provoking projects.  Second, it's not necessary to &quot;front-load&quot; a school foundation with lots of money in order to generate a trickle of grant awards.  The enthusiasm of the anticipated reader is matched and bolstered by the authors' enthusiasm for the subject.<br />Creating Foundations for American Schools also addresses the issue of existing foundations that have lost momentum or otherwise failed to meet expectations.  One of the real keys to success is building and maintaining interest and momentum behind the foundation and its mission.  The importance of coordinating foundation activities with alumni associations and other school-based fundraising is discussed as well.<br />The appendices include a wealth of forms, checklists, sample letters, etc., to use in the foundation-building process.  Appendix E was a real surprise -- an annual survey of state laws governing charitable solicitation, complete with contact information for each state's regulators.<br />This is a well-executed book on a timely subject.  It deserves to be used -- not just on the shelf -- wherever public school foundations are in place or contemplated.	2001-01-24

In case you've been trapped on a desert island for the past several years, IDG books has been publishing &quot;Dummies&quot;-themed books on every subject under the sun and moon, from Windows 2000 to sex.  Fundraising for Dummies is a typically informative, easy-to-read, and useful guide to fundraising for nonprofit organizations.<br />With 28 chapters in five parts and appendices of checklists and how-tos, the book has loads of information for novice and intermediate fundraisers alike.  In fact, it's also a pretty good reference for board members and volunteers involved in fundraising activities.<br />There is a chapter devoted to predictions on the future of philanthropy in the U.S., with one-paragraph explanations of brief statements, such as &quot;E-giving Will Grow.&quot;  Most of these predictions are obvious to nonprofit-sector experts (and especially those of us who participate on CharityChannel!).  However, I must admit to being intrigued by the idea that &quot;Nonprofits Will Rule!&quot;, meaning that, as more for-profits become regional and national in scope, local nonprofits will assume increasing local community leadership influence.<br />As good as this volume is in its general approaches and many helpful tips and techniques, do not mistake this book for a thorough treatment of the subject or any of its components.  I was alarmed by its breezy assertion that nonprofit board service<br />&quot;...is not as risky as serving on a for-profit board.  Nonprofit board members are protected personally from liability in any legal action against their charitable organization...&quot;<br />Haven't the authors heard of the IRS and Intermediate Sanctions?  And, since nonprofit corporations are state-chartered (like their for-profit brethren), wouldn't liability vary from state to state, as well as depending on the facts and circumstances of each case?  I would imagine that the D&amp;O liability insurers would like to address this before the second printing!<br />One benefit of this book I found is one which I'm not sure is intentional.  Grant writing is given short coverage in the appropriately-numbered Chapter 13 of the book, thereby providing two subtle reminders that grants are but a minor part of fundraising success.<br />Any reader interested in the subject will learn much from this book, as long as they don't take its accounting and legal advice too literally.<br />Table of Contents<br />Introduction<br />Part 1 -- Gearing Up to Raise Funds<br />Part 2 -- Getting to Know Your Donor<br />Part 3 -- Using Your Fundraising Tools<br />Part 4 -- On the (Fundraising) Campaign Trail<br />Part 5 -- The Part of Tens<br />Index/>One benefit of this book I found is one which I'm not sure is intentional.

This book is a good, though only partial, treatment of the subject of developing a seminar business from scratch.  It's actually better at teaching you how to promote yourself as a trainer or seminar leader than it is at showing you how to build a business.  It's \\"you can do it, too!\\" approach is empowering but woefully incomplete.<br /><br />Seminar leadership is a viable business in itself, as well as a component of any subject matter expert's business.  There is tremendous potential in establishing onself as an expert and selling that expertise though seminars, including \\"backroom sales\\" of books, videos, audiotapes, and related products.  Seminar attendees, book readers, etc., are also a potential audience for private consulting assignments.  The ability and drive to leverage one body of knowledge into multiple formats and venues is central to this book's purpose.<br /><br />After reading the book and listening to the companion audiotapes (sold separately), I attended a two-day \\"Seminar Leaders University\\" hosted by the American Seminar Leaders Association (ASLA), founded by the author and subsequently sold by him.  I hold their \\"Certified Seminar Leader\\" (CSL) designation.  However, none of these three resources addressed the *economics* of the seminar business or prepared me for the business of the seminar business.<br /><br />Begin with this book, and follow up with Howard Shenson's books, epecially \\"How to Develop and Promote Successful Seminars and Workshops: The Definitive Guide to Creating and Marketing Seminars, Workshops, Classes, and Conferences,\\" for the dollars and cents of marketing, testing, and delivering successful seminars.<br /><br />\\"How to Make it Big\\" should whet your appetite for more substantial fare to complement its enthusiasm and introduction to the subject.	2000-11-24

The authors do an excellent job of stressing that consulting is a serious business without overwhelming readers with jargon and legal process.<br />The book's sixteen chapters cover basic and advanced topics, from retaining an attorney BEFORE starting a consulting practice to how to handle the legal problems that may come up despite the consultant's best efforts to avoid them through good planning.  Concise narrative, entertaining case studies, and solid analysis are interspersed with examples of contracts and forms a consultant can use in their own practice.<br />The contracts and forms discussed and shown in the book are also included in a 3.5&quot; floppy disk.  The documents on the single PC-formatted diskette are stored in Word 6.0/95 format.<br />One of my personal pet peeves is sole-practitioner consultants who do not treat their consulting practice as a business.  The first few chapters of the book address all the contracts, agreements, and situations that a consultant faces before dealing with a client -- leasing office space, contracting for insurance, banking, telephone, advertising, and other services.  It's a useful reminder that a consultancy is more than a one-man-band, and that &quot;being your own boss&quot; involves significant responsibility and risk as well as significant freedom and personal satisfaction.<br />The chapter that discusses working with nonprofit clients is written from a for-profit perspective; the stereotypical case studies center on agencies with no budgets and volunteers making promises and representations the board can't or won't honor.  This is unfortunate, since most nonprofits, like their for-profit brethren, are fiscally sound, responsible corporations that can and do retain consultants in a businesslike way and compensate them based on their value.<br />Whether you're a novice or experienced consultant, The Consultant's Legal Guide is valuable as both a tutorial and a reference/resource work to help your practice succeed.<br />-- Table of Contents -- Introduction -- Selecting an Attorney  -- The Relationship of Ethics and the Law  -- Setting Up a Consulting Practice  -- Starting Your Office  -- Contracts and the Law  -- Employment Issues  -- Working with Other Consultants  -- Client Issues  -- Clients Outside the Corporate Arena  -- Unique Consulting Situations  -- Protecting Work Product, Trade Secrets, and Intellectual Property  -- Giving Credit Where Credit is Due  -- Protecting Assets Through Insurance  -- Buying or Selling a Consulting Practice  -- Avoiding Legal Problems  -- What to do When You Have a Legal Problem  -- Glossary -- IndexGuide is valuable as both a tutorial and a reference/resource work to help your practice succeed.<br />-- Table of Contents -- Introduction -- Selecting an Attorney  -- The Relationship of Ethics and the Law  -- Setting Up a Consulting Practice  -- Starting Your Office  -- Contracts and the Law  -- Employment Issues  -- Working with Other Consultants  -- Client Issues  -- Clients Outside the Corporate Arena  -- Unique Consulting Situations  -- Protecting Work Product, Trade Secrets, and Intellectual Property  -- Giving Credit Where Credit is Due  -- Protecting Assets Through Insurance  -- Buying or Selling a Consulting Practice  -- Avoiding Legal Problems  -- What to do When You Have a Legal Problem  -- Glossary -- Index	2000-11-24

Then I realized I was reading it as a consulting trainer rather than a corporate or nonprofit staff trainer.  Through that different viewpoint, this book is a brief and valuable guide for instituting and executing training evaluations.  Given the lack of good, easily accessible &quot;how-to&quot; information on the subject, this book makes an excellent starting point for trainers and training managers.<br />Bob Pike's introduction lists three assumptions and seven prerequisites for training success.  As a consultant, I can only wish that I would have the liberty to insist on these features for every client; as a staff trainer, I can easily see that I would need the organizational &quot;buy-in&quot; and cooperation to make my department's training a success.<br />The book was originally published in 1982 and re-released in 1992 and 1999.  The timelessness of the topic means that the information is still relevant and useful; however, I would have liked to see an updated bibliography in the 1999 edition.  All of the cited sources are from the 1970's.<br />The ten methods that comprise ten of the book's eleven chapters are brief and to-the-point.  Even when I don't agree with some of the details, the overall structure proposed by the author is sound and easily adaptable.<br />-- Introduction -- Foreword<br />-- Why Evaluate  -- Revelations!  -- The Basics of an Evaluation System  -- Planning the Evaluation System  -- Evaluation Systems: Planning the Ground Rules  -- Post Workshop Participant Evaluations  -- Post Workshop Leader Evaluations  -- The Follow-Up  -- Implementing the Evaluation System  -- Evaluation Questions and Why They Don't Work  -- Developing Evaluation Questions	2000-11-20

Most nonprofit board members and executives are only dimly aware of these changes, and fewer still are prepared with the documentation necessary to address issues of conflict of interest, private inurement, and disqualified persons.<br /><br />One sentence from the book's introduction sums up the need for action: \\"The most important aspect of this legislation is that it empowers the IRS to impose punishment on individuals who violate the tax code by levying significant excise taxes initially and then more than quadrupling the penalty amount if remedy is not made to the [nonprofit] organization.\\"<br /><br />The solution, and the purpose of the book, is also summed up in one sentence in the introduction: \\"The key to protecting these organizations' officers and other interested parties from excise taxes is proper documentation.\\"<br /><br />The book is 3-ring bound and well-tabbed for easy reference and for copying of template forms and sheets that are included.  In addition, the book ships with a companion PC diskette with forms in Microsoft Word 6.0/Word 95 format that should be usable by most current word processing programs.<br /><br />This book is a valuable resource for nonprofit executives, consultants, attorneys, and others providing organizational development and counseling to nonprofits and charities.<br /><br />The book does include examples and references to the health care field, but its content is equally applicable to all nonprofits.<br /><br />The book's Table of Contents is as follows:<br /><br />1.

Few bestselling books have 60 pages of endnotes, over 100 charts and tables, and an index spanning 45 pages.  If for no other reason, nonprofit sector professionals should buy this book for its statistical and reference data alone.  However, this book is far more than a reference volume; it uses data to tell a compelling story about America's civic and social involvement in the 20th century.<br />The data reported in the book confirm all kinds of influences that have been discussed by public policy experts, social researchers, and watercooler gossips for years -- declining civic club memberships; fewer people willing to take leadership positions in PTA, Boy Scouts, school boards, city councils, and countless other &quot;community-building&quot; pursuits.  Mr. Putnam addresses changing lifestyles, from two-paycheck and single-parent families to the increasing time consumed by home-workplace commuting, television, and other &quot;cocooning&quot; activities that reduce time and energy for &quot;other-directed&quot; activity.<br />The book's subtitle, &quot;The Collapse and Revival of American Community,&quot; is an apt description of the book that has been misunderstood by many of its critics.  Although Professor Putnam (Public Policy professor at Harvard) spends much of the book demonstrating the decline of civic &amp; social involvement and community in America during the last third of our century, he also discusses possible causal factors and even offers suggestions for renewal.<br />The book's final chapter compares America's late 19th century with the late 20th century.  He identifies numerous similarities that, he believes, point the way to addressing the current crisis as he sees it.  The chapter includes italicized goals for improvement in civic and social involvement.<br />The topic and thesis of the book, originally raised in a 1995 magazine article, will be with us for several more years.  The Ford Foundation and a group of community foundations have given Mr. Putnam $1 million to conduct additional research on how communities are addressing community-building issues and how effective those initiatives are.<br />The exhaustive research, enduring interest in the topic, and guaranteed future events related to this book and author are three of many reasons why this book should be on all reference bookshelves.  More importantly, Mr. Putnam challenges our assumptions and offers an important lens though which to view the social and civic habits of our co-workers, volunteers, friends, family, and, ultimately, ourselves.1995 magazine article, will be with us for several more years.
