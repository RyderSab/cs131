It's badly edited, and the writers are clearly not very blessed with the gift of writing. That alone makes reading THE LAST GREAT ACE (about Tommy McGuire) a much better experience.	2005-09-21

What you will NOT get here is any details about personal and family lives of any of the members. Not a chance. Not any particular personality traits, preferred hobbies or parallel activities (outside the realm of music). Gossip will not be featured either.<br /><br />This is a straighforward chronological account of Deep Purple history, with the author doing his best within three hunderd pages.. He was playing a losing game since the beginning, because no one can write a Deep Purple history in only 300 pages. So, I suggest to use this book as a framework to more research on your own.	2005-09-07

Ok, anyone in his right frame of mind by now has already understood that Bush has been practicing foul play all around in his war decisions. Everybody by now knows that the reasons given to go to Iraq were fake, a total lie. But Barber uses two hundred pages to sing a single song: preventive democracy is better than preventive war. Sure.

This book is a page turner. It's amazingly exciting and you will feel like you're into the cockpit of Spitfires and, later, Tempests. But some strong issues arise...<br /><br />First of all, the number of victories by Clostermann. He says he had 33. RAF official claims put him with &#34;only&#34; eleven! A great, very GREAT discrepancy;<br /><br />Second, a lot of facts are simply untrue. He says, about Walter Nowotny's death, that the German ace was a long foe of him. Goosh, ALL of Nowotny's victories were obtained on the Eastern Front, save one or two pairs, while he was flying an experimental Me-262 unit in Western Europe! Also, he said that a pilot of his Wing shot down Nowotny, when it was Mustangs.<br /><br />Also, it is a mystery why he did not tell that he was shot down over the Channel and prachuted to the water in 12 may1943. Pride, maybe?<br /><br />This new hard cover version is definitive, and Clostermann himself confess that he made a lot of mistakes, saying that he did not have the means of research to be totally correct at the time. He also attributes the problem concerning number of kills to the fact that he served in a lot of squadrons in just three months (3, 56 and 274). Strangely mising even in this new edition, was the mission when he was shot down into the Channel.<br /><br />It seems that, after losing Mouchotte and adding this to some previous discipline problems, the mood in 341 Alsace Squadron became very bad for Clostermann and that was the reason they sent him to 602.<br /><br />Also, there are some strange tales that Clostermann's ego was enormous and some strange tales of him filling claims when he had not even fired his guns.<br /><br />Anyway, Clostermann passed away in 2006 and his memoirs remain an unforgettable treasure of war literature.	2004-11-12

This book turned me into a total fan of Uris, and after that I read all his books.<br />It's a page-turner, no doubt about that, even considering the fact that you'll stop reading a lot of times, when you're feeling tears come into your eyeswith the vivid descriptions of brutality, courage, evil, heroism, doubts, murder and despari. I think this is one of the best novels ever written in all times.<br />Uris did no use the now usual habit of makin&quot; historic-fiction&quot; and giving his characters real names. He did not put Mordechai Aneilewicz as the leader of the Jewish resistance. He &quot;created&quot; Andrei. That was a wish choice, to give him more dramatic freedom without eventually hurting the memories of someone by accident.<br />A marvellous book.	2004-07-14

Well, this book practically says that there are two United States: one that existed until the end of World War II, a fair country, with a pride people who valued work, intelligence, freedom, innovation and free enterprise, and led a by a government that, basically, had a good eye for the welfare of its people and its institutions, and minded its own business.<br />Then was born the second United States: a paranoid one, controlled by its corporations and unlimited greed, fueled by the Cold War, capable of murdering a President (Kennedy), bombing foreign countries at will, killing foreign leaders, always finding new enemies to fight (first the Russians, now terrorism), forgetting all about social welfare, opting for the so-called &quot;neoliberalism&quot; and total free market. An United States that does not agree with reducing pollution and is capable of lying about the reasons to go to war to Iraq.<br />The world is not perfect, and it will never be. Maybe any country that reachs a military, economical and cultural leadership will act in mean way, I don't know (Rome, England, etc). But the fact is that, today, the the US is making foul play all around the world, and gathering some previously unknown hatred against him.<br />That's all this book tries to show, even if you like or not Noam Chomsky.	2004-06-18

Yes, the Florida electionwas a fraud.<br />About the evil IMF and the World Bank, I agree with the writer. It's plain for all to see. I just think he forgot to mention of of the reasons why so many Third World countries fell into the greedy hands of the IMF, the market and private companies: corruption. General governmental corruption in such a way that a first world country common person can not even think about. Corruption contributed in a important way to make these poor countries suffer continued deficits and go to the IMF for loan.	2004-06-14

But in this new book, I hardly found any new &quot;evidence&quot; of this that was not already portrayed in &quot;SWM&quot;.<br />And that's the problem with this book. Ok, it serves a &quot;cause&quot;, the cause of barking even louder against the Bush administration and corporative America. But Moore seems obssessed and enraged and full of hate exactly like the conservatives he despises so much. In doing so, the book became an extremely displeasant journey, with arid writing and not an inch of SWM freshness and cohesion.	2004-04-26

Basically, altough this sounds absurd, Tolkien should have given his ideas to another writer to write it! Since this was not possible, of course, I think he should have had a better editor.<br />The book has a good plot, but simply no sense of rhythm and pace.It's boring, really boring, mainly when he describes the nature and climate around the characters, OVER AND OVER AGAIN for more than one thousand pages. Also, the dialogues. They all seem totally unnatural, force, raw, even when theya re supposed to be gently and warm.. The characters, another big flaw... At one point, we simply do not care about them, because, other than being presented to the public of a repreentant of some race or king of some place, they simply are left undeveloped!<br />In short, this is the obligatory book to read, even if you're not a fantasy fan like myself.

The IMF applies the same formula for every nation that goes for him in search of monetary help, without losting one second to learn about the particular problems of that country. It's a shame.

I dont'know if Chomsky is so ignorant or a expert in Economics. The fact is that the subjects described in his book are real: profits are growing, wages are getting low, the THird World is a slave to the Monetary International Fund, unregulated and especulative capital is destroying countries all around. Everyones know that.<br />So the reviewers that say that Chomsky is a \\"liar\\", must be in the rich side of the coin, no doubt about that...<br />And to asy that CHomsky is a hyupocrite just because he writes books and then sell them, must be a joke. CHomsky do not fire employees at will. Chomsky do not play schemes behind the scenes with politicians and investors. CHomsdsky do no threat syndicates and simple workers. CHomsky never told that one should get money without deserving it and working for it. And his job is to write books. Of course he's smart enough to know that his kind of book has a determined audience, and he will write for them. No trouble about that!	2002-05-28

Simply the best book ever written about the Ripper (or, as a matter of fact, THE WHITECHAPEL MURDERS). Altough it deals a lot with reports, interviews and facts, you read it like a novel: I just couldn't put it down!!<br />Sudgen does not offer us the name of the murderer.<br />He introduces us to George Chapman as a plausible suspect, that's all, because at a certain point in time (around 1910), the main investigator of the Whitechapel murders (Abberline) was convinced that Chapman did it.<br />But Chapman was hanged by other crimes (the poisoning of three wives of him!) and never ever talked about nothing related to the Whitechapel Murders.<br />The book is fantastic, well researched, illustrating, teaching.<br />I just wonder how Mr. Sudgen must have suffered after watching the recent movie FROM HELL (with Johnny Depp playing Abberline), who was inspired by a graphic novel and displays one of the less credible versions of all about the Ripper, that of a Royal conspiracy...	2002-05-07

It seems Tolkien was mockering his readers. IT's not possible, to a book classified as &quot;fantasy&quot;, to start a trilogy in such a boring manner. The description of the hobbits' breakfast, lunch and dinner are annoying, a total waste of time, it only makes some readers (like myself) want to get rid of the little fellas!!! Then comes the endless descriptions of the sun rising, wind from the west, winds from the east, the green of the ground, the waters falling in cascade, the sun rising, the sun going down...!!! Enough!! The FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is the worst book of the three. As I see, here are the merits and flaws of Tolkien's totally overrated trilogy:<br />* MERITS:<br />1- Someone willing to write such a long book must be respected by the enormous difficulty of the taske alone;<br />2- TOlkien was really a respected English teacher and historian, and you can sense his joy in writing the book<br />* FLAWS:<br />1- The characters, all of them, are totally faceless, in the style of Frederick Forsyth's characters. We don't have any insight about heir feelings, about what's really going on inside their heads and hearts;<br />2- Tolkien clearly copied unashamedly so many points from other fables, like the Arturian legend, for example;<br />3- The endless descriptions sometimes makes one wonder that he is only gaining time (and pages), by repeating himself over and over again, like &quot; the sun was coming down, the air was heavy, the sun was rising, the air was clean and bright.........&quot;&quot; Irc!<br />I really think the complete trilogy would fit in just one 500 pages book.

I will not talk about THE HOBBIT, but just about the trilogy.

They seem all to be machines;<br />2) The environment descriptions are all over the history, suffocating it (and the reader) due to its sheer boredom.<br />3) The forces of good and evil are clearly divided. The good guys are perfect, even when they slash enemies and take delight in counting the number of bodies at their feet;<br />4) The dreadful songs are a joke. After trying to read some of them, I skipped them all all the way until the end of this nightmare of a trilogy.<br />5) I'm out of words to say how much overrated this book is.

With a hangover, ok, maybe, it's possible, it happened, but the writer (and apparently the eyewitnesses) says Pappy was really drunk! What does that mean? What is the the concept of &#34;drunk&#34;? Because I cannot accept the fact that a drunk pilot can shoot down 22 enemy planes (yes, I'm already discounting six totally unjustified claims) and still command the respect of his fellow pilots.<br /><br />A good book.

( according to French official sources quoted by the author himself ). It seems that the writer want to avoid the controversy surrounding Clostermann scores: the British ( for whom he flew during all his career in WW II ) credit him with between 11 and 15 air victories, and the French give him 33 !! Ohter than this, the book doesn't even mention Rene Mouchotte, a great leader of the first Free French squadrons in RAF - numbers 340 and 341 ( although he was not an ace ). Weird distribution of topics, because Frenchmen in the RAF have only six pages to their credit ...It seem the writer got completely lost in the vast ammount of information he probably had, and the result was this catastrophic, disappointing book !!!	2000-11-07

The writer, amongst other mistakes, made one very common in this kind of biography: at one moment, Soros is a poor Hungarian kid, going to London with his pockets totally empty; then, all of a sudden, he is accepted into  a great British College; then, all of a sudden, he's employed in the  investor's market in London, then he goes to America, according to the  author, with only US$ 5,000. Then, all of a sudden again, he's a  millionaire. No explanations, nothing. Well, about his career, the writer  is fairly imparcial, but the impression the book gave me is that Soros is a  humourless Hungarian, that never created any real jobs and only made people  that were already rich more richer !  His intentions of changing economic  life in Eastern Europe and RUssia are pathetic, and can only be seen as the  quintenssential example of world globalization, as Soros tried to make new  markets to earn more money!

We have very few dead bodies, we have no cartunistic villains, we have no global conspiracy or crazy plan. What we have is a  good history, well-developed characters (well, comparing to others  Crichton's characters...) centered about people trying to find out what  went wrong with some determined flight of some determined air company.

In  doing so, thousands (almost 50%) of RAF's aircrew perished or were taken  prisoner, with what gain? Even today the answer isnot clear. What is clear  to me is that Harris never once lost his sleep for the thousands of people  (British and German) that his orders sent to die, always under cover of  &quot;Orders are orders&quot;.

This marvellous job, written by the author based on his own diary, was made soon after WW II, and it is a great piece of literature, with emotions, showing the difficulties of the missions flown, the fear of flak,  the capability of the enemie pilots. But there is one big, very big  trouble: the alleged 33 aerial victories of the author are not recognized  by RAF historians, who put the figure in between 11 and 16 air victories.  This explains why Clostermann is almost never mentioned in books about RAF  aces. Some sources even say that he made claims for victories when he never  shot his weapons!!

In only one  volume, he sets up the reader in the real demands placed upon the Luftwaffe  even before the War, and shows the way that the German publicity machine  worked over their initial sucesses.

Scott wrote this book in 1943, while WW II was still running its bloody path.

Boyington  was a compulsive liar and a lousy Squadron commander on the ground, and his  book reflects this. It is incoherent and inconsistent from beggining to  end. I don't really know how someone may think it is &quot;the best book on  air wair in the Pacific&quot; ...	1999-07-20

Gerhard Weinberg did something I thought it was impossible to do: to give to anyone, even those who never read about WW II, a general picture of the conflict and all his different fronts. At the same time, he gave people who  read a lot about it, a book that in only one voluem contain all the  important facts. Very good!	1999-06-26

Britain's Gemmell give us in this book an alternative to a reader who seeks only a short adventure,  instead of one of his fantastic sagas. Mannanan, Elodan, Llaw, Groundsel,  all are characters that lead the reader to amazing adventures in the realm  of the Gabala, in a simple style of writing tha goes directly to the point!

This book by Mr. Bloemertz has one characteristic the books about WW II written soon after the war generally have: it lacks research. The writer never ever say the complete name of the characters (his Squadron Leader,  etc), only give us a few first names (like &quot;Robert&quot; ou  &quot;Werner&quot;). Even his Squadron number is not told to the reader.Not  one single date of events is given in the entire book! The weakest point is  when he says his friend Werner shot down a RAF Spitifire over France, and  the pilot was captured, and he says he wore the Victoria Cross. Well, only  one RAF fighter pilot won this decoration in WW II, and he was Flight  Lieutnant James Nicholson in the Battle of Britain. And Nicholson never was  shot down over France, nor been taken prisoner!!!	1999-02-17

Writer Max Brand (who died in 1944 in Italy, as a war correspondent)did a good job interviewing the members of VMF 212, in 1943,after their tour of duty in Guadalcanal, in 1942. The book is good, but not so  action-orientated like his tittle leads you to think. So , the reader must  spend time to see how were the difficulties to build the fighter strips in  Pacific, etc, which, as the book only now was published, is quite old  history for WW II students.	1999-02-08

This book by Mr. Girbig, a fantastic German historian, shows a good ammount of statistics and combat losses, but it seems to have been written in a hurry, because it's somewhat confusing at times. He never tells, for  example, the combat victories of the Jagdgeschwader he describes. The  reader has the impression that the translation was ugly done.Anyway, it's  always good to have a look on the German side of WW II aviation.	1999-01-06

The technical part is almost zero, and there's  too much room for Erich in the hands of Soviet guards and prisons. Anyway,  it gives a general portrait of Luftwaffe in the East.	1998-10-12

With an insight look through the  files, he takes us on a six-year journey of dogfights against RAF and USAAF  bombers and fighters, in a fighter group full of skilled aces and  dare-devil pilots, which, like all Luftwaffe, suffered terrible losses in  the end. If there was one such book for every famous fighter group of WW  II, history would be well served!	1998-10-12

This lead us to a point: we will never know how the outcome of the air battles over Germany would be, if the numbers were more or less equal on each side. Another thing missing in the Apendix is the number of missions flown by each pilot in the Group (at least the aces listed) and the total of casualties and prisoners of war. The good point is, as always, the reports from the pilots theirselves.	1998-02-06
