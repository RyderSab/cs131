Loved the author's second book, \\" The Lovely Bones\\" so much that I felt compelled to read her first one.  I knew a little of her background from various interviews but had no idea the full extent of her horror. <br />Her memoir is both sad and inspiring-such a young girl to be facing so much so soon. The maturity forced on her from growing up with a dysfunctional family obviously prepared her to deal more successfully with the rape. Still, the crime was horrific and her resiliance is amazing.	2002-11-12

Unmotivated to change her life, a family tragedy changes it for her in many unexpected ways. Most of this change occurs in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey (I am still floored to learn of its existence) amidst a collection of strangers. One of which (Louisa) is undergoing her own change in life.<br />Sad, funny and deeply heartfelt, &quot;Cranberry Queen&quot; made me take a long look at my own life and wonder what I can do be to more of an active participant.	2002-08-15

Never did I expect it to have serious undertones.<br />Nevertheless, the book was thoroughly enjoyable and I read it in one sitting (I was down with the flu). The story revolves around Linc, who has just moved his family cross-country so that his wife can take a new position. He decides to settle his family into their new life and becomes a househusband. <br />Linc struggles with depression as he searches for a new balance in his life. He seems to seek some sort of control which he finds in domestic duties. Between running a perfect house, cooking gourmet meals and raising a perfect daughter, this guy is supermom! <br />Thoughtful and funny, the story is a good lesson in life change for all of us. By the way, the recipes in every chapter are scrumptious!	2002-05-23

It is a wickedly fun look at the life of high society teens with nothing to do but backstab. They also party a lot and work hard at being rich.<br />Blair is consumed with jealousy when her former best friend, Selena, comes back into town. Knowing that she will no longer be queen bee, she instigates vicious rumors about Selena, which take on a life of their own.<br />The story is infused with humorous web postings from GG (Gossip Girl) dishing on everyone. The characters are ... enough but GG's take on the situation is great. I would have liked the story to end differently though.	2002-05-22

Picked up this book at the airport when beginning my cross-country flight  back home. It has been so long since I have enjoyed a.) the various legs of a cross country journey, b.) a whole book!<br />When you fly, you never really consider what flight attendants have to deal with on a daily basis. We have all heard the stories of out of control passengers and the \\"mile high club\\" but really did not pay too much attention. Elliot Hester has first hand experience as he has been a flight attendant for 16 years. The intro alone is worth the price of the book! As I was watching luggage being loaded in the cold rain, I was reading the intro in which the author reveals why he chose the profession he did. Very, very funny.<br />As for the tales, he is a master. There seems to be an abundance of obnoxious people who drink too much and think there are no rules on planes. Everything from puking everywhere to pure nakedness to just plain stupidity is recounted. He even backs up his stories with reprinted newspaper articles dealing with these types of episodes. The airline crew itself is not without scrutiny. Hester reveals some wild and crazy behavior-stuff we have all \\"heard\\" about but never believed.<br />All in all, I loved the book and hated to finish it. Hopefully, I will run into him on a flight as he apparently is still in the air. Try to read this when you are flying and you will have even more fun (p.29 has an excerpt from the pilot's announcement re altitude, etc which I was reading by pure coincidence while hearing the real thing. Pilots really do utter a lot of \\"aaaahs\\" between sentences).	2002-05-06

Nan is a nanny for G and reveals the self-indulgent, decadent world of the upper class. Talk about dysfunctional! Mrs. X, G's mom, is too busy with her social calendar and grooming habits to be bothered with the hassle of raising her son so she hires Nan to do the job. She seems to care more about proper place settings and who wears what than her young son's development and care. Just as long as he is a fashion accessory and doesn't get in the way. Mr. X is too busy making money and other women to care so it is left to young Nan. <br />The story is often hilarious with juicy tidbits of how the rich live. They are so obsessed with appearances! And their monetary habits are a hoot! However, a lot of the story is heartbreaking. Children are at the mercy of selfish, egotistical parents and we see the sad life of young G.<br />Great book and the authors are obviously well acquainted with the job.	2002-05-06

I am getting a little weary of the brit-chick formula books these days and was a little hesitant to read this one. What a nice surprise! The main character, Katie, is a ruthless little snot who would run over all of the other brit book heroines in  a limo! <br />We get to follow her kamakaze nosedive from grace, in hilarious fashion of course. All of the people in her life turn on her (deserved) and she is left without a job, friends or a place to live. Throughout the whole ordeal, she faces problems with great humor and candor. Kind of like a modern day fairy-tale with a great ending.	2002-04-25

The characters, namely Chrissie, are so self-absorbed, lack direction, have no interesting character traits and in short, are just plain dull. The whole story is supposed to be about a girl maturing and finding her way in life during her senior year. However, the story is so boring that I did not care what kind of trouble she encountered and I actually understood why her brother would be on drugs (the author should have concentrated on him-he was far more enticing as a character).<br />Save your time and money on this one.	2002-04-24

It is a story of a bug contest to determine which bug is the \\"bugliest\\" of them all. Of course Dilly, our heroine, is filled with self-doubt and low esteem but she attends anyway. Well, she proceeds to save the day but I won't reveal how it ends.<br />The story  is a great learning tool  about the different types of insects and their characteristics. Moreoever, it is filled with self-esteem and basic character education.<BR> <BR>In the back of the book, you get free bug trading cards loaded with information on the various insects featured in the story.  This book is thoroughly entertaining and educationally sound!	2002-03-23

Where was this book when I was planning my trip to Oahu?? I actually ran across it upon my return and immediately ordered it to plan my next trip.<br />This is one of the most concise and easiest guidebooks I have ever seen! It actually doubles as a great coffee table book loaded with gorgeous pictures and information on every area on the island.<br />The book literally takes you on a tour around Oahu, dividing the island's shores beginning with the South Shore. Filled with graphic organizers of parks in that particular shore to weather-it is handy to glance for quick info. A detailed  description of sites accompany pictures and info on traveling.  There is just so much info jammed in the pages, it is hard to list all of it but it is organized neatly! The maps are right on the money!	2002-03-11

She begins by going undercover and  partaking in rush festivities at UCLA-I am still laughing at the superficial nature of the whole event.  From there, we are treated to her report on &quot;quinces&quot; in the Latin culture (a very interesting twist on the sweet sixteen party) then to debutantes, girl gangs, young brides, etc. <br />Vida covers such a wide array of female rituals in the U.S., some of which I had never heard of before. Her humor is dry and witty while her observations of others are on cue. <br />I am not quite sure how my favorite section of the book, &quot;Burning Man&quot; fits in but it's a beaut! Makes me want to visit the wacky celebration.	2002-03-04

Before my vacation to Oahu, I researched the various guides to the island. Lonely Planet won over the rest!<br />Now, after my wonderful trip, I can say that L.P. really knows its stuff! You really get the nitty-gritty on traveling the island, not the typical tourist spots. The guide gave me info on lots of great out of the way locations that made this trip a gem. More importantly, it was very honest about certain locales that should be skipped (they were tour bus mecca though).<br />With the pronounciation key, I didn't sound like too much of a   mainlander. The restaurants recommended were superb and easy to find as well as the shops.<br />The maps inside the book were essential to driving around the island although to this day I cannot figure out how to get to the Punchbowl Crater (Diamond Head was fab though). I even invested in a large fold-out version of the L.P. map.<br />The first few chapters give lots of interesting history and pertinent info on Hawaiian life. Throughout the book you will find great little nuggets on various spots and background.  This really brings everything to life.<br />The L.P. guide is not your grandma's idea of a trip to Hawaii! I loved it and so will you (but you can't have mine because I am going back).	2002-02-20

This is the first novel by Barbara Delinsky that I have read and I must say that I am impressed!<br />This tale of suspense centers around Laura as she finds her perfect world shattered when her husband disappears. After many years of a marriage that she thought was  blissful, she begins to question her life and those around her. For instance, did her husband, Jeff,  meet with foul play or could he possibly have orchestrated his own disappearance? Are her friends really loyal? Is Laura, herself, as capable as she once thought?<br />As the story progresses, the web of intrigue begins to unravel, starting with the whereabouts of her husband, what he has been up to (I will leave that a secret for you to find out) and what role his brother, Christian, plays in Laura's life. <br />The story is about illusions and that they are just that-illusions.	2002-02-09

I hate books like these-you know, the ones that you start to read before bed and you can't put down.  I spent a few nights past my bedtime enjoying this tale of dating in your twenties. Actually, I am in my thirties but little has changed.<br />This is the tale of Jackie, a copyeditor in Boston searching for her true romance after being dumped by her longterm boyfriend. I just loved her acerbic take on the dating scene and her reliance on \\"Fashion Magazine Fun Facts\\" as a mantra to live by. Anyone who has ever endured an evening sitting in a bar like \\"Orgasm\\" being oogled by idiots will appreciate this book.  <br />Her friends join her on her quest for the perfect man-all experiencing romance pangs as well. The e-mails regarding a certain date named Tim are a riot! Also loved the bits from the romance novels Jackie edits (they are more like soft core porn).<br />Sarah Mlynowski is a fun author and this is a great first book. I would be very interested in reading more from her and her take on single life.	2002-02-04
US	52299423	RXQWG6WUHK8GW	0375411798	715003990	Me Times Three	Books	5	3	7	N	N	This book will keep you up!!!	I have read all of the Bridget Jones-type novels and loved them at the time. However, soon it just became cookie-cutter for a young female author to write in this genre. <br />I was a little hesitant at first to buy this book because I thought it might fall into the same category. After a few minutes skimming through the pages and reading the reviews on the back cover (kudos from Sarah Jessica Parker AND Wendy Wasserstein), I took the purchase plunge. Good decision!<br />This tale is about the coming of age of Sandy, a nice Jewish girl from New York who thinks she has her life all neatly tied up by being engaged to the love of her life, Bucky. She believes all of her \\"faults\\" will disappear and life will be picture perfect by marrying this typical 80's yuppie, a descendant from Betsy Ross.<br />The backdrop of the story is New York in the 80's and moves forward. I enjoyed revisiting the selfish, indulgent years from that infamous money -grubbing decade. A great walk down memory lane by the author.<br />Anyway, Sandy has a very rude awakening to her dream world by meeting Bucky's other fiance and then subsequently finding out there are a few others. Her world is shattered and everything she believes in is now challenged.<br />Sandy is plunged into the world of dating and career advancement, both of which she had previously never given much thought. We are the witnesses to her growth as a person, much of which takes place by trial and error.<br />The best part of the story occurs between Sandy and her college friend, Paul. He is the stereotypical party-hard, gay friend. He helps to bring her out of her shell during college and thereafter. I was not pleased, however, with how Paul ends up. I felt it was too cliche.<br />All in all, the book is very funny and thoughtful. Between events, Sandy's fairy tales are laid bare for the reader. These are even funnier and symbolic.<br />Great book and I look forward to the next one by Alex Witchel.	2002-01-30

I live near Sarasota and remember following this grisly crime in the news. It was a very shocking crime, especially since it happened in such a  nice area. The brutality made no sense until the facts started to emerge.<br />When I discovered Ann Rule's book on this murder, my curiousity was piqued.  What kind of a man was Allen Blackthorne and how could anyone hate a person so much as to have them killed?   Or better yet-how could Sheila have gotten mixed up with such an evil monster?<br />From page one, Ann Rule had me hooked. She researched her subjects-Allen and Sheila Blackthorne so thoroughly that no stone was left unturned. Once you read about his background and that of his relatives, you have a clearer picture of this horrible human.  Throughout the whole book, I kept thinking to myself that I was so relieved never to have met such a manipulative man.  Mr. Blackthorne just seemed to leave broken hearts and bodies in his path, usually without paying any consequences.<br />Sheila is just a sad victim who really never stood a chance. You keep rooting for her even as you know the outcome. A terribly sad reminder that evil does exist.	2002-01-22

It only served to get me in an even worse frame of mind.<br />I agreed with the Krank's decision at first but then felt very let down as the book continued. If John Grisham was trying to convey the spirit of Christmas, he failed in my eyes. I just thought the whole thing was a little too contrived.<br />I know the author is trying to spread his wings but this was not a good attempt. Just another commercial ploy to sell books (he got my money). Maybe he should just stick to what he does best-thrillers.<br />The shelves are filled with wonderful, heartwarming stories of the holiday spirit and those struggling to find it, this book should not be a part of them.	2001-12-22

If the book wasn't listed as non-fiction, I never would have guessed that anything so tragic could happen to a young child!<br />The book centers around Torey, the author, a special ed teacher and her new class. One of the children, Jadie, is an elective mute something that Torey by coincidence specializes in. After Jadie is convinced to begin speaking to Torey, the child begins to act strangely and divulge even stranger things. Her world is deep and very, very dark , indicating abuse of some kind.<br />Torey also gives insight into the problems of the other classmates. Their plights are deeply touching. <br />We are lucky to have teachers like Torey in the world. People who are so drawn to helping children.	2001-11-07

Yep, this one takes the cake as the funniest book of the year. AND it's nonfiction to bat. <br />It feels so good to laugh again this fall after all of the tragic events to hit us. Angela's diary of being broke is really an irreverant look at life and not letting little things, like not having money, get you down.<br />Her descriptions of various daily events in her collegiate life are just so funny you almost need diapers. I am still smiling about her take on free poetry readings. <br />Angela just hits everything dead on-you know you have thought or done many of the same things. The textbook scam is priceless.<br />Her honesty is really, really cool. She makes being broke very hip!	2001-10-24

Maybe if Sam's mother had gone into therapy herself, the book would have had a different outcome.<br />Throughout the book, you can see Sam's demise and eventual downfall but you want to hope that one of her friends gets through to her. <br />The author, who obviously knows firsthand, shows all of the dangers that await young women and how they can be taken advantage of by others just by playing their emotions.<br />A great cautionary tale for all!	2001-10-11

First of all, I am not a Motley Crue fan and have never been one. I can't even name a song. But of course, being an avid watcher of VH1 and E!, etc. I know the members and some of their &quot;history&quot;.<br />The book sounded interesting so I bought a copy and sat down one night to read. Wow! I really had a difficult time putting it down. These guys are really, really out of their minds!<br />I can't say how impressed I am by their candor. No matter what they did, they are  more than willing to take responsibility for it. They give a whole new meaning to out-of-control.<br />The writing was humorous, witty, engaging, thoughtful and emotional. So emotional at times that it was heart wrenching  when Vince describes the death of his daughter, Skylar. I got so choked up!<br />These guys get so many kudos for being embarassingly honest about their roots, behavior and image. Most stars would never be so willing to call themselves a nerd or an a--hole.<br />Reading about how they came together and reached the peak, then toppled was truly fascinating. So many stories about celebrity interactions are also mixed in, which was great! I always suspected that Pamela was no good. Also enjoyed the chapters from the managers, former managers, etc. Very interesting to get a different version of the same story recounted in others' chapters.<br />I do admit that I learned some new things about the female anatomy which I could have done without but that just adds to the story. This book really is a celebration of  talent and where it can take you if you are willing to give it your all. <br />It is really a shame that these talented guys got sucked in to a decadent lifestyle of booze, drugs and women that it ultimately affected their talent.<br />They can count me as a fan albeit a late one.	2001-09-27

What a great memoir of becoming an adult!<br />Beverly tells of growing up in a lower middle-class family and her rebellion against the traditional beliefs of her family and community. <br />Obviously highly intelligent, Beverly constantly seeks excitement and stimulation, at one point, finding herself a pregnant teen. As the traditions of the day dictated, she marries her teenage lover seeing it as a way to escape the binds of her family.<br />The rest of the book deals with a child and HER child growing up during the turbulent times of the 60s and 70s. She is constantly  in search of finding herself and improving her situation. Often, she falls into the instant traps of gratification, like a succession of nameless lovers, drugs and &quot;friends&quot;. In these, she seems to be seeking salvation and self-esteem.<br />The book is full of humor and wrought with emotion. It was very difficult to put down most times. I think we can all relate to the changes we go through as we reach adulthood. As for teenagers, what a great way to relate to the trials and tribulations of reaching maturity.	2001-09-13

Puppy Max and I are following the crate method described which is going well.<BR>I don't think I could have survived the first night without Andrea's advice. My pillow was very useful in covering my ears to the wails of Max from the crate but sure enough, he stopped.<BR>Everything from socialization (Pumba, my Bengal cat, is just enthralled with Max and took off with his dog bone last night while my other cat is still adjusting) to teaching tools to feeding is covered throughly in the book using simple language. Loved the sections in purple on every page!<BR>The positive reward system for training has already taken hold and Max loves praise for peeing out on the grass!<BR>We have just started to work on the barking lately. Can't wait until 4 lb Max grows a little so we can start the leash!<BR>Like I said, this book has been so important in my house (chewed edges and all).

Since it was nice and wrapped (which makes me suspicious) I gambled and bought it.<br />Although my &quot;family&quot; consists of two cats, a mouse and myself, I am pretty busy running my own business. <br />The intro pages before each month are typical calendar blocks, great for the month's overview. Each week is on one page with lots of room to write appointments/activities, etc. However, the cool part was the opposite page where you have a list of &quot;Things to Do&quot;, &quot;Growth and Gratitude&quot;(which should come in handy after the bills have been paid that week), and a PERFORATED GROCERY LIST!!!!! I have a purse filled with scraps of paper and post-its with items to be picked up and of course, they get lost. What a great idea to have the list in one place, next to things to do (i.e. dinner party). You even get extra ones in the back of the book.<br />If you still are not impressed, let me tell you about the stickers in the back.

I have tons of organizers, a palm pilot, tape recorder, etc. and I am still a mess.<br />In my latest foray into being organized, I found this book! Since it was nice and wrapped (which makes me suspicious) I gambled and bought it.<br />Although my &quot;family&quot; consists of two cats, a mouse and myself, I am pretty busy running my own business. <br />The intro pages before each month are typical calendar blocks, great for the month's overview. Each week is on one page with lots of room to write appointments/activities, etc. However, the cool part was the opposite page where you have a list of &quot;Things to Do&quot;, &quot;Growth and Gratitude&quot;(which should come in handy after the bills have been paid that week), and a PERFORATED GROCERY LIST!!!!! I have a purse filled with scraps of paper and post-its with items to be picked up and of course, they get lost. What a great idea to have the list in one place, next to things to do (i.e. dinner party). You even get extra ones in the back of the book.<br />If you still are not impressed, let me tell you about the stickers in the back. Pages of little ones like bill notices (with date and amount), birthday reminders. etc.<br />For those of you with two-legged kids, there is also a section for info to babysitters!<br />Try one of these out!	2001-09-04

Never have I seen a beauty book so well organized and written with the average woman in mind.<br />Living in Florida, I really appreciated the whole section dedicated to skin care and sun protection. Alot was devoted to explanations of why the sun can be hazardous as well as other environmental factors.<br />The section on makeup singled out those who are wary of cosmetics and those who are &quot;addicts&quot; (me). Lots of tips followed, all easy to master. The products listed were also readily found, nothing too funky. Color schemes thoroughly discussed and how-to's included<br />The section on hair was also beneficial with tips on what to do with different types, etc. I didn't spend much time reading these pages or the followng ones on nails (I cheat and get mine done). But then again the book is so filled with valuable information (and fun stuff) that all girls will feel more &quot;beauty&quot; powered!<br />Order a copy now-I am ordering another for my friend.	2001-08-23

Everything is covered from different types of meditation to fun ideas, like playing Monopoly. <br />Most of the ideas and tips I would never have considered but they made sense. Like turning off the tv or enjoying a trashy novel. The bit on recycling stuff you don't use made a lot of sense and encouraged me to clean out some clutter. Afterwards, I felt less stress and my house looked better!<br />Can't wait to try &quot;Do the Opposite&quot; tomorrow!	2001-08-23

This is strictly a chick book! The author basically compares adult male behavior to a male child's and as everyone who has ever been in a relationship attests, men are basically babies!<br />The second part of the book deals with how to &quot;handle&quot; your boy. For instance, &quot;For each NO you give, offer a YES in the form of a playful alternative. For instance, try saying &quot;No you CANNOT stay out all night with your friends drinking cheap beer and painting the town red. HOWEVER, you CAN stay up all night drinking expensive wine with me and painting my toenails pink.&quot;<br />Lots of fun illustrations and tongue-in-cheek sidebars fill this funny book.

The accountability doesn't stop there-you also get a checkoff list for amount of water, supplements, excercise, etc. etc.<br />I also loved the size of the journal-perfect for a medium sized purse or briefcase.<br />The beginning of DietMinder is filled with tips on filling out the pages, nutritional guidelines, serving sizes and calorie expenditure chart. There are also pages for your goals and before during and after pictures. The back of the journal gives you food facts and a place to graph your results.<br />I plan to purchase several to continue watching my nutritional habits once I achieve my target weight.	2001-08-22

This is a book full of previous work collected into a life &quot;guide&quot;.<br />The illustrations are once again, hillarious! Who couldn't smile at Eloise's antics? The &quot;advice&quot; is superb. But my favorite are the little pink colored advice tidbits on most pages.<br />I am so relieved that Eloise has not been censored by the politically correct. So many children's books are so soapy clean that you cannot enjoy them. However, all things Eloise remain classic.	2001-08-07

However, she is a trust fund New Yorker born with expensive tastes and shopping therapy at Barney's. Money is not something she wishes to deal with  on a personal level and thus uses credit everywhere.

Her best friend, India, a transsexual, guides her on ways to secure the above. They start by hiring a party-planning publicist for an over-the-hill expensive birthday party for Cat, inviting all sorts of celebrities. This is where the fun really begins!<br />Not only does she miss her own event but she misses meeting her prince! To top it off, she has wiped out her trust.<br />We follow Cat on her hillarious journey to get her prince at no spared cost. Also, she must find a JOB to support herself and her habits, including her personal style organizer.<br />The book is a funny, tongue-in-cheek joke about the excesses of the upper class.	2001-07-29

However, this particular one won out. Probably because it dealt with such a serious issue as drug addiction with a tongue-in-cheek attitude. <br />First we are witness to Rachel's self destructive demise and subsequent transport to rehab. Just when it gets serious, Keyes livens it up with that wonderful British humor.<br />My favorite section of the book is Rachel's initial take on rehab and reaction to others. Reminds me so much of the movie &quot;28 Days&quot;.<br />I don't want to go into much detail and spoil it for you but you are also privy to life after rehab.<br />In short, if you haven't read this Keye's novel yet, get going!	2001-07-19

I must admit that I have been somewhat disappointed with Oprah's choices over the past year and was reluctant to buy this book. However, I did so and couldn't put it down!!! I think this story really hits home with women who have been through a divorce. Elizabeth Berg has created a character, Samantha, who epitomizes all of the emotions associated with divorce-rejection, sadness, fear, grief, anxiety, etc. As Samantha opens her home to boarders in order to get ahead in finances (another pertinent issue), we are subject to a great bunch of characters who enable Samantha and her son Travis to survive and eventually mend. My personal favorite was Lydia. Oprah was right about this one.	2001-07-12

Ms. Lawrence really took on a challenge by finishing Susann's unfinished manuscript, written just before her death. For readers not familiar with the first or those who forgot, it doesn't matter. Lawrence has updated the characters to fit the times, of course taking some very big liberties with age, etc. No matter, it works! <br />This time, the story revolves around Anne and Neely, both trying to weather turbulent personal matters, age (they make 33-34 out to be ancient) and careers. Money and greed, of course, bring the two together after they split in the first novel. Alas, all is not neat and tidy! The story just oozes with sex, drugs, cat fights, ex-husbands, and skeletons coming out of the closet just to mention a few.<br />Once again, we are reminded that Susann paved the way for today's greats like Jackie Collins.

In this book, however, she is brutally honest about her struggle with PPD. She provides intimate details of her battle and the pressures around her. <br />I had always imagined a star such as herself would have a entourage of assistants but she doesn't. She actually runs her home and takes care of her family almost alone. This was very impressive as it lent credibility to her story.<br />As she finally sinks deeper and deeper, help does manage to come around.

Always facinated by the secret life of Saudi women, I eagerly devoured the book. Jean Sasson was given privy to the inside life of Princess Sultana and what she faced on a daily basis. The princess comes off as a woman who strives for justice and equality for her countrywomen but is silenced by the harsh rules set forth by the men. She tells many heart breaking stories of brutality by the men, including rape and physical abuse but of course they are not punished. She is completely powerless unless she manipulates males including her husband to get her way. On the other hand, she speaks of such wealth in the families and their extravangant lifestyles which include many vacations in their various homes and of shopping sprees that only one can dream of! in the end, all the money in the world cannot buy freedom and peace of mind.	2001-06-14

Just when you think that the world today is a cold/harsh place and people are uncaring, a story comes along to challenge your thinking. &quot;The Hours After&quot; is one such book. Gerda faced the ultimate horrors of the Holocaust and near death, losing family in the process. <br />When you are at the depths of misery with her, an angel by the name of Kurt comes along to rescue her and nurse her back to health. Ah, but all doesn't end so nice and neat in times of war. Instead of giving up on each other, they correspond back and forth until at long last they are finally reunited and then married. I went through a lot of tissues on this one.<br />Last year, I was fortunate enough to meet these two incredible people who by chance were signing copies of this book at a social studies conference.

True, I was a little skeptical at first because a lot of guides tend to go over my head when it comes to dealing with finance. This one was true to its word though. Divided into &quot;levels&quot; you deal with everything from your relaitonship with money to debt reduction to setting up attainable plans for the future.  Once you put things down in the journal, like history of dealing with money to assessing your knowledge of areas such as investments, you will be astonished. A list staring back at you can be the cold, hard truth. Karen McCall, however, rallies you to change your relationship with your wallet and provides a new, optimistic release on a financial life for those of us just spending away.	2001-06-12

I was intrigued by the cover and title of the book and couldn't wait to start reading. Let me tell you, it was a struggle from the first paragraph. However, I dutifully kept reading expecting the story to pick up but it never did. The characters were so boring that I started to root the bad guys on and there was very little plot to get immersed in. Stevens' writing was poor as well. I am sure she could do better. Maybe she had a great initial idea gone wrong. <br />In short, if you really want to read this book, get it out of the library if possible.	2001-06-11

Most are good but tend to focus on one aspect of the disease, whether it be the methods of dealing with it, the medical blah blah behind it or stories from sufferers. Mr. Solomon has taken all of these and then some and put them in his book. It is by far the most concise and comprehensive book on depression that I have ever read! I was  especially fascinated by the historical perspective as well as the stories from individual sufferers. The book goes into the author's own battle at great length, which automatically lends credibility since I don't think you can truly write about a subject like this unless you have actually experienced it firsthand. Lots of information on treatments, demographic data and the like. If you are a sufferer or know someone who is, get this book!	2001-06-10

However, overall, it is a wonderful book. Everything you ever wanted to know about being female (from a biological standpoint that is). Angier covers all topics thoroughly and honestly, with a bit of humor thrown in to boot. I was truly amazed at all of the information uncovered and impressed with her knowledge of women  throughout the ages. I learned so much and I guarantee you will as well. I gave my feminist mom a copy which she absolutely adores! I do recommend getting the soft cover (as well as the hard for your bookshelf) as I am sure you will be carrying it around for awhile wherever you go.	2001-05-21

Beckett is our unusual heroine who is adapting to a new school and move after losing her mother. She stumbles into a dark conspiracy and must fight for her life. The story was really twisted but enjoyable. At times, though, I had to reread several portions to keep up.	2001-05-20

All from the diaries of the author at age 11, one immediately realizes how intelligent she is and that no one could relate appropriately. Lori takes us on a journey of growing up misunderstood and how she just wanted to fit in and be loved.  One can understand how she embraced anorexia given her family's and societies' conflicting messages. Her mother sets the worst example in my opinion by &quot;closet eating&quot; and focusing so much on outer beauty. I wonder how her mother feels after reading this book. I know I was disturbed and saddened. However, Lori seems to have recovered and gone on to live a productive life. I am glad that she had the guts to share her painful memories so that we can learn from them.	2001-05-20

Finally, a book about someone fighting with her self-esteem/looks who does not conveniently turn into Cinderella at the end. Cannie is a witty, large-sized twenty-something journalist coming to terms with liking herself. She encounters several funny roadblocks along the way including a newly gay mother and an ex with an axe to grind. Every page was wonderfully crafted and I hated finishing the book.  Cannie's sense of humor is fantastic and she is a thoroughbly likeable character. One that I would love to have as a friend. I could almost picture Nifkin the weird little dog perched on my couch.	2001-05-06

I guarantee that even the most &quot;knowledgeable&quot; person will be amazed with this guide. Chock full of  sex techniques and illustrations, it also goes into considerable detail regarding extra tips on how to pleasure you and your partner. More importantly, it answers all of the questions we are all too embarassed to ask! Filled with humor and up to date medical news, you will find it difficult to put down!	2001-04-30

I have absolutely loved Diane's other books. She brings such a fresh approach to beauty in a nice concise manner. However, I was sadly under the impression that Boot Camp would be as good. I suppose it would be a helpful book if you were, let's say, 14 and just learning. But for those of us who would go for this type of book, all of the information is old news. The journal portion is really kitschy. It is almost as if she had nothing else to write about so she took stuff from her other books, threw it together and added the journal portion in line with the current trend. We have all heard about sequels never besting the original. Save your money, I'll send you my copy!	2001-04-27

Be forewarned that you will experience the gamut of emotions though! Schaeffer has the mannerisms and thoughts of cats down cold! It's almost as though she has some mystical power to interpret the language of cats. Once I finished the book, I had to look at my cats differently and wonder, is it true? Foudini's relationship with Sam the dog is one of my favorite aspects of this incredible book.	2001-04-26

I laughed and laughed until my sides hurt. The main character, Clara, is so straight forward and honest that you can't help but loving her. As a former married person, I could identify with her marital problems and her thoughts of the &quot;grass is greener&quot;. I look forward to reading more from India Knight.	2001-04-26

Geri Halliwell only demonstrates what an egomaniac she is and reinforces beauty stereotypes. She is doing her young readers an injustice talking about her bust size, looks, etc. Very superficial! And her supposed problems with bulimia were almost an insult to someone who has been struggling with it for 16 years. In short, save your money and watch Cinderella-it's more convincing.	2001-04-25

After reading this insightful book about our country's food choices, I must say that I have pretty much sworn off fast food. Almost every meal lately has been scrutinized even if prepared by myself. We are a nation of such convenience that we never question where something came from or how it was handled. I personally have gone out and purchased some cookbooks in order to gain some control over what goes into my body. This book is full of wonderful research but I don't recommend it for the faint-hearted.	2001-04-24

At last, someone's life long account of deaing with depression. I commend her for her forthright, honest account of how this illness took over her life and how she battled her way back. Depression is so difficult to describe to those who have not dealt with it on such a severe basis but Ms. Thompson describes it perfectly, especially how it creeps up then grabs hold. Society still equates depression with a weakness in character so I find it particularly brave that such a public persona would come forth with such a personal tale. I know it has given me much comfort and hope.	2001-04-24

I picked up this book one rainy Saturday and was mesmerized! George's rise from small town kid to big time drug smuggler is one story you don't want to miss! Porter has amassed an amazing collection of information on George's &quot;career&quot; advancement. The characters are better than anything imaginable and the details of the operations- Wow!

I hope the movie can do the book some justice.	2001-04-01

This book would get five stars if it would elminate two parts: the photos of the twins and most of the scary diet stories. Sia should instead have concentrated on more personal issues of why they were so deep into eating disorders and how they got help.  The nutrition advice was very helpful and I learned a great deal.

Never did I imagine that once I started the book, I would not be able to put it down until I had finished!! The format was so unique- letters to and from the character Elizabeth to/from real and imagined people. The story was like putting Judy Blume, Marian Keyes and Helen Fielding in a blender and coming out with a tale of present day adolescence.

Soon enough, it becomes an addiction as she cannot get through one day without burning a hole in her wallet.  Just her descriptions of clothing and other items are almost sensual.<br />I know all of us can relate to many of her thoughts and actions such as rationalizing unnecessary purchases and putting bills out of sight/out of mind. Her attempts to make money are even funnier. Even when she hits bottom, you still cheer her on! &quot;Confessions..&quot; is one purchase I recommend!	2001-02-14
