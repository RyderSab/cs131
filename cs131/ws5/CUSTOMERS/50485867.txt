Worth a look if you can find it.  <BR>From the back of the book; Miss Josephina Trafford was quite happy to live a safe distance from the fashionable frenzy of Regency London.  Not only was she a young lady of good breeding and even better sense, she was busy enough tyring to save her family estate, curb the extravagance of her flighty mother, and provide for the marriges of her two charming but helpless sisters.<BR>But if Josephina would not go near the temptations of the city, they came to her - in the devilishly handsome form of Lord Conniston Venables.  Venables was on an unwilling visit to the countryside, but the sight of Josephina made him eager to stay until he conquered her.  He could not imagine she could resist a man who knew so well the ways of the world - until Josephina began to teach him how much he had to learn about the ways of a woman's untamed heart.	2003-11-25

US	50485867	RPMXHI3MOH6PJ	0425184692	235273732	The Seduction	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A wonderful Georgian era romance.	A vastly enjoyable romance, which was a pleasure to read.  I'm horrible at writing plot summaries, so I'll leave that to someone else.  I simply wish to add one more five star rating, the book is that and more. <br />Another reviewer classed it as a Regency era romance.  I regard the setting as Georgian, an era that ended about the time of the French Revolution.  Juliet wears, \\"stiffened panniers\\" at one point in the story.  A pannier is one of a pair of hoops formerly used to expand women's skirts at the sides.  The fashion had ended by about 1790 and Juliet's dress is \\"five years out of fashion\\".  Regency England took place between 1811 and 1820.	2002-09-01

If you're into M/F erotica with the male on top this is the book for you.  Unlike all the other Black Lace books I've read the female lead doesn't have at it with every person she meets.  Genevieve is a lady, not some alley cat, but boy oh boy does she purr for her master!  Except for one F/F scene (arranged by her master so he can watch) every spot of sex is between the master and his slave.  That's what makes this book so good, so intense, so romantic and so bloody sexy.  It smacks of reality in this day of safe sex.  <BR>I want to thank the author for doing the master/slave storyline with a master who is not into torture, cruelty or mutilation.  Bravo!  <BR>I agree with another reviewer, out the all the Black Lace books I've read this is one of the best.	2002-07-13

I'm horrible at writing plot summaries, so I'll leave that to someone else.  I'm a voracious reader and thus far this is the best medieval romance I've had the pleasure of reading.  Nothing else comes close.  The plot, romance, wit and wealth of characters are everything I could ask for.  The nuances of daily life are so well woven into the story that if I didn't know better I would say the author actually lived in England during the 14th century.  A keeper.	2002-03-18

US	50485867	R1BKF6CFB8YLKB	0821726544	309713571	Fallen Angel	Books	4	7	9	N	N	Four and a half stars.	If there was one man Madeleina never wanted to lay eyes on, it was the scoundrel who'd seduced her fashionable young stepmother and disgraced her beloved father.  The spirited Scottish lass knew his name: Deveryn.  Then she met dashing Jason Verney, and as he waltzed her into his strong embrace and piled her with practiced charms, Madeleina forgot about scandals and betrayals.  She was too besotted to ask the young man his full name and too much in love to guess that Jason was really Viscount Deveryn, known to London as The Fallen Angel.<br />Jason Verney, Viscount Deveryn, changed mistresses more often than he changed his snowy cravat, but the profligate peer had never been smitten with love - until he met Madeleina Sinclair.  The worldly reprobate couldn't believe his reeling senses when he first kissed the mischievous young chatelaine of Drumoak Castle.  If he could trick her into a clandestine marriage, he could possess her virgin beauty and her castle as well.  He expected the spirited minx's pulse to race in response to his burning kisses, but he never guessed that innocent Madeleina could foil his devious scheme......by fair means or foul.  He never dreamed that she could capture the heart and clip the wing of her infamous, sensuous Fallen Angel.	2002-01-31

A wonderful medieval romance that I enjoyed as much for the compelling love story as I did the fact that it is well, medieval.  Romance novels that claim to be set in medieval times are more often than not peopled with 20th century characters that happen to live in a castle somewhere in England.  These characters didn't live in a castle for most of the book and I had no trouble believing in them or their surroundings.

The story is original and the romance bit was lovely.  I'm  not a writer so read the back of the book or one of the other reviews if  you want to know what it's about.  <br />Apparently it's the author's 1st book  &amp; it shows in a few places.
