US	51743504	R1BYOD5H1C00P9	0789401851	419840421	Science Fiction: The Illustrated Encyclopedia	Books	5	7	7	N	N	A tremendously informative reference work.	This is an excellent reference work filled with information and superb pictures.  The bios of noted science fiction uthors are especially interesting and helpful.   This book has numerous minor problems, though.   There is a blizzard of unnecessary commas that hurts the rhythm of the  sentences.  Many sentences are so parenthetically convoluted that Faulkner  will seem like a minimalist in comparison.  The page layouts are so poor in  some cases that you're not sure if you're reading text or captions to the  pictures.  The author gives an excellent definition of cyberpunk, then  contradicts himself by calling Dickens and Dostoevsky early cyberpunk  authors.  By Clute's own definition they are Punk but definitely not Cyber.   Finally, the many different type sizes may give you a headache.   Even  with the minor problems this book is still easily five stars.	2000-03-27

Even the cover of this book is great, as it illuminates the highly discussed snaking  sidewalk in &quot;Shiloh.&quot;  The commentaries on the stories are gems  as well, letting you inside the writer's mind.  Wonderful book!	2000-02-25

This is actually the first book of a trilogy entitled &quot;The Sword.&quot;  The Ring and The Chalice will come later.  This book is richly imagined, masterfully plotted, and superbly executed.  It is not  just good, it's George R. R. Martin good!  There is some familiar ground  here (after all, it's a fantasy) but there is also a great deal that is  fresh.  Exciting and highly recommended. If you are familiar with Ms.  Chester's &quot;Shadow&quot; trilogy, then you know to expect great action  scenes and lots of twists and turns.  You'll find more of the same here,  but even better!  One minor complaint: this book would be better (in my  opinion) as a one-volume 1200-page doorstopper fantasy rather than being  spread out over the next 18 months (or whatever) in three volumes.  A+++.	2000-01-27

It has a reputation as a &quot;tough read,&quot; but the effort is more than worth it.  You will come to KNOW these characters.  The ambience of  the story is as superbly rendered as the characterizations, and the  &quot;you are there&quot; texture of the book is felt with intensity.  There are no quotation marks in the speech, so sometimes it's difficult to  tell if the character is talking or if it's internalization.  Remarkably,  this adds to the power of the book.  As a reviewer noted earlier, there's a  dream-like quality to the prose that would have been diminished by adding  quotes.  The author breaks some rules by changing point-of-view, tense,  and person, yet it all works so well that it does not detract in any way.  You may find yourself drifting away at times; not out of boredom, but  because Kantor makes you think about what you've just read.  If you have  ever lost a friend or family member in a war this story will be painful.  It is emotionally charged (excuse the cliche) to the highest possible  point.  I agree with most readers that &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; and  &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; and &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; are five-star  novels, but &quot;Andersonville&quot; is on another level.  Thirty stars,  perhaps.  You'll nevr forget Ira and Lucy and the men (and women) of  &quot;Andersonville.&quot;	2000-01-19

Aside from a little story about an earthquake that I just didn't get, I though this book was absolutely superb.  The first story, called &quot;Runaway Horses&quot; (I think) had more action and insight than most  500-page novels.  One reviewer said that Blake loves violence.  I think the  opposite is true.  I believe he abhors it, and that's why he writes about  it with such passion.  This isn't like a sugar-coated news story.  Instead,  it's blood and guts and heartbreak and every emotion that goes with  tragedy.  It's like reading Cormac McCarthy after a careful editing by John  Steinbeck to make every sentence glass smooth. A+++++	1999-04-21

I wouldn't have known about this book without running across it while surfing amazon.com.  It is a brilliant novel about the battle of Nashville told in powerful prose.  It takes a little while to get used to Jones's  style, as the sentences frequently run backwards, but by page 45 you know  that you are reading a great book, and the style becomes lyrical and  rhythmic.  The defense of slavery may irritate you, but remember that this  is FICTION told through the eyes of a SOUTHERNER who witnessed the war as a  child.  A+.	1999-03-15

After I finished the novel, I got out the encyclopedias to learn more about  Theodoric and his times.  Absolutely amazing book!  My only complaint is  that the novel got a wishy-washy review in The New York Times Book Review  that probably scared away a lot of readers.  Not his hard-core fans, but  the ones who know little or nothing of Jennings' great books.  It's too bad  that one mis-directed soul can have such a big influence.  This book is  A+++.	1999-02-27

This is typical Greg Matthews, which means that it's superb.  This story begins in pre-WWII Australia, but it's mostly a war story, with an especially vivid rendering of a prisoner-of-war camp.  There are about 30  pages near the beginning that don't work (no conflict, no action, no  nothing) but the rest of the novel is so great that it has to get five  stars.	1999-01-21
US	51743504	R3KNT3PVA915M0	0451177010	844137124	Shaman	Books	4	4	4	N	N	A wonderful novel of 19th century medicine and life.	Rob Cole is back, or at least his ancestors seven centuries later.  A great read with a strong narrative, even though there are minor historical errors.  I would have give this book five stars except that the word  &quot;had&quot; is used 1,875 times too many.  This writer needs an editor!   This is often called a &quot;Civil War Novel,&quot; but the war plays only  a small role.  It's a romance filled with some unforgettable characters, a  treatise on deafness, a sympathetic look at the plight of Indians, and a  look at 19th century medicine (scary).  You'll really like this book, and  maybe even love it.	1999-01-21

Everytime you think you know what's going to happen to Caelon, there's a twist.  He's much more believable than Richard Cypher or Randal 'thor because he's much more flawed and human.  The hand-to-hand combat scenes  are incredibly vivid and well-rendered.  You'll really be surprised how  good this book is since it's not nearly as famous as many contemporary  fantasies.	1999-01-20
US	51743504	R13LQY7G41H6A6	1568496966	609609353	The Journeyer	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A superb historical novel that is one of the best ever.	This is a fictional account of the life of Marco Polo.  For 1000+ pages you'll be enthralled by one of the greatest adventure stories of all time.  Mesmerizing, without a boring page or even a clanking sentence.  A  masterwork!  Deserves 15 stars.	1999-01-20
US	51743504	R1UF6SSWN93BPD	0451067312	318706270	Mothers and Daughters	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Evan Hunter's masterpiece.	This is the story of college buddies and what happens to them over the years.  I haven't seen a copy in over 30 years, but I remember Matthew and Amanda and Gillian and David like it was yesterday.  Hunter's usual silky  smooth prose without the porno element that permeates his work today.   Hollywood and actresses and family life and college years and Van Heflin's  horse (you gotta read it to &quot;get&quot; it).	1999-01-18

This is a fictionalized account of the life of John Wesley Hardin told by those who &quot;knew&quot; him.  You're hooked immediately in the superb narrative, as the author takes many voices and pulls no punches.  I have  purchased many copies of this book and given them to friends, all of whom  loved it.  A+++++.	1999-01-18
US	51743504	R1G3NQA73Q14D7	0060179694	383678304	Power in the Blood	Books	5	19	19	N	N	A magnificent novel of the Old West.	This is a superb novel--original, compelling, fast-paced, and guaranteed to please.  Mathews is the most underrated novelist on the planet.  &quot;Heart of the Country&quot; is equally good, which is saying a lot!  I  have had three people read this novel and all rated it &quot;incredibly  good&quot; or words to that effect.  If Stephen King and Ed McBain got  together to write the epic 1,000 page Western, it might be &quot;Power in  the Blood.&quot;  Warning:  don't read the inside dust jacket, as it tells  way, way, way, too much of the story.	1999-01-18
