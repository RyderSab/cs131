The advice is completely practical, the themes are uniform and consistent, and the results speak for themselves. There isn't any miracle here, just excellent synthesis and communication of good information. No gimmicks. No tricks. And the fact that the themes are unified helps, because I found myself reading this sporadically, so the underlying unity helped a lot. I've done three centuries since getting this book. For two of them, I was able to stick with their advice. For the third, fate conspired against me, my nutritional plan evaporated, and I bonked. I'm convinced that I would have had a much better day if I'd been able to execute my nutritional plan on the bike. In addition, recovery has been faster, and I've trimmed a couple of pounds. Highly recommended if you're looking for fundamentally sound advice about how to make cycling work even better for you.	2005-08-23

The other half is about Magnuson's life and personality, and that part is not as coherent or interesting. So, set your expectations at that level, and you'll be fine. The part about cycling is quite good, and very much pitched at the level of the recreational cyclist (if the phrases \\"Coach Troy\\" or \\"Endurox recovery drink\\" mean anything to you, you'll see what I mean). All in all, a nice contribution that could have been better if it *had* been all about the bike.	2005-06-23

As someone who commutes in a mixed urban/suburban environment, I found the insights and advice to be very practical. Hurst's writing style is casual but brilliant, very conversational but never lacking in substance. The book is well-designed and easy to browse or read at length -- I've done both. It places many aspects of cycling (helmets, bike paths, injuries, and road protocol) in a practical perspective, updating many classic analyses along the way. Highly recommended if you find that reading/learning about cycling is part of why you enjoy cycling.	2005-02-21

It's a misunderstood breed in this world of instant gratification and self-aggrandizement -- to have someone invent something, and then not milk it for social status. Instead, here are stories of inventors who channel their ability to look ahead into many different directions, use their windfalls from patents and profits to explore new possibilities, and cope with the mix of invention -- achievement for themselves and their ideas, and dismissal from the establishment. This book puts the idea factories in people's heads in the proper perspective -- leading the parade. Well-researched, very current, and full of interesting threads woven together by good writing. Highly recommended.	2005-02-10

The behind-the-scenes stuff, the elaboration around major recent cycling events, the history seamlessly interweaving into the present, and the profiles of riders both famous and obscure combine to place this book at the HC level of cycling journalism. Wilcockson deserves a lot of credit for getting out something this good so quickly after the event. In book publishing, that's tough. Because he's reaching for a broad audience, there is a sentence here and there explaining things that most cyclists know. No problem. It's a great book. If you're a cycling fan, get it.	2005-01-18

In this companion book to the upcoming TDF, his writing style is very well disciplined, and the book is extremely readable. The book is designed to prep you for the upcoming event. The 2003 TDF is the launch point for this book, but the history of the tour suffuses the pages, as well. Sidebars are amusing and interesting, the data at the back is nice to have. Overall, a pleasant surprise, and a useful book if you want to get jazzed for the 2004 TDF.	2004-05-15

The writing style is crackerjack, the organization sound, the pace unflagging, and the author's command of the subject clear.	2003-11-15

The book is relatively slim, but there are many places where it pays to stop and ponder the implications of the preceding pages. Insights are frequent, the writing is quite clear and spare, and while the interviews could have been edited, the verbatims are interesting even when a bit meandering. An excellent book for people in the field.	2003-09-23

Book 5 is not as action-packed as \\"The Goblet of Fire,\\" but it has more menace and anxiety at its heart. Rowling's narrative style keep the pages flipping, but her frequent sprinkling of key details, crisp dialog, and rapid-fire scenes rewards -- demands -- close reading. The emotion of the advertised death in the book is real, but modulated into a bitter taste that will linger and motivate, no doubt, Harry's adventures in the next tales.<br />Cheers to Rowling for keeping her books consistently good. Even though this one is longer than the others, there is very little sign that she is an out-of-control writer (a fate others with early success have succumbed to in later, bloated books, once they could bash around their editors). I can't imagine subtracting much from this book without losing something important.<br />Now, for another wait . . .	2003-06-23

The cycling scenes are well-crafted, and the twists and turns of the plot are enjoyable, with a nice, cheeky sense of fun. The characters are also clearly drawn, for the most part, and there are funny moments for all of them. A pleasure.	2003-03-02

It captures rising stars, athletes in their prime, and fading champions equally well. Venues and situations are clearly portrayed, and the short entries make the book a pleasure to read over a period of a couple of weeks (if you're on an indoor trainer or just plain busy, or both!).

Others, more interested in watching an author continue to grow and explore his boundaries, may find a great deal of interest, and a compelling, well-told tale in its own right.	2001-11-20

However, in the hours between receiving it and reading it, I pondered the seemingly inevitable: I thought I'd be let down, and would discover a shallow book assembled by the Nobu marketing staff.<br />My passing qualms were misplaced, and I couldn't be more pleased. The writing is lucid, the book readable, the advice welcome and reasonable, the recipes clear, and the range of dishes exciting. Already, I've made 2 superb appetizers, and have a main course marinating in the fridge. Other dishes are to come. My spouse, a non-sushi-eater until a few years ago, has glowed about the dishes sampled thus far, and is anticipating many more soon.<br />This is not anybody's main cookbook (or even in the main set), but should accessorize any amateur chef's collection when in the mood for fusion food and inspired/inspiring combinations.	2001-11-04

This novel does nothing to set the atmosphere, reading more like a modified screenplay (which I'm suspecting was one of the motivations playing in Kanon's mind). The characters are poorly (re)imagined, the settings dismissively portrayed, and the writing style unremarkable. Also, I had the feeling that the author didn't work on immersing himself in the circumstances of New Mexico, WWII, or the Project. It's all too contemporary in parts (seems like it's pulled out of the 1980s instead of the 1940s). Finally, the plot is too simplistic and rather dull. A dud.	1998-03-01
