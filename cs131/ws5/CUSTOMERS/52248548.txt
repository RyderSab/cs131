The suspense she was building up made you want to know what was going to happen next throughout the entire book.

NOT!! First of all the book was dragged out far too long.  I wanted the problems resolved quicker than they were.  A lot of characters were left somewhat undeveloped and the book just seemed to be about a black man realizing he was gay which isn't exactly a genre that I am interested in. Perhaps if this subject was presented differently it may have been more enjoyable.  If you still feel you must read this book borrow it from the library or a friend.	2001-01-30

I wish that Mr. Nelson would have been more in depth in his book because I was still a child when hip hop blossomed and lived in upstate New York so I  have no firsthand knowledge of what hip hop was like back in the day.  All  I knew was what MTV allowed me to see on Yo! MTV Raps.  So for the people  who were not old enough to go to Run DMC,LL or other pioneers' concerts and  who didn't live in the South  Bronx a more in depth look at hip hop's  beginning is needed.  Also a lot of the musical industry terminology and  speak should've been elaborated  for those of us who are not in the music  industry.  Despite these shortcomings the book was still a decent read.   The quality of the book  will force me to read a more in depth book about  hip hop to fill in the blanks.  Overall  this is a good book and anyone who  claims they are interested in hip hop should read it.  To the reader who  says that if you don't play your old records or are a trendy fan  you  shouldn't read that who are you to judge anyone's musical taste and loyalty  to hip hop?   I believe the trendy fans album sales count also.   Peace	2000-01-10

The story line was WACK the way she develops the characters make sit hard to follow and these women seem to make very childish and immature decisions about their lives and the  men in them.  The most exciting part of the book was finding out that the  bulimic character's boyfriend was married and she was a pitiful one.  Then  the character who let her  work and her mother rule her life was foolish to  say the least.  There is no mention in the latter part of the book about  the recently married friend whose wedding they attended in the beginning of  the novel. Again the novel was hard to follow the end left you hanging and  so did the entire plot.  If you would like to read this book borrow it from  the library.  The quality of the plot in this book is extremely poor.	2000-01-10

The character of Bobby Dallas was somewhat realistic and I think that most women have come across someone like him intheir life the good guy who  usually gets no play, but you know that he will treat you the way you would  like or at least claim you want to be treated but in this book the good guy  seems to come out on top.
