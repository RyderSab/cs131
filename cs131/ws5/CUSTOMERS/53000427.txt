Once in a while, a book comes along that changes the way you see the world. Blink is one of those books.<br /><br />Psychologist Malcolm Gladwell explores the decision-making process of the sub conscious mind. Almost as fast as the speed of light, the brain processes information, evaluates input, sorts and prioritizes data and responds with a judgment, all in the blink of an eye. As humans, we are constantly, unknowingly, making snap decisions every minute we are awake.<br /><br />If we could slow down time to its smallest elements and study ourselves in the process, we might understand more clearly how and why we make the decisions we do. In the knowing of how that works, might come a better understanding of how to make more informed, more thoughtful, right decisions.<br /><br />Gladwell looks at married couples, police officers in the line of fire, combat troops, autistic people, and many others to grasp the complexities and simplicities of the decision-making process. Learning how we \\"think without thinking\\" may teach us how to see more clearly and critically and to make better choices along the way.<br /><br />Blink is a fascinating work.	2005-09-24

Levitt takes the toolkit of economics, \\"the dismal science\\" and applies them to interesting and provocative social questions, like shining a light into dark places. \\"Freakonomics\\" explores the relationships among seemingly unrelated events and observes them. Levitt takes some pain to distinguish the differences between correlation and causality. But the pain is worth it.<br /><br />Who'd have thought of correlating abortion and crime? Or school test scores and union negotiations? Or sumo wrestling and real estate brokers? Just as a gifted athlete makes the difficult look easy or the gifted teacher makes the complicated topic seem simple, Levitt takes intricate social messes and sorts them out.<br /><br />In the process, Levitt explodes a few social myths. His book takes commonly-held views, strains them through a truth filter and finds some of them invalidated as mere urban legends. I hope this is merely the beginning of many more incisive observations to come. An excellent read and stunningly interesting.	2005-08-24

Honest. Insightful.	Bryson captures a great deal in his walk in the woods. The candor and honesty with which he writes makes him the hero for every guy who has put on a pack. Besides, he is just side-splittingly funny. Katz, his erstwhile companion, and Bryson are a couple of characters with a story to tell.<br /><br />Middle-aged and feeling it, two urban dwellers set out to make their mark on the Appalachian Trail (AT). But this is no expert excursion, these two leave behind some essentials, take the non-essentials, and are walking pratfall for hundreds of miles along the trail. The narrative is insightful into people, politics, and the sheer enormity of the task before them.<br /><br />A Walk in the Woods slices open a section of the American experience for all to see. At great risk to his dignity and pride, Bryson lays it all out for everyone to poke and laugh at. But in the process, he becomes and everyman, himself and it is our dreams and sense of adventure he carries onto the trails, mountains, and towns he visits.<br /><br />Having hiked the AT from Katahdin to Monson, Maine, I can relate to many of their stores and adventures. It is a very special experience; one that stays with you a lifetime. This book had me wondering if my camp stove still worked and where I put my backpack.	2005-08-17

The Holy Spirit series is a must-have for faith-filled fans of Ken Hagin. Though Hagin, to be sure, would disagree and say that it is a must-have for every believer! And he would be right, of course.<br /><br />This series offers wonderful teaching on a topic few endeavor to preach- the personality, gifts, workings, and power of the Holy Spirit. He spends considerable time talking about tongues: is speaking in tongues encouraged? What is its purpose? How does it \\"work\\"? When is it appropriate?<br /><br />As is his style, Hagin's lectures all center squarely on the Bible. He draws plenty of instruction, examples, and insights for the scriptures to support his view. I find his teaching refreshing, open, honest, faith-building and power-packed. This series is no exception.	2005-08-17

Kenneth Hagin had a walk with God that was intimate, power-filled, and faith-building. When he speaks from scripture or his own life, it is compelling, insightful, and quickening.<br /><br />\\"Must Christians Suffer\\" contains scriptural answers to a thorny subject. Roman Catholics and other denominations have long taught that we must \\"pick up our cross daily\\" and enter into a certain suffering as Christ did in order to be conformed to His likeness. Suffering is good for the soul.<br /><br />To a degree, that teaching is sound, Hagin says. Jesus taught that there will certainly be persecutions and trials in this life. As Wigglesworth said, \\"Great trials bring great victories!\\" and, to a degree, the sword of our faith is whetted upon the tribultations of life.<br /><br />But Christians are not burdened to suffer disease and sickness. Why not? Becuase Jesus suffered those things upon the cross in order that we would not have to. And anything the Lord carried on our behalf, to gain the victory, once for all, need not be carried again - the atonement was sufficient. Standing upon Matthew 8:7 and Isaiah 53, the scriptures say that Jesus took upon himself our pains and sickness so that we could be healed and whole. Disease is from the enemy of our souls, not from God and there is healing from the Lord, not sickness. That battle has been fought and won for every child of God, forever.	2005-08-07

Like David Wilkerson, Rich Wilkerson, and Kenneth Hagin, he has picked up the mantle of prophet and interceeds with God for souls, cities, and nations.<br /><br />Frangipane has emerged as the spiritual drill sergeant of the spiritual warriors of our time.<br /><br />\\"Discerning of Spirits\\" is a simple, short summary of key principles regarding the oft-misunderstood gift of discernment. In \\"The Three Battlegrounds\\", I think, Frangipane writes that \\"discernment without love is merely critical judgement.\\" And he picks up that theme here. Like the other gifts of the Spirit, discernment operates in love. Anything less is hypocrisy and nothing more than a critical judging spirit.<br /><br />In the end, our pursuit is being conformed to the image of Christ: \\"Christ-likeness is the goal, not warfare.\\" Frangipane gets it right and this booklet is a helpful reminder of the important guideposts along the journey.<br /><br />His signature theme on the topic of spiritual warfare is: \\"Victory begins with the name of Jesus on our lips. It is consummated by the nature of Jesus in our hearts.\\"<br /><br />Note: This is a 26 page booklet - useful for Bible studies - not a major text on the topic.	2005-07-16

Life-Changing.	\\"How to Write Your Own Ticket With God\\" is a step-by-step recipe to receive provision, protection, and blessing from God. In 1953, Jesus appeared to Kenneth Hagin in a vision and spoke to him saying, \\"If anybody, anywhere will follow these four steps they will receive anything they want from me or from God.\\"<br /><br />This astounding promise is a simple, basic lesson in saying, acting, and receiving what we want from God. Hagin writes this lesson in detail, clearly and concisely so that anyone can follow it. It seems remarkably simple (just like the Lord) and yet it is profound.<br /><br />Always a stickler for the Word, Hagin asked the Lord to reference Bible scripture to support the four-step process. A brief study of the woman with the issue of blood (Mark 5), the parable of the prodigal son, and the story of David and Goliath all exactly follow the steps the Lord gave to Hagin.<br /><br />This is truly an exciting lesson for the believer - there is tremendous opportunity, power, and potential waiting for every believer in this teaching.	2005-07-10

Kenneth Hagin sets the record straight on doctrinal errors such as, \\"naming your seed\\", \\"100-fold\\" returns on offerings, preachers' \\"special anointing\\" to bless and multiply offerings and several other misguided teachings. As Hagin describes, church doctrine is a road with ditches on both sides. Extremism on either side of the issue will end up off track and out of the way.<br /><br />For the Christian, there is a danger lurking in some prosperity teachings of losing our first love; of chasing after the things of this world instead of chasing after God. There is need for a certain degree of maturity in the believer to handle the prosperity doctrine. The properly balanced Christian loves the Creator more than the creation. \\"Love not the things of this world\\" we are cautioned in 1 John 2:15.<br /><br />Yet, our hearts lead us astray. Our affections for this world would charm us still.<br /><br />There is good news in the Midas Touch. God desires \\"above all things\\" that his children prosper and be in good health. There is provision, protection, and riches in glory of Christ Jesus in great abundance for us today, in this life. We are well able to access the power of God through faith. There is healing, prosperity, and blessings beyond measure for every believer.<br /><br />Hagin was no Scrooge. Nor was he a fool. With revelation, knowledge and wisdom he clearly saw the road ahead and warns us today \\"that narrow is the way which leads to life\\" and not to fall into the ditch, on either side, along the journey.	2005-07-10

This review refers to the audio tape version.<br /><br />Listen in as Kenneth Hagin takes his class at Rhema Bible School through a course on the healing anointing! Using scriptures proving the existence of the healing anointing. He draws from his personal experiences through decades of ministry and builds a powerful and persuasive case.<br /><br />Hagin describes his encounter with Jesus who anointed his hands to heal and charged him with a special ministry to the sick. Whether demons are to blame or the illnesses of a fallen world have taken hold, both must disappear under the healing anointing of God.<br /><br />For those ministering in faith, not having yet received the healing anointing, there remains power in the word of God to heal and to deliver. The results may differ in intensity and take slightly longer to manifest, but faith will get the job done.<br /><br />These lessons are invaluable to Christians willing to believe God's Word. Using the story of the woman with an issue of blood as a type, Hagin launches into a full course in healing by faith. The lesson is rich in personal stories and experiences which bring the bible verses to life. Hearing Hagin laugh and tell stories as well as praising the Lord and encouraging his class of believers is priceless for those of us who are learning from him after his death.	2005-06-30

Scriptural.	\\"Reigning in Lifa as a King\\" is another of Hagin's teachings regarding the believer's position as a \\"son of God.\\" Drawing on Galatians 3, he explores the rights, privelages, and responsibilities sons (and daughters) enjoy. But more than that, he lays down step by step, the promise that believers shall reign as kings in this life.<br /><br />Much of this series is based on Romans 5:7 which says, paraphrased, that through Christ believers are given the privelage and authority to reign as kings in this world. But how few Christians see themselves as sons of God, much less kings! If the church should discover the fullness of these promises, \\"spiritual giants would walk in the land.\\" For those who are ready to receive their inheritance, there is grace, power, provision, healing, and victory now, in our lives.<br /><br />Hagin recalls the story of Charles Spurgeon visiting an elderly woman living in abject poverty. Hanging on her wall, framed, was a will from her former employer, a noble Englishwoman, bequeathing her a house and income for life. Not knowing how to read, the impoverished woman had never claimed her inheritance and instead lived a life destitute and impoverished.<br /><br />Such is the picture of many Christians today; unaware of their inheritance from God. Christians, the Bible says, are \\"joint heirs with Christ\\" and will recieve of the glorious riches in Christ Jesus.<br /><br />Kenneth Hagin was an anointed teacher and preacher. His teachings are a journey higher and deeper than perhaps any other modern pastor. His writings and recordings are now a legacy of wisdom on healing, anointing, prosperity, grace, faith and many other topics of interest to all believers.<br /><br />This is a book for those who want more from God. Who want to aim higher, reach further, and recieve the fullness of all He has for His children of faith.	2005-06-18

Compelling.	In \\"The Case for A Creator\\", Lee Strobel sets out to \\"investigate scientific evidence that points toward God.\\" This is not an exhaustive treatment of the historical point of view, rather an examination of modern-day evidence which increasingly affirms the intelligent design of an intelligent designer.<br /><br />Ever since Darwin wrote Origin of the Species in 1859, the realms of science and faith have been separated by hostility and distrust. As Strobel asks, \\"Are science and faith doomed to always be at war?\\"<br /><br />Science distrusts the realm of faith which does not easily yield to the scientific method. God does not perform on command. On the other hand, science is limited to observable and measurable phenomena and devoted to the merely natural. It takes no account of the supernatural.<br /><br />To quote Jonathan Wells, PHD, PHD, an expert in geology, physics, Darwinism, with a doctorate in molecular and cell biology, \\"I think people who believe that life emerged naturalistically need to have a great deal more faith than people who reasonably infer that there's an intelligent designer.\\" In other words, it takes more faith to believe in evolution than to believe in God. In fact, I would go one step further, all of these scientists have faith; the question is, what do they have faith in? Who are their gods?<br /><br />The central question which Strobel posits is this: Is \\"belief in a supernatural God consistent with what science is uncovering about the natural world?\\" To find the answer he interviews leading experts in the fields of physics, cosmology, astronomy, biochemistry, biology, and philosophy.<br /><br />Many readers will be delighted to see the last remnants of the tattered evolution mythology finally shredded. The distortions, deceptions, and lies of the long-established view held by most of the scientific community have been revealed in phony artifacts, altered experiments, and deliberate distortions of the truth. For decades, the scientific community has bullied believers with Darwinism and its ill-fated stepchildren of evolution, natural selection, and cosmic chance. Serious scientists of faith have been threatened by ridicule and ostracism.<br /><br />But today there is scarcely a believer in Darwinism to be found! Now for the high school and college text book writers to catch up.<br /><br />As science advances and we more closely examine the universe, from the cosmos to DNA, a resounding chorus declares the glory of God. From fine-tuning to \\"irreducible complexity\\", the mounting evidence of intelligent design reveals the fingerprint of God, the creator of heaven and earth.ific community has bullied believers with Darwinism and its ill-fated stepchildren of evolution, natural selection, and cosmic chance.

Have you ever wondered what God's will was in a certain matter, in a tough moment, or for your life? Wouldn't it be great to hear from God to know His best for you? When and how does God speak? How can I hear HIs voice? Hagin sets out to tackle these very questions.<br /><br />Basing his teaching on scriptures such as Proverbs 20:27, Hagin teaches that God is constantly communicating with us, from the inside out! Learning to listen to the \\"inner voice\\" or the \\"inner man\\" is learning to listen to God. The Holy Spirit is always guiding, prompting, and leading believers into the truth. Sometimes our hearing skills need improvement and there is help from the Holy Spirit.<br /><br />The Lord will also use visions and revelations to communicate. Sometimes taking the form of a revelation to the believer only; i.e. Paul on the Damascus road. Other times it may occur as a trance such as happened to Peter in Acts 8. Or it might come as an \\"open\\" vision with the believer fully engaged in an eyes-open, face-to-face meeting with the Lord. Hagin describes personal experiences which illustrate each of these occurrences in his life and ministry as well as in the New Testament.<br /><br />Hagin teaches that the voice of the body is feeling, the voice of the soul is reason, and the voice of the spirit is the conscience. Few preachers draw such clear lines of understanding among the body, soul, and spirit. The churches, to the extent they teach this truth, tend to confuse the merely soulish with the spiritual. The three are distinct and important to properly understand.<br /><br />Listening to Brother Hagin is like sitting at the feet of a wise uncle or grandfather, soaking in wisdom, insights, and revelation from a life spent walking with the Lord. I love his teaching and am well fed by this spiritual food.	2005-06-11

Frangipane has a burden for America. And America is under attack. But the church is not advancing against the enemy. Introspective and self-involved, the church has a spirit of passivity about her.<br /><br />Even in the aftermath of 9/11, the church has not responded with a sustained, courageous, persevering spiritual attack against the enemy. Some beleivers treat God more \\"like a bartender than the Lord of Hosts!\\" We tell him our problems, await his sympathetic response and we go on our way unchanged, no better or stronger for the encounter.<br /><br />But that is not our calling: The Lord of Hosts is calling believers to wage warfare: to fight! And the weapons of our warfare are mighty through God. (Eph 6:12). \\"The church in America is throwing off indifference and apathy and rising, at long last, to her feet.\\" (p 166)<br /><br />Frangipane calls upon believers in America to answer the call to arms. To wage war against oppression, tyranny, demonic control, principalities and all the powers of the enemy. He calls the church to stand tall: \\"This day we fight!\\" And then the Lord will come. Even so, come quickly Lord Jesus.<br /><br />The author is well known for his work and anointed teaching in spiritual warfare.

I prepared a series of Bible studies on the parables of Jesus and wanted supplemental material to add to my understanding and class lectures. Specifically, I was interested in Jewish traditions and cultural insights that would add color and clarity to the stories.<br /><br />I purchased three books, including David Wenham's \\"The Parable of Jesus.\\" I am not a Bible scholar and not particularly interested in theological debates over allegorical loose ends and old disputes over linguisitc fine points that other books were consumed with.<br /><br />This book provided me exactly what I needed - clear, concise insights into the culture, traditions and context of the times. For example, in the Prodigal Son, Wenham pointed out that by asking his father for his inheritance while the father was still living, in the meaning of the legal traditions, the prodigal was actually implying that he wished his father dead.<br /><br />In the parable of the Good Samritan, he observes that the road from \\"Jericho to Jerusalem\\" drops 2,500 feet along a treacherous and winding path; ideal for robbers and thieves to hang out. Further, he points out that \\"two denari\\" was enough money to pay for twenty-four nights at the inn.<br /><br />These details helped me to put meat on the bones of the story and bring to life these precious parables. These are not earth-shattering biblical truths, but they were very helpful to me in making the topic interesting and relevant. Just like Wenham's book.	2005-06-05

As a divorced and remarried Christian, I believe that this issue is one of the most hurtful, prejudical, and sensitive facing the church today. Many believers have faced  discrimination, shunning, and church \\"disipline\\" from pastors and churches trying to adhere to godly standards. Unfortunately, they end up enforcing mere \\"traditions of men\\" rather than God's will, to the detriment of the souls affected and to the body of Christ.<br /><br />Robert Eldredge Sr. takes great pains to explore the biblical covenant of marriage, the desire of God for strong marriages, and the history of the institution. And then he lays a scriptural foundation, verse upon verse, of God's instructions to believers, not man's interpretation, about separation and divorce. Out of this sound and sensible approach arises clear and compelling wisdom concerning marriage, divorce, and remarriage.<br /><br />One of my favorite insights is, \\"It seems only common sense that divorced and remarried Christians should be allowed the same privelages of serving our Lord Jesus Christ in ministry that is already allowed those who used to be thieves, murderers, adulterers, fornicators, drug dealers, rapists, gang leaders, and the like!\\" (page 155)<br /><br />More than his opinion, however sound, Eldredge bases his conclusions on God's Word. He closely examines what the scriptures say about remarriage: under what circumstances, when, and how. I saw Jeremiah 3:8 in a new light when he explained that God Himself divorced Israel for \\"infidelity\\".<br /><br />Throughout the book, Eldredge is understanding of the issues  and compassionate toward those struggling with them. He is neither heavy-handed nor permissive. This book delivers a fair, honest, and candid treatment of a very difficult topic.<br /><br />If you or someone you love struggles with issues of separation, divorce, or remarriage, this book has Godly answers for them, delivered in an intelligent and loving way.	2005-06-01

Given the state of the Social Security system combined with 73 million baby boomers stepping into retirement, this manual couldn't have come at a better time.<br /><br />David Bach has taken basic, proven investment and savings techniques, bound them together in one easy-to-read manual, and produced a book of financial truths and techniques for everyone.<br /><br />The power of systematic investing is well-documented and proven; Bach calls it the \\"latte factor\\": the systematic investment of small amounts of money over time. His spin is to automate your highest financial priorities. If retirement is your top priority, for example, automate that choice by having funds invested into 401k's, IRA's, and other plans faithfully, without having to make a recurring, monthly decision. Human nature is such that if I have to repeatedly make a decision to set aside funds for a long-term goal, in the face of short term pressures and priorities, the long-term goal will eventually lose out. He is right.<br /><br />As a \\"younger\\" boomer in his late forties, I take comfort in Bach's strategies; there is still time for them to work in my life. I have already executed many of them.<br /><br />Warning: If you are already 60+, you might not have enough time before retirement to fully harvest the seeds Bach recommends planting.

Rich Dad is surely an entrepeneur with a lot of common sense but he is not a prophet. He may be worthy of respect, but not worship.<br /><br />Kiyoaki's writing style is mind-numbingly repetitive and taunting - continually hinting at the scret-he-is-about-to-reveal and never quite delivering on that promise.<br /><br />ERISA has influenced companies to change from defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans but the real driving force is not conspiracy - it's financial: defined benefit plans are very expensive and place a tremendous fiduciary responsibility on the company. 401k plans and other defined contribution plans are less expensive to administer and put more of the financial liability on the participant, instead of the company.<br /><br />Now this is neither evil nor disastrous in itself. It is up to each investor to fully participate in and wisely manage their 401k plans. Just because the Baby Boomer generation will be retiring does not in and of iteself mean a meltdown in the capital markets. Although it will certainly cause some big changes!<br /><br />For a more complete treatment of this topic in a rational, studied manner, I recommend Harry S.

Books	3	9	14	N	Y	Mixed Review	Kiyosaki is right about two things:<br /><br />1. Financial education in America is woefully inadequate. Parents need to educate themselves so that we properly educate our children - the schools just are not doing the job. Our kids graduate college with virtually no knowledge about investing, personal finance or practical economics.<br /><br />2. As consumers we tend to gather liabilites instead of assets; especially income-producing assets. We need to start with personal financial statements and balance sheets and really plan for our financial future; especially retirement.<br /><br />This book couldn't come at a better time. The Social Security system is bankrupt according to its Trustees. Yet, we have a middle class largely underprepared for retirement or taking control of their own financial future.<br /><br />However, Kiyosaki has a most annoying writing style. He dangles I-am-about-to-tell-you-the-big-secret in front of the reader and then delivers small nuggets of common sense that are a lot less than the hype.<br /><br />I disagree with Kiyosaki about the meaning of life- a life spent chasing riches in this world is empty and unsatisfying - merely chasing the wind. He seems to regard the acquisition of wealth as an end in itself. There is meaning to life when understood through the eyes of our creator and Father. God has the ultimate answers to our questions and the promise of a more abundant life.<br /><br />Rich Dad was not a prophet - just a hard-working entrepenuer with more common sense than most.

Then deeper truths are explored including: the anointings of God, creative power of the tongue, the glory of God, and working miracles.<br /><br />Reading these wonderful testimonies and teachings, I am reminded of the work and teaching of Smih Wigglesworth. There are so many similarities betwen the two: a powerful faith, healing ministries, absolute conviction in the power of God to perform His word in the Here and Now.<br /><br />Hagin stirs the faith of believers. He challenges us to believe God. To stand upon His word and act accordingly. The power of the Holy Spirit is as much for us today as it was 2,000 years ago. I am grateful for this book and this brother who now walks with God.	2005-03-26

If anyone has ever doubted God's will to heal everyone who asks, this is the book to read.<br /><br />Relying solely on the Word of God, Bosworth clearly makes the case for divine healing. Page after page, the evidence mounts until the reader, at some point, relents under the weight of that evidence and says. \\"I believe!\\" When Christ suffered and died on the cross, He bought our salvation and our healing, once and for all.<br /><br />If Smith Wigglesworth were alive and read this text, he would surely exclaim, \\"Amen!\\" At any rate, I'm glad Kenneth E. Hagin did read Christ the Healer and pointed me to it.<br /><br />There are some extras in this edition: 22 Reasons Why Some People Aren't Healed, Testimonies, and Thirty-One Questions about divine healing.<br /><br />This is more than Christian classic - it is a field manual for daily devotions, warfare and victory.	2004-11-19

Leave it to Kenneth Hagin to provide a well-researched, authoritative answer to the question which has plagued the church for generations: \\"What does God say about divorce and remarriage?\\" This is the best piece of research, analysis, and scriptural insight on this difficult topic which I have seen, and I've seen a few.<br /><br />My wife and I had been divorced and we got married in 1999. Our church refused to marry us. They have refused to ordain me or allow me to achieve any pastoral certification in the denomination. They required my wife to step down from ministry for a year. Since then, they have twice changed their \\"law\\" on the topic. I no longer try to keep up with their shifting sands.<br /><br />But now, there is good news for every believer: \\"there is now therefore no condemnation in Christ\\"; especially not from your \\"pastoral staff\\" or your church. Paul writes in 1 Corinthians about the perfect \\"law of love\\" and Hagin fully describes this principle and applies it beautifully and convincingly to this topic.<br /><br />Good news! The answer is liberating to evey believer who loves the Lord. Wouldn't you know? Just like Jesus!<br /><br />This book goes beyond the divorce and remarriage question and tackles issues important for a healthy marriage, advice to people facing marriage, and lots of anecdotes and stories which will warm your heart and inspire you.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this book to everyone seeking the Lord on these topics.	2004-11-13

This little book is a blockbuster!<br /><br />It is packed with scriptural insights which will increase your faith and change the way you approach the throne of grace. The Lord does not want His children to be covetous. Nor does He want them to be lacking for those things they need and want for their lives and for His work. \\"The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want.\\"<br /><br />The children of the king are not beggars. But there is one who comes to steal, kill, and destroy. Over the enemy the Lord has already provided victory - triumph! Hagin declares war on the enemy of our souls, our families, and our God. So do we as believers and make a claim of faith in the goodness, graciousness, and mercy of our God.<br /><br />All of heaven and the riches in Christ Jesus are at the disposal of the believer. What a change this knowledge will make in the lives of the faithful!<br /><br />Hagin is not indulging in some private interpretation but is illuminating the Word of God in truth and in power for all who would believe.	2004-11-12

Harry Dent has made his reputation writing about the economic effects of the Baby Boom generation. Everything this generation of 73 million people has touched, has been changed. As this group has grown up, had children and now, begin to retire, they have changed the market conditions, products, and services for their generation.<br /><br />Their buying, consumption,and investing habits are fairly predictable. By analyzing their tastes, needs, and preferences and making some simple economic assumptions, we can see with a high degree of predictablility, certain market patterns emerge.<br /><br />Dent predicts that between 2005 and 2009, we will see:<br />Dow Jones of 30,000 - 40,000<br />NASDAQ - 12,000 - 15,000<br />Inflation - 3% or less<br />Interest Rates: lower than current levels<br />Strong economic growth<br />Investment Sectors: Financial Services, Health Care, Technology, selected interational markets<br />Strong growth in certain real estate markets<br /><br />Whether you agree with a DJIA of 30,000 or not, this work is persuasive, thought-provoking, and compelling.

Then things began to change....!<br /><br />Jesus healed Hagin of his crippling ailments and he began his new life - called to preach the Gospel and teach about salvation, healing, and the mercies fo the Lord.

It is at the throne of God. Hagin encourages the believer to approach our enthroned Lord there to seek mercy and grace at our time of need. And to find it in rich, generous supply, flowing from Him to us by the Holy Spirit. Whether the need is for healing, revelation, teaching, preaching, or spiritual gifts, the Lord has an abundant supply and is willing and faithful to give it to those who ask for it.<br /><br />God also gives special anointings to accomplish special purposes on the earth. Hagin describes these annointings, the fivefold ministry gifts, and how to handle the anointings of the Lord.<br /><br />A \\"stickler\\" for the Word, Brother Hagin carefully delivers scriptural reference to back up his insights. It is a powerful, faith-building study full of personal experiences and testimonies which will thrill the believer.<br /><br />This is solid work from a gifted, insightful, anointed prophet of God.	2004-11-08

Through access to the throne, the Christian believer has an inheritance in this world and the next, from the treasury of Christ Jesus. An inheritance of peace, joy, strength, health, power, provision, love and much more. Hagin encourages the believer to \\"enter in\\" and receive all the fullness of God.<br /><br />There is power in the tongue - even life and death. And the spoken word from the mouth of the Christian is powerful and pursuasive. Power to bless, to heal, and to overcome the evil one in the name of Jesus.<br /><br />Throughout this interesting and powerful book, I was reminded of the teachings of Smith Wigglesworth and felt agreement in my sprit, as well.

In the spirit of Og Mandino, Andy Andrews outlines seven principles for successful living:<br /><br /> 1. The Buck Stops Here - Taking personal responsiblity<br /><br /> 2. Seek Wisdom - Search for understanding and discernment<br /><br /> 3. Be a Person of Action - Being a courageous leader<br /><br /> 4. Have a Decided Heart - Overcoming double-mindedness<br /><br /> 5. Choose Happiness - Possessing a grateful spirit<br /><br /> 6. Forgive others - The power of grace and mercy<br /><br /> 7. Persist - Perservering with faith until the end<br /><br />Using historical personalities (Lincoln, Anne Frank, Truman) and events (Civil War, Holocaust, World War II), Andrews draws powerful lessons from the past to inspire today's reader. This is not a particularly \\"Christian\\" book. Believers and non-believers alike will see the wisdom and usefulness of the seven decisions and their related stories. While there is an undertone of faith, the book is not certainly not a \\"religious\\" book in the traditional sense.<br /><br />If you liked the Og Mandino collection, you'll really love this.

The search must start with Him and His purposes and, in that context, we find meaning, wholeness, fulfillment and purpose.<br />The basic tenents of Christianity are clearly explained and simply stated - a tremendous resource for those new to the faith.<br />Beyond that, however, the author runs out of gas. If he is walking in the gifts, fruits and fulness of the Holy Spirit, he doesn't write about it. The third person of the trinity is strangely absent and so are the power, gifts, and personality of the Holy Spirit. Not to mention the wonder-working power of God.<br />Instead, Warren pulls out a how-to-be-a-good Christian recipe that is one part small group, two parts church. With echoes of Hilary Clinton's &quot;it-takes-a-village to raise a child&quot; speech, Warren tries to sell the idea that only in full participation  in church programs can a Christian grow and mature.<br />I expect this book will become the manual for the professionals in the world of corporate Christianity.

Tozer is more prolific and widely-read today than when he was alive. How I wish I could sit at his elbow and ask him about today's events, the future of the church, the coming King...In some ways, he answers those questions in &quot;Keys to the Deeper Life.&quot;<br />Smith Wigglesworth once referred to the gifts of salvation, baptism of the Holy Spirit, and the deeper life as &quot;Good, better, best.&quot; I think Tozer would agree.<br />Never afraid to speak truth, the first chapter sets the tone for the enitre book: &quot;Leaning into the wind&quot;. Just like him. Eschewing the hypocritical, the false glory found in man's praise, and the shallow life, Tozer puts the trumpet to his lips to issue a clear call of the Spirit, to engage God at a deeper level. He urges believers to &quot;1.)surrender, 2.)ask, 3.) obey, and 4.)believe in order to recieve the fullness of God, the Holy Spirit.<br />In the chapter, &quot;Touching Heaven in Prayer&quot;, Tozer writes:<br />  &quot;What then shall we do?<br />  We must deny self, take up the cross and count ourselves expendable.<br />  We must cease to exercise the world's judgements and try to think God's thoughts after Him.<br />  We must rekon ourselves dead to gain and glory and allow ourselves to become inextricably invloved with the cross of Christ and the high honor of God.&quot;<br />Putting God first and ourselves dead last.<br />What a concept.<br />Sounds like Christ.	2003-01-25

With sharp reasoning, infallible logic, and quick wit, Ray Comfort slices up the thin veil of atheistic \\"reasoning\\". No more excuses for those who would deny the existence of God. And nowhere to run. But to the cross.<br />Using object lessons drawn from common human experience, Comfort destroys the deceit of the enemy. The wonders of the human eye, the beauty of an organized universe displaying the glory of God, the intricacies of nature, all point to the Creator.<br />Neither the human mind, mathematical formulae, nor the scientific method can adequately apprehend all of God, it is true. But neither can they disprove Him, quite the opposite. The closer scientists get to understanding, the nearer they get to God.<br />This book is an easy read from a man whose heart beats to tell the story of Christ and for the lost. You will come away with a fire in your heart, clearer understanding in your mind, and a smile on your lips.	2003-01-25

Tozer tells the truth boldly, plainly, and unerringly on target. This little book is a treasury of spiritual insights like:<br />&quot;Faith never goes contrary to reason; faith simply ignores reason and rises above it.&quot;<br />  or<br />&quot;I have been memorizing the Scriptures ever since I was converted, but my faith does not rest on God's promises. My faith rests upon God's character.&quot;<br /><br />  or, talking about the importance of emptying oneself:<br />&quot;The less there is in the kettle, the quicker it begins to boil.&quot;<br />I love Tozer's straight-forwardness and his plain talk about complex matters. He takes the abstract and makes it concrete.<br />Tozer writes, &quot;It is not enough that I hold an inspired book in my hands. I must have an inspired heart.&quot;<br />Thanks, Lord, for sending Tozer to us and for giving him such an inspired heart.	2002-11-17

John Eldredge delivers his analysis in a fresh, stirring, and robust fashion. This book is not for the faint of heart. If you are content on your couch, remote control, and your life is just swell, don't read this book.<br /><br />But if you're like many men feeling a little lost, uncertain about the future and intuitively knowing that you're not the man God called you to be, sit down, put on a fire, and read on...<br /><br />Men, he asserts, inherently and instinctively, desire three things: adventure, battle, and to win a beauty. Instead of equipping boys and men for these virtuous tasks, society strips them of their dreams, their virile self-identity, and ultimately their soul.<br /><br />Instead of bold men of courage and strength, our culture grows weenies. Wimps. Passive, placid males who know not who they are, where they're going, or why they're here. Then in disgust, having already neutered them, society discards them as weak and irrelevent geldings, unfit for the ranch.<br /><br />If your father was aloof, removed, or never satisfied, this book may open your eyes as well as a wound or two about your relationship with him.<br /><br />There is good news - there is a heavenly father who is the ultimate father - and He is prepared to take you fishing, climbing mountains, and slaying dragons! The God of the Universe just might be waiting for you to crawl in His lap and sit still while He tells you He loves you.<br /><br />The book is stirring. Chords will strike deep in your heart.<br /><br /> If you are a woman, you may see, for the first time, inside your man in a very private and powerful way.	2002-10-25

Interspersed are personal stories and testimonies which are, in Cho's unique style, disarming, humbling, and heart-warming.<br />More than anything, Cho's heart for God and love for people raditates through the book.<br />The mature believer and the Cho student may want to skip this book and buy \\"Apocalyptic Prohecy\\", \\"Prayer the Brings Revival\\", or \\"The Fourth Dimension\\" for meatier study.

He does so here.<br />Wilkerson says, \\"Drinking is not the sin. The decision to drink is the sin.\\" Not splitting hairs, he argues that there is no scriptural, loving, caring, or Christ-like reason to drink alcohol. None. At the end of the road of drinking lies destruction and death. There is nothing of God on that road.<br />While avoiding condemning Christians who beleive otherwise, Wilkerson builds a powerful case that Jesus would never encourage drinking alcoholic beverages, even wine. While the Hebrew text does not distinguish between alcoholic and non-alcoholic wine, he maintains that the miracle of Cana was surely of the non-alcoholic variety. That Jesus would never have given people he loved a drink that made them stupid, provocative, and lustful.<br />When I started the book, I was willing to believe that, taken in moderation, a little wine was alright for the believer to enjoy. After all, \\"it makes the heart merry\\", \\"is good for the stomach\\", \\"was better than the first wine\\", etc.<br />I am now persuaded otherwise. I believe that Wilkerson has it right. That God would have us enjoy the drink made from the boiled grape, a must, mixed with water and not partake of the \\"spirits\\" of alcohol.<br />David Wilkerson, founder of Tenn Challenge with more than 200 drug and alcohol treatment centers around the world, has seen the devastation of alcohol face-to-face. I believe I yield to the prompting of the Holy Spirit when I say, leave alcohol alone, flee from it. There is nothing of God in it for us.	2002-10-21

The Bible doesn't tell us a lot about heaven. We glimpse the promise somewhere between the Eden of Genesis and New Jerusalem of Revelation.<br />Then comes Jesse with a first-hand account of heaven! The glory of God lighting up the whole place, Jesus and the prophets minstering to the saints, Paul and the Apostles teaching and talking with the citizens of heaven, eating fruit from heavenly gardens. It's all beyond credibility somehow.<br />I wondered if Jesse was pulling our leg. Selling his story for the money. Trying to make a name for himself on the speaking tour. My modern day skeptism and sense of smell for charlatans leapt within me.<br />However, reading his accounts, his commentary, and his testimony persuaded me that he is faithfully reporting what he saw, felt, and understood. I believe this is a true account of a heavenly adventure by a fellow Christian journeyman.<br />If you accept that too, you will be challenged with a burden for the lost, an urgent sense of Christ's impending return, and a deeper love for God.<br />The story is told in a simple, straightforward, and humble fashion. My wife and daughter finished it in one reading. This book is a sweet testimony to the love, patience, mercy, grace and glory of the living God of heaven and earth.	2002-08-17

I'm glad that Tozer isn't around for these darker days but speaks to us across the chasm of time to shout aloud to our generation. Perhaps he would exhort us, &quot;God is faithful and good. Trust in Him, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit to bring you home.&quot;<br />Despite his gritty teachings about daily Chirsitan living, the firm foundation of his incisive intelligence is grace.

Seven people were raised from the dead, including Polly, Smith's wife.<br />What is most touching though, is to see his humility, his passion to glorify God, and his earnest desire to be closer and closer to Christ. He was an empty vessel, desiring to be more and more filled with the Holy Spirit. God used him in mightier ways than any other twentieth century evangelist.

Instead, I found merely a collection of vignettes and quotes from historical and business leaders; short passages and quotes from busy executives. I had to choke a little before I ignored the passage from Jack Welch on personal integrity.<br />I hope Maxwell has not abandoned his Christ-centered, character building, convicting, challenging message in favor of merely selling &quot;business books&quot; and pandering to the public.<br />&quot;The Right to Lead&quot; is a disappointment in every respect. I won't put it on the same shelf as his other excellent works.	2002-06-18

Tozer speaks the truth in a straight-up, no-nonsense, hearty way.<br />\\"To become a stronger Christian take these 5 steps\\", he says:<br />  1. Don't trifle with sin<br />  2. Don't steal God's glory<br />  3. Don't own anything (actually don't let things own you)<br />  4. Don't gossip<br />  5. Don't defend yourself!<br />Beside this list of \\"Don'ts\\" stands a man who is honest, thoughtful, modest, and speaks with power and conviction. It is very much like the Lord speaking to me. Tozer reveals himself as a preacher and man, head over heals in love with Jesus. He shows a tenderness at odds with his strict, stern veneer.<br />I had a lump in my throat when he described \\"three wounds from God\\". More than once, I was pierced with conviction.<br />As a spirit-filled Christian, I will treasure this little jewel of Tozer's.	2002-06-13

Of the \\"Left Behind\\" series, this is one of the best, so far.<br />Increasingly, the supernatural nature of this conflict is being revealed. The power of God, in the face of the evil fury of the Anti-Christ, stirs the imagination of the believer.<br />Most of the action occurs in the Middle East, God's timepiece for the last days. The story is action-packed and fast-moving. Though the story line is well-known to most believers, the authors keep you on the edge of your seat through unexpected twists and turns. Just when there appears to be no way out of trouble for the children of Israel, Michael the archangel to the rescue! The bowl judgements really had me cheering for the good guys!<br />More and more, this ultimate drama between good and evil is shifting toward the heavenly realms where the true conflict will be resolved.<br />Gotta love this one...	2002-06-09

Caiaphas sees resurrected Jesus!	These ancient documents, preserved for hundreds of years in their original language deep within the Vatican, corroborate the Biblical accounts of Jesus' trial, crucifiction, and resurrection.<br />Some of the writings are straightforward reports of the period, like Josephus' writings. The author takes enormoous pains to establish their authenticity in traceable steps as well as his credentials for finding and publishing these documents.<br />Some of the accounts are truly astonishing. Pilate wrote a full description of the &quot;Jesus issue&quot; to Ceaser. He describes how he wept at the sight of bent and broken Joseph of Arimethia ascending Pilate's steps, stained with the blood of Jesus, asking for the dead body of his friend and Lord.<br />Caiaphas gives two accounts of his actions to the Sanhedrin. In the latter, he describes himself locked in his bedroom, studying the scriptures for prophecies concerning the Messiah. Suddenly, the resurrected Jesus appears before him and offers him salvation if he would but believe in the risen son of God. Caiaphas is convicted and forlorn. He resigns his position as high priest, unable to perform its functions with honor and integrity. Was he saved at the last?<br />Pilate writes to Ceaser that he had dispatched 100 Roman soldiers to stand guard over Jesus' tomb. &quot;The very event they were supposed to prevent,&quot; he said, &quot;they became witnesses to.&quot; What a profound illustration!<br />These accounts are compelling, believable,and illuminating of the Biblical accounts. The book is fun and edifying to read.	2002-05-31

Imagine if revival came to America like it did in 1857-58...<br />America had a population of 30 million people and was steamrolling its way through the industrial revolution. Life was good, if hectic and a little crazy. Churches were everywhere but there were fortunes to be made and a new continent to explore...<br />Then, in a non-descript church on the corner of Williams and Fulton Street in the financial district of New York City a man was called to pray. Jeremiah Lanphier began urging other New York City businessmen to pray. First a handful, then a dozen, then a hundred. Soon the Spirit of God swept across the city, the state, and the whole country in revival!<br />The prayer meetings were vivid with testimonies, requests for souls were sent to lay leaders who ran the one-hour meetings briskly but respectfully. There was an air of sobriety, of worship, of awe. God was pouring out from heaven. He was answering prayer.<br />Two million souls were saved in two years. All denominations. Urban and rural. North and south. Then the civil war began.<br />This was the 4th Great Revival and the last one in America. What will God do next?	2002-05-30

Books	5	19	25	N	Y	God's Grace meets New York City	David Wilkerson listened to the voice of God and obeyed. When he did, the Lord grew a holy unction into an international ministry which has now touched millions of lives around the world. From Teen Challenge Centers around the world to Times Square Church, now representing a congregation from 135 countries, to European Crusdaes and worldwide missions, this ministry is centered on Jesus Christ.<br />It is the unique focus on the personality and power of the Holy Spirit which separates this work from so many others.<br />The call to action was spoken into his life, and into the lives of a New York City street gang, headed by Nicky Cruz, in the late sixties. The Cross and the Switchblade is a modern day classic of God's power and grace infusing the most dangerous and difficult layer of society; the violent gangs.<br />The message is life changing, then and now.	2002-05-29

Have you ever felt like a failure as a Christian when God disappointed you? When God let you down?<br />What do you do when God doesn't live up to your expectations?<br />John the Baptist knew who Jesus was. They were cousins, acquainted with each other, maybe friends. Certainly God revealed Jesus in His glory when John baptised Him! Father, Son and Holy Spirit converge in a moment of spiritual manifestation.<br />But sitting in the third cell of Herod's damp, dark prison, day after day certainly didn't feel like deliverance. Where was this king? The powerful one? Where was the fire? Where was this Jesus?<br />If the &quot;greatest [man] born of woman&quot; had his questions, disappointments, frustrations, how much more might we have the same today? He knew Jesus face to face, as a man knows a friend.<br />Yet, his understanding was rocked by the God who answers many questions but rarely answers &quot;Why?&quot;.<br />Edwards answers these issues, sort of, in an insightful, profound way. The book will lead you back to where you began but with a deeper faith and clearer insight toward this powerful, invisible God who will do what He will do.<br /> &quot;His ways are not our ways and His thoughts are not our thoughts.&quot; Thank you, Lord.	2002-05-27

Personal evangelism will never be the same.<br />&quot;Contagious&quot; sets a new standard for excellence in relational evangelism. Whether you teach this course in your church or read it for yourself, you will find it quickening, refreshing and powerful.<br />The video, participant guide, leader's guide and related readings combine to provide a power-packed 8 session (or less) series which is as easy to teach as it is effective.<br />We are all called to share our faith. &quot;Contagious&quot; makes doing so more natural and compelling. As we near the end of days, this teaching becomes more urgent and more relevant. Three cheers to Hybels, Mittenburg, and Strobel for an important addition to Christian evangelism.	2002-05-27

Got a spoiled brat in your life? David did. Had both. He served a crazy king who tried to kill him and had a vain, self-absorbed son who tried to usurp him. Both nearly succeeded.<br />How David coped with these insane situations with God's love, grace, and wisdom have changed my life. The patience, respect for God, surrender, and trust in the Lord spoke powerfully to me through the years of history between us. David's unique reactions revealed Jesus Christ to me in a new way.<br />David's struggles dwarfed mine but the lessons of his life challenged me to become a better Christian - a man of honor - a man of God.<br />Gene Edwards has a gift for cutting through difficult topics on a unique slant. He brings a new level of understanding to old problems, stories, and issues. There were times when reading this book that I had to stop, lay it down, and catch my breath as new revelation washed over me.<br />A strong recommendation for the thoughtful believer who is willing to go to the next level of faith.	2002-05-25

I was prepared not to like him much. After reading of his heart for the lost, his love for Christ, his unabashed humility, his humor, I could see he was very unlike me...in all the ways that matter most to God. Cho is a man of prayer and devotion to the Lord. His life of sacrifice, obedience, and trust in the Lord reveal the secret to his success: Jesus Christ.<br />I am grateful for both the minister and his message... This is a book that will draw you closer to the heavenly realm.	2002-05-23

Have you ever wanted to be able to see inside someone; to understand why they do the things they do (or maybe yourself?)?? Finally, a book free of jargon and psycho-lingo allows you to understand the four basic personality types and their combinations. The basis of the four types comes from Greek philsophy but their &quot;working-out&quot; and reasons for behavior are  Christian-based. This book has given me &quot;Oh Wow!&quot; moments as I considered myself, my wife, children and co-workers. I am giving copies this year to loved ones and people I work with! This book is a blessing; mostly enjoyed, I would think, by believers in God.	2001-11-25
