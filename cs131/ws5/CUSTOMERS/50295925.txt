Scratching my head in wonderment caused me to buy this book (as a paperback) and it's been a wonderful helpmate. It has a great index for reference and the accompaning CD-Rom in the back of the book guided me through tutorial exercises which made understanding the possibilities of QuarkXpress easier.    I certainly didn't see the necessity of buying a whole library to explain one software program but I'm glad I chose this book. It's laid out well, simple to follow, has sufficient explanations of procedures and is written in everyday language.    Two thumbs up.

Full of Information	My daughter gave me this book as my first 'publishing' book to give me inside information to the publishing world. I took it to bed every night for months and absorbed much valuable insight into what I needed to do to get my book into the public's hands.    This \\"Idiot's\\" book is packed full of little tidbits that are easy to see in blocked sections. It helped eliminate some mistakes I would have made in my ignorance. The authors are somewhat comical in their delivery of advice.    The book is laid out very well, easy to read and understand, and I would recommend it to any aspiring author. It includes sample contracts and legal agreements that are most helpful. It describes what goes on behind the scenes of a publishing house, how to work with an editor, and finally, the ins and outs of marketing through publicity, especially media of tv and radio, and the workings of retail booksellers (I had my eyes opened!). I learned a lot through its pages and I thank my daughter for the gift.    Gail Gupton, Author: The 31-Day Diet of Spiritual Enlightenment and Seekers of Truth	2005-04-08

She wrote two short paragraphs in the Foreword, but didn't write the book. That said, however, as any book by Joel S Goldsmith is a 5-star lesson, this book is no exception.     What are 'Metaphysical Notes?', I wondered.     In this book, we are guided, gradually, into the realization of where we've been, and where we're going in our journey of Oneness with God. The publisher has done an excellent job in compilation of Joels' notes that will be a blessing to all who read the book. Of particular interest is the Question and Answer section.    I have so many of Goldsmith's books I could open a Goldsmith store. He was a mentor to me after discovering 'The Art of Spiritual Healing' in 1982.

If you like browsing through excellent photos of vintage jewelry and seeing a sampling of old jewelry ads, this book is for you. I find the quality is first class for paper, photography and binding. This would make a good 'coffee table' book.    Although containing no index for its 205 pages, the book does have a table of contents and is broken down in sections by designer. So, if you have an interest in fashion jewelry, but not a particular design or substance, you can easily read the names and histories of those who brought costume jewelry to its glamourous height, along with viewing the pictures of jewelry by that particular designer in their own appropriate chapter.    I like looking through the pages on a lonely winter night.    Gail Gupton, Author: The 31-Day Diet of Spiritual Enlightenment and Seekers of Truth	2005-03-05

This is a small book, packed tight with mind-boggling TRUTH. It will open your eyes if you're receptive. It will change your life if you let it. It will answer some of the most deepening questions of your soul. It will leave you with new peace. It will set you on a beautiful, fulfilling road you never knew existed.    Living the infinite way means seeing everything with new eyes; with spiritual perception. It means giving up past indoctrinations and false teachings of God and man perpetuated through time.    My book is hardback, purchased over 20 years ago. It got me started on my own journey, which has been a reward I'll never give up. We can all live the Infinite way when we realize who and what God is. I recommend this book and all Goldsmith writings.

This book was recommended by another author getting ready to put his book together. As having been a self-published author, plus having a book currently in publication with a mainline publisher, I read with interest the steps Tom & Marilyn Ross suggest. One can never have too many reference books!    Although they mention to read the whole book through and then go back and pick out the sections that pertain to the reader, I found highlighting sentences or paragraphs as I go along works for me, then putting a sticker 'marker' on the page to take me back to it. The only problem is I end up with too many 'tabs' because this book is chock full of pertinent information.    If I had had this book last year at this time, I would have changed some ways I did my organization. Not only do the authors tell you 'what' to do they also mention 'what not' to do - very helpful, indeed.    This book covers every aspect of writing, publishing, and marketing one's book. It starts with the conceptive idea and takes you through each stage of progress. It covers the business aspect and all the 'hats' one needs to wear when doing it 'all yourself'!    It talks of pro's and con's, covers word substitution, working capital . . . you name it, and they tell it. The Ross's give you ideas you may not have thought of before.     This, of course, is only one book on the market dealing with this subject, but I found it to be a volume-packed addition to my book shelf! If you're a would-be self-publishing author, you need this book, too.    Gail Gupton, Author: The 31-Day Diet of Spiritual Enlightenment and Seekers of Truth.	2005-03-05

In this book, Joel Goldsmith gives us the principle of TRUE healing, whether it be physical, financial, emotional, or any number of other things from which the world continues to suffer.    Spiritual healing, today, can be likened to crystals, candles, aromatherapy, psychological mumbo-jumbo, etc. Joel Goldsmith, through his personal dedicated journey, goes to the ROOT of the problem and one which individuals very likely have no cognizance of, unless, of course, they've already read other of Joel's works and have discovered the secret.    This is one of the first books I ever read by Goldsmith and I started in the early 1980s. I bought it mainly for curiosity but it soon appeared on my 'Best of the Best' book list and continues to be so.

If you're on, or contemplating being on, a spiritual journey to find God and Truth, you'll undoubtedly read books by Joel S Goldsmith, who started his own journey in the early 1900s.    This book is one I've kept in my bedside night stand to review in the quiet of the darkness outside. It always leaves me with some food for thought before I turn out the lamp for the night. Spiritual Truth is the ONLY power and when one realizes it, there is nothing else.    Gail Gupton, Author: The 31-Day Diet of Spiritual Enlightenment and Seekers of Truth	2005-03-05

Years ago I was told I should have in my audio library the series of talks given by Joel Goldsmith in Hawaii in the 1950's. But I already had a number of his tapes, so I put off buying more.    Then this book was introduced which consists of later classes in Hawaii. What a treat to read the difference in how Joel's consciousness had been transformed from books of earlier times! The words somehow, at least to me, became deeper, more profound.    This book is volume packed and flows as though you are right there with him, hearing him, seeing him, feeling the presence of God within him when he goes into meditation with his students. Example: Page 211, \\"Close your eyes, and very gently inside of yourself say: 'I. That is all. I is within you, so learn to trust it, but not as a power over anything. Just trust 'I am with you' and rest, relax.\\"    As always, Joel's delivery is not trite or superficial or pompous. Down to earth, friendly, and spoken in language every one can understand.    Joel S Goldsmith was a mystic teacher whose writings I devoured for many years. This 600+ page hardback is no exception.

It has been so well read and used that the binding has come unglued and the white lettering on the black spine is wearing away. What more can I say?    My book is marked up with highlighting which I would apply whenever I'd read something that caused the 'light' to come on. The book is full of Joel's meditations in Italics which, when contemplated on, will guide you into all Truth.    When my elderly dad was laying in a hospital one time (not an Infinite Way student), I took this book and read the meditations to him out loud by his bedside. He told me it gave him such a sense of peace. Is it no wonder? God IS peace and was right there with us, AS us.    I've also been told that Practicing The Presence, by Joel Goldsmith, is required reading for a number of 'metaphysical' courses in the United States and abroad.    If you're thinking of which book to start with, this will be a great beginning!    Gail Gupton, Author: The 31-Day Diet of Spiritual Enlightenment and Seekers of Truth	2005-03-05

I first picked up this book over 20 years ago, at an Infinite Way study center. The title caught my eye as being something I needed at the time, as my husband and I were going through some financial struggles. I knew God was the source, but how could I connect to my 'spiritual resources'?     My copy got all marked up with highlighted sentences, turned down corners and paper clips for markers. That should tell you something of the valuable contents. I used to read it at a laundromat while our clothes were being washed and dried.    My husband and I were trying to get a business started and this little book had many diamonds in it that reflected back in my thought at the time. On page 154, a section starts, 'Begin To Pour'. And, so we did.    Although it took years of practice, the principle paid off with abundance. I highly recommend this book to anyone who may be stuck on the answer to 'supply'.

I've been around people who continue through adulthood to strive for their elderly parents' approval only because their 'well' was not sufficiently filled as a child. Sad, but true.     Author, Mark Leonard, gives the reader almost step-by-step instruction on how to fill not only one's self with positive affirmation, but gets the reader to identify how our self image is expressed in our day-to-day activities often by the way we treat our own offspring, those we care about, or should care about the most. One often perpetuates to the next generation the negative attributes picked up from our own childhood. Positive begets positive. Negative begets negative.     The unconscious human mind has a way of retaining what it believes to be the 'right' way (programmed behavior) and sometimes it takes a book like this to remind us of what others see that we fail to see when we look in the mirror.     I was impressed with 'Empty Well, Thirsty Heart' in the very first chapter when I read \\"God is love and it is the nature of God to express itself.\\" I couldn't agree more. One can never change the world, or the next generation until they first love God enough to let God's love express itself through them.

Although the text is written in Italian, this Brunialti book is worthy of the purchase price if only for the abundance of quality photographs of vintage jewelry. It's a huge 299-page book with some solid substance. It would make a great coffee-table book, in itself.

From the other reviews I had read, I was excited about seeing all the mouth-watering recipes. After all, one needs to have some incentive to eat raw food over and over again. And, I wasn't disappointed.    The first recipe I concocted was on page 186 'Orange-Date Dessert Bars'. YUMMY. Fun to fix and delicious to eat. As a matter of fact, the taste was very similar to some health-food bars for which I pay $2.85 EACH. So, right away I probably made up for the cost of the book. (Not including ingredients)    Anyway, the photos are, indeed, incredible and will easily help you decide which recipes to try first. There's such an assortment of salads, soups, and drinks that anyone can find something they like.    I don't have an expensive professional juicer. I use a Juiceman Jr. and I have a Cuisinart Blender/Processor Combo, which I found sufficient for use with the recipes found here. After using the blender, I poured the puree into a sieve and mashed it down with a wooden spoon to release as much juice at possible.

I will have to say, however, that I was craving food, but knowing that the Master Cleanser was working and doing its job, I hung in there for the final result.     I lost 10 pounds and all my friends said I looked great. After the cleanse, I started thinking more about eating healthier food. This book can change your life.     I know, I know, you may be thinking it's an old-fashioned 'method' and why not just take a laxative every day and cover your ailments with a pill. The fact that we treat our own body with substandard remedies only alerts one to the fact we have problems to start with.    I found The Master Cleanser book informative and helpful. I'm glad I bought it, I'm glad I followed the directions, and I'll do it again.

As a vintage jewelry dealer at Atlanta Vintage Jewelry dot com, I needed information about the marks of silver jewelry that came from Mexico. Other vintage costume jewelry collecting books that I owned didn't often refer to Mexican silver other than the highly collectible ones such as Taxco and Spratling.    I didn't necessarily care about the history of a person or about the area of Mexico a piece of silver came from. What I wanted, and got with the purchase of this book, is the initials and numbers used in the hundreds of examples that are found in silver jewelry. These explanations can then become knowledge for use when I do find a piece that bears a certain mark.

I bought this book almost 25 years ago, as a hardback, from an Infinite Way Study Center. It became one of my favorite books and I have given copies of it to others who had an interest in learning more of the Truth as taught by Joel Goldsmith.     Yes, the thunder of God's presence reverberates after the still small voice heard in the silence of the cavern of one's being. And, when you finally have that spiritual realization and hear God's still small voice, it will come through roaring, as though thundering in your soul and you'll never forget it.    I've read this book over and over again. I even read it onto cassette tapes so I could listen to it in bed, with the lights out. An excellent, excellent source of spiritual growth.     Buy it.

He liked it, as he was always open and receptive to anything that talked of Truth. I was disappointed in it. Although I can certainly relate to the 'Now' as being the only power, because God is the only 'Power' and God is certainly in the 'Now', I found it somewhat repetitive. Once I grasped what he was saying, the rest became boring as I realized I already knew what he was talking about so why go further?    I did not find it 'spiritual' but rather psychological in its deliverance of, what seemed to me, overcoming one power with another. Also, Tolle writes a lot about pain, which seems like the mind wants to stay on that word and have it etched rather than on the opposite one of 'health' or 'well-being' or God. Now I know a lot of people have pain in their lives and this is a very real word to eliminate or 'overcome' with the power of 'now', but I think he emphasized the word 'pain' too much. For those who use affirmations as a way of overcoming negatives, this book would not have done it for me, and it may not for you either. I really don't know how the book got to be so popular. Tolle must have had a good advertising campaign to get it off the ground and into people's homes through promotion.    It may be a good book for those starting on a spiritual journey or for those who are not quite there yet, or as a complement to other spiritual books in one's library, but it didn't appeal to me as a book worthy of holding on to.

Tolle's descriptions of the mind and of meditation may be great for others who are just starting out on a personal journey of finding Truth.

Not only was I attracted to this book because I grew up in the 60's, but because I also sell vintage costume jewelry on my web site, Atlanta Vintage Jewelry.     Roseann Ettinger's book contains a lot of pictures that were nostalgic to me. It features deco jewelry, punk, novelty and bi-centennial pieces, plus mod and Avon jewelry popular when I was in school, and a whole lot more, including themes like 'Back to Nature'.     This book is not only great for vintage jewelry collectors or people who deal in jewelry, like myself, but also as a great reminder of when we were teens. I love it.

It's chock full of excellent pictures and information for the vintage jewelry collector, whether a novice or one of long-standing. The book is well organized in its layout. I've discovered it's a 'collectible' book in its own right. Author, Marcia Sparkles Brown, has a video, which I also own and recommend.    Although not a whole lot on each designer, some mention is better than none. To find references to Judy Lee, BSK, LaRoco, Park Lane, Avon, Capri, Art, JJ, Les Bernard, Capri, etc. was of interest to me when I first started collecting jewelry because of the scarcity of volumes on these names. Other designers, such as Lisner, Coventry, Napier, Monet, etc., also included in this book, were more easily found when doing searches for designers.    The book has no index, so this may be a concern to others. But the designer names are presented in alphabetical order.

Marcia Brown continues to put sparkle into her books. Each one is a wonderful reference guide. As a novice vintage jewelry collector and dealer, I often take her books to bed with me and study all the great pictures. If you like vintage jewelry, you will love looking through her books!

It contains a lot of great ideas I would never have thought of. The only disadvantage is that it was written before 9/11 and some of the information was immediately obsolete. For instance, I was going to send a package for reviewers containing items related to my book (great marketing idea), but people now do not accept unsolicated boxes for security purposes. So, this information had to be scrapped. The book is well worth the money even if you just get one good workable idea. But, I got a whole lot more than that and you will, too!

I learn as I go and every book I buy has some tidbit of excellent information. My feeling is that one can never have too many books as they become our reference guides. Jeanenne Bell did an excellent job and I refer to this book regularly. I'm glad I bought it.    Gail Gupton, Author: The 31-Day Diet of Spiritual Enlightenment and Seekers of Truth.	2004-11-17

But the book is much more than a story because it has a message in it.     If read by troubled youth, it could very well give them insight to where they're headed and how to avoid disasterous results of drugs and alcohol. Everyone has a purpose in life and this book shows the reader that we're led to do what we're supposed to do, even in the face of seeming obstacles.     There are persons who seem to be 'guardian angels' but whom we would never meet if we didn't take the road less traveled. I rate this book \\"Excellent\\" with a great ending.

This book was my introduction to The Infinite Way.  Having been reared in Christian Science, I found the book fascinating from the standpoint of transition, being that Joel had also been a Christian Scientist. It gives a perception of the person we know as 'Joel' and provides an understanding of relativeness.  We have all been through growing experiences, and 'A Spiritual Journey . . .' paves the way for the beginner and adds light to an otherwise mysterious past of an enlightened mystical teacher.    The book provided a very important principle to my husband and myself. We typed and framed a quote from this book that helped immensely in our business of being self-employed 'together'. It's found on page 163 which states, \\"two individuals, each recognizing his God-given individual capacity . . . . \\" and I'll let you discover the rest of the sentence. After 22 years, it's still hanging on a wall of my home.    If one is a follower of the works of Joel Goldsmith, this book, I believe, is the only one out there that gives insight to the man during his formative years. A blessing to me, and I think it will be to you also. Lorraine Sinkler did the world a favor when she wrote this one, regardless of whether or not Joel wanted a biography. We're all making a transition and to know that someone 'just like us' has already paved the way, and how, is of immeasurable value.
