(i loved the way guy gave props to the black troops who fought in world war 1. there were many black troops who paid the cost that will never be recognized.) if you are &quot;politically correct,&quot; you may be outraged by  the hatred whites express toward blacks and vice versa.<br />spike lee once said &quot;blacks were incapable of being racist, they could only be prejudiced.&quot; i disagree. some blacks are extremely racist, but their hatred of whites can be justified, because of the hate and injustice they have suffered at the hands of whites. if the situation was reversed and if whites had to live like blacks, they would kill themselves in a week. it's too bad more books like standing at the scratch line don't come down the pike, because they would go a long way in getting blacks and whites to finally deal with the race problem. every character is dickensian: they play a purpose,and aren't merely &quot;bit players.&quot; besides, king, serena, impressed me most of all, because she didn't come off as just another &quot; wifey &quot; character; she was a warrior who did more than just stood beside king, she helped him fight his battles( screw xena !) and even sacrificed herself for him<br />i'm not going to go into too much detail about the book, i don't want to give away the plot, but i will say this, guy's writing talent definately has maya's dna all over it, and that is a good thing! this is an epic that will be welcomed into the black literary canon along with native son and the invisble man. in an age which some black kids could recite tupac's lyrics before they name could name 10 countries in africa,it is refreshing to discover a book that not only educates, but also entertains as well as force you to look at race beyond the &quot;us versus them&quot; paradigm. i'm going to give copies of this book to my closest black friend and my closest friend. black and white people need to read this.	2000-11-29

I'm not trying to be a moralist, but a man helps make a child too. shelby  thinks all men are dogs and yet she dates richard, because he's successful,  but she doesnt care about him, leading him on. there's more but i wont give  it away. read the book.           i didnt like the plot twist regarding  leonard; he was the most likable character in the book. debra is a  &quot;good christian woman&quot; and yet, she's a racist. though when you  discover why, you feel her pain. Eric Jerome Dickey will probably never be  compared to Richard Wright or James Baldwin( he's not literary or  high-minded enough);he probably doesn't care with all the loot he makes  from his books.but that's okay, his style is fine and it suits the masses.  overall, its a better than average beach book.	2000-06-21

Bowman does a very good job at keeping the reader interested  in her characters and triumphs at making us care for them...taylor came off  as being too wholesome, which is a laugh, when you consider that she was  considering marrying philip just to advance her career...actually the big  surprise in this book was how well the supporting characters came  off..Shari is delightful as taylor's  bitchy boss whom in the end, only  thinks of her own needs...carla of course is the goody two shoes...oh well,  everyone cant be &quot;skanless&quot;....Julian seems like the type of  brotha who would better off neutered, but, he's human, so don't hate him  too much...a collection of epidoses of the tragic mullato and the world  they live in....this book smacks of a made for tv movie...jennifer beals  (the flashdance girl) or even halle berry would be perfect as taylor...an  okay book, but only as escapist reeding...a marginal 3 star review	2000-05-10

Milk In My Coffee is the latest novel to encounter this subject, and pretty much  scores a home run. Dickey is excellent at using pop culture references to  describe the world that Kimberly and Jordan live in...Other writers would  have used them to the point of overkill, but Eric utilizes them with fresh  twists... Jordan's feelings for Kimberly, and his internal conflict over  being involved with a white woman are honest and at the same time,we smile  as the love between the two blossom. i have dated outside my race  constanly, as a black male, so i could easily relate to  Jordan. I loved  the character, Kimberly, though my only complaint with Eric about her, was  that, i thought he was a bit deceptive in portraying her as a &quot;white  woman&quot;, when she was really &quot;biracial.&quot; But then again,  there is no such thing as &quot;pure&quot; white or &quot;pure&quot; black  races, so i forgive Eric for that &quot;slight of hand.&quot; After all,  for many decades, if a person had one drop of black blood in them, they  were considered BLACK! Eric also makes great use of the supporting  characters in the story and of their opposition and eventual, if reluctant,  support to their relationship; i thought the feelings expressed by them  were honest also, because in real life, people may not always approve of  your choices, but they will tolerate them! As for J'nette... I thought  Dickey made her to be too bitchy;not all sistas are like that! but overall,  i commend Eric for making a bold, refreshing statement about black  male/white female couples in America, and how love can work, if two people  really want it !	2000-04-18

It was interesting to see a viewpoint on how the Post-War Germans dealt with the conflict.The central characters in the reader,Michael and Hanna were very well drawn, and though  at times it may have seen impossible to sympathize with them and their  struggles, my heart went out to them, as they struggled to deal with the  atrocities of war, and their love for each other. The prose in the book is  clean and straightfoward, and yet its power is luminous from beginning to  end. Anyone who is curious about the holocaust, or simply about how the  power of love can affect two people should definately read this book.	2000-03-15
