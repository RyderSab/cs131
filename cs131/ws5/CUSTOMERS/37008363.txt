It is a dirty, dirty book, with pictures the same. It goes no place, run on sentences; fragmented senences. Talked about his fight with the FCC and people who don't like his dirty talk.

And just run on sentences going nowhere.  He must sell them to his followers, becasue there is nothing of interest in it just talking and talking and talking of the FCC, and how he did this and that, where ever he ends up, he does.

I see he gave no name, so I'm pretty sure it was a rival of the writer.  I didn't realize it was a vanity book, but then so did Faulkner, Twain and a few others resort to that.  For myself, I'm a recovering person, and if there were some mistakes in the book, I guess I didn't notice, nor care, it got the point across, and gave me what I needed, which was not Shakespear, or a professor in English. I suggest he read Edgar Rice Burroghs, or James Joyce's first editions, it took the editors 20-years to get all the erros out of their books; this is a self-help book not a grammar course.	2004-02-23

But to insult all the reviews is a bit rude.  Second, I read the book, I admit I have read better written books, but I doubt I would find a more down to earth book, and to the point, written book, that is, than this one. And it might be fare to say, this of course is not a novel, and cannot be written like one, in a like manner,I doubt you will get what you want out of this book if you are not interested in the subject, that being: either the person recovering, trying to recover or wanting to know about the recovering process.  I am the last of the three, wanting to know about it, and to be honest, I think I would have gotten more out of it if I was the recovering person, or a co-dependent; but I can see as in many books I read, and I do read a lot, if you are looking for something to smash you'll find it.  I doubt as one person had said, a rival is looking this book to smash, I think possible a less inclined person would do it.But I don't want to take away from that reviewers perspective either, for he or she may be right, again, I'm not in the book business, or recovery, just trying to gain knowledge.	2004-02-23

And even a little chamber music from the style of  James Joyce. Some structured poetry, some free verse.   He is wild, wild, tame and calm, Godly and devilish.

Very interesting if not outright magical.  Who would ever think of  looking at the Arab from vantage point of his god, and infering his god of course, or their god, the Muslims, god, is not the same one, the same god as everyone else, that is, the Jew and Christian, thus, they can do as they please he suggest, just by adding or modifying whatever they want changed to justify their next move;  since they  are helping God out in his quest to stomp out resistence to Islam, anything goes; and in the process, possible bring everybody to Islam, no matter what, or how.  It would seem easier though, for god to just push a button instead of having Muslims do all the work.  Anyway, so he implies, I think so.  I got to re-read the book, I think.	2003-10-16

The Author talks about visions, and I do believe we are living in the latter days of mankind, so printed in the Bible.  And therefore, it maybe even makes a little more sense for me. It was all put into a story form.	2002-04-09

I now can understand a little better what happened with the angelic force that inhabited earth some eaons ago.  The author puts this into a story form, and real or not, it sure is convincing.  Steven King or Ann Rice should do so good to make it come alive.  The author takes you through a vortex of images and an encounter with the angelic force that ruled the world so many thousands of years ago.  It makes one wonder and think.  I think it is quite refreshing, and somewhat of a discover.	2002-02-26
