In those areas, the books excels greatly. However, it's more prominent asset is the love story between Henry and Claire. Their journey through time is a unique one, and it is filled with questions from the get-go.<br /><br />Why does Henry time-travel, and can he learn to control it?<br /><br />How does Henry's time-traveling affect Claire, his true love?<br /><br />How can a relationship so odd as theirs survive the sudden surprises?<br /><br />All are answered here, and I was happy to be along for their ride.<br /><br />If you like an honest love-story and not a Harlequin romance, then this book is for you. Throw in a little sci-fi, and you have one of the most unique stories of the past five years.	2005-08-15

I wanted a cooking tome that had three basic things: First, I wanted a book that had simple recipes for any occasion, as well as more complex recipes for those daring souls to test their culinary mettle. Second, I wanted cooking tips and advice from professionals. And finally, I wanted color photos of completed dishes as well as photos of preparation.<br />The only general cookbook that satisfied these criteria, for me, was the Betty Crocker Cookbook. I am very happy with this book, and I will be using it often.<br />Great for cooking newbies (like me,) and those who simply want tried and true recipes that have stood the test of time.	2004-01-07

If Book One was the Introduction and Book Two was the Continuation of that, Book Three is the emotional highpoint of the three.<br />\\"Prizoner of Azkaban\\" is a longer book, and justifiably so. The story takes on a scope not seen in previous books, and it delves more deeply into Harry Potter's own, sad history.<br />In the story, a well-known murderer, Sirius Black, has escaped the wizard's prison of Azkaban after he is heard muttering, \\"He is at Hogwarts.\\" Harry Potter has already dealt with exciting adventure in his first two years of school, but nothing can prepare him for what awaits in his third as the whole wizarding world rallies to try and stop Black from reaching Harry. Harry will find that some things cannot be stopped once they are set into motion, and this book does well to continually make that point.<br />More emotional and more frightening than the previous books, \\"Prizoner of Azkaban\\" is the best book of the first three. It is, once again, very well written in Rowling's mannered prose, and the characters are all tested in ways that illuminates their increased maturity. If you liked the first two books, there is literally no reason why you would not like Book Three. Rumor had it that Steven Spielberg wanted to film Book Three, as it was the story that touched him the most. Judging by the intense scenes in \\"Azkaban,\\" it's no wonder he liked that one best.<br />Do yourself a favor, and buy this book. If you haven't read Book's One and Two, read those first, but promise yourself to read Book Three. It will be worth your while.	2002-12-16

Few people remember that before this book came out, all Star Trek books were small, episodic paperbacks that you could read in an afternoon. This book was an important step in Trekdom as it is the very first Star Trek book that was written as a full-blown novel of original material.<br />Here, we are introduced to Captain Kirk, Mr. Spock, &quot;Bones&quot; McCoy, and all the other Trek favorites when they first meet each other. All is not well aboard ship, and the cameraderie we know and love from these characters is all but absent, initially. They are wary of each other, distracted by duty, obsessed with personal agendas, and so on.<br />We see the crew of the Starship Enterprise as a bunch of individuals rather than the cohesive core of the ship we know from other stories, but it is utterly fascinating to see this crew meld together in crisis, not knowing the long history they will have together.<br />Kirk is the youngest man to captain a starship in the Federation, and some of his crew are not impressed with him. Kirk's main critic is Spock, who sees the Captain as &quot;impetuous.&quot; But Kirk has more problems on his hands than a disapproving Vulcan: The ship's surgeon has yet to report to duty, the helmsman wants to be anywhere else than at the helm of the Enterprise, and Kirk soon realizes that his first mission as Captain of the Enterprise is far less the exciting mission he expected. He is ordered to transport a group of performers on a morale-boosting tour for the Federation. What no one knows is that this presumably tame mission could be their last!<br />If you thought you knew Kirk, Spock, McCoy, and the rest of the crew, you haven't read anything yet. Written by noted SF author, Vonda N. McIntyre, this is a wonderful prequel that captures the essence of why we love Star Trek in the first place.<br />If you ever wondered what it was like to see the Captain Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise on it's first mission together, look no further. You'll be happy to have been along for the ride.happy to have been along for the ride.	2002-10-21

This is the first Kay Scarpetta I have read, and I am not only not impressed, it ranks as one of the worst reads of life.<br />Ms. Cornwell has a horrid propensity for using the word \\"for\\" in a sentence instead of \\"since\\" or \\"because.\\" An example of a sentence Cornwell would write could be, \\"I wanted to go to the grocery store, FOR I needed milk for my cereal.\\" It was incredibly distracting to me because it was an amateurish attempt to pump up the prose. The best way to pump up the prose is to write a great story, not inject archaic forms of speech into the writing.<br />Another problem I had was with Dr. Kay Scarpetta. According to what I've read in this book, Dr. Scarpetta is an expert at, quite literally, EVERYTHING. Whether it's forensics, ballistics, photography, or any other subject, Scarpetta is portrayed as a woman who knows it all. Every expert she sees says things to her like, \\"Well, as you already know . . . \\" as they describe the technical details. This became irritating as I felt the author was simply bragging about her own knowledge. Also, in the rarest of rare cases when Kay Scarpetta did NOT know something, usually Lucy, Kay's all-too imperfect, but brilliant niece, knew the answer. I wanted desperately to see Kay NOT know something, or at least have a hunch that proved wrong, but Cornwell has written Scarpetta to be a nearly perfect professional. Her only flaws seem to be emotional.<br />Another irritant is Scarpetta's tendency to have to prove that she's an authority figure wherever she goes, and to whomever DARES threaten her authority. After all, how dare ANYONE usurp Scarpetta's authority. Scarpetta is one of the most irritating protagonists I've ever come across in fiction. I found her colleague, Marino, to be FAR more interesting because he was noticably flawed. I don't want to read about perfect characters, and Cornwell seems to want Scarpetta as a perfect medical examiner. That may be fun for some people, but it kills all the drama in a book for me. She is materialistic when she talks about her car as if it's a child by always referring to is as \\"My Mercedes.\\" Puh-leez! If I have to hear anything more about her damn Benz, I think I'm gonna hurl.<br />Finally, the ending was ridiculous. Without ruining it for others, I'll only say that it was about as satisfying as watching an impatient mother who ends a story to her 5 year old daughter by saying \\"everybody lives happily ever after. The end. Now go to sleep.\\"<br />This is one reader who is thoroughly unimpressed with Ms. Cornwell's Scarpetta series.for me.

In 2001, I saw most of the races, and part of the way into the season, I bought this book to use as a reference as I watched the races live on TV. I am VERY glad I did because it enhanced my viewing greatly.<br />It was nice to open the book up to the Hockenheim page, for example, to see the chicanes, the long straightaways, the S-curve  into the stadium section, etc. TV coverage might have one graphic that shows the whole circuit, but with the book beside me on the couch, I can refer to it throughout the race.<br />I like how the tracks are laid out on the pages. The tracks are colorful, they detail general speeds at various points on the track, and they feature a footnote about a famous incident or two over the years.<br />I know that there are more comprehensive books out there about the F1 circuits, but for a guy just getting into the sport, the book was PERFECT for me.	2002-01-10

The second book of the Harry Potter series, &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,&quot; has more twists and turns, is more exciting, and provides more scary imagery than the first book. There are more dangers awaiting Harry than ever before, and it provides for a reading experience that exceeds the promise of the first book exponentially.<br />In this tale, it is Year Two for Harry, and everyone who was nasty to Harry in the first book is even nastier here. The Dursleys are meaner than ever, Professor Snape oozes contempt for Harry more than last time, and Draco Malfoy, Harry's main rival at Hogwarts, is even more delightfully slimy and slippery.<br />J.K. Rowling's writing is as straight-forward and uncomplicated as the first book, and it is a wonderfully fast read. The events unfold before you at such a rapid rate that I never wanted to put the book down.<br />If you have read the first book, or seen the first movie, this book is a MUST-HAVE. How can you resist the further adventures of Harry Potter? (If you can, you are a stronger person than myself.) I prefer to be sucked into Harry's world, and I think you'd enjoy the second trip yourself.	2002-01-10

If you love auto racing, this book is a MUST HAVE! It doesn't matter what kind of racing circuit you enjoy: NASCAR, Formula One, IRL, CART, it doesn't matter. This book shows the tracks, detailed descriptions of each turn, including highlights of famous races on each course. For circuits that have changed over the years, it even shows the evolution of the changes. With stunning color photos of famous drivers, famous racing moments, and several track perspectives, and even the famous 14 mile Nurburgring circuit from days gone by. This is a book all racing fans should have sitting close by to refer to at a moment's notice.<br />NOTE: (added 5/19/02) The book only goes up to the 1999 season, so it will not reflect the changes made to Hockenheim, Germany's circuit in the 2002 season. This is a MUST HAVE book if you have an interest in remembering the older, longer Hockenheimring that is now a thing of the past.	2001-11-28

I had learned about Muggles and wizardry, but I did not read the books. They seemed like all the other children's book crazes, such as Goosebumps, The Babysitters Club, etc, that have a brilliant few years of popularity and die out from overexposure. Therefore, I didn't pay it much mind. Boy, was I an bloomin' idiot.<br />This book is a triumph. Why? It is a book that adults enjoy on the same level as the kids. This places the movie adaptation in &quot;Star Wars&quot; territory. Meaning that it's a story that transcends all age groups, races, and sexes.<br />Harry Potter is like a boy Cinderella. He has a miserable life until his Prince Charming comes, namely an eight foot, bearded giant, named Hagrid, with an invite for Harry to attend an infamous wizard's school.<br />This book is like &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; and &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; rolled up into one. It has the wonder and innocence of the former, and the magic and adventure of the latter. J.K. Rowling has herself a franchise that has more than just &quot;legs.&quot; (An entertainment industry term for &quot;sustained popularity.&quot;) It has the potential to rival some of the most popular cultural pieces of modern literature in terms of social relevance.<br />It is well written, great fun to read, and it makes you want to purchase the next book right away. Adults, buy it for your kid, and then read it yourself. It's a very entertaining book.	2001-11-24

I do not own &quot;Mein Kampf.&quot; It will probably find its way into my collection of history books eventually, but in the meantime, this book will have to suffice.<br />&quot;Hitler's Table Talk&quot; is the results of transcribed &quot;conversations&quot; Hitler had at various dinners, lunches, and other social gatherings. He talks about the war, his loves, his hatreds, and even his rationale for having a mistress. (He thought that it would have been cruel to any woman who would marry him since he was travelling constantly and would have little time for attending to a spouse.)<br />What struck me most about this book were two things: First, Hitler dwells so much on WWI that one gets the impression that it not only shaped his worldview, but he was never able to free himself completely from that war. As if WWI were a great tumor on his body that he acknowledged, yet refused to have removed. Hitler seems mired in the past during these daily discussions rather than focused on the war effort in Germany.<br />The second aspect that I found odd was Hitler's fondness for exclaiming, in very profound terms, his opinions on the most insignificant and minute topics ranging from German life (one in which he felt destined to shape,) and women in politics, (which he thoroughly detested.)<br />He was mind-mumbingly boring at times, and the only way most people could stand him is the threat of execution if any hint of disloyalty was noticed.<br />I give this book 4 stars because it is still a very important document. Here, we can learn about this Austrian madman's plans for Germany in a more conversational style than can be found in &quot;Mein Kampf.&quot; But I take away a star since Hitler is far less captivating than one would expect from a man who fought his way from beer hall riots to become the leader of Germany.<br />It is a great resource for the diehard historian, but it is not a page-turner in the least. It is exasperating, unintentionally hilarious, and infuriating all at once.all at once.	2001-11-24

As it must be with  surfers who are ever in search of the perfect wave, I am always in search of the perfect book of writing advice.<br />What I've always wanted is a book that is flexible enough to meet my own writing needs while inspiring me to &quot;push the envelope,&quot; so to speak. Some books cater to science fiction writing, while others target the would-be romance novelist. One book will tell you that writing is an art, while another will tell you that a writer who doesn't write with an audience in mind will achieve the standard definition of the &quot;starving writer.<br />As my library grew, my knowledge increased, but the desire to learn more about my craft has not been satisfied. I hope it never is.<br />The book &quot;Dare to Be a Great Writer&quot; is, in my opinion, the author's personal challenge to you, the writer, to never settle with mediocre writing. It is broken down into easily digestible segments with each topic containing clear and concise tips and advice on many different subjects.<br />&quot;Openings,&quot; &quot;Plot,&quot; &quot;Character, &quot;Forshadowing,&quot; and &quot;Genre&quot; are just some of the many topics in the book. None of these detailed segments are featured together, which I believe is the author daring you to be serious about your writing enough to absorb it all without needing to refer to it constantly. There is an index in the back, just in case you want to figure out how to solve a specific problem, but I've found that I rarely need it.<br />This book gives me many pieces of clear-cut advice and inspiration that I can safely say that this book has done more for me in honing my writing than any other single book in my writing library. I cannot say that the same will happen for you, but I think it can be an essential part of any serious writer's reference list.iter's reference list.	2001-10-17

I knocked the book down one star because it's not a comprehensive read.

This leads me to believe that the book is one man's attempt to categorize the show in a way that Groening probably would not agree. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; is, and has always been, a show that pokes fun at religion, its excesses, its contradictions, its pomposity, and its tendancy to use fear as its prime motivating factor. It is not anti-religious, but it certainly casts a critical eye where other shows would dare not express. It's interesting, though, that Mr. Pinsky seems to be ignoring the more scathing indictments of religion shown on the program. Since it does not appear to be endorsed by anyone involved with the show itself, it is about as interesting to me as one of those rushed paperback bios about pop artists like Britney Spears and N'Sync. I'd recommend sticking with the Authorized Books on &quot;The Simpsons,&quot; and leaving this one on the rack.	2001-09-20

These techniques are used to convince the listeners that a clearly defined, &quot;logical fallacy&quot; actually has a basis in fact. In that department, Mr. Limbaugh is a Master.<br />This book does a fantastic job in cutting through the foggy rhetoric of Limbaugh's monologues by tackling every errant remark with precision, wit, and wisdom. Some fans of Limbaugh's show (many of whom are featured in ALL their rage-filled glory on this very message board,) reacted to this book just like many Muslims who reacted to &quot;The Satanic Verses.&quot; While I thoroughly disagreed with the Muslim reaction to that book's release, at least they had religious beliefs behind their opposition to the book. Dittoheads, as Limbaugh's fans have often been called, do not have equal holy (or ideological) footing from which to criticize this book's careful examination of their hero's rabble-rousing rhetoric. To ignore Rush's flawed look at the world would be to dismiss the rules of logic entirely. One look at this book proves to the reader that Rush is not a &quot;truth-detector.&quot; It shows that he is just a guy with a microphone and a mouth who makes mistakes in reason every single day on his show.<br />The book does not misstate Rush's position, as some have alleged here. If he had been, that would be grounds for slander. Rush knows that he would have to face his inaccuracies in a court of law, and he's smarter than to fall for that.) Every quote is cataloged with a date and a medium where the quote was found, whether it be from Limbaugh's old TV show, his radio show, or one of his books. Anyone who wishes to check Rush's own words has the facts to do the research.<br />It would be nice if the author came out with an updated version. Yet again, Rush's influence over politics is minimal now, due in no small part to this book, so maybe this book was enough.part to this book, so maybe this book was enough.	2001-06-05

He reads Leonard's crisp dialogue with the right balance of seriousness and cutting wit. But something was still missing. Compared with other narrators, Steve's read was rather dry and straight: Kind of like your Dad reading a book to you at night. Dad never has the same kind of flourish you might expect from a professional actor, but since he's your Dad, you don't complain. With Steve Buscemi, I expected more. There's enough of the ACTOR Buscemi there to be effective, but it's not enough to be considered extraordinary.<br />Still, it is a mild complaint in the face of such great writing. Leonard writes the hard-boiled yarn better than anyone around, and this is no different. I would have preferred a more explosive ending, but it does satisfy all the requirements readers have for endings: Everything is resolved, and nothing is left dangling. Overall, it is a good story narrated by a quality actor, but I still would have preferred a little extra &quot;umph&quot; from both Leonard AND Buscemi.	2001-04-24

First of all, I can tell all of my friends that I have a dead body in my library. But aside from the obvious humor I can get from owning this book, this is a truly wonderful work of computer and photographic technology. To have a visual reference of an entire human body is not only informative and fascinating, but useful for medical students, writers, forensic specialists, or just the plain curious.<br />The book details an entire human body in a series of 1-mm thick slices from head to toe. There are three distinct views: Transverse, or a horizontal slice; Coronal, or a vertical slice from side-to-side; And Sagittal, or a vertical slice front-to-back. Each left-hand page features a close-up of a featured slice and a legend indicating where on the body the slice is located, and each right-hand page features 12 slices in smaller photos, each numbered in sequence so you can follow the path of organs and other bodily features.<br />Without this book, the only way you could find something more like a cadaver is in the local morgue. I recommend this book highly.	2001-03-05

This is not simple fiction, folks. It is a preaching tool for Christians to scare people into following them and their religion. Since talk of Hell doesn't seem to bother anyone anymore, propagandists LaHaye and Jenkins have used &quot;The Rapture&quot; as a contemporary way of scaring people into &quot;falling in line.&quot; After all, who would possibly want to be denied the lavishness of heaven by being &quot;left behind?&quot; The authors do not wish readers to think of this as mere fiction, but as a warning for a future that they are convinced is coming.<br />Make no mistake. This is not intended as simple science-fiction, or a light Sunday afternoon read. The intent is to convince you that if you do not follow the path that Christians follow, you will be &quot;Left Behind.&quot; It's arrogant, pushy, and should be seen for what it is: A blatant, recruiting tool for Christianity using fiction and fear as their main weapon.	2001-01-21

Charles Manson was said to be a fan of this book. With the &quot;free love&quot; themes and the pre-women's lib attitude found here, it's not surprising, but that should not deter you from picking up a copy of this book.<br />There are themes here that will make some people uncomfortable, but these should be read in the context of the times in which it was written.<br />It's the early Sixties. America is fascinated by beat poets, Lenny Bruce, and the ideas of feminism are only beginning to germinate in society. Using his Harshaw character, Heinlein fantasizes about a world where women are at his sexual beck-and-call, willingly, confidently, and unquestioningly. Harshaw has total independance from the outside world, and the power to protect his interests against a repressed society. Harshaw really is Heinlein's mouthpiece when he discusses religion, philosophy, and a social structure that many people in the hippie community found quite alluring at the time.<br />If this book is read in context with the times of the early Sixties, many of the themes will be entertaining, thought-provoking, and intellectually stimulating.<br />If you read this book with a contemporary frame of mind, you set yourself up to be disappointed. Some may say that this book has not withstood to tests of time since we have evolved with a greater respect for women than is described in this book. I don't see it that way. I see this book as a glimpse into the mind of a writer who lived at a time when artistic creativity was just about to explode. Heinlein had the brazenness to pull off a work that is uncompromising and epic in scope just as this creative explosion was taking place. For that, I believe it deserves our attention.	2001-01-21

Our company's middle management received free copies of this book, and I read it in about 15 minutes. First of all, this is one of the silliest and most simplified ways to label and identify &quot;achievers&quot; and &quot;failures&quot; in the business world that it's absolutely SHOCKING to me that so many people are falling for it's faux-wisdom. After I finished, I learned literally NOTHING from the book that I hadn't known from my first high school business class.<br />I call this book a &quot;pamphlet&quot; because it has a smaller page number than most children's picture books ... It is the ultimate rip-off.<br />I won't spoil the story for those of you who are dying to read it, but the crux of the book's theme is &quot;learn to adapt.&quot; It's something that everyone should already know, but the fact that it's consistently selling is probably an indication that most people DO NOT know this basic survival technique. It is amazing to me. It shows that the business world believes that the workforce cannot adapt, and that this tome of ultimate wisdom will break them out of their complacency.<br />If you can adapt to situations, if you can find ways to solve problems, if you are able to forge ahead into unknown territory, this book is a waste of time for you. It did not enlighten me, nor did it provide me with an ounce of information I hadn't been using already in my day-to-day work.	2001-01-21

I was so thrilled to see the sequel to the first Mouse Tales that I bought it immediately, and I was not disappointed. It goes further into Disneyland lore by touching on subjects the first book didn't mention. Maps of rides,  more gruesome tales, and even greater detail, make this yet another  must-buy for any Disneyland fan. Highly recommended.	2000-06-23

It details the history of the park, goes in depth on sexual shenanigans, Disneyland worker pranks, gruesome deaths over the years, and just about  every type of un-Disney-like behavior you could imagine. I thoroughly  enjoyed this as the perfect companion to a trip to the Magic Kingdom in  California. You simply won't know what it is like to work at the  &quot;Happiest Place on Earth&quot; without reading this book. Trust me.  It's a ride all on its own.	2000-06-23

I was looking for a book that showed every possible style of uniform used by German soldiers, officers, and civilians during WWII and this was the perfect book. Each uniform is painted from an actual photograph, and the  color schemes have been meticuluously researched to provide for a very good  resource. My only disappointment came from the fact that the book does not  include insignias, awards, or medals.	2000-04-17
US	50765446	R13PGNRC81ONTC	0785808442	125004502	Guns in Combat	Books	5	1	1	N	N	An Excellent Resource for Gun Enthusiasts or Researchers	I am a writer who needed a basic resource of combat weaponry for my library, and this was perfect. First of all, the book is full of color photography in a eye-catching graphical style. It features photos of the  weapons being used in actual combat situations, as well as in simple field  testing. Each weapon's brief history is discussed, a diagram of each is  featured with the innards exposed to illustrate firing mechanisms, and many  weapons have a step-by-step section on field stripping. For a neophyte,  like myself, this book is a great introduction to combat weapons and I  highly recommend it.	2000-03-09

It features most of his most popular works, and a biography of his life. It's a wonderful teaching tool, and it's also a great gift for  the artistically inclined. If you know a Dali fan, but you are working on a  budget, this is the perfect book for you.	1999-12-02

A previous reviewer complained about the book's ineffective qualities with science fiction, but it's the  writer's job to manipulate the basic conflict situations provided in the  book. This book will not give you EXACT PLOTS for your story. But it WILL  offer suggestions on directions you could take with your story. On Page  126, the second part of &quot;Conflict Situation - #953&quot; reads,  &quot;Jack, wanting peace and quiet, assumes a false identity and finds a  distant retreat.&quot; The retreat could be a dilapidated apartment in  Queens, a rural farm in Montana, or a distant planet in the Andromeda  Galaxy. Those creative souls who look at the contents of this book in  LITERAL terms will find nothing useful because it's only intended to spark  the writer's imagination, NOT provide easy plots for lazy writers. I think  this is a wonderful resource, and I recommend it to any aspiring, or  professional writer out there who needs a little nudge to get their story  moving.	1999-11-23
