I've read most of these comics in their original form, and was surprised when I picked this volume up by how... RIGHT... it felt.  This is a handsomely packaged product, a bit hefty perhaps, but it has the real feel, the sense of excitement and wonder that you'd hope for in an FF mega-reprint... Somehow it evokes the feel of the original books, the giddy, explosive creativity, the sense of vibrancy and sheer fun -- it's a lot like reading the old comics themselves.  The inclusion of the old letter columns is nice as well; too bad they didn't see fit to also inlude some of the other graphics of the time (Marvel monthly checklists, etc.) but overall, this is a really classy package.  I never went for the \\"Marvel Masterworks\\" series (although I appreciate the effort), but this gigantic tome has a special feel.  It's cool.	2005-10-05

The story revolves around one of the FF's ultimate baddies, Galactus the all-powerful planet eater... Johnny Storm has been conscripted as his latest \\"herald,\\" charged with finding him new planets to snarf down.

A little girl named Trixie starts to cry when she loses her stuffed animal and grows frustrated when she can't explain to her father what has happened.  Her father, who hadn't noticed that the bunny was missing, tries to calm her down by talking about other things, which frustrates the litttle girl even more.<br /><br />The psychology of the book is very realistic and simple: this is exactly the kind of thing that happens to small children before they can talk, and the book written as much for the parents as it is for the kids.  (My child points and smiles with satisfaction at the panel where the father realizes the mistake he's made, and Trixie has an I-told-you-so look on her face.  For my part, I try not to lose things... ever!  :-)<br /><br />It's also nice that the book is set in an urban environment (Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY)... A book that shows a walk to the laundromat may be a welcome change of pace for parents who live in cities and wonder when the heck they are ever going to get the chance to see a bunch of barnyard animals...<br /><br />In short, the appeal of this book is in understanding and validating the experience of children at a time in their lives when their voices are hard to hear.  If you like \\"Knuffle Bunny,\\" you might also want to search for the equally charming (but sadly out-of-print) \\"Hi!\\", written by Ann Herbert Scott, with pictures by Glo Coalson.  That book is searching for as well.  Both books may help you understand what it feels like to be so little and have it be so hard to get adults to understand you.	2005-07-22

This board book features twenty-six sliding panels that illustrate the letters of the alphabet with attractive, well-drawn animal pictures: A for Alligator, B for Bear...etc.  This one is a favorite at our household... The biggest selling point of this book is its durability: most pop-up books and panel books are easily ruined by overeager or rambunctious children.  This one, however, has sliding panels that are encased in tough, solid cardboard pages, and is almost impossible for small children (ages 0-2?) to tear apart.  The sliding action helps develop eye-to-hand coordination, and the panels move easily from side to side, avoiding the frustration that some movable parts can create.  The pictures are nice, some of the animals are unusually named (urial and xenops, for example...) and once your kid gets the hang of it, he or she can be left alone to explore the book with no fear of it winding up in pieces.

And having read it, I'm looking forward to the rest of his \\"Daredevil\\" stories...!<br /><br />I think this was the start of his stint scripting DD (in issues 16-19) and while the overall story has a bit of a been-there, agonized-over-that feel to it (a child abuse victim goes into catatonic withdrawl, until the adults can catch up to what he's been through...), Bendis manages to hit the right notes to give this story some punch.  Bendis and illustrator David Mack work together on many levels, with the art complimenting and commenting on the text and the story arc in various ways... Mack slips and slides between a photorealistic presentation and a more disjointed chicken-stratch style that accentuates the chaotic inner dialogue of Timmy, the little boy who's mental health is at risk.  The artsiness of the illustration is distracting through most of the book -- Mack's work calls a lot of attention to itself, and you are frequently made aware of his Technique, with a capital \\"T\\", but in the revelatory climactic sequence, the interplay of the constrasting styles really pays off.  The story is told from the vantage point of newspaper reporter Ben Urich, so there's not a lot of the Matt Murdoch/Daredevil character in here, which actually is fine; it's a nice change of pace.<br /><br />Overall, this a good story, well worth checking out, and an appropriate entry point into the Bendis-penned DD storyline.

This is an entertaining, intelligently written, fast-paced comic, featuring the return of The Catwoman after a self-imposed retirement.  The book gives some of her back-story, introducing James Stark, the man who helped train her as a thief, and also includes a side plot with detective Slam Bradley, which intersects with the storyline in the \\"Catwoman\\" series written by Ed Brubaker.  (The crossover doesn't quite jive with what's going on in that book, where Catwoman has basically gone straight, and has taken Slam in as part of her Scooby gang, but it's okay: Bradley is a great character, and it's nice to see him here as well...)<br /><br />Writer/artist Darwyn Cooke is one of the best storytellers working in comics these days, and this is another fine offering by him... just wish there were more books like it!

It has a lot of the same elements -- quick action, somewhat thin plots, supervillans you don't really care that much about but look forward to seeing defeated (Titannus, the mutant kid named Paul) and lots and lots of Marvel superdudes, with Spiderman as the focal point.  So far so good.  The artwork by Scott Kolins is nice -- realistic, but not filled with fetishistic, super-exaggerated body-builder muscles... The introduction of an evil, alternate-reality Iron Man is fun... he's the bad guy that gives this book its bite.  In short, this isn't a like a great work of art or anything, but it was a fun read.

It's all good stuff; not too substantive on the writing side of things, but nice light fun nonetheless.  The best part is Carmine Infantino's artwork, which was highly imitative of newspaper cartoonist Milton Canniff, with a rugged yet stylish flair -- very different from the fluid, slapdash style Infantino adopted later in the '50s and '60s.  I really enjoyed reading this one, and found it less repetitive than other volumes in the series... It's also nice to see one of the lesser, neglected Golden Age characters finally get their due, particularly one as foxy as the Lana Turner-ish Black Canary...

Woodall, who was entirely ignorant of Brazilian popular music, had never heard of Buarque or the MPB scene he helped pioneer.  To the author, writing about this Brazilian guy just represented a chance to bluff his way through to another paycheck.  The two of them hit it off, however, and while researching the story, Woodall fell under the spell of Buarque's muse.  Seeing Buarque and, later, Caetano Veloso, performing in London -- amid adoring audiences packed with fervent Brazilian fans -- clinched it for Woodall, and he soon became a diehard fan.  The article led to an invitation to visit Buarque in Rio de Janeiro, which Woodall accepted, and timed to coincide with the 1994 Rio Carnaval.  what started off as a journalistic lark led to an extraordinary series of events: over the next couple of years Woodall was able to meet not only Buarque, but Veloso as well, and other superstars such as Gilberto Gil, Gal Costa and even the legendary Antonio Carlos Jobim, not long before the great bossa nova composer passed away.  It's something of an innocents abroad adventure: Woodall steps over a few of the gaps in Brazilian musical history (when explaining the role Roberto Carlos played in the early '60s, for example, he doesn't seem to be aware that Carlos was in fact playing teenybopper rock music, and not the syrupy romantic stuff he later became known for...)  and seems almost to blunder into the presence of greatness.  That being said, however, this book includes fine, cogent narratives, particularly of the lives of Chico Buarque and Caetano Veloso, and is a fine introduction to the history of mdern Brazilian pop, as well as a charmingly unglamorized travelogue of modern Brazil, and an exploration of how the yearly Carnaval celebrations have become a routinized tourist-dominated event.<br />Some of passages may evoke resentment or ire: Woodall's frank ogling of scantily clad, robust Brazilian natives and his blunt appraisals of the state of their society may seem patronizing, although as an outsider, I have to say they have the ring of honesty and accuracy.  Most of all, Woodall ably conveys the sense of discovery, mystery and fervor that Brazilian music can inspire: he isn't slavish in his adulation, and is willing to dismiss beloved artists such as Djavan or Milton Nascimento, simply because their music doesn't appeal to him, but he is a fan.  And, as someone who seems to share a lot in common with Woodall, aesthetically speaking, I find his unglamorized approach pretty refreshing.n Brazil, and an exploration of how the yearly Carnaval celebrations have become a routinized tourist-dominated event.  <br />Some of passages may evoke resentment or ire: Woodall's frank ogling of scantily clad, robust Brazilian natives and his blunt appraisals of the state of their society may seem patronizing, although as an outsider, I have to say they have the ring of honesty and accuracy.

All three participants are people of immense courage -- photographer Simeon Hutner, for being able to stand behind the camera and capture the struggle of his family, his sister Elizabeth, whose poems eloquently describe not only the big-picture emotions of those faced with the unfairness of tragedy, but also the little details that make it that much more tragic, and finally her son, Sam, whose trusting, accepting, haunting gaze penetrates past the pages directly into our souls.

One of the poorest and most insulting product decisions ever made in the history of comic book reprints was Marvel's inexplicable cheapskate-ism with this extensive series of colorless repressings of the great, old Marvel titles from the early 'Sixties superhero revival. Yeah, it's great to have the stories back in print, but good lord, what were they thinking?  Don't fool yourself: reading old Marvel comics in black & white is not really the same thing as reading old Marvel comics. The original colors were so vibrant and unrestrained! The books were so much fun to look at and so sensuous to behold! By contrast, this is like reading those shabby Mexican or UK pulps from the 1970s that treated the same material with such blatant disregard. Hopefully folks in the know will still buy the infinitely nicer, full-color \\"Marvel Masterworks\\" reprints instead & let Marvel know that quality and respect for the material does matter.

Chapters on samba, bossa nova, tropicalia, forro and jazz include focused biographical sketches of dozens of key artists, as well as succinct historical information about the progress of Brazilian music from its European and African folk roots into its bewildering and often beautiful modern offshoots.  The book's focus is nonpartisan: although there is plenty of room for aesthetic criticism within the various styles, the authors generally hold their preferences and dislikes to themselves.  They do, however, give readers a good sense of which recordings might be best to check out -- an invaluable service considering how little of Brazil's vast musical output makes it to the United States.

Christopher Dunn, who co-edited &quot;Brazilian Popular Music &amp; Globalization,&quot; skillfully combines hard academic research with a relatively light, conversational prose.  This is dense yet captivating material, as Dunn deftly explores the historical and philosophical connections to tropicalia -- an art movement that was originally conceived as cross-genre and multi-media -- and previous Brazilian movements such as modernismo, which was Brazil's homegrown 1920s variant of the &quot;futurist&quot; philosophy that swept through Europe in the early 20th Century.  Dunn also deftly tells the story of tropicalia's explosive growth as a subversive, psychedelic musical genre, and the harsh political repression it was met with by the dictatorship which held power from 1964 to 1985.  This is a vital book, of interest to the many newfound fans of this wild musical style, or to art historians tracking the worldwide path of dada-ism and surrealist art.

The introductory chapters are a little slow-going, as Roberts twists and gyrates to avoid anticipated critical jabs.  His qualifications and defensiveness may make sense to enthnomusicological insiders, but to the average reader, they seem fairly unnecessary, or at least a bit hard to follow.  After that, though, the book picks up steam and is quite captivating.  The main point of contention is the fascinating (and convincing) idea that *_Latin American_*  influences were every bit as present at the inception of American jazz music as were African ones.  In Roberts' world, the term &quot;latin jazz&quot; isn't exactly redundant, but it is misleading: Latin Jazz didn't spring forth in the 'Forties and 'Fifties out of whole cloth.  Rather, Latin American influences on North American musicians can be found as far back as the Antebellum period, and are present at all the major junctures of jazz history.  In addition to combing through historical records (such as newspapers, journals, and the records sheet music publishers), Roberts offers a clear critical narrative of the cross-pollination of Latin American dance music and Afro-European jazz.  He touches on the major trends and significant collaborations of the last 120 years: ragtime, the tango, the rumba, the thunderous New York &quot;CuBop&quot; scene of the 1940s, and of course the bossa nova craze of the 1960s, and the gradual formalization of &quot;Latin Jazz&quot; as a genre.  Along the way he sheds some light on famous artists such as Machito, Dizzy Gillespie and Tito Puente, as well as dimly-remembered pioneers like Antonio Machin, Don Azpiazu and gives favorable nods towards big banders who &quot;got&quot; the drift of  the oncoming tide of Latin American crossover.

This is an English translation of his autobiography, a densely-written, super-intellectual, but also quite charming and down-to-earth account of the &quot;heroic years&quot; of the tropicalia movement.  Veloso gives an intimate, immensely informative account of Brazilian music, from the pre-bossa &quot;radio singers&quot; he grew up with to the intense ideological rivalries between the hippie-ish tropicalia artists and the left-wing party-liners of the bossa nova crowd.  The book is also a memoir of life under the Brazilian military dictatorship which took power in 1964, eventually sending Veloso and Gil (and countless other artists) into political exile, while attempting to censor their work and silence their voices. The role of the artist in all aspects of life -- social, spiritual and aesthetic -- resonates throughout this book, as Veloso gives an invaluable insider's view of an artistic movement that changed the course of Brazilian culture.  This book basically ends in the early 1970s... it would be great if he could follow up with a second volume exploring the growth (although some might call it decline) of Brazilian music in the decades that followed.

Disillusionment and moral compromise ensues. Everything starts off just fine, with our hero club-hopping in an effort to sign his favorite band. Flanagan's real-life experience (as VP of VH-1) lends the right feel to the subterranean backbiting between rival record label execs, and the routine backslapping and insincere ego-stroking that are the industry's life blood are deftly drawn. The book stumbles, though, as Flanagan forces his characters out of New York and into an overdrawn, Hunter S. Thompson-ish romp in Brazil, which ends in tears and provides a flimsy pretext for one character to pursue a corporate coup. Frankly, I would have found it more interesting if he had kept things on a more realistic level, and relied on the petty personality wars of the entertainment industry to propel events... I'm sure there would be enough unbelievable material right there, and it would have been ultimately more rewarding for the reader. All-in-all, though, the book is fine, and for plebes like me who are eager for a glimpse into the world of corporate culture-making this may be an instructive foray. Speaking through his characters, Flanagan gets off a few understated broadsides at the sad state of post-'60s corporate culture-making, and the way in which record producing has become strictly a joylessly cynical, money-making proposition. So is there a happy ending? Hey - read it and find out!	2001-08-29

A really fab book which fills a big void in the world of music guides.  Very comprehensive -- covers earnest Sixties folk, acoustic blues, acoustic guitarists, bluegrass, modern Americana, some gospel, some Hawaiian music, and more.  Especially strong on its many Celtic/British folk revival entries and historical overviews.  A little too dismissive of some of the early '70s songwriters, and skips many children's music artists (Ella Jenkins, sure -- but shame on you for omitting Barry Polisar!)  I'm a little puzzled as to why there are so many country artists in here, especially when MusicHound already has a separate volume devoted to twangsters -- if they're going to include honkytonkers like Ernest Tubb or Johnny &amp; Jack in this book, why not everyone else?  But overall this is an outstanding reference work.  The resource appendices are particularly nice, including guides to other publications, artist websites and a short-list set of album recommendations.  Companion CD provided by Rounder/Philo has only seven tracks, which seems a bit stingy, and only includes contemporary artists.	2001-08-10

But for blues fans, the muscular power and driving passion of the bluesmen is enough by itself, and this collection of articles and interviews profiling many of the genre's greatest players, is manna from heaven for the folks who could care less what happened after Elvis shook his little heinie on the Ed Sullivan show.  This is a  classicist's view of the blues -- standardbearers such as Otis Rush, Muddy Waters and BB King get multiple entries, wild West Coast and Texas bluesmen like T-Bone Walker and Clarence Gatemouth Brown also get their propers, and while the main emphasis is on the dudes who plugged in, acoustic players such as Fred McDowell also get a nod or two.  The book draws on a variety of writers, and reflects a variety of interviewing and narrative styles -- most of the material originally appeared in &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine, but while some technical points are investigated, the book is an even better source of information about the players themselves -- their personalities, their stories, their world view.  A true blues fan should enjoy this book quite a bit!	2001-08-10

Various contributors tackle the complexities of selling hybridized &quot;world&quot; music in a voracious, globalized world economy, and examine the ongoing stylistic, philosophical and generational tensions between different groups in Brazilian popular music.  Particular emphasis is given to the &quot;tropicalia&quot; scene, including several chapters on Os Mutantes and an excellent essay by Caetano Veloso regarding the mixed meaning of Carmen Miranda's legacy to the '60s generation.  Working upwards from a standard-issue Marscusian, colonial/postcolonial cultural critique, this book takes its cues from the Brazilian philosopher Osvaldo de Andrade, whose theories on &quot;cultural cannibalism&quot; were a key influence on the tropicalistas, and explains how the inclusive guerilla surrealism of the tropicalistas bypassed the stormy ideological divide between the left-wing cultural nationalism of the early MPB crowd and the vacant, prefab commercialism of the &quot;jovem guarda&quot; rock scene.  Not content to lionize the tropicalistas, the book also shows how the '60s radicals later entered the status quo, and how their lofty superstardom has been rejected (or resented) by younger Brazilians, who came to see them as a fusty cultural aristocracy.  A bit dense and mildly over-academic at times, but deeply fascinating and insightful, this is an invaluable resource for understanding the history of Brazilian pop, and for examining the metamorphoses of &quot;local&quot; music in a global market.  Highly recommended!!	2001-08-10

Kraftwerk and Depeche Mode are included as representatives of the old school -- no one remotely less commerical is given consideration. Most of the book is made up of interviews with his idols, but even these are less than gripping, being mainly preoccupied with fetishistic technical detail (-- what kind of filters do you use?  --what range of equalization do you prefer? etc.)  I had hoped, since the book was geared towards the pioneers of the genre, that it would deal more with its philosophies, rather than its techniques: Why choose to work in a medium that is deliberately mechanical and artificial?  How does the human element come into play? How assiduously do the artists include or mask its presence?  Sadly, these are issues that this book doesn't address in a  meaningful way.  Rule takes it as a given that the aesthetics of the genre are accepted and need no exploration, and thus he seems to have missed several golden opportunities in his face-to-face meetings with the very artists who might shed some insight into what makes this potentially remote music so compelling to so many people.	2001-08-10

A masterful work by John Storm Roberts, whose early-'70s books on Latin American music were &quot;world music&quot; landmarks, and whose Original Music record label has reissued some of the most precious African and Latin American popular and traditional music one is ever likely to hear.  The introductory chapters are slow-going, as Roberts twists and gyrates to avoid anticipated critical jabs.  His qualifications and defensiveness may make sense to enthnomusicological insiders, but to the average reader, they seem fairly unnecessary, or at least a bit hard to follow.  After that, though, the book picks up steam and is quite captivating.  The main point of contention is the fascinating (and convincing) idea that Latin American influences were every bit as present at the inception of American jazz music as were African ones.  In Roberts' world, the term &quot;latin jazz&quot; isn't exactly redundant, but it is misleading: Latin Jazz didn't spring forth in the 'Forties and 'Fifties out of whole cloth.  Rather, Latin American influences on North American musicians can be found as far back as the Antebellum period, and are present at all the major junctures of jazz history.  In addition to combing through historical records (such as newspapers, journals, and the records sheet music publishers), Roberts offers a clear critical narrative of the cross-pollination of Latin American dance music and Afro-European jazz.  He touches on the major trends and significant collaborations of the last 120 years: ragtime, the tango, the rumba, the thunderous New York &quot;CuBop&quot; scene of the 1940s, and of course the Brazilian bossa nova craze of the 1960s, and the gradual formalization of &quot;Latin Jazz&quot; as a genre.  Along the way he sheds some light on famous artists such as Machito, Dizzy Gillespie and Tito Puente, as well as dimly-remembered pioneers like Antonio Machin, Don Azpiazu and gives favorable nods towards big banders who &quot;got&quot; the drift of  the oncoming tide of Latin American crossover.   Along with Sue Steward's &quot;Musica!,&quot; this book can go a long way to fill in the gaps for folks who are new to the sound, as well as those who want to dig deep down.  Recommended!!	2001-08-10

The low-key, down home alternative to George Simon's often-lauded &quot;Big Bands,&quot; this has a charming, almost DIY, quality to it. The graphic layout is pretty funky, but there are more and better photographs than in Simon's book. Also the writing is less jaded and more breathless, conveying the author's continued enthusiasm for his favorite artists of year gone by.  Most significantly, Walker puts all the artists on an equal footing, listing them from A to Z, whereas Simon makes a big distinction between &quot;major&quot; artists, and lesser or non-swing musicians, shunting them to separate sections in the back of the book.  Both books are informative, but I have more of a soft spot in my heart for this one -- I'd recommend it first!	2001-08-10

It had gotten such great press when it came out -- with big write-ups in the &quot;New York Times&quot; and elsewhere -- but frankly, I found the style and grammar so convoluted that I could hardly understand it.  Cantwell's overly-academic prose is so dense and thicketed that halfway through I realized I had absolutely no idea what his book was about.  Something about the American folk  revival... but what exactly was he trying to say?  Cantwell, a former '60s folkie who teaches American Studies at UNC Chapel Hill, applies a nearly impenetrable acadamese to his history(?)/analysis(?)/deconstruction(?) of the folk revival, but seems unable to rise above the terminology and crowded syntax he's adopted.  His writing has a piled-on, house-of-cards style, full of incredible run-on sentences and needless verbal transpositions that make practically every sentence, paragraph and chapter difficult to follow.  In short:  arrrrrrgh!!!  The most frustrating aspect is the boggling lack of narrative skills: Cantwell sets out to tell stories and convey experiences, but inevitably gets balled up in unreasonably convoluted, digressive rhetoric.  Maybe I'm just a big dummy and can't understand all that smart-feller, egghead stuff...  or maybe this guy needs a more forceful editor.	2001-08-10

She's just an academic, fercrissakes, writing for an academic audience!!  I'm sure she was just as punk as you are, it's just that when you're writing your graduate thesis (which is what this book originally was) you kinda have to be a bit, um, academic.  She does an admirable job translating the anti-authoritarian, pro-artist ethos of punk into scholarly jargon -- the trouble with this book isn't that she didn't know what she was talking about, it's just that hearing it all expalined so clinically is nowhere near as fun as playing a Sex Pistols album at full blast.

An awesome, all-purpose, up-to-date guide to the alternative country &quot;scene&quot;, this includes profiles of about five hundred bands, both big and small, with special emphasis on local scenes.  It's an amazing resource, sure to fill in numerous blanks for just about any reader.  Goodman's writing is straightforward, and not overly concerned with the &quot;look, I'm a postgraduate!&quot; rhetorical flashiness which plagues many contemporary music reviews.  Let me put it this way, if I had a staff here at Slipcue, I'd hire this guy as a writer.  Of course, with books like this, it's fun to flip around checking on bands you already know about... and the good news here is that Goodman is pretty thorough.  For example, I looked up The Movie Stars, a Bay Area band whose late-'80s album preceded most of the current wave of twangsters by several years.  They didn't have their own entry, but were mentioned under the listing of Red Meat, which is sort of a reconstituted version of the old band.  Other '80s pioneers are included as well, though things start to get a little fuzzier and less consistent in the '70s  (the Blue Ridge Rangers get listed, but what about Larry Hosford?).  One problem I have, though, is the use of scene-specific catch phrases to denote &quot;styles&quot; of music... for example, Sun Volt as &quot;No Depression&quot; music, or any of the bands on Bloodshot as &quot;insurgent country&quot;.  Yeah, sometimes the things bands (or labels) call their music are cute, but they aren't necessarily that descriptive.  But maybe I'm just being too crabby.  Goodman also includes listings for radio stations, e-zines, websites and publications related to the current Twang-craze... obviously many of these listings will be quickly out of date, but we can hope that just means another, bigger, better edition will follow...	2001-08-10

I feel somewhat vindicated by this book's firm assertions that Holiday was not, in fact, a downcast performer.  Like the other volumes in  Schirmer Books' excellent &quot;Companion&quot; series, this anthology draws on a wide range of sources, including artist interviews and autobiographies, contemporary newspaper reviews and formal music criticism.  This patchwork of Holiday's admirers and intimates creates a warm and frequently contradictory portrait of the world's greatest jazz vocalist.  An extremely vulnerable yet extremely toughened, capable artist, Holiday's life is often seen through the filter of her tragic drug abuse, which led to her complete physical breakdown and death in 1959.  This sordid reduction of Holiday's life has led many of her biographers to protectively soften or cover up aspects of her personality, which in turn has contributed to the confusion about her life.  Editor Leslie Gourse skillfully weaves through these various accounts, offering illuminating commentary as to their relative strengths and blind spots.  Included are entries by musicians such as Buck Clayton, producers John Hammond, Milt Gabler and Leonard Feather, and a host of journalists and biographers, including Gourse's own essay, &quot;There Was No Middle Ground With Billie Holiday&quot;.  An invaluable resource for anyone who wants to find out more about Lady Day, her influence on modern vocals, and her sad yet glorious life. Highly recommended.	2001-08-10

Despite the years-old bust in the lounge music boom, this is a fun and informative volume.  My instincts tell me to check all critical thinking at the door,  but I just can't help myself.  Written by many of the same folks who valiantly strove to make easy listening a &quot;thing,&quot; this book is pretty footloose and fancy free with what it chooses to call lounge (&quot;... whatever sounds good when you're drinking a martini...&quot;)  Latin dance music is sampled (Perez Prado, Desi Arnez, Mario Bauza) as are some relatively haphazard additions from the world of soul music (Isaac Hayes? sure, I guess... but Erykah Badu??).  Of course, anything croony or well-known from the big band era is up for grabs (but why no Glen Gray, Ruth Etting or Paul Whiteman, if you're going to include all those other old-timers?)... There are all sorts of questionable entries form the world of rock (&quot;... but why Morrissey, the Beautiful South, Pizzicato Five and the Beach Boys and not so-and-so... ???&quot;) -- and practically *nothing* by John Zorn or the Boredoms (what's up with that???).  Despite the perversity of presentation, this book is pretty groovy: who else is going to steer you towards Blossom Dearie or Dinah Washington these days?  The companion CD is one of the better freebies in the MusicHound series, a sampler of the last six volumes in Capitol's exhaustive Ultra-Lounge series, and one of the very few such MusicHound discs to include an adequate number of tracks.

The scope of the book is very well-rounded, including information on often-neglected &quot;sweet&quot; band musicians such as Isham Jones, along with pre-big band acts like  Ted Lewis.  The downside is that Simon -- a jazz music critic for &quot;Metronome&quot; magazine during the big band years -- wears his insider credentials on his sleeves, and is a bit of an  insufferable name-dropper.

Scott Yanow, the editor of the &quot;All Music Guide To Jazz,&quot; is probably one of the most readable jazz critics around.

Yanow covers all the bases: the big bandleaders, the important musicians (broken down by type of instrument) and even a section on composers and arrangers.  Even when he's talking about unfamiliar artists, he knows how to stir your curiousity (Cab Calloway had a famous older sister...!?), and the book has a lot to offer to a wide variety of readers.  Hundreds of albums are rated on a 1 to 10 scale, and if anything Yanow is a little more charitable here than in his &quot;AMG Jazz&quot; reviews...

As the main creative director of the Hayride, Logan's path intersected those of many top-flight hick musicians, including Webb, Johnny Horton, Johnny Cash, Kitty Wells, Jim Reeves and a slew of others whose careers took off when they became regulars on the show.  This book concentrates the bulk of its effort towards two oft-mythologized stars whose lives are amply documented elsewhere - Hank Williams and Elvis Presley -- and while it's cool to get insights from a person who helped start both their careers, in a sense the book feels like a missed opportunity, since Logan must have had plenty more to say about the &quot;early&quot; days when country music made the transition from rinky-dink local operations into a major industry with a nationwide scope.  He broke into the business at the tail end of a period when all the action was on local radio stations, and helped usher in the era when things became increasingly professionalized and big-league.  While the book is very readable, it's unfortunate that Logan and his ghost-writer, Bill Sloan, didn't see fit to explore &quot;the old days&quot; a little bit more, and bring out more of the flavor of what the hick music business was like back when.  It's understandable that they would emphasize the bankable big boys like Elvis and Hank, but considering how much has already been written about them, the &quot;witness to history&quot; approach doesn't add as much to the historical lore as more under-the-radar observations might have.  In short, it would've been cool if the story had been more about Logan himself, and the world he saw, and not simply about the stars that lived in it.  Still, Hayride enthusiasts should definitely check this one out!bout Logan himself, and the world he saw, and not simply about the stars that lived in it.

This husband/wife team made themselves into a franchise as historians and commentators for the TNN country cable network...  Here they present the female side of the country equation, moving historically from the pre-recording days back in Hog Hollar, to the gradual entry of women into the growing &quot;hillbilly&quot; music industry, and finally into the hallowed halls of the Grand Ole Opry and the mainstream of commercial country.  The writing is generally good, and the scope of the book is impressive.  The authors pay special attention to the contradictions of women's place in early country -- they were important keepers of folk traditions, but not allowed to perform professionally -- as well as to the persistent stereotyping and creative restrictions placed on them my the Nashville establishment.  This book may be a bit exhaustive, but it's an awesome bit of pop scholarship.  Besides, they turned me onto the foul-mouthed mid-'50s proto-rockabilly filly, Charlene Arthur, which was worth the price of admission alone.  Highly recommended!	2001-08-10

Actually, it's a rather heart-wrenching story: despite the phenomenal success of her family's kickass country band (Rose Maddox and the Maddox Brothers), Rose herself had a terribly hard life.  Shrewishly dominated by her mother, screwed over by her first husband, and unable to sit still long enough to enjoy her family life, she struggled for decades to try and find equilibrium and independence.  Reading about such a talented person being so unable to assert herself for so long is a rather painful experience.  Yet the book is also a compelling history of one of the great hillbilly bands of all time: beloved by country and rockabilly fans alike, the Maddoxes were one of the most popular hard country acts of the 1940s and early '50s.  They played everything in hyperdrive and did much to sculpt the sound of rocknroll,  as well as the late '50s hard country revival in Bakersfield.  Whiteside does a great job conveying what it was like working in the honkytonk bars, and the informal nature of the scene back then.  Sadly, Rose Maddox passed away in early 1998, but this book is a fine tribute.	2001-08-10

She's just an academic, fercrissakes, writing for an academic audience!!  I'm sure she was just as punk as you are, it's just that when you're writing your graduate thesis (which is what this book originally was) you kinda have to be a bit, um, academic.  She does an admirable job translating the anti-authoritarian, pro-artist ethos of punk into scholarly jargon -- the trouble with this book isn't that she didn't know what she was talking about, it's just that hearing it all expalined so clinically is nowhere near as fun as playing a Sex Pistols album at full blast. It's worth checking out, if you want to see how DIY translates into PhD.	2001-08-10

A pivotal look at the development of Latin American popular music, novelist Alejo Carpentier's historical tract was originally published in 1946, and came out of raging, decades-long intellectual debates about the nature of Cuban and Latin American culture.  This is the first English translation of this work and includes a lengthy introductory essay by the editor, explaining the author's role in the Cuban intelligensia... &quot;Music In Cuba&quot; was an attempt to settle some of the controversies about the &quot;legitimacy&quot; of Cuban music, and to resolve the apparent differences between tony, Europhilic art music and the grittier rural style that came to dominate the island's popular imagination.  It's an intellectual, somewhat egghead-y book, but rich in cultural depth... The new foreward is also very valuable, giving proper context to Carpentier and his work, and a sense of the academic and philosophical life of Cubans abroad and at home in the early 20th Century.	2001-08-10

It's a bit bulky, with a layout  which is a bit flat.  Still, it includes entries on some artists which other guides may omit; the discographies are a bit suspect, though, particularly when it comes to little things like getting the titles right.  You could opt for the newer, sexier country guides, but this one still has something to offer, particularly the longer, more narrative biographical entries.	2001-08-10

However, the emphasis is clearly more contemporary than historical -- for example, the reference sidebars are entitled &quot;Word Up!&quot;, which seems tacky as well as rather dated.  Modern artists such as Bobby Brown, Sheena Easton, and Toni Braxton get equal -- if not superior -- billing with soul music touchstones such as Otis Redding, Sam Cooke, and the Stax/Volt and Motown crowds.  Very few pre-rock artists are included -- Cab Calloway and Big Joe Turner make it in, for example, but not Buddy Johnson or Floyd Dixon, and several classic 60s soul stars such as Garnett Mimms are also omitted.  Finally, while most of the big-name blues shouters such as Wynonie Harris, Amos Milburn and Louis Jordan have entries, practically none of their great gospel counterparts are included.  This really is a disgrace, as well as a short-sighted, culturally revisionist nod to contemporary tastes (which do not embrace the preachin' and shoutin' religious side of African-American music).  Rest assured that without Bessie Griffin, Clara Ward, the Soul Stirrers, or Rev. James Cleveland, there would never have been a BeBe Winans, Mariah Carey or Aretha Franklin -- much less a Parliament, Lauryn Hill or KRS-1.  As with other MusicHound books, this also provides useful appendices, including fan sites, etc., and the companion CD is a nice (if stingy) sampler of some of gems from the Mercury Records catalog.  But if Wu Tang or Billy Oceans are not your &quot;R&amp;B&quot; thing, you may wish to be wary of this tome.	2001-08-10

By definition, that makes its focus fairly mainstream, not that that really detracts much from its value as a reference work (especially considering how snobbish we've gotten about all those bloated, scary AOR bands from the '70s).

A thoroughly charming and authoritative history of Brazilian popular music, this book documents the rise of bossa nova, tracking the careers of Joao Gilberto, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Vinicius De Moraes, Nara Leao and others in a gossipy, informal narrative that's a delight to read.  Castro brings the mythic figures of Brazil back down to human scale, poking fun at their humanity, their foibles and years of obscurity, while also pointing out their sheer brilliance, and the adoration that Brazilians feel for their music.  The chatty, informal tone adds a nice hometown touch that lets you feel as if you were standing on the corner yourself when that gal from Ipanema walked by, cracking jokes with the rest of the fellas.  This book is also notable for its emphasis on the now-neglected figures of the great &quot;radio singers,&quot; who ruled the public heart in the decades before bossa hit - legendary figures such as Lucio Alves, Aloysio Oliveira, Orlando Silva, Dick Farney and Sylvia Telles whose stars have faded, but are compelling nonetheless.  Castro has complete command of his subject, but doesn't feel stuffy or preachy at all.  An outstanding book, and required reading for anyone looking for a deeper knowledge of Brazilian culture.	2001-08-10

The writing is almost as dogged and linear as Tubb was during his years on the road -- not terribly elegant, literary or evocative, but the research is solid, including countless interviews with band members, industry movers, and Tubb relations.  An authoritative resource for anyone who would like to find out how Tubb helped form the sound of hard country honkytonk in the early '40s, and how he later helped boost the careers of musicians such as Hank Snow, Hank Thompson and Loretta Lynn, and how Nashville eventually let him slide out of sight.  Many of the details seems too depressing and tawdry to me, but it's still the story of a great man's life...	2001-08-10

Like the magazine, this anthology of artist profiles is full of insights and fraught with distractions.  I suppose I should start by coming out with my confession that I have  always had, well, some slight **problems** with &quot;No Depression&quot;... To wit, I (and a few other people) have long regarded the magazine as more of a booster society for twangcore than as a vehicle for critical commentary... the reviews are generally non-critical and often adulatory of even the most marginally talented of bands.  Such boosterism is all very well and fine -- it's a matter of preference, and in some ways is a refreshing change of pace from the snarkiness of say, &quot;SPIN&quot; or various indie-rock zines.  But at the same time, there is something to be said for offering sincere criticism: if no one will point out the flaws in an artform, how can it be expected to grow?  In a similar vein, the editorial slant at ND seems to encourage loose, personalized, expressive writing from its dozens of freelance contributors.  Writers regularly interject themselves into their stories, or go out of their way to use quirky -- even show-offy -- phraseology and other purposefully-amatuerish techniques that come out of the 'zine ethos.  At times this is rewarding to the reader.  More often than not, though, I find it distracting and difficult to get around: if you're writing about Hank Williams, then tell me about Hank Williams; don't try to write a Homeric ode in his praise.  The editorial hand seems light at &quot;No Depression&quot; -- perhaps they're just unwilling to offend  contributors by offering actual guidance -- but they also seem to overvalue dense or lengthy prose as a way to persuade the reader of the gravity of what is being discussed.  Ironically, in this regard &quot;No Depression&quot; has little to worry about -- it is clearly the leader of the pack in the current twang craze, so as music historians of the future look back at today's country-roots revival, ND will doubtless take on the authoritative stature that it tries so hard to project in the present day.  For those of us in the here and now, we can amuse ourselves with the many insights into the artists we've come to know and love... For example, Allison Stewart's wry presentation of just what a pompous dweeb Will Oldham (of Palace/Brothers/Songs) actually is, or editor Grant Alden's hopelessly florid, but wonderfully informative, profile of alt-country legend Chip Taylor.  For the very best of this beloved magazine, this is the book for you.btless take on the authoritative stature that it tries so hard to project in the present day.

With all the other country guides out there, this faces pretty stiff competition.  Its advantages include a more open -- though slightly diffuse -- layout, explicit album recommendations (ranging from one to five bones, and &quot;woof!&quot; for complete dogs) and an excellent Resources section.  Appendices include: movies with country themes (courtesy of the VideoHound guide), fan clubs and websites, recommended publications and radio stations, as well as chronological listings of industry awards, and finally, the Hound's patented cross-reference lists in the back.  The companion CD, however, is rather disappointing: an eight-song sampler of contemporary artists on Mercury/Nashville.	2001-08-10

Weighing in at a mere 176 pages, this snappy little volume sure packs a wallop!  This is the Cuban music equivalent of McGowan &amp; Pessanha's &quot;Brazilian Sound,&quot; but with more dynamic layout, and exceptionally precise writing.  &quot;Musica!&quot; features several geographically-centered chapters, exploring salsa traditions in Cuba, Puerto Rico, Columbia and, of course, the explosion of modern salsa in New York and Miami.  Brief overviews of the style's spread into Europe and Africa, and a look at modern salsa-pop crossovers.  Each chapter features a central narrative, along with numerous sidebars that at first might seem unwieldy and distracting, but are tremendously informative and fun.  These include profiles of artists ranging from the superstars to the obscure and the forgotten -- Tito Puente, Ruben Blades and Celia Cruz share the dance floor along with The Mambo Aces, Jesus Colon, and Maria Teresa Vera. The writing is remarkably compact and informative.  Steward is especially effective at describing musical concepts and performance techniques, details that other writers often flounder over while trying to explain.  The historical photographs, engravings and album reproductions are also illuminating and gorgeous-- laid out in crazy-quilt fashion, the colorful artwork alone makes this book a must for latin music fans.  There are parts of this book which felt too short, but as an easily-assimilated guide to the music of four continents, this is pretty hard to beat.  Highly recommended!	2001-08-10

Pop culture critic Marcus weaves the history of the Sex Pistols -- and their disasterous final tour to America -- in with sideways social analyses and neo-surrealist &quot;Situationism&quot;.

In part, this was due to the style's runaway success, what with the Eagles and Linda Ronstadt's domination of the soft pop market during the height of the disco years.  Country rock has often been hard to pin down, though -- are we talking about the sleek Top 40 stuff, or the scrappy hippie bands that would just as soon pick up a sitar as a pedal steel?  This book is a well-written, highly readable look at the history of this rather amorphous subgenre, spanning from Buck Owens' Fender-bending twanginess to the present-day musings of bands like the Jayhawks, Steve Earle and Lucinda Williams.  The bulk of the attention is on the 'Seventies, when country-rock was a marketable niche, and Einarson does a great job fleshing out the personalities and development of the scene, including interviews with numerous artists who may seen peripheral or obscure to us now.  There's also the inevitable eulogizing of the great Gram Parsons, amid a detailed portrait of  SoCal's longhair hipster hordes, with a rich play-by-play of the artistic development of the Byrds, Michael Nesmith and Ricky Nelson, giving credence to a wealth of hippie-era experimentation which if often written off as indulgent or ill-formed, and helping frame its importance to the growth of the present-day &quot;young country&quot; Nashville crossover sound.  Einarson's exploration of the deep interconnections between hard country and early rock is a little facile -- he points to Elvis and Hank Williams, where pre-rock artists such as Hank Penny and Moon Mullins might have been a little more instructive.  But really, that's just nitpicking -- this is a fine book, and certainly a must for folks drawn in by the whole &quot;No Depression&quot; scene.  Recommended!	2001-08-10

AMG's voluminous electronic music directory is cogent and exhaustive, sure to be a delight for the style's fans and non-fans alike.  Fans will love this book for its thoroughness, its uber-cool, authoritative air and for its immense lack of humor, all of which seem reflective of the scene(s) it seeks to document.  Non-fans will be delighted by the intensive devotion to ephemera and the belligerently academic tone which seeks to browbeat outsiders into accepting the worldview of a musical movement that hails each club opening as the birth of a new subgenre.  Hundreds of artists and dozens of styles are outlined and their histories detailed with absolute, messianic precision.  While AMG's level of writing is superior to most of its contemporaries, the tone is no less smug or evangelical; the sense of being intellectually bludgeoned will seem familiar to those of us who have watched the rise of electronica with wry but aggrieved detatchment.  (Yes, I'm sure you love the stuff, but do you have to devote so much energy to coercing the rest of us into adopting your point of view?)  All kidding aside, this book will be a definitive resource for years to come.  Anyone interested in understanding the growth and self-perceptions of the electronic music cult will find this book invaluable.	2001-08-10

Hilmes is both a fan of the medium and a critic of its development, paying special attention to radio's role in shaping American national identity.  The presentation of women and various ethnic groups is one of her main concerns, but Hilmes isn't a mere PC grind; she also explores the nuances of supposed stereotypes, analyzing the degree to which these characterizations both shaped and reflected the world around them.  It's fascinating to read an account of a seemingly &quot;dead&quot; medium... She does a great job capturing the flavor of the times, even though most of us will never be able to hear the shows she mentions.  Hilmes draws upon several major media libraries, as well as extensive governmental and academic archives, mixing bureaucratic, sociological and pop cultural perspectives.  Of particular interest to readers in the present day, where multinational conglomerates duke it out over the vanishing frontier of post-dotcom economy, and the FCC and Congress have sharply curtailed freedom of expression (under the guise of protecting intellectual property), is the older, earlier story of how the US government and the budding broadcast industry squelched the amatuer broadcasters of the 'teens and '20s.  In some ways it's a side note to Himes' wider social concerns, but it couldn't be more timely.  Recommended reading!	2001-08-10

Nothing says &quot;big business&quot; like a good lawsuit or two... and here's a book that's full of them.  Whether it's Billy Joel suing his brother-in-law (who was also his business manager), the Shirelles suing George Harrison, the Beatles suing each other, or some hick parents suing Judas Priest for &quot;causing&quot; their kids to commit suicide (even though they came from physically violent homes), it's all fun and games in the rock and roll courtroom.  Most of these are fairly well-known cases, but Soocher's light-handed style lends itself to a quick read.  He doesn't get hung up on minutae, and keeps the narrative down to a minimum (although conversely, he also has a genteel streak wherein he sometimes alludes to lurid incidents without fully explaining them, which can get irksome...) Censorship comes up in a few of these cases, but mostly it's all about money, money, money, with a little concern for intellectual property thrown in for good measure.  Oddly enough, I found George Michael's lawsuit against Sony to be one of the more interesting chapters in this book -- maybe just because it was one of the least familiar cases.  At any rate, if you want to keep your illusions about showbiz intact, you might wanna veer away from this one.  If, on the other hand, you're curious about what makes a multi-million dollar contract tick, then snap it up.	2001-08-10

Escott has made a career out of telling outrageous, sometimes salacious, tales -- he gets to the rawer, visceral side of the story pretty quickly, which is relatively easy when you're talking to folks who worked in the scraggly, scruffy early years of country, rock and blues.  He's an engaging, consersational  writer, and this latest collection is a delight. Includes essays on artists such as Dale Hawkins, Don Everly, Johnny Horton, Tim Hardin and a particularly cruel skewering of Pat Boone.  In one of the most fascinating sections, Escott profiles the founders of record labels such as Decca, King, Starday and Hi -- a fascinating and very illuminating appoach to presenting the history of popular music.  Beautifully laid out, well written and highly recommended.	2001-08-10
