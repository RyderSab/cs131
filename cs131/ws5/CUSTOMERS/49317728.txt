I think Levin has performed a great service to the country with this work. I found his writing to be interesting and lively and I found his topic to be very important for our times. I do believe that for the most part he was simply reiterating the things that an avid follower of the news would already be familiar with. On the other hand he brings out a lot of the history of the court which I think is important and interesting especially for those who don't normally follow the court.<br /><br />I think his pointing out the human failings of the members of the court is highly significant given the life tenure of the judges. I also think it is of very great interest. Suppose, as Levin details, a member is incapacitated mentally. How do we deal with that issue ? Surely the answer is not an impeachment. But neither should we have cases of national importance be decided by Alzheimer's patients.<br /><br />Another extraordinarily interesting tidbit I gathered from the book was the decision (or was it a dissent) that stated that the court should serve as an unbiased decision maker between the US Government and terrorists dedicated to the destruction of the US. UNBIASED ? If the court is unbiased in reference to the USA and her avowed enemies how can we think of it as an American court? What implications arise if our highest court has loyalties to other than the interests of American citizens?<br /><br />Whatever your outlook I recommend the book. If you are a fan of what can be called leftist decisions of the court you will seethe as you read the book but it will inform you as to what right wing nutjobs like me are thinking.  If you are a right wing thinker like me you will find the book very interesting.	2005-08-25

I think much of the history was indeed accurate. Where I part ways with Mr. Buchanan is in the lessons that he draws and his conclusions. The problem is with Mr. Buchanan's assessment of what should be learned from the America First movement (and other events chronicled in this work) not his recitation of the history. What most of us learned from the history of WWII is that the cost of stopping Hitler was much, much higher than it would have been had we and/or our allies acted more aggressively. Most of the interested citizens have not found the America First movement as vile etc merely wrong on a great scale.<br /><br />I also think that given Mr. Buchanan's repeated mention of the warnings to avoid foreign conflicts he should spend more time dealing with the technological issues that effect that outlook. The Monroe doctrine was established because having the European powers in our \\"neck of the woods\\" would have important foreign policy implications. Given the relative transportation technologies Baghdad is a lot closer to Washington than Birmingham was in Washington's day.  That closeness and the associated danger is precisely the lesson that we learned as a result of WWII.<br /><br />If the topic of foreign policy is of interest to you this book will be an interesting read. Even though I disagree with much of the conclusions I found this work time well spent reading.	2005-08-18

I thought the authors did a very good job of making their point that Christianity has much forgiveness to seek. I think as far as that goes, tis true.<br /><br />But, I think many of the assertions are a bit of a stretch, for example the assertion that Pope Urban's call was a call for unprovoked aggression. Even the quotes the authors' use indicates that the Pope was trying to take the Holy Land BACK. Also, while I think the argument can be made that there were definite political advantages in Europe that The Crusades provided. However, I think it is a far harder argument to make that The Crusades were launched solely or even primarily for domestic political reasons. I think the authors fall a little short in both cases.<br /><br />Also, I think the author's condemnation of Richard the Lion hearted is weak. While there is reason for modern Christiandom to not be proud of his treatment of the conquered, it must also be dealt within the time and the culture. According to the authors'; own account RTLH accepted the surrender of  the city based upon conditions that the inhabitants knew they could not fulfill. RTLH by the standards of the day, merely lived up to his promise. From his point of view it may very well be that even though the locals dealt with him dishonestly and still kept the true Cross of Christ hidden he, in his generosity did not harm the women and children. In our time by our standards that would be absurd but in the day killing the men of a town or village that did not meet your demands is not all that uncommon.<br /><br />Even with the faults that this work has it is an excellent read. I think for the most part the authors' try and succeed in showing the warts of Chistiandom in a respectful manner. The work has the feel of being an internal and kind criticism. Which comes as no surprise since that was the expressed intent of the authors.	2005-07-25

I am not sure how this book will do when I start writing ASP.Net but it reads pretty well. I would have preferred a more concise work but I thought the writing was well done.<br /><br />I liked that the code was done in both C# and VB.I thought that it allowed the reader moving from ASP to see what (if any) advantages there might be to switching to C# as well as providing the reader with a level of difficulty for C# etc.<br /><br />I also would have preferred if the code samples on the download link would have been in a Visual Studio project.<br /><br />All of that being said, I think the writing was very well done and plenty of examples. I love examples.<br /><br />I would recommend the book to a programmer wanting to learn about ASP.NET.	2005-06-02

Definite Read	I really liked the work. Let me state at the beginning I agreed with the premise before I read the book. So many of the arguments in the book were points of view I shared. But they were points of view from people educated in fields that I know little or nothing about. It is hard not to enjoy a book that argues in your favor.<br /><br />All of that being said I think many of the arguments are highly reasonable and convincing. Some of the arguments are common sense a bit more structured and others are more advanced. I like his approach of conducting interviews with leading scientists, though I could have skipped over the listing of degrees and publications. I think the most convincing arguments are those from biology. The discussions of the cell, DNA and bio-chemistry are extraordinarily good arguments.<br /><br />I would criticize the author in that in one of the early chapters of the book Hawkings' imaginary numbers are criticized on the very basis that Hawkings deals with in \\"A Brief History of Time\\". No mention of Hawkins' defense is made. I think the lack of comment is sloppy work. I think it reflects poorly on the author and the editor. I think imaginary numbers can be argued against but to simply ignore the answer Hawkins gave makes a criticism of them in this work seem weak. Furthermore, I am forced to wonder what other weaknesses are in the work that I am not well read enough to see. The book overcomes this flaw but it is a serious one.<br /><br />All in all I think it is a good work and I think the point is validly made. Again though I am a person who thinks a drawing on a cave wall proves man existed when the drawing was made. I think this because the drawing is too purposefully complex to be the accidental splashing of liquids caused by a gaseous cave. Of course I think the man is slightly more purposefully complex than the drawing and that must prove something too. Regardless of whether you agree with that or not, if you find the topic interesting you should find the book interesting.ng you should find the book interesting.	2005-05-16

Of course Nicholi selects those writings that he thinks are to the point but I think he does a wonderful job.<br /><br />The book is very interesting and balanced.

Williams has done a good job of providing the reader insight into a leading thinker in our time. As with most leaders there are those who think he is a genius, those who think he is a fool and those who think he is evil. The choice is of course dependent upon how closely the leader agrees with the observer.<br /><br />\\"Free as In Freedom\\" paints what seems to be an accurate if not overly flattering portrait of RMS. He comes off as a brilliant but deeply wounded and vicious person. RMS describes those who disagree with his philosophy as engaging in evil. Not in doing something he believes is evil. The great contribution he made began as a temper tantrum as a result of people being hired away from the MIT AI Lab and Stallman not having access to tools that had been paid for and provided to him previously. One of the most remarkable facets about Stallman is that his temper has benefited so many people. Most of us just throw the &^%##@ driver in the *&^%##@ lake !<br /><br />Stallman is a major contributor in our time and this is an excellent book. If you are interested in the Free Software/Open Source movement this is a must read.	2005-03-28

Books	5	4	4	N	N	A Great Work	Forrest, though contreversial was without a doubt one of the best generals on either side in the Civil War. He was able to do more with less than many others in similar situations. With no education and being looked down upon by most of his peirs that is an especially impressive achievement.<br /><br />Henry's work is also good in that it allows us to contrast biographies todaywith the ones from previous times. Henry pays little attention to Foresst's role in the Klan and portrays his slave trading and slave holding in the most positive light possible (dim though that may be). A more modern biographer might well blaze a blinding light upon these activities to the exclusion  of his battlefield achievements.<br /><br />I would recomend this work to the reader interested in the Civil War. It does not cover much else in the life of Forrest. It is well written and a good read.	2004-12-03

Raymond does a very good job of explaining the pros of the open source model. His work is a little weak in explaining the other side. In the essay \\"The Magic Cauldron\\" He asks what are the payoffs ? He does only a moderate job of portraying the strengths of the closed source approach.<br /><br />Having read \\"The hiistory of the Internet\\" several times I thought that the chapter \\"A breif History of Hackerdo\\" would be a yawn fest but it was very interesting. I would still disagree with many of the conclusions Raymond draws, especially about the economics and business case of open source but I found his analyisis of the motivations of hackers very interesting. In all I liked the work very much.<br /><br />The work is very well written and well thought out. It gives the strengths of the open source approach very well. It also gives a lot of insights into \\"Hackerdom\\" and \\"Hackers\\"<br /><br />If you are interested in a book on Open SOurce This is a very good read.	2004-11-30

Many of the situations and timelines etc don't really match. I did not find that too distracting. Afterall, the story is about some cocain bandits taking over a country and the little boy who watches them kill his parents grows up to be a secret agent. A little thing like time lines being out of whack does not seem to hard to accept.<br /><br />The writing is fast paced and the illusions are just plain fun.

Bell is getting better tying things together and not creating the odd timeline problem.<br /><br />Assassin is a lot of fun to read and is fast paced. The language is a neat feature in that as the plot follows a particular character the language of the novel is in the dialect of the character.

Of course it does not hold the same facination today as it would in 1872. Nonetheless it is a great work and a lot of fun to read.<br /><br />One thing that I found very interesting is that many of the things that we take for granted today required explaining in 1872. For example, the author felt it was important to describe to his readers what a banna was like. What author would need to do that today ? Of course mu8ch of the style etc etc is very differnet than today's. But the writing is similar enough that the book is an easy read.<br /><br />I am not sure if I would grant this status as a classic but I would definitly recommend the book. I would especially recommend the book to younger readers.	2004-09-18

From the very early part of the century when the ancient ways were dying a painful and horrible death. Through the turmoil of the middle century. Right up to the later part of the last century.<br /><br />The book shows the warts of the pro-American forces and even to a certian degree of the communists. It is really interesting to read about the cult of Mao now and remember when the litte red book was so popular over here. The author keeps the reader spell bound with the gripping tales of the hardships and achievements that her family encountered. Much of it seems so very strange to me having lived a life so far removed (Thank God) from the kind of harships her family faced.<br /><br />The book is a great read and it does a really good job of putting a human face on China. I would not suggest this for a history of China but it is an excellent way of getting a hint at what the historical events of the last century were like for the people of China. I would highly recomend this book. It has given me a great interest in China.	2004-09-17

I do think that it is being drawn out further than I would prefer. But I enjoy each of these books very much.<br />Like the others, this book is a good example of what the authors view as the ideal. It is also a way to see how the author interoperates the Bible especially the apocalypse. The authors are very talented in writing action fiction. The work goes very fast and is an easy read.<br />This is not a good book for a serious debate about the book of Revelation. The book takes a particular interpretation of that book of the bible and tells a fictional story based upon a portion of the teachings of the Bible as they are understood by the authors.<br />I highly enjoy the series and recommend it to anyone.	2004-05-15

What I think is very important about this book is that it will have people who do not normally think in a structured manner doing so about their religion and their relationship with their savior. That is excellent.<br />What I did not like was that with each turn of the page the reader expects Warren to recount how he was fed by the ravens or his calling down fire from heaven to consume the preists of Baal. In one of the first pages Warren writes that God intended for me to read the book. The arrongance makes the book rather difficult to read. Also I would suggest reading with a Bible handy. Many of the Bible quotations are partial and the different translations may make them at the very least seem to be out of context.<br />But all in all I think this is a book worth the effort. Especially since it has had such an impact. If you do not normally think about why you live your life the way you do and you are a Christian I highly recommend the book.	2004-04-20

I thought the style was very readable and the of course the subject matter was very interesting.<br />The other reviewers of this work dislike the fact that Hirshson blames Patton's speeches for the atrocities in Italy. Agreed the assertion is silly but it is clearly opinion. The author also clearly thinks that the general was too dismissive of academcs and reporters etc.<br />All in all I think it is well worth the read. As with any work this ones shows the reader much about the author in addition to the subject. I learned much about WWII and WWI. I found the Tank/Calvary intellectual battle that went on throughout Patton's career very interesting.<br />I would recomend the book. I would also note that the author is not a &quot;Blood and Guts&quot; kinda guy.	2004-02-27

I thought it recorded an important aspect of political life in today's America.<br />I do agree that the title is a little misleading. Persecution is not really what is going on in America today vis a vie Christians. However, discrimination is. That is what is chronicled in the book. I also would like to have seen more fleshing out and description of a position posited rather than the annecdotes that make up the vast majority of the book. Of course these are very important to gather because without the great number that we see in the book we would tend to overlook the breadth of the problem.<br />I really enjoyed the chapter on America's Christian heritage and founding. I think that the fallacy of a bunch of agnostic leaning deists needs to be debunked. I would like to have seen more of that. Especially in the lives of the founders.<br />I would recomend this work to anyone interested in the subject of Religious liberty. No matter which side of the issue you are on.	2004-01-02

First the style interests me. Second the positive and negative characteristics are sharply different. For example many of the signers are stated to have been good examples of piety. I am forced to wonder what a modern writer would have to say in such regard.<br />The topic of this work was also of great interest. One thing that struck me was the familiarity of the names. Counties streets, schools all sorts of things have very similar names. Also the amount that these men gave for all of us to enjoy what we do today is astounding.

Still, when they do finally complete the series I am going to start at one and read them all over again.<br />One thing that I think the series does exceptionally well is to describe the ideal for the non-believer. One problem with that may be so few of us believers approximate the ideals in the series that non-believers will not recognize the ideals as relating to Christians they have known. With that caution I would especially recommend this series to the non-believer, for a great number of reasons.<br />All in all I would recomend this book to anyone who finds the topic of interest.	2003-04-26

Almost every single occurrence of the man's name is accompanied by some mention of his girth. One might expect a similar treatment of Hitler. The mad dwarf, the crazy diminutive, the nutty midget etc etc. Although Shirer does mention the fact that Hitler was a WWI corporal over and over as if that should be some sort of insult.<br />At any rate, the book was wonderful. Much detail but at the same time very engrossing and interesting. The majority of the book deals with the rise to power as opposed to the fall. I would not recommend this work to anyone interested in a military history of the Nazis in WWII. This is a political history. It tells who how when and where the party came to power and it deals with the governing of the party more than the military aspects. Which is why this book is of such interest many man books have been written about the military aspects. Similarly the holocaust is also dealt with rather quickly though not glossed over.<br />All in all I would suggest this book to anyone who would like a political history of the Nazi government. Just be warned if you are interested in a  history of WWII the 1130(+-) of this book won't quite be enough.	2003-04-12

I was skeptical from the start. I think it has some valid points but I beleive that a full book on four or five lines in &quot;one of the least read sections&quot; of the Bible can't help but add to the scripture.<br />I would recomend the book to Christians and those who would like to see how a certian segment of the Christian religion thinks.	2003-03-25

Fromkin has done an excellent job researching his topic and he does an even better job of writing. The book is very interesting and well written. I would recommend it to anyone interested in reading on the topic of The Middle East.<br />On the other hand, as the title implies Fromkin tells us that the problem today in the Middle East is based in the West nearly a hundred years ago. He details very well the inept and often corrupt dealings of the colonial powers but he stops there. The problems with the clan fighting etc did not start in the early 20th century nor are they solely to blame by the \\"Peace to End All Peace\\".<br />The book is well researched and written better. I recommend it to anyone interested in Middle Easter Affairs especially those who tend to agree with the assumption indicated in the title.	2003-03-25

I learned a great deal from this work.<br />I had no idea of how well connected young Churchill was nor how well he had used those connections. Also I have long been an admirer of WSC because of his strong stance in WWII and his anti communism. I did not have any idea as to how liberal (in the modern sense) he was in other ways. I knew that he had served in combat but knew no details. I also learned a great deal about the up and downs and ins and outs of his political career.<br />Churchill was an extraordinary man and Gilbert does a good job of cataloging the triumphs, defeats and the setbacks. What I would have liked to see more of was the witticisms and \\"great moments\\". WSC is attributed with many interesting quips and stories. I would have enjoyed a biography that dealt with more of these.<br />I found the chapters on the interwar years of particular interest in light of current events. I would recommend the book to anyone considering a biography of Churchill.	2002-12-18

But, I did not find the dramatically moving passages that were common in the other Uris books I had read. I am sure a big part of that had to do with the subject matter.<br />I would suggest this book to anyone but especially to those who do not remember the Cold War.	2002-12-18

This work gives me the opportunity to read the transcripts of some of them.<br />President Roosevelts speeches are of a great deal of interest in the current political environment. While I disagree with a lot of the premises he based his beliefs upon he was indeed a great American President. Had he not possessed the courage to force the increase in armaments production where would we have been once we were dragged into the war ?<br />One also gets to see the corner stone of many of today's programs being built. His arguments that times have changed and political liberty is not enough to ensure the liberty of the common man is at the heart of many arguments of today.<br />Regardless of your political outlook, if you are a history buff you should love this book. You may also wear a highlighter a little thin as I did.	2002-10-01

I spent the better part of this year reading this book. But the beauty is that does not pose a problem because the writings included in this work are all relatively short. Make no mistake this is a very long work but well worth the effort. Especially since it is a collection of an incredible number of very short works.<br />The collected works are as the title states contemporary accounts. It is a real treat to read what the contenders had to say about each other. Also the reader may think that the style will be difficult. Not at all.<br />All in all I would most heartily recommend this work for either the student who would like a resource or anyone interested in The Revolution.	2002-09-25

It does not disappoint. The author simply explains what he believes is common among Christian beliefs. I find no argument with him there.<br />I also found the dated nature of some of his examples quite interesting. The most memorable example or analogy Lewis uses is to explain what he means by Go being &quot;outside of time&quot;. I had heard of this before and the more I think of it the more sense it makes to me.<br />I recommend this book to anyone. Lewis does not preach he simply states this is what is believed and why. Take it or leave it. Of course part of the why is what the consequences of not accepting are but he portrays this in a very straight forward manner.	2001-12-30

I must have missed something.<br />I thought the play was entertaining in a dark, depressing manner. But the message of hopelessness that I got from the work was just pitiful. The only characters to be admired in the play were weak victims. The strong are happy and the good are fools. I suppose many that love the work feel a sense of helplessness and hopelessness and find a sort of validation in it.<br />I would not recommend this book for its message but for entertainment there are worse reads out there.	2001-12-30

I also wonder what they are going to do when they read the last verse of Revelation. Of course I suppose it is possible that they have read it and are convinced that there is no POSSIBLE way they could be adding or taking away. Either way, the books are great entertainment and entertainment that does not degrade is wonderfully refreshing today.<br />I am also a little disappointed that the authors are breaking it up into so many books. If they simply cannot condense it into fewer pages I wish they would write fewer and longer books.<br />If you are looking to find great, complex, deep literature buy something else. These books are great and this is another in a great series but they are not Pulitzer contenders, nor does it appear they were meant to be. Ever notice how the Back to the Future movies were fairly simplistic and predictable but a lot of fun to watch?  I recommend the series and this installment.<br />One thing that I think the series does exceptionally well is to describe the ideal for the non-believer. One problem with that may be so few of us believers approximate the ideals in the series that non-believers will not recognize the ideals as relating to Christians they have known. With that caution I would especially recommend this series to the non-believer, for a great number of reasons.	2001-11-27

I was working on a problem a couple of years ago and took the suggestion of a co-worker to buy this book. For the last two years I have been using it as a reference. I spent a few months off and came back and embaressed myself puting a report in process scheduler. So I sat down and read the book front to back. I wish I had done this a couple of years ago.<br />I have been working with SQR for five years. I have used examples and the SQR manuals to accomplish what I wanted. This work provided me with a lot of knowledge that I had never taken the time to pick up. Now even if I take the time off and need a refresher the sections are highlighted.<br />I have found this book very useful as both a reference and a knoweldge builder. Also, the writing style was good enough that rereading the portions that I was alread aware of was not too irksome. Interestingly, I could swear some of the interview questions I have been asked came right out of this book.	2001-11-02

I disagree with the political statement but the description of the thought process that Clancey uses is remarkable. I think that he shows a great deal of understanding of the thought process that other people use. The level that he is able to accomplish this is remarkable .<br />The story though far fetched is excellent. Of course the idea that somebody would drive an airliner into a building was bit far fetched not so very long ago. The technical detail that he describes the weapons with is wonderful. It is interesting to hear about the same weapons on the news every night.<br />I did not find this story as spellbinding as some of the other works I have read by Clancy but it is still a better book to buy than most of the entertainment books out there.<br />I wrote the above before I read the other reviews. I would caution the potential first time buyer if all you get out of this is an American, Russia, Chinese comparison you ain't paying attention. The nationalities aren't representative of races as much as they are thought processes. And they are foils more than reality. This book is not about America versus them. It is a very, VERY detailed pro-life statment. Either that or I totally missed it.	2001-10-29

The author has an excellent ability to report as he shows in the majority of the book but in his final chapter he observes the obvious and concludes the ridiculous.<br />The first portion of the book describes the training a recruit receives or rather the training a particular platoon received. I enjoyed this work a great deal. As a former Marine who spent a summer at PI it brought back a lot of memories.  I had the honor to meet General Al Gray when I returned from a cruise off the coast of Lebanon.  The warrior mentality he (and Webb) brought back to the Corps described in this book was long overdue.<br />The method of following the platoon and describing the actions of both the DI and the recruit is a fine device. It provided me with an insight into the other side of boot camp that I would not have. The description of boot camp seems excellent. A great deal has changed in the last twenty years as the author clearly describes.<br />The last chapter of the book moves from a descriptive mode of what occurred to a speculative mode of why the split between the military and the greater society is increasing. The author spends a great deal of the chapter bemoaning the political activity of the military. The military is described as conservative and the media as &quot;antiauthoritarian&quot;. We are then treated with a discussion of how while the military has always been conservative it is to be feared that they are now (gasp!) voting. The entire discussion is of how the split is growing and the actions of the military. No discussion at all is offered of how the media or other &quot;antiauthoritarian&quot; elitist groups are moving. To mention over and over the clear distinctions of right and wrong on PI and then wonder why the alumni by and large actively oppose  a party led by a man who famously debates the meaning of  the word &quot;is&quot; to say the least is ironic.<br />All in all this is an excellent book and well worth reading. Especially for former or current Marines.excellent book and well worth reading. Especially for former or current Marines.	2001-10-29

The amount of difficulty he faced throughout his life is unimaginable to modern man. Washington had a life of privilege which is the main reason he was placed in a position of responsibility so early in life. However, in all of his campaigns he was dealing with shortages, sicknesses and other difficulties that make our own seem not so difficult.<br />Reading this work will provide the reader with an understanding how lucky America was to have a man of such temperament at her founding. Washington was a man of great intellect. He proved that by defeating the British on a number of occasions. He was a man of high honor which he proved when the various cabals tried to remove him from his office and he answered them with excellent performance and an absence of the acrimony so many would have used. He was a man of incomprehendable determination. The crossing of the Deleware, the winter at Valley forge and hundreds of other examples prove this. He was a man of tremendous resourcefulness as is shown by his ability to field an army when provisions were always in want for many years and at the same time attend to so many other details.<br />Washington Irving's work will provide the reader with an excellent understanding of all of these qualities. I recommend this book to anyone interested in Washington's life. The vast majority of this work deals with the revolution so if you are interested in the early years or the later years you will not find a great deal of detail in this particular work.	2001-10-29

Later when I entered in the chapters on marketing I was thrilled with an entry level book.<br />I needed (and still need) good ideas to help me market my business. I used my highlighter a great deal in this book. In almost every one of the later chapters I found really good ideas. Also the structure of the book was wonderful. The beginning of every chapter is a series of descriptive or narrative paragraphs, case study, resources and a cheat sheet. The structure that Kinnard uses makes this a tool for reference as well as a good read.<br />Finally, I think Kinnard has an excellent style. I think one of the great tasks of writing a book like this one is that most of the audience really is not interested in reading the material. We just want to know it so that we can use it. So, time spent reading and learning about email is tiresome. Kinnard does a good job of making the paint dry quickly.	2001-08-20

I knew a fair amount about the first voyage of Columbus from the perspective of the political and the historical but very little about the voyage itself or the man Columbus. The Admiral of the Ocean Sea is an excellent source for information on all of the voyages themselves as well as the general information from a historical point of view.<br />Morison does an excellent job of describing the man Columbus. While many people in our own century will have a very difficult time seeing him as a man of morals due to the manner in which treated non-European people, Morison shows us a picture of a man consumed with the understanding of morality in his day. The lengths that Columbus went to attain piety are rarely taught or written of today and I found the sections dealing with these very informative.<br />I also found the description of the sailing vessels and of the conditions of the sailors to be quite interesting. The majority of the material dealing with sailing itself (a good part of the book) I lacked sufficient understanding to really enjoy. I know little of navigation and little of astronomy so celestial observations are bit beyond me. However I was able to understand in general terms the result (ie Columbus was off a lot or a little)<br />While I had learned a great deal about the dealing of later explorers with the Indians I knew little of the first explorers relations with them. Naturally what I learned about the Spaniards did not surprise me. What did surprise me was how many times traveling along the various coasts the Spaniards met with hostile locals. True most of the Indians were friendly to their own detriment but some did indeed show a little fight.<br />Also The Admiral of the Ocean Sea does a really good job of placing the events of the discovery of America into their proper context. The Spanish inquisition was in full swing. The Crusades were a part of recent history and the intermingling of European royal blood for political purposes was at its height.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone interested in a balanced biography of Columbus.

Especially, since Dolly the sheep came into being. Now, I wonder how many of the people that referenced this book in the cloning debate actually read it or at least read it recently.<br />The book was great ! The point of the book was against the social conditioning that we see all around us and the orthodoxy of the dominate \\"intellectuals\\". Clones are used to show us that by allowing ourselves to be conditioned rather than thinking about ourselves and our society we lack any sort of individuality or freedom.<br />I found the appeal to morality and God to be especially refreshing. The idea that the view of God as not being required being a folly of youth is something not heard often enough.<br />Using this book as a reference against scientific research (cloning or any other) is particularly ironic given the following passage :<br />\\"But once you began admitting explanations in terms of purpose - well, you didn't know what the result might be. It was the sort of idea that might easily decondition the more unsettled minds among the higher castes-make they loose their faith in happiness as the Sovereign Good and take to believing, instead, that the goal was somewhere outside the present human sphere; that the purpose of life was not the maintenance of well-being, but some enlargement of knowledge. Which was, the Controller reflected, quite possibly true. But not, in the present circumstance, admissible. He picked up his pen again, and under the words \\"Not to be Published\\" drew a second line, thicker and blacker than the first; then sighed, \\"What fun it would be, \\" he thought, \\"if one didn't have to think about happiness!\\"<br />Personally, I think the message of the book warns against political correctness or blind faith  in any orthodoxy (religious or otherwise) not cloning. What is bleak and frightening in this book is not that the faces of the characters look alike but that their minds work the same. Mental homogeneity is as frightening a prospect if it comes from TV, movies or other sources of propaganda as if it comes from a test tube..

I am not a big fan of the horror genre but I did like this work. However like many of the peices of its time it took a great deal of time and effort building the scenes and the characters. In this case I thought as soon as all of the build up was complete the book came to a close too quickly.<br />On the other hand, the social commentary was very interesting.

The essays are fairly well balanced although there are more that are opposed than in favor. But, there are probably more people opposed to human cloning than are in favor. At any rate this is an excellent book.<br />There are several really good layman's descriptions of exactly what the biological results of cloning are. Big surprise, it is not what the media have led us to believe. On the other hand knowing the exact results does not seem to change the preponderance of opinion one way or the other.<br />One of the best essays in the book for describing the science was written by Phillip Kitcher, although I think the conclusions he reached were totally off base. He wrote \\"Reality is much more sobering, and it is a good idea to preface debates about the morality of human cloning with a clear understanding of the scientific facts\\"  To many of us forced our ideas about cloning before we knew the facts.<br />Perhaps the whole debate was summed up in a single sentence written by Jonathan R. Cohen n his essay \\"Cloning in Jewish Thought\\". &quot;Ultimately, cloning challenges us to consider how important our genetic structure is to our sense of self.\\"<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the ethical debate surrounding cloning.	2001-05-08

Unfortunately, for him, things did not turn out as he had predicted. The economic postulates of this book are quite obviously, flawed. The United States was not bought by Japan. If they were indeed fighting a war with us the &quot;bomb&quot; we hit them with was the dot.bomb. Of course that had nothing to do with the ten year decline that they have been experiencing. One wonders who will be to blame for the next round of economic malaise.<br />As far as the story itself goes, it is well written and interesting.

Moore uses real world examples and effectively makes his case in the examples very well. Where this book is weak is with Moore's assertions  broadening the model from his examples to the market. For instance, suppose the business cycle described in this book applies to an example with Intel. In order to make the point that the model also applies to other tech or even online businesses one needs sound logic to relate those businesses to Intel. Moore does not always make his case for broader application very well. Sometimes the case seems to fit very well and others it does not.<br />The modeling was very good and most of the points of the book were excellently made and very well thought out. I would recommend this book to anyone in the tech field.	2001-03-12

You're right. Feynman uses easy to understand examples and relates them very well to his subject matter.<br /> After I saw the 10 year anniversary edition to &quot;A Breif History of Time&quot; I felt guilty and I read my 10 year old copy. I should have read this book first. I would have been much better prepared to read the other. Both books were great but Feynman did a better job of relating the scientific to the mundane.	2001-02-27

At best he is donotbethisman. Perhaps that is why he is named Low Man. His life is much like the scenes with young Biff when he is being asked about the behavior. He has an attitude of &quot;What can I do ? I don't have to be any more than popular.&quot;<br />Willy, has not pursued the basis for relationships. He has not built his relationships with customers and his friends and his employers through trust and integrity. Are we to believe that the first lie he told the young boss that he trained was the volume he did in the year 1929 ? I don't think so. Willy teaches Biff that it does not matter if he works at studying but just that he is well liked. Who in the end is well liked the frivolous or the industrious ? Not just who is materially successful but who is respected and cared for ?<br />His family has followed his lead. His wife is right Willy is a leader. Biff he teaches to be a thief and Happy a womanizer. Why does the dinner with his sons fail ? Because Biff can't get a job because he is a thief and Happy won't stay away from the women long enough to perform familial duty. Traits they learned from their father.<br />This play is wonderfully written. The moral of the tale is about oppression, that of weak resolution. Not only an interesting story but a great moral tale. No wonder I was supposed to read it in high school. Sadly, for me, Biff and I were out playing ball at the construction site.	2001-02-15

Not so much in and of itself but because of the flowing reviews of those who respect the individual and the venom of those who do not. When I see reviews that compare a libertarian author to fascists I can usually expect an extremely good read.<br />Most Hayek's arguments are sound and valid. The book is excellent but I did not find it as earth shaking as I expected due to the reviews.	2001-02-14

I have read a bit of history about the revolutionary period but all of my reading has been to do with the occurrences on this side of the water. Brands' details not only the life of Franklin but the events surrounding it. The result is a book that provides a great deal of information on a variety of topics.<br />If there has been one American life that exemplifies the ideal it must be Benjamin Franklin's. A few years ago doing well by doing good was a popularly stated goal. That very well could have been a description of Franklin's life. Although, I imagine he would have thought &quot;good&quot; included a bit more than his civic contributions. The abstemious, industrious and frugal nature of the young Franklin described in this book should be taught more frequently.<br />Brands style is also lively enough to keep the reader interested. Often historical accounts of even the most remarkable lives can be rather a chore to read. Not so with this book. I recommend it; personally, I think, I will be reading a biography of Mr T. Roosevelt soon.	2001-02-13
