US	52084271	R2RCZDJ4QGTPYZ	0345452488	152173173	Time's Eye (A Time Odyssey, Book 1)	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Where ignorant empires clash by night	This is the first book in a projected \\"Time Odyssey\\" series to parallel Clarke's \\"Space Odyssey\\". There are points of similarity (Pre-human ape men. Cosmic sweep. Alien artifacts  - monoliths there, and a planetwide grid of hovering extradimensional spheres here - powerful in their effects, and still more powerful in their ability to make the mind slide off their surfaces while scrabbling for a mental handhold.)     And there are points of difference. Here, all voyaging is in time, as those spheres transplant our protagonists onto an earth whose surface is a jaggedly sewn patchwork of many ages, from a million BC to the 2030s. And here, a passel of sequels is in view from the beginning, so that the authors felt no pressure to bring the first volume to a rounded conclusion. Would be time voyagers, beware: here there be cliffhangers.    Since \\"Childood's End\\", one of Clarke's constant concerns has been the broad arc of human development, from prehistory to the present to future destiny. In this series, that arc will be front and center again. In this first book, it manifests particularly as a meditation on empires: their value, their cruelty, their variety and their common features.     Accordingly, most of the action concerns the British Raj, Alexander the Great's eastern campaign, Genghis Khan's golden horde, and the agents of a shakily militarized future UN, as they meet on the plains of parley and battle. The strictly science fictional aspects of the tale are given short shrift, postponed to other installments, and the resulting flavor is less one of SF than of alternate history, from a less obsessively detailed and more readable Harry Turtledove.    It's certainly well-paced, engaging, and occasionally stimulating. Whether it turns out to be worth 4 stars rather than the 3 1/2 I've assigned will depend on how well its science-fictional promise is kept in succeeding episodes. Given the known capacity of both collaborators, the auspices are pretty good.	2005-03-28

Wherever there's a scheme to skip out on taxes due, Johnston, who has covered the tax beat for the New York Times since 1995, can cite you chapter and verse. <br /> <br />The catch? None of them work unless you are worth millions to begin with. <br /> <br />There are a number of reasons for this. The biggest is, that Congress requires wages and proceeds from interest bearing accounts - the only forms of income available to the poor and the middle class - to be reported to the IRS by employers and financial institutions. This makes your taxes easy to audit, and your income hard to hide. Most of the income of what Johnston dubs \\"the political donor class\\" is invisible to the IRS, unless and until someone chooses to place it on a tax form. Fewer and fewer of the very wealthy bother to make that choice; and Johnston details the decisions made by Congress over the last twenty years that have steadily reduced the risks of cheating: making the IRS easier to sue (if you have the money to threaten suits), reducing the number of auditors; explicitly requiring the auditors to spend most of their manpower chasing after the returns of the working poor. <br /> <br />But there are also plenty of legal dodges. In some cases, these started out as sensible policy, and just never got fixed once rich evaders found loopholes in them - like the legally \\"small\\" and therefore tax-free insurance companies that launder billions and don't write policies (see chapter 13). In others, the whole point of the laws was to make sure taxes are shifted from the upper middle class to the rich - such as the many ways the rich, and only the rich, can defer taxes year after year, while the Social Security \\"fix\\" of 1993 had ordinary Americans paying hundreds of billions of taxes decades in advance. (Since a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow, these aren't just deferrals and prepayments: they're tax reductions for the wealthy and tax increases for the rest of us.) <br /> <br />Whether it's the Alternative Minimum Tax, which is poised, over the next decade, to take away all of the Bush tax cuts that went to the middle and upper middle class, while leaving the cuts for the wealthy intact; or the way interlocking partnerships can shift hundreds of millions of taxes from corporations onto breadwinners each year, or exactly how Enron was able to - and other companies still do - report zero profits to the IRS while reporting billions of profits to shareholders, using bogus overseas subsidiaries; - this book is a guide, a prod, and a long term reference, from an expert who knows where all the bodies are buried, and how your wallet got into the corpse's pockets. <br /> <br />The indignation flows free through these pages, with ample justification. But for every gram of indignation, there's a kilo of pure uncut information. I learned an enormous amount from Johnston about how our system really works, even though I already had more than a suspicion as to whom it really works for. Get a copy, read it, take notes, and pass it on to your neighbors.	2005-03-18
US	52084271	R3D7BZZ5JNZ8U5	0679454438	148918425	The Road to Reality : A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe	Books	5	67	77	N	N	A paradise for autodidacts	The stunningly ambitious subtitle to Penrose's latest gift to the world, \\"A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe\\", is at one and the same time tongue in cheek, since Penrose is cheerfully aware of how far we are yet from knowing the deepest laws of the universe, and perfectly serious, since Penrose wants to equip the diligent reader with the tools to understand all the central issues at the frontiers of 21st century physics. <br /> <br />The key word here is \\"diligent\\". How tough is this book? For anyone with three or four years of university math under their belt, it will be pretty straightforward going, with tons of beauties and \\"ah-hahs\\" along the way. Penrose aims to provide the central intuitions, and not get bogged down in petty details. As one of a handful of the world's premiere mathematical physicists, he has a firm (and all the more valuable for being slightly idiosyncratic) grasp on what is truly central, and that lets him condense his enormous subject into a mere 1040 pages. <br /> <br />He provides just enough in the way of exercises, unobtrusively tucked into footnotes and handily classified as easy, medium, and hard, to let you check that you are really following along. When dealing with tensors and bundles, which are the language of general relativity and of all the unified theories, he takes care to say most things three times: in the coordinate free language preferred by mathematicians, in the \\"Einstein summation convention\\" language preferred by physicists, and in his own diagrammatic notation; so he gives you three chances to get it. <br /> <br />His intent is to be accessible to anyone who isn't mathphobic. A determined reader with a rough grasp of basic calculus concepts is likely to find he has achieved that intent. The learning curve is steep, but all the steps are in place. If you've read any two of Penrose's \\"Emperor's New Mind\\", Green's \\"Elegant Universe\\", and Hawking's \\"Brief History of Time\\", and found them stimulating rather thandaunting, then you're ready to tackle this one. <br /> <br />The book deals with all the mathematical machinery it will need in the first 300-odd pages. Relativity follows, then quantum theory, then particle physics and quantum field theory, then cosmology. Penrose always has a fresh perspective, spending a few paragraphs to take a step or two back for a broader, more philosophical view of the territory than the textbooks offer; but all this material, up to page 780, has become standard physics. <br /> <br />Then the pure fun begins. Roger Penrose has never allowed his considerable stature to get in the way of the pleasure of contrarianism, and his take on the Big Kabloona Question, how to reconcile quantum mechanics with general relativity, is as well defended as it is unusual. His longest chapter respectfully spells out the details of the most popular approach to a unified theory, that of strings and branes. But he has always been skeptical of string theory, not just on grounds of verifiability, but also because he feels it fails to involve complex numbers at its foundation. So Road To Reality provides extensive summaries of two leading rival theories: loop quantum gravity, and the twistor theory which Sir Roger and his students have developed over the last several decades. He also discusses at length the notion he originally proposed in \\"Shadows of the Mind\\", that gravitational fields may be responsible for the collapse of Schroedinger wave packets. <br /> <br />No volume with the ambitions of this one has existed until now, and no one is better equipped than Penrose to achieve those ambitions, nor could one ask for a more congenial companion or a livelier guide. It belongs on the shelf of every one who aspires to know the real skinny on where physics is, and where it is likely to go in the near future.	2005-02-26

Knowing that I was a Christian - though scarcely any of the reviewers here would agree with that assessment, since I have no doubt that Darwin was right, a criterion that seems to matter more these days than relying on the blood of Christ for salvation - he passed it along to me. <br /> <br />Ross didn't change my mind about anything. He has a good grasp of astronomy, and explains it pretty well, but I would suggest he's out of his depth in those rare passages when he argues directly against evolution. I'm not his intended audience, obviously. He wants to speak to those who adhere to young-earth creationism, or to those who are wavering in their faith because they have been told you that you can't be a Christian and also believe the universe is more than a few thousand years old. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, he won me over. This is someone I would be proud to worship with: he approaches his subject, and his adversaries (be they secular or young-earth creationists) with civility, \\"gentleness, meekness, self-control\\". Attributes not uncommon in my experience among biblical inerrantists, but rarely on display from any side when creationism is the topic. <br /> <br />Ross's central concern is what the Bible has to say about creation. Of his 23 chapters, only four deal with the astronomical evidence for an old universe. One of those, and a couple of others, deal with arguments for intelligent design drawn from astronomy (and as one who's delved deeply into both astronomy and biology, I think those are the most solid ID arguments at the moment.) Most, however, deal with general issues of biblical interpretation, and with the biblical evidence for an old universe. This is a man who is serious about placing his trust in the Bible. <br /> <br />That the book displays the fruits of the Spirit is the most important reason for my 4 stars. But it also displays considerable freshness of insight. Since I take all of Genesis 1 to be metaphorical, I have no dog in the \\"day-age/ 24 hour day\\" fight. It seems to me both sides have pretty good knock-'em-down prooftexts, which would lead to a draw if it weren't for the fact that a certain spirit of conformity in the church makes people prefer to go with the crowd rather than to play Berean and dig deep. But Ross offers a raft of biblical arguments for day-age that I hadn't seen before, as well as new links between 20th century cosmology and the language of the Bible. (For example, the passage about God \\"stretching the heavens like a tent\\" has been a trifle embarrassing to biblical literalists, since it seems to suggest the stars and planets sit in a two-dimensional sheet over the earth. But as Ross points out, something very like this is an analogy frequently used to explain the Big Bang: the 3-dimensional universe expands as the surface of a 4-dimensional sphere, and students are often encouraged to picture a stretching 2-dimensional sheet as a guide to understanding the theory.) <br /> <br />Ross's chief motivation - other than a respect for truth, and a desire to set forth the truth as he understands it - is evangelical. Many millions of people, having been exposed to and convinced by the overwhelming physical evidence for the great age of the universe, will think of Christianity as just a pack of irrelevant nonsense, if they are told that one must reject essentially all of science in order to accept Christ. There is an offense of the Cross - but this isn't it. If the day-age interpretation of Genesis is correct, then rather than the offence of the Cross, this is just a fence around the Cross, placed there by Christians too stubborn to distinguish tithes and cummin from \\"the weightier things of the law\\"; and Ross fears its effect will be to keep sinners from crossing over into life. (\\"Too stubborn\\" is my phrasing; I think Ross would find a kinder way to say it.) <br /> <br />In my own judgment, the insistenceon discarding the theory of evolution is another such fence. Most of those who can't get past the \\"six literal days\\" fence won't be able to get past that one either. But many may; and this makes Ross's contribution a valuable one. <br /> <br />One final word of my own. Those who insist that the Bible \\"plainly\\" speaks of 24-hour days in Genesis (and for that matter, those who insist that it \\"plainly\\" speaks of age-long days, or that the first 11 chapters of Genesis are \\"plainly\\" to be taken as literal history) are not merely reading what's in front of them. They are accepting what other men have told them about how the Bible \\"must\\" be read. Whenever you hear someone say: \\"God said it, I believe it, that settles it,\\" what they are actually saying is, \\"I say God said it, I believe it, and I say that settles it.\\" It may masquerade as humility before \\"God's word\\", but it is more often pride, or a fearful conformity to churchified traditions of men. <br /> <br />Everyone who picks up the Bible and reads is placing an interpretation on what he sees. The only protection against mistaking one's own, or one's congregation's, ideas for \\"what God says\\" is prayerful humility before God, and a loving openness to what fellow Christians everywhere find when they look in His word, and when they look into the new hearts He has given them. That's what I found in this book, and that's why I can heartily recommend it to creationists of all stripes.	2005-02-11

Books	4	9	9	N	N	Where short stories grow tall and wild	No one has ever bothered to attempt to imitate him, because it plainly can't be done. There was only one R. A. Lafferty, and there will never be another. But oh, how he multiplies and throngs when you enter the halls of mirrors where he presides!    Lafferty doesn't knuckle under to the discipline of the narrative arc, preferring to leap from peak to peak. As a result, his novels can be as exhausting as they are exhilarating. So it's best to acclimate to him via his short stories, which tend to be taller than other short stories are. He doesn't bother with character development; his protagonists are either blank canvases written upon by the dire finger of events, or else implausibly talented off-centrics. He only sometimes bothers with plot. The tales are jazz riffs on outlandish notions, extended with always comic, sometimes sinister, and preposterously casual flair, pure joy of invention. Nobody, at least nobody like me, can listen to just one.     Most of his work has been out of print, and praise is due to Wildside Press for bringing so much of it back. The classic short story collection \\"Nine Hundred Grandmothers\\" has thankfully stayed available, and is the best place to start. This volume, unlike \\"Lafferty in Orbit\\", is all new stories, not overlapping with Grandmothers, and is the best place to continue. Then you're ready to tackle the novels.    My personal favorites are \\"Boomer Flats\\", in which three Magi come to a nonexistent river town to be born, to flirt with abominable snow girls, and take field notes on pool playing comets. \\"The Man Underneath\\", in which a stage magician, with the aid of his beautiful assistant Veronica, disappears into his disappearing act. \\"The Groaning Hinges of the World\\", described in the preceding review. And the one about Adam's three brothers, who didn't fall under the curse, and the one about the mayor looking for an honorable way to sell out his city, and the one about the headhunting asteroid claimjumper...    Okay, so I liked them all. Four and a half stars, but only by comparison with the five star \\"Grandmothers\\".	2005-02-08

A robust, biblical Christianity stands on all three legs. But the criticism naturally falls hardest on the right, because (as the ideologues of \\"faith\\" so readily forget) \\"the greatest of these is charity.\\" <br /> <br />Wallis's message is the same as it's always been. Secular liberals may be a little readier to hear it after the recent string of progressive defeats. Wallis believes - but then he's hopeful by nature and vocation - that evangelicals are readier to hear it these days, too. Here's hoping he's right on both counts. <br /> <br />The book falls roughly into three parts. The first discusses war and peace, and the Iraq war in particular, in the light of the blindingly obvious fact that Jesus and the prophets stood for peace. Unlike many critics of Bush's policies, he makes no judgments on the President's character; Wallis has met with him and liked him just fine.  <br /> <br />But on war and peace he takes very strong issue with the President's bad theology. That theology is bad on at least four counts. First, one of Jesus' most frequent commands was \\"Fear not\\"; but the administration has encouraged Americans to be in perpetual fear of the terrorist enemy. Second, the President appears to subscribe to what theologian Walter Wink has called \\"the myth of redemptive violence\\": that evil lies only in \\"evildoers\\"; that there is no evil in us; and that we can be saved completely from evil by killing the evildoers. Needless to say, this is squarely opposed to the New Testament prescription. <br /> <br />Third, our current leaders have rejected both the pacifist and the \\"just war\\" sides of the Christian tradition, to wage a war that has been identified as unjust by every church and religious body worldwide which chose to comment on it, with the sole exception of the Southern Baptist Convention. <br /> <br />Fourth,although Bush lards his speeches with language from the Bible and from old Protestant hymns, he misapplies the language. The old hymn speaks of \\"the wonder working power\\" of Christ's sacrificial love. Bush speaks of \\"the wonder working power\\" of America. Again and again, he takes language originally reserved for God, and applies it to the nation. The correct theological term for this is \\"idolatry\\". <br /> <br />The second main section deals with the biblical attitude toward poverty. Again, Christians throughout the world understand what is emphasized throughout the Bible in continual drumbeat: God judges men and nations primarily by how they care for the weakest and the poorest. Only in America, under the influence of the religious right, have most theologically conservative Protestants forgotten this, or at least forgotten to preach it. The secular and those in mainline churches underestimate how easily that dormant concern could be called forth.  <br /> <br />Wallis urges a solution oriented approach to ending poverty, which discards labels of left and right, recognizing that poverty cannot be ended without insisting on both personal responsibility from the poor, to fix a broken culture and broken families; and social responsibility from the government, to fix the structural evils that lock the working poor in place. <br /> <br />The third, shorter, section of the book deals with the \\"family values\\" issues. Himself pro-life and opposed to gay marriage, Wallis argues that the way the media game of \\"Let's you and him fight\\" is played forces people to opposite ends of the room, when there is plenty of leeway to work on goals both sides would agree on. (Here, I think he is right about abortion, where the goals of both sides would be furthered by providing single mothers with economic supports; and overly optimistic about middle ground on gay rights.) <br /> <br />Some secular reviewers have been made uneasy by Wallis's message. That's okay; a prophet who fails to make everyone uneasy isn't doing his job. But I think they miss the way the book presents Martin Luther King Jr. as the model for religious engagement in politics. King spoke always and proudly from his own religious convictions; but his appeal to others was always to reason and a shared sense of justice. His speeches and actions were drenched in his faith, but they excluded no human being. Progressive men and women of faith should enter the public square in the same spirit today.	2005-02-02

There must be millions of us who share Michael Chabon's enjoyment of both literary fiction and genre fiction, and count among our greatest pleasures works that live on the border between. But it's not that easy to summon up that borderland at will, and in this grab bag of poplit, dallying with the genres of fantasy, thriller, and horror, there are as many pieces that fizzle as there are pieces that pop. <br /> <br />I agree with the other reviewers that the finest of the lot is from the hitherto unkown Jason Roberts, whose \\"7C\\" ushers in the end of the world with the intensity of delirium, the clarity of a theorem, and a chilling tendresse all its own. By itself, it's worth the price of entry. We will, I hope, be hearing much more from Roberts. <br /> <br />No one experiments with the Gothic form more freely or successfully than Joyce Carol Oates, and her Poe tribute \\"The Fabled Lighthouse at Vina del Mar\\", with its claustrophobic Galapogan landscape of mental decay, is another high point. Daniel Handler's \\"Delmonico\\" is another tribute, bringing Spider Robinson's Callahan's Saloon out of SF into the world of the hardboiled private eye, a journey which only improves its genial flavor. <br /> <br />Other standouts are \\"Zeroville\\", an eerie trip into the metaphysic of film; Jonathan Lethem's deceptively straightforward and naturalistic antiromance \\"Vivian Relf\\"; and China Mieville's tale of a secret society of urban naturalists, \\"Reports of Certain Events in London\\", a marked departure from his usual style that suits the story like a glove.  <br /> <br />Most of the big marquee names here (Poppy Z. Brite, Stephen King, and Margaret Atwood) turn in solid journeyman offerings, but not ones that will linger in your memory. A few of the stories - \\"Minnow\\", \\"The Child\\", \\"The Scheme of Things\\" - are derivative one-finger exercises that may not make it into your short term memory. <br /> <br />If you're prepared to sift the gems from the chert, you'll be well rewarded by this collection.	2005-01-24

So this volume seemed a good bet. <br /> <br />Good Omens starts off on a roll. Page one, with its Edenic serpent named Crawly, drew a guffaw. Sister Mary Loquacious, and the serpent's 20th century transmogrification into an oily Leisure Suit Larry, and the delightfully fractured pseudo 15th century English of Agnes Nutter, witch, that infallible and luckless prophetess, sparked one chortle after another. <br /> <br />But then the pleasurable inventiveness slacked off, and the nearer Armageddon approached, the more the plot began to plod and strain. It became apparent that the book, composed some fifteen years ago, was a gentle takeoff on eighties pop demonology, from The Exorcist to the interminable Omen sequels. Because the present, more serious, mania over the Left Behind books cries out for a more stinging brand of satire, the whole enterprise started feeling kind of dated to me. The cover blurbs promise a worthy successor to Hitchhiker's Guide. A tall order that, and not surprisingly, it wasn't delivered. I understand the blurbers' temptation to make the claim; the Guide's wry British understatement, and Prefect-like bumbling are there. But Doug Adams' best features, those cosmic non sequiturs and inescapable twists of demented logic, weren't forthcoming.  <br /> <br />Overall, it was pretty funny, fairly engaging, and the plot didn't feel contrived until quite near the end. Underlying it all, and largely compensating for the lack of bite in the satire, is a firm streak of humane common sense in both our authors. <br /> <br />I wouldn't warn anyone away from this likable confection. But it's a poor place to start to get a fix on Gaiman's sizable talents. I'll seek out Discworld soon, trusting that the same will prove true of Pratchett. <br />	2005-01-23

Besides the tight plotting, sinister edge, and note-perfect dialogue, they all carried a kind of implicit moral heft. <br />So, despite its being manifestly better than 90% of the crime novels out there on the top lists, I was a bit disappointed in this venture. The plot meanders, its wheels amiably clanking rather than being ominously greased, and the cold-blooded killers we're supposed to root for seem to have nothing over the ones we're supposed to root against, except for a better sense of style. There goes that moral heft.<br />The rest of the master's strengths are still on display, though.  And if it's not a page turner throughout, there are only a few slow stretches. There's the aging, philandering high-diver. The endearingly daffy subculture of Civil War re-enactors. The smoothly enigmatic blues fan from Chicago, arranging for a victory in his turf war with the inept local Mafia, which he intends to be as precisely choreographed as the battle of Brice's Cross Roads.<br />They all make for solid entertainment. But on the whole this will become more memorable within the canon of films based on Leonard (once the inevitable movie is made) than within the canon of his books.	2004-05-16

It attempts to dispel widespread stereotypes about what kinds of kids like math and excel at it, by presenting an insider's chronicle of the world's premiere mathematics competition for high schoolers, the International Mathematical Olympiad; by presenting its contestants as the well rounded, competitive mental athletes they are; and by conveying some of the suspense, thrill and mystique of that annual event.<br />For those who sit down and read through the slim volume, it will probably achieve those goals. But I don't think it's likely to command the attention of the general population it seems to be aimed at. For each of the members of the 2001 US Olympiad team, we get a thumbnail biography, an assessment of the particular mathematical strengths he brings to the contest, and a walkthrough of the mental path he followed to solve one of the Olympiad problems. (Since each Olympiad consists of six problems, and each country's team of six students, this scheme affords neat and complete coverage of the two-day meet.) We learn enough about each student to explode any preconception of geekdom, but most of the portraits remain too generic to give us a sense that we know the subjects personally; they tend to blur together in the mind by the time the next chapter rushes past. <br />But if the human interest isn't quite vivid enough to ensnare the reader not already engaged with math, the mathematical interest is far too lightly touched on to engage the mathematically mature, even though the problems themselves will intrigue them. The skimpy detail of the &quot;answers in the back&quot;  would not have earned many marks from the contest judges. On some, I was able to fill in the gaps; on others, nearly all gap, I was left scratching my head. Olson seems fascinated by the process of mathematical thought, and has many interesting (if inconclusive) things to say about it; but to the math itself, the stuff that actually sets these kids' minds on fire, I felt he gave pretty short shrift. Perhaps this was a necessary sacrifice to keep from driving away the important bloc of readers who may care little for math, but who still understand how important it is for our kids and schools to care about it.<br />There are particular audiences that will find this a valuable and even indispensable read, because no other author has even attempted to take the subject on at a popular level. I only award four stars to books I feel I can recommend without reservation, but for anyone who may find themselves dealing with the Olympiad, or its many feeder tests in middle school and high school, I would hasten to make that unreserved recommendation. That includes middle and high school math teachers, friends and parents of mathematically talented students (and as Olson makes clear, many an Olympian thinks of him or herself as only pretty good at math until problem solving is taken up as a sport) as well those students themselves, wondering what the world of problem solving tournaments might be like.<br />About half of each chapter deals with some aspect of psychology or public policy related to the nurturing of mathematical talent, briefly exploring the controversies without taking any final positions. Those readers who teach may find these discourses thought provoking; the other members of the book's special audience will find them easy enough to skim through to get to the good parts.	2004-05-09

I haven't been a full-blown fan, but I've absorbed several volumes of discussion and criticism. In depth of detail, documentation, readability and balance, this one is head and shoulders above anything else I've seen. Once I track down Daniel Harms' Encyclopedia Cthuliana, I'll be able to toss my old Lin Carter. Hey, it was about to start flaking and putrescing anyway.<br />I snapped up the Simon version of the Necronomicon the month Avon released it in 1980. I won't bore you with the tale here, but so many unsettling synchronicities attended the purchase that I didn't have the nerve to read through it for over a year. So my mind has definitely been open to taking it seriously. At the same time, I was familiar enough with HPL's descriptions of the mad Arab's book to know it didn't match up, and was at least partly hoax. What a pleasure to find that nearly a third of this book discusses Simon's opus, exploring it from just about every angle. I found the authors' conclusions completely convincing.<br />Harms is a Lovecraft scholar; he gets almost a third of the book to discuss the history of the Necronomicon as an artifact of the fiction written by HPL and his circle. Even if you are one of those fans who share Howard's complete confidence that the only things that ever really go bump in the night are turns of bad plumbing, this part of the book alone justifies its space on your shelf. There's a bit of biography, a look into the evidence on sources, and a masterfully clear timeline of how, story by story, the notion of the Necronomicon was fleshed out. Harms sticks to business, discussing the Cthulhu mythos only to the extent that it bears directly on some detail about the book. (The one thing I missed seeing here was a catalogue of all the other non-existent companion titles dreamed up by Bloch and Smith and Derleth and the crew.) A reasonably complete list of published titles purporting tobe the Necronomicon, with summaries and evaluations, is here too.<br />Then Mr. Gonce picks up the story from the perspective of the impact of the idea of the Necronomicon on the occult subculture. Of the many supposed &quot;Necronomicons&quot; on offer, only a few claim to include usable spells and rituals. And of these, only the Simon volume is sufficiently explicit and complete to have enticed any significant number of readers to try the contents out. The results have been, as Warren Zevon might have put it, not that pretty at all. So the core of the book devotes itself to untangling the origins of the Simon version, explaining why it is a hoax, and looking at the phenomenon of the many cults, most of them very tiny, that have sprung up around that hoax. Its grimoire is a pastiche from many incompatible cultures and some invokings invented out of whole cloth. As a practicing pagan, Gonce believes many of these individual spells &quot;work&quot;, but the incoherence of the whole system means they don't work very well, and amateurs will get into magickal trouble because the book doesn't indicate how to banish what is invoked. For practicing skeptics in his readership, he provides sobering examples of manipulative cults and even murders, which show that you don't need to believe in magick to know that in the hands of alienated teens the Simon edition is bad juju.<br />All this is rounded off with a hilarious roll call of films and TV shows that have played off the Necronomicon meme. Many of the film reviews are several pages long, with plot synopses probably more entertaining than the movies themselves. And then each is scored for fidelity to Lovecraft.<br />If you have only one book about Lovecraft in your library, other than a biography, this is probably the one you want. If your circle of friends includes dabblers (or adepts) in magick, it definitely is.	2004-04-20

He hasn't got so much as half an eye on the market. The \\"Baroque Cycle\\", begun in Quicksilver, is not sci fi, not technothriller, not like anything he's done before (unless it's the brilliant local temporal color of the Macarthur scenes at the start of Cryptonomicon.) If you open it expecting a repeat, you will, like many of these reviewers, be disappointed. Neal's made his pile; now he writes to please and to challenge himself, and we're welcome along for the ride if we like.<br />I like.<br />Quicksilver falls roughly into thirds. It begins in England with the life of Daniel Waterhouse, a delightfully morose if wavering Puritan, groupie of natural philosophers (since \\"scientists\\" hadn't been invented yet)and sometime roommate of Isaac Newton. Among much else, he is to the late 17th century what the nerd is to the late 20th.  As he moves between the worlds of the Royal Society and the Stuart court, more camera than participant, his lens gives us a penetrating view of the roots of modern science and commerce, the way they looked to a world that still interpreted them in archaic terms. <br />The second part, patterned on Tom Jones, is as replete with swordplay and ribaldry as the first part is with intellectual rewards. Across all of Europe, it follows the adventures of Jack Shaftoe, a London urchin turned mercenary, and the dazzling  Eliza, exile from the fogbound isle of Qwghlm and initiate into the highest arts of the Ottoman harem. The final section begins knitting the two worlds together, Britain and continent, science and derring-do.<br />Historical novels typically engage us by putting characters like our ourselves into the exotic settings of another time. This does something far more interesting and difficult: it portrays the time through minds like theirs, not like ours. People who take seriously issues like alchemy, apocalypse, gunpowder markets and the divine right of kings. I found the change of mental weather wonderfully refreshing. Best of all was the dialogue, almost all of which consists of adroit fencing matches, in which diplomacy, intrigue, and sexual one-upmanship are carried on between the lines.<br />On pp. 265-266, Leibniz pays his first visit to London, and explains to Daniel, as the latter escorts him to meet Hooke and the rest, the pleasure he's taken in studying numerous paintings of London prior to his arrival:<BR>\\"Each painter can view the city from only one standpoint at a time, so he will move about the place, and paint it from a hilltop on one side, then a tower on the other, then from a grand intersection in the middle -- all on the same canvas. When we look at the canvas, then, we glimpse in a small way how God understands the universe -- for he sees it from every point of view at once. By populating the world with so many different minds, each with its own point of view, God gives us a suggestion of what it means to be omniscient.\\" (The reader familiar with Leibniz's metaphysics will understand how neatly this expresses the place of the deity in his monadology. But you don't have to know all that for the conversation to make sense. The book is jammed with such erudition, much of it just as unobtrusive.)<br /> This book, similarly, is more a grand landscape of its century than a story. Rather than a plot, it contains many little scenes  drawn from several different points of view. The Leibniz we see in the first part, the brilliant philosophe, inventor of calculus and visionary of the universal binary language to come, seems like a completely different character from the Leibniz of part two, the foppish \\"doctor\\" addicted to cheap novels and unworkable mining schemes. But what differs is the characters viewing them: the neurotonic Daniel Waterhouse, his mind deep in the birth of modern science at the Royal Society; and the mesotonic Jack Shaftoe, a man of headstrong action and no book learning whatsoever. <br />I was riveted from beginningto end.	2004-04-19

Still do, rereading some of the old stuff. But why, I wonder, do I keep expecting him to come back into form?<br />He's still a master of pacing, hurling you on through the pages. But it's like the Cheshire cat, fading til only the smile is left: any clear premise, plotting that involves actual cause and effect, and all the other accoutrements of narrative, have been wafting away, til now only that heart-pounding pace remains. <br />Koontz didn't convince me that any of these characters were real: the miraculously sweet autistic brother, the pair of misfits, thrown together because the same mad scientist attacked them both with a mysterious hypodermic needle, who are destined to fall in love because at the start they're always at each other's throats for no reason. Uh-huh.<br />That hypodermic induces wild talents - a familiar Koontz theme by now. But why do the talents have to be meta-wild? The mad scientist's brew has &quot;a different effect on each subject, not always lethal.&quot; What ever happened to the speculative fiction principle of introducing one otherworldly variable, and playing out its consequences? When everything's otherworldly, the plot loses its logic and gets flabby.<br />And then there's the usual chase by nightmare agents of some shadowy power, from which the government can't protect you. But this time, neither the agents' motives, nor their powers, nor the limits to their powers, ever become clear. It's just one long series of chase scenes with no particular rhyme or reason. And a new character, a paterfamilias ex machina, appears out of nowhere to resolve all our heroes' difficulties at the end.<br />Oh, I won't deny it qualifies as readable. But somewhere in the book of counted sorrows, Koontz's declining attention to his craft is adding to the count.	2004-04-04

(***1/2)<BR>Over the last sixty years or so, a kind of opposite of Gresham's law seems to have taken over in children's literature: good books have been driving out bad. If I'd encountered Artemis Fowl at the age of 11, I'd have been giddy with delight. But with writers like Pullman, Jones, Sachar, and Rowlings out there, this series comes out as second rank. It's a quick, funny, inventive, rollicking read, but not one that's likely to become a memory still treasured in adulthood. The characters (the 12 year old criminal mastermind with a heart of gold, the hulking family retainer with battle skills to make a black belt look pale, the technosavvy centaur so plainly ripped off from Ian Fleming's Q) are rather cartoonish, although the captured LEPrecon Holly has a bit more depth. For all its clever surprises, the plot seems carelessly constructed. The Victorians distinguished between \\"fancy\\", which played with concepts in a lighthearted way, and \\"imagination\\", which summoned pictures that could touch the soul. Artemis Fowl is composed entirely of fancy. Not that there's anything *wrong* with that.<br />Having said as much, it's a fine way for a kid, or even an adult, to spend a couple of afternoons until something better comes along. There's the excitement of breaking the simple code of Gnommish, the faery \\"language\\". The basic conceit - that the parts of the story told from the fairies' point of view takes the form of a hardboiled police procedural, gently satirizing all the cliches of the genre - plays out smoothly and naturally, and couldn't be fresher. There's just enough grossout humor to keep a generation raised on Captain Underpants contented. And there are several hints that the series to follow will not just be episodic, but may unfold into a seriocomic epic of relations between human \\"Mud Men\\" and fairy folk, perhaps with the health of the planet they share held in the balance.	2004-03-14
US	52084271	R2NH5G55Y0V8A9	038550313X	174875218	Rubicon: The Last Years of the Roman Republic	Books	5	155	175	N	N	A riveting panorama of the last great democracy's decline	The Roman republic, the world of SPQR (&quot;Senatus populusque Romanus), has always been for me a set of brightly colored slides, snapshots of highlighted moments in jumbled order: Spartacus' crucified army, Caesar stabbed in the Forum, Cleopatra dying on a barge in Atrium, Hannibal crossing the Alps, Cato and Cicero holding crowds spellbound orating about something or other, net and trident facing spear and shield in the gladiatorial circle. And of  course, Caesar returning from long years in Gaul, on the bank of the Rubicon.<br />This compulsively readable book put it all together in one seamless narrative, and replaced my slides with a breathtaking movie that has it all: epic battles, dynastic soap opera, noble patriotism, eyecatching eccentricity, treacherously shifting alliances, scheming and backstabbing and dazzling hypocrisy, with the survival of a great democracy always at stake and always at risk. Holland pumps an incredible quantity of information into your head, with each personage and event so naturally connected to its neighbor that you don't feel surfeited.  As a result, every component has the benefit of a richly detailed context. <br />What's best is the confidence with which Holland conveys the ethos of the Republic, which is surprisingly alien, yet has points of analogy with our own. Though plenty of plundering and graft goes on, only one major figure, Crassus, acts mainly out of pecuniary motives. Nevertheless, as our own capitalistic democracy's dynamism has been driven by the relentless competition for scarce monetary resources, the Roman republic derived its energy from a relentless competition for &quot;glory&quot;, the scarce commodity of high reputation. The intensity, the near desperation, of that drive pushed the borders of Roman conquest outward, increasing the glory of the state and the welfare of its citizenry.  But the competition was a centrifugal force, and as the state enlarged, that force ineluctably grew out of balance with thecentripetal forces of community and tradition. Ultimately it would burst through the bounds set by the Roman constitution.<br />The first chapter sets out the history of the first centuries of the Republic, from the overthrow of the king Tarquinius by the first Brutus, through the Carthaginian wars and the murders of the populist Gracchae. The focus grows finer, and the rest of the book deals with the first century B.C. By the time Julius Caesar takes center stage about halfway through, you understand just what is traditional and what is new and nervy about his progress through a sequence of elective offices. He spent years as a brilliant politician, assuming and leaving the severely term-limited highest office of consulship, before he ever set foot in the field as a military commander.<br />Holland views almost all these characters with a dry, urbane humor, never accepting their own rosy conception of their motives. The only ones who come out looking admirable are the crotchety but forthright Cato, the conspirator Brutus, and (though only in his second persona, after he's completed his bloody destruction of the last remnants of democracy), Caesar Augustus.<br />I'll be keeping this one around to re-read from time to time. The story alone is that engaging, besides which there's endless fodder for thought. What a pity we no longer learn about this stuff as schoolchildren.	2004-03-10

The way I judge a pop physics book is: are things described in enough detail that I can sense the shape of the math behind it? By that criterion, the two finest works in the genre over the last decade have been Guth's &quot;Inflation&quot;, and Greene's &quot;The Elegant Universe&quot;. So, a newly minted book by Greene was too enticing to pass up, even though a glance at the table of contents showed there would be a lot of overlap with his first book.<br />His gift for vivid and visual explanation is as strong as ever. The depth of detail that charmed me before is mostly missing this time around. Partly that's because he's aiming at a somewhat less sophisticated reader; and partly it's because he's cast a much wider net. Rather than providing a tutorial on string theory, with other topics brought in only as necessary to that end, he is recounting the history in physics of the notions of space and time. (To anyone interested in pursuing the earlier parts of that history in greater depth, let me recommend Max Jammer's classic &quot;Concepts of Space&quot;.)<br />Some repetition is unavoidable, since Greene can't assume the reader has already gone through &quot;The Elegant Universe&quot;. Even so, he manages a fresh take on most of the duplicated material. In this treatment, for instance, Newtonian space, special and general relativity are all introduced through the unusual lens of Mach's principle.<br />But a good deal is new. A much compressed treatment of string theory, and short shrift allotted to particle physics and black holes, lets Greene expand considerably on quantum theory, the nature of entanglement, the origins of the arrow of time, and the several incarnations of cosmological inflation theory. In particular, he describes the competing current interpretations of the &quot;collapse of the wave packet&quot;, in just four pages, which is as clear, as accurate, and as scrupulously fair to the proponents of each, as any forty page discussion you're likely to find elsewhere.<br />The marvels of twentieth century physics have become too extensive to be captured, even superficially, in any one volume. But if someone unfamiliar with those marvels wanted to get some sort of handle on them with just one book, this one would be in strong contention to be that book. It's lively, breezy, but also mind-stretching and precise. Those who have already read several such volumes, though, and want to dive a little further below the surface, will be better served by Greene's first work.<br />No harm in reading both, though. I just did, and had a fine old time. This is the gentler of the two, and the better place to start.	2004-02-27

Rather than shell out goodbucks for DaVinci Code, I decided to sample Mr. Brown in softcover first. Now I can understand, more or less, why &quot;Code&quot; has taken the bestseller list by storm. If it's like &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot;, it isn't worth the adulation it's received, but it's pure fun to read. A beautifully paced thriller, with so many things going on (all but the kitchen sink: multiple secrete societies, geometric and alphabetic and architectural conundrums, particle physics and Renaissance history, secret tunnels and public corpses, all with a papal election and - hmm, is that a cherry on top?) that your head will be turning faster than the pages. That Brown keeps all these dancers twirling on the same stage without losing the beat bespeaks an impressive skill.<br />Plus, enough of the subthemes (that architecture, those quickie physics lessons in the CERN basement) have a tincture of the intellectual about them to add considerable snob appeal to the mix. Brown doesn't quite get the physics right, which makes me wonder how far to trust some of his other intellectually dazzling bits. But I sure *felt* smarter reading about them! And why complain, so long as us customers leave feeling satisfied? I also got irritated every now and then by whiffs, sometimes more and sometimes less gentle, of anti-Catholicism. But then, I'm a Protestant; I'd guess most Catholics would be used to this sort of thing and take it in stride; and it certainly didn't add up to outright hostility.<br />Conclusion: I will read DaVinci Code, but I'm more than content to wait for the paperback.<br />So take it to the beach, by all means. And be prepared to stay up so late you miss your morning swim the next day. Just don't expect anything like a religious experience out of it.	2004-02-23

But it's a little white lie. Since this sort of book always attracts dozens of 1 star reviews from &quot;reviewers&quot; who never bothered to read it, I thought I'd cut Al a little slack.<br />The style of humor here is the type we've grown to know and love, or know and hate, depending. That is to say, Franken imitates an over-the-top, foam-mouthed hurler of vile epithets, going so far overboard that no one (except his targets) could possibly take him seriously, meanwhile utterly failing to hide the pussycat within.<br />He does get seriously angry (and seriously unfunny) in only one chapter. He takes the matter personally because Paul Wellstone was a personal friend of Franken's (as he was of so many.)  It's the chapter detailing how the right wing successfully planted the meme that 20 seconds of endlessly played clips, pulled out of the four-hour memorial service for Paul Wellstone and the family and friends who went down with his plane, constituted proof that the whole event was a partisan hack job. That was, of course, a lie. Fox and friends found the only political 20 seconds of the evening, distributed them on endless tapeloop, ignored the three hours of tributes to the others who died, lied again about Republicans being &quot;booed off stage&quot; (there was a barely audible smattering of boos at a single point, when the camera picked up Trent Lott in the crowd - a clip that was never shown on the media, because the applause drowning out the boos would have contradicted the preferred lie of the moment), and got all the &quot;liberal&quot; media to echo their howls of indignation. Echoing was easier for CNN and the gang than sitting through four hours - or even ten minutes - of tape to learn what actually went on.<br />For the rest, Franken has five targets here: Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, and Sean Hannity, each of whom is savaged mercilessly simply by juxtaposing a few of their blatant untruths side by side with the facts of the case. None of them are accorded any quarter, and none of them, shameless and basically nonstop prevaricators all, deserve any.  The other two faces at the center of the dartboard are corrected more gently: liar-in-chief George Bush, and the lazy &quot;Why check out a lie when you can just<BR>report it?&quot; media.<br />Yes, it's funny. Very little of it is laugh out loud funny, but it's at least up to Franken's usual standard of risibility. If you liked his other stuff, you'll like this every bit as well. He is not as entertaining (in the punch line per page sense anyway), nor as angry, as Michael Moore. He is, happily, every bit as unbalanced as that worthy. But he is considerably more fair. He documents everything he says, and like Santa checks it twice. Unless he can delegate the checking to his elves. Or as he himself assures us, &quot;Thanks to Team Franken, you can rest assured that almost every fact in this book is correct. Either that, or it's a joke.&quot;<br />If there's a difference between this and his earlier bestsellers, it's the quantity of good solid political ammunition it contains:  hard facts, hard quotes, lie after lie nailed to the wall and spread out like an entomological specimen for all the world to see. Though much of this ammunition is expended on already dead horses (the &quot;credibility&quot; of the Coulter O'Reilly Hannity triad), the rest is potentially handy. Once you've chuckled your way through the book, you might want to feed it to any friends who are suffering from information malnutrition thanks to Fox and the Fox wannabes.  They might just perk up far enough to take those TV IVs out of their arms.	2004-02-23

In the two volumes of &quot;Speaks the Nightbird&quot; (and don't buy this one without buying the other. They are a single story, not a novel and a sequel; and there is no danger that your interest will flag), he strikes out for a new territory: historical Gothic. And there he takes up residence and reigns.<br />In the Carolinas in the 1600s, a fair-minded judge and his inquisitive clerk make the dangerous journey into the wilderness to the beleaguered colony of Fount Royal, to hear and pass judgment on the case of Rachel, an accused witch. From the opening set-piece, a narrow escape at a slovenly wayside inn, which stews in a man-made miasma of evil more bone chilling than any supernatural bogie, we're in the presence of a master storyteller. <br />When our protagonists arrive at Fount Royal and start investigating, Rachel's prospects look ever more grim. In formal testimony, eyewitnesses swear to her congress with the Devil, and they clearly believe their stories. Meanwhile the clerk's informal inquiries turn up unspoken rottenness under every log; some evil deeper than witchcraft is destroying the colony. But can he piece out what it is, from far too many clues, before Rachel is claimed by the flames?<br />The puzzle of the town's two murders, the appalling and touching secret lives of its inhabitants, the exotic presence of the alien otherworld that presses on its edge, full of Spaniards, swamps, pirates, and Indians, introduce a riot of memorable macguffins and details. Every promise is kept, every gun displayed in Act One is fired before the final curtain, and in the meantime the suspense and the grand guignol never let up. This is a model of well made, gripping, intelligent narrative. <br />It's closer in spirit to his earlier works, in the horror genre, than it is to his three more recent books. But he's more grounded and sober than he was then, with a subtler touch drawing characters. Both the horrors and the victories over them are now governed by a respect for the limits of the real world.	2004-02-22

Bush, you don't want to read this book. If you are beginning to have doubts about him, you might want to - but there are a ton of worthy exposes of his lies and depradations out there, which are as well documented and easier to read. If you just want to curl up by the fire for a good red-meat Bush bashing, this won't be your cup of tea at all.<br />Phillips is a historian first; an American second; a conservative with a conscience third. Because of the first, he is meticulous in his detail. Because of the second, he's deeply alarmed at the slide away from the Founders' ideals the last few decades have brought us. Because of the third, he feels betrayed by the way the Bush family has magnified the power of central government for the sake of crony capitalism - neither of which used to be a conservative or a Republican value. (Also because of the third, he pulls no punches in assigning LBJ and Clinton their share of blame for the long slide, in occasional asides. But the Bush clan is his centerpiece, and he mainly stays on point.)<br />As always with Phillips, the writing style is dry, and his organization permits him a fair amount of repetition. And as always, he lines his ducks neatly in a row before setting them out to swim.<br />My English profs taught me the word \\"conceit\\". It's the name for a strained metaphor, for which an author draws out the parallels at elaborate length. \\"American Dynasty\\" deals with very diffuse subject matter: the makeup of the American ruling elite (in both parties) across the last century; how its power has consolidated and grown less answerable to the people; and how the Bush family has plugged in, at many small points of contact, to all the major institutions that accord power to that ruling elite. To impose a sense of order on this material, he chooses to speak of the parallels between the Bush family ascendancy and various dynastic restorations of former times - the Bourbons after Napoleon, the Stuarts after Cromwell, and so on. This constitutes a conceit, and I don't think it's a particularly convincing one. But it does enliven all that detail with a kind of master narrative.<br />The book will be indispensable to anyone who wants to trace the sources of George W. Bush's power, to know what favors he owes to whom, what favors have been called in, and what favors he is likely to raid the U.S. treasury to pay back in the future. Links to the oil industry, the banking industry, the military industrial complex, the intelligence world - many of them only cursorily explored by other writers - are mapped out here, with names and dates, not only for George II, but for his relatively honest father and his equally corrupt siblings.<br />Phillips is careful. He investigates at length the business dealings of grandfather Prescott Bush with Germany during the Third Reich, a topic much muttered about on the Left. He concludes that those dealings were nothing unusual, were shut down well before the war, and mainly involved contacts with an old guard of monarchists rather than with Nazis. On the other hand, he looks at the evidence for an \\"October surprise\\" - most of which surfaced *after* the congressional hearing on the topic - and finds for a high likelihood that yes, Poppa Bush was involved in keeping the Iranian hostages captive until after Carter's defeat.<br />His previous \\"Wealth and Democracy\\" is much more clear as a call to arms over the parlous state of the country. This offering, with its useful index, works best as a reference work for journalists, historians, or opposition researchers. <br />The Bush story is crammed full of shadowy dealings with poorly reported, less than famous characters on the fringes of entities like Harken and BCCI, Skull and Bones, Enron, the CIA and Zapata oil. The very complexity of the corruption keeps it from becoming front page news. Now you can start with any name, go to the index here, and follow the thread through the weave: into the text, back out to the notes, and on to sources. If that sort of digging appeals to you, make sure you have this book ready at hand.	2004-02-22

She promptly accepts another mission to nanny a crew of starry eyed, deep pocketed SETI enthusiasts. There's a mysterious signal emanating from an otherwise lifeless and undistinguised double neutron star system, and they mean to check it out. The signal beam, leading on to relays, becomes a thread that traces a labyrinthine interstellar trail, with surprises and dangers at each turning. Does the trail have an end? Will the Contact Society finally meet beings from another advanced civilization face to face?<br />The hard science on display, and the Clarke-like restraint in not showing us too much of either the creators of the signal or the primitive aliens met along the way, had for me a comforting old-timey sci-fi feel. The book is good journeyman sf, with a few breathtaking sense-of-wonder scenes, and quite a few bursts of suspense that will keep you turning pages briskly through several chapters at a time.<br />On the downside, it also presents a few dry stretches. The repeated &quot;oh, please, don't tell me you're going into that basement alone&quot; recklessness of the Contact fans begins to stretch credulity, not to mention stretching sympathy for the party members mighty thin. And except for the clever and spectacular final rescue scheme, there's little here that's completely new. Nor is there much that provides food for thought once you step off the roller coaster at the end of the ride.<br />Still, if you crave your space opera with a hard science edge, &quot;Chindi&quot; is more than good enough to stave off your hunger pangs. And if some studio with a decent effects department doesn't pick up the movie option, they're missing a bet on an action packed summer blockbuster with an above average IQ.	2003-12-22

In any case, she rings a few changes in The Grave Maurice, and has a little fun paying oblique tribute to Josephine Tey and Dick Francis, without trying to imitate either one. The biggest change is that Jury is still largely sidelined, from injuries received in the previous episode, which sets Melrose Plant more front and center. Another difference is that this book is less self-contained than the rest, relying on the reader to import some back story from The Blue Last.<br />I had worried that Grimes, in a spirit of homage to Francis, would attempt to plunge into details of the horse-racing world. She couldn't have possibly competed with Francis's authenticity in that arena, but fortunately she didn't try. All the action takes place in the much more laid-back world of a stud farm, with the only races being the ghosts of remembered heats in the beautiful Philip Larkin poem that serves as the epigraph. And Martha writes several scenes from the point of view of one of the farm's retired animals, a flight of lyric fancy that would have struck Francis as silly if it had ever occurred to him. Here it works just fine.<br />The pace is very relaxed. The plot, as some negative reviewers have noted, is also laid out in a fashion relaxed enough to be count, maybe, as sloppy. After all, Jury is on a forced holiday. So the pace and the noodling turns of the case fit. And I was relieved to be spared the obligatory office visit, with Cyril's obligatory humiliation of Racer.<br />The overall mood, though quiet, remains dark. Perhaps even darker than The Blue Last. Don't expect a feel-good ending, and be prepared for a smaller than usual dose of comic relief at Long Pid.<br />It's certainly not Grimes's finest outing, but it was a decent read and in some ways a fresh approach to the series. By no means is it time yet for Grimes to put Jury and Plant out to pasture. I'm at a loss to understand the vehemence of someof the bad reviews here, which is why I've rounded my 3.5 star evaluation up rather than down.	2003-12-04

US	52084271	RAQLV8QL290XI	1585740039	208871338	The Quotable Birder	Books	4	3	3	N	N	This collection has quite a wingspan	A sister-in-law, who is a birder, gave this last Christmas to me, who am not. (My life list might just graze three dozen species.) I've taken to dipping into it daily, expecting and usually finding pleasant surprises. Hardly any of the quoted are birders, and it is birds themselves, rather than birding, that compose the subject.<br />The subject is inexhaustible, and it's hard to discern a rationale for what quotes have been included and what haven't. Maybe twenty percent of the quotations are memorable more for their arcane provenance (where on earth did he find *that*?) than their content, and not a few mention some bird or other only tangentially. But this comes to seem a strength of the collection, making it less predictable. And plenty of the quotes are either gems, or pointers to writers and speakers you might not know about and might just want to.<br />Some quotes extend to a page or two, including several of Aesop's fables. Some are just a quip (David Letterman: &quot;Fall is my favorite season in Los Angeles, watching the birds change color and fall from the trees.&quot;) or a couple lines of verse (Elizabeth Bishop: &quot;A bird arranges / Two notes at right angles.&quot;) The voices belong to politicians and poets, comedians and soldiers, scientists and travellers, scriptures and satires. Together with the famous, the anonymous, and the formerly famous but now obscure (like Poe's onetime fiancee, who wrote her own version of &quot;The Raven&quot;.)<br />In the field, one rarely gets to watch most birds for long. In that sense, these 300 pages of brief glimpses mimic the birding experience very well. But how delightful it would be if one could view those birds in the bush from as many different angles as those from which this book approaches the whole family of feathered kind.	2003-11-17
US	52084271	R3HNE0QJVVAPW	1880418568	446733041	Wolves of the Calla (Dark Tower)	Books	4	5	6	N	N	You can feel the series coiling to strike	You already love the Dark Tower saga, or you wouldn't be here reading the reviews. You don't want to have the plot given away, you just want to know - does it stack up? Is it worthy of what went before?<br />The answers are yes, and probably. When King began this project, he knew that his muse was drawing him into it, knew that he would be taking the unearthly, doomed but defiant mood of Browning's \\"Childe Roland\\" and that in the figure of Roland the Gunslinger, he would be wedding it to the American version of the knight errant. But he didn't know the shape of the plot, or even if it would all lose direction and fizzle out. He was still groping his way forward, trusting his instincts, until book four. The venture  dug deeper than his usual fare, but it also felt picaresque, improvisational, sometimes quirkily imagistic.<br />This volume makes it clear that he knows where he's going, and means to arrive there smooth and clean. There's a single clear narrative, with none of the sense of flailing around that troubled some of the earlier volumes. The wild west atmosphere has - temporarily, one hopes - gained ascendancy over Browning's edge-of-the-world eeriness. But that suits this rustic leg of the quest just fine. (I regret to report that the science fiction trappings that entered the story with Blaine the Train grow a little thicker, which also thins out the Dark Tower flavor a bit.)<br />But even as Roland's Magnificent Five (counting Jake's billy bumbler) adopt a town in trouble, prepare to face down the terrorizing gang, and add a country priest to bring the company's number to six, large forces are moving under the surface. These are both the forces within Roland's universe, which has been designed to encompass all universes, and the forces driving King's own creativity. <br />My feeling reading this instalment was, that King isn't just being cute bringing in characters and motifs from his other novels - that country priest from 'Salem's lot, and the low men inyellow coats, among others. Knowing for sure now how Roland's story will come out, he is feeling out the subconscious affinities these other stories always did have with the Dark Tower, which has after all grown up right alongside them. And the interconnection the Dark Tower forms among multiple worlds has something to do with the interconnection art makes (and King's art in particular has made) with multiple realities: fictions and legends and personal pasts.<br />I strongly suspect King knows just what he's up to. He intends the next two books to round off his career; and among other things he is now writing a story about the nature of stories. That accounts for the twists near the end that some reviewers are objecting to. In other hands, such nesting could become a tiresome post-modern trick. But post-modernists don't care much for stories; King does, and my money says he's going to do something different and interesting with the theme.<br />In the meantime this segment, with its little detour from the path of the beam, moves fluidly and grippingly, and is satisfying in its own right.	2003-11-17
US	52084271	RRPSONRQC3QYY	034543076X	138364901	Manifold: Time	Books	4	60	64	N	N	Mind candy you can get your teeth into	(***1/2)<BR>This first volume of Baxter's &quot;Manifold&quot; triad is a tour de force of exposition masquerading as fiction. The writing is plenty lively enough, but this is the kind of hard s-f (one of the more satisfying kinds, for my money) in which the plot consists less in what happens to our heroes than in what dawns on them.<br />The characters themselves are two dimensional figures, stolen from old Heinlein stock, elitist and tiresomely self-confident and too crammed with genius to be believed. But that's okay. They are only there as screens onto which Baxter can project his dazzling tutorials on topology, time travel via retarded waves, paradoxical consequences of Bayesian statistics, sound ethical justifications for destroying the universe, and cosmology as a branch of genetics, among other perfectly serious loopy ideas. Who cares if the screen is two dimensional, if the movie succeeds in adding dimensions to your mind (almost painlessly) just for the price of admission?<br />The scale of Baxter's imagination is so large that I often couldn't settle on whether what I was reading was comical or awe-inspiring. And from chapter to chapter the scale keeps expanding. Think Olaf Stapledon on speed, and you'll hit near the mark. <br />Happily, volume one is completely self contained. So much so that it's not possible to conceive of a &quot;sequel.&quot; The remaining two &quot;Manifold&quot; books take place in alternate universes that merely happen to include the same characters. So if you share my phobia of trilogies and tetralogies (&quot;Do I dare crack this book, knowing that if I even half like it I'll have to read the rest to see how it comes out?&quot;), fear no more. By the time this one volume is over, it has *all* come out, in spades. You can wait a decade or two to pick up the &quot;next&quot; volume, if you like, without dropping any threads.<br />If you like hard science fiction, you owe it to yourself to sample Baxter, and this is a fine place tostart.	2003-10-27

Mma Ramotswe has none of the infallible intelligence, the glamor or colorful pugnacity of stock detective fiction. She is an ordinary woman nearing middle age - but it would be more accurate to praise her as &quot;perfectly ordinary.&quot; Her considerable girth is emblematic of her general solidity: ambling through one small case after another, rarely sure of the next step, succeeding not because of brilliance but by dint of cheerful confidence, good humor and common sense.<br />It gives us, second, a glimpse into the day to day life of a modern African town. It is perhaps a little exotic to us, but it is perfectly natural to Mma Ramotswe, and her familiarity with and affection for the social order, the dry expanses of the Kalahari, the flow of favors expended and called in, lure us into seeing it all simply from her point of view, as just the way things are at home. It kept reminding me, oddly enough, of the small town life in Tom Sawyer. There have been many presentations of Africa as the Dark Continent. Here we have a credible portrait of it as the Sunny Continent, as it can be in those times and polities where history is kind enough to leave it alone for a while. <br />It gives us, third, a break. The language is as simple and direct, though not as self-consciously so, as Hemingway's. Even when witchcraft and child murder darken the storyline, the pace is unhurried, the goodness of a shared cup of tea and a back porch conversation celebrated. The pain of all Africa's history touches our heroine's life, and colors the edges of the story; the vastness of the interior somehow generates and gets reflected in the personal dignity of the townspeople; yet everything takes place on a human scale. It is hard to imagine anyone sitting down with this book and coming away less than disarmed.	2003-10-23

Al Franken has explained the difference between the mild tones of NPR and the sustained howling screech of rightwing radio: when liberals turn on the news, they're looking for information, but when conservatives do, they're looking for ammunition.<br />Michael Moore here offers another heaping, steaming helping of ammunition with a generous side of information. What's interesting is how little overlap there is between this and two other (and even better) recent liberal ordnance depots, Greg Palast's superb \\"The Best Democracy Money Can Buy\\", and Al Franken's \\"Lying Liars...\\" The list of Bush administration blunders, corruptions, depradations, lies, and perfidies stretches so long that it would take half a dozen volumes just to scratch the surface. So start out with those two books, by all means, but then feel free to move on to Mike's latest. You need fear little redundancy if you go ahead and collect a complete set.<br />All three have wonderful, extensive endnotes. Not only do they show you how to back up every appalling factual claim (or in some instances, like Moore's extended peek at the Bush code of silence over terrorist connections to their Saudi business friends, every intriguing unanswered question). Happily, they also provide specific and practical suggestions for action.<br />Happily, indeed. Moore himself is an actual leftie, a Nader fan who for instance is not above suggesting that gas pipeline rights were a major motive for the Afghanistan war. But all \\"liberals\\" - and as the rightist radicals in charge have redefined the term, that would include everyone from Eisenhower to Nixon to Goldwater - have now been battered and bullied to the point where they are no longer content just to vote once a year and then grouse. Even as a centrist, you can learn enough from this and the aforementioned companion volumes to promote politics from a spectator sport to a contact sport. And perhaps even to win everybody's country back.<br />Because as Michael rightly documents, this has always been a liberal country, and ordinary Americans today are more liberal than they've ever been. Only a firesale on democracy has allowed us to be governed by a claque opposed to the majority's interests and our beliefs for so long. Their time may be growing short. And this book should help tick the clock forward.<br />Special kudos for the delicious chapter which Moore explains how to talk to your conservative brother-in-law! First butter him up with Michael's funny and accurate four page list of things you can safely admit liberals have got wrong. Then, instead of appealing to his compassionate nature, point out in plain English exactly how the adoption of liberal principles will help to make him richer.	2003-10-10
US	52084271	R14ZVKZGJL6UWQ	0765303671	340488847	Spaceland: A Novel of the Fourth Dimension (Tom Doherty Associates Books)	Books	3	7	7	N	N	A sprightly homage to Abbott	Spaceland isn't the first attempt to honor Abbott's classic \\"Flatland\\", it won't be the last, and it probably won't be the best. And it isn't, by a fair stretch, Rudy Rucker's best novel. But it's a rollicking comic strip of a ride. It's every bit as good at teaching neophytes about the fourth dimension as its model, and (dare I say it?) in prose that's far less tedious. (For one thing, Rucker's hero Joe Cube unabashedly explores the sexual possibilities of every dimension he enters. Don't assign this text for extra credit to your sixth grade math class.)<br />It's superior to most other updates of \\"Flatland\\", in that it captures the full flavor of the original, which was one third math instruction, one third humane philosophical musing, and one third sharp social satire. As a professional mathematician, and perhaps the best popularizer of math around today in nonfiction, Rucker is more than equal to the first task. The war between the sort-of-animals living on one 4D \\"side\\" of our universe, and the Loki-like sort-of-plants dwelling on the other, takes on a nearly theological dimension before it's through, although it's a zany kind of Pixar-production theology drawn in primary colors. Rucker's satirical target is less timeless than the simple bead that Abbott drew on heirarchy and stratification: Silicon Valley society at its frenetic dot-com peak. Better read it now while it's still funny - but it sure is comical now. <br />What Rudy Rucker does best is to take a premise, build consequences on it, then tease out meta-consequences and meta meta consequences in a dizzying tower of speculation. His fiction can be pretty mind blowing. He doesn't build his tower all that high in this effort. But maybe he just didn't feel it was fitting, in a tribute, to upstage old Edwin too far.	2003-09-24

Why is it the time? Because our basic constitutional rights are under the most vigorous full frontal assault since the Civil War, and possibly of our whole history.<br />Previous assaults have all taken place in time of war. But always in time of a real war, that is to say, military actions undertaken against identifiable enemy states, ending in clear victory or withdrawal. The \\"war on terror\\" is a struggle against a permanent class of shadowy enemies.  Al Qaeda is a serious threat, but while there may not always be an Al Qaeda, there will always be terrorists. Any freedom we relinquish only for the duration of the \\"war\\" on terror will be a freedom we lose forever.<br />Hentoff wastes no words. He doesn't rant, preferring to quote the sober judgments of the Supreme Court and the Founding Fathers. He gives us a quick but reasonably thorough overview of the many blows Ashcroft's Justice Department has rained on the Bill of Rights, the separation of powers, and the principle of an open government accountable to the people. He provides the dates and notable contents of the bills, the executive orders, and the arrogations of power, usually sufficiently sourced to follow the dots in Google to the full texts. He brings the story right up to date (including the Justice Department's own stinging inspector general's report from June of 2003).<br />And though the crisis is urgent, Hentoff offers a lot of hope. Because, as he also documents, Americans from the grass roots to Congress, of all political persuasions, have started waking up to the danger and taking action.<br />Don't be confused by the one-star reviews. This is in no sense a partisan book, except to the extent that Franklin, Adams and Jefferson were partisans of liberty. Ashcroft is thoroughly bashed, but Bush hardly comes in for a mention. There are as many Republican heroes credited here - Dick Armey, Charles Grassley, Bob Barr, even Grover Norquist - as there are Democratic ones. The Bill of Rights, after all, is the common glory of every American. Ashcroft's claim, for example, (sustained by the fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on December 8, 2002) that any President and any  Attorney General have the right, on their sole say-so, to imprison any American citizen indefinitely without charges or legal representation, is a declaration of war on the spirit of America, and of everyone who values freedom. That's Democrats, Republicans, Greens, Libertarians, and independents alike.<br />It's short. It's alarmed because the times are alarming, but it's measured in tone. It's packed with information you *should* have been reading in your paper. Do yourself and your country a favor, and read it.	2003-09-21

What he sets forth, in supple, thoughtful, smoothly readable prose, is the saga of recent advances in \\"life extension\\" - both longevity research and research into the healing and regeneration of tissues with the aid of stem cells. As his title suggests, the emphasis is on the scientists involved, and on the public face of that science.<br />Along the way, he clarifies a good deal of the science itself: the discovery of the Hayflick limit, the finite limit to the number of times a normal cell can divide; the  connection of that limit to the telomeres, the shoelace-tips on the ends of chromosomes; the chimerical enzyme telomerase, two parts protein and one part RNA, which repairs the telomeres and helps make cancer cells immortal; the sir-1 gene and its congeners which can double or sextuple your lifespan, if you happen to be a roundworm. And so on. Little of this will be news to those laymen who follow the science pages closely, but even for us it's good to have the timeline neatly laid out.<br />The bulk of Hall's attention, though, goes to the rivalries between laboratories to be first to publish and patent each of these breakthroughs; to the lineages of the biotech startups bankrolling the races; to the contrast between the solid if limited gains made by the biologists and the fairy dust sprinkled on investors; and to the enormous ferment surrounding all these new technologies as they began to impinge on embryonic stem cells and thereapeutic cloning.<br />Wandering through the scene from chapter to chapter, popping up repeatedly whenever the action gets hot, is the energetic true believer Michael West, the ousted founder of the premiere telomere outfit Geron, and the leading light of Advanced Cell Technology, which set the country on its ear two years ago with a premature announcement that it had cloned a human embryo. In his infectious zeal for abolishing the tyranny of old age, West serves not only as a central figure in the unfolding commercial and political saga, but as a stand-in for the insistent voice in all of us, whispering that all men may be mortal, but hey, maybe *you* can beat the rap.<br />Hall's conclusion, offered with a full appreciation of the fact that \\"It's hard to predict things, especially the future,\\" is that a dramatic cure for aging is not likely to be in the cards.  Just as cancer turned out to be a whole class of diseases with a host of different causes, so aging is turning out to be more complex than the discipline's pioneers imagined. What we can reasonably expect is a steady advancement of the average life span over the coming century, by another decade or two. How long we have to wait for breakthroughs in tissue regeneration in particular will likely depend less on science than on politics.<br />Two intriguing lines of lifespan research, the one tracking the sir family of genes, and the one investigating the effects of free radicals, are not ignored but, perhaps because they haven't caught the public fancy sharply, get relatively short shrift. Less than halfway through the book, the spotlight shifts from the study of aging to the study of stem cells. Because the U.S. for the last quarter century has enjoyed an effective moratorium on experimentation with aborted fetuses or discarded IVC embryos, American scientists' attention has focused more and more on the other theoretical way of obtaining human embryos: inserting the nucleus of an adult cell into an enucleated human egg.<br />If anyone were to succeed in doing that, and coaxing the result to divide until it reached the blastocyst stage - that would be \\"therapeutic cloning.\\" So far, no one's done it, or at any rate no one who's done it has felt like advertising it. In a political squaring of the circle, President Bush managed to permit NIH to fund limited therapeutic cloning in a way that ended up outlawing  funding in practical terms. As a result, scientistsin the field face the classic NRA nightmare: when federal stem cells are outlawed, only maverick venture capitalists will have stem cells. At press time, no one knows what's really happening, what kind of ethical oversight private companies are bothering to put in place, or how restricted access to resulting medical breakthroughs will be when it's all proprietary, with no NIH ownership at all. For the moment, the U.S. is stuck with the worst of the \\"pro-life\\" and the \\"mad scientist\\" worlds, while the rest of the world does its research in the sunlight and steals a technical march on us.<br />All the players on both sides of that circle-squaring, and the principal shakers, movers and move-blockers in the relevant research, are profiled here, some in full screen 3-d and some in fetching thumbnails. The field is unlikely to be surveyed by a more complete or more even handed chronicler for some while.	2003-09-01

Unfortunately, he didn't spell out how to conduct the test. And so the church has always had some factions wanting to play it safe, and admit no \\"spirits\\", no further revelation or prophecy of any kind, for fear of admitting godless elements; and other factions ready to lend credence to every huckster and pythoness who claimed to have \\"a word from the Lord.\\" This book argues that the first such division arose between the Gallic church father Irenaeus, and the gnostic house churches that were proliferating in western Europe under the persecutions of the second century.<br />Those who have read any of Pagels' previous works, from \\"The Gnostic Gospels\\" on, will not be surprised to learn that Pagels sides with the house churches who embraced continuing (if often suspect) revelation. But I was pleasantly surprised by the degree of sympathy she extends to Irenaeus, who turns out to be the book's central character. When the martyrdom of the old bishop thrust the oversight of the region's spiritual welfare upon him, the faith seemed to be in double jeopardy: from the external threat of pagan violence, and from centrifugal forces that seemed likely to dissolve the church from the inside. The prime engines of those centrifugal forces were the proliferating pseudepigraphal gospels and acts and testaments emanating from the mystics, philosophers and visionaries we think of today as the gnostics. So Irenaeus attempted to establish a center by declaring just four books to be authentic gospels: the synoptics (Matthew, Mark, Luke) already accepted by all the Christian zoo, and his own favorite, John. A gospel which, by Pagels' account, was composed specifically to counter the growing influence of the mystic, philosophical, visionary \\"Thomas church\\", the community that gave birth to the Gospel of Thomas. And in those first gambits in the shaping of the canon, Irenaeus ended up inventing orthodoxy itself.<BR> <BR>This is good solid Pagels. Her fans (and I count myself one) know what to expect, and her fans won't be disappointed. In this outing, she doesn't speak exclusively in her academic voice. I found the brief excursions into her personal spiritual experience worthwhile: it teaches us to hear the right tone of voice in which to read her previous work.<br />Let me be clear about what this book is not. Those who are looking for a close reading - or any sort of explicit reading - of the Gospel of Thomas, should look elsewhere. Similarly, those looking for a primer on the doctrine, practices, and worldview of the gnostics will find it here only in very sketchy form. <br />What I found valuable was the detailed look at Irenaeus and his milieu; the arguments (potent but too few to be conclusive) for the notion that the author of John was trying to counter the \\"Thomas church\\" precept that God is immediately accessible to each person in the same way that He was accessible to Jesus; and the insight that \\"discernment of the spirits\\" was the critical practical issue dividing gnosticism from orthodoxy. What I found disappointing was that though Pagels raises the essential question, \\"How are the spirits to be discerned?\\", she gets no further than to reject the orthodox answer \\"Pay no attention to Paul's advice, reject all spirits\\", and to half heartedly endorse the gnostic answer \\"Pay no attention to Paul's advice, welcome all spirits.\\"<br />I think the Apostle would have been grieved at the false dichotomy.<br />Still, it's thoughtful, personally engaging, informed, and I for one found plenty to chew on and some good detailed review of church history, made a lot more interesting than it ever seemed in Eusebius. Recommended.	2003-07-25

This one just doesn't cut the mustard.<br />It starts out with all his cylinders clicking as usual. We get some convincing, heart-in-mouth deep sea exploration footage. We get a plausible and intriguing science fiction premise about how a bit of archaic bacteriology could turn us all into Lazarus Long, and it really makes sense that it leads to our hero poking around in the Juan De Fuca trench.  We get a couple of neat scientists we'd like to see a bit more of, and we get an unsettling, mysterious series of phone calls from dead people.<br />Unfortunately, the phone calls remain mysterious - or at least only lamely explained. The well thought out longevity theme gets swallowed up in a slapped together bacterial mind control theme. Characters we cared about disappear, and characters we never get time to know wander on and off stage.<br />In short, it's a terrific first reel. But don't buy any popcorn, because you may find yourself ready to leave the theater before you get to the bottom of the bucket. <br />Bear can do, and always has done, better than this. And the first third shows he still has the stuff. I won't be dissuaded from trying out his next offering.	2003-07-15
US	52084271	R2NOMNP3I0LWO5	0060185163	725298314	God's Secretaries: The Making of the King James Bible	Books	4	11	13	N	N	Rich discussion of the skimpy evidence	The fifty-odd men who accepted King James I's commission to translate the Bible into English didn't leave much of a paper trail, and most of the records that did exist were destroyed by fire before the century was out. Over the seven years it took to complete the work, six separate &quot;companies&quot;, each assigned a major segment of the Bible, thrashed out the wording in innumerable meetings; and then the principals joined together to review the whole work.  Out of all that hive of activity, we have actual minutes of only one conclave, in 39 pages discovered serendipitously  in the 1950s.<br />In the face of this paucity of hard documentation, Nicolson draws his account out to book length by examining the personalities, theological sympathies, and careers of a dozen individual translators, and by limning the political and theological atmosphere of England under King James: its extravagance and its horror of extravagance, its insatiable appetite for three hour sermons and for generous decolletage, and its capacity for combining fierce and ascetic intellectualism with passionate feeling, a capacity we've forgotten the Puritans were capable of, and pretty much lost the knack of ourselves.<br />All these characters of the age found their way into the irreplaceable, apposite music of the King James Bible: in its unhurried pace, its direct Anglo-Saxon vocabulary set in those sonorous rhythms that even in 1611 harked back to an older diction; in its frank refusal to clothe the heavy-breathing Song of Songs in euphemisms; in the countless precise choices that left ambiguities in the original unresolved, and so secured the peace; in the Translators' conscious plan to compile majestic words fit to present to a majestic king.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed the book. It will appeal more to history buffs than it will to most people who spend a lot of time actually reading the KJV. For us in the 21st century, politics and theology are two realms with a great gulf fixed between them, and the story spelled out here will sound like it had far more to do with government than with God. As Nicolson ably explains, that wouldn't have been the Translators' point of view at all. Their mental and spiritual world, for which the divine right of kings was a life and death issue, and a faith issue, barely intersects with our own. And it connects only slightly more solidly with the world modern fundamentalists inhabit. It is remarkable that the six companies' labor produced so much language that still speaks to us so intimately and insistently, and seems to dissolve the divide. It's a tribute both to their literary skill, and to their unparalleled fidelity to the original, timeless text.<br />The making of the KJV is a picture that can never be painted. &quot;God's Secretaries&quot; does a fine job of sketching the surroundings, sometimes in glorious Rembrandtian oils. (Nicolson's own style has the evenly paced dignity common to the seventeenth century texts he has steeped himself in.) But the central figures, their actual writing and translating, is lost in the chiaroscuro of history. The best periscope into the minds of the translators is still going to be found by opening the Authorized Version itself.	2003-07-15

He is the most silver-tongued American philosopher since William James, bursting with fresh insights, sizzling with curiosity, ready to pull the perfect vivifying metaphor out of his pocket on any occasion. He never oversimplifies, yet like James writes with colloquial clarity. And few philosophers work as hard to avoid straw men, doing justice to both the meat and the spirit of opposing thinkers. He is never less than a pleasure to read.<br />\\"Freedom Evolves\\" isn't as seminal or as tightly argued as Dennett's 5-star classic \\"Consciousness Explained\\". But it is still brilliant, and essential reading for anyone who thinks about free will.<br />The book's burden in a nutshell: The traditional metaphysical wrangle over freedom of the will is simply beside the point. All of the practical and ethical benefits we want \\"free will\\" to accomplish for us - a sense of control over our own destiny; an anchor for personal responsibility, punishment and reward; and the ability to say \\"I could have done otherwise\\" and mean it - are entirely compatible with the most thoroughgoing determinism. And anyway there's no practical way ever to distinguish between a determined decision and one which (whether by the grace of quantum mechanics or some ghost in the machine) is indeterminate. So we should take heart, take pleasure in the freedom our common sense tells us we enjoy, then concentrate on expanding the political freedom of all humans, and on taking responsibility for the expanded choices our technology affords us.<br />His central new trick is to spell out a new concept that walks like free will, and quacks like free will. Using an example from the libertarian John Austin, who wrote about how he \\"could have made\\" a golf putt he actually missed, Dennett observes that Austin is not really saying he could have made the putt under *exactly* the same circumstances.  Rather, Austin was claiming that he could have made it under circumstances *indistinguishable* from those which really obtained. Even under determinism, any world state we perceive at a given moment will be fuzzy; we would have perceived not only the actual world at that moment, but any of a host of similar worlds, as being \\"the same.\\" And even under determinism, it makes perfect sense to say that among the (determinate) futures of that collection of similar worlds are some futures in which Austin made his putt. That, Dennett argues (convincingly) is what Austin *really* meant by \\"I could have sunk precisely that putt\\"; and (less convincingly) what everybody means when they say such things in real life. And (convincingly again) that this determinate-world, fuzzy-proposition interpretation of \\"I could have done otherwise\\" provides all the elbow room needed to satisfy the free-will druthers of the man on the street.<br />In this discussion, Dennett pulls a bit of a fast one: he drops into the modal logic jargon common to philosophers these days, and calls these similar worlds \\"possible worlds\\". Actually, if determinism is true, no world other than the one that happened was really possible, and only a professional philosopher or an artificial intelligence maven would be prone to fall for the equivocation. But his point carries despite the legerdemain. His gloss on \\"possible\\" is a *possible* meaning for possible, and it does afford the benefits he claims for it. Sure, the old metaphysical quarrel is left unresolved. But Dennett's point is that what really matters to most participants in free will debates is not the metaphysics of it, but the social and ethical fallout.<br />Along the way there are stimulating and illuminating discussions of the phenomenon of temptation (it arises because mammals like ourselves discount future gains on a hyperbolic rather than an exponential curve), and of the waysin which freedom expanded over the course of evolution, right up to the emergence of \\"free will\\" - i.e., of self conscious deliberation over reasons for actions, in a way that allows for the sense of \\"could have done otherwise.\\"<br />Even opponents (like myself) of materialistic monism will find a lot to take away from Dennett's analysis, because only parts of chapter 8 actually rely on that odious doctrine. The kind of \\"free will\\" he describes winds up being the same, and equally useful to have, regardless of whether the underlying cosmology is   monist or dualist, determinist or libertarian. And the same goes for his dissection of temptation and of character development. In the best Jamesian (and likewise the best Wittgensteinian) tradition, he manages to be philosophically pertinent while bypassing metaphysics altogether.<br />He makes a good case that his limited modified hang-out version of free will is practically indistinguishable from the traditional kind. He concludes that the traditional kind is therefore not worth fretting over. For a secular thinker like himself, that's probably so. But some of his readers will not be secular thinkers. It's worth noting that those readers will have a valid reason to care about the difference.<br />After all, the free will debate in Western philosophy really began with Augustine, who had a non-secular motive: human beings have to have free will in order to absolve God from the moral evils humans commit. And though Austin couldn't distinguish between the world in which he failed to make his putt, and the nearby worlds in which he would have, they would be distinguishable to God - whereupon all of the \\"could have done otherwises\\" would shrink back to a deterministic dot.	2003-07-07

It attracted millions of adherents for awhile, but first Harry Houdini devoted himself to debunking mediums and replicating their \\"manifestations\\" on the cheap, and then the surviving founder confessed in her old age that the original raps and tipped tables were simple tricks that she and her sister had concocted to give their mother a little scare. And the Zeitgeist just changed; what had once appealed to leading intellectuals like Emerson and Susan B. Anthony began to feel like lowbrow credulity to younger lights.<br />So spiritualism survives only spottily. But in one town, Lily Dale, not far from its Empire State birthplace, its whole way of life continues as a kind of living fossil, a tribute to the determination of human beings to go on believing. In this case, to go on believing that countless spirits of the dead hover around us, eager to communicate, even if the message is usually trivial or vapid or vague; eager to wobble the furniture and make banging noises on cue. Christine Wicker, a longtime religion correspondent for the Dallas Morning News, made the trek northeast to try to learn how people come to embrace beliefs that seem not merely absurd but downright out of fashion.<br />To her considerable credit, Wicker really wants to understand the residents of Lily Dale, rather than to pass judgment on them. She wants to discover what mediumship feels like to the medium; why    people find a deep emotional connection to \\"messages\\" from  departed loved ones that on paper look pointless or suspiciously generic. By the time she's through, Wicker accomplishes those  modest goals. She also bumps up repeatedly both against things  she can't explain, and things she can explain all too easily. The  mystery and the chicanery almost seem to cancel each other out -  but they can't cancel out the unique atmosphere of the town: foggy but warm, Victorian but never prissy, and always crackling with expectation.<br />As a primer of spiritualist doctrine, the book doesn't amount to  much. The residents seem to share a common set of practices more  than an articulated common set of beliefs, anyway. As a tool for  settling the truth value of spiritualism's claims, it amounts to  even less. But the author never intended her book to serve those  purposes. It does lay out some intriguing historic vignettes. The main focus is on the present day, on the individual mediums the author meets, their personalities, personal histories, the  stories they like to tell and the stories they like to tell on  each other, and the happy contrivances by which the small society  they've built together rattles along. The accent is more on their  humanity than on their eccentricity. Before you're through, you  get to feel that this is a place and a community you know pretty  well. If that's what you come to the book expecting, you will be  amply rewarded. <br />I found Ms. Wicker a little too ready for my taste to accord the  benefit of the doubt, but a good balance between open mindedness  and skepticism isn't easy to strike. Overall she's hit near the mark. This is in part a story about her own spiritual travels, so  it would have been pointless to assume an air of cool   objectivity. Besides, she's scrupulous about reporting her own experiences and observations separately from her attempts to interpret them. Clearly, the Dallas Morning News has lucked into  a professional, and I'm happy they've shared her talents with the rest of  us.	2003-05-18
US	52084271	R5R30GG7W0FVI	0807043389	123652352	Gathering Power: The Future of Progressive Politics in America	Books	4	14	14	N	N	Sweat Equity as the key to political power	I picked up &quot;Gathering Power&quot; in the hope that it might be a prescription and prediction for progressives on how to take command of the country again, something like an update of Kevin Phillip's &quot;The Emerging Republican Majority&quot;, only for the good guys. What Osterman lays on the table is something quite different.<br />Specifically, it's a handbook on how to do effective local political organizing, in the mode that was pioneered seven decades back by Saul Alinsky, and has continued ever since. It's kept the same basic shape but acquired a few bells and whistles (such as respect for women as leaders) along the way. Sticking to &quot;write what you know&quot;, Osterman draws all the book's examples from his experiences with the Industrial Areas Foundation (IAF) in the American southwest, especially in the Rio Grande valley.<br />The principles behind this style of organizing are simple, hard headed, sometimes a little surprising. And the book makes a convincing case that they really do work. But there would seem to be two caveats.<br />The first is that it takes an awful lot of really hard work from an awful lot of people. And most of that hard work consists of trolling for and recruiting &quot;leaders&quot; (the volunteers who are the public face of the movement) and &quot;organizers&quot; (the paid staffers who provide training and continuity for the leaders).  It feels a bit like those charities that end up spending 80% of their effort on fundraising. But (sigh!) no one's discovered a more efficient way to get to IAF's results - improved streets and schools on the unimproved side of the tracks, living wage laws and branch libraries. So we might as well grit our teeth and roll up our sleeves.<br />The second problem is that, cheerful as Osterman tries to be about it, it doesn't appear as if his model scales up any further than (at most) the state level. For one thing, the techniques have been around for a lifetime, and haven't hit the big leagues yet. In which case, all this work would have only a secondary effect at the national level: namely, the demonstrable fact that people who've been touched by local organizing get turned into voters.<br />Why no scale-up? As Osterman justly observes, the only sources of political power are &quot;organized money&quot; and &quot;organized people&quot;. Organized money works from the top down, and exercises its influence through capitol lobbying and mass media. In the IAF system, organized people work from the bottom up, and exercise all their influence in face to face meetings - first with each other (with agenda items percolating from house meetings up through quarterly caucuses of the entire local membership), and secondly with politicians (who are supported if they commit to agenda items, then carefully tracked, and who lose support if they don't follow through.) It's unclear how agenda formation could add the needed couple of layers, and remain both coherent and genuinely bottom-up. And it's unclear how a membership too large to fit in a room and too dispersed to confront the politicos face to face could hold &quot;responsibility sessions.&quot;<br />Still, there's indispensable wisdom here for anyone wanting to extend political power to the disenfranchised on local and regional levels, and plenty of food for thought if you're wondering how to re-engage the swollen ranks of nonvoters so as to gain some progressive traction on national issues.	2003-05-11

Dick	Books	4	21	23	N	N	Meetings with a remarkable man	Two things were always true with Philip K. Dick: first, that whenever you looked in the direction in which he waves his wand, nothing was as it seems.  And second, that whenever you looked at the magician himself, what you saw was what you got.<br />In this collection of transcripts of taped interviews, made with Dick during what turned out to be his last weeks on earth, we are treated to the unedited, off-the-cuff ramblings of the master. Are they worth it? They are, on at least four counts.<br />The first pleasure is just hearing his voice again. The second is learning various little bits that we didn't know before: about his reactions to seeing the first rushes of _Blade Runner_, which was just going into editing (he was pleased and enthusiastic, and not at all put out that the whole Mercerism theme was excised.) And about the book he was planning to begin next, The Owl in Daylight. The third pleasure is watching his creative process unfold as he massages the material for _The Owl_, plotting it and composing  it right before our eyes. And the fourth is the confirmation that he is as quirky, as compassionate, as obsessed, as unpredictable, as brilliant, when speaking ad libitum as he was in his written work. What we saw in his novels turns out to be what his friends always got.<br />Other major themes include his 1974 \\"pink light\\" experience, and his relationship with the characters in his last novel, The Transmigration of Timothy Archer.<br />For the completist fan, this short book is a delightful find, and one worth snapping up quick since there's no telling how long it'll be in print. But for those with only a few PKD novels under their belts, and a curiosity about what made him tick, there's a far more indispensable volume to check out first, namely the extracts from his diaries which were published in 1991 as \\"In Pursuit of Valis: Selections from the Exegesis\\".	2003-04-25
US	52084271	R1ODGZK9FNLB38	0471086010	521542550	Kepler's Conjecture: How Some of the Greatest Minds in History Helped Solve One of the Oldest Math Problems in the World	Books	3	20	22	N	N	The venerable art of squeezing cannonballs	***1/2<br />It was Sir Walter Raleigh who first posed the question: How do you cram the largest number of cannonballs into the hold of a ship? The question found its way to the great astronomer Kepler, who replied that you can't do better than to imitate the grocer's stacks of melons. The melons take up 74.05% of their allotted space, and there's no more efficient way to pack spheres of equal radius.<br />So Kepler said. But he didn't provide a valid proof. And thereby hangs a tale.<br />Szpiro tells the tale, in a thorough overview of the many assaults over the centuries on a problem that turned out to be much harder than it looked. When it finally fell in 1998 at the hands of Hales and Ferguson, the solution required, among other things, computer examinations of thousands of simultaneous linear inequalities in over a hundred unknowns. Just as most of the solution is hidden away from mathematicians in gigabytes of computer output (though they are free to examine the programs), most of the mathematics is necessarily hidden away from the reader here. But Szpiro does a good job of presenting, in visualizable terms, the ideas of the ideas of the partial and final proofs. He lays out the story on three levels, with the more intense geometrical discussions set off in smaller type from the main narrative, so the casual reader can skip around them, and with the detailed (but accessible with no more than algebra and a little trig) derivation of formulas in appendices. So each reader can customize the book to his own comfort level.<br />I'd hoped to learn about the connections to deeper questions that have made the topic of sphere packing in higher dimensions so fascinating to mathematicians - the links to coding theory, to sporadic simple groups, and to Leech's lattice. Though he touches on them briefly,  Szpiro sticks fairly closely to the two and three dimensional story. That's probably a good call.  After all, it is only in those dimensions that the problem has actuallybeen solved so far, and he was certainly in no danger of running out of material. <br />More worrisome is a certain carelessness that crops up too often. Sometimes the geometrical descriptions are unnecessarily ambiguous. A footnote says that Von Neumann \\"has been reported\\" to have been the model for Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, seeming to imply that Kubrick must have said so. (As a Jew, Von Neumann would have been a poor model for Strangelove's Nazism!) A figure on p. 222 labeled \\"Kelvin's tetrakaidekahedron\\" is really a packing of two different kinds of polyhedra described several pages further on. We are told that Paul Cohen showed there must be cardinals \\"between countability and continuum\\" - whereas what he really proved was that one may assume such cardinals exist, or assume that they do not, without introducing contradictions. On the same page, we're informed that  \\"Kurt Goedel showed that arithmetic is not free from contradictions\\", when in reality his great theorem showed only that arithmetic cannot be *proven* to be free from contradictions. Despite the distinct pleasures the book affords, flaws like these forced me to knock my rating down by half a star.	2003-02-24

In the nineties, leading man Todd Pickett, after making some bad mistakes trying to come to terms with the impending loss of his king-of-the-box-office looks, decides to go into seclusion. And his worst mistake is to rent out the vamp's long abandoned, but far from uninhabited, mansion.  <br />I never felt like putting Coldheart Canyon down, but I found myself wondering several times whether I was still reading the same book I had in my hand a hundred pages ago.  It didn't seem able to decide whether it was going to be a satire on Hollywood, or a chilling Old World folktale or a chatty gossip column on the bedroom foibles of the silent screen stars,... or a haunted house story. Ultimately, it's all those things, but not enough of any one of them to fully satisfy, and Barker doesn't succeed in making them all connect convincingly.<br />When Barker fails, though, the result is more worthwhile, and more fun to read, than the polished heights reached by most other \\"horror\\" writers. One thing you can be sure of is that he will never repeat himself, never lapse into repeating some tired successful formula.  He did neither here, and I liked the glimpses I got of the several novels this might have been, so I put it at three and a half stars.<br />Those fans who favor Barker for his mastery of horror, and his unexcelled gore, will be sorely disappointed in this novel. It's only intermittently scary. Those who follow him for his breadth of imagination and capacity for surprise, who were at least as pleased by Imagica as by Hellraiser, will find it optional, but enjoyable.  For all its arresting supernatural ornamentation, what Barker is really interested in here is obsession with fame, on the part of those who do and those who don't have it. The head of Pickett's fan club plays a major role in the story, beginning as nearly acartoon, and developing into the book's most interesting character. And it becomes clear early on that, for all the nasties Todd has to face down, his real nightmare is of being no longer adored.	2003-01-27

Like they all said, it's the Bride of the Son of the Dance of Swords.<br />If you're even reading this review, you are one of the millions like me.  Jordan's first half dozen volumes came, you saw them, and you were conquered.  So we *will* keep slogging through these things, because we can't help but care about how those characters we became enthralled with so long ago ultimately make out. Even though there's precious little lately to keep us caring.<br />I'll give it two and a half stars. There are no mighty events anywhere, and (except for the mystery of the ravaged town where Perrin travels for supplies) no new plot elements. Still, several major decisions are ultimately made; and Mat's storyline, gingerly romancing the Seanchan princess he accidentally kidnapped in the last book, is quite enjoyable.<br />But this one makes me worry deeply about the subsequent installments. Winter's Heart had me hoping for an upcoming return to form, but now I have to wonder if Jordan has completely forgotten what fascinates readers.  It's not being told, for each and every one of thirty Caemlyn courtiers, which ones have embroidery that clashes with their surcoats. And it's not being told, for each and every one of fifty Aes Sedai, which one will win a who-has-the-haughtiest-stare contest with each of the others. And it's not straining to remember, from the last volume but one, which minor character was a Darkfriend, and which one with a virtually identical name was a trustworthy hero.<br />It's not really true that *nothing* happens in this volume. If Mr. Jordan had sliced out all the page-filling tactics I just mentioned, we'd have had a talky but entirely engaging 300 page episode. My sense of wonder is not nourished by breathless observations of sartorial and pecking-order detail that could be transposed verbatim into a tale of triumph and heartbreak at an antebellum Savannah grand cotillion.<br />When volume 11 comes out, I'll wait for the paperback. It'll be easier on my wallet - and then I can go straight on to the 12th (if I still haven't given up, and I suspect I won't have) with a bit sharper recollection of which indistinguishable windfinder is apprenticed to the Kin with which distinctive hairdo.	2003-01-22

I got bored with much of the account of those four, had fun with the discussion of the sixth problem (the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, which has to do with rational points on elliptic curves), and obtained a vague picture of the remaining two.<br />My three-star rating is bound to be misleading. Keith Devlin has an enormous gift for mathematical explanation, but as he himself recognizes, in attempting to explain to the proverbial man on the street the seven Millenium Problems (for solving each of which the Clay Mathematical Institute, hoping to spur mathematical research in the 21st century somewhat as David Hilbert did with his famous set of 23 problems in the century just past, has put up a cool million American dollars), he has bitten off more than anyone could possibly chew. I don't mean to suggest it could have been done any better.<br />If you hanker to tackle the problems and win one of those millions for yourself, start hankering for some other pipe dream. These problems are tough. If you want to thoroughly understand what they consist of, you will need to go to the official technical description of the problems in the book jointly prepared by the Clay institute and the American Mathematical Society. If you want a light overview of them, there's no such thing, but this book is as good a compromise between ease and clarity as you will get. If you just want a feel for where mathematics in general stands at this point in history, the backward glance at Hilbert's problems given in &quot;The Honors Class&quot; is a better place to start.<br />The challenge for Devlin (aside from gearing up to understand the two most abstruse problems himself) was to describe the problems without assuming any knowledge on the reader's part beyond high school algebra.  So he has a humongous amount of ground to cover. With sprightly historical notes, he zips through complex numbers, complex functions, infinite sums and products, special relativity, quantum field theory, symmetry groups - and that's just the first two, easiest chapters. He does a particularly fine job, I felt, with the fifth chapter, on Poincare's conjecture. The mathematics needed for a precise statement of the conjecture is fairly daunting, but his informal description conveys the heart of it vividly and accurately. <br />All the above is subject to a major caveat. The real agenda for this volume is narrower than educating the general public. The main thing the Clay Institute wanted its prize offer to accomplish was to stir interest in math among students. Considered in those terms, I'd give it five stars, because the people who are going to lap the book up with relish are mathematically gifted high school students. If bits of each chapter go over their heads, it will only serve to whet their appetites. Because it's so ideally suited for them, I'd like to see (and I'm sure the Clay Institute would like to see) Devlin's opus in every high school library in the country.	2003-01-18

And the rule of thumb is, that people's descriptions of their fascinating dreams and trips rate right up there on the boredom<BR>meter with hole-by-hole narratives of your boss's last golf game.<br />It's not coincidence, I think, that the two great, readable narratives to come out of the psychedelia's da-glo glory days in the sixties (Wolfe's Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test) and its nightmarish decline and fall in the seventies (Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas) came from two fellows whose primary love and loyalty was to journalism. Then the substances that Daniel Pinchbeck calls \\"entheogens\\" fell into cultural eclipse, the interminable pathology known as the War on Drugs took center stage, and little original or noteworthy has been published on the topic for quite a while. Terence McKenna, brilliant but sometimes barely in touch with the real world, has had the field pretty much to himself.<br />Now we've got another entrant, not quite up to Wolfe or Thompson, but as wide ranging as McKenna, while staying more level-headed and instructive. The strengths of \\"Breaking Open the Head\\" are once again journalistic. Pinchbeck undertakes an odyssey in search of genuine shamans, who can properly initiate him into the authentic use of psychoactive plants. He takes us with us on his journey, sets us into scenes from West Africa, to the invisible perennial contemporary Woodstock in Nevada known as the Burning Man Festival, to the Amazon, to the peyote fields of Mexico, to labs in New York City where chemicals the plant kingdom never quite got around to inventing are concocted and consumed. <br />We get Pinchbeck's trip reports, yes. We also get his personal spiritual journey, and a refreshingly objective picture of what remains of traditional shamanistic cultures, and what is emerging of Western shamanism (or pseudo-shamanism, as the case may be.) Best ofall, we get his thought-provoking ruminations, goosed by his eclectic reading from Huxley to Eliade to Walter Benjamin to Rudolf Steiner, as to what this mysterious human drive to get high at almost any cost is all about. I don't think much of his answers, but his principal question is spang on: what is it about Western civilization? What gives us this chip on our shoulder about any and all forms of ecstatic consciousness, chemically assisted or not? Why is ours almost the only culture in the world to regard hallucinogenic plants with horror, rather than with reverence and<BR>respect?<br />In the final few chapters, Pinchbeck goes off the deep end, down a rabbit hole into which few of his readers will probably want to follow, convinced that there are objectively real \\"plant spirits\\" out there directing psychedelic experiences. But his reportorial instincts are so sound, that he doesn't let his ultimate views color his account of events along the way. And so we are free to ponder some of the questions he doesn't raise. Like: if these chemicals are so all-fired spiritual, why are half the traditional shamans he meets violent, or greedy, or vain? And: how is it that all the ingesters from traditional societies<BR>take the drugs to get practical advice from the spirit world on how to live their ordinary lives, while all the westerners take them in order to find Ultimate Answers, and to step outside consensus reality? With goals so different, can the Westerners' quest really lay claim to the value these substances might have within traditional cultures?<br />A lively, illuminating read, one of those books that is as fun to argue with as it is to learn from.	2003-01-14

Second, to explore the factors that control the discovery and application of new knowledge, so as to get a better grasp on why the Industrial Revolution took place in Europe, and why England might have led the way. Finally, to speculate on what I found to be a startling question: what's to prevent the explosive expansion of technology to which we have become accustomed from falling into stagnation, as lesser periods of innovation have done throughout history?<br />He accomplishes the first objective handily. Apparently some  economists believe that the Industrial Revolution must have been driven primarily by economic forces (new means of capitalization and rising demand) rather than by the availability of science, because of the multi-century lag from Kepler and Newton to the economic blastoff. But Mokyr argues that there was a necessary intermediate stage, the \\"Industrial Enlightenment\\", which structurally altered the relationship between \\"what-is\\" and \\"how-to\\" forms of knowledge, as well as making both forms radically more accessible to artisans, entrepeneurs, and the general public.<br />His explorations of the other two questions are fresh and illuminating, but a bit picaresque. There's no overarching theory here and, except for parts of the chapter on adoption of new technology by households, little quantitative rigor. Where the discussion excels is in its opening pages, which lay out a useful systematic language for talking about kinds and qualities of knowledge; in its readiness to think outside the market-explains-all box; and in its unflagging supply of vivid historical examples.<br />Among many piquant ideas, the central insight I brought away from this work was the extent to which the phenomenon of \\"science\\" is a collection of socially enabling institutions, rather than just a Baconian method. Not that Mokyr holds much brief for the notion that the conclusions of science are socially constructed. Rather,  its conclusions become accepted and transmitted, and therefore available for economic use, only by the grace of a set of social relationships and conventions that Bacon's scheme did not mandate, and which might just as easily not have taken place.<br />I should note that where economics are concerned, I'm very much a layman, and not really even a particularly informed one. (\\"Oh, Schumpeter, yeah, I heard of him somewhere.\\") I found Mokyr's text challenging but frequently engaging, and comprehensible throughout.	2003-01-12

He's entitled to lay back for one year and just phone one in from the beach, as he has here. It's worth it to accept the charges on the call. Still, anyone who hasn't made Mr. Hiaasen's acquaintance previously should begin elsewhere - with the gripping Stormy Weather, or the devastating over-the-top satire of Native Tongue. This is a perfectly decent read, but it's more predictable than I've come to expect from him, and relatively heavy on the chuckles and light on the whoops.<br />Hiaasen's anger is nearly as much of a national treasure as his sense of humor. In \\"Basket Case\\" he's packing a satirical Winchester instead of an Uzi, but keeping his sights steady. This time his target isn't despoilers of the natural environment, but despoilers of the cultural environment dearest to him - the city newsroom. The narrator, Jack Taggart, is a middle-aged reporter, working for a once-proud daily that got bought up by a national chain, dumbed down, staffed down, and milked dry for quick profit. For committing the crime of aggravated honesty over the situation, Jack's been demoted to the paper's ever-shrinking obituary page. <br />When Jimmy Stoma, former head headbanger for the bad boy band Jimmy and the Slut Puppies, buys the fish farm in deep Caribbean waters, Jack schemes to turn the story into his first front page byline in years. When Stoma's all too merry widow Cleo can't get her story straight, the scoop balloons into the trademark Hiaasen insanity, full of sharply sketched characters and of heavies made all the more dangerous by the fact that their brains must be classified as blunt instruments.<br />Yes, the frozen lizard is in there, bless its cold blooded heart. I was mildly disappointed to find no snake charmers, no tangles with the mental health establishment, or any of theother amusing double meanings with which this author's titles are usually freighted. \\"Basket Case\\" was simply the title of dead rocker Stoma's biggest radio hit back in the day. Warren Zevon collaborated with Hiaasen to write the song and escort it out from the novel into the real world, as one cut on what sadly appears to be his final album, \\"My Ride's Here\\".	2002-12-30

Judaism, Christianity and Islam represent three faiths divided by a common founder: each looks back to Abraham as the first of the faithful, and each is uplifted by the hope, as Abraham's children, to come into the inheritance of God's blessing on him and his \\"seed.\\"<br />Feiler has chosen the figure of Abraham as a concrete way to explore the question of what these three great religions have in common, how they differ, and whether our many common elements offer any credible hope that we will learn to live together in peace and mutual respect. He explores the question from Jerusalem, where the hopes of the three faiths run the highest, and where the hopes for peace these days seem dimmest. There are no facile reassurances here, but Feiler's generosity to the other two faiths, his willingness to re-imagine Abraham from their point of view as well as from his own Jewish tradition, and (no less) his refusal to paper over the controversial or the politically incorrect, convey the depth of his own determination that we have to find our way to a \\"yes.\\"<br />The book is simply written, readable in one or two sittings. It makes no pretension to being scholarly or exhaustive; it is an account of one individual's study and exploration of the question. But its simplicity is clearly the achievement of judicious selection and pruning. As fascinating as the varying portraits of the patriarch are in their own right, he recounts no story or midrash unless it illuminates the different approaches of these religions to God and to one another. He makes every anecdote count.<br />Perhaps the greatest ground for hope lies in the historical pattern he discovers: for each of the three religions of the Book, Abraham was initially understood as a common spiritual father of all mankind; and only after centuries did each tradition succumb to the temptation to lay claim to exclusive status as Abraham's heirs. Those exclusive claims have laid deep grooves by now in all three spiritual paths; but the roots remain to be rediscovered and reclaimed.<br />This book deserves to be widely read, among all three communities. It has no final answers; it is really only the barest beginning of the critical trialogue that has to take place. But its honesty, its painful urgency, its commitment to hope, and its publication in one place of narratives so long heard only within the confines of this tradition or that, make it a valuable beginning.Those exclusive claims have laid deep grooves by now in all three spiritual paths; but the roots remain to be rediscovered and reclaimed.<br />This book deserves to be widely read, among all three communities.

Hubbell's central thesis appears to be that genetic engineering is nothing to be worried about, since we've been doing genetic engineering - better known as breeding and horticulture - for thousands of years.  <br />There's a good deal to be said for that thesis (as well as a good deal to be said against it), but &quot;Shrinking the Cat&quot; doesn't get around to saying very much of it, since the bulk of the book consists of leisurely digressions. There are a few brief, half-hearted, very elementary science lessons, for those who have forgotten everything they might have heard in high school biology class.  They scarcely convey enough information to convey why people ought not be alarmed over &quot;frankenfoods&quot;, and certainly not enough information to understand the reasons why (as Hubbell acknowledges) some scientists are nevertheless worried about the implications of genetic engineering. Not a word about the sort of gene-jumping encouraged by certain G.E. techniques (like plasmids), nor about the increasing dangers of monocultures, nor about the potential damage to wild stocks by inadvertent interbreeding with engineered organisms, nor the long term danger posed to food supplies when Monsanto engineers crops to be sterile, so that farmers must return to the corporation for each and every year's supply of seeds. Though she is correct about many of the public's fears being groundless, her book will not be of any appreciable use in helping anyone understand the real technical or policy issues in any depth. <br />If you aren't expecting to learn anything serious, though, her randomly chosen facts about the history of domestication, concentrating on the beneficial development of corn, silkworms, cats, and apples, are sufficiently diverting to justify the short time it will take to browse through them. It's nice to get a two-page spread showing just where the Silk Roads ran; to be told just when and where Golden Delicious and Macintosh apples first turned up;  to learn that the Egyptian word for cat was &quot;miaw&quot;, and that Johnny Appleseed was a devout Swedenborgian, with a knapsack full of other such agreable trivia.	2002-12-13
US	52084271	R2HAMOLESNL9L2	0375508597	362018127	The Age of Sacred Terror	Books	5	63	69	N	N	Essential guide to the changed face of terrorism	Benjamin and Simon headed the National Security Council's antiterrorism team during the nineties, and they began this book in 99, hoping to convince a skeptical country that Al-Qaeda was the most serious threat facing the West. They wanted to explain why it represented a new *kind* of terrorism, and a far more dangerous kind. <br />We no longer need convincing that the threat is real; we need information and perspective. The book they wound up writing is a fountain of both. Still central to its theme and its value is their analysis of what makes Al-Qaeda different. For this new breed of terrorist, strategic considerations will never limit the level of destruction they mete out, because violence is not their tactic to gain some other end. Destruction of the infidel *is* their strategy.<br />   The first half is a crisp, brisk read jammed with vital detail on the history behind radical Islamism. That history, from the Crusades to the Balfour declaration, is ever present before the minds' eye of the terrorists, so it behooves us to know it. These are guys who know how to put together an executive summary. Without a word wasted on horrified emotion, partisan sentiment, or political correctness, they give us the names, the dates, the theologies, the actions that led to the current confrontation. You are unlikely to find a precis of Al-Qaeda's motivations and makeup anywhere as complete, concise, and pertinent.<br />In particular, Benjamin and Simon give the definitive answer to \\"why they hate us.\\" Many social, economic, and political factors go into the level of tacit support for Al Qaeda on \\"the street.\\" But the operatives themselves are motivated entirely by religion, and nothing short of the death of all Jews and the destruction of the West will satisfy them. In one sense it is true that what they peddle is a perversion of Islam. Even the virulently anti-American head of Iran's clergy, Ali Khamenei, condemned the WTC attacks, because the Quran clearly forbids targeting civilians. But at the same time, Al-Qaeda's theological line has very deep historical roots in Islam, tracing back to Wahabbi in the seventeenth century (a version of Islam which Saudi money has recently made dominant through much of Asia), to ibn Taymiyya in the thirteenth century (who held that jihad in the sense of killing unbelievers was more important than any of the traditional five pillars of Islam). And ibn Taymiyya was a kind of Reformation figure; in his exaltation of jihad, he was rejecting all of the Islamic scholarship of the preceding five centuries, and trying to return to a kind of 'sola scriptura' depending only on the Quran and the hadith, in which with one ill attested exception there was no concept of a \\"greater\\" or \\"inner\\" jihad. It is difficult for moderate Muslims to mount a theological response to the jihaddists, especially when the \\"ulemas\\", the scholarly establishment within each Muslim country, are so closely identified with governments that are repressive, or dismissive of sharia law, or both.<br />The second part talks about the developing awareness of the problem in the U.S. through the nineties, and all of the obstacles that prevented sufficient mobilization. This is less important for most of us to know than the preceding material, but the authors' position as insiders, especially in the light of partisan blame tactics sometimes used on both sides, more or less obligated them to assess that history. <br />The two most important obstacles were: (1) a mindset that saw terrorism as a tactical tool used by rogue states or liberation movements, and smugly imagined that Al-Qaeda was just more of the same. At its top levels, the Clinton administration got over this hump by 1995; and the Bush administration, initially convinced that Al-Qaeda was a minor annoyance that Clinton had blown out of proportion, climbed a steep learning curve and changed its mind by the summer of 2001. (2) The difficulty of making the sense of urgency in either administration trickle down through the federal bureaucracy, in the absence of any media appreciation of the seriousness of the threat. The only way to overcome the enormous inertia of Treasury, State, and FBI would have been to share the information that, to avoid compromising intelligence, the cabinet and NSC level people had to keep close to their chests. September 11 did a great deal to put both problems to rest, but the book warns that institutional inertia and counterproductive turf wars, especially at the FBI, still pose significant risk.<br />A third short section assesses the current state of play, and considers short and long term strategies for dealing with terrorism when it springs from a \\"virtual state\\" like Al-Qaeda. The outlook is both grim (terrorists *will* sometimes succeed, and civil liberties will be compromised) and hopeful (we have a lot of natural allies, Bush has restored the funding he originally cut for dismantling Soviet nuclear weapons, and Al-Qaeda's attempts to groom operatives who are ethnically western offers a potential handhold for better human intel.)<br />One warning worth noting: Clearly radical Islamists are the primary threat we face. But the nineties saw the emergence of apocalyptic, religiously motivated terrorists from the fringes of a variety of faiths: Judaism (Gush Emunim's assassinations and plot to dynamite the Al Aqsa mosque), Buddhism (Aum Shunrikyo's nerve gas attacks), and Christianity (Christian Identity, which nurtured Tim McVeigh and a phalanx of imitators, so far less successful.) We will have to keep our eyes open.	2002-11-10

These edifying works were organized by \\"subject\\" (God, Seafaring, Romance, Hope, Nature), and leaned heavily toward poems from prior centuries, or poems which exhibited a comforting folksiness, or wore uplifting morals on their sleeves.<br />There's a far larger public today which is actually prepared to read poems for pleasure, and Garrison Keillor has put together a poetic omnibus, also arranged by subject (I particularly like the group of poems on \\"Yellow\\" followed by the ones on \\"Snow\\"), which is otherwise quite the opposite of the old workhorses. Yes, prior centuries are represented, but the center of gravity lies among good modern poets, most of them still living, most of whom you never had a chance to read in school. They have been selected for both memorability and straightforward style.  There are often flashes of humor, and trendily obscure versifiers need not apply, but there's no lack of depth or sophistication. (Think Billy Collins, who is well represented here.) Those of us who already read a lot of poetry, and those of us who suffered with glazed eyes through opaque symbols in English class, will both find fresh pleasures, simple ones and subtle, in this treasury.<br />It's what a poetry anthology should be: a sampler, a taster's counter at the many-flavored ice cream shop of verse. You can find old friends and new ones, and learn who you want to explore in depth later on. And this anthology lays out a richer feast of new friends than any other I've encountered.<br />As a bonus, there's Keillor's bluntly opinionated preface, in which he trashes Marianne Moore in favor of Elizabeth Bishop, \\"Saint Sylvia\\" in favor of Anne Sexton, and T.S. Eliot on general principles. It was a hoot even though I disagreed with him on two out of three.	2002-10-28

The collapse of the old USSR put the seal of history on that simple truth. The cold war is over, and the good guys won.<br />We are already in the middle of the next war, and Lawrence Lessig is warning us (though he doesn't use exactly these terms) that the good guys are losing badly. We're losing because our entire legislative and judicial apparatus is too busy fighting the last war to notice the new one. The great issue for the 20th century was drawn along classic liberal/conservative lines: should allocation of scarce resources be placed under the control of government or of the market? The great issue for the 21st is: should abundant resources, which have traditionally been allocated to everyone, remain free from control - or should they be placed under the control of \\"the market\\"? [The scare quotes are mine, not Lessig's, since he places little emphasis on the fact that the entities gaining control are often not really the market at all, but a handful of corporations with enough monopolistic power to avoid effective market discipline.]<br />The advocates of control against freedom have effectively coopted the *language* of conservatism - \\"property\\" and \\"market\\" - in order to obscure that the issue is no longer one of government control versus market control, but of control versus freedom. A fair number of conservatives, like Judge Posner and Orrin Hatch, have seen through this ploy, but not enough to form any critical mass.<br />Lessig explores the historical and legal issues brilliantly, always with a view to the question: what mix of corporate controls and personal freedom will maximize creativity and innovation?  He examines how the original architecture of the Internet, and the original establishment of copyright and patent law, enforced a level playing field and encouraged innovation. Then, point for point, he exhibits the ways in which lobbies for entrenched industries, fearful of innovation, have gone aboutdismantling those encouragements. <br />He doesn't see those industries as \\"evil\\".  They are doing just what they are morally obliged to do - trying to maximize profits for their investors. The problem is the absence of any other voices speaking with equal volume for the public interest. The body of Internet and intellectual property law which has emerged over the last decade or so is almost universally designed to defend the old, and to restrain the new.  And it is the interests of \\"old\\" vs \\"new\\", of \\"controlled\\" vs \\"free\\", rather than of \\"government\\" vs \\"market\\", which are now at stake. If this revolutionary expansion of intellectual property rights and equally revolutionary concentration of power over media and communications are allowed to lock in, we stand in danger of losing our dynamism as a society.<br />Lessig offers no shortage of recommendations for future action to preserve our intellectual commons, and open up the field again for innovation. Again and again he thinks well outside the box, seeking balance, crafting proposals that combine the strengths of market and commons. Not all his ideas are going to pan out - but his most important idea is simply that we as a society need to *start thinking* about whether innovation is worth preserving, and how to preserve it.  And we need to start thinking fast.<br />There's a lot to absorb in the volume's few pages. To get a broader picture of the tenor of Lessig's ideas, I strongly recommend the earlier reviews by David Rogers and Alex Pang.	2002-10-27
US	52084271	R1Y00HVXJWS2YT	0618126988	619220705	The Silmarillion	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Why the elves are so sad	This six-star review assumes that you have read The Lord of the Rings.  If you haven't, go do that first, and then come back here.<br />Tolkien thought of the Silmarillion as his life's great work. He was right. Even though we have it only in a partial, posthumous form, he was right. Reading it is a very different kind of adventure from reading The Hobbit or Lord of the Rings. What is the difference? In Tolkien's own terms, both of those books are taken from the Red Book of Westmarch, which was written by hobbits. Like hobbits, their books were chatty, immediate, easy to get to know, \\"hasty.\\" The works in the Silmarillion, in contrast, are taken from the epic literature of the High Elves. Like genuine epic literature the world over before the novel was invented, the Silmarillion is telegraphic, panoramic, and (though only on a first reading, and only to a modern ear) loftily impersonal. And never hasty. To get the proper good of it, it should be read slowly, no faster than the pace of a singing bard.<br />Most modern readers find Malory's Morte D'Arthur almost impossible to read. That's not because it isn't a great, immortal story. It's because the habit of reading novels has coddled us, so that we want to be shown everything, rather than use our own imaginations to fill in the details in the huge canvas of story that Malory (or in the present case Tolkien) has constructed for us. The epics must be read actively to extract their gold. The Silmarillion, in this regard, is actually much more readable than Tolkien's premodern models, and I don't want to overstate its difficulty. It would be impossible to overstate its rewards.<br />What's difficult about the Silmarillion isn't that it's boring; it's that so very much happens in it. It relates primarily the history of the First Age of Middle Earth (the Silmarillion proper). But it begins with an account of the creation of the world (the most dense and difficult part; just take it slow and easy and keep plowing forward,the going gets smoother), and it also tells about the second age (when Aragorn's line was founded), and the third.  The entire three volumes of the Lord of the Rings get summarized in only five pages of this book. It is chock full of other stories that are just as worthy of expansion to their own thousand pages: all you have to add is imagination.<br />It's true that Tolkien was not a very great, perhaps not even a very good, writer. But his world has taken up deep residence in the minds and hearts of millions of people, because he was the twentieth century's greatest co-creator. The Lord of the Rings has thousands of imitators, but no equals.  What did it have that they don't have? Samwise could have told us: \\"It's elves, sir.\\" JRRT's epic novel showed the requisite triumph of good over massive evil, but from the beginning what held the reader was not the clash of battle or the exhilaration of victory, but the elegaic sense of a magical world doomed to pass away.<br />That elegaic magical sense belongs to the elves. What the Silmarillion does is to unfold in its full depth the source of the elven melancholy: the sorrow brought on by immortality, which is after all a kind of irreversibility. It's not too much of a spoiler to observe that the Silmarillion begins with a disastrous oath, and that it is the deathlessness of the elves which ensures the oath's curse will be deathless. If you were moved by the partings at the Grey Havens in Lord of the Rings, then the story of the ages-long unfolding of Feanor's oath will tear at your heart, and its intertwining with the jewel-perfect romance of Beren and Tinuviel will break it. <br />The same immortality theme is deepened and freighted with irony in the Akallabeth, the tragedy of the Second Age, in which Morgoth persuades the men of Numenor that human mortality is an injustice, rather than the gift the elves know it to be. Tolkien has single-handedly fashioned a vast tragic cycle as full of meaning and potential as the ones he knew from Greek and Nordic mythology. The elves' world is every bit as doom-haunted as the Norse, but as a devout Roman Catholic Tolkien deliberately left an uninhabited open space, nestled within the mystery of human mortality, inside which a thread of unspoken hope barely glistens. Its glow secretly alters the coloring of Middle Earth's twilight, and makes the Silmarillion unique among all the world's epic literature.<br />Go ahead, read it.	2002-10-26

But has its boiler run out of steam at last?<br />In his latest and by far his most ambitious work, Steven Pinker  tells us, in a lively but dispassionate voice of sweet reason, that the answer is yes. His demolition of cultural relativism may well make him a lot of enemies. He's touched on many of these same ideas before, but now he is spelling out the consequences - and the incompatibility of those consequences with the received wisdom of most of the last century.<br />His fundamental message is: Yes, Virginia, there is a human nature. People of all cultures are born with a host of inborn predispositions - to acquire language and music, to favor kin over strangers, to desire sex and to be ashamed of it, to value even trades and to punish cheaters, and dozens more. Our common nature springs from our common biology; it is not very malleable, and it is not \\"socially constructed.\\" Cultural diversity is marvelous, but it is all a variation on an immutable theme; and there have never been any human cultures free of war, of greed, or of prescribed gender roles. (Any more than there have ever been any free of conflict resolution techniques, altruism, and shared parenting.)<br />His secondary theme is that the differences between people, so much smaller than what we have in common, are also primarily biologically determined. A juggernaut of data has finally put the nature/nurture controversy to rest, at least from a scientific standpoint, and the final score is pretty much nature one, nurture zero. Fifty to seventy percent of the variation between individuals - in intelligence, in personality, in political leanings, or just about any other mental character you care to name - derives from the genes; zero to ten percent derives from the home environment; and the mysterious remainder is due to chance or to non-parental environment.<br />We have been conditioned in recent decades to think of both these contentions as shocking. They violate two precepts Pinker designates the \\"sacred doctrines in modern intellectual life.\\" He calls them The Blank Slate (with a nod to Locke), and The Noble Savage (with a nod to Rousseau.) The first holds that ideas, likes, dislikes, and personalities are all the result of what Locke called \\"sense impressions\\", that is, they are all imprinted on us by our environments. The second is a little more modest, but forms the seductive core of the first, because we'd all like it to be true. It holds that all our unpleasant ideas, likes, dislikes, and neurotic tics are forced by a wicked society upon an infant slate which is, if not blank, devoid of all blemish. <br />Pinker spends the first hundred pages tracing the lineage of these sacred doctrines (and of a third, neither so carefully examined nor so carefully defined, which he calls The Ghost in the Machine. The philosophers who originated the phrase were trying to deny the reality of consciousness, but what Pinker is trying to deny turns out to be narrower - essentially, the doctrine that whatever biological nature we may have can be overriden by a soul or self with a free will independent of biology.) He explores what has made the three doctrines attractive to all of us, but especially to the academic left, and the deep fears which have made it taboo, as E.O. Wilson found to his cost, to contradict them.<br />He then explains, carefully and (at least with respect to the first two) convincingly, why the fears in question are groundless - and why we should rather fear the ill effects of suppressing this new knowledge about human nature. <br />Finally, he takes up in a series of individual chapters several of the hot-button political and social issues that are affected by the existence of an objective human nature, and by the largely genetic basis of most human differences: the source of the left/right divide in politics, the root causes of violence, what objective gender differences (and the biological influences bearing on rape) do and do not mean for public policy, the coming irrelevance of the child-rearing advice industry, and a rather curmudgeonly take on what he sees as the well-deserved unpopularity of avant-garde art.<br />The child-rearing chapter is particularly eye-opening, while the violence chapter offers some fairly fresh ideas, not so much on its origins, which are the same for us as for chimpanzees, but on the variables affecting its expression. Also notable is Pinker's calm, complete demolition, on strictly biological grounds, of the notion that an embryo is \\"ensouled\\" at the moment of conception. (Perhaps still more notable, and indicative of the book's even tenor for all its polemics, is his refusal to draw any pro-choice conclusion from that.)<br />It's a joy to see some of Pinker's more irrational targets, from die-hard Marxism to the rejection of science itself by \\"critical theory\\" to the bromide that rape isn't \\"about\\" sexual desire, skewered with such swift and classical neatness. The longer lasting pleasures will come from a leisurely unpacking and sifting of all his positive conjectures, conclusions, and insights. It's a book you can zip through in a couple of nights, or return to for thought-fodder for years.	2002-10-20

Much of what's in here has been done before, and done better, by people like Martin Gardner and Carl Sagan. The specific debunkings can't go into much detail, because Shermer covers so much territory. For example, Pennock's \\"Tower of Babel\\" provides a far deeper understanding of the makeup and motivations of the Creationist movement. But there's enough that's fresh to make it a worthwhile read: material on the Ayn Rand cult (and why it qualifies objectively as a cult), personal war stories about what it's like to battle the weirdmongers on weird-friendly media turf, and things psychologists have learned about traits that correlate with paranormal beliefs. And as the founder and editor of Skeptic magazine, the author knows his territory.<br />Shermer draws useful parallels between creation science and Holocaust denial. I hadn't noticed the tactic both share, which is a generally useful one for anybody who wants a protective seal against reality: the creationists demand \\"just one fossil\\" which is incontrovertibly transitional, and the revisionists demand \\"just one document\\" which incontrovertibly spells out the plan for Hitler's Final Solution. This \\"one knockdown argument or nothing\\" strategy permits them to cultivate tunnel vision, and to ignore the *accumulated* weight of evidence, which is how truth is ordinarily determined in truly rational history, truly rational science, and for that matter in common sense. <br />You wouldn't expect that Shermer could come up with a definitive answer for the title's question, and he doesn't. But he does make a serious attempt, and shows as much interest in understanding the true believers as he shows in exploding their beliefs. He's fighting the good skeptical fight, fighting it without compromise, but doing it with more gentleness and respect toward his opponents than one usually finds in this genre of literature. (Though I was surprised at how hard he came down on Frank Tipler. Tipler's \\"Physicsof Immortality\\" incorporates a powerful element of wishful thinking, but it's not in conflict with science, much less in full fugue from reality like the rest of Shermer's subjects.)<br />If you've already read Gardner and Sagan, and want more good debunking entertainment in the same line; or if you'd enjoy meditating on why people do believe weird things, but aren't expecting a final answer; or if you do engage in skirmishes with true believers yourself often enough to be collecting a short shelf of useful references, you'll find Shermer a genial companion, and this book (and its extensive bibliography) well worth your time.

US	52084271	R1VZDL1UXR8T9S	0670031518	879167194	The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature	Books	4	52	60	N	N	Because we're all relatives, it's not all relative	In his latest, and by far his most ambitious, work, Steven Pinker speaks in a wide-ranging, lively but dispassionate voice of sweet reason. It may well make him a lot of enemies. He's touched on many of these same ideas before, but now he is spelling out the consequences - and the incompatibility of those consequences with the received wisdom of most of the last century.<br />His fundamental message is: Yes, Virginia, there is a human nature. People of all cultures are born with a host of inborn predispositions - to acquire language and music, to favor kin over strangers, to want sex and to be ashamed of it, to value even trades and to punish cheaters, and dozens more. Our common nature springs from our common biology; it is not very malleable, and it is not \\"socially constructed.\\" Cultural diversity is marvelous, but it is all a variation on an immutable theme; and there have never been any human cultures free of war, of greed, or of prescribed gender roles. (Nor any free of conflict resolution techniques, altruism, and shared parenting.)<br />His secondary theme is that the differences between people, so much smaller than what we have in common, are also primarily biologically determined. A juggernaut of data has finally put the nature/nurture controversy to rest, at least from a scientific standpoint, and the final score is pretty much nature one, nurture zero. Fifty to seventy percent of the variation between individuals - in intelligence, in personality, in political leanings, or just about any other mental character you care to name - derives from the genes; zero to ten percent derives from the home environment; and the mysterious remainder is due to chance or to non-parental environment.<br />We have been conditioned in recent decades to think of both these contentions as shocking. They violate two precepts Pinker designates the \\"sacred doctrines in modern intellectual life.\\" He calls them The Blank Slate (with a nod to Locke), and The Noble Savage (with a nod to Rousseau.) The first holds that ideas, likes, dislikes, and personalities are all the result of what Locke called \\"sense impressions\\", that is, they are all imprinted on us by our environments. The second is a little more modest, but forms the seductive core of the first, because we'd all like it to be true. It holds that all our unpleasant ideas, likes, dislikes, and neurotic tics are forced by a wicked society upon an infant slate which is, if not blank, devoid of all blemish. <br />Pinker spends the first hundred pages tracing the lineage of these sacred doctrines (and of a third, less carefully examined, which he calls The Ghost in the Machine - essentially, the doctrine that whatever biological nature we may have can be overriden by a soul or self with a free will independent of biology.) He explores what has made them attractive to all of us, but especially to the academic left, and the deep fears which have made it taboo, as E.O. Wilson found to his cost, to contradict them.<br />He then explains, carefully and (at least with respect to the first two) convincingly, why the fears in question are groundless - and why we should rather fear the ill effects of suppressing this new knowledge about human nature. <br />Finally, he takes up in a series of individual chapters several of the hot-button political and social issues that are affected by the existence of an objective human nature, and by the largely genetic basis of most human differences: the basis for the left/right divide in politics, the root causes of violence, what objective gender differences (and the biological influences bearing on rape) do and do not mean for public policy, the coming irrelevance of the child-rearing advice industry, and a rather curmudgeonly take on what he sees as the well-deserved unpopularity of avant-garde art.<br />The child-rearing chapter is particularly eye-opening, and the violence chapter offers some very fresh ideas, not so much on its origins, which are the samefor us as for chimpanzees, but on the variables affecting its expression. Also notable is Pinker's calm, complete demolition, on strictly biological grounds, of the notion that an embryo is \\"ensouled\\" at the moment of conception. (Perhaps still more notable, and indicative of the book's even tenor for all its polemics, is his refusal to draw any pro-choice conclusion from that.)<br />It's a joy to see some of Pinker's more irrational targets, from die-hard Marxism to the rejection of science itself by \\"critical theory\\" to the bromide that rape isn't \\"about\\" sexual desire, skewered with such swift and classical neatness. The longer lasting pleasures will come from a leisurely unpacking and sifting of all his positive conjectures, conclusions, and insights. It's a book you can zip through in a couple of nights, or return to for thought-fodder for years.	2002-10-07
US	52084271	R2AHK0PUJK8UA7	0375410341	383727435	House of Leaves: A Novel	Books	4	12	15	N	N	Center everywhere, circumference nowhere	Ignore the four stars.  I don't know how to rate this book. I finished it and put it down a week ago, and it still hasn't put me down. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I can't say I was spooked by the spooky parts, but it keeps echoing and reverberating and suggesting new ways of looking at itself. A single review can hardly scratch the surface.<br />Ostensibly it's \\"about\\" an orphaned California slacker named Johnny Truant, who discovers a trunkful of notes in the apartment of a blind, ominously dead recluse named Zampano. The notes are for a commentary on a film documentary called The Navidson Record. The documentary records photojournalist Will Navidson's attempts to explore an expandable, collapsible, freakily infinite hallway that appears in his suburban Virginia home. Navidson's *h*o*u*s*e* (read that as blue text, please) is a heart of darkness, terrifying in its otherness, its vast inexplicability, its emptiness, its death-in-life.  <br />Truant soon discovers that the *h*o*u*s*e*, the documentary, and Navidson himself don't seem to exist in (his and the novel's) real world. But as he obsesses over the notes and the horrors they examine, he finds his own reality, or his own mind, disintegrating into ash. His breakdown leads to a nightmarish and quite likely spurious denoument, and finally to the publication by Johnny's faceless editors of the book before us.<br />All this, including the details of Navidson's polar expeditions into inner space, reads along quite naturally, even though the book sends you hopping from text to footnote to spiralling footnotes nested several levels deep, and through typographic games that sometimes make the reader feel like he's attending a taffy pull, starring as the taffy. I often found these tricks irritating or boring, but that didn't mean I was ever capable of laying the book aside.<br />If the prose style - actually the two prose styles, the self dramatizing, sometimes slangy and sometimes lushly lyrical, voice of JohhnyTruant, and the dryly academic semiotician's voice of Zampano, with its dryly sardonic footnotes mocking every convention of \\"critical theory\\" - is nothing to write home about, it's always appropriate to the character delivering it. The massive display of erudition (Danielewski has not merely read Heidegger and Derrida, he has them thoroughly scoped out, and builds their ideas deeply into the warp and woof of his novel) is bound to strike some readers as dreary showing off. But he doesn't just drop names. He makes use of them: he makes his Latin tags and mythological allusions and postmodern cliches bounce off one another, enlarging alarmingly the mental space inhabited by the text. There must be a hundred different ways to think about Danielewski's artifact, a hundred paths into the labyrinth, and at every turning he generously sets up signposts to help willing readers get lost among them.<br />To follow one main clew: \\"*H*o*u*s*e* of Leaves\\" is a book about text, and how text and reality construct one another. The climax of each of the two main stories (and it just may take many readings to figure out how many other stories are camouflaged within them) involves an act of book burning. At the very center of Navidson's life is a still photo, one which won him a Pulitzer Prize - and though Navidson is fictional, the photo and its Pulitzer are real. At the center of Truant's obsessions is a mental movie of the moment a labyrinth of scars was traced across his chest and arms, making a text of his body. So notes of anonymous \\"editors\\" wrap around Truant's notes, which wrap around Zampano's notes, which wrap around Zampano's text, which wraps around Navidson's documentary, which wraps around a devastating photograph that really exists in the real reader's world - which wraps around the book. Where in the world or out of it is the center of this elaborate onion?<br />At one point in the documentary, Navidson speculates that the *h*o*u*s*e* is God. Danielewski isn't explicit, but that offhand remark is probably meant to call to mind the classic image of God in American literature, the fearful blankness, the whiteness, of Ahab's whale. Nicolas of Cusa once defined God as \\"a circle whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere.\\" In this volume, Danielewski has attempted to construct a circularly layered piece of literature which meets those specifications. And I can't swear that he hasn't succeeded. <br />Once you've followed the twists and turns of all the unheimlich maneuvers in \\"*H*o*u*s*e* of Leaves\\", where will you come out? Probably not where I did. As a work of literature, it may be worth anything from two stars to six. But as a work of echoing acoustic architecture, I'd have to say it's without parallel.	2002-09-30
US	52084271	R1ZQ3S4D2YFV9U	0743211375	124087136	From a Buick 8	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A peephole into the Other	If, as King has declared, this will be his last published novel (a declaration to which the response of his fans is bound to be, \\"Come on, Stephen, tell us another one!\\"), then he is going out on a pretty high note. Not with one of his half-dozen classics, but with a memorable and satisfying finish.    In his book length study of horror fiction, _Danse Macabre_, King wrote that he wanted to instill horror in his readers, and if he couldn't manage that, he'd go for terror, and if he couldn't manage that, he'd try for shock, and if he couldn't manage that, he'd settle for grossing them out. In _From a Buick 8_, he pulls out each of those stops at one point or another. But this time out, true horror occupies the story's center: the absolutely other, the absolutely alien, the sense of being confronted with the indescribable. Somehow the book's wise and weary cops manage to communicate the author's conviction that in the final analysis, all special effects and spooky stories aside, that's what ordinary life has always confronted us with.      The book is nothing like _Christine_. If King is repeating himself this time (and he isn't), what he's repeating is the marvelous novelette \\"The Mist\\". In that story, the Other surrounded the world and closed in on it. In this one, our own world surrounds a pinpoint of the uncanny: the Buick that's not a Buick in the state troopers' Shed B.    The unBuick is only a peephole into the Other, but a peephole is all that's required to rip apart the scaffolding of reality. The troop's mascot, Mister Dillon, whimpers in fear when the peephole periodically widens, yet scratches to get into its shed. The Buick is demonic, but whatever is demonic, as Rudolf Otto taught us, is also \\"holy\\" - it induces not just a mysterium tremendum but also a mysterium fascinans. And the troopers, in their varying degrees, experience both of the effects that Mr. Dillon feels.    Entwined with the horror story is an appreciative study of life in a rural Staties' barracks, of the matter-of-fact heroism of the men who stand in the thin grey line, shielding John Q Public from all the disruptions of his comfortable order that he would rather not know about, be they alien or earthly. It would have all the virtues of a solid police procedural, if only any of the police procedures applied. But in the case of the car with the crocodile smile, none of them do.	2002-09-27
US	52084271	RDQRM4L534LV6	0451202503	251893357	The Songcatcher	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Good read, but not the best intro to McCrumb	McCrumb's newest paperback is a ramblin' book. Its chapters form a mountain switchback. The odd chapters tell an episodic story set in the present, about rising country singer Lark McCourry , her difficult father, and her attempt to track down an old ballad about a graveyard and a rowan stave, of which she can remember only the one-line chorus: \\"And when she comes back, she will be changed-oh.\\" The even chapters trace the progress of the song from Scotland in the mid-1700s to the present, through a long line of Lark's ancestors (each of whom, as it happens, is one of Sharyn McCrumb's real ancestors.)<br />\\"The Songcatcher\\" affords many small pleasures and no sweeping ones. There's the local southern Appalachian color, and McCrumb's evident pride in it, particularly the constant sprinkling of unexpected hill country expressions (I liked \\"poor as Job's turkey\\", and I am not likely soon to forget the significance of Matthew 23:25). There are numerous interesting characters, though I felt only Malcolm McCourry, the founder of the line, was fully drawn and rounded. The ballad itself, which McCrumb wrote for the book, is as haunting and authentically folkwise as anything in Childe, and I wish the music came with it. What seemed to be missing was any deep passion, or any strong narrative drive. I was always happy to be reading along, but never dying to know what would happen next.<br />For members of McCrumb's extended family, this volume is bound to seem a treasure trove. The same may be true for those who have ever been bitten (as I never have) by the genealogy bug; and for those who have read enough of her previous novels to feel, as one might easily come to feel, that the author is an old friend. For the rest of us, this is a pleasant enough read, but probably the wrong place to start in on her works. Several of her previous Appalachian sagas have all the strengths of this one, and none of its weaknesses, and stand better on their own. The earlier books will also introduce you to a number of the local constabulary and eccentrics, with whose lives and habits this volume seems to assume you are already familiar.	2002-09-20

It's fundamentally very sweet natured, and with the exception of one chapter, pretty much useless as erotica, but it does get anatomically explicit before it's through. Genitalia do figure in this tale. 'Nuff said.)<br />In Jeffrey Eugenides' second book, we get two satisfying, and very different, short novels masquerading as one long one. Or, in keeping with its heroine's existence one precarious jump ahead of the freak show recruiters, you could think of this as Siamese twin novels, joined at the heart. Each fraternal (sororal?) twin is in its own way a sure-fire crowd pleaser, so even though I only rate the book at three and a half stars, I'm sure it will enjoy a long and comfortable ride on the best seller list. (The rating rounds up because I'm always grateful to get chapter titles, especially colorful ones. And as often as it forced me to wince in sympathy, it got me to laugh.)<br />In what may be a nod to Tristram Shandy, the book's main character, the believable, bright young hermaphrodite Calliope (eventually to be Cal) is introduced on the first page, and then doesn't get around to being born til nearly halfway through. <br />Calliope was the muse of epic poetry, and the pre-birth novel is the epic story of the Greek-American experience, as particularized in Callie's \\"yia yia\\", her silkworm spinning paternal grandmother Desdemona. The story of her escape from the Turkish torching of Smyrna, her very unorthodox marriage, her extended (and simultaneously telescoped) family in Detroit, her sex-divining spoon, and most deliciously of her adoption by a very American and very un-Greek religion - has the constant flavor of magical realism, without ever departing from strict plausibility. Eugenides' bemusement at and affection for all the chunks of Greekness that never quite melted down in the Melting Pot are evident throughout. We've seen this sort of ethnic homage often enough before, but he does it as well as any, and it's both touching and fun.<br />The post-birth novel has a completely different flavor. Hermaphroditism would seem like a natural magical-realist theme, playing off mythical archetypes as it does. But Callie is not going to lie down and play archetype for anyone. Cal is aware, certainly, of the echos and literary associations, and appreciates the irony of having landed the role of Teresias in her middle school production of Antigone. But he is also aware, as he recollects at 41 his normal American girlhood, and then leads us through the large agonies and small ecstasies of the minefield of his adolescence, that he has to come to grips with the ordinariness of his in-between condition, a condition that for all its relative rarity is shared in one form or another by millions of people. And even more than the obvious titillation value of the theme, it's this feet-on-the-ground, keenly reportorial nature of  Cal's memoir, plus the way Callie's good nature and good humor gleam through the acute distress, that makes this second novel-within-the-novel as surefire a crowd pleaser as the first one.	2002-09-16

This book is bolder and more stimulating than Kauffman's seminal &quot;Origins of Order&quot;, which is saying a great deal. And it's easier to read, which isn't saying very much. <br />It's a nightlong fireworks display of ideas, but as you'd expect, the core idea is still that of &quot;order for free.&quot;  Kauffman argues that the second law of thermodynamics, once its formulation and its assumptions are carefully critiqued, does not imply that the universe is destined to exhibit more and more disorder. On the contrary, the central tendency of the universe is toward ever ramifying complexity. Complex systems, and living things in particular, act as so many Maxwell's Demons, identifying sources - often surprising and unpredictable sources - of exploitable energy, and harnessing them to drive work cycles for their own benefit. And for their own further complexification.<br />The paradigmatic setting for the argument, which he then explores in a variety of other settings, is a soup of organic chemicals. The number of additional chemicals that can be synthesized in one step, Kauffman argues persuasively, grows exponentially as the number of input chemicals grows linearly. Thus there is an explosion of &quot;the adjacent possible&quot;.  The same is true of the number of potential catalytic relationships among the chemical species in the soup. Simple considerations of probability make it all but inevitable that sets of self-sustaining catalytic processes will arise spontaneously. And if so, can life itself be such a leap?<br />His arguments are qualitative, but in a hard-edged way. The worldview - or cosmos view - that emerges is a stupefyingly optimistic one. This is fuzzy thinking with real hair on its chest.<br />Kauffman acknowledges from the get-go that what he's putting into this volume isn't science. It's &quot;protoscience&quot;, intuitions, educated guesses and speculations that may well turn into some spectacular science indeed. The reigning dean of complexity studies is here thinking out loud, carefully and at length, and sometimes out of even his own considerable depth, about the most fundamental questions facing biology, economics, and (perhaps) physics as the new millenium begins. He seems not to have reached a wide readership, but neither did another cross-disciplinary work of similar speculative boldness and depth, Schroedinger's &quot;What Is Life?&quot; Like that small gem, this will be discovered and rediscovered as a classic over the decades to come.	2002-09-12

Gaiman's hero Shadow, about to be released from a long stay in the hoosegow with nothing to recommend him to the world outside but a facility with coin tricks, is easy to like but oddly passive. He finds himself a foot soldier in a war between the old gods of America (divine pagan immigrants from every culture, subsisting like down-at-heels landed gentry on declining scraps of belief) and the new gods of secular technoculture. The details are amusing, well researched, and sufficiently surprising to keep the pages turning briskly.<br />The thematic tag line is, \\"This is a bad land for gods.\\"  It's a peculiar thing to say about America, which not only has been, throughout its history, one of the most enthusiastically religious countries on earth, but which has also extended by far the warmest welcome to the widest variety of gods. What does strike a genuinely American note, and partially justifies the title, is the spaciousness of its unfolding. Shadow spends most of the novel on the open road, on one mysterious errand after another.<br />Gaiman is farming ground a bit like what Tim Powers has been working the last few decades: fantasies that traverse real world landscapes, and expose high-stakes occult conflicts roiling under  their skins. Gaiman is better at smooth pacing and dialog; but Powers is better at conveying the electric crackle when a serious conspiracy theory blows in, and at filling in the shadows at the narrative's edge with something more like myth and less like whimsy. Afficianados of Powers will probably enjoy this book; those who like this one should give Powers a try. Good starting points are \\"The Anubis Gate\\" or \\"Last Call.\\"	2002-09-01

Their commentary is up to the minute, their narrative sufficiently orderly to help keep straight (for me, for the first time) the succession of Middle Eastern potentates who impacted Israel's fortunes, as well as the succession of fashionable theories over the last century within the discipline of biblical archaeology.<br />Aside from their general clarity, what I liked best was their clarity in distinguishing the facts (pottery style X found in layer Y of site C) from the generally accepted interpretations, and from their own interpretations. I liked that, because these excellent tour guides are carrying a certain amount of their own baggage, much of which I found myself taking exception to. They are not minimalists: They accept the historicity of the Davidic monarchy, they reject the often voiced view that the Hebrew Bible was mostly composed after the Babylonian exile, and they are open to the view that much of the Pentateuch draws on early iron age traditions. Nor, certainly, are they maximalists: they regard the Exodus story as purely legendary, and their central original thesis is that although there was a Davidic monarchy in Judah, there never was a &quot;united kingdom&quot;. They believe David and Solomon ruled only over Judah, and had no influence over the more prosperous and advanced northern kingdom of Israel.<br />I found a number of their arguments persuasive: for a distinct Isrealite culture in the northern highlands, dating from the early Iron Age (based on the absence of pig bones there); for a time of composition of the Deuteronomic History (the books from Joshua through II Kings) during or shortly after the time of Judah's King Josiah in the late seventh century, after Assyria destroyed the Northern Kingdom; and against the view that Judah in the time of David enjoyed significant military or economic power.  On the other hand, their leap from &quot;the north was more materially advanced than Judah&quot; to &quot;Judah could never have exercised political control over the north&quot; seems unjustified; a charismatic leader doesn't need opulence to command allegiance - and in small societies, his plain living can even add to his authority.<br />If the book has an agenda, it is certainly not debunking the Bible. Perhaps there is a political agenda of a more narrowly Israeli kind: if there never was a &quot;united kingdom&quot; before Josiah, there never was an &quot;aretz Israel&quot;, from which it would follow that there would be no religious betrayal involved in a treaty ceding the West Bank back to the Palestinians.<br />But whatever their motives, F&amp;S present their case straightforwardly, clearly, and concisely, and along the way they dish out what is, for such a short book, a surprising quantity of hard information that will be useful to anyone interested in the issues they raise, from maximalists to minimalists to those of us in the middle.	2002-08-30

Steven Jay Gould, was one of our deepest, most creative and most careful evolutionary thinkers, here delivered his magnum opus, and it inevitably rates five stars for importance. And, yes, those essays from Natural History have given you a lot of pleasure over the years. But, good Lord, look at the heft of the thing! Would you perhaps be better advised to give it a pass?<br /> The answer is no, not if you really care about where evolutionary theory is going during the next forty years. It's true that it's longer than it had to be, and many of its luxuriating sentences are more like a bush than a tree. A good editor could have helped Gould bring it down to 1000 pages or so, and improved it thereby. But the main reason it's such a doorstop is because it's busy opening so many doors. There's far too much to respond to and critique in a review of Amazon length. So what I'm going to do is provide cheats and spoilers: I'll say what you can skip or skim without missing gist or cream, and then give a *very* brief precis of that gist.<br /> THE QUICK TOUR.<BR>Chapter One. <BR> Chiefly a summary of what's to come, a summary so dense and abstract that it's likely to convince many readers, falsely, that the book is going to be unreadable. (In the paperback edition, please add a brief glossary!) Scoop up the material on Scilla's coral (pp. 12-24) and save the rest for later. <br />Part I. <BR> The next 6 chapters survey the history of evolutionary thought, with a focus on old controversies Gould believes need re-opening, albeit at a higher level. As influential as Gould's been as a scientist, his real genius is for history of ideas, and these chapters are a richly rewarding read, very reminiscent of his Natural History essays in tone. But all that's needed to follow the main thread of the book's arguments are chapter 2 (an illuminating tour of Darwin's \\"Origin\\"), some talk about how Darwin dealt with the generation of diversity (pp. 224-229), the metaphor of Galton's polyhedron(pp. 342-351), and, to show what Gould is contrasting himself with, the exposition of how the \\"Modern Synthesis\\" of the 40s and 50s froze Darwinism into a rigid form (all of chapter 7).<br />Part II<BR> Little is skippable. The last 50 pages of chapter seven, the punk eek centerpiece, discuss the abuses poured on punk eek by nefarious parties like Dawkins and creationists. It's juicy, but peripheral. The passages on D'Arcy Thompson (pp. 1182-1208) and on mass extinctions (all of chapter 12) are necessary to the organizational scheme, but not necessary to the logic or substance of Gould's \\"one long argument.\\"<br /> WHAT IT HAS TO SAY...<br /> Darwin gave us a slam-dunk proof of the fact of common descent, which no scientist but the aging Aggasiz has seriously disputed since. But initially his causal theory of how it happened drew a great deal of fire. For the first 60 years after the Origin, the woods were crawling with evolutionists, some of them naturalists at the top of their game, who wanted to replace natural selection with some other mechanism. Darwin triumphed, Gould tells us, because his basic idea was right. But now the time has come for major upheaval and revision, because several of his major secondary commitments were mistaken.<br /> What Gould says Darwin got right: Selection acting on ordinary variation, which is in some sense random, is what produces almost all evolutionary change.<br /> Mistaken secondary commitment 1: Selection acts only on individual organisms. Gould argues that selection acts up and down the hierarchy - on genes, cells, organisms, demes, species, and clades, but (other than organisms) especially on species, because species have the sort of cohesion that makes for good selective \\"individuals.\\"<br /> Mistaken secondary commitment 2: The environment shapes almost all change, by selective pressures which mold adaptations. Gould points out that Darwin's argument for this thesis rests on the assumption that variation is \\"isotopic\\" - equally likely in all directions - and \\"imperceptible.\\" He argues that recent genetic discoveries prove the contrary: deep homologies across phyla make certain major inventions such as optical lenses more likely than others, and small genetic changes in homeobox and other regulatory genes can lead to very perceptible variations, in preferred directions. And consequently, the direction of change is shaped as much by internal availabilities - creating \\"exaptations\\" - as by external selective pressures creating adaptations.<br /> Mistaken secondary commitment 3: Selective pressure is always producing small changes, and these are always accumulating in the direction of greater fitness; simple extrapolation from them can account for the whole panoply of living things. Gould argues that (1) selective pressures fail to produce change most of the time, the phenomenon of stasis first highlighted as part of punctuated equilibrium, and (2) the changes don't accumulate. Rather, among organisms within a species, they mostly fluctuate back and forth, unless a change gets locked in by being isolated in a new species. And any trends across species are the result of selection at the species or clade levels, a kind of selection with its own emergent mechanisms not extrapolatable from Darwinian natural selection among organisms.<br /> Is all this really all that revolutionary? Gould clearly documents how vehemently each item in the programme he outlines was denied and resisted by the old guard of the Modern Synthesis; if he seems to be making a mountain out of a molehill, it's mostly because we've grown so used to offenses against pure Darwinism in the last twenty-five years. Certainly the positions he takes open myriad fruitful lines of future inquiry. And that's really what he's after. In his \\"segue\\" between parts one and two, he notes that the time is not now ripe for still another New Synthesis; we don't know enough yet. He says that he intends this book as an antithesis to the ModernSynthesis, undoubtedly overstated and overreaching, but likely to spur the birth of the next synthesis in its own good Hegelian time. Despite (and perhaps even because) of the numerous criticisms and counter-arguments that I found myself penciling into the margins of Gould's \\"Structure\\", I think his tome will admirably serve that prodding purpose.	2002-08-26

And evolutionary biologist Olivia Judson is here, in the person of Dr. Tatiana, agony columnist to the biosphere, to print their epistolary pleas for amatory advice, and to answer all their questions - and ours. Let her count the ways.<br />Judson's humor is not quite as sparkling as she takes it to be. But that's all right, because she doesn't lay it on too thick, being too eager to get down to what she really likes to talk about: the dazzling variety of behaviors, strategems, perils and contortions to be found in the universal mating game. And let's not kid ourselves, that's what her readers also really want to get down to.<br />From the Asian stick insect who stretches one copulation out for months at a time, to the fruit fly only five percent as long as one of his own sperm, to the slime mold with its 500 sexes, 13 of which have to get together to make a little baby slime mold, Dr. Tatiana covers the beat and covers the bases. There's a fresh astonishment on every page. They're delivered in bite-sized two or three paged morsels, which explains why Nature magazine's generally favorable review suggests this as the perfect book for your family sittin-and-thinkin room.<br />The fun, like the devil, is in the details, and there's a cornucopia of details, ranging across a hundred species or more. But the good Doctor manages along the way to touch on plenty of possible generalizations, evolutionary conundrums and controversies and imponderables. For example, she thoroughly debunks the one dogma about animal sexuality that I was brought up on: Bateman's principle that sex is more costly to females, making males more promiscuous. It turns out that, for most species, the reverse is true. Judson considers what determines an individual's gender (it's not always in the chromosomes); just how much sex a species needs to stay healthy; and how the whole crazy business of mating ever could have been invented.<br />But it's never more than a page or a half a page of pondering, before we're back at the zoo, gawking at another juicily indecent display, another cross between Ripley's believe it or not and Sally Jesse Raphael. I defy anyone not to have fun with this book, and not to come away with both more amazement at and more understanding of the natural world.	2002-08-14

Last time around, it was Stephenson's \\"Snow Crash.\\"  Three decades earlier, though some might quibble with the genre, it was Pynchon's \\"V.\\"  This go-round, it's Mieville's \\"Perdido Street Station.\\"<br />Readers ignore these writers at their peril. Comparisons to other writers in such cases are inept and all but pointless. No, there's nothing of Dickens here except the welter of placenames tinged with Victorian London. There's nothing of Peake except the way a rotting labyrinth of mountainous slapdash architecture becomes a major character. Like Peake, Mieville is a visionary, who paints his scenes indelibly on the eye in all their riotous profusion; and you could come closer to describing him by comparing him to painters.  Specifically, I'd liken him to a chimerical union of Hogarth and Hieronymus Bosch.<br />His city of New Crobuzon is gigantic and detailed. Its inhabitants, human and non-human, flood into it from the far larger world of Bas-Lag, the shape of which is only hinted at. The action builds slowly, but the strangeness strikes instantly, as we are introduced to the rogue scientist-for-hire Isaac Dan der Grimnebulin, and to his lover Lin, an artist in exile from the hive society of the khepri, a race of beings with human bodies and insect \\"headbodies\\". Each of them embarks on the most challenging and lucrative commission of their careers. For Lin, it is sculpting an image of New Crobuzon's most powerful crime boss, whose polymorphic, polypoid body type harks back to Yog Sothoth, and whose mind is rather less pretty than that. For Isaac, the client is a mutilated Garuda, an outcast from a desert society of winged beings, whose criminal offense is not translatable into human terms, and the scientist's object is to restore his power of flight.<br />Expect no standard, straightforward struggle between good and evil here, with a clear-cut victory for the forces of the right. This isn't that kind of fantasy. Mieville's human sympathy for his characters runs deep, but the world they live in is one of unsalvageable moral anarchy. A vicious totalitarian pseudo-democracy runs the city state. A thriving but wary commerce runs relations between the various sentient races. Heroism and survival are not often on speaking terms, and Mieville's own flawed heros sometimes choose to survive. It can be hard to blame them, and hard to excuse them. And it's hard to know which, if either, Mieville wants us to do. All of which makes for a tale as unsettling as it is compelling.<br />For all its science-fiction trappings (cyborgs and AI constructs and critters that feel a little more like aliens than like mythological beasts), the book doesn't work as sci-fi. The rules of the game aren't spelled out well enough, and it's not clear that Mieville would know how to spell them out. (For example, \\"crisis energy\\" seems to be available to perform some tasks and not available to perform others, with no discernible rhyme or reason.)  But that's okay.  The novel shows signs of not being thoroughly thought through; but it is thoroughly imagined through, and thoroughly felt through. So as fantasy it succeeds brilliantly. It will grip your imagination, and leave upon it claw marks that will not go away.	2002-08-05
US	52084271	RUOSUMSMT05X5	0738206679	117060972	Linked: The New Science of Networks	Books	5	10	12	N	N	How the real world hooks up	Mathematicians have been studying and modelling networks for nearly three centuries, ever since Gauss puzzled out the arrangement of bridges in Koenigsberg. By half a century ago, there was a vast literature of tens of thousands of papers on what had come to be called \\"graph theory.\\"<br />The big surprise is that no one ever tried to model the growth of networks, or to compare the models with large, spontaneously occurring networks in the real world, until the late 1990s. Barabasi was in on the ground floor of those fledgling efforts, and luckily for all of us to whom real world networks matter (nets of business associates, of friends, of interlocking corporate boards, of Internet nodes, web links, power grids, and half a dozen other major examples to be found here), he happens to have a great gift for clear, lively explanation.<br />Barabasi's style is *crisp*: it crackles with the excitement he feels for this exploding field of study; there's enough real substance for us techies to get our teeth into (rather than skipping the few formulas, he sequesters them in footnotes); he waters down nothing, and still makes everything seem simple.  (Partly this is because the subject *is* relatively simple. It's been built from the ground up in just the last few years, so understanding it doesn't require understanding a lot of previously built technical machinery.)<br />It turns out that all the very different real world networks I listed above have, allowing for a certain modicum of randomness, the same life histories, the same adult form, and a penchant for obeying the same laws.<br />First, all of them are \\"small worlds.\\"  The average number of \\"degrees of separation\\" for the friendship web in the U.S. is clearly less than 6.  The maximum number of links separating two of the 800 million public web pages around in 1998 was under 19. The average distance between any two stars in the Kevin Bacon game is less than 4. And so on.<br />Second, the links aren't randomly distributed at all. There's a \\"the rich get richer\\" phenomenon, in which early members of the network acquire more links, and nodes with more links are more likely to acquire new ones.  Count and plot the number of links, and you'll get nothing like the familiar old bell curve. Instead it looks like what's called a \\"power law\\": the lion's share of links go to a handful of power nodes, which Barabasi calls \\"hubs\\" - think Amazon and Google. Most of the rest go to a larger, but still very small, collection of nodes. And so on, down to the vast array of the Johnny-come-latelies and also rans, with their two or three connections to the network.<br />A critical question these days is: how robust are these spontaneously grown networks?  How resistant are they to failure? And the reassuring answer is, that even when you remove an enormous number of nodes, a quarter or a third of them, nets like these stay up and working and connected. The less reassuring answer is, that all these networks are highly vulnerable to deliberate attacks. If saboteurs adopt a take-out-the-hubs strategy, removing only a few dozen can reduce a network of millions of nodes to fragments.<br />One of Barabasi's most intriguing examples is the network of chemicals in a living cell, where two chemicals are \\"linked\\" if there's some reaction involving both of them.  The hubs turn out to be water, and the energy transporters ATP and ADP. But the degrees of separation are atypical among all the networks discussed, which raises some fascinating evolutionary issues.<br />I have only one complaint: I was left thirsty for more detail on everything.  And only one quibble: he enthuses at one point that mapping out the biochemical network will make the search for effective drugs a breeze, whereas it seems just as likely that it will make it plain that the search is impossibly hard. After all,  many of the classic examples of NP-complete problems come from the older (and, being static rather than dynamic, simpler) realm ofgraph theory.<br />In an ever more interconnected world, all of us are plugged in to a battery of dynamic networks. So Barabasi's book has vital application to every reader's life. How fortunate that he has made it so easy for every reader to grasp the shape and the rules of the linked life.	2002-08-01

Always slippery to define, except by enumeration of its canonical figures (William James, Charles Peirce, John Dewey), never in good odor in Europe, it fell into disrepute in America too at midcentury, since when its three one-time revolutionaries have largely been rebels without applause.<br />In this Pulitzer prize winner, Louis Menand aims to rekindle interest in the pragmatists' program, and assess at its proper weight the magnitude of their legacy. <br />This was the most unflaggingly entertaining historical essay I've read in years. At least as serious as \\"John Adams\\", it isn't remotely as ponderous. Its panorama of the American scene, from Daniel Webster and Henry Clay to Eugene V. Debs and Learned Hand, is densely and colorfully populated. It sparkles with wit, not just with humor but with wit in the older sense, delighting the reader with unexpected and apt connections.<br />For most of the book, I was swept along uncomplainingly in what seemed to be a rambling current of anecdote. I'd expected a book about philosophy, and it seemed I was getting one about philosophers (and politicians and naturalists and Union soldiers and Pullman porters). Only in the culminating Part Five do most of the eddies come together; and then you realize how artfully directed the random flow really was. What philosophers write typically comes across as numbingly abstract (even when, as in the case of these men, their philosophizing was aimed at exalting ordinary experience); summaries of what they write typically seem even more so. Therefore Menand spends most of his time constructing, strand by strand, a tapestry of the times in which these thinkers were imbedded, of the times' communal disasters and hopes, the social tensions, the political tugs of war, to which the creedless faith of James and the faithless creed of the others became the response. <br />As a result, when he grasps the nettle and writes directly about their philosophies, the issues become as concrete for us as they were for the pragmatists themselves. Brief as it is, his final section succeeds in getting directly at the heart of the four subjects' very different philosophies. I can't think of a comparably readable, sympathetic, and precisely expressive piece of popular philosophical exposition since Walter Kaufmann's definitive guide to the existentialists forty years ago.<br />Menand has chosen to expand the traditional triumvirate to a tetrad, adding Chief Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. Given his goal of grounding the pragmatic impulse in a generation's concrete experience, that choice was a brilliant stroke. Menand's main thesis is that pragmatism was born of a revulsion toward certainty, toward any conviction that one has hold of an absolute truth. That revulsion in turn was born of the horrors wrought by the noble abolitionists, and the noble defenders of Southern sovereignty, each so brimful of moral certainty. None of the canonical three pragmatists saw the ravages of the Civil War at first hand; but Holmes did. And out of that experience of what high ideals can produce, he rejected the idea that jurisprudence aims at an abstract perfect justice, much as the others rejected the idea that philosophy aims at an abstract perfect truth. (Justice for Holmes was the sum of what judges have decided, as truth for the other three men was the sum of the beliefs upon which men act.) Menand persuaded me that Holmes, whose adventures open and close the book, not only belongs in this company, but fitly epitomizes it.<br />Anyone who cares about both history and philosophy will love this book; anyone who cares about either will be diverted and instructed.	2002-07-25
US	52084271	R5BEJQOXCKCJ	0312890729	318023725	King Rat	Books	4	5	7	N	N	It really reeks. And I mean that in a good way.	When I got to the library, some other cove had checked out China Mieville's acclaimed second book \\"Perdido Street Station\\", but his first novel was still on the shelf, so I took it home instead. And through the two sittings it took me to devour it, I wasn't sorry.<br />It's no polished masterwork. In this off-center update of the Pied Piper story, China Mieville launched his fantasy career with a barbaric yawp. It gets in your face on the first page, and it never backs off for a minute. It's skanky, percussive, violent, low-rent, alive. Especially it gets up your nose, pulsating with the smells of underground London, a dozen abbatoirs and rubbish tips. Its prose dives deep, then surfaces with dripping redolent rinds of gritty poetry in its mouth. If great graphic novels could speak, they'd talk in accents just like these.<br />Okay, so that paragraph was a little purple. And \\"King Rat\\" is a *little* purple, forgivably so in a first effort, very forgivably in one with such a sharp, original, swiftly flowing story.  All the more forgivable because of the pleasure of the dialogue when King Rat takes center stage, and starts delivering a pyrotechnic Cockney rant like some Soho Davy Crockett in a bragging contest. (If his talk gets too obscure, try Googling for \\"Cockney rhyming slang\\" to find a relevant dictionary.) He's a marvelous creation, darkly comic and genuinely menacing.<br />For a marvel, Mieville makes his unlikely blend of proletarian realism, dance floor Jungle and Perraultian fairy tale work. I thoroughly enjoyed \\"King Rat\\", and now I'm spoiling for more, of what from an author this inventive will assuredly not be just more of the same.	2002-07-17
US	52084271	R2FRDC4ESHS78B	1579550088	20378952	A New Kind of Science	Books	3	105	113	N	N	Gorgeous, maddening, stimulating. And wrong.	I can't believe I read the whole thing.<br />I'm a sucker for cellular automata, so the week ANKOS came out, I snapped it up, on the theory that even if Wolfram's revolution turned out to be a fizzle, I'd learn a lot of new twists on CA.<br />True enough. There's a pretty neat 400 page book here on CAs (and other discrete algorithmic systems in the same spirit - call them SASs, simple algorithmic systems, for short.) The remaining 796 pages are maddening (tedious, vainglorious, repetitious, handwaving) and fascinating by turns. It's peppered with intriguing projects, results, insights and conjectures. But Wolfram is so determined not to scare off the laymen with any display of rigorous definition or deduction that it's usually impossible to tell when he is just pontificating and when he actually knows how to cash out a given statement.<br />For example, after making 1-dimensional CAs the centerpiece for eight chapters, Wolfram begins to tackle physics, and acknowledges that CAs aren't the right tool for the job, because space and time (worse, a time which contradicts special relativity by requiring absolute simultaneity) are already built in. In a tour de force, he shows how there's a broad class of SASs involving self-generating networks, out of which something very much like space and time and causality, and special relativity, get constructed as a natural byproduct. This is terrific stuff. But then he can't really suggest where to go for the next step, other than brute search through the zillions of such SASs in hopes of hitting on one that generates real world physics.<br />There are at least two gaping holes in Wolfram's presentation, which he shrugs off far too lightly.<br />First: He acknowledges that it is extremely hard, given a set of constraints, to find an SAS that satisfies them, even when the constraints are simple. His moral: don't bother thinking about  constraints. But out in the real world, it so happens that the realm of physics (both quantum mechanics and general relativity) does satisfy a complex and demanding set of constraints known as the principle of least action. Wolfram gives no reason for believing that an SAS satisfying such a complex constraint set will appear anytime in the first few billion, or the first few googol, of SASs studied. On the contrary, the rarity of 1-dimensional CAs satisfying the simple constraints he does examine strongly suggests the search for the New Kind of Physics will prove to be a wild goose chase.<br />Second: Thermodynamics, mathematical logic, and computer science have produced several sophisticated definitions for \\"complexity.\\" Wolfram discusses them briefly - too briefly for the lay reader to get even a weak grasp on what they mean - and dismisses them in favor of his own \\"type 4\\" complexity, which is never more rigorously defined than \\"complex enough to produce pictures that look kind of like these.\\" In chapter 11, he identifies this version of complexity with \\"universality\\", the ability of the system, if fed the proper initial conditions, to emulate a universal Turing machine. Astonishingly, he then asserts that all systems exhibiting \\"universality\\" - including such things as weather patterns and the vortices in a fast-draining tub - are essentially equivalent. He assumes that \\"ability to calculate x, given the right program\\" is the same as \\"ability to calculate x as fast as any other system, given the right program\\" - which is demonstrably false. And he assumes that \\"ability to calculate x, given the right program\\" is equivalent to \\"is as likely to calculate x in practice as any other system,\\" which ignores the difference between human beings (who not infrequently calculate a long string of primes, because that's the sort of inputs they feed into their own system) and his rule 110 (which will never in a quadrillion years calculate a long string of primes unless a system more \\"complex\\" than itself deliberately sets it up with the right initial conditions.)<br />Because it fails so monumentally to deliver on its promises, I can't give the book more than 2 and a half stars. As a sourcebook for cool ideas on ways to build models and otherwise play with computers, though, it rates a 4. People will be drawing ideas from this book for a long time to come - or at least from the more reader-friendly books it will inspire. But science as a whole will not be noticably altered.	2002-07-14

Was it the colorful, cunning, swaggering characters, telling their stories in memorably distinct voices? Calm, third person narrative is the rule this time. Our three main characters - the gregarious aristocrat Manlius Hippomanes, in the final months of the Roman Empire; the impetuous itinerant poet Olivier de Noyen, caught up in papal politics as the Black Death descends on Avignon; and the reclusive historian Julien Barneuve, coping with the demands of the Vichy regime during the Nazi hegemony - are all restrained and bookish men who aspire to live above the storms of passion. Many readers will find them disappointingly bloodless, but I'm not sure this is a flaw. Despite the three peculiar, parallel love stories at the center of the plot, this work intends to be classical rather than romantic in spirit. <br />But if you are the sort of person who dips into Gibbon's Decline and Fall for pleasure; if what attracted you to \\"Fingerpost\\" was the way it made bygone, alien ways of being human palpable; or the subtlety of its characters' intrigues and political calculations; or its philosophical sophistication; or its grasp of both the moral ambiguity of the human situation, and the imperative to behave morally in the face of that ambiguity - then \\"The Dream of Scipio\\" will give you at least the same level of satisfaction as the last book.<br />Be warned that there are murders here (what is human history if not a catalogue of murders?), but no murder mystery. There are elaborate compositional patterns to be noted, and a good deal of real history to be learned, but no \\"Name of the Rose\\" style conumdrums to be unravelled. Nevertheless, you'll be left bristling with questions - not the kind of questions that make you instantly begin rereading in order to collect clues, but the kind that make you hungry for a book club so the questions can be thought through in company: What is civilization, really, and why should we value it? What is and is not worth sacrificing in order to preserve it? What makes an act virtuous, its intents or its effects? Unlike most \\"idea\\" books, this one doesn't push one set of answers on you, rather it sets out the dilemmas, through concrete hard cases, in all their painful unresolvability.<br />Four and a half stars, highly recommended, but be aware of what you're getting into.	2002-07-10

I mean, thickens. The siblings gain some real allies, who will stick around for a while (not, of course, that it does them one stick of good), and they begin collecting clues to piece together a large puzzle.  Who is Count Olaf, really? What is his history? What is the meaning of the mysterious letters V.F.D.?

I admire the way he manages to distinguish carefully between solid knowledge, research trends, and unreplicated but interesting isolated results, without ever sounding pedantic (or even cautious.) It's almost two different books. One is a smooth, entertaining light read; the other is a scholarly summary, with every assertion backed up by notes and references to primary literature. You can read the first without noticing the second, but it's great to have both. And whether illustrating his points with news events and pop culture or with controlled academic studies, Schacter spoons down the medicine so deftly the casual reader will never taste anything but the sugar.<br />So is his medicine good for what ails you?<br />If your presenting complaint is simple curiosity about what is and is not known about memory, and about how your own memory is most likely to trip you up, and why - there's no better introduction available anywhere.<br />If you pick up the book out of concern for those &quot;senior moments&quot; that have been assailing you of late, Schacter will helpfully spell out how memory changes with age, what's normal and what's not, and he'll detail some small, lab-tested strategies that will help compensate. I found this feature mighty reassuring.<br />But I'd like to highlight a second area of practical application, which is forensic. &quot;Seven Sins&quot; makes clear how thoroughly unreliable eyewitness accounts can be. What's better, it indicates what factors (rarely the ones that juries trust) tend to make them more reliable. It also considers what mistakes can lead to the manufacture of &quot;recovered&quot; memories. (As a resident of Massachusetts, I earnestly wish our state's Supreme Judicial Court had read Schacter before slamming the cell door on the Fells Acre day care defendants.)<br />For its coverage of these forensic topics, mainly under the 'sins' of misattribution and suggestibility, the book deserves a very wide readership, and you'll want to remember it well on the day you get called up for jury duty. There are a lot of partisan tracts out there on both sides of legal memory issues, but Schacter's dispassionate explanation of what is and is not known will leave a deeper impression, and do higher service to the public good.<br />After a chapter on each of the 'sins' - transience, absent mindedness, blocking, misattribution, suggestibility, bias, and persistence - comes a final chapter arguing that each of these defects is a predictable byproduct of some useful feature of human memory. His argument is largely convincing, and goes a long way toward explaining why evolution (or divine design) left us saddled with these pervasive mental pecadillos.	2002-07-01

For them, I give this advice: go first to his novels (some of the best ones are \\"Ubik\\", \\"A Scanner Darkly\\", \\"Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch\\", \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\"). You have toimmerse yourself in his world to grasp where he's coming from, and short stories don't give you room to do that. The novels do.<br />For those who already know his stuff, this book is a treat. Besides the great title story, you'll see the seeds of several  of his novels here (\\"Palmer Eldritch\\" prefigured in \\"Days of Perky Pat\\", \\"Simulacrum\\" in \\"The Mold of Yancy\\", and \\"Ubik\\" in \\"What the Dead Men Say\\").	2002-06-20

But from all these snippets, what emerges is a biography of mathematics itself in the 20th century; a sense for the marvelous, moving, growing organism that has been the mathematical quest.<br />Many bright men and women, many geniuses, populate these pages. But with two exceptions (Georg Cantor, the mystical grandfather of modern logic and set theory; and the remarkable Teiji Takagi, who built Japanese mathematical culture, and the class field theory that led to solutions for three of Hilbert's 23, all seemingly with his bare hands) they didn't wield their chalk in solitary splendor. They formed a web made of learning, mentoring, competing, collaborating, inspiring; a web that converged on and spread out from two tumultuous epicenters of the century's math activity: Goettingen in Germany (until Hitler drove out all its best minds), and Princeton's Institute for Advanced Studies.<br />There are four parts biography to one part math here. That should make the book as approachable for laymen as it is delightful for the math sophisticates who'll get to put faces on all those familiar old names. The address in which Hilbert set out his problems is given in full as an appendix; and those who wish to pursue the technical topics further get a bibliography rich enough to keep them occupied for years.<br />You'll get only tantalizing tastes, best in the earliest and latest chapters, of the nitty-gritty content of 20th century mathematics. But you will get a doubleplusgood, full-length portrait of what it became as a social and cultural enterprise.	2002-06-11

His only major appearance is on the title page. It's a hundred years or two on from the events in the second section of \\"A Canticle for Leibowitz.\\" The Nomad hordes of the plains, and the clergy of the captive church in New Rome, have grown restive under the yoke of Texark. Something's got to give.<br />In this book, we have a large fragment of what would have been a superb novel. It doesn't have the youthful energy or the tight plotting of Miller's earlier masterpiece. And had he survived to complete and polish it, I suspect it would still lack those qualities. SLATWHW is much more a work of realism. If it moves slowly and wanders loosely, well, real life - and especially real history - are like that, too.<br />As we now have it, the novel breaks a few implicit contracts. First, we expect the on-again, mostly off-again love story between Brother Blacktooth and the mutant AEdrea to reach some climactic reunion or breakup. Despite the transparently tacked-on final chapter, it does no such thing. Second, we expect the forces of unambiguous evil, the Hannegan empire and its lackey churchmen, to be defeated by the forces of ambiguous good. It doesn't work out that way. Third, the Church with its supposed monopoly on miracles, and AEdrea with her secular wild talent for healing, are on an obvious collision course. No showdown comes. Though the book does have its boring stretches, I think it's this cheating of expectations that accounts for many of the one and two star reviews here.<br />But for all the strands left untied in the personal hopes and fears of the main characters, Miller leaves no loose threads in the four-dimensional world he has imagined. If you want to get the greatest pleasure out of the book, for instance, don't make the mistake of lumping all the \\"Nomads\\" together. Each tribe has its own history, customs, leaders - and by the time you're halfway through, you'll realize there *will* be a quiz.<br />What kept me reading was the density of the imagined cultural and political detail, and the fully rounded portrayals of the two main characters - Blacktooth and the ambitious Cardinal Brownpony - each full of contradictions, each always recognizably himself. The supporting cast, from the (unfortunately ever mysterious) AEdrea, to the mystical headsman Axe, to the holy fool who becomes Pope Amen II (\\"We should always be ashamed to speak of God in the third person\\"), may not be as complex, but they are worth getting to know.<br />Lurking in the crevices of SLATWHW is a five-star work. If only the hermit of Leibowitz Abbey had loaned Miller a few more decades of his longevity! But as it is, I rate it at three and a half stars. The writing is spotty, and too much stays unresolved.

Nitrous oxide has nothing on these two elevators. I haven't laughed so hard, so continuously, since P.G. Wodehouse ushered me into the presence of the immortal Jeeves thirty years ago.<br />Hiassen's work seems to divide neatly into the early stuff, up through Skin Tight, which inhabits the same danger-ridden, darkly comic territory as Elmore Leonard, with similarly razor-edged dialogue; and the later stuff, which forms a genre of its own, savagely satirical farces that cast credibility and all sense of human decency and restraint to the winds in order to skewer every form of foible and malefaction. I love them both, but prefer the latter, to which \\"Native Tongue\\" squarely belongs. Here the targets range from Sea World to Disney to phone sex purveyors and their clients to fuzzy animal lovers to bodybuilders to birdwatchers. With his usual heaping helpings of lawyers, developers,  politicians, and like members of the lower criminal orders. Not least among them, tied like Pauline to the railroad tracks of imminent extinction, those adorable blue-tongued mango voles. And you won't want to miss a single savory chunk of kabob on the master's shish.<br />I notice that the reviewers all seem to like best the first Hiassen they happened to read, and I'm no exception. This one, \\"Sick Puppy\\", and his first entry , \\"Tourist Season\\", by me are the champs.  But I suspect if you were to ask Carl for his favorite, he'd direct you straight here to his Cage au Voles, because this is the one where he got to lampoon the South Florida theme park - an excrescence so dear to his heart that he made it the subject of \\"Team Rodent\\", his only nonfiction volume to date.	2002-05-22

There is more sober description on offer here than prescription. Conservatives remembering Kevin Phillip's prescient 1969 advice (\\"The Emerging Republican Majority\\") on how the GOP could dominate the rest of the century will be even more disappointed; Phillips sees the time as ripe for a progressive realignment that will bring nothing but pain to the Lott/Armey axis.<br />The book recounts, at two different scales, the history of wealth and the elites to which it has accumulated. The shorter scale is that of American political cycles, with revolving eras of conservative wealth concentration and progressive wealth distribution.  The longer scale concerns the cycle of rise and fall of the four great economic empires of modern history: Spain in the 17th century, Holland in the 18th, Britain in the 19th, and the U.S. in the 20th. He returns to each series of cycles repeatedly, with an emphasis on different aspects of the cycles: the roles of technology, of wars, of speculative bubbles, of fashions in legislation and ideology. The repetition occasionally threatens tedium, but fresh details rise up to relieve it. Along the way, he provides a feast of specifics and statistics, in easily accessible charts which the reader will find useful whether or not he agrees with Phillips' conclusions.  <br />The message he gleans from the shorter scale is a familiar one, if something of a minority report in the current era. Money flows. In hard times, it trickles; in boom times, it roars in cataracts. At no time, as he richly documents, has its motion ever been determined primarily by \\"market forces.\\"  It has always been pumped from pocket to pocket by the grace of government.<br />And money has proven to be a highly compressible fluid. During each of America's great wars - the Revolution, the Civil War, and the two World Wars - profits have been compressed and pooled among a few suppliers of loans and materiel, creating new moneyed elites. In those eras which have exalted \\"the market\\" - the Gilded Age, the roaring twenties, and our current period - government has pumped the refreshing liquid from the middle class to those elites; in eras exalting reform and democracy - the political realignments of Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln, and the two Roosevelts - the direction has been reversed, though never to the point of actually dismantling the old fortunes.<br />Inequality of wealth in the U.S. has now reached the highest levels we've enjoyed since 1929, with the top 1% owning 44% of the goodies. And of course, the primary purpose and effect of the Bush tax cuts is to pump a still higher percentage to the same elite. The inequality peak may not yet be in sight, the figure at the height of the Gilded Age having been about 60%; but history informs us that ultimately these levels of inequality aren't sustainable. Phillips doesn't venture to say how long it will be until the next realignment; but each time it has happened, the suddenness and vehemence of middle class anger has taken the rich elite by surprise.<br />On the broader scale of national fall and rise, the message is more somber: Phillips believes we are on the cusp of a fall. He lists ten characteristics shared by Spain, Holland, and England on the brink of decline (most notably, growing income disparity, export of manufacturing with profits coming largely from the financial sector, and vigorous rejection of tarriffs), all of which are plainly rampant in the present U.S. economy.<br />It's difficult to walk away from this book with a sound bite summary. Our author is examining complex interlocked patterns across centuries. What you'll walk away with is an enlarged perspective, and perhaps a worried mind.	2002-05-21

Here it's polished like fine crystal: no flashy lyricism, no polysyllabic raids on Roget, just limpid phrases that speak freshly and place you, antennae quivering, in the center of the scene. \\"The Translator\\" presents itself as a quiet, small, well-lighted novel, a chamber piece with only four or five speaking parts. On those terms, it succeeds just about perfectly.<br />In a sense, all of Crowley's novels, even those set in some far future, have been historical novels. Lately, he's become confident enough to choose periods his readers can remember. His ongoing tetralogy (begun in \\"Aegypt\\") has been bringing the mid seventies back to life with perfect political and cultural pitch; \\"The Translator\\" does the same for the repressed, restless, hopeful, doom-haunted Zeitgeist of the few years between Eisenhower's fifties and LBJ's sixties. Within that grey-lit zone unfolds the story of a campus romance. Its special tincture of the erotic with the Platonic - when a Russian interlocutor, many years later, asks our heroine Kit whether she and Professor Falin were \\"lovers\\", she is honestly unable to remember - would have rung false in any other epoch.<br />But while Kit narrates her simple story, Crowley has many other fish surreptitiously sizzling in the fire. He is studying the nature of translation, the nature of personal identity, the nature of national identity; the ways in which poetry fails to be genuine poetry both when it is, and when it is not, politically \\"relevant.\\" And finally the themes and the personal histories of this uncharacteristically realistic novel do not appear to be resolvable, apart from the angelic mythology explored in Falin's final poem.<br />I rate this book at four and a half stars, but I round it up because of my strong feeling that there's much more here than has yet met my eye. Perpetually fluttering his wings at this volume's edges and crannies is the figure of Vladimir Nabokov - also a \\"translator\\", also a Russian poet in exile, like Kit a fan of Lewis Carroll's Alice, and who famously adopted a position with regard to political relevance in art seemingly diametrically opposed to the one taken by Crowley's Falin. So, I suspect that this book is even more carefully crafted than its exquisite surface would suggest. In particular, its' worth considering whether by the time the story ends it is only poems that have been \\"translated.\\"kov - also a \\"translator\\", also a Russian poet in exile, like Kit a fan of Lewis Carroll's Alice, and who famously adopted a position with regard to political relevance in art seemingly diametrically opposed to the one taken by Crowley's Falin.

Could it possibly be as good as I remembered it? Would the great-granddaddy of all nuclear apocalypse books  seem like a period piece, now that we know mankind has dodged the mushroom-shaped bullet?<br />It was better than I remembered it. There's so much wisdom, so much breadth of sympathy for humanity in every state of belief and unbelief, so much erudition, so many sly jokes I hadn't caught the first three times.  The more you learn, the more you grow, the more you'll find this remarkable book has to offer. (And, incidentally, the book stretches your perceptions further than yesterday's headlines. Yes, mankind has dodged one nuclear bullet; but our self-destructive folly is still with us, the weapons have not been destroyed, and our wise leaders have begun telling us it's important to keep the ones we have in reserve, and a good idea to build more of them.)<br />The book begins after atomic apocalypse, abetted by mob rage, has dismanteld all of civilization except the Catholic Church. It is structured as a series of three novellas, separated by centuries of future time. These novellas, linked by a common location at the abbey of Saint Leibowitz in the Utah desert, encourage identification with richly detailed , funny, admirable characters; and then enforce a cool objectivity by sweeping those characters away into the dust of the past. The simultaneous caring attachment and disengagement that result are more effective than any theological treatise in conveying a sense of what it might be like to practice the virtue known as charity.<br />On one level, the whole book becomes a medieval _memento mori_, a reminder of the transience of life. On another level, it is a tryptich: an ornate altarpiece painted in three realistic panels.  The panels proceed from near future to far future, and from innocence (the bumbling and easily awed novice Brother Francis, through whose misadventures the Blessed Leibowitz becomes canonized) to devastating experience (the abbot of Saint Leibowitz, providing for the continuity of a human race that may never outgrow its self-destructiveness, forced to impose and to suffer crucifixions, and to watch an hours-old child begotten by virgin birth die before his eyes.)<br />The midcentury saw four great sf novels on the theme of the apocalypse.  One (George Stewart's \\"Earth Abides\\") preceded this one, and in its own way matched its dignity and grandeur, though not its multileveled complexity. The other two, Zelazny and Dick's \\"Deus Irae\\" and Fritz Leiber's \\"A Specter Is Haunting Texas\\", both now sadly out of print, owe obvious debts to Miller's work. But in the end, Leibowitz stands alone.	2002-05-07

Haldane who said, &quot;I suspect that the universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose.&quot; John Keel's most seminal work is dedicated to the proposition that the universe is even queerer than that. Is he for real?  Is the universe for real?  Did any of this mishegass, other than the briefly famous bridge collapse, really happen? I don't know; but there is no better guide into the surreal realms of &quot;high strangeness&quot; than Mr. Keel, and if you can suspend disbelief for a couple of hundred pages, you will at the very least have heard the creepiest campfire story ever told.<br />More than any other living writer, Keel has inherited the slippery mantle of the late great Charles Fort.  He shares Fort's daring, his sardonic sense of humor, his tender concern that &quot;damned&quot; facts not disappear into oblivion, his naive acceptance of every story that comes down the pike, his generous willingness to entertain any theory, and his delight in watching perverse phenomena blow every theory to smash. But if Keel's really a reincarnation, then Fort must have learned how to write during his last go-round in the Bardo, because Fort was hard slogging and this book is a zippy ride.<br />What Keel gives us is a set-piece blocking all exits from what might as well be known as Keel's Law: &quot;Ufology is a subdiscipline of demonology.&quot; He gives us a community and a year, Point Pleasant West Virginia in 1966, where UFOs are nearly as common as fireflies, where eight-foot birds with glowing eyes engage in VTOLs without moving their wings, where Men In Black patrol the streets and synchronicities run riot, where insectoid voices control the horizontal and the vertical on  phone lines AT&amp;T thought belonged to them, where contactees receive eerily precise prophecies that are wrong about everything except their specifics. Keel draws no coherent lesson from all this, except that we are cockeyed optimists if we persist in thinking of reality as coherent.<BR> <BR>Personally, I suspect that Keel's Law is right, and further that demonology is also a subdiscipline of psychology, but of a psychology that academia has not yet begun to penetrate, and would be well advised to look into carefully. (Check out Bryan's book &quot;Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind&quot;, about an abductee conference that MIT was once tricked into hosting, for some initial clues about the trail such a psychology might follow.) In any case, this book demands a place on any shelf of UFO literature, however short. It represents a nutty, true-unbeliever extreme by dint of which the rest of the shelf, the skeptical and the puzzled and the true believers alike, will be kept honest.	2002-05-06

Maybe I'm just jaded from reading too many open-mouthed catalogs of strange facts over too many years. Coleman is one of today's most popular practitioners of the genre, and he certainly is better than the average. His attitude is more like Charles Fort's than like Erik von Daniken's. You may disagree with his conclusions, or find his recital of testimonies credulous, but you feel he is being straight with you, and that he is aware of the value of sometimes just letting mystery be. If you own a bunch of books of this kind, and are hungry for more, you should bump the rating up another star.<br />I found myself suspecting this particular volume was slapped together under this title to generate extra sales in the wake of the Mothman movie. The Mothman himself takes up less than a third of the book. No significant info is added to what John Keel wrote in his 1975 book (and a good deal of that left out, as not relevant to Coleman's real theme.) We do get some neat new Keel quotes and anecdotes that spotlight his startling personality. And that's fun, but the same personality was fully on display in Keel's book, too.<br />So if it's not &quot;about&quot; Mothman, what is it about?  It is a brief Fortean treatise on cryptozoology - the study of animals, especially large animals, unknown to science. It touches on well known stars like Sasquatch and Nessie, but concentrates on flaps in which cryptozoology bumps up against &quot;high weirdness,&quot; and seems to call for investigations as much by unnatural historians as by natural ones. Thunderbirds, Cupachabras, giant black dogs with fiery eyes, and lizard men predominate.<br />There are no footnotes, but there's a good bibliography. There's also an odd 18-page index of &quot;places of high strangeness&quot; in the U.S. and Canada. It's odd in that it's just a list of names, by state and province, with no indication of what's weird about any one of them. There are bound to be several within driving distance of your home... I guess you just drive there, stake your tent, and try to be ready for anything.	2002-04-22

Books	3	10	14	N	N	A great jumping off point for jumping up and down	Michael Moore's heart and his big fat mouth are both in the right place. He aspires to be the left wing's answer to Rush Limbaugh, and he succeeds in being as colorful, as funny, as relentlessly outraged. He succeeds in gathering as sweeping an array of factoids tailor-made to stir the blood of any self respecting American, with the difference that his factoids are aimed at stirring things up to afflict the comfortable, instead of at  stirring things up to kick the comfortless while they're down.<br />... he also emulates Rush in often not bothering to get his factoids right. To his credit, *most* of them are accurate, including the one most shocking assertion, that Dubya only \\"won\\" Florida because his brother's administration deliberately and successfully set out to disenfranchise thousands of black Floridan voters in advance. And unlike Rush, he does provide footnotes, so the diligent reader can check up on a good deal of what he says.<br />It's a fun read, swift if not altogether Swiftian. As a collection of liberal Usenet flames, this would be a classic: raunchy, intelligent, principled, often devastating, intermittently hilarious. But from a hardcover book we have a right to expect a higher journalistic standard than we ordinarily apply to flame-meisters.<br />So, read it by all means. Most of it is true, and it may motivate some of us to do more to grab control of the Republic back from the one-star reviewers here, who take it as articles of religious faith that we'll never be safe from Communism until all the world's air, water, and sunlight are duly privatized, and that the market will never be truly free until the final glorious merger places it all, together with the U.S. Congress, under the exclusive control of one megacorporation. But before you introduce Moore's nuggets into the stream of political discourse yourself, take the time to learn whether the particular nugget is a misinterpretation, an exaggeration, or a real live horror. God knows the reality is fearsome enough. The good guys can safely leave the truth-stretching franchise to the other side.	2002-04-10

Steven Jay Gould, was one of our deepest, most creative and most careful evolutionary thinkers, here delivered his magnum opus, and it inevitably rates five stars for importance. And, yes, those essays from Natural History have given you a lot of pleasure over the years. But, good Lord, look at the heft of the thing! Would you perhaps be better advised to give it a pass?<br />The answer is no, not if you really care about where evolutionary theory is going during the next forty years. It's true that it's longer than it had to be, and many of its luxuriating sentences are more like a bush than a tree. A good editor could have helped Gould bring it down to 1000 pages or so, and improved it thereby. But the main reason it's such a doorstop is because it's busy opening so many doors. There's far too much to respond to and critique in a review of Amazon length. So what I'm going to do is provide cheats and spoilers: I'll say what you can skip or skim without missing gist or cream, and then give a *very* brief precis of that gist.<br />THE QUICK TOUR.<BR>Chapter One. <BR>Chiefly a summary of what's to come, a summary so dense and abstract that it's likely to convince many readers, falsely, that the book is going to be unreadable. (In the paperback edition, please add a brief glossary!) Scoop up the material on Scilla's coral (pp. 12-24) and save the rest for later. <br />Part I. <BR>The next 6 chapters survey the history of evolutionary thought, with a focus on old controversies Gould believes need re-opening, albeit at a higher level. As influential as Gould's been as a scientist, his real genius is for history of ideas, and these chapters are a richly rewarding read, very reminiscent of his Natural History essays in tone. But all that's needed to follow the main thread of the book's arguments are chapter 2 (an illuminating tour of Darwin's \\"Origin\\"), some talk about how Darwin dealt with the generation of diversity (pp. 224-229), the metaphor of Galton's polyhedron (pp.342-351), and, to show what Gould is contrasting himself with, the exposition of how the \\"Modern Synthesis\\" of the 40s and 50s froze Darwinism into a rigid form (all of chapter 7).<br />Part II<BR>Little is skippable. The last 50 pages of chapter seven, the punk eek centerpiece, discuss the abuses poured on punk eek by nefarious parties like Dawkins and creationists. It's juicy, but peripheral. The passages on D'Arcy Thompson (pp. 1182-1208) and on mass extinctions (all of chapter 12) are necessary to the organizational scheme, but not necessary to the logic or substance of Gould's \\"one long argument.\\"<br />WHAT IT HAS TO SAY...<br />Darwin gave us a slam-dunk proof of the fact of common descent, which no scientist but the aging Aggasiz has seriously disputed since. But initially his causal theory of how it happened drew a great deal of fire. For the first 60 years after the Origin, the woods were crawling with evolutionists, some of them naturalists at the top of their game, who wanted to replace natural selection with some other mechanism. Darwin triumphed, Gould tells us, because his basic idea was right. But now the time has come for major upheaval and revision, because several of his major secondary commitments were mistaken.<br />What Gould says Darwin got right: Selection acting on ordinary variation, which is in some sense random, is what produces almost all evolutionary change.<br />Mistaken secondary commitment 1: Selection acts only on individual organisms. Gould argues that selection acts up and down the hierarchy - on genes, cells, organisms, demes, species, and clades, but (other than organisms) especially on species, because species have the sort of cohesion that makes for good selective \\"individuals.\\"<br />Mistaken secondary commitment 2: The environment shapes almost all change, by selective pressures which mold adaptations. Gould points out that Darwin's argument for this thesis rests on the assumption that variation is \\"isotopic\\" - equally likelyin all directions - and \\"imperceptible.\\" He argues that recent genetic discoveries prove the contrary: deep homologies across phyla make certain major inventions such as optical lenses more likely than others, and small genetic changes in homeobox and other regulatory genes can lead to very perceptible variations, in preferred directions. And consequently, the direction of change is shaped as much by internal availabilities - creating \\"exaptations\\" - as by external selective pressures creating adaptations.<br />Mistaken secondary commitment 3: Selective pressure is always producing small changes, and these are always accumulating in the direction of greater fitness; simple extrapolation from them can account for the whole panoply of living things. Gould argues that (1) selective pressures fail to produce change most of the time, the phenomenon of stasis first highlighted as part of punctuated equilibrium, and (2) the changes don't accumulate. Rather, among organisms within a species, they mostly fluctuate back and forth, unless a change gets locked in by being isolated in a new species. And any trends across species are the result of selection at the species or clade levels, a kind of selection with its own emergent mechanisms not extrapolatable from Darwinian natural selection among organisms.<br />Is all this really all that revolutionary? Gould clearly documents how vehemently each item in the programme he outlines was denied and resisted by the old guard of the Modern Synthesis; if he seems to be making a mountain out of a molehill, it's mostly because we've grown so used to offenses against pure Darwinism in the last twenty-five years. Certainly the positions he takes open myriad fruitful lines of future inquiry. And that's really what he's after. In his \\"segue\\" between parts one and two, he notes that the time is not now ripe for still another New Synthesis; we don't know enough yet. He says that he intends this book as an antithesis to the Modern Synthesis,undoubtedly overstated and overreaching, but likely to spur the birth of the next synthesis in its own good Hegelian time. Despite (and perhaps even because) of the numerous criticisms and counter-arguments that I found myself penciling into the margins of Gould's \\"Structure\\", I think his tome will admirably serve that prodding purpose.	2002-04-02

Frankly, if I'd started out with this effort, I might not have gone on to devour so much of her stuff. Back at the end of the eighties she had not yet perfected her writing style, and it can get pretty dry, especially in the long chapters which aren't about the Crusades, but about the history of the middle east since 1947. I've been around for most all of that history, and (except for some illuminating pages about the internal politics of Egypt) it was a twice told tale to me. <br />The sixty percent that dealt with the Crusades themselves, though, and the roots of Zionism, gave me what I wanted: a quickie primer on a large swath of history that, just as Armstrong says, continues to be deeply relevant to today's headlines, but about which I knew next to nothing. Some of that history is fascinating in its own right: the instant myth of \\"the Children's Crusade\\", how the sixth Crusade came to be led by an emperor whom the Pope excommunicated as he sailed for the east; Saint Francis' mission to the Saracens, and a good deal more.<br />It's also true that the publisher whipped the book out of cold storage after 9/11, with just a few paragraphs of additional commentary from the author, so all of the modern information is a decade out of date. I expected that, so it wasn't an annoyance.<br />Overall, I give it 3 and a half stars.  I was going to call it three, until I got a gander at all the negative reviews here, largely from people who seem to go ballistic at the notion that Islam isn't profoundly evil to its core. <br />I disagree with those reviews. By no means does this book cater to political correctness in order to give the Islamic corner of the religious triad a free ride. Here, as in all her books, Karen Armstrong is fair minded, and fair minded almost to a fault. Yes, she bends over backwards to see the Arabic world from its own point of view; because she bends over backwardsto see every culture she talks about from its own point of view. She doesn't mince the ugly events: she calls a spade a spade, a broken treaty a broken treaty, a massacre a massacre, and violent fanaticism violent fanaticism, no matter who is perpetrating it. There's plenty here to offend all three of the Abrahamic faiths, since all three have been guilty of idiocies and atrocities, which each has papered over with embarrassed silence.<br />She does devote more space and energy to presenting the Islamic interpretation of events. But that's an unavoidable part of her job, since we her readers are already fully familiar with the Christian and Jewish points of view on all this long and sorry history (and that was even more true when the book was written a decade ago.) I didn't get the sense that her reportage of the events themselves was skewed in any way, and she leaves the readers free to make alternate interpretations if we so desire.<br />It's an introduction, by an intelligent non-historian with commendably wide sympathies. It doesn't pretend to be a be-all and end-all. I'm glad to have got this primer under my belt. I made it through the dry parts, and enjoyed the medieval parts, and it made me feel better prepared to tackle a more substantial work, like Hourani's _History of the Arab People_, which has been sitting on my shelf intimidatingly for a few years now.	2002-03-28
US	52084271	R1YPH0C5VS407M	0743235150	796500127	Everything's Eventual: 14 Dark Tales	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Gunsels and vampires and boomslangs, oh my!	My first exposure to Stephen King, way back in 76, was the short story collection \\"Night Shift.\\" I knew I'd found something extroardinary. Since then I've snapped up everything in print bearing the SK logo. Along the way, I've learned that every second or third novel will prove disappointing. Compulsively readable, yes, unfailingly entertaining, sure, but self-indulgent or repetitive or stuffed with too much padding. But something about short story writing brings out the craftsman in King. When you walk home with his latest doorstop, you know there may not be much of a pig in that poke; but with his short story collections you just can't go wrong.<br />The new smorgasbord is no exception. Two of the fourteen tales are forgettable. (Bob Dylan once admitted that he named one album \\"John Wesley Harding\\" because he hoped it would distract attention from the fact that the song so named had by far the weakest lyrics on the album. I wonder if King's claim that \\"L.T.'s Theory of Pets\\" is his favorite story in the collection is an example of the same strategy.) But nine of them are classics. Not a bad ratio. So this tough grader's 4 and a half stars are getting rounded up this time.<br />The ominous cover art had me hovering over each tale, wondering when I'd get to the one the cover illustrated. If you want to go straight to it, it's \\"Lunch at the Gotham Cafe,\\" a tour de force on several levels, not the least being its seamless marriage of low grossout and high elegance. It's the elegance, and the mental rather than the literal mayhem, that will stick with you.<br />The longest story is an out-take from the Dark Tower cycle, which is good news. (Even better news is that the next volume of DT is completed. It appears that - just like Harry Potter - it will be rounded out in seven volumes.) There's nothing in this vampire-story prequel that fans of the series will need to know to understand the Dark Tower cosmos, but it cried out to be set in Roland's universe. It has the same edge-of-the-world creepiness, the same heroic despair, the same vast desolation bathed in the same bright but slanted light.<br />I think what delighted me most about this collection was the variety of voices. We've all grown used to King's standard narrator, his head stuffed with the speech habits and the cultural detritus of the American baby boom. He shows up again, with slightly updated cultural artifacts, in the pimply ex-pizza-delivery boy of the title story, trapped in the world's cushiest and most sinister dead end job. But an older, deeper American tone runs through \\"The Man in the Black Suit,\\" which plays on rural silences and folklore like Manly Wade Wellman's best stories did with deep Appalachia; and in \\"The Death of Jack Hamilton\\", an incident in John Dillinger's life which could have happened exactly like that, and if it had, would have been told in exactly that language.<br />My favorite piece hasn't a breath of the supernatural in it. \\"All That You Love Will Be Carried Away\\" is a story about the impending death of a travelling salesman, losing a long struggle with clinical depression, who may or may not be saved in the end by his infectious enthusiasm for bathroom graffiti. I admire Miller's portrait of Willy Loman, but in this deftly turned story King made me really care about Alfie Zimmer. <br />And of course the traditional chills are all there, in spades: a hotel room haunted by worse than ghosts, a man helplessly watching his own autopsy in process (which is where that boomslang shows up), a lapsed Catholic's worst nightmare complete with Mother Theresa, a reverse twist on the phantom hitchhiker, and the scariest story about a painting since Lovecraft's \\"Pickman's Model.\\"<br />If you've ever liked King, you'll cherish this batch. Read one each night, and they'll last you from the full of the moon to pitch darkness.	2002-03-24

Each of the first three books<br />is all but independent of the rest, told in its own distinct voice. They interlock, but in subtle ways - through common<br />geography, family names that link with the long history of Dalemark and its peculiar \\"gods\\". Diana Wynne Jones always<br />provides the pleasure of well-told, formula-busting stories. In her Quartet, she also provides the pleasure of watching an<br />intricate pattern unfold behind the stories.<br />The third volume is the true heart of the series, epic and mysterious, bright-lit and misty, awash in magical happenings and still more magical lyricism. \\"The Spellcoats\\" is the only book in the Quartet which is told in the first person. The voice we hear belongs to a young girl named Tanaqui, living with her family and her family's collection of gods on the banks of the great River. She doesn't speak her story, or write it - she weaves the words into an intricately detailed \\"rugcoat\\", a kind of wearable diary. The time is many centuries before the Dalemark of the first two volumes. There are no guns or bombs, scarcely any musical instruments, and the continent has a different shape, dominated by the one huge brown north-flowing river, worshipped by Tanaqui's neighbors as a god in its own right.<br />The surprising mythology of this dawn world comes slowly into focus for us as Tanaqui weaves her story. Neither her family, nor the river-worshipers, nor the \\"Heathens\\" with whom her whole country is at war, quite understand what the \\"gods\\" really are, or the predicament those gods are in. Their religions all have a piece of the truth, and the whole truth must be pieced together to defend the land from the evil mage Kankredin, who imprisons the souls of the dead in his far-flung nets.<br />Just for rousing storytelling, I give volumes 1 and 3 four and a half stars, volumes 2 and 4 four stars. But the Quartet is more<br />than the sum of its parts, and the series as a whole merits five.	2002-03-13

The plots and counterplots he's embroiled in come to a head at the port's spring festival, when all the nobles must take part in a grand procession to the sea, carrying the festival effigies of Drowned Ammet and Libby Beer to be cast into the harbor. No one remembers why the ritual has to be performed, but no one dares to alter the tradition.<br />Well, Drowned Ammet may remember. And perhaps that's why everyone's best laid plans start going queer...<br />Family drama, peril on the high seas, ancient magics awakened - there's a lot of action packed into these pages. Young adults will love it, and Ms. Jones proves once again to her crossover adult audience that YA doesn't *always* stand for Yawns Assured.<br />Just for rousing storytelling, I give volumes 1 and 3 four and a half stars, volumes 2 and 4 four stars.  But the Quartet is more than the sum of its parts, and the series as a whole merits five.	2002-03-13
US	52084271	R29BM70TQOK1PF	0064473139	920682474	Cart and Cwidder (Dalemark Quartet, Vol. 1)	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Original, character-driven fantasy	In the Dalemark Quartet, of which this is the first volume, Diana Wynne Jones is attempting something fresh and ambitious. Unlike the standard fantasy series, in which each volume follows the continuing adventures of a single cast of characters - a series of tunes played on the same set of instruments - this one really is designed as a \\"quartet\\". Each of the first three books is all but independent of the rest, told in its own distinct voice. They interlock in many ways, but in subtle ones - common geography, a set of family names that link with the long history of Dalemark and its peculiar \\"gods\\", known in Dalemark as the Undying. Only halfway through the third book does the depth of the historical and the very original mythological patterns begin to come into focus. The \\"quartet\\" of voices - the travelling singer Moril in this book, the sailor's apprentice Mitt in the second, the weaver Cennoreth in the third, and the time travelling teen Maewen in the last - are neatly balanced. The two boys are from the Dalemark's \\"present,\\" an age of political intrigues with a three musketeers flavor, and the girls are from the far past and the not so far future. One of each gender is from the North, the other from the South, and the ultimate task facing them all is to reunite the torn land under a single monarch.<br />Each of the first three volumes on its own comprises a satisfying story, if a bit open-ended. Cart and Cwidder is the most successful as a stand-alone story. The lute-like cwidder that Moril's father plays for a living as the family's gipsy cart wends through Dalemark's towns gradually discloses its magical powers, but it's the play of personalities that will keep you turning the pages.<br />There's the daydreaming Moril, his father Clennen, the jovial showman, his older brother Dagner, brimming with talent but painfully shy, his perceptive and sharp-tongued sister Brid, their mysteriously quiet high-born mother Lenina, and an elusive paying passenger whose humility seems like mockery. All these vivid first impressions are real, but they all turn out to be just surface manifestations of the deeper waters running through every member of the troupe. <br />You'll want to hear more about Moril's adventures when you finish Cart and Cwidder. Be advised that you'll have to lay your eagerness aside. All the members of the quartet will be brought together again in the long fourth volume, where Moril's voice will carry only a little of the melody; and there are three solos to be played in full before the final harmonizing.	2002-03-08
US	52084271	R3V52SZF3R3CQF	0691090866	784732871	Hubbert's Peak: The Impending World Oil Shortage	Books	5	52	60	N	N	Only one more oil crisis, but it'll be a doozy	While millions of environmentally concerned Americans are ready to vilify on reflex what Molly Ivins flippantly dubs &quot;the oil bidness,&quot; Kenneth Deffeyes thinks of the petroleum fields as a place of high spirits and high romance. But, having spent half his life working for Shell, and half of it training later generations of fossil fuel hunters, he is here to break the bad news to us gently. And the news is, the party's over. The days of derring-do among the derricks are just about done.<br />Thirty years ago, U.S. oil production peaked, and has been declining ever since. Shortly, world oil production will hit the same peak, and begin to decline. That doesn't mean there will be no oil left; thirty years after hitting its own peak, the U.S. is still the second largest oil producer in the world. But it does mean that demand will outstrip supply, and that means the economic dislocations of the late 70s - the spiking prices, the long gas lines, the deep recession - will become permanent. Eventually, other sources of energy, both renewables and plentiful fossil fuels like natural gas, will fill in the breach. But it will be a long and painful process, requiring a ton of capital investments in research and in infrastructure that a suddenly poorer first world will be ill able to afford.<br />&quot;Shortly&quot;, Deffeyes argues, means in one to six years, and probably in the early part of that range. One can quibble with some of his arguments for that timing. With luck, he acknowledges, there may be one significant set of oil fields yet to be discovered, in the South China Sea (unexplored so far because the competing jurisdictions of the several nearby island nations have made contracts hard to nail down.) And I don't think he's given sufficient weight to the fact that all the oil recovery in the Middle East is still &quot;primary&quot;, using old-fashioned pumping technology. But if all the quibbles are granted, it only affords the world economy another five or ten years of grace.<br />So, if Deffeyes is wrong, the time to start making those massive investments and changes is today.  If he is right, the time to start making them is ten years ago, and all we can accomplish by swift action is to make the period of intense pain a decade or two shorter. Though Professor Deffeyes isn't political enough or impolite enough to say so, Clinton (for all his green talk) failed to provide any leadership to reduce our dependence on petroleum. And his successor, of course, is providing energetic leadership, but all of it is geared to marching us all double-time into still more rapid consumption of what little oil is left. History will remember neither President Slick, nor President Oil Slick, any more kindly than it now remembers Herbert Hoover for fiddling while the fuse that would set off the Great Depression burned. <br />The book is an easy read, short and set in a conversational style that permits the reader to glide through the more technical portions if so inclined. The technical details and the mathematical arguments could be tighter, and the folksiness, which would be delightful in a lecture room, is occasionally a bit much on the written page. For those reasons, it would be easy to give the book only four stars.  But those faults are inseparable from the book's virtues. They're compromises Deffeyes chose to make in order to be accessible to a wide audience, and his book deserves to reach one.<br />If environmentalists take Deffeyes' message seriously,they'll realize that we will soon be so starved for oil that ANWAR is certain to be plundered, and that nuclear plants are certain to sprout across the landscape like, well, like mushrooms. If Deffeyes is on or near target, nothing can prevent those developments.  Greens today should be using ANWAR and an expanded nuclear industry as bargaining chips, to be traded for strict CAFE standards, investment in renewable technologies, non-industry oversight of nuclear safety, and (since the near term alternative will be coal) investment in natural gas pipeline infrastructure.	2002-02-28
US	52084271	RW6ABKLXM4K0C	0374116792	669918674	Bright Earth: Art and the Invention of Color	Books	4	112	114	N	N	Diverting re-imaging of art history	Philip Ball presents us with the thesis that the coloring materials available to painters have constrained and inspired them down through the whole history of Western art, and that understanding how each of those materials appeared, and how artists and their patrons received them, has a surprising degree of explanatory power. <br />He amply supports this modest thesis. But fortunately for the reader, he is less interested in pushing a point than in telling a story. It's also a stroke of our good fortune that he rambles as he tells it. Ball is first of all an accomplished science writer, but his interests are very wide. Yes, he tells us all we need to know about the physics of light, and the inorganic and organic chemistry that have made the painter's palette steadily more vibrant with the passing centuries. He also gives us the technology behind the colors, and with this book as a key one might, if one had to, reconstruct many of the most important, and often closely guarded, color recipes of the ancients and the Old Masters. But he also limns the rise and fall of many of the strongest currents in Western art; painting's interaction with religion and commerce, and how its schools rose and fell and squabbled. Nor does he neglect philology; I loved learning where all those strange names on the tubes of oil paint come from.<br />The secret life of pigments is a rich subject, of which Ball has clearly made himself a master. Fascinating facts and boldly drawn connections tumble after one another, and there's not a single ounce of padding anywhere. <br />You'll learn what &quot;cobalt&quot; blue has to do with Kobolds: miners in Saxony who dug cobalt-zinc oxides for the color felt the ore to be in league against them with the wicked spirits of the mines, because it ate away their hands and feet if they weren't careful to keep them dry.<br />You'll learn why the Virgin Mary came to be dressed in blue; the tradeoffs a Renaissance artist had to make deciding whether to workin tempera, size, oils, or &quot;distemper&quot;; how old paintmakers' recipe books provide a Rosetta stone into some of the arcane symbolism of the alchemists; how the philosophical war between Florence and Venice over the relative virtues of color and line may have been influenced by Venice's shipbuilding industry; what Seurat was trying to accomplish with all those tiny dots, why he was able to attract an entire school of pointillists to his cause, and why it failed.<br />There are chapters on the physiology of color perception and the physics of color, on how colors deteriorate and what can and can't be done to restore them, on the invention and refinement of photography and color printing. But for all the byways he pursues, Ball never strays far from the thread of his main narrative: the accelerating pursuit of new materials, so that the colors on the physical surface can more brightly and accurately reflect the colors in the painter's mental eye. <br />It's worth noting that, compared to conventional pictures of art history, the one that emerges here is curiously foreshortened: since most of the colors on the palette have appeared since 1850, the Impressionists mark the midpoint of this version of the story.<br />There's so much here that almost every reader will find new and diverting ideas, whether their initial interest is in art, or in chemistry, or in cultural history. Not everything that dazzles illuminates; but &quot;Bright Earth&quot; does both.	2002-02-24

If you're not committed to the work and style of Boz, you may have a hard time getting through it.  It gets off to a very slow start; it wears its didactic aims more prominently on its sleeve than most of Dickens' novels do (the preceding novel, Martin Chuzzlewit, having been a study of the perils of greed, this one is likewise a study on self-destroying pride.) Its heroine is so self-sacrificing, uncomplaining, sweet and forgiving that a modern reader is likely to feel the impulse to throttle her more than once. I found it the least satisfying of the dozen Dickens novels I've read, and have rounded its three and a half stars up rather than down, in honor of all the other good stuff he's produced.<br />All that being said, the book contains plenty of rewards for the persevering. Dombie's daughter, the over-gentle Florence, is more than made up for by a string of sharply drawn women who are nobody's wallflowers: the peppery Susan Nipper, the fearsome landlady Mac Stinger, and the magnificent second Mrs. Dombey, whose inflexible, bent pride puts steel to her husband's flint as the story gains headway halfway through. The plotting is intricate and tight, the peeks into Victorian hypocrisies (never far removed from our own) are trenchant, and we are treated to what is possibly the most riveting death scene in the whole oeuvre, which Dickens chose to present from the decedent's point of view in a stream of consciousness passage as remarkable for its technical daring as its sentimentality.<br />Throw in the superbly menacing, dentally impeccable villain, Mr Carker, and a rogue's gallery of lesser despicables from the streetwise dunce Chicken, to the blustering toady Joe Bagstock, to the second Mrs. Dombey's outrageous tin magnolia of a mother, and it's a book you'd be happy to stumble across in the cabin some snowbound weekend.<br />The Oxford World Classics edition has an extremely useful set of notes, which includes in full Dickens' initial outline of the work.	2002-02-19
US	52084271	R3NL5SENDLDU6R	0679723161	636015448	Lolita	Books	5	9	10	N	N	One for the ages	In no sense is Lolita bedtime reading.  Only the wide awake need attempt it.<br />Vladimir Nabokov did not write novels.  He crafted jewels, star sapphires that seem at first to have hard, mechanical, intellectual surfaces. But as the attentive reader turns them over, noting the reflection of one facet in another, the fire in the gem's core ignites, warms the soul as well as the mind, and grows in value with each re-inspection.<br />Lolita is one of his crown jewels. He never wore his considerable heart on his sleeve, but he perhaps came closest in his afterword to this book, when he wrote of \\"what I shall bluntly call aesthetic bliss, that is a sense of being somehow, somewhere, connected with other states of being where art (curiosity, tenderness, kindness, ecstasy) is the norm.\\"  That credo is also the key to understanding the sense in which, despite Nabokov's contempt for \\"morality\\" in the censors' understanding of the word, there are deep moral underpinnings both of Lolita and of his whole body of work.<br />Humbert Humbert is a fabulous monster: an endlessly charming ogre, a dangerous pervert, a seducer as much of the reader as of the doomed and triumphant Lolita. The author has been generous to his dark creation, endowing him not only with erudition and wit, but - to run through the catalog - with genuine tenderness, with a capacity for ecstasy, and a wide ranging curiosity.  But he lacks all kindness, until it is far too late; and his curiosity has huge blind spots, that allow him neither to see his \\"darling\\" whole, nor to see the humanity in much of anyone else at all. <br />On a first reading, all his positive endowments nearly win us over to affection for Humbert. We are intended to fall into this trap, one which Humbert himself deconstructs with little clues along the way, and with nearly frank admissions of guilt at the end. On better acquaintance, none of his rationalizations or seductions work on us anymore. Nothing redeems him, because nothing can restore Dolly's stolen childhood. What transforms him from a mere monster into a human monster, and allows him to retain something like sympathy from the re-reader, is his act of writing the book. He becomes determined that, since he cannot give Lolita back her innocence or her lost time, he will give her the poorer gift of immortality.<br />Ultimately, besides being a love letter to America and the English language, \\"Lolita\\" is a poignant meditation on time, and immortality, and the connection of art to each. What has made Humbert into a monster is his drive to stop time, to catch and freeze the butterfly at the moment it emerges from the chrysalis. The other, simply human, characters differ from him in accepting time's flow. Let me give one example, out of dozens, of the way the theme surfaces.<br />For several chapters at the start, Humbert looks forward to a promised picnic with Lo and mother Charlotte on the beach at \\"Our Glass Lake.\\"  It's a mirage. When, finally, he gets to the beach, Lo is gone off to camp, Hum is stuck with Charlotte for company, and the lake's real name turns out to be \\"Hourglass.\\" A bait-and-switch has magicked his motionless, timeless, glassy idyll into a timepiece. He makes up his mind to drown Charlotte as they swim there, but can't bring himself to do it. When the two get back to shore, another beachgoer points out to Humbert that he's made the mistake of wearing his watch (a gift from Charlotte) into the water. She taps his wrist and announces, \\"Waterproof.\\"  Humbert may be forgetful of time, but he can't help taking it with him wherever he goes. And it keeps on ticking. Was it really her new husband's conscience, as he would have us believe, or was it Charlotte's being at home with fluid time that made her \\"waterproof,\\" despite his homicidal inspirations?<br />Dealing with one's reactions to Humbert can be unnerving, and may put off some readers who might otherwise have learned to appreciate Nabokov. I'd suggest starting with a (relatively) straightforward work like _Bend Sinister_, or _The Defense_, to get a feel for the kind of active reading that this author demands, and the delight he gives in return. If you like those, you will love Lolita, and you will eventually want to get the annotated edition from Vintage.<br />Five stars are not of course enough. I would like to award this book a sixth, grey star, outshining all the hosts of heaven.	2002-02-18
US	52084271	R131SMK265BM4E	0824707095	823239202	The Shape of Space (Chapman & Hall/CRC Pure and Applied Mathematics)	Books	5	64	64	N	N	Straight talk about curved space	What is the universe as a whole shaped like? Does it curve back on itself? Does it meet itself at the other side without curving?  Is its Flatland analogy a plane, or a sphere, or a doughnut, or a Klein bottle? What other, stranger geometries become possible with the added dimension? And if the universe has one of these exotic shapes, how could astronomers ever know for sure?<br />Jeffrey Weeks, a MacArthur (\\"genius grant\\") fellow and a consultant to NASA on cosmological observations, believes that there's no reason why a liberal arts student or a high schooler shouldn't be able to have a solid understanding of the answers to these questions, even though some of them are at the edge of research in cosmology and three-manifolds, and others have traditionally not been part of the math curriculum before graduate school.<br />The math is presented at an elementary level, but it is genuine mathematics. Readers in the intended audience must be prepared to roll up their sleeves; there are exercises, and there are formulas, and their minds will be stretched. But there are no prerequisites other than a little first-year algebra, and the discussion stays at a vividly concrete level, with a plethora of diagrams to aid the swelling imagination. High schoolers will benefit from some guidance getting through it; it's appropriate for undergraduate self-study.<br />More mathematically sophisticated readers, even those who've taken a course in algebraic topology or differentiable manifolds, will find the book a lively read, but will still probably learn a thing or two. I, for one, was startled to be shown a Moebius strip that was two-sided! (The trick is to embed it in a non-orientable three-space.)<br />The payoff is in the final two chapters, which detail programs of  astronomical observation that could well tell us the precise topology and geometry of the universe, and explain just how they would do it.  One chapter is devoted to a technique based on correlating distances betweengalactic clusters, and the other to a statistical search for correlated arcs of great circles in the cosmic microwave background. Both observations will probably be completed within the next decade. It's an exciting prospect.<br />Buyers note: I believe the Amazon characterization of this as a paperback is in error. I bought the second edition in hardcover at the same list price. In its (successful) attempt to avoid intimidation, it uses a large typeface, so it would fill out some 200 pages in a more typical math format.	2002-02-10
US	52084271	RS0OIAW5C82V6	0684827549	667246406	DARWIN'S BLACK BOX: The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution	Books	2	32	43	N	N	Nice and chewy, but alas! no beef	In this book, the anti-Darwinist crusade of the &quot;Intelligent Design&quot; creationists puts its best foot forward. Behe is disarming, because unlike most of his comrades in those trenches, he actually *likes* science, and he actually has and communicates a lively curiosity about the way the world works. Its content boils down to a &quot;God of the gaps&quot; argument; and such arguments have fared poorly in the past, because explanatory gaps do tend to get filled in.  But to Behe's credit, the gaps in our knowledge he pointed to were real ones, and raised some genuinely interesting questions. <br />Many of the book's early critics dismissed it too easily. Behe made this valid point: When Darwinists assert that natural selection - somehow or other - produced the kinds of complex molecular machinery Behe showcases, they are waving their hands just as hard as theists who assert that God - somehow or other - designed and installed that machinery. He went much too far in claiming to have demonstrated that natural selection cannot in principle have produced such effects, and his critics were right to call him on that claim. He would have done better to point out the parity - at least for now, and at the molecular level - of the two rival schemes of explanation, and then to present his rhetoricalcase (which many have clearly found persuasive) that the Darwinian scheme just doesn't feel as plausible.<br />Let me put my cards on the table here.  I am a Christian. I agree with Behe that the universe operates under the sovereignty of God; and that (despite Stephen Jay Gould's well-meaning attempt to carve out 'nonoverlapping magisteria') God intervenes causally in the world. I also agree with Behe that the universe is over ten billion years old, and that (as he says on p. 176) &quot;I believe the evidence strongly supports common descent.&quot; Particular infelicities of design, as Behe seems to acknowledge, also support the view that much of evolution has proceeded randomly. Finally, I also agree with Behe that nothing currently in the scientific record militates against the view that God has &quot;nudged&quot; evolution from time to time in a desired direction. Whether He actually chooses to intervene in that particular fashion, I frankly have no idea.<br />With all that agreement going in, I hoped for some fresh insight into how one might objectively determine when something is or is not &quot;designed.&quot;  I'd never seen anyone spell out an algorithm for that, but I didn't and don't see why in principle one couldn't be found.<br />My hopes were dashed. Mr. Behe gave it a valiant try, but he didn't manage to find one. His &quot;irreducible complexity&quot; isn't a reliable discriminator; it's not at all hard to describe scenarios under which old-fashioned random variation plus selection can produce systems Behe would call irreducibly complex. I thought of a few as I read, and many of his critics have given other examples.<br />A second thing I found disappointing was Behe's argument that, if it were possible to explain biological molecular systems X, Y, and Z with a natural-selection scenario, it would have been done by now, whereas no such explanations appear in the peer-reviewed literature.  In point of fact, in order to explain how one of his systems (say the dynamics of the cilium) has evolved, you'd need to have the following information:<BR>    (1) The complete genome of the organism, and of related organisms which do and do not have cilia (including those which have cilia-like structures that don't wiggle - and there are a lot of those around. The key word is centriole.)<BR>    (2) The complete proteome of those organisms, together with knowing all the proteins which are involved in the cilium, all the secondary functions of those proteins elsewhere in the cell.<BR>    (3) The stereochemistry of each of those proteins, how its function depends on its folding, and how all that would vary with variations in the genetic sequence encoding it<BR>    (4) All the proteins, in all of those organisms, which were identical or nearly identical for long stretches of the sequence, to the ones under study - each one of these being a candidate for playing a role in the intermediate steps.<BR>    (5) All of the genes which control expression and suppression of the genes involved in (1) through (4), and exactly when and how they come into play.<br />At the time that Behe wrote the book, only step (1) had been completed, and that only for a few bacteria, not for any of the organisms which he discussed.  There was absolutely no reason to expect *any* answers to his questions yet, except for wildly speculative ones.  Exactly the kind of loose speculations that aren't even considered for publication in peer-reviewed journals.<br />Finally, it was disappointing that Behe offered nothing at all in the way of a research program to help verify or falsify his views; or even anything to suggest how the research interests of a design-oriented biologist and a natural-selection biologist would differ.  (Well, maybe this: a natural-selection biologist might spend some time trying to figure out the genetic history of cilia, and clotting, and Behe's other &quot;irreducibly complex&quot; systems - that is, he would feel more free to undertake certain lines of research. Whereas the design-oriented biologist might avoid such research on the grounds that it couldn't be fruitful. So Behe's programme would be purely negative: to *avoid* certain kinds of research, whether for fear of wasting time or for fear of being proven wrong.)<br />I can't give Behe three stars today, because in the time since the book came out, he has spent his time sharing stages with a cavalcade of IRC Luddites who hate and fear science, who insist that the world is 6000 years old, that no species has ever evolved into another - things Behe knows perfectly well are falsehoods. He has never offered them a word of criticism. In this way, he has shown that it is not pursuit of the truth that matters to him, but lecture fees, or perhaps just applause from co-religionists. That makes flaws like his misrepresentation of Gould and Eldridge's views on p. 27 look less like sloppiness and more like dishonesty.<br />I'll still go for two stars, though, because &quot;Black Box&quot; did teach me a little biochemistry I hadn't known before. And though its conclusions overreach its arguments, it makes for a fluid and pleasant read.	2002-01-31
US	52084271	R2SJJ6FRN3G35F	0786867345	399419494	Carter Beats the Devil	Books	4	20	23	N	N	If vaudeville were this much fun, it'd still be alive	Great literature this isn't, but grand, smart, sure-footed entertainment it is. Glen David Gold takes his readers on a twisting, rocketing roller coaster ride, and he is in full command of his effects, from the moment we step into the car until the moment it pulls to a gentle stop and we begin to breathe again.<br />The blurbs and the opening pages contain some of the trappings of a murder mystery, in the matter of President Harding's untimely death and the puzzle of what role, if any, the world-famous magician Carter the Great had to play in it. In fact, I bought the book because I have a neighbor with whom I swap off murder mysteries every couple of months. It's not exactly a bait and switch, and the puzzle is eventually resolved, but it is a bit of misdirection. The Harding subplot forms the bookends, not the book. I found I didn't mind in the least.<br />What we really get is more of a Bildungsroman than a whodunit: the story of Charles Carter's induction into the realm of stage magic, and the arc of his career. Along the way, Gold fully immerses us in two worlds just distant enough from us to be wonderfully exotic: the world of vaudeville in the final days before it was killed off by the talkies, and the world of the San Francisco upper crust as the twenties were beginning to roar.<br />It's reminiscent of Michael Chabon's \\"Kavalier and Clay\\" in the way it makes us part of a small fraternity of hardscrabble entertainers in the golden age of a genre, and the way we get to feel the dirt of their trade under our fingernails. (As it happens, the two books have massively intersecting acknowledgment pages.) But it lacks the high seriousness of Chabon's work. <br />It's also reminiscent, of course, of Ragtime, in its re-creation of an era and its free mixing of real with fictional characters. But I liked this better than Ragtime or its host of imitators. Too large a part of the appeal of such books is the thrill of hobnobbing with celebrities. Of the many delightfullyparticular characters from real history in \\"Carter,\\" there are scarcely any I'd heard of before. Just the two aitches, Harding and Houdini. Okay, I did recognize Groucho Marx's incognito cameo, from a time before the brothers adopted their stage names, but most readers won't, and his scenes work just fine if they don't. Carter himself, his family, the rival madames of San Francisco's two classiest brothels, the teenaged inventor of television, the philanthropic borax king Francis Smith - they were all news to me. And none of the historicals is introduced to titillate the reader with a People Magazine fix; each is a pleasure to know in his or her own right, and each moves the storyline briskly along.<br />When Mr. Gold graces us with his second novel, I will definitely be standing in line for it.	2002-01-26

If you loved the Alienist, and were beguiled by its sequel, preserve your respect for Mr. Carr by ignoring this astonishingly banal and inept clunker. To call it a potboiler would be too high a praise; it's too tepid ever to have been near any kind of flame.<br />It's not the preachiness; novels about dystopias are supposed to preach, and Carr is dead on about the dangers of concentrated intellectual property rights, rampant public gullibility, and One World Government ruled from faceless boardrooms while the planet gasps its last.  These are serious concerns, that could have made for a riveting and thoughtful thriller. No, it's the fact that not one word of the book is remotely believable, the &quot;characters&quot; would have to add a dimension or two to achieve the flatness we expect from Danielle Steele, the pacing is both jerky and tired, and the style from beginning to end sounds like a failed entry in the Bulwer-Lytton purple prose contest. It's so phoned-in and mechanical it rarely even rises to the level of self-parody.<br />There is one and only one interesting thing about this Tom Swift and His Amazing Dooomsday Submarine knockoff: trying to figure out how someone with the talent and subtlety of Mr. Carr could possibly have written such a thoroughgoing turkey. One hint is that it began as a magazine serial assignment. But one would also have to postulate that Carr was under the impression that Time magazine is a penny dreadful from the twenties, one that would reject any manuscript which exceeded its minimum editorial expectations. Not likely.  So we unfortunates who read the thing are just left scratching our heads.<br />This is the first time I've found myself unable to finish reading a set of acknowledgements, because I kept wincing with vicarious embarrassment for each and every person in it.	2002-01-22
US	52084271	R1PNDHXI6ZDQU5	0716744732	95337721	The Power of Babel: A Natural History of Language	Books	4	260	263	N	N	Why language is silly putty	Deserts of scholarly prose aside, good books about language tend to come along in two types. One examines the human capacity for speech from the fertile perspective of Noam Chomsky's theories that transformed linguistics in the 1960s. Stephen Pinker's &quot;The Language Instinct&quot; is the premier example. The other type, over which Richard Lederer currently reigns, diverts us with the endearing foibles of English.  The first can be thought of as the molecular biology of language; the second is like Disney nature documentaries.<br />What's been missing is a good public account of the realm in between, corresponding to serious &quot;natural history&quot;, as McWhorter's title has it. Neither so abstract as to be buried in &quot;deep structure&quot; that precedes any concrete language, nor buried up to the neck in the myopic delights of trivia. McWhorter's subject is literal &quot;natural&quot; &quot;history&quot; too - the tale of how languages, left to themselves, die and are born, mutate, divide, and intertwine over time.<br />So &quot;Power of Babel&quot; is a welcome addition. It's style is lively, even downright breezy. Its numerous examples from languages of every continent but Antarctica are pithy and aptly chosen. Partly because McWhorter makes a series of distinct points, rather than building to a climactic conclusion, the pace may begin to drag halfway through.  That's fine; put it down for a while and read the latest Carl Hiassen thriller, or whatever else floats your boat. After a pause, this book ends as refreshingly as it began.<br />McWhorter notes that the way in which we are generally trained to think of languages has little in common with the way professional linguists think of them. What we take to be &quot;standard&quot; English, or French, or Russian are really anomalies. In each case, a dialect spoken by a very small population near a political center (London, Paris, Kiev and then Moscow) was elevated by fiat and then by the power of the pressinto &quot;the&quot; way to speak a &quot;language&quot; which had for centuries been a riot of equally correct, ever changing, barely mutually recognizable dialects. Thereafter political consolidation of nation-states based on a &quot;common language&quot;, together with literacy in vernaculars presenting schoolchildren with models of proper use of &quot;the&quot; language frozen onto the printed page, slowed the pace of linguistic change to a fraction of its natural rate. This has led laymen to think of the world as neatly divided into &quot;languages&quot;, each one spoken in only one proper fashion, almost any change to which amounts to a regrettable corruption. <br />McWhorter argues effectively to the contrary: that there are no languages, only dialects; that where two dialect communities border on one another, their speechways will mix indiscriminately, and that as long as language is transmitted to the next generation without the aid of recorded materials, major changes in vocabulary, pronunciation, and even grammar are par for the course, even within the space of half a century.<br />There's also a spirited debunking of the widely reported reconstruction of the &quot;proto-World&quot; language from which all others are supposedly descended. It's a valuable service, but its polemical tone is at odds with the lighter touch of the rest of the book, and McWhorter wisely relegates it to an &quot;Epilogue.&quot;<br />If specific foreign languages have ever fascinated you, whether or not you were any good at learning them (I certainly wasn't), you'll probably get the same kick out of &quot;Power of Babel&quot; that I did.	2002-01-18

And it's a sermon that's still needed, because no one else lays down quite the same moral that he does with such admirable consistency, and certainly no one makes it go down so smooth: live, savor, imagine, soar, remember, tremble; listen to the sounds that death, night, time, and dusk make; trust what your body tells you when its small hairs rise. <br />This book isn't Bradbury's finest work, but it builds on some of his finest work, and it is, thank goodness, more of the same.<br />The best volume he produced in his first decades was the beautifully unnerving short story collection, &quot;The October Country&quot;; and the best thing about that collection was the mini-cycle of three stories about the spooky, smoky Elliot Family. Bradbury always intended to extend that cycle to book length, and he added several stories to it over the years. Here, none too soon now that he's eighty, is the culmination of the project. It isn't really a &quot;novel&quot;; it's a sachet of short stories (most old and some new) with a strong family resemblance to each other, and a veil of lyrical connective tissue. The whole is no greater than the sum of its haunting parts. But why should it be? The Family was always evanescently and loosely bound, and it's proper for their stories to be woven together by spider strands rather than by the sturdy sinew of a plot.<br />Here and there the newer material is badly overwritten in the inimitable Bradbury style. But he never loses control of his mood or his themes. If you haven't read &quot;October Country,&quot; bypass this book and go directly to that heart of luminous darkness. But if you have, and you're looking for a fitting minor addition to the core Bradbury canon, &quot;From the Dust Returned&quot; won't disappoint.	2002-01-09

I needn't have worried. Though its protagonist is no slouch as a feminist, that wasn't among its several big flaws, and for me the flaws were comfortably outweighed by its rich rewards.<br />Taken sentence for sentence, almost all the writing is luscious. The author's love of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, and her sharp-eyed fidelity to its setting, time, and characters, is evident throughout. Only during the brief part of the novel actually taking place on the Pequod does Naslund attempt to replicate Melville's voice, or rather several of his voices, in a sequence of chapters in the form of soliloquies and playlets. That effort is as successful as it is amusing, but the remaining, non-Pequod, passages are kinder on the syntax-challenged 21st century reader than Melville was. <br />I loved the accurate period detail, on quilting and cooking and lightouse keeping, on blubber rendering and religious factions. I enjoyed the way the story flowed effortlessly along, but left plenty of Easter eggs for the alert reader to find. (What is the model in &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; for the ship Sussex? Why do the castaways throw their raincatching cups away before they are rescued? Why does Giles ask Una for her earring on the Alba Albatross?)<br />The first two thirds of the book has a powerful narrative drive, with vivid characters, robust suspense and dire catastrophes; powerful enough that the momentum carried me through the doldrums of the last third of the book, which meanders, and reads less like a novel than like the diary entries of some pleasant, progressive young 1840s matron with a penchant for name dropping. Naslund tries too hard to stuff the kitchen sink into those later chapters. And in the meantime we learn too little about the characters we came to care about in the first half, and Una seems too blithely unmarked by herearlier travails. For most of the book, I admired her resilience, but by the end I was wondering if past a certain point resilience doesn't become a character flaw.<br />For as long as the book maintains its fine first wind, Una emerges as a fit mate for Captain Ahab: as independent and blasphemous as he is (no accident, surely, that the novel contains exactly 666 pages!), but balancing his thundering &quot;No!&quot; to the Creator with a steadfast, sensuous &quot;Yes&quot; to the creatures. It's only in that sense that this novel takes a revisionist stance toward its great predecessor. Unfortunately, the flaccid last third of the book drains Una's &quot;yes&quot; of much of its credibility. Despite the promise of the early chapters, it fails to resonate at a mythic depth comparable to Ahab's &quot;no.&quot;<br />Still, it's a good read, and no more competent, more pleasurable, or more slyly appreciative a spinoff on Ahab's story is likely to come along in the next hundred years.	2002-01-01

Most of us will know that they stuck around longer than the dinosaurs did, and died out before Barney's kin put in an appearance. And that's about it. To see a whole book devoted to trilobites (but a book so slim as to guarantee it will not daunt) naturally stirs a hope that one may extend  one's long, arm's-length acquaintance to a kind of tentative intimacy.<br />By the time I was two chapters in to Fortey's book, I had grown pretty impatient. He was eminently readable, but the pace at which actual scientific information was being conveyed was glacial. It was as if he had spent a long life, most of it devoted to a passionate love affair with trilobites, trying to convey the flavor of his subject to literate, intelligent dinner companions with very short attention spans. The reader becomes one of those dinner companions. Fortey is an easygoing raconteur, never talking down to us and never wearying us with technical detail. By the time the book is over we've learned a fair amount about trilobites, quite a bit about their importance within the larger evolutionary scheme of things, and quite a bit about what it is like to be part of the small worldwide society of dedicated trilobite hunters.<br />Given how frustrated I was at the early pacing, it was a nice surprise to look back at the end and realize how much more I knew about these ancient arthropods than when I'd started. But among the many things I had expected to learn, and had not, were basic topics like: how does one actually go about liberating a specimen from the rock? What are the major orders of trilobites? If I'm looking at one, how do I begin to locate it within the classificatory scheme, or within the geological timeline? Where do I start reading if I want to learn more?<br />So if you want to while away the time with some engaging light scientific reading, this may be the book for you. If you want to persuade an initially indifferent friend to warm up to the idea of learning something about fossil invertebrates, this might be the book to lend out. But if you want to get a solid basic overview of the trilobite world, I can't help feeling there've got to be better places to go. Still, until I learn what those are, I'm happy enough to have gone to Fortey's book.	2001-12-27
US	52084271	R34W6WP2REE6WC	0520220218	773853531	What Is Life?	Books	4	32	33	N	N	So you thought you knew biology!	This book is an eye opener and a mind expander. As a science book for the general reader, I give it four stars; this is because Lynn Margulis is a maverick within biology today, and not all that she says is generally accepted science, and because its basic organizational principle, the division of living organisms into five kingdoms, is somewhat out of date. (Since the book came out in 1995, genetic data has made kingdoms subservient to the three &quot;domains&quot; of archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes.) For those with a more extensive background in biology, give it five stars for its capacity to open up broad new perspectives and to offer illuminating new details. <br />Lynn Margulis does not serve up any final answer to her title's question. There are a couple of ongoing themes: that wherever there is life, there is what she calls &quot;autopoiesis&quot;, the definition of a boundary between self and other, together with the absorption and expenditure of free energy to maintain the self. (A process, as she notes, which not only doesn't violate the second law of thermodynamics, but actually accelerates the rate at which overall entropy increases.) A second theme is, that life's self-organization goes on at progressively higher levels of integration: from cells to colonies and to symbiotic unions that make one complex cell out of several; from complex cells to multicellular animals, plants, and fungi; from multicellular beings to societies and ecosystems; from ecosystems to the biosphere. Margulis believes that biology impoverishes itself by insisting, as Steven Jay Gould does, that evolution has no &quot;direction,&quot; simply because no master designer is imposing a direction on it from outside.<br />But ultimately, according to Margulis, life can't be defined because it keeps on defining itself, and coming up with new definitions.  It is better to step back from our skewed view of primates and vertebrates as the most typical living beings, and look at the broadrange of specific ways of being alive that evolution and symbiosis have produced so far. So her book is largely organized into chapters describing the history and nature of each of the five kingdoms, in chronological order: bacteria, protoctists (single celled organisms with nuclei), animals, fungi, and plants. <br />Did you know that it takes two eggs and three sperm to make a flowering plant? That the cell walls of fungi are made from the same material as lobster skin? That photosynthesis evolved independently several times among bacteria? <br />As stimulating as the book's parade of facts about the wild profusion of ways of being alive is its parade of speculations: that cilia and flagella are the remnants of spirochete bacteria which took up residence in other cells; that the first fertilization event was the result of a failed attempt at cannibalism; that species-jumping genes from fungi taught flowering plants how to make fruit. Another startling hypothesis surfaces every few pages. Some of these speculations are seriously defended, some are tossed out for what they're worth, but they're all fascinating.<br />I do wish the footnotes had been more extensive. It would be good, for example, to read up on Kwang Jeon's ameba experiments, in which those amebas that didn't die of a bacterial infection wound up incorporating the bacterial genes - and after a few years of lab reproduction, became unable to survive without them. That experiment is the most vivid support Margulis gives for her thesis that genetic material continues to be regularly exchanged across kingdom boundaries; but it's not among the items for which she chose to provide citations.	2001-12-24
US	52084271	R1VT6IDB1KNW70	0553582747	255570129	From the Corner of His Eye	Books	3	5	6	N	N	Warm fuzzies trounce cold chills in overtime	First off, let readers of the paperback beware: the cover text badly misdescribes the substance of the book. The boy Bartholomew is not a principal actor in the book, and doesn't even get out of infancy until it's three quarters over. The protagonist is Bartholomew's extended and ever-extending family, and the false expectations led me - and apparently quite a few other reviewers - to read the book with a nagging sense of its not having started yet, even halfway through. That could make an already long book seem to drag out longer.<br />That part isn't Koontz's fault. He is answerable for the oddly clipped and almost phoned-in ending, but that won't spoil the loyal fan's reading pleasure up until that point. It seems as if what he really wanted to do was write two novels - one a fairly straight thriller about the dire villain Enoch Cain and his band of opponents; and another, in the Lew Padgett tradition, about that coming race of quantum-mechanical wonder children of which Bartholomew and Angel form the advance guard. He realized his first novel was running long, so he truncated the second one into a few chapters at the end, and wound up telling it badly.<br />Enoch Cain is a marvellous villain, up there with Koontz's best. He is a colorful incarnation of the notion of the banality of evil, a Philistine who fancies himself refined, a sociopath whose only special power is the audacity and unpredictability he inherits from a bloated ego. He is a buffoon with bite, a sad sack out of deSade, all the more dangerous because he is bound to be underestimated.  The wunderkind storyline, on the other hand, is pretty sorry stuff as science fiction; there's no indication that Mr. Koontz has the slightest real understanding of the quantum theory he bandies about.<br />One of Koontz's great strengths as a storyteller has always been that he is as fascinated by goodness as he is by evil. In almost all his novels, and in all the better ones, the good characters form a community, abubble of warmth and safety that affords a pleasing narrative contrast against the cold horrors with which they are confronted. In _Corner of His Eye_, he devotes an unusual degree of space and energy to creating a larger than usual cozy space, inhabited by more than half a dozen characters. The difference between the five-star and the one-or-two star reviews of this book, I think, lies in the readers' reactions to this safety zone of heroes.<br />The ex-priest Vanadium, spiced up fortunately with a certain sadistic streak of his own, is too omniscient to be believable. With that exception, I think the reviewers who suggest the good guys here are too good to be true are wrong. Take a look around, and you'll find plenty of people just as saintly as this book's crew. And I for one found the crew endearing, individual, and well drawn. What you probably won't find in the real world, and what makes reading about this and other Koontz side-of-the-angels leagues an escapist treat (and for would-be sophisticates a guilty pleasure) is the way the good guys instantly recognize, trust, and bond with one another.  <br />In summary: If you enjoy Koontz mainly for suspense, pass this one by;  if you enjoy him as a practitioner of the modern morality tale, give it a fourth star and give it a whirl, but don't expect much from the ending.	2001-12-12
US	52084271	R2O3PNYYZD6BP4	0385313667	190979319	Total Recall (A V.I. Warshawski Novel)	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Series builds up a fresh head of steam	Of the triumvirate of not so ladylike lady gumshoes who frequent the best seller lists, V.I. Warshawski is the clear standout. Neither as histrionic as Kay Scarpetta has come to be, nor as cartoonish as Kinsey Milhone can become on off days, V. I. has flaws (chiefly a propensity for suffering fools all too testily) and virtues (chiefly a reliable but restrained adult capacity for empathy) which are life sized. So are the villains she finds and foils, from the boardrooms and back streets of the real world, not a one of them in competition for the crown of a Jason or a Manson. These are detective stories for grownups, more in the world-weary tradition of Lew Archer than the bust-em-up school of Travis McGee.<br />This outing is particularly gripping, probably the series' best since Burn Marks. If you're not already initiated into the pleasures of Paretsky, you don't want to start here. Although it's self contained, you'll enjoy this book more if you already know and admire V.I.'s friend Lotty Herschel from previous volumes. This is the book in which the air of secrecy and trauma hovering over Lotty from the time of the Holocaust is finally put on center stage and explained.<br />Along the way, you'll be treated to a set of interlocking puzzles that keep our heroine bouncing kinetically from one twist to the next; you'll tangle, without resolution, with some of the contentious issues surrounding recovered memory. And you'll meet with Paul Radbuka, who is that rare bird in mystery stories, an unforgettably vivid character who is neither the villain nor the hero nor (exactly) a victim.<br />(I'd like to award four and a half stars; I reserve five for books that lay claim to multiple rereadings.)	2001-12-03
US	52084271	R2YKN6F6GHMXTU	0195148274	374461801	Supreme Injustice: How the High Court Hijacked Election 2000	Books	5	9	15	N	N	The rule of law endangered	During the dizzying, passion-ridden days of the December post-election, I adopted a mantra that I chanted to conservative and liberal friends alike. I reasoned, Bush isn't trying to steal the election, and Gore isn't trying to steal the election. You can only steal what belongs to someone else. Florida belongs to neither candidate; it's an unresolvable, statistical dead heat. My mantra was: you can't steal a tie.<br />I was wrong, and Alan Dershowitz's lively, sober, closely argued book explains (among other things) exactly why I was wrong. The election belonged neither to Bush nor Gore; neither could steal it.  But the election did belong to the voters, and to the processes spelled out in the Constitution. The five members of the Supreme Court majority in Bush v. Gore stole the election from the voters, and from the framers of the Constitution. <br />The tie could have been resolved in any of a number of ways. It could have been resolved by the state court, adjudicating state law. It might have been resolved by recognition of the fact that the majority of those who voted, cast ballots for Gore. It could have been resolved by mandate of the state legislature. It could have been resolved by the votes of the members of the U.S. House of Representatives.  All those would have fit within the constitutional framework, all of them would have made the tie-breakers accountable to the electorate, and most of them would have resulted in a Bush presidency.  But in the event, it was resolved by the one sole body to which the Constitution assigns no role in presidential elections - the Supreme Court.  A body appointed for life, and unaccountable for its subversion of the Constitution.<br />Further, as Dershowitz makes painfully clear, the Supreme Court made their decision purely on the basis of their own political preference, and perhaps of their own personal gain. They deliberately made their decision _ad hoc_, setting it entirely outside the framework of the law.  They defieda large body of legal precedent - including their own most constantly held &quot;judicial philosophies.&quot;  They appealed to no legal precedents. Plainly ashamed of what they were doing, and alarmed at the lawless precedent they were setting, they wrote into their decision the astounding assertion that the principles they pretended to apply should never be applied in the same way again, and never bothered to offer the slightest rationale for this kind of &quot;this case and this case only, now and forever&quot; decision.<br />Dershowitz makes an ironclad case that this was the most corrupt decision ever made by the U.S. Supreme Court. He tentatively suggests some steps we could take to help avoid a repeat of this ignominy - steps that will almost assuredly not be taken in the absence of a great public outcry for them.<br />Professor Dershowitz has devoted his life to the law; he is bound to take an optimistic view of where we go from here. But the chilling thing about Bush v. Gore is that it does set a precedent - for the proposition that the Supreme Court may impose its political will without concern for the web of precedents set and followed which is the very definition of the Rule of Law. This time, the five in the majority felt that they needed the cover of a virtual tie before exercising such an unappealable judicial fiat. Next time - especially if their numbers are strengthened by more hypocritical ideologues of the sort Bush has announced he wants to appoint - they may grow bolder.<br />Our only defense against such a scenario is an informed and aroused electorate. The Republic owes a great debt to Mr. Dershowitz for giving us this rousing handbook of essential information.	2001-07-30

This book is Ms. Greeley's account of the year it happened to her.  <br />The story is told in a fast-paced and engaging style, and it is a great read as a tale of academic adventure. But it is also the story of a group of middle school students who learned deep and surprising lessons, and the reader learns along with them: the intangibles at the core of a really good education that no test will ever be able to measure, the difference between a &quot;values education&quot; that teaches *about* values, and one that provides a hands-on engagement with lived values learned in real time. <br />Above all, it provides a model, concrete and down to earth rather than airily utopian, of how the pious adult slogan of &quot;no child left behind&quot; can take on flesh and bone; how the determination to leave none of the others behind can become the real social cement that binds a classroom of students to each other, and to the enterprise of learning.   This book flies in the face of the current conventional wisdoms that make education a matter of pouring a sufficient quantity of sufficiently standardized facts into the inert heads of students. But it is presented with such freshness and clarity, so free of educatorese or political cant, so focused on walking, talking, breathing children, that even the most ardent proponents of schools as efficient knowledge factories are likely to find themselves disarmed.	2001-07-10

I can appreciate her eclectic choice of illustrations, too (with Dore doing service for Dante near the end.) As a child, from kindergarten through middle school, I only knew that I could spend hours with these volumes every weekend, and always find something fresh and exciting there. And that I would be left thirsty for more - pointed beyond the Book House itself to Pyle and Stevenson, to Dickens and Thackeray and Shakespeare.<br />It's a pity and a wonder that after serving American kids over half a century of publication, this cornucopia of pleasure and enlightenment ever went out of print.	2001-05-31
