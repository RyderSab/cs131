It's on the coffee table, where it can be admired and browsed by family and visitors, or maybe just by me when I am in the mood to look at gorgeous pictures of garden produce and dream about next year's crop. <br /> <br />This book is obviously geared to the rank novice gardener (And where, I ask you, does it claim otherwise?).  I am unlikely to use Kitchen Garden A to Z as a reference because I am an intermediate level home gardener who has managed to grow every category of vegetable and herb mentioned in this book.  If I were a beginner, however, I would find this book to be indispensable for my starting information and pure inspiration to get going.  It would be easy to find whatever I was looking for with the oversized page titles laid out A to Z, on the side edge, graphic-stylish. I would also be awed at the lovely diversity of tomatoes, melons, squash, etc. which I almost never see in my grocery store.  The pictures are impeccable and artistically shot, and they feature several varieties and stages of growth for each crop being examined on the spread. The information is short and useful, but doesn't go into much detail; for instance, in the Pumpkin spread under \\"harvest\\" it simply says to leave the handle on, cut when the fruit is mature and let cure in the sun for a week.  Nothing about thumbnail testing the shell first or whether it should cure on the ground or somewhere else, and if it can be left on the vine for awhile or not.  Oh well, most people will do okay with this so I suppose one shouldn't get too picky about short text. <br /> <br />I am grateful that in the first section (which takes up nearly half the book) there is more explanation about how to garden generally and an emphasis on how to do it organically.  A first-timer would have been thoroughly primed on how to lay out their garden depending on available sun and how much they could realistically handle.  It also shows superb examples of beautiful and clever vegetable gardens above and beyond typical row-style.  Beginners will be able to start out right after reading this book and they will have every chance of productive and satisfying crops.   <br /> <br />But I still like it mainly for the pictures:). <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle <br />	2005-08-30

Great way to start quilling!	Ever found yourself rolling up odd bits of paper, cinema ticket stubs, food wrappers, etc. in a moment of distraction?  Well this is your lucky day my friend; you could put that undiscovered skill to use in an old art form known as quilling. Want a fast greeting card?  A clever gift package tag decoration?  A cute accent in your memory book?  Something to frame and hang on your wall? Quilling will do the job nicely while impressing the heck out of your friends and it's just plain *easy*.  Really!  Once you see the simple diagrams in the step-by-step photo layouts you'll be asking yourself why you never thought to do this yourself. <br /> <br />In a nutshell, you take various lengths of narrow, colored paper strips, twirl them tightly around a special quilling tool (or a toothpick, or a stick pin if you're really advanced) and glue them down in various configurations to make artistic shapes.  You could form realistic looking flowers, birds, bugs, an alphabet of letters, and even cartoony animals. Talk about a cheap hobby, especially if you take the time to cut your own strips of paper. Or, just make them by running them through a paper shredder. <br />  <br />Twirled Paper is one of those Klutz kit books that has everything you need to get started on quilling, or \\"paper twirling\\" as Klutz calls it.  Here's what is included with the book:  a lot of colorful narrow paper strips, a quilling tool, glue and several googly eyes (for the animals you'll make). The book itself is a practical spiral-bound to lay flat, the pages are made out of that slick wipe-clean type cardstock.  After a simple section on pinching and finger shaping your coils, you're off to things like fish, UFOs, cats and flowers.  I have to say, Klutz made this book fun and upbeat to appeal to kids 8 years old through teens, but if I were just starting out now as an adult I'd be enjoying this very much and use a lot of these designs in my own greeting card projects.  I don't think I'll be able to let my kid have it when he turns 8 next year!:) <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle <br />	2005-08-24
US	50986119	R3LQMXVFIBLO2D	1592573134	358608467	The Complete Idiot's Guide to Quick and Easy Low-Carb Meals	Books	4	16	16	N	N	Useful, delightful, but not strictly LOW carb recipes	Along comes another LC cookbook, sayeth the powers at Amazon, and lo I buy and test; for such is the compulsion of the dieting reviewer. <br /> <br />Not normally someone to pick up the books with titles that suggest I may have lower-than-average intelligence (guilty conscience perhaps?), nevertheless I couldn't resist the allure of \\"quick and easy\\". Tod Dimmick has written a cookbook that promises several things in the introduction: <br />* Use high-quality, low-carb ingredients <br />* Keep it simple <br />* Call for accessible ingredients <br />* Avoid processed foods <br />* Take advantage of quick cooking methods <br />* Keep an eye on saturated fat <br />* Control expense <br />* Add in fun and flavor <br />My job, as I see it, is to test how well these promises are carried out by actually performing the recipes in my average home kitchen. This time I tried four appetizers, three breakfasts (aside from the ever-present omelet recipes that *every* LCCB has, and which I am tiring of rapidly; besides, it's hard to mess up a basic egg/meat/veggie recipe if your cooking method is good), two seafood main courses,  a meat loaf, a kid-friendly chicken dinner, a salad  and three dessert selections.  Additionally, there were a few dozen recipes that were so similar to recipes from other LCCBs that I didn't even need to try them yet again to know exactly how they would turn out - simple and classic dishes that are universally LC, like grilled steak with seasonings, wine, and butter or roasted veggie side dishes.  In all, I feel confidently familiar with at least half of the recipes in TCIGTQ&ELCM.   <br /> <br />My verdict:  this book lived up to its promises, mostly.  There were few enough ingredients, easy to understand instructions, and everything was fresh, unprocessed, inexpensive and accessible at my supermarket.  Vegetables were emphasized in most main dish recipes, putting an end to the myth that LC means lacking nutrition and variety. There was a lot of leeway in choosing cuts of meat based on personal preference and budget.  Nearly everything had a built-in guarantee of good flavor because that is what you get when you use a very few fresh, unprocessed ingredients in simple recipes that call for quick cooking methods. Looked at that way, it's hard for this cookbook to fail. <br /> <br />As for being low carb, my impression is that about half of the overall recipes were truly a traditional, Atkins-style low carb, the other half is what might be called \\"good carb\\", of the kind that you might find on a South Beach diet, for instance.   I suppose that somebody on a \\"good carb\\" type diet would have no trouble with the low carb dishes, but a traditional Atkins dieter would have to stay away from the \\"good carb\\" recipes for sure. Some high-carb fruits were called for frequently in the breakfast and dessert sections: also, unprocessed bran was used as a substitute for many starchy things including bread crumbs, and while that's okay for some LC diets, it's troublesome for Atkins and Paleo diets.  That does limit a strict low-carber severely, and it was a little disappointing to me, given the title that promised *low* carb.  I just wish that the Good Carb and Low Carb recipes were marked as such.  <br /> <br />I can sincerely rave that I loved what I tried (exceptions:  anything that tried to imitate bakery items that are normally made with wheat flour.  The pancake and cookie recipes blew chunks IMHO.  Sorry Mr. Dimmick, but soy flour and other LC bake mixes just don't taste right).  Even where it wasn't terribly original, this cookbook can't be faulted for taking advantage of the tried-and-true.  Sometimes all I needed was a reminder that yes, stuffed peppers can be translated low carb, and that Oh yeah, classic salsa and hot artichoke dips are ready-made as low carb.  What can I say, there is a fine line between Id__t and genius. <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle <br />	2005-06-18
US	50986119	R2YIQSUFMLC3HA	0671578510	862976515	Telzey Amberdon	Books	5	8	8	N	Y	A nostalgic trip to the future that still inspires me!	As a female who has appreciated SF/F since the age of twelve, I have been in a very small minority for most of my life.  Along came validation in the form of Telzey Amberdon, the Nancy Drew of Science Fiction for her day, and suddenly I felt that I had a place in our speculative future.<br /><br />Telzey is cool.  Telzey is brilliant, beautiful, and a very independent-minded fifteen-year-old; and apparently, also a powerful latent psi (psychic).  She's the genius daughter of some powerful politicians several hundred years into the future when humanity had expanded into the stars and founded homes on countless planets in a system called the Hub. Somehow our intrepid heroine ends up getting pulled into several mysteries and thrillers during the course of this book, and of course she handles herself with wit and self-confidence against the universe's fiends, human and non-.  But the worst threat to this budding psi is the ever-watchful Psychology Service, which has its own agenda for her powerful talents even as it purports to protect and serve all the citizens of the Hub. Telzey has to learn a lot of psychic self-defense on the fly against her own in addition to everything else on her plate.<br /><br />This is a collection of the short novellas that Schmidt wrote at various points in his career for magazines, and as such they had to be combined to make a novel hefty enough for publishing by today's standards.  I rather enjoyed this format, as Telzey's character can be explored in chunks of chronological development rather than skimmed as one would through the plot of a larger novel.  It works well on the level of light entertainment and gave me more natural reading breaks than the standard Chapter format.<br /><br />I was also appreciative of the slightly retro flavor of stories that were written mostly during the `60s and `70s.  Now and then an anachronism caught me off guard, such as a reference to a rotary dial-up communication system.  But in many ways Schmidt was so ahead of his time, with the subtly feminist flavor of his themes and main characters, that I can gloss over those tiny lapses without skipping a beat. Mostly, I just have fun exploring this speculative future through Telzey.<br /><br /> Gosh I enjoyed getting back into the Hub universe; now I want more.  Happily there are more Telzey stories out there, and soon I will be reacquainting myself with all of them and some others I had never met.  It's good to live in the age of Internet bookstores!<br /><br />-Andrea, aka MerribelleSchmidt was so ahead of his time, with the subtly feminist flavor of his themes and main characters, that I can gloss over those tiny lapses without skipping a beat.

Books	5	198	200	N	Y	The essence of convenience, nutrition and soul satisfaction	Dana Carpender has made a serious study of adapting classic recipes from around the world to work with modern low carb diets.  In this latest offering, 200 Low-Carb Slow Cooker Recipes, she proves once again that you don't need refined grains and sugars to enjoy healthful, satisfying food - no matter your culinary traditions or meat of preference.  The key is quality ingredients, simply prepared. <br /> <br /> <br />Dana Carpender is a believer in keeping it simple and freshly prepared whenever possible.  None of the ingredients were hard to find at my supermarket except perhaps the low-carb imitation honey that shows up in a few recipes.  Of the dozen or so main dish recipes I tested in 200 LCSCR I can honestly say that seven were big hits with my family, a few were just okay and just one was bad.  All of them cooked on time and just as predicted. There were some very satisfying desserts toward the end, with several variations on cheesecakes and custards that turn out splendidly in my slow cooker.  Although I do not normally have a use for appetizer recipes, there is even a section for that - which contains an outstanding hot artichoke dip. <br /> <br />I am impressed with the author's diligence in keeping most recipes under 10 grams of net carbs per serving. Dana really does stick to the universal \\"rules\\" of low carb dieting; lots of veggies and meats, occasional artificial sweetening, a sprinkling of fruits now and then and a bare representation of grains and sugars  -- and only when absolutely necessary for flavor, never as filler.  She is good at innovating more nutritious subs for common starchy side dish ingredients; fauxtatoes (cauliflower) and mashed turnips are big players at her low carb table.  Eat the 200 LCSCR way and you will probably have better, more varied natural nutrition than ever before in your typical American diet. <br /> <br />The recipes for lc condiments & sauces are a big bonus to those of us who suffer from sticker shock at the supermarket's low carb pricing practices. Readers of her other lc recipe books may find some of these items familiar, but hey, it is convenient to have them all in one place. And as for convenience, well...slow cooking is the essence of convenience to modern time-challenged dieters.   <br /> <br />Did I make it sound as if this book is one of the best kept secrets for low carbers?  I hope so, because it is.   <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle.  <br />	2005-06-13
US	50986119	R2X5FYWX3CMVHS	0789480212	988227696	The New Encyclopedia of The Cat	Books	5	27	27	N	Y	Comprehensive and easy to reference, plus it's lovely!	<br />The New Encyclopedia of the Cat should come with a warning for readers who might be susceptible to falling for the charms of cats.  I wasn't able to help myself; after reading it for about one hour, I was having visions of collecting a perfect specimen of each breed that caught my eye...but I only have room for two felines in my humble abode.  Crashing back down to reality was a bit heartbreaking. <br /> <br />This does start out with a large section that does indeed resemble a real encyclopedia.  There is info on the history of cats, pics of ancient paintings and artifacts, etc., followed by sections on practical cat care and current issues such as indoor vs. outdoor.  All very valuable and thorough.  But that's not really why we're buying this book, now is it? <br /> <br />This book is lavish with cat photos.  We're talking lots and lots of pictures of every imaginable cat breed, full body shots that have been cut away from their distracting backgrounds and set upon a field of pure white so that the reader can appreciate their forms and finer points.  Don't think it's just a boring text book, however;  everything is laid out with graphic finesse, to be visually interesting and attractive as you digest the tidbits of information that have been artfully placed throughout each breed spread.  You just can't make a better choice if you're looking for a gift for a cat lover or perhaps doing research into your own future pet possibilities. <br /> <br />What I loved best about TNEotC was the \\"snapshot\\" of breed profiles on each spread.  You can look up Abyssinian for instance and see a little 2x3 box insert:   <br />Date of origin: 1860s <br />Place of origin:  Ethiopia <br />Ancestry:  Ethiopian household and street cats <br />Outcross breeds:  none <br />Other name:  Color names vary internationally <br />Weight range:  9-17 lbs <br />Temperment:  attention-demanding <br />Breed Colors: etc, etc, (with tiny sample coat color insets.  But of course full photos ofall acceptable variations are also pictured on the larger spread.) <br /> <br />There are even symbols that will tell you how much grooming is required, how vocal the cat is, and how sociable it is.  You can get a very quick idea of a cat's likely disposition, maintenance, etc. from this very handy little box. <br /> <br />TNEotC is truthfully the best, most thorough listing of cat breeds I have ever found.  More pages are reserved for the most popular breeds, such as Siamese and Persians, but by no means is TNEotC skimpy on the obscure ones.  They even include full spreads on \\"newcomer\\" breeds like Pixiebobs and Bengals - not just passing mentions as in other cat guides.  In fact, TNEotC is the only one that devotes full attention to Chartreux as a separate breed in its own right; this is sort of a litmus test of mine, because those cat books that lump Chartreux with British Shorthairs are generally lost on the whole concept of being definitive.  We cat lovers enjoy lots of detail on cats, pure and simple. <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle <br />	2005-05-29
US	50986119	R24T93FMHDADMH	1845104773	829204366	Speedy Little Race Cars	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Preschoolers everywhere will love this book.	Speedy Little Race Cars is a short, rhyming story about a car race through a town and a scenic countryside. The illustrations are very simplified and colorful - they remind me of those Lego toys.  Nine race cars, each a different color, start out on the mark and race along the track to the finish line.   Along the way, the cars each makes a mistake that gets it taken out of the race, such as running out of  gas or sliding on an oil spill.  After the final car gets to the end an electronic sound card is activated that sounds like race car engines roaring - the cars all want to start a new race. <br /> <br />This is one of those board books with three dimensional objects (in this case they're race cars, but I've seen similar ones with ladybugs, frogs, etc) fixed on the pages.  The pages on top of the cars have shaped cutouts positioned so that when the book is closed everything lies flat.  You open the first page, read, turn, and a car magically disappears.  Each turn of the page removes one more car until there's only one left - the winner of course. <br /> <br />Much to my surprise, this book has held up very well in the two months we have owned and read it to my 3 year old; the pieces haven't broken off, the pages are like new and the sound chip still works fine.  And let's be honest here, that more than anything else is what appeals to my boys, the rewarding engine sounds at the end of the story.  As a parent I enjoy the fact that this is the quickest, easiest bedtime read on our bookshelf.  A can't-miss choice for the little ones, esp. those who are into cars and other noisy gadgets. <br />Andrea, aka Merribelle <br />	2005-05-07

This gift from my mother in law for my son sat unused on the shelf for about 2 years before he discovered it at the age of 6.  Now suddenly it's the favorite \\"toy\\"; dragged to school, on short car trips across town and kept close during every spare moment at home.  He knows instantly how to find his favorite spreads on the alligator snapping turtle and the crocodile skulls - invaluable for impressing his friends, teachers and complete strangers.  This book inspired a very keen interest, to say the least! <br /> <br />Yes, the Eyewitness series is *technically* for an older reading level but they still make  good picture books for younger kids because the pictures are visually stimulating  and graphically laid-out on a plain white background (non-distracting). The information is also broken up into small groups of text next to specific photos or illustrations, arranged interestingly around the page.  When a picture sparks his interest I can read about that item to my son and leave out other items until he's ready to explore further.  In this way, our one-spread-per-night \\"story\\" time stays fun for his young mind without being overwhelming.   <br /> <br />Just for example, the spread on Turtles and Tortoises starts with a technical definition in the main body, then the \\"tidbits\\" of info spread around the rest of the space give interesting anecdotes about their shells, common and uncommon species, turtle mythology, the largest turtle on record and Lonesome George, the last giant Galapagos island tortoise.  Just enough educational material upon which to start research for a school paper, but not so much that it becomes discouraging. <br /> <br />What it all comes down to is, this book impressed me so much that I will be ordering several other of the Eyewitness series books as my kids grow, both for their enjoyment and as good reference materials for school.  Excellent! <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle <br />	2005-05-04

You see, although I did grow up with cats this kitten would be our first family pet ever.  I wanted to treat it as though we were expecting a new baby: after all, a cat could be part of our family for two decades! <br /> <br />After you eliminate all the kids' cat books that are too technical and wordy to make effective storytime tales, you end up with a scant handful that are appropriate for kids in my boys' age range.  The Little Kitten won out because it had adorable, timeless photos and an easy-to-digest story about a little kitten growing up on a farm with his owner, a little girl names Jenny.  No lectures about do's and don't's, how many shots they need, what kind of food or litter - just typical everyday things that kittens do, like climbing up into places they can't get down from and what sorts of toys they like.  I found that the Little Kitten rang very true to real life.  This book teaches with a story and leaves the feeding schedule and litterbox cleaning for older kids and parents to learn about somewhere else.  It was just what we needed.   <br /> <br />There are other books in the Random House Pictureback series, which I thumbed through in the bookstore; the little duck, the little puppy, the little rabbit, etc.  They all seem to have a similar theme and structure to the plot, with a simple message about how to play with and treat these pets everyday.  I would definitely get any one of these other Pictureback pet books someday when we decide to get other types of pets.   <br /> <br />One caveat - in the very last picture, the \\"punchline\\" if you will, shows the kitten walking through tall grass with what appears to be a balloon with a string tied to the kitten.  Common sense should tell adults that this is hazardous to any small animal, even though it was cute in the story, and I advise adults reading this book to kids to make a point of explaining that to kids.  Otherwise, The Little Kitten is a very solid recommendation. <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle <br />	2005-05-02

This book was bought as a family Christmas present last month.  I thought that my boys, ages 3 and 6, would like it but jumpin' jimminy, it's become their favorite bedtime book. <br /> <br />Basically, you have a riddle on one side of the page that gives a few hints about the creature, and then you press the color-coded button on the bar below.  The creature's sound is called and the child can try to guess its name.  Then he can pull a tab on the opposite page to reveal a hidden picture of the night creature.  Another flap under the riddle has more information. <br /> <br />My six year old cannot get enough of this.  After we'd only read the book through a few times he started to play \\"guess this sound\\" games with me.  He has all 10 creature calls memorized, as well as a lot of facts on each one.  How many kids today know what a whippoorwill is, much less what it sounds like?  As far as I'm concerned, Night Sounds is the perfect example of how to make learning both fun and effective for children. <br /> <br />I am planning on getting Bird Sounds and Safari Sounds (the other two books in this series) based on the tremendous enjoyment we have gotten out of Night Sounds.  Fabulous teaching tool and a highly recommended family read-aloud book. <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle. <br />	2005-01-09

This holiday season is the perfect time to start thinking about what to give those people to whom you want to express a little appreciation but for whom you don't want to make uncomfortable with anything too deluxe (next door neighbors, kid's teacher, postal carrier that actually smiles and knows your name, brother-in-law's girlfriend, etc).  You might also need ideas for add-on gifts if you are giving somebody a bit closer a kitchen-related gadget.  Gifts In A Jar is a great solution for those Under Five Dollars is Appropriate occasions.   <br /> <br />The deal is, you layer ingredients into a wide-mouth, quart sized jar according to the order listed so that they stay separate and the presentation is pretty.  Seal, top off the jar with ribbons or fabric and tie a preprinted tag to the rim that has baking instructions.  You cut these tags directly from the book; there are six for each recipe.  These mixes are supposed to stay fresh from 3 to 6 months, but I assume that a lot of that depends on how fresh the maker's ingredients were before being added to the jar.  A hint for the wise:  use the freshest possible nuts, dried fruits and spices or your recipient will open the jar a month from now to find it rancid, crystallized and/or faded.  This is after all supposed to be delightful and delicious. <br /> <br />Now this is my second venture into the Gifts in a Jar series and all my expectations were exceeded this time around.  Apparently the author was paying attention to the comments of previous customers (from the GIAJ Muffins book, an earlier contribution) who complained about the prevalent use of Bisquick, because I have yet to run into an ingredient in this book that asks for anything but scratch.  And every one of the 10 recipes I have tested turned out either decently or downright fabulous.  Standouts:  Pumpkin Chocolate Cake, Peach Cobbler, Chocolate Coffee Cake, and Peach Crumb Cake.  I only tried the one peach cobbler recipe (there is rhubarb and blueberry too), but the others look similar and I  must say it was the best I've ever had. <br /> <br />I have one issue with the author(s) of the recipes.  About half of them require several additional ingredients that the recipient must provide when s/he makes the cake or cobbler.  Obviously \\"wet\\" ingredients like eggs, oil and fruit fillings can't be put into the jars but when the recipient has to add her own sugar, baking soda, corn starch etc. in addition to these I think it gets to be a little too much.  Isn't the idea to be giving a gift of *convenience*, not a hassle?  So I have marked the recipes in my book that I feel are appropriate as gifts and once in a while I test in my own home the ones that have too many other requirements to be true gifts. Eleven useable gift recipes make this book well worth the price still. <br /> <br />Good for bake sales too.  Solidly recommended. <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle <br />	2004-11-18

Thanksgiving, A Harvest Celebration is a fine example of how to teach history to kids through storytelling.  This is one of those illustrated books that could be read aloud like a story to younger children, but also suitable for a 10 year old reader.  The style and difficulty level is about similar to the American Girl books, although a bit shorter. <br /> <br />This book tells the story of the Pilgrims' first year in America through the eyes of a fictional girl, Ellen Chilton.  We learn about the voyage across the ocean, the establishment of a colony and the bitter hardships that these people faced throughout their first winter.  Then we meet the Native Americans through Ellen, get a glimpse of how they taught the colonists valuable survival skills and befriended them.  Finally, we witness the celebration at Harvest time, in which the people all came together to feast in gratitude to God for His provision and protection. <br /> <br />Thanksgiving, A Harvest Celebration is one of those rare modern kids' Thanksgiving books that doesn't get sappy or cartoony; we see a realistic portrayal of likely historical events, both joyful and sad, although on the other hand we are spared the more gruesome details that would be cause for concern in a children's book.  And here's something else you don't see much of nowadays V direct acknowledgement to God as the \\"reason for the season\\" so to speak.  God was, after all, a big factor in the Pilgrims' decision to come to America in the first place as well as their sustainer throughout.  \\"Thanksgiving\\" is the name of the harvest feast celebration that was first in God's honor, to *give Him thanks*.  Whether or not you're a believer, it is strange to avoid or cover up that simple historical fact, and I'm thankful that this book doesn't try. <br /> <br />So if you're looking for a way to teach your children about the original Thanksgiving, I can recommend this book as a great start in that direction.  Adults may even learn a thing or two along the way :). <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle <br />	2004-11-01

The idea is that you find a recipe that you would like to make a gift of, get a wide-mouth, quart sized canning jar and layer the ingredients in the order listed inside, without mixing them up so that the presentation is pretty.  Then you seal the jar, top it with a circle of colorful fabric and tie with twine etc.  Each recipe comes with six preprinted tags that you cut out of the book and tie onto your jar; the tags explain what additional ingredients are needed and cooking instructions for your recipient.  There is also a larger page with the recipe and instructions printed for you, the maker.  Sounds nearly foolproof, right?<br /><br />Here's my view of this whole gift mix thing:  you should never give a mix that you haven't tried yourself first, and you must like it very much or it isn't worth the bother to endorse by giving it to somebody else.  Further, because these are meant to be a convenience and a fun thing for your recipient, the recipes should not require a long list of additional ingredients - 3, tops.  I do realize that the \\"wet\\" ingredients like oils, eggs, meats etc. cannot be included in a gift jar for obvious reasons, but all the same...I was a little dismayed to realize that a few of the more tempting recipes in this book had several additional ingredients on the instruction tag.  Just listen to this lineup for Peach Pie Coffee Cake:  6 T Butter, 2 eggs, 1/1/4 C sour cream, 1 tsp vanilla, ½ tsp almond extract, 1 can peach pie filling.  Yikes!  Sour cream...and how many of us would have almond extract or peach pie filling lying about the pantry???  This recipe would be more of a burden than a gift, IMHO.  Happily, there were enough \\"short list\\" recipes to supply me with plenty of gift ideas for my busy parents who desperately need to utilize their slow cooker more often. The best ones (that my D.H. raved about, anyway!) were Tuna Noodle Casserole, Apple Brown Betty, Spanish Red Beans & Rice With Sausage and Chicken & Rice Casserole.<br /><br />The bean-based recipes make a HUGE amount of food - so your recipient had better have a very large crock pot and a very large appetite.  I cut these in half and put them into pint-sized jars and they still make enough to feed a large family each.  The only other niggling complaint is that two recurring ingredients are difficult if not impossible to find at your average supermarket:  celery flakes (that's *flakes*, not salt) and UNSEASONED dry bread cubes (you don't' want Italian seasoning in your Christmas pudding, I trust).  I make my own unseasoned dry bread cubes for my home recipes, but I have no idea how they would hold up in a gift jar for long storage, so I haven't risked it.<br /><br />To tell the truth, I use this as a cookbook for myself more than as an idea for gifts.  It is convenient for me to have make-ahead mixes in labeled plastic containers for getting-home-too-late-to-cook occasions.  Also, these do make perfect additional gifts for somebody who is getting a slow cooker for Xmas.  Therefore I can recommend this cook book with some reservations and cautions.<br /><br />-Andrea, aka Merribellelling lying about the pantry???

That way you can really use it for its intended purpose, i.e., laying it *flat* on the table while \\"scraplifting\\" the layout for yourself:).  Other publishers, please take note! <br /> <br />Now down to the part that everybody really wants to know; how \\"scrapliftable\\" the layouts are.  Dena's collection of moments-in-time pages are attractive (in my humble opinion) and easy enough for somebody with an intermediate level of experience in scrapbooking.  There are lists of materials with each layout, but no step-by-step instructions however, so rank beginners may be a little lost or overwhelmed.  Since I have been at this hobby for nearly two years now, I have no trouble looking at the layouts and \\"translating\\" them into my real-life copies.  Part of this is also the fact that the style is fairly simple, not relying on more than a few embellishments per page and staying away from the collage style designs that are so visually cluttered (in my not-so-humble and admittedly biased opinion!). <br /> <br />Essentially, Scrapbooking Moments in Time is a nice, convenient reference tool for quick page inspiration.  It is laid out by occasion -- color-coded, even! -- which is perhaps the most handy way for our purposes.  I liked the pages well enough on a personal level, although none of them grabbed me as special, so I can't rate it a full five stars.  I can recommend it to scrapbookers with a little experience and a taste for layouts that don't utilize a lot of trendy page accents. <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle <br />	2004-10-21

The message seems to be that daddies protect and provide for their babies, not just humans. I think this book would be the ideal read for Father's Day. <br /> <br />The Very Best Daddy of All is sweet and shows fatherly love in a way that children will universally appreciate.  It can also be used to open discussion with your kids about food, behaviors and survival in the animal kingdom. Recommended. <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle <br />	2004-09-27

The information inside about scrapbooking is correct and helpful, there are many examples of typical childhood moments that would need layouts, such as first haircuts, holidays, etc, and there are some good timesaving tips and techniques.  I liked that page accents were paired down and kept out of the spotlight so that there was room for the photos and journaling to shine through. <br /> <br />For my taste, however, the page designs were a little on the oversimplified side, and that's saying a lot considering that I usually define myself as a Simple-style scrapbooker.  Maybe it all comes down to something as basic as color choices/preferences:  this author does seem to prefer beiges and browns, often in the same layouts, while I like a more sharply contrasting, graphic look with richer and bolder colors for an album about children.  Then, too, I think some of the photos looked a little too \\"lost\\" on the pages - perhaps matting would have benefited them.  Karen's very basic style is a little too basic for me. <br /> <br />Recommended for beginning croppers and people who like *very*simple scrapbooking. <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle <br />	2004-09-21

So now that you've read Eat Right For Your Type and are familiar with the basic theories behind the blood type diets, you need a list that you can grab and take with you on those grocery shopping trips or for those dinners out where you may find menu items that you can't quite remember as either Recommended, Neutral, or Avoid.  This is one of those pocket references that was made to be convenient for these situations if you happen to be a type B like most of my family. <br /> <br />(If you haven't read the abovementioned book first, you should.  It explains in detail the hows and whys of eating according to one's blood type - O, A, B, or AB - instead of the dictates of popular trends.  Foods are divided into three lists for each blood type:  Highly Recommended (foods that have some great benefit or another and act almost as medicine in your system), Neutral (basics that are neither highly beneficial nor bad), or Avoid (foods that you should avoid, either because they have a bad effect on your blood type's metabolism, immune system, digestion, etc).  But back to the review...) <br /> <br />The format of this list book is divided into convenient chapters that each represent a food group, such as Ch.1, Meats and Poultry, Ch. 2, Seafood, Ch.3, Eggs and Dairy, Ch.4, Fats and Oils, and so on until we have categorized every type of common edible into 14 sections altogether.  Each chapter also has a brief introductory essay explaining a few highlights of the lists that follow, for instance, why certain healthy veggies such as tomatoes ended up on the Avoid list for type Bs and why Pineapple is on the Highly Recommended list.  Most of the selections are not explained in detail however, so the reader must take these recommendations on faith.  Also included are chapters on supplementation and medical strategies utilizing these lists. <br /> <br />Now several years have passed since the original publication of ERFYT and I have noticed when comparing the lists in it verses the lists in this more recent pocket reference that there are several discrepancies.  For instance, salmon was a Neutral fish in ERFYT but it now ranked as Highly Beneficial.  That could very well be because of the research that has been done after ERFYT which uncovered new benefits of salmon that were unknown before; I suspect several of these improved rankings have a similar explanation  There are more examples from each chapter that I could go into.  I can only trust that these changes are indeed the results of further research and not publication mistakes.   <br /> <br />Bottom line, this is a very convenient reference to those of us who may have lent our copy of ERFYT to a friend after discovering the great personal freedom and physical well-being that comes with aligning one's diet with blood type.  Get this one if you're a type B; otherwise get the one that matches your blood type. <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle <br /> <br />	2004-08-31

US	50986119	R3KQ5M1FZVVF86	0743456319	801527450	Fantasy Life	Books	4	5	5	N	Y	A somewhat SF twist on an alternate, magical universe	I think Kristine Kathryn Rusch is one of the more interesting authors to snag my attention so far this new millennium.  Her earlier Sci Fi works have some original concepts and good pacing.  This is her first foray into the Fantasy realm that I'm aware of, and it's a worthy addition to her bibliography. <br /> <br />The coast of Seavy County, Oregon, is a reservation of sorts for all of the world's remaining magical water creatures - the \\"mythical\\" mermaids, sylkies, water sprites, etc. of legend.  For over one hundred years the Buckinghams, a resident family of Anchor Bay, have been stewards and sworn protectors of these various beings.  Now mysterious deaths are threatening this special coexistence, and four generations of Buckingham women must forget their internal feuds and pull together, using their psychic powers to discover the source of the threat.   <br /> <br />I love Rusch's take on the disappearance of magic from our planet, her explanation for the steadily declining lack of sightings that goes hand in hand with our steadily eroding environment.  I can also see a distinctly SF bias in her characters' reactions to the supernatural events surrounding them; they almost seem detached and unsurprised at the paranormal, as if astronauts expecting to discover and explore strange new worlds and all the attendant alien species therein.  This is something I have noticed in the writings of other crossover novelists, and I can't decide if this rationalistic flavor is a refreshing twist on the Fantasy genre or a detraction from it.  Perhaps because Anchor Bay's residents are so pragmatic about the otherworldly beings that they coexist with, the author never gets around to delving into the fascinating creatures, their relationships, their cultures, their intimate interactions with humans. Where then is the wonder and awe that so poetically defines Fantasy?  <br /> <br />As a novelist, Rusch did live up to her own standards.  The plot was a very good blend of action, character development and steadily unfolding mystery.  Rusch does seem to have a good handle on human psychology and she uses it effectively.  I just wish that so much of it wasn't uncovered in the form of tardy flashbacks because to me that speaks of manipulation more than good plotting.    <br /> <br />Another note of discontent, publishers please take note:  the cover is very badly done and misrepresents the contents of the book.  For the record, there were no dragons or unicorns in Seavy County, and the painter seems to have been very confused about the light source.  Didn't this well-published author have enough clout to deserve better artistic representation?   <br /> <br />Anyway, despite a few dangling plot threads and a budding romance subplot that seemed to go nowhere, I enjoyed the notion of Seavy County enough to be forgiving in the event of a future series.  All else aside, the writing is good and the setup has great potential.  So, four stars and thumbs up to Rusch for her boldness in breaking into a new genre. <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle <br /> <br />	2004-08-25

Easy-read, simple recipes.  Short ingredient lists.  A cookbook that's clearly organized into short chapters according to meat type.  This is what I should have had when I started the Atkins' Diet last year. <br /> <br />Unlike its predecessor, Dr. Atkins' New Diet Cookbook,  this Quick & Easy Diet Cookbook is very handy.  It's just the thing after a long day when you don't want to get into an elaborate cooking session.  I can pull some meat out of the fridge and look up a recipe;  chances are, I will have everything I need stocked in my low-carb pantry and fridge.  Most of the main dish recipes take under one half hour to prep and finish, and the ones I've tried are all taste-satisfying winners. <br /> <br />There is a beginning chapter that explains how to trim the carb content down if you're in the early Induction phase of the diet.  Mostly, though, the meals are all low-carb enough for the Ongoing Weight Loss and Maintenance phases.  I think dieters who are into other low carb diets will find it useful, too.  There is no guesswork about how many carbs per serving when you measure your ingredients correctly and consult the carb, calorie, etc. counts at the bottom of the page.   <br /> <br />Finally, I want to thank the team that finished this book after the Doctor's tragic accident last year.  It's great that his \\"estate\\" is carrying on his good work to help this country and many more around the world learn how to get healthy and stay that way.  Thank you all, and may God bless. <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle <br /> <br />	2004-08-20

Some fellow Amazon customers who have been reading my reviews for a while might be groaning to themselves right about now, \\"Oh no, she's onto another diet again!\\"  Actually, no.  I'm very happy with Atkins, thank you.  It's just that now I have a more knowledgeable appreciation of why it works so well for some people (like me) and others can stick to the USDA pyramid diet model with its recommended six to nine servings of grains per day (like my friend Amy. *I* tried that for about ten years and only got fatter).  It's all in the blood. <br /> <br />We all learned sometime in our growing up years that everybody has one of four blood types: A, B, O, or AB.  Dr. D'Adamo starts off with a simple description of the chemical differences in the blood types, then tracks the progress of the genetic adaptations that created each one over human history, starting with the original (O) hunter-gatherers, then to the agrarian cultures (A), then the nomadic cultures (B).  These latter blood types were necessary to accommodate the lifestyle and dietary changes that occurred when humans stopped being hunter-gatherers and started either living in densely populated, agriculturally-based communities or later, taking up nomadic lifestyles that required a flexible diet.  Each person on earth has a genetic heritage linked to one of these four blood types that will directly affect not only which foods they can subsist on but which ones can be like slow toxins in a metabolic or digestive system not designed for them.   <br /> <br />In my case, I am a type O, the \\"meatean\\" as I dubbed it.  I lost 47 lbs on the Atkins diet last year and my father, also a type O, had similar success.  We both felt more energized and healthier than in years.  After reading the dietary and exercise profiles of type O's in ERFYT I was stunned that they came fairly close to a low-carb diet:  heavy on the meats, fish, oils, and leafy greens, low on grains (for instance, he cites wheat products as \\"toxic\\" to the type O system, although oats are considered benign).  My type B mother and sister on the other hand have eaten a somewhat higher-carb diet all their lives and remained reasonably healthy and slim.  They also adore the dairy products and my mom raised us to drink milk and eat yoghurt and cheese daily, which benefited my bones and teeth, although not my type O metabolism.  I was stunned at how right on target the blood type profiles were according to my own family - and later, my friends when I started asking their blood types. Os represent the highest percentage of the population, and that may be key to why low-carb diets are all the rage in this country.   I really believe that Dr. D'Adamo may be onto something here. <br /> <br />There were a few things I had to disagree with, however. For one thing, the author recommends that type Os try to include a relatively high number of fruits and starchy items in their diets, which anybody who has tried low-carbing knows is guaranteed to ruin the fat-burning metabolic state.  Even worse - the author claims that refined sugars are fine, and outlines no firm limits on their consumption. Hel-lo.... <br /> <br />The single most valuable piece of information that I came away with was that there is no single diet that is right for everybody.  The blood type theories of Dr. D'Adamo explain very plausibly why your friend may do well as a vegetarian but you need a low-carb diet to stay slim.  The \\"low-fat lie\\" of the Nineties may not be a lie for type As:  but it can be deadly for type Bs and type Os.  Similarly there are even vegetables and fruits that benefit some and harm others.  The \\"avoid\\" lists for typse O and B will certainly find their way onto my refrigerator door as quick references for my family.  So, although I don't agree with every part of these theories one hundred percent, I think the insights that Eat Right For Your Type offers are worth considering by anybody who has dietary problems (who doesn't?). <br />-Andrea, akaMerribelle <br /> <br />	2004-08-11
US	50986119	R1DAK3MM5O9MKJ	055380250X	303170656	The Taking	Books	4	2	2	N	N	New direction with familiar Koontz signposts?	I stopped reading Dean Koontz a few years ago when he started seeming a little repetitious in the plot department.  I figured his reservoir of ideas was dried up, and I didn't want to waste my time and money.  Then my generally non-reading dh bought a copy of The Taking and started talking it up so well that I decided I had to give Koontz one more try.  Well, I'm both glad and disappointed because some of the things I liked about Koontz's style as an author are missing, but he has improved in other areas during my hiatus from his work. <br /> <br />Character Development:  this book was definitely not character-driven, unlike most of the author's previous works.  Relatively little time is \\"wasted\\" on the thought processes and flashbacks of our hero and heroine, much less anybody else.  On the one hand it makes for tight, fast-paced writing which is very uncharacteristic of the Dean Koontz I remember, but OTOH, I miss delving into the characters' psyches just a bit.   <br /> <br />Plot:  original for Koontz (in other words, he hasn't recycled his own past plots in this one), but somewhat borrowed from other famous works of fiction, especially SF and oddly enough, there are a few biblical overtones as well.  .  (side note:  Dean clearly doesn't read the bible much, he gets a few concepts wrong, but since most readers probably wont' know this, he can get away with it.  I just wish as a Christian that he wouldn't \\"go there\\" since he really doesn't know what he is talking about, biblically speaking). <br />Basically, a couple that live in a cabin in the San Bernardino mountains wake up one night to find a weird unseasonable rainstorm raging, then the news reveals that cataclysimic and horrifying events are taking place the world over.  The couple decides to head for town, barely escaping dangers unknown, only to find that other survivors meeting at the local bar don't have any more idea of what's gong on than they do.  Now they must come up with a plan of defense and survival. <br /> <br />Pacing:  Quick and relentless.  The events sweep the reader up into scenes of creepiness, poetic descriptions, and action almost immediately.  The characters don't have time to stop and analyze much until the middle, and even then the speculation is brief.  I think this is realistic human reaction given the odd circumstances, so I approve.  Still... <br /> <br />Resolution:  Unsatisfying.  The ending was abrupt, disappointing and not well-explained.  This is okay if The Taking was intended to be first in a series, but I don't see this noted anywhere.  I felt cheated. <br /> <br />Bottom Line:  you may like this or not depending on how much you prefer action-style horror over psychological, speculation-style horror of the type that Koontz was known  for previously. <br /> <br />I decided to give it 4 stars after much internal debating.  What decided it for me was appreciation of the author's attempts to branch out and try new things.  That's admirable, expecially at his age (no offense...). <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-08-09

Today I Feel Silly is a rhyming book about a free-spirited little girl who narrates little stories about the days she feels different emotions - silly, angry, joyful, confused, discouraged, etc.  The illustrations are fun and informal watercolors, and definitely well-matched to the warm tone that author Jamie Lee Curtis conveys.  The main point of the story is a sort of \\"I'm okay - you're okay\\" message about how it's all right to feel all kinds of emotions, not just the positive ones.   <br /> <br />I picked up this book on a whim, mainly influenced by the fact that I like Jamie Lee Curtis from what little I do know about her as a person ( I know, bad, bad, bad).  My overall impression is that it is cute and fun, but my kids didn't seem to respond much to it - this despite the fact that there's an interactive \\"emotion wheel\\" built into the last page.  They fiddled with it for a bit and quickly ended up pulling the inner disc out of it in an attempt to see what was inside.  I don't think it was put together with realistic kids in mind.  Sigh. <br /> <br />Well it was a nice effort Jamie, but I don't think we'll be looking into your other kids' books.   <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle <br />	2004-08-07

Waking up with gum in his hair, dropping his sweater in the sink and eating dry breakfast cereal sets the tone for the rest of the story; weirdly enough, it's not negative energy that gets built up, but humor.  Who can't relate, I ask you? <br /> <br />I thought that a big part of this story's charm was the run on sentences that narrated in Alexander's first person voice.  Example:  \\"On the way downstairs the elevator door closed on my foot and while we were waiting for my mom to go get the car Anthony made me fall where it was muddy and then I started crying because of the mud and Nick said I was a crybaby and...\\".  It's great because that's how kids his age really speak when they are bursting with information and emotion at the same time.  I think it is a sign of an incredibly stuffy mindset to pick apart such a well-loved, time-tested winner of a book because it \\"teaches kids poor grammar\\".  Phooey.  What it really teaches is that we all have \\"those\\" days, and that we can get over them as Alexander did. <br /> <br />Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day will appeal to kids of all ages, especially boys.  Better yet, it will crack a smile or two out of the reading adult.   <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle <br />	2004-08-07

Here's a sampling of my (so far) favorites from Dana's cookbook: <br /> Egg Foo Yong (like what it sounds, really more of an omelet but very sophisticated) <br /> Jalapeno Lime Scallops <br /> Salmon in Ginger Cream (fresh, simple and tastes gourmet) <br /> Asian Pork and Cabbage (I always used to hate cabbage, but now I look forward to it) <br /> Chicken Chili Verde (my carb-eatin' family spoons it into tortillas, I just devour it straight - a family-praised dish) <br /> Italian Sausage w/ Onions and Peppers <br /> Brewery Chicken with Vegetables <br /> <br />Here's a weird fact:  although these recipes make liberal use of prepackaged foods (such as frozen and canned veggies, jarred minced garlic, bagged salad greens, seasoning blends, baking mix, etc) and spices for time-cutting, most of them also make liberal use of fresh veggies along with the omnipresent meat and eggs.  Really, I eat more fresh-cooked veggies now that I have this cookbook than ever before. She's even gotten me to try \\"new\\" vegetables, like turnips, which I never would have used in my high-carb days. Yup, I am now a culinary swank, my friend. <br /> <br />The author has a no-nonsense, conversational style that let me knowright away that not only has she \\"been there, done that\\" but that she isn't the type to waste her own time much less mine.  There's an introductory section in which Dana preps the cook on her timesaving cooking techniques and tips on what and how to stock a low-carb pantry to make it even more convenient.  I strongly suggest that you read this section first, as it will really help you streamline your speed-cooking sessions.  The next most important section is the Omelet section, in which the secrets to a foolproof omelet are revealed.  Really and truly, if you follow her method (well it's not actually Dana Carpender's method but one I've seen chefs on food network demonstrate before) you will be able to make perfect omelets for breakfast every time, which of course is indispensable in the low carb diet.  The cookbook is then divided into sections based on the main meat being cooked, plus all-in-one skillet recipes, and side dishes that sub for the more traditional (read: carby) options like mashed potatoes and rice.   <br /> <br />Okay that's enough babble for one review.  Let's just say that I urgently recommend this cookbook to anybody who is trying to maintain a low-carb lifestyle and/or still keep their family happy at mealtimes.  It works, you'll be happy and you may win a few more converts to low-carb along the way. <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-08-05

Sharon,  Phd (psychoanalyst) team up in this book to address common problem situations in raising children.  I was initially attracted to this book because the title stood out among all the other parenting books of its kind.  Marilu Henner, in her introduction, admits that \\"I refuse to raise a brat!\\" was her own memorable quote one day in Dr. Sharon's office when she had reached the limits of her own frustration with her 14-month old boy.   <br /> <br />This book is organized into topical chapters, with each chapter consisting of several questions asked by real parents and answered in a few short paragraphs first by Dr. Sharon, then by Marilu (to give a layperson's perspective).  They seldom disagree significantly, but rather complement each other's approach to commenting on the issues and looking at the problem from differing angles.  The topical questions format seemed very workable, much like that of What to Expect When You're Expecting. <br /> <br />I found the advice to be moderately conservative overall, backed by common sense thinking.  Some of the suggestions to common problems worked for me, such as ways to help the older child deal with the arrival of a new sibling.  In some places, though, Dr. Sharon comments on subjects that she obviously does not have expertise in, such as in this excerpt from a section on sleep problems:  \\"The overindulged child (less motivated and ambitious) will generally require more sleep than the child who is subject to a balance of frustration and gratification...\\" and goes on to suggest later that 9 or 10 hours of sleep per night is fine for a toddler.  Current research on healthy sleep habits actually suggest that @12 hours per night is the optimum PHYSIOLOGICAL requirement at that age.  When Dr. Sharon sticks to psychoanalysis, however, she is not usually far off the mark. <br /> <br /> I was unable to determine exactly why Marilu Henner was co-authoring a book on child-rearing.   Her contributions are mostly anecdotal.  She does put a little down to earth humor into her comments, and keeps the book entertaining.   To my knowledge, she has no specific training in counseling parents, nor any special advantage that any other parent of two wouldn't have.  The fact that she is an actress isn't exactly a ringing endorsement for expertise on parenting, if you look at it statistically.  I would guess that Dr. Sharon was just glad to have the celebrity endorsement helping her book get published and stand out. <br /> <br />I Refuse to Raise a Brat is an easy-read approach to frequently asked parenting questions, and not a bad one; but its standout appeal is perhaps more from the novelty of celebrity authorship rather than any real authority or superior insight.  I would not hesitate to recommend it to devoted fans of Marilu Henner or as a light read to parents who are not experiencing any special problems with their children <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle. <br />	2004-08-04
US	50986119	R2Y1ZYJUAAGM54	0670036781	62767600	The English Roses	Books	4	10	12	N	N	Not a bad story, delightful pictures	I don't care for Madonna, as an artist or as a celebrity.  HOWEVER.  I am glad that I gave this book a chance based on its own merits rather than letting either her fans' or her detractors' opinions decide for me.  Turns out, she's a reasonable writer (3 stars) and the illustrator, J.  Fulvimari is outstanding (5 stars).  Average the two together and you have a four star picture book for girls. <br /> <br />The story:  a clique of four popular schoolgirls known as the English Roses are jealous of a little-miss-perfect beauty named Bindah.  Sweet Bindah has no friends and is often lonely,  but everybody praises her so loudly that the English Roses decide that she doesn't need their friendship.  They ignore her and shut her out.  One day, a fairy godmother comes to them in a dream and shows them what is really going on in Bindah's life, who must cook and clean for her father at home because her mother has passed away.  Now the English Roses are convicted for their behavior and must decide if their jealousy was worth their bad treatment of this girl. <br /> <br />In my opinion, the premise of a saintly, beautiful girl having no friends is a little thin, even laughable (I mean come on, how often does that really happen in our looks-worshipping culture?  Much more likely that a homely girl would end up lonely in my school).  Still, the moral of the story - do not judge people on their appearances - is a good one.  Better still, the colorful pen illustrations by J. Fulvimari transform what would have been a humdrum tale into something very pretty and whimsical.  (I wonder how many other first-time children's authors score such a top-notch illustrator?)   <br /> <br />I had a hard time deciding what age range this book was aimed at, as it could have been a picture book for the primary school girls or a reader with great illustrations for secondary schoolchildren.  I decided that I would recommend it for either. <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle. <br />	2004-07-28

His imagery and descriptions are always unique in a way that no other author has been able to approach.  It's like comparing a dense fudge to plain, cakey brownies; hey, you gotta love brownies but the fudge will blow them out of the water every time. <br /> <br />The Elliot family is a motley collection of supernatural beings from every corner of the planet.  For whatever reason, they have picked a house out in the middle of Nowhere, America to collect and settle in for their regular (once or twice a century) gatherings.  The core family, Mother, Father, Grandmere, Grandpere, Cecy and Tommy, remain to hold the fort in between.  Little mortal Tommy is the only one who doesn't fit in, but only because he was adopted; and oh, what he wouldn't give to be able to fly like Uncle Einar or change bodies like Cecy!  For the enchantment he feels when listening to Grandmere's stories of the Family is made up of good old-fashioned wonder and love. <br /> <br />Bradbury's recent book From the Dust Returned is exactly as rich and magical as I would have expected from this author.  Small wonder, as he has had decades to perfect every well-honed metaphor.  This slow is apparently an advantage to character development and visualization, but a plot cobbled together of several previously published short stories does leave the storyline weakened.  Still, for Bradbury devotees like me it is not to be missed.  Would you pass up a chocolately ganache torte just because somebody left out the pecans?  I would hope not. <br />-lil' readin' sprite <br />	2004-07-28

Big Truck \\"taught Little Truck everything he knew\\" about carting in crops from the fields and how to navigate the big city roads on the way to the Farmer's Market each day.  One day, Big Truck is unable to start up and he has to be towed away.  Little Truck is worried for his \\"dad\\", and frightened of the big tasks ahead of him to be completed for the first time alone.  Will Big Truck come back okay, and will Little Truck do a good job on Farley's Farm all by himself? <br /> <br />We have had this book for about 3 years and two little boys now.  I don't know how little girls would react to it, but we love it so much that my older son who is turning 6 soon still asks for it.  The two year old has recently discovered how fun it is to look for the whimsical details within the larger pictures, such as the chicken family, the cat, and all the other little residents of the farm. <br /> <br />This is a very warmly and brilliantly illustrated picture book for preschool aged children.  It speaks to them in a clearly recognizable analogy about the fears kids may have to face if a parent becomes sick or has to be away for a short period of time, and the story shows how Little Truck coped beautifully with his own situation.  The bonus is that Big Truck and Little Truck model a great work ethic with lots of love. <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle <br />	2004-07-28

So this woman is stuck in hard times indeed:  husband left her, bills piling up, pregnant, trying to take care of four other kids, etc.  She has always played life in her small town by the rules, never upsetting anybody or standing out.  Now she has to find a way to earn money fast, and her family can?t live on the pity of the community.  Reluctantly, Aletta Honor plays the only card she has left and opens for business as a psychic reader.  But wouldn?t you know it, the whole town seems to have something to say about this development and pretty soon the right-wing religious folk are picketing.  Despite persecution from her husband, her church and even her mother, Aletta is determined to help everybody who comes to her door in need because she truly believes that her gift is from God.  What a likeable heroine. <br /> <br />Author Danya Dunbar writes the lives of Aletta, her family and friends with heart and sympathy; even despicable, cheating husband Jimmy and the stereotypically intolerant and self-righteous religious folk that protest Aletta?s business are handled with some softer moments.  Though insightful flashbacks and Aletta?s psychic visions we learn many secrets of Okay County?s residents that explain how they came to be the people they are today, good but full of hurts.  The overriding theme appears to be that everybody is just looking for a little love however they can.  (get out those sap buckets!).  I do wish Dunbar hadn?t written Aletta as so much of a dashboard saint herself, however; her only flaw appears to be loving people too much.  Syrup, anyone? <br /> <br />Personally, I found the book?s title to be a little too prophetic of its lukewarm plotting.  I have no real objection to it Read The Saints and Sinners of Okay county if you want a nice, quick read for the summer and a smidgen of feel-good New Age style spirituality.  I?m just not a sentimentalist myself, so this type of novel reads as over-the-top to me.  But hey, different strokes and all that, so you might enjoy it. <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle <br />	2004-07-22

Series)	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Humorous and sympathetic, a great pick	Marc Brown's children's series on PBS is priceless; Arthur and his friends were introduced to us that way.  It was only recently that I became aware of the books, which actually came first!  Well, if you're a fan of the cartoon, you'll love the books even more. <br />DW's Lost Blankie is a classic kind of story that all kids can relate to - who can't remember the sudden anxiety of losing their own blankie, or some favorite toy when they were very young?  This is a short story with a light touch of humor which shows how they can deal with it, offers sympathy and reassurance and helps kids know how they can keep calm and work through tracking down that all important security object. My mom heard me reading it to my kids and laughed out loud at one point, it was so true to life.<br /> Author Marc Brown apparently illustrates his own books.  His watercolors are warm, nicely done and perfectly suited to the subject matter.  We really like his style in general, so my kids (aged 2 and 5) and I will be selecting more of his stories for our bedtime reading.  Highly recommended for all children from early toddlerhood through the primary school years.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-07-15
US	50986119	R2MTIIAJJJJ2TI	1402710291	189255600	Designer Scrapbooks with Anna Griffin: Memorable Moments Captured with Style	Books	5	51	51	N	Y	Tasteful, feminine, stylish:  scrapbook pages for grownups	This is a very personal collection of the author's own scrapbook pages; the photographs are all of herself, her family and friends.  In all, there were perhaps sixty samples with full instructions for recreating them at the end of each chapter.<br />The emphasis throughout the book is on allowing traditions to star as the theme ideas for all kinds of pages:  the sections include Birthday, Valentine's, Easter, Family Vacation &amp; Travel, Anniversary, Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years.  I was surprised that really very few of them were wedding themes, which is of course what Anna Griffin is widely known for.  On the other hand, watch out for the Thanksgiving section, which contains some (in my opinion) very sorely needed and wonderful ideas that any family could use in a scrapbook. <br />As you might expect, this book showcases pages made exclusively with Anna Griffin's own designer line of papers, accents et al. The author explains in the introduction that she gets her inspiration from antique textile patterns, engravings and botanicals.  Typically, a page design utilizes about half a dozen or more coordinated patterns, little (if any) solids, and perhaps a memorabilia envelope, pocket or surprise foldout section.  In place of purchased accents, the reader is shown how to make the most of cutting and folding the papers for some very stunning effects.  The final touches are often satin ribbon bows or buttons. The end result is a very flowery, multi-patterned look on every page; some will think it's lovely, others might feel that it is too cluttered or busy. I would say that it isn't truly a \\"collage\\" style, since it is so carefully coordinated and not random at all, but rather Anna Griffin has succeeded in creating an authentically Victorian look and feel to her scrapbooks. The only downside is that there seems to be precious little space reserved for meaningful journaling.<br />My bottom line impression is that creating pages the Anna Griffin way is a very involved process that requires planning, a few precision papercrafting skills (beginner/intermediate level) and of course the exclusive Anna Griffin line of papers and die cuts (I doubt many of us have much success trying to mix patterns from other designers for these results). <br /> If you like the lavish Victorian style and you have a reliable source for Anna Griffin supplies, then you'll love this book.  <BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-07-03

As a mom of two boys I can't tell you how many times I've wished that books about scrapping for kids didn't get dominated by so much darn pink!  Oh well, now I have no excuse not to start my kids' own Growing Up Years albums.<br />All Boy Scrapbook Pages is from the Memory Makers folks who think of just about everything.  The book is divided into themed sections to display examples of:  <BR>Introduction/Basics of how to scrapbook<BR>Attitude (portrait/moments of the \\"macho\\" stuff)<BR>Softer Side<BR>Boy's Life (enthusiasms like sports and hobbies etc.)<BR>Boys will be Boys (various antics)<BR>Page title ideas<br />I was impressed with the clean, modern look of the pages.  I noticed that a lot of color blocking was used, also much thoughtful journaling.  It was a welcome change of pace from the floral- and accent-laden pages that (IMHO) we women seem to gravitate more naturally toward.  The color choices were sometimes on the bold graphic side, other times muted, but very elegant and sophisticated overall.  I think this collection is a good representation of the range of subjects and looks that are possible when dealing with boys' pages.<br />Each page included detailed instructions on how to recreate it.  I was left with few questions and  a lot of inspiration.  My only nitpick:  the pages were light on boys under the age of two and boys in the later teen years.  I suppose that's what those baby books are for, but what about teenagers?  I for one do not consider teens to be \\"grown ups\\" quite yet!<br />So, this is a must for parents of in-between toddler and teen boys as far as I'm concerned.  Unreservedly recommended.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-07-01

So you're on a low carb diet, looking good and feeling great, but your family is definitely on a high carb diet and getting tired of the plain meat dishes you've been serving up lately.  Or maybe you are the one who's tired of them.  You would like to be able to expand your low carb recipe list, but you don't have a lot of time to spend on the fancy schmancy rigamarole that some low carb cookbooks require.  If only you could have your fine palate and your waistline both satisfied...<br />Say no more my meat-eatin' bretheren!  The Everyday Low Carb Slow Cooker Cookbook  was literally the answer to my prayers some months ago.  As a mom of two small boys and wife to a very picky man I was having a hard time keeping everybody happy at the dinner table while I watched my weight; the \\"two-entr&eacute;e meal\\" was becoming the norm and it took way too much time.  In my high carb days I had used my blessed time saver, the crock pot, regularly but recently it was gathering dust on the top shelf.  Thank the Lord I can put it to work again and regain my time/sanity.<br />Now I have to try a minimum of six recipes before I feel that I can review a cookbook with fairness.  The recipes that I have completed from TELCSCC are:<br />Seafood Crustless Quiche (I didn't miss the crust and neither did they - Fabulous!)<br />Orange Pork<br />Sausage and White Bean Soup (my dh literally told me it was the best soup ever, bar none)<br />Chicken with Sun-Dried Tomatoes and Artichokes (rich and hearty, a complete meal)<br />Chicken with 40 Cloves of Garlic (yes, really!)<br />Pesto Beef with Grape Tomatoes and Fresh Mozzarella<br />I think the genius of this cookbook is that the authors recognize that low carb dieters are not only just as busy as everybody else, but also come in a variety of skill levels in the kitchen.  Accordingly, there is a special section at the beginning just for the quick'n'easy crowd that features fewer ingredients and timesavers like canned food and packaged mixes to add to your fresh meats and veggies.  Believe it or not, the Pesto Beef recipe was one of these!  Not that the more \\"complicated\\" recipes are that much longer or harder, believe me:  the authors make it clear that since slow cookery is all about convenience, their mission is to keep it as simple as possible without sacrificing taste.  It would appear that their mission was successful.<br />In many cases these recipes are so loaded with veggies and hearty broth that you won't need to make a salad or a side dish and nobody will even notice. There are so many more that I haven't gotten to yet, but I'm dying to try the desserts next; Peanut Butter Fudge Cake with Peanut Butter Fudge Drizzle, Coconut Custard, and Pumpkin Pudding, which is promised to be like the pie without the crust.  Judging by my success with the quiche, the slow cooker is a natural with those eggy custards and puddings (averaging about 3-4 hours on low).<br />I would compare this cookbook to Mable Hoffman's Crockery Cookery (the high-carb \\"bible\\" for slow cookers) in terms of quality &amp; variety of recipes and simplicity of use.  My family has had no complaints since I've started using it, in fact they like TELCSCC dishes better than many of my higher carb dishes.

Now that we've eliminated the apathetics, here's the review for the rest of us:<br />The Eyre Affair is a great love letter to the famous English authors of centuries past, notably Shakespeare, Bronte, Austen, Dickens, etc.  Well not really - it's a clever alternate universe thriller in which Litratec investigator/enforcer Thursday Next takes on a case involving the kidnapping of some of the most beloved literary characters in British lore.  You see, in Thursday's world, the supernatural is very often a natural part of everyday life; vampires and werewolves are regulated by a department very much like Animal Control, time travel -talented individuals are recruited for their services in government branches, and the integrity of national literary treasures is guarded zealously by top secret levels of those branches.  I could love to live in this world were it not so chaotic, what with history being constantly tampered with by various factions and all.  Even so, it's great fun to visit.<br />Author Jasper Fforde can be caught using this forum to stage literary debates and in-jokes, much to the delight of the Anglophile readers. In place of religious fanatics coming to one's door proselytizing, you have Baconians whose mission in life is to convince the world that Shakespeare's works were written by Francis Bacon.  Fforde demonstrates a very British tendency to use proper names to lampoon a character.  His prodigal creation of Thursday Next is an unlikely mixture of reserved-but-courageous traditional British heroines and modern pop culture action stars reminiscent of Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Evanovich's Stephanie Plum.  Fittingly, Ms. Next's interesting life seems to parallel Jane's a little more closely than coincidence.<br />If there is one flaw in this book, it's that the reader is thrown into an alternate universe in which we are playing a lot of catch up thoughout the plot.  This sometimes had the side effect of distracting me and sometimes it contributed to the humor.  Perhaps the author should have included a prologue chapter which summarized the necessary backstory, but overall TEA is worth sticking to nonetheless.<BR> <BR>The Eyre Affair is a great find, and I look forward to other tales from this adorably messy universe.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-06-29

Most of these designs and instructions are nicely applied to individual cardmaking as well as mass-producing for invitations and announcements.  <br />Author Julie Hickey starts with a section that explores basic tools and supplies, including the card stock and envelopes.  I can honestly say that this is the first cardmaking book I've come across that explains the logistics of stocking up on supplies so thoroughly well.  <BR>She has also perfected a standardized system which uses a few basic card sizes/shapes for all the designs.  There are even patterns included for making envelopes (thank you!) so that if you can't find suitable envelopes at the craft store you won't be stuck with the ugly industrial kind to ruin the effect you worked to achieve with your custom card.<br /> Hickey seems to start from an assumed beginner level and progresses the crafter though different projects to the more advanced cards at the end.  All the steps are carefully illustrated with photos.   I will describe the overall look of her designs as simple and elegant, but except for a few, not particularly innovative.  A nice range of popular materials and styles are explored in the projects, including buttons, charms, microbeads, vellum, copper, shrink plastic and rubber-stamping.  These are fun cards you might make up ahead for the sheer enjoyment and file safely away until an occasion calls for one; and yes as promised, there are card ideas to suit any occasion, or that can be easily adapted.<br />Recommended for card crafters that are looking for enjoyable, pretty projects that don't take up much time or money.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-06-29

I could feast all day on a book of fine words.  To me, words have colors, flavors and textures.  They roll around the tongue like savory morsels, each distinct.  There is an art to combining them, much as there is an art to marrying flavors in haute cuisine.  Sometimes a chef is adamant about a certain spice or food element for his special dish, as only that one will do to complete a complex palate.  In the same way, I will search carefully for just the right word to complete my thoughts.  It is a labor of love.<br />The Superior Person's Book of Words is just the thing if your dictionary proves uninspiring.  Not only will you find just what you are looking for, but the entertaining and wry wit employed in the definitions will sally the keen reader upon new directions in  sassy verbal repartee.  Many of the listings are invaluable as veiled insults, and the author frequently highlights these with sample usage sentences.  My only comment on that is, living with Peter Bowler must be like living with Oscar Wilde.<br />There are *some* pedestrian listings thrown in, presumably as padding.  Or maybe they are intended as mollifiers for the \\"inferior\\" readers?  In any case, words such as \\"heterosexual\\", \\"pastime\\" and \\"impalement\\" hardly count as tidbits for the esoteric lexicographer in my opinion.  Thankfully, they are relatively few.<br />The best part of this book though is the way the author words the definitions.  Some examples: <BR>Papuliferous.  Pimply. Typical condition of a groak.<BR>Groak.  One who stands around while others eat, in the hope that he will be invited to join in.  A good name for a female relative's boyfriend.<BR>Nugatory.  Of no value, trifling, insubstantial, pointless.

However, after several months I plateaued at about 25 lbs above my ideal, and of course I wanted to jump-start my weight loss again.  So, I did a little investigating, discovered the Neanderthin diet and decided to give it a try.<br />A brief summary of the basics of this diet:  eat no technology-dependant foods.  By that, author Ray Audette meant that if a food needs technology beyond a sharp stick or stone to process it to become edible, or to exist in its present form, it was never a natural part of our human diet, which had its origins with hunter-gatherer societies.  What foods absolutely must be processed and/or cooked are:  grains, including wheat, rice and most others; starchy vegetables like potatoes and yams; legumes, including peanuts, beans and peas.  Refined sugars and artificial sweeteners are absolutely unnatural, although a small bit of honey is fine. Modern fruits are okay but must be eaten sparingly due to the fact that they have been altered over thousands of years to barely resemble the wild originals that our ancestors snacked on, usually much larger and with a much higher sugar content.  Fermented foods are of course absent without our technology, so that excludes cheeses, vinegars and alcohols.  Dairy products are also absent from the lives of hunter gatherers for obvious reasons.  That leaves us with meats, fish/seafood, eggs, nuts, most vegetables, greens, and small amounts of fruits and berries.<br />I tried the hunter-gatherer diet for about one month.  Just as with Atkins, I felt wonderful and had all of the other side benefits of the low-carb diet, but my weight loss was still stalled.  You see, the allowance of fruits on this diet was too great a temptation and I overdid it there.Longtime dieters may be familiar with the term \\"trigger\\", which is anything that causes your cravings to resurface.  Some people like me have carb triggers so sensitive that even fruits can activate them.  So, reluctantly I concluded that I would have to replace the Neanderthin diet with a low-carb diet that forbid me to have any fruit, at least during the weight loss phase.  When I am finished and at my goal weight, however, I will return to the Neanderthin diet to maintain my excellent health, as I can't imagine a life entirely without strawberries, peaches and melons!<br />I should note here that the authors Audette and Gilchrist do not advocate this diet as an aid to weight loss per se, but for reversing health problems and improving overall fitness.  They theorize that diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, obesity and many other curses of civilization are the byproducts of an immune system response to unnatural foods like grains:  they show how you can trace the origins and progression of these conditions from the time grains and other technology-dependant foods were introduced into a culture.  Examples in our European culture point to the Industrial Revolution as the biggest health problem of our history, when steam powered mills made refined white flours and sugars commonly available and cheap to the masses.  Until then heart disease and diabetes (just to pick two examples) were so rare as to be unheard of; now they are epidemic in the USA, which by the way consumes more refined flour and sugar per person than any nation in the world.<br />Audette's theories and explanations make perfect sense to me, a non-scientist.  They may partly explain why other low-carb diets are successful for weight loss.  I can also see the sense in removing refined and processed foods from my diet, along with all the chemicals and trans fats that come with them.  It's just too bad that a hunter-gatherer diet has a built in flaw, namely that the diet food industry can't cash in on it (remember, no artificial sweeteners or processed foods), and therefore it won't get the kind of publicity that diets like Atkins and Protein Power have had.  Hopefully, the good word of mouth from satisfied dieters will spread and eventually get Audette nd Gilchrist the acclaim they deserve for helping so many people get back their health and quality of life.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-06-16
US	50986119	R1NG0SGB6RR87O	1410401162	560720196	The Retrieval Artist and Other Stories	Books	4	7	7	N	Y	Welcome selection of SF stories from underappreciated author	The Retrieval Artist and other stories is a wonderful collection of shorts that originally appeared in the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction - all by Kristine Kathryn Rusch, editor.  The title story is apparently a forerunner to a later series of novels involving the gumshoe-styled hero, Miles Flint.  If this was an accurate predictor of the style and quality of writing to come later, then I can see why Flint has so many fans. <br /> As much as I loved that retro take on a very futuristic tale, however, it was not the strongest one in my opinion.  Dancers like Children and its sequel, Alien Influences struck a stronger chord with me because of Rusch's valiant attempt to create and explain a radically different alien psychology.  Many other novelists have tried to do that and only ended up anthropomorphizing them in the end.  These two stories contain some of the more original ideas in SF today.<br />The rest of the selections are worthy, although one or two seem more like filler material.  In my opinion the cover price was a little steep for this collection, and it didn't need to be published in trade paperback form.  On the whole though I think The Retrieval Artist passed my litmus test:  now I want more.  And thanks to Rusch's later works, I will have it.  <BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-06-04

Each page has carefully placed cutouts so that when you turn it, the ladybug on that page disappears but the others appear to move to the next spread.  What you end up with is a clever rhyming book that teaches simple subtraction with three-dimensional ladybugs.<br />This book is sturdy, colorful and well-made.  The ladybugs show no signs of falling off even after two years of being explored by curious little fingers.  My children love the novelty of it and request it again and again.  Completely recommended for kids ages one to five.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-06-03

My grandpa's stories about growing up were priceless, and deserved pages that honored both the look and feel of their time.  I needed a quick way to \\"catch up\\" on the Thirties (and a source for collage photos to scan).<br />Thank goodness for Pleasant Company.  If you haven't heard about their American Girl books and dolls let me tell you that they may be this generation's solution to getting girls ages 7 to 12 interested in history.  Kit is a fictional character in a series of books written to appeal to girls in that age range.  Growing up in the 1930s, she deals with issues typical of that generation as well as everything young people from any time deal with, so modern readers can truly relate to her.  <br />Kit is made more real in the mind's eye when put in the context of this Welcome To book.  The book's organization takes us from the prosperous late 20s that set it up, through the Depression and onto the New Deal at the end.  We find hundreds of era photos of people, places and things that made up the fabric of life back then.  Richly supplemented with illustrations, the visuals are grounded with chapter introductions and short blurbs that contain interesting trivia.  I can see how it would be a good resource for school reports in grade school, but it's arranged in a fun way for kids so that they'll read it even when they don't \\"have\\" to.<br />Worth owning if you have a grade school child in the house.  Check out the other Welcome To books for some of the other fictional girls:  colonial times, pioneer days, Victorian era, 1940s, etc; history will come alive for them.<BR>-Andrea, akaMerribelle.	2004-06-02

Well, when \\"gift\\", \\"scrapbook\\" and \\"In a snap\\" are in the same sentence, my mind makes connections before I know it.  These expectations were:<br />1. The book would focus on small scale scrapbooks (smaller than 8&amp;1/2 by 11) suitable for gifting<BR>2. I would learn how to plan such an album from start to finish <BR>3. The author would teach ways to organize my time so that I could finish the album quickly<BR>4. The book would thoroughly picture some examples of complete gift scrapbooks and/or layout plans, from the first page to the end.<BR>5. I would be shown both how to complete a variety of ready-made albums and also how to make our own albums from scratch<BR>6. The layouts featured inside would be the same kind of high-quality, cutting-edge styles found in Memory Makers magazine<br />I'd say most of these expectations were fulfilled.  I did learn a lot about how to plan my gift scrapbook before I started, tips on how to unify the look of the album and how to cut down on unnecessary materials so that I could work quickly. There were some cute mini album projects detailed in the last section which are to be made from scratch. There were a lot of ideas for theme albums that I wouldn't have thought of on my own, but which I will use to make great gifts for my family and friends in the years to come.  I really wasn't surprised that the looks of the scrapbooks that author Pam Klassen used to illustrate these methods were on the simple side-it makes sense that simpler means faster.  Not a collage style clutter in the bunch (which suits my style perfectly).<br />The two that weren't fulfilled do bother me a bit, though.  Numbers 4 and 6 just didn't come through for me. We see a few object lessons illustrated with more than one page from an album, but never the whole thing:  I wanted to see how a gift album should flow from start to finish.  It's one thing to read about it, quite another to see the pictures.  At the very least I thought there should have been some flow charts or diagrams to guide me in the final organization; I wouldn't have to follow them slavishly, but they would have helped me with the \\"big picture\\" much more than just text.  This is a visual medium, after all.<br /> My opinion about that last one, number 6, is based on having read most of the other books that Memory Makers has ever produced.  I am familiar with their publications, which usually have at least a few layouts that \\"wow\\" me and many more that make impressions on my own layouts long after I am done reading.  Making Gift Scrapbooks in a Snap had some nice but unimpressive layouts compared to those other books.  I just didn't come away inspired.  As any scrapbooker knows, that's half the reason to buy these books!<br />So, this is a good solid guide to the basic concept of making quick gift scrapbooks.  I suspect that beginning scrapbookers will be the ones to get the most out of this, while the more advanced album crafters will be wanting a little more.  <BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle.	2004-05-29
US	50986119	R1ZNEUAX77TSA4	1889682322	630510374	A-Z of Ribbon Embroidery	Books	5	43	43	N	N	I could gush on and on about this lovely, useful book	As if they just didn't know the meaning of the word \\"mediocre\\", Country Bumpkin has produced yet another elegant reference guide to the needle arts; this time, it is ribbon embroidery that is demystified for us.   A-Z of Ribbon Embroidery is the latest in a series of practical and beautiful books that I just can't say enough good things about, they are just about that perfect.  Okay, I'm gushing a little here, please bear with me.  Did I mention this book was practically perfect???<br />The best ribbon embroidery designers from Country Bumpkin's publications contributors (Inspirations, Victoria, et al) demonstrate their step-by-step techniques for making their signature blossoms which really do look convincing and 3-d.  As with the other A-Z books, this one is an alphabetical guide to both the basic stitches and the best design applications of its needle art.  It turns out that ribbon embroidery (not necessarily silk per se, either) can create charming illusions of more than just roses - but oh, what an array of gorgeous roses there are!  There are also cherry blossoms, nasturtiums, tulips, carnations and daffodils - whatever flowers you like, plus a few cute characters besides.  I can't get over the carnations - I actually did a double take to be sure it wasn't a photo of real carnations!  I have begun to understand that ribbon embroidery can be a form of painting with silk when skillfully done.<br />Even though this book has lovely photographs and designs it is no coffee table book.  A spiral binding guarantees that AZORE will stand up to its proper use as a reference guide. There is a complete list of materials and an embroidery index included with each design project so that it's easier to refer back to the basic guide when you need to. The photos leave nothing to the imagination, so that even stitching \\"dummies\\" like me can be clear on every step in the process.  Come to think of it, if there is a \\"Silk Ribbon Embroidery for Dummies\\" out there, it couldn't be clearer than this - except that the publishers here have too much respect for their readers to refer to them that wayJ At the same time, I think that there is enough variety of designs that even more experienced stitchers will find some inspiration.  <br />This book will get used frequently by anybody that has the remotest interest in ribbon embroidery.  Well worth the money!<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-05-12

I have just discovered the Orlando books for my kids and they make me wish I'd had them in my own childhood.  Although these were all originally published sometime in the early 20th Century, apparently they had fallen out of print for quite some time and are just now being made available for a whole new generation.<br />Orlando is the original sassy orange tabby cat.  Oh, he doesn't have a lot of dialog but the exquisitely drawn feline expresses more in a facial smirk and body language than that other orange fat cat ever could ever hope to convey with one-liners.  In this adventure, Orlando takes an unexpected detour when his master totes the London bred cat family to a beach day; somehow, he ends up on an ocean liner to France!  The precocious hero is not terribly concerned, and with a delightfully human savoir faire he navigates his way through high and low society, enjoying the best that luxury cruises and jazz clubs have to offer along the way.  <br />The artwork is of the sensitively drawn, gorgepus variety that you just don't see anymore in most children's books.  There is a lot of subtle wit and humor to be discovered in these pages.  Do your family a favor and treat them to at least one Orlando book so that they can experience the pleasure of these genuine masterpieces.  Recommended for cat fans or anybody who just loves great children's picture books.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-05-11

Author Melanie Hendrick starts with a very basic introduction to the tools and materials and leads the reader by baby steps to try out simple techniques such as embossing with a stamped image.  Then there are five projects outlined with photo illustrations, beginning with the easiest to the more advanced level at the end of the book.  There are several sample variations pictured for inspiration.<br />Style-wise, expect very artsy and collage-y results that may remind you of similar card designs by Maryjo McGraw.  Lots of popular craft embellishments are used to achieve the look, such as eyelets, handmade papers and wire mesh.  One of the \\"cards\\" caught my eye, which was a matchbox given new life as a decorated multimedia stamp collage/gift box with a concertina card attached to the lid.<br />I found the book to be comprehensible and nicely done, but rather thin overall.  The price led me to expect something a little more substantial than the five complete project outlines.  Still, a person might be able to use this book as a jumping-off point for a new hobby in rubber stamps.  Conditionally recommended for beginners.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-05-06

This is also a book I can use and learn from for many years to come.<br />Published by Country Bumpkin (of Inspirations and AS&amp;E Magazines), A-Z of Smocking is a true reference manual for all levels of smocking.  IT features a spiral-bound format - something rare but highly appreciated by anyone who actually attempts to use how-to books.  The subjects covered include fabrics, preparation, pleating, needles, threads and over 50 stitches; issues like backsmocking, inserting, color choices, buttonholes in pleats, smocking on knits, picture smocking, geometric smocking, counterchange techniques, freeform smocking...and much more than I can mention in a short book review.  There are frequently Hint boxes accompanying each subject.  Everything is presented in clear, step-by-step layouts that leave little room for misinterpretation.<br />Unlike most reference manuals, it is gorgeous.  A-Z of Smocking also features quality photos and whimsical artwork on nearly every page: in fact, the same photographs from AS&amp;E Magazine's past issues.  This book is everything you might expect from the makers of that attractive publication.<br />I would suggest getting one for yourself regardless of your level of smocking expertise.  You never know when you'll have one of those distracted moments when you forget a stitch or technique.  And if you are ever inspired to give a pleater as a gift to a beginner, it would make the ideal companion gift!<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-04-29

Some colonies, such as the one on planet Balumil, had been lost to their parent civilizations long enough to forget their origins, regressing into a sort of dark ages as their ancestors' technology slowly faded.  Kamoj Argali is a beautiful young ruler of a province on Balumil who is being forced by circumstances into marriage with another governor who could only be described as a sociopath.  Without warning Vyryl Lionstar steps in and claims her away from her sad fate; he has fallen in love with her at first sight.  In the days to come Kamoj learns some uncomfortable truths about not only her planets' people, but the civilizations beyond.  Now, it looks as if Lionstar needs her to stretch her psychological endurance to its limits so that together they can save the Skolian empire together.<br />I got almost what I had expected from this novel.  Yes, it is a romance.  Yes, it is science fiction.  Yes, it is an allegory for quantum physics, employing clever wordplays and terms to complete the analogy.  There is plenty of adventure among the stars, interesting cultural speculation and psychology explored in The Quantum Rose.  The problem is, although I am otherwise well-educated I have never taken a physics class in my life and I cannot remember much about high school chemistry.  Let's just say that the clever physics allegory flew right over my head, leaving me with...a nice romance that did an abrupt about-face in the middle and turned into a pedestrian interstellar adventure.  Maybe if I'd had abetter head for mathematics and science I would have found the alleged brilliance in this book more than enough to make up for its lack plot originality.  As it is however, I can only judge TQR on its storytelling  merit, which was just average in my opinion.<br />Asaro deserves credit for well-thought-out universe building and unusual insight into the complex relationships between her characters.  I think of her writing style as having the potential to become very good, but unrefined here.  Indeed, maybe her later books show improvement.  The romance plotline was nice and standard, but gratifying to somebody who would like to see more such good sci fi/romance hybrids make it into the mainstream.  BUT, unless you're a chemistry/physics/mathematics wiz, there is nothing particularly special about TQR beyond that.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-04-21

Immediately his brother, 4, commandeered it for himself and spent quite a bit of time that afternoon pushing the cardboard honeybee on her path and through the pages to the other sides to continue.  Seeing me do this once was all it took to fascinate them both.<br />The honeybee, which is stored in a plastic pocket on the cover, starts on page one to follow a path of words that curves and turns across the spread to disappear behind a cleverly disguised cut into the next page.  The flowers and objects are identified specifically, like \\"Iris\\" and \\"Cornflower\\", so kids do learn a little uncommon info for their age.  I think that when they try to take over moving the bee for themselves (which is inevitable), they also learn good hand eye coordination skills.  Best of all, the words are like a magic path that has direction, pacing and meaning.  Clever!<br />I'm a big fan of children's picture books that are interactive because they work!  Kids' attention will be riveted, they love to play with the book even when you're not reading to them, and they develop an understanding and appreciation of books.  I remember cherishing Eric Carle's Very Hungry Caterpillar book myself at that age because it was just so cool.  It made learning easy and fun.  This book has a similar appeal, and I would recommend it to anybody whose children respond to that sort of thing.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-03-29

The story is a very common one; baby animal  plays with others, wanders off while exploring and is suddenly lost.  Kind of mediocre in my humble opinion.<BR>But you don't buy this book for the plot!  No, the big draw for Little Lamb is the fascinating flocked pages that give a fun, fuzzy feel and matte appearance to only certain areas of the pictures.  Every page has something to discover as kids have to touch all over to discover what parts are fuzzy and which are smooth.  The lambs are always flocked of course, and other bugs, flowers and animals that should feel furry or soft to the touch are flocked, too.  This will help to teach very little ones about the textures of nature.<BR>I thought this would be a great book to add to the Easter selection on our coffee table.  It doesn't have anything to do with the holiday, but the lamb theme and the pastel colors fit in beautifully.  Most importantly, our kids (2 and 5) enjoy it.  I can recommend this to anybody whose tots like interactive picture books, such as The Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-03-28

At the same time I also purchased some more recent card making books as a way to get caught up quickly on the trends in this craft.  There are a lot of good points about the Card Book:  the projects do cover a wide array of faiths and occasions, the designs are clean, simple and attractive, and some of the cards have elements that can be removed and used as ornaments.  That concept is very original in my opinion. <br />However, The Card Book is after all four years old and showing its age; a lot of evolution in the paper arts has occurred in that time while this book is starting to look out-of-date.  Author Susan Attenborough focuses mainly on pop-up techniques, a little dry embossing and a small smattering of other paper arts.  Meanwhile, the rest of the craft world has discovered vellum, metal embellishments such as eyelets and brads, fibers, stamping, an explosion of patterned papers and accents like microbeads...in fact, a lot of these paper art trends were up and running before this book was published.  It leaves the reader to wonder why they were ignored in a book called THE Card Book.<br />So, I can recommend this to crafters who already know a lot about the other paper arts but would like to try pop-ups and designing more 3-D novelty cards.  But for complete beginners, there are better resources.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-03-28

Something to gather them all in one place, ordered and protected, within easy reach.  A family cookbook perhaps?  Meals and Memories:  How to Create Keepsake Cookbooks answered my need and gave me a few new ideas for wonderful keepsake cookbooks. <br />Author Kathy Steligo really leads the reader by the hand through basic steps to collecting, organizing and designing keepsake cookbooks.  Before you start on your treasury of recipes, there are many points to consider depending on what the purpose of your keepsake cookbook will be, or really who will be the main user(s).  If you're like me, you wouldn't have thought ahead about the differences between a cookbook for your own home and one destined to be reproduced for a fundraiser, for instance.  When do you most need page protectors, and which type of binding system is best for personal gifts?  Is it better to handwrite or use computer journaling?  How could you include the original recipe cards on your pages?  Never here, the solutions are in here.<br /> Now a caution to all you scrapbookers:  this book is focused more on the organizational, practical issues about preserving favorite recipes.  You don't consult it for cute page ideas about recipes in your scrapbook layouts, you read it to find out how to make a complete, working volume for use in the kitchen.  Sure there are some tips on decorating and design, references to other books and resources to teach you further about design and journaling, even an introduction to archival preservation basics and techniques, but that's not the main point here.  This is a no-nonsense guide to getting it all done in a simple, orderly fashion that leaves plenty of room for personalization and artistic flair, but at your own discretion.<br />All that being said, I learned a lot about keepsake recipesand even came away with inspiration for how to do my own collected recipes books for family gifts.  If you are serious about preserving this part of your family heritage, or just want to remember good times with friends and food, this is the ideal introduction to the topic.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-03-25

The next word was \\"collage\\".  I think those two concepts neatly sum up the style and involvement level you can expect from this multimedia craft book.<br />Author MaryJo McGraw is clearly an experienced artist who has explored many techniques, but whose first love is obviously the paper arts.  Although this is a book on greeting cards, there were a lot of projects that would work on a different scale for other purposes, such as embellishing scrapbooks; and many of them could be frame able art in their own right.  The designs and color choices reflect rich, muted tones and multilayers of materials such as fibers, charms, gold leaf, wires, inks, watch pebbles, beads, punches, stamped papers and photos.  Often the card shapes and closures are not the standard rectangular format.  The processes are carefully explained and illustrated as though to first-timers, but the results will make you look like a terribly sophisticated artist.<br />If you're hoping for ideas that would make for good quantity mailings such as invitations, be aware that most people would probably not have the time or money to make these cards in bulk:  these are complex labors of love that are definitely not suited to mass production.  Never once did I read a suggestion that the reader purchase ready-made embellishments or stickers, because the emphasis here is on handcrafting rather than time efficiency.  For the crafter who has special, personal sentiments to express however, these are the ideal medium for that individual touch to the recipient. <BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-03-12

Ever find yourself wanting to put more of an individual touch on your Christmas cards?  Do readymade cards from the store seem a little too \\"canned\\"  -- or maybe just boring? Perhaps the email invites to your friend's shower got buried with all the junkmail and you need something that will get people's attention. You don't want to spend all day on it, but there must be some way to rev up your cards or just get beyond the generic, fake-sentimentality that has become the greeting card industry.<br />Better Homes and Gardens has compiled a great resource here for the crafter who wants to send something other than the Hallmark standard-issue greeting cards and invitations.  Handmade Greetings for All Occasions really does cover most possible situations that call for cards (except for St. Patrick's day - wait, I never sent cards for St. Patty's day anyway!).    True to the style of their magazine publication, BH&amp;G's designs are contemporary, fun, tongue-in-cheek, cute, elegant, whimsical, classy, lovely, or any sort of appropriate mode you could ask for; and without exception they stand out.  The ones that caught my eye, for example:<br />A very girly purse-shaped card with an actual Velcro closure (perfect for my sister's birthday)<BR>A valentine's card with beginner-level quilling design all over the heart shape - easy and elegant!<BR>Autumn greeting cards with embossed papers and gilded leaves - rich looking, but fast to assemble<BR>Colorful birthday cards with candle detailing baked from clay<BR>Christmas greetings with beaded motifs and appliqués.  <BR>Stamp-embossed wedding card in vellum and silver; not exactly revolutionary, but simply lovely.<br />The techniques/materials used to make the cards range all over the craft world today, but are applied with a light touch (I wish I had room to name them all in this review).  For instance, a few of the projects call for stamps, others show you how to make accents with clay, wires, beads, botanicals, ribbons...thefamiliar array of skills to paper crafters and scrapbookers, but explained and illustrated at the beginner level for the rest of us.  If you are not already a crafter, you will have to make some initial investment in tools and materials to get started with most of these projects. You will get a brief exposure to all different kinds of paper crafts being used today, and maybe come away with a new hobby or two.  In my case though I had a lot of tools floating about because I scrapbook.<br />I have looked at other card making books and find that often, the involvement or the investment is either too much for my purposes (such as making 40 invites for that baby shower) or so simplistic/standard that you may as well not bother wasting your time with handmades.  HGFAO strikes just the right balance, so that the crafter can mass produce many of the projects for larger mailings or spend more time embellishing custom cards that become keepsakes.  Let me reassure you that none of these projects look mass produced though.  You will get lots of credit from your friends and family for being the artist who took the time to make it especially for them.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-03-12

The Paradise War by Stephen Lawhead begins a series built around one of these \\"British-isms\\":  ordinary, humble folk from our dreary mundane world stumbling into a magical parallel world quite by accident.  Unlike the obvious Chronicles of Narnia-type examples however, this series was written purely for grownup audiences.<br />Lewis is a graduate student at Oxford; one of those bookish, plain sorts who would never get any female attention if it weren't for his handsome, impulsive roommate Simon.  One day they decide to take a road trip north to investigate some paranormal happenings reported in a tabloid.  Simon ends up crossing over into the parallel world unwittingly, and a few months later a frantic and confused Lewis follows to \\"rescue\\" him.  Instead, Lewis finds that Simon has passed four years as a warrior in the fantastic and barbaric Otherworld of Albion and has settled in happily.  In order to survive in this savage and beautiful land, Lewis must also undergo an extreme transformation.  Meanwhile, the barrier between the worlds is wearing thin and leaking through to England.  Disaster for both worlds is inevitable unless Lewis can convince his friend to return with him and find a solution.<br />Lawhead depicts this alternate realm of Albion as a legendary paradise that is based on a lot of research into Celtic folklore and traditions.  I can really respect the labor of love that this kind of world-building represents.  The author is also careful to remain true to the harsher realities of survival in a primitive culture; there are battles and grim bloodshed depicted (fans will get their share of this Lawhead staple), almost a surreal counterpoint to the lovely land and peoples he describes.  There are also spiritual themes weaving through the plot: the evils of pride and folly, and how these things have far-reaching consequences throughout time and space;  providence; and inner transformation being more important than anything physical.  Lawhead delivers these messages masterfully and without preaching.  <br />The Song of Albion promises to be a rich, absorbing read if this first book is any example. My reaction to TPW was enthusiastic, even though I do not normally seek out fantasy that involves so much war strategy and action thrills.  Despite a few choppy transition passages, the storytelling is solid.  I anticipate picking up book two immediately to continue the adventure.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-03-09

Four and a half stars, really.  I'll explain that in a moment.<br />I have never watched Sandi Genovese's cable tv show on scrapbooking, so I was a little hesitant to purchase Three Dimensional Scrapbooks.  Now that I have had a chance to read it however I'm glad that I took the risk; the page designs inside are a dream come true for somebody at my intermediate experience level with a taste for artistic, understated design.<br />Sandi presents us with some very gorgeous layouts that involve elements slightly raised from the background.  These elements could be titles, accents, photos or even journaling blocks.  A few of the pages merely have the effective illusion of dimension by the creative use of papers.  The color choices are predominately soft and toned down (although any of the layouts can be recreated with any color scheme the scrapbooker wishes).  Texture is incorporated into many of the pages using fibers, fabric, cords etc.  The result is a design that looks like it's begging for you to reach out and touch it, just to make sure it is real.<br /> The book is divided into chapters on Basics, Paper, Fabric, Metal, Keepsakes, Beads &amp; Baubles, and Exotic Elements.  I found that there is a nice balance of techniques that could be handcrafted with common scrapbooking materials as well as the convenient store-bought variety.  I also recognized several coordinated designer papers in the projects from the likes of Anna Griffin and Bazzil - making it very easy to achieve that perfect color and pattern mix.  And although many of the pages are involved works of art that have to be crafted slowly and carefully, several of the pages could be put together quickly by somebody with a small bit of experience already under her belt.  In all, this book is very encouraging and inspiring.  I will be using its layouts for a long time to come.<br />So why not the full five stars?   Well, my conscience was pricked a bit in some areas. For instance, she does state in the introduction that this book is for people who have some basic experience already, but the author showcases a few lovely pages which take very advanced, specialized skills to pull off nicely.  A perfect example of this are two layouts that call for quilled accents.  There is a small sidebar with one illustration of each quill pattern used and no other instruction on how to do it.  Anybody who's ever tried this knows that you can't learn quilling that way!  Also, some examples of flaws that could have benefited from some editing;  leaving out mention of tools needed to bend and twist wire, no explanation of mitering corners in a pleated paper project, and calling for seventeen inch long pieces of paper (I've yet to see that for sale in scrapbook stores - where do we get it?).  Despite the fact that I just happen to know how to miter and quill, I realize that these are skills that the typical scrapper probably won't have, so in all fairness I can't give this book a full five star rating.<br />Basically, this is a fine collection of elegant, inspired layouts that make use of dimension to add great interest to scrapbooking pages.  Strongly recommended.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-02-19

On the heels of their first photo cropping book (Creative Photo Cropping for Scrapbookers), Memory Makers raises the bar yet again with Cutting Edge Photo Cropping for Scrapbookers.  The title is a fitting description of the samples inside, which showcase the latest, most innovative photo cropping ideas out there.  <br />CEPC will show you how to turn your photographs into works of art for your scrapbook page.  Borrowing techniques and concepts from varied sources, the Memory Makers magazine folks have, to use another cliché, really pushed the envelope on what can be done to make your photos the focus of your layouts.  Your tools are usually as basic as scissors, rulers, craft knife, paper trimmer and a cutting mat; now and then more specialized items are called for, such as punches and puzzle templates.  The step-by-step illustrations will instruct you easily.  And although the finished piece will appear to be anything but simple to the viewer, you will be able to complete most of these without any aggravation or special training.  The look of your picture art will be clean, fresh and graphic.<br />Now a word to croppers who have already read the first photo cropping book by Memory Makers.  This second offering does offer over one hundred new photo cropping ideas as the cover promises.  However, many of them are redux of ideas from book #1 with variations and twists.  For example, weaving strips of b&amp;w and color copies together - that sounds familiar, doesn't it?  But here we see it used in new silhouettes and layered with other cropped shapes.  Other déjà vu techniques include mosaics, self-framing photos, photo letters and slicing lines and curves into the photos.  Note again however that these are all-new examples and they are expanded upon from the original. There are also a lot of truly new techniques, such as making shadowboxes from photos and adding dimension by curling. You can still come away with fresh inspiration.  <br />There are areas of CEPC devoted to using photos to make embellishments and page accents, such as tags, shaker boxes and hinged doors.  While I did enjoy these charming techniques, I question that they really had a place in a book that is professing to make the photos the stars of the page, not sideshows.  However, they still did involve photo cropping.<br />CEPC would be a great book for first-time scrappers who need inexpensive ways to make standout pages, or anybody looking for more fabulous layout ideas.  Croppers who already own the first book however may want to pass on this one.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle.	2004-02-16

This is something that has been needed in the scrapbooking world for quite some time.  Memory Makers magazine rallies to our cause (that is, the cause of making sense out of the \\"scrap market\\" for us customers) once again with Scrapbook Embellishments (Masters series).<br />The book is heftier than most of its kind.  I soon realized that that's because:<BR>1. The scrapbooking craft has been gaining popularity - and new materials-for quite a few years now<BR>2. The creators of this book care enough to devote entire pages to about two example photos each of scrapbook layouts that feature the embellishments being taught.  This is great for readers who don't want to feel overwhelmed by a lot of detail at once.  And it also means that there's room to size the photos decently, alongside the captions and helpful text.  Result:  no eyestrain, good page design.<br />I particularly like the way SEMS is organized.  Instead of trying to treat it chronologically (boring) or overanalyzing the topic, the author(s) have gathered it into five simple categories; Paper (vellum, tags, stickers, you know the drill), Textiles (lace, fabrics, etc), Metal, Baubles (glass, glitter and the like) and Organics (flowers, leaves, shells, etc).  Archival issues with each category are discussed briefly.  Processes are documented simply alongside the example.  Outstanding sample pages from the magazine illustrate each one.<br />My one concern with SEMS is that like many other books of its type it is doomed to be outdated one day as many newer embellishment trends hit the stores all the time.  The good news is that the creators of Memory Makers are cutting edge enough that they've stayed on top of the trends, even anticipated them in my experience.  So, this book will remain current for a while yet.  <br />Recommended as a reference book and for great page layout ideas,too.  Get it while it's hot!<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-02-13
US	50986119	R3VQQKCF7EX8VL	189212730X	212951263	Outstanding Scrapbook Pages	Books	5	60	65	N	Y	A rich gallery of scrapbook pages from 96 to 03	Memory Makers magazine has been on newsstands since 1996 - the early days of the scrapbooking explosion into mainstream American culture.  From that time the founder and editorial staff have witnessed not only the growth of this popular craft, but the births of all the trends and styles that followed.  This book, Outstanding Scrapbook Pages, is a summary of their most distinctive and significant reader-submitted pages that have been featured in the magazine until early 2003.<br />According to the Introduction, the 250 page selections were difficult to choose.  The staff had to review \\"every page of every issue\\" since the beginning before voting on favorites.  The criteria for being included were:  How influential was that page on later scrapbooking trends?  Were the techniques extraordinary, the photos exceptional, or perhaps the journaling memorable?  Was there something unique in the design/idea that made it stand out? Based on what I have seen here, every page in this book answers yes to at least one of those questions.<br />I happen to have collected several of the other books published by Memory Makers, all of which showcase page examples of the techniques being discussed.  I wasn't terribly surprised to recognize many of the same pages here that were used previously in their other books; makes sense to me, because after all, the most outstanding examples of techniques for their teaching books would probably be influential, memorable, and/or extraordinary in general.  Still, this book was a wee bit redundant for me.  On the other hand, readers who are new to scrapbooking will appreciate the quick retrospective on the craft, which helps them catch up to modern trends in one read.  Longtime readers of the magazine may cherish this nice collection of favorites, especially if it means that they can finally donate a few shelf-fulls of back issues to the local library in exchange for one slim volume that chronicles the cream of the crop. And  based on the general excellence of this gallery of scrapbooking art, I can heartily recommend it to anybody looking for page ideas.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-02-11

Books	5	274	278	N	N	Fabulous technique for productive, organic gardens	I believe that when it comes to books presenting new ways of doing anything, the only testimony that counts is that which comes from firsthand experience.  Well folks, I'm here to tell you after a year of gardening the lasagna way that my firsthand experience shows this book is one of the wisest investments any gardener can make.  Let me tell you about my 2003 garden.<br />First, a short outline of lasagna gardening technique:  soak b&amp;w newspapers in water, then overlap sections in a single layer directly on top of premarked sod area.  This smothers the weeds/grass underneath.  Then put a 4 inch layer of moistened peat moss over that, followed by a moist layer of organic shredded green material, followed by another layer of peat moss, followed by a layer of moist compost or yard waste, repeat the peat moss/organic matter pattern until your bed is built up to at least 18 inches high.  Finish with compost on top, then either let it break down for a few months for certain crops or plant seeds and transplants directly into the matrix by pushing aside layers and inserting.    As the layers break down, the earthworms will be eating the sod and breaking up the newspapers, mixing the layers together for you.  The final result is an organic, self-tilled soil that's rich and free of disease and weed seeds.   It's so simple. <br />Note:  the author did neglect to mention the importance of wetting down each layer as you build the beds.  I only figured this out because I had made compost before and I knew you needed moist materials for it to work.<br />In late fall of 2002 I built a 5 foot by 25 foot border bed for perennial flowers the lasagna way after reading Patricia Lanza's book.  It sounded almost too good to be true - no digging, no tilling, no weeding?  What was the catch, I asked myself.  When I was done I planted perennials taken from four inch pots, watered them in, and left them for the winter rains to take care of (we can do that in So. Cal, hee hee).  They settled in nicely and grew steadily, but it was cool weather so the roots were doing most of the growth at that time.  A few months later as top growth appeared I was encouraged to build more lasagna beds in my vegetable garden - two 5 by 5 raised beds to go with my other two traditionally tilled raised beds (those were a lot of work, double digging, sifting rocks, mixing compost, etc.  I wish now that I had known about the lasagna method a few years ago!).  After about two hour's work I was done layering my new vegetable beds and watered them down to compost a little.  In late May, I transplanted sweet peppers and basil starts to one lasagna bed and planted cantaloupes and flowers in the other.<br />Those two lasagna beds outperformed the traditional beds in every way.  That summer I harvested more sweet peppers than ever before.  It was my first try growing cantaloupes, so I have no previous crops to compare, but they did well and I harvested quite a few delicious, sun-sweetened cantaloupes from that bed.  Meanwhile the flowers seemed to love the soil in my perennial bed, and they grew to huge proportions, filling in the space nicely by season's end.  As promised, there was little watering and even less weeding.  As a bonus, I never fertilized because the soil was already so rich in composting organic matter.  Best of all, no soil-borne diseases!  This was an organic gardener's paradise.<br />Author Patricia Lanza uses plenty of real-life examples from her own gardens to illustrate the effectiveness of this technique.  She explains in detail how lasagna gardening differs from traditional tilling and double digging, what the benefits are and which crops need to wait while the layers compost down and which can be put in right away.  There is an alphabetical listing of ways to plant annuals and seeds in lasagna beds, a plethora of tips on maximizing your space and innovating ways to grow vertically if need be.  There are also garden plans for flower borders and perennialbeds grouped according to watering and sunshine needs.<br />Please don't be afraid to break with \\"tradition\\" - you could save not only your garden tool budget, but your back as well.  And if the promise of all those fruits, veggies and flowers with less work and more pleasure isn't enough for you, then you must really love that rototiller!<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-02-09

You'll wish you'd had it before you selected all the wrong things on your wedding registry.  But when you look back ten years from now and add up all the money, time and aggravation you've saved after following the advice in Gear For Your Kitchen, you'll get that little smile that only comes with the special joy of smugness.  And after all, you will have one kick-a** (and uncluttered) kitchen!<br />Author, director and chef Alton Brown brings his trademark bottom-line style to GFYK.  To make it easier to use as a spot reference, it is divided into sections:  Pots and Pans, Sharp Things, Small Things with Plugs, Kitchen tools Unplugged, Storage and Containment, and Safety and Sanitation.  The short introduction at the beginning orients the reader to some guidelines about organizing, how to decide an item's keep-or-toss value, and rules that will keep you grounded in reality as you shop (and less likely to fall for sales ploys). A good sample quote on knife salesjargon:  \\"If I'm getting ready to go into battle, I'd almost certainly want my sword to be full tang, but if the most violent task I'm to encounter is cutting through a chicken, I can think of about six characteristics of a knife that are more important.\\"   This  section alone redeems the book's cover price very quickly.<br />What really makes GFYK -- and AB - stand out from others however is the effortless teacherly approach the author takes.  Just as with his tv series Good Eats, AB explains the logic, physics and application of tools, techniques and gadgets, but get this:  it's all in simple, no-nonsense language so that you can really learn what you are doing, instead of following directions obediently.  Applying your knowledge becomes easy at that point on.  Really, no straining or note-taking required here to suddenly realize which pots you'll need for your favorite recipes for instance.  He just slips it on in unnoticed, and dang it, you're an educated consumer that can make intelligent choices.  How does he do it?<br />As an added bonus, there are recipes spliced into areas relevant to the tools being discussed, little sidebar blurbs and comments on trivia, and often, photos of his personal items.  AB includes tips on where to obtain some of the obscure ones.  But my hands-down favorite thing about GFYK are the little gems on improvising and trouble shooting.  Need a shield for your immersion blender (so that everything doesn't splatter out the top of the container)?  Cut a hole in a cheap frisbee and slide it on through.  Want a roaster that's also good for casseroles and baking bread?  Two shallow terra cotta flowerpots  should do the trick. I ask you, how can one resist the charm of learning how to makeshift a smoker for under fifty bucks out of common household items?  I might add, you will be able to disassemble it and store it offseason in the garden shed...or just reuse the parts when you're done!<br />I hope I've convinced you that you do need this book unless you are already a veritable expert on kitchen tools.  Save yourself and your counter space, free up your closets and get cooking!<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-01-30

Romantics who studied art history, and 2.  People hoping for a historically detailed account of 17th Century Flanders.  Romantics who love Vermeer's paintings will finish this book disillusioned and sad.  Historians will get very little detail to satisfy  their desire for a complete picture of this period.  On the other hand, those hoping for a good novel with historical references and overtones, or perhaps a glimpse into the process of artists in Vermeer's time, will enjoy Girl with a Pearl Earring very much.<br />GWAPE is mostly historical fiction about a beautiful teenage girl's years spent as a maid in the service of famous painter Vermeer's household.  Griet is a hardworking, intelligent sort who has wonderful work ethics and really just wants to help out her parents, who have fallen on hard times.  During her stay with this family she unexpectedly becomes an apprentice of sorts to the painter after he realizes she has some undeveloped talent (which a girl of her station would never realize, normally).  Although the cover art hints at a juicy affair between the two, this is just a cheap marketing ploy.  The real romance is between Griet and her discovery of art.<br />It's not that author Tracy Chevalier didn't do her research.  The parts of this book that talk of camera obscura, how paints were mixed, the hierarchy of a wealthy household and the social customs of that age speak of a great deal of research and indeed, insight.  Without being any kind of expert myself I'd bet that Chevalier studied these things in great depth.  It's just that life outside of the domestic sphere is sketched in only very sparingly.  One does not get a very fulfilling view of Flanders through this book.<br />The overstory about maid Griet and her \\"sensual awakening\\" to the art in light and the objects around her is beautifully done.  I could not ask for a better description.  What troubled me was that every other character in this tale was completely blind to anything but their own prejudices, petty concerns and agendas - including Vermeer himself!  Each person sees Griet either as a commodity or a threat, based on stereotypes or their own insecurities.  To Vermeer she is a \\"muse\\" to inspire him, even at the expense of exhausting her with too much work and endangering her position in the household.  To his wife Catharina, Griet is a sneaky young upstart who coveted her man.  To the children and servants Griet is a drudge without a life outside their house.  To Veermeer's patron she is an easy victim for his advances.  Even her own parents see her as nothing more than a means by which they could obtain meat and financial security through her engagement.  Griet's feelings and precarious situation never enter anybody's mind save perhaps Vermeer's mother-in-law's.  Her resulting loneliness and isolation gradually backs her into a corner where she has no other options but to play the game by rules she detests.  Her reward is more slander and work.<BR> <BR>I have no doubt that the scenario described in this book was a common problem for poor girls in this historical period.  My objection is to its use as a device to manipulate the reader's sympathies.  Do we need another story of yet one more victim of outdated patriarchal evils?<br />Worse, Vermeer is forever ruined for me.  While as an art student I could appreciate his paintings on a purely aesthetic level, now I can't help but think about poor Griet and Chevalier's speculations of the stories behind them.  It leaves a bitter aftertaste.  I can now only think of Vermeer as a self-centered boor who just happpened to be blessed with extraordinary gifts.<br />Yes, GWAPE was well-written, enjoyable even.  Though the last 100 pages I couldn't put it down.  Yet, I will always be sorry now that I read it.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-01-30

This is another time-tested classic by author/illustrator Eric Carle.  It opens asking a brown bear what he sees, and he replies, and the next page is the animal that he saw, and he is asked what he sees, and so on and so on.<br />As you might expect from Carle, his simple but wonderful illustrations are a big part of the appeal of this book. Each two-page layout is a colorful animal centered on a white background, and that's it.  Kids will effortlessly learn colors and animal names as you read it to them, and maybe a little sequential logic.  I'd say it's a great book for ages 1 through 5. (At least, my five-year-old still likes to sit in while I read it to my two-year-old).<br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-01-30

What would you give for one last chance to take a shot at those dreams - or even the first chance you'd never gotten?  More importantly, what would that dream cost you now in consequences?<br />This is the dark side of everybody's second-chance fantasies; consequences.  Author D. Mikels' Walk On is a novel that takes an unusual risk in exploring the true exchange value of one 35-year-old man's sudden, supernatural opportunity to play college football for the Oklahoma Sooners.  Thwarted in his youth by a body not designed for athletics, Mike Wilson cannot enjoy the wonderful young family or his business success now that all of his inappropriate ambitions are supposedly behind him.  On the other hand his cousin Justin, 19, is squandering his untapped physical talents on a dead end job following high school graduation.  Years of seething come to a head one fateful night.   Weird mystical forces converge in an unexpected way to give both men each what they think they've always wanted.<br />Now I'm no stranger to supernatural fiction; you could even say it's my drug of choice.  Sports, however...let's just say that not much of my gray matter is given over to Superbowl scores.  Several passages in Walk On described football plays in detail. A sports fan would probably consider those passages integral, and say that they added to the overall authenticity of the story.  I shamefully admit that I skimmed past those areas and went on to the larger story, which was easily comprehensible to me without them.  Why would I even bother with a book about sports then?  Because this one was recommended to me as a durn fine novel.  And it is.<br />The themes of ambition, regret and nostalgia are wonderfully universal in Walk On, and make for a tale that has an appeal similar to that of Field of Dreams.  The plot becomes a little predictable about halfway through, but with enough tease to keep the pages turning.  I found the writing style made for a quick, easy read.  Author D. Mikels continues to progress and mature as a writer, and I look forward to his next offering.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-01-27
US	50986119	R13U4QYEXQGSTE	0380818604	84144543	The Curse of Chalion	Books	5	93	96	N	Y	The start of another beloved series, I trust!	There are a few things I have come to expect from Lois McMaster Bujold:<BR>1. Intelligent and atypical main characters<BR>2. Excellent world-building<BR>3. Da*n good storytelling<BR>4. Original ideas<BR>The Curse of the Chalion did not disappoint me one iota on any count.<br />Since the Editorial review does such a good job of summing up the plot, I'll forego that part in my review here.  Fans of the author's SF series may be a little apprehensive about Bujold's foray into Fantasy; let me reassure them right now that they shouldn't be.  Although her only previous Fantasy effort, The Spirit Ring, was a little below her usual level of excellence, TCOTC shows none of TSR's hesitant plotting.  The story forges ahead fully confident and daring.<br />In keeping with what you might expect from an author who earned her stripes for @ 20 years in SF, the fantasy world of TCOTC has underpinnings of logic and a natural order to stabilize the magical flourishes.  This is a universe in which magic is a power much like gunpowder:  the common folk may know about it, could theoretically get their hands on it and use it, but rarely have the desire to considering the well-known risks and consequences.  Rather than being used as a device to solve plot problems or dazzle the reader, magic is left to the Gods...except by the foolish who just insist on making life a little too interesting for everybody else.<br />The central character, Cazaril, is far and away the scene stealer in this book however.  A brilliant minor nobleman who was  betrayed four years ago into foreign slavery, he returns destitute to his birth land looking for a place to belong.  It becomes obvious to everybody that his honor and wisdom are not to be underestimated, particularly when a few political enemies make that very mistake.  Underdogs that rise and outshine the proud are a particular specialty of Bujold's; if Cazaril seems a little familiar to us longtime readers, remember that we wouldn't have our heroes any other way.<br />Curse of the Chalion is a marvelous introduction to this new fantasy universe; it had that gripping, can't-put-down quality somewhere after the first few chapters.  I now look forward to the next outing into this fascinating landscape of swordsmanship, intrigue and theological musings.  In all, a brilliant read.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-01-25

Yeah, I know we have our urban crime, poor air quality and bottom-notch public school systems (don't get me started..), but Holy Cannoli, what a place to vacation!<br />Offbeat Overnights is a short guide to the quirkier spots to rest on your travels through the Golden State.  Every non-institutionalized hotel, motel, B&amp;B and Inn is reviewed briefly in this book with one condition:  it must have a twist.  Some charming, silly or just bizarre aspect of your overnight experience must make it noteworthy in a world gone amok with the generic.  Both the famous and \\"secret\\" lodgings are covered here.  For example, we've all heard of the barbie-pink Madonna Inn at San Luis Obispo with its themed rooms (reason enough to visit right there), but would you have known to stop by:<BR>· The Chimney Sweep Inn in Solvang - themed after the Chronicles of Narnia both inside and out of its six cottages.  <BR>· St. Orres lodge in Mendocino with its Russian-inspired copper domes and handcrafted wooden filigree.  You can feast at the acclaimed restaurant on locally-caught and -harvested gourmet creations.<BR>· An Elegant Victorian Mansion in Eureka , lovingly restored and entirely run by the owners who love to dress up in period costumes to complete the authentic Victorian atmosphere.  Unbelievable attention to historical detail!<BR>· Shadow Mountain Ranch in Julian, which has eight wooded acres and themed cottages such as the Tree House (yes, it is), Enchanted Cottage and Gnome House.  I just have to see this one to believe it.<BR>· Coronado House in Coronado, which is for legal purposes a dance lesson package that features a free overnight stay in one of its guest rooms.  The owner calls it \\"Dance and Doze\\" (D&amp;D) and creates authentic Leganese-American breakfasts and picnic baskets.<br />The author has personally visited each of these over five hundred establishments and provides a short summaryand basic info in the listings.  If I had one beef with this guide it would be that there weren't enough pictures, but the descriptions entice nonetheless.  There is an undercurrent of enthusiasm for the delightfully uncommon experiences to be had at these offbeat inns run by  inventive owners.  She does state in the introduction however that no matter how wonderful, any place that wasn't clean, friendly or unusual enough was simply eliminated.<br />There is ever so much more to be explored, and suddenly I feel that I never really knew my home state.  This book was printed eight years ago to date, so much of the info may be outdated by now.  No doubt several wacky Californians have added new fab getaways since then.  Would an updated reprint be too much to hope for?  Meanwhile, there's plenty here to occupy my vacation planning for the next decade.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-01-24
US	50986119	R1ZUPWRYTO0DPW	0745918727	328094300	Empyrion (2 Books)	Books	5	16	20	N	Y	Dystopia and Utopia fantastic	Take a colony on an alien planet, throw in a plague and a civil war, and cut off all contact from its parent organization for about three thousand years.  Don't forget, they still have their atomic weapons.  Result:  Empyrion, split into Fierra and Dome, with a wasteland in between.<BR>In Part One:  After landing on Empyrion, the four companions Treet, Yarden, Pizzle and pilot Crocker are literally stunned.  Apparently, the colony established four years ago (by Earth's reckoning) has somehow gone terribly wrong; a backward, almost Orwellian government has taken over and the society and technology have degenerated.  Without the clear guidance of their earthly parent corporation (Cynetics), the humans reverted to a rigid caste system to keep order.  Erecting their own form of religion came next - essentially a kind of demon worship.  Paranoia ruled their leaders' decisions, and individual human welfare was not a consideration against the status quo.  A true dystopia, the fruit of fragile human understanding untempered by love.<br />Orion Treet is our main interface to Empyrion.  A historian and a writer, he is able to maintain some emotional distance from what is happening around him; his friends are not so fortunate.  Yarden, a sympath, is traumatized by her stay in Dome .  She is able to sense a malevolent presence that the others cannot. Pizzle, a genius, had a backbreaking, filthy job in the lowest caste and couldn't wait to leave. Crocker was severely injured at first contact, comatose for most of his stay, but even still there is a hole in his memory during which something sinister happened...<BR> <BR>Part Two:  the companions have somehow made it across the wasteland to the smaller human settlement. This is Fierra, a true utopia and a foretaste of Heaven in this life.  Fierrans have relied on the Infinite (God) for guidance and wisdom for over a millennium, ever since the atomic Holocaust.  The results were not only a beautiful city in harmony with nature but abeautiful people in harmony with each other.  Their vow of non-aggression may now backfire on them as Dome turns a paranoid eye toward Fierra once again...<br />Empyrion was not perfectly plotted and written.  The first half drags in areas, has a generally unsatisfying feel to it which I believe is because author Stephen Lawhead offers a hasty sketch of the main characters and then neglects them to explore the wonders of the alien world; their inner lives are largely unexplored until the second half.  A pet peeve of mine surfaces in the form of a romantic subplot between Treet and not one but three knockout females, but don't get excited - I don't think I'm spoiling much by revealing that they come to nothing and serve no real purpose in the plot.  Worse, the reader is left wondering what they saw in him to begin with; Treet seems to have the EQ of a jackrabbit.  Finally, Lawhead resorts to some generic descriptions of what is by all accounts supposed to be an exotic and interesting world.  He could have spent a few more imaginative words revealing the physical Empyrion to us.<br />All these flaws drop away from memory when the magic of this alien place becomes apparent in random moments of storytelling brilliance.  I recall vividly the sensory weirdness Lawhead evoked with a narrative about a nameless disease that cocooned its victims in shells of their own flesh.  The haunting loneliness of the desert wastelands and the quiet green crunch of the forests crept into my soul as I read.  Lawhead chronicles the spiritual journeys of the travellers through sensitive inner dialogs.  And finally, nobody does war strategy and battle sequences like this author.  For such gratifying passages I am willing to forgive much.<br />So perhaps Empyrion was not a complete five stars in every respect.  Since the whole added up to more than the sum of its parts, however, it may be read by sci fi fans without reservation.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2004-01-09
US	50986119	R1SA14OQRYLDP2	0060256656	945451465	The Giving Tree	Books	5	49	87	N	N	Sweet, sad story of unconditional love	I read this book to my two year old son for the first time a few years ago.  The obvious metaphor, that of the tree being a mother whose son is destined to leave her someday, struck me right off.  I was tearing up about halfway through.  What mother of any child -- male or female -- doesn't secretly dread that far-off event, even while it signals a positive step in the natural order of things?  That's a universal theme and part of nearly everybody's life at one time.  So maybe it's a little manipulative on that level.<br />After I was done  reading my boy bounced up and went into our back yard to play.  In passing he actually stopped and hugged the big old pepper tree!  At that point I realized a new metaphor for this story, and a deeper level of meaning to it that had touched me as well.  You see, the tree also represents God.  He loves us from the beginning of our lives and nurtures us with wholesome gifts (represented here by apples and leaves) and we accept this with joy that gives His love right back.  Children have that universally satisfying relationship with God even while they may have no name for it.  They are able to simply enjoy the truly important things in a way adults have trouble with.<br />You'll notice that when the boy gets a little older he spends less and less time with the Tree.  His growing up signals the start of worldliness and materialism.  He comes back as a teenager and asks for money.  Then he comes back and asks for a house, and later a boat.  The things of the world never truly satisfy him the way fellowship with the Tree did earlier, but it takes a while to realize this.  In the end, he recognizes the truth and comes back to the only source of true love and peace he ever really had, and can accept the simple pleasure of sitting with the Tree once again.  In the same way, we get distracted by worldly concerns and materialism as adults and tend to stray from God, only to realize after the best years of our life are spent that we shouldhave spent more of them with Him.<br />God's selfless, unconditional love for His children (and the generally ungrateful attitude we throw right back most of the time) is so poignantly portrayed by this metaphor of the Giving Tree that I think it's better than any metaphor I've found in the bible! In the deepest sense, my tears were in recognition of my own ingratitude and selfishness as contrasted by the love of God.  For one small minute, I was able to see the human condition from His perspective and weep for it.  That was precious to me, and something I will always have Silverstein to thank for.  <br />I can understand the interpretations of The Giving Tree from an environmental perspective and from a feminist perspective as well, and understand why so many people object to it.  Truthfully, we don't really know which of these many messages Shel Silverstein intended, or if he even believed in God or not.  But God does work in mysterious ways, and I truly believe He used Shel's work to send a message of His own to those of us who can receive it.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2003-12-29
US	50986119	R1MW074JEXHS4Y	0553581309	328863178	Biting the Sun	Books	5	34	40	N	Y	This lovely, ghastly mess that is the human condition	A soulless people living in an artificial biosphere in the desert.  An advanced civilization turned in upon itself as it reaches levels of hedonism and depravity far surpassing that of the late Roman Empire. A picture of horror disguised as the ultimate beauty and pleasure.<br />Tanith Lee has created a world in which humans are the obsolete masters of a society so advanced that death itself is impossible.  Life on the other hand is an endless pursuit of pleasure for plesaure's sake.  No material possession, no experience cannot be had by the elite Jang class of citizens (you could even say it was considered their duty to experiment with play).  Work is performed entirely by robot automatons so that humans can indulge themselves in whatever way suits their fancies.  Want to try a new body?  Commit suicide and come back with a different look, a different gender, antennae if you like.  Nothing is criminal or forbidden save one thing:  murder.<br />The depiction of this world ( called 4-B) and an unusual young heroine who dares to buck the system to find meaning in her life resonated with me.  Seeing her exhaust every avenue available to her for true self-discovery was a painful and beautiful thing; eventually, she realized that there was something terribly wrong with a society in which God and morals had no place.  Therefore, the only option left was to flee from the protection of the AI overseers and their sheltered paradise to become truly human and mortal at last.  Reading this was like watching a soul being born.<br />The author was not exactly covering new territory in her plot line; it became obvious to me halfway through that this was a variation on the popular Biblical tale of the Fall.  Whether the Jang caste (perpetual teenagers of a sort) represents Angels or Mankind in a weird state of depraved innocence is vague, but the central characters all became human at some point.  Rather than symbolizing a sad end to a good thing, however, the outcast Jang experienced a sort of spiritual and physical awakening, an uplifting if you will.  This is truly a tale of redemption where life can bloom in the desert once again.<br />With some of the most lyrical prose ever to be found in SF, Biting the Sun reaches a rare level of literary excellence for the genre.  Still, there are moments of pure recognition as the characters have their foibles and stumbles.  In all, I loved reading it and could recommend it to anybody who might have the fortitude to witness the casual tragedy of this peculiar dystopian world.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2003-12-13

Mankind is on the verge of a Martian terraforming project a few hundred years from the present day.  In a state-of-the-art satellite station Gotham (orbiting Earth) scientists prepare and research while special teams are regularly dispatched to Mars to establish the framework for a permanent colony.  A Gotham-employed sleep researcher, Dr. Reston is plagued by a series of increasingly bizarre nightmares that give him uncomfortable premonitions about something sinister pending on Mars.<BR>As a non-scientist, I was still able to appreciate with fascination what seems to be a very credible and realistic account of the future world in this universe.  The logistics of a working space station and how humans adapt to it, the early stages of a terraforming project -- these are explained well enough to create a plausible backdrop for the story, but not detailed to death for more casual audiences like me.  The looming mystery on Mars that culminates with a first encounter with an ancient Martian race is the real story as far as I'm concerned.  The focus of Dream Thief is nicely character-driven.<BR>Stephen Lawhead does a surprising departure from space about midway and takes us to an even more alien environment (for most of us Westerners):  India.  Seen through the eyes of a santized, educated man of the 23rd (?) Century, India is even more exotic and disturbing.  Lawhead may be borrowing from some pretty standard SF mythos at this point in the novel as he ties in space visitors with certain aspects of humanity's religious and cultural heritage (Gee, where have I heard that before..?), but his interpretation of how that worked out from the aliens' standpoint is unique.  He deserves credit for an original twist on that modern day Science Fiction convention.<BR>Readers of Lawhead's Arthurian and fantasy series books will be very happy with his change to Sci Fi. His style is intact.  New readers will just enjoy the good tale.  And as in his other books, the Christian message isvery subtle (ie, not &quot;preachy&quot;).  In fact, the implications of the spiritual revelations from the Martian could just as easily be New Age as Christian, as no mention of Jesus is actually made (and believe me, I was watching for it).  Whether or not that is a plus is up for you to decide, but I was a tad disappointed in Stephen for that.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2003-12-06

Since the illustrations (which are fabulous, by the way) appear to be done in the very same style as the television cartoon, I suspect they may be stills from an actual episode.  If that's the case, the writers have done a remarkable job of translating it into a kid's picture book.<br /> Little Bill himself is a kid who lives downtown with his family and his pet hamster, Elephant.  One day, while LB is distracted, Elephant wanders off in his bedroom before he could be put back in his ball.   Poor LB thinks his friend has run away from home.  He and his whole family search the house, in both likely and unlikely places, until Bill's older brother comes up with a plan to lure Elephant back that just might work.<BR>The story has a nice, unhurried pacing and sequence that little ones will have fun following as the family explores the house in their search.  I like that it subtly encourages children to engage their problem solving skills and search each page for where the hamster is hiding.  There is also an underlying message of the importance of compassion and helping.  Like the several episodes that I have watched on tv with my two kids, this story is great material for preschoolers that they have no trouble identifying with.<BR>-A, aka merribelle	2003-11-14

It didn't help that the first page illustrates an elephant passing gas with KABOOM!  But later on, I realized that this was the way author Shinta Cho intended to desensitize readers to what is a very taboo subject in polite society.<br />With a frank and straightforward style, The Gas We Pass explains in layman's terms the reason our bodies produce gas, how we expel it and why this is a healthy, natural thing.  A variety of people and animals are helpfully illustrated eating and farting.  There is no sense of shame or mockery in the subtext, which helps children to avoid associating gas with jokes or rudeness.  <br />The drawings are a bit amateurish and simple, but they complement the text nicely.  In all, not an exciting read, but it does explain this bodily function well for children.  To this day my now five year old boy never tells fart jokes.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2003-11-14

I don't think there's one Dr. Seuss book that I can't recall being read to me when I was  somewhere in the under-10 age.  Mr. Brown Can Moo, Can You? stands out in particular.  How could a child forget the first time mom makes those delightful noises to go with the pictures in a book?  It's the stuff of high comedy and intense interest to three-year-olds everywhere.<br />Mr. Brown is a funny little man dressed to the nines (in dapper brown of course) who can imitate all sorts of noises like a wiz.  You'd better be prepared to go beyond barnyard animal sounds, too - lightening cracks, goldfish kisses, and a hippo chewing gum (which is GRUM GRUM, for those of you who don't know!). The book prompts children to try and match Mr. Brown's sounds in a nice, low-pressure way.<br /> I'm not sure if this book has ever received official recognition for its educational value to young children, but as far as I'm concerned MBCMCY is a wonderful tool for teaching kids to be better observers, listeners, and responders to their surroundings.  Better yet, it introduces parents to the fine art of interactive reading.<br />-(...)	2003-11-10

Looking through this book brought back many nostalgic memories - and many of them had nothing to do with the pictures per se.  Sure, the Home Ec class films made in the 50s and 60s could've been the Technicolor prototypes to the photographs of Cabbage Swirl Pie and Hot Dogs in Aspic; all delectable combinations of avocado green, saturated lumps of red, appetizingly congealed like the Blob in the centers of pink plates and yellow formica tabletops.  The best part, though, was reading the acerbic sidebar comments made by the author.  It was a keen flashback to the days when my sister and I would sit making wisecracks about the pictures in pretentious books, or supply alternate dialog to bad cinema.  Outrageous fun!<br />The author explains that he was first inspired to share with the world the joys of cookbook photos of decades past when he rediscovered a cookbook his mother had kept hidden away somewhere for many years (because she, thankfully, never actually used it on her grateful family).  Feeling a sense of duty to explore the folly of our ancestors, he then went on a search for the pictorial formulas of all things ghastly and retro.  The result is the Gallery of Regrettable Foods, a cautionary tale lest we, too, go that unfortunate route.  The names of the chapters alone will clue you in:  Submit to the Dominion of Ketchup; Cooking with 7up; the World of Molds;  and so on... best you pop an antacid tablet before you look.<br />I felt that the book was compiled in a spirit of morbid fascination, softened by a somewhat affectionate regard for our silly cultural past.  If you look at it as a humorous study of how our tastes and fashions have shaped food over time, you can really enjoy looking through this book.  It would certainly make a great coffee table conversation starter.  <br />Just save the anchovy balls for your cats.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2003-10-05

At the same time, without even realizing it, I was learning about what it meant to be a pioneer girl in the mid-1800s, back when the American Wild West was largely unsettled and still justified the Wild part.  It was a lot less like the cowboy movies than Id imagined.<br />The American Girl stories must have been created with girls like me in mind.  If you are unfamiliar with these books, they are the stories of fictional girls from various eras of American history and geography, each telling a small part of the story of the peoples that made up the character of our nation in the 1700s, 1800s and the first half of the 1900s.  Kirstens Story Collection is a collection of stories written about Kirsten Larson, a Swedish girl who came over to America with her family in 1854 to be pioneers.  Although Kirsten is a fictional person, she is apparently based on a composite of real pioneers of her time and seems very well-researched. Through her eyes we see New York, the Mississippi River on a great riverboat, the Midwest through a pioneer caravan and several small towns along the way.  Kirsten meets and befriends other pioneers, farmers and native Americans.  She endures hardships with her familiy and struggles to learn English at the Powderkeg School.  Always, Kirsten solves her problems with the support of her family and faith in hard work and integrity (those things we call American values).<br />As an adult I read these stories quickly.  They are written in a straightforward style suited perfectly for their intended age group of 7+.  The themes of family, friendship and adventures are universally appealing and fun even while subtly teaching history to young minds.  The morals are wholesome but not based on any specific faith (maybe a little too politically correct in my opinion, but not conspicuously).  If I had a daughter I would happily encourage her to read these books.  Maybe Ill keep my copy for my boys.<br />In the tradition of the Little House books, this story collection is nicely illustrated with colored pencil drawings (although by no means could you consider it a picture book  these are real novels for ages seven and up).  I enjoyed having them bound together in a quality hardcover binding as opposed to earlier editions in separate paperback versions. IMHO this would be a great gift book for a young reader, a definite keepsake.  <BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2003-09-29

Should I compare it to the classic Lord of the Rings for its impressively epic scope?  Would it be best to focus on the honest, often painful humanity of the many characters - so rare in a fantasy novel - that personalizes each point of view?  Perhaps I could impress other customers here with the sheer brilliance of a plot that weaves so many seemingly disparate stories together to form a believable alternate universe in which not only politics, intrigue, war, adventure and romance can coexist plausibly, but magic as well.  How could I do such a work justice?<br />I might as well get this part out of the way first.  Obligatory Synopsis:  in a fantasy continent that bears a familiarity to Middle Ages England, Winter is coming.  Winter in this world means a sort of mini ice age that will last for seven years before receding. In the always-frosty Northern area, the races of nonhuman beings are gathering to advance with the snows; there are hints that there is an ancient, evil power behind their forces.  At the same time in the South, political infighting for the Throne has begun. Overseas, the daughter of the dispossessed former King is maneuvering forces of her own for a bid for the throne.  All this is told through the various stories of both \\"good guys\\" and not-so-good guys.<br />For starters, AGOT can't be accurately compared to any other book or series in the Fantasy genre (not without insulting it).  The nearest thing of its type is the laborious Wheel of Time series by Jordan - see what I mean? And yet this first in the Song of Ice and Fire series is fathoms above that aimless, droning style.  Martin has perfected what Jordan had arguably introduced; the multiple characters' points of view telling the vast saga on an intimate, up-close scale.  Never did I feel that I was being strung along, but rather lead by increments toward an incredible revelation somewhere up ahead.  Martin builds the suspense masterfully in each book.<br />But by far the most striking thing about the Song of Ice and Fire is the \\"rules\\" that the author breaks.  Martin is not afraid to tell the tale from the point of view of some very unlikable, even immoral characters.  He is bold about revealing facts from a character's past that challenge one's impressions and assumptions about their ethics.  He does not lay all his cards on the table up front, but rather unexpectedly reveals details that later change the whole picture and twist the plot admirably.  And his most unusual move: this author even allows \\"favorites\\" to die occasionally (no names here...)!  These risks pay off well to serve the story as a whole, bring a sense of true humanity to the people of this world and drive the reader on to the next series installment.<br />It's just too bad that I can't magically transplant my sense of admiration for AGOT onto this page.  Hopefully, you are intrigued enough to give it a try; it would be a shame to miss what IMHO could be the best series of the decade.<br />-Andrea, aka Merribelles toward an incredible revelation somewhere up ahead.

Here, the reader is gently encouraged to take stock of their photos, plan pages and journal with an eye toward one's ultimate purpose - brag book, heritage, wedding, travel, etc?  All aspects of the art of using photos and journaling, design and color, accents and gimmicks are explored as a means to tell whatever story you are trying to tell through your album.  The author never assumes that you already know about a technique, page style or trick:  there's even a major section dedicated to a glossary of common scrapbooking terms.   An entire section is devoted to taking better pictures.  If I were an absolute beginner to scrapbooking, this book would be a lifesaver in many ways.  <br />I had to subtract one star because four years after the first printing, Scrapbook Storytelling is starting to look a bit dated. For instance, Joanna Campbell Slan lists stickers, die cuts and odd bits of memorabilia as the main accents and page decorations to consider in a layout.   Since 1999 there have been an explosion of products and new techniques that came too late to make it into this book (for example, quilling, chalking, tags, eyelets...I could go on and on).  Then, too, new styles and looks for the patterned papers and colors are currently replacing the ones used by the author.  For those scrappaholics who purchase scrapping books to get ideas for their layouts, these will already seem very passé.<br />The other reason I subtracted a star is the glaring lack of information on computer-related techniques, equipment and software.  Digital cameras are not even mentioned.  Although many scrapbookers get by just fine without ever going near a computer, photo editing programs, computer fonts, home photo printing and even whole page layout software are increasingly important to the scrapbooker and should have more focus in a book like this.  I hope there's an updated version in the works, because a good low-pressure, basic scrapbooking guide like this is invaluable to newbies.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2003-07-01

What made you take those photographs in the first place?  Why do you spend so many hours preserving them?  Just what are you trying to express?<br />At some point, you must have decided who your \\"audience\\" would be - guests in your home, for whom you write cute and clever quips as captions to your photos?  You could create albums just for entertainment. A dry historical record of the names, dates and events you are preserving? Well at least you are helping the family genealogist at some future date.  Or something deeper...perhaps a heritage for your descendants someday, in which you express your personal life's story?<br />The Photo Scribe will teach you to do just that; to examine and organize your memories, building a file of \\"lifestory\\" experiences until you can journal the real stories behind your photographs.  It is a process that you can't rush through quickly, which may be offputting at first to some who (like me) are used to speed scrapping or scrapping with the intent to display photos first and journal as an afterthought.  You will learn that even those precious pictures are really just secondary players to the memories you are expressing in your journaling.  Think of the lifestory you are writing as the cake and the photos as icing - mere illustrations.  You could even journal and scrap a few pages of lifestory without photos at all, where necessary.<br />I will admit to having some problems with these concepts when I started reading The Photo Scribe.  The implication that I had breezed through my journaling impatiently and missed the entire point of scrapbooking was a bit depressing.  For example, I had never examined my underlying goals for my albums when I started them.  If I had, I might have realized that \\"Jake and Eric, July 2002.  My Watermelon Patch Kids!\\"  didn't go far enough in conveying the kind of thoughts and emotions I had while taking that photo of my children among the melon vines.  The real memory I wanted to preserve was in how preciousand fleeting these early years are and the pure enjoyment of playing in the dirt and sunlight with ladybugs and butterflies alighting on our hair.  After my older child had recovered from a serious viral illness just two months earlier, the vignette of them playing together robust and happy that afternoon was what had really inspired me to grab the camera in the first place.  If I had planned my page to focus on that, rather than a fun quip, it would have been quite different, not to mention more meaningful to me and to my children. <br />Take heart, you don't have to redo all your old pages.  There are ways to incorporate new journaling into existing areas, as the author explains later on.  You can even create alternate albums to amuse and delight the casual onlooker and reserve the lifestory albums for your intimate circle of family and friends.  The most important thing is that you are creating albums that satisfy not only your need to show off pictures, but the deeper need to share your thoughts and memories.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle.	2003-06-15

Books	5	53	54	N	Y	Best variety of draw-it-yourself alphabets for scrapbookers	This book is relatively new on the scrapbooking scene, but already I find myself pulling it off the shelf frequently.  It is great to be able to create my own titles in the ideal lettering styles, sizes and colors for each page, rather than having to rely on letter stickers and die cuts.<br />Scrapbook Lettering starts with a short, helpful introduction that runs through basic tools and techniques, then illustrates the process of freehand lettering.  The main body however is devoted to the 50 alphabets.  Each font has a two-page spread devoted to it that features its use in sample layouts.  The authors are very thorough about explaining the simple techniques you will use to draw each alphabet yourself.  Suggested theme pages that go particularly well with the alphabet are included, along with variation ideas & tips.   I love the last ten alphabets, which are organized chronologically according to which decade they best complement  great for those heritage pages!<br />Heres what I discovered after practicing with other creative lettering books:  the font styles that can be fleshed out from a basic outline alphabet tend to have a fun, casual feeling to them, but quickly run out of designs for more formal titles and pages.  The impressive thing about Scrapbook Lettering on the other hand is that the alphabets are designed by about 20 different published lettering artists, so there is enough style variety that you can match a font to suit any page from wedding albums to baby books.  You can draw more than half of them completely freehand; with the rest you will need some help from photocopiers, grids or some tracing paper in order to accurately transfer the lines and maintain the precise look of the fancier fonts.  <br />Some scrapbookers, who are used to completely freehanding the more casual styles of other lettering books, may feel that this is too much trouble to go to for a page title.  My advice would be not to give up so easily on your artistic instincts! I think that if you find a more technically involved alphabet that you think would put the perfect finishing touch on your memory page, you should invest the little extra effort it will take to transfer it with grid paper or enlarge with a photocopier first.  It will be worth it.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2003-06-10

Lo and behold, a new world of health and physically based well-being opened to me as I began to understand just how my nutritional habits (and lack thereof) were undermining the quality of my life.<br />A common myth about Dr. Atkins that could stand some clearing up is that he advocates a strict homeopathic system of medical care and an unbalanced meat-only diet.  These misconceptions can be corrected by reading the first few chapters.  Atkins actually gives well-reasoned explanations of his philosophy of Complementary medicine, an approach that stresses prevention via good dietary habits, vitamin supplements and exercise, then homeopathic and vitamin remedies when there is a problem, and finally traditional medicine when all else fails (Yeah, he's a quack all right!).  Without going into the details and logistics here, I was impressed with how logical and simple to apply this system is.<br />Where Atkins' detractors have hung up on most is the section on diet and how our last 150 years or so of history have affected it.  From our pre-industrial food options though the Twentieth Century's sudden proliferation of processed flour and sugar, we can trace the steady rise of heart disease, obesity, tooth decay and Type 2 diabetes.  Worse, the industries that stood to profit from the \\"deadly duo\\" (and other starchy carb-based foods that were taking the place of meats, eggs, butter and cheese as the bulk of our diets) greatly influenced the medical profession's research and findings.  The resulting decline of our national health is a bitter legacy to take responsibility for, and that is just what too many of our processed food makers, doctors, pharmaceutical companies and health experts would have to do once they conceded that Atkins may indeed have been right.  For that reason, such an admission may be decades in coming. <br />Whether or not you find yourself agreeing with that area of Atkins' theory, the book presents sound arguments and encourages a lifestyle that has improved untold lives over the past 30 years.  There are changes you can make that will lower your blood pressure, bad cholesterol and triglycerides, eliminate systemic yeast infections, reverse diabetes and re-energize you - all without the use of drugs.  In fact, you will probably end up being able to ditch the drugs you are on now. <br />I believe that someday Dr. Atkins vitamin and diet principles will be the standard recommendations from the health industry.  It is hard to argue with the steadily growing segment of our population that simply gets lasting results by using them, and expands slowly via word of mouth.  Meanwhile, those happy few of us will continue to benefit from the work done by this incredible man and his steadfast campaigning on our behalf before a tragic head wound took his life a few months ago.<BR>Rest in peace, Doctor.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle.	2003-06-08

If you've started the Atkins diet, or at least read the diet book, then you already realize the importance of counting the carbohydrate grams you consume.  Please allow me to clear up some FAQ's:<br />1.  This book will not teach you how to do the Atkins diet - for that, read Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution.  <br />2.  This book will show you total carbohydrate, fat, and protein gram counts for standard portion sizes of general or common foods.  For instance, there is a general listing for \\"fig\\" but not \\"Kadota fig\\" or \\"Mission\\".   If you are into more exotic fare than the standard American foods listed - say for instance that you like obscure asian fruits like or you're a oeniphile who is interested in the carb count of 60 different varieties of French wine- then you will have to do research for the carbs in your special interest on your own.<br />3.  This book will not make specific recommendations as to which ones to avoid, eat more of, etc. - that's not its job.  Instead, you are allowed to make those decisions for yourself based on the information presented and your individual allowance of daily carbs.<br />4.  This book does not list calories because the Atkins diet is qualitative, not quantitative.<br />5.  This book will, however, be a quick on-the-spot reference guide for Atkins dieters.  It is designed to be portable and easy to understand at a glance when you need information in a hurry.  <br />Are there any flaws?  Yes.  For one thing, IMHO, the price could come down a bit considering that this book is a very small, almost the size of those supermarket pocket books at the checkout counter that cost only 99 cents or so.  Also, it would have been helpful if Dr. Atkins had included the fiber content along with the fats, carbs and protein so that one could calculate total impact carb grams and make more educated decisions.  Still, I believe this is the best carb gram counter out there for low-carb dieting purposes.  I find myself consulting it quite often.	2003-06-02

This has resulted in a bit of fraying on the edges of the pages and a binding that has started falling apart.  But I have no regrets that my kids have returned to this book often and with anticipation when I announce that it is story time.<br />In this Mother Goose collection, you will find all the favorite rhymes in their original form; beautiful, sentimental, at times seemingly savage to our 21st century sensibilities - they were all written without regard to political correctness. For instance, the little old woman who lived in a shoe actually whipped all her children soundly before sending them to bed (not \\"kissed\\"), and Jack and Jill really do \\"break their crowns\\" instead of their hats or just bumping their heads.  A few other selections mention the deaths of children and animals.  Parents will have to prepare to explain some serious things to children after reading some of these rhymes.<br />The language back then was apparently more sophisticated than modern versions:  consider  \\"The Cat and the Fiddle\\" in which the little dog laughed to see such craft, which rhymes rather better than the later versions' (dumbed down) sport or play.   In my opinion, that only adds to their color and charm.   Hey, you can use it as an educational opportunity to teach new word usages to your kids. <br /> But the real reason to choose this rhyme book is that the Volland Edition of Mother Goose is illustrated with an eye to beauty that you simply won't find in modern nursery rhyme books.  That is what really sets the Volland Edition apart from all the modern collections; magical, perfect watercolors for each rhyme. No picture book since the Volland Edition has matched the quality here and I do believe that children enjoy good artwork and benefit from it greatly.  In my case, this very book was inspirational in setting a high standard for my aspirations to become an artist someday.<br />As a great way to teach children poems and rhymes that will stay with them their whole lives, or as a valued heritage from another century, the Volland Mother Goose is one book every family should experience IMHO.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2003-05-25

Otherwise, I would have passed it over in favor of a book on \\"heartwarming expressions\\" made specifically for scrapbookers, as that was my purpose for hunting up quotable material.<br /> I didn't expect the range of authors quoted here to be as wide and as richly reperesentative as it is.  There are contemporary writers, classic authors, ancient proverbs from all over the world, religious sayings, and truisms from historical figures and current celebrities (although very little from the Bible, which surprised me).  The topics these quotes cover are also varied on aspects of life.  Take a look at the table of contents:<BR>Within Ourselves<BR>People Together<BR>Our Better Side<BR>For Better or Worse<BR>When We Act<BR>The Art of Conversation<BR>Civilization's Gift<BR>The Nature of Life<BR>The Natural World<BR>The World of Nations<BR>Despite being brief and, ahem, digestible, this book manages to touch upon ideas and beliefs examined from several angles, some of them droll and humorous.  In any event, a deliberate reading of Quotable Quotes will provide food for thought and could spark quite a few conversations in your household.  Come to think of it, this book of quotes is almost like a short course in world philosophy!  <br />I'm glad that I went for a more general-purpose book of quotes now, as it will have myriad uses aside from being a great source for my scrapbook pages.  <BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle.	2003-04-30

All that , and it's cute, too!<BR>It turns out that Becky Higgins' style of creative lettering is based on a simple alphabet that is adorned in one of six basic ways, then embellished and colored in.  Yes, it really is that easy!  Your titles and first paragraph letters can be customized according to season, color scheme, occasion, pattern match, mood, etc.  The fifty variations on the six lettering styles will be more than enough for most people to fill their scrapbooks without seeming repetitive - but you may find yourself designing variations of your own after practicing for a while.<br />The limitation of The Art of Creative Lettering is that IMHO, the lettering styles lend themselves almost exclusively to a country and/or casual feel in the page designs.  This is a popular way to scrapbook, and you may not need anything else.  However, sometimes a more sophisticated, adult look is called for.  And if like me you have a formal wedding and a heritage album to complete, you may end up turning to sticker letters or laser cut titles to get the traditional look you want.  <br />I would highly recommend this book for anybody who believes s/he\\"can't\\" letter nicely.<BR> -Andrea, aka merribelle	2003-04-24

As it turns out, the frugal way is also the organic way, generally.<br />TFG is organized to guide you through long-range strategies that will save you money in both short-term and long-term investments.  An early chapter deals with the bare bones tools that you will need to start with; how to spot quality that will last, how to maintain them, and different uses for each.  Next we learn how to plan a garden based on regional climates, making heavy use of naturalizing perennials and native plants that need less maintenance, watering and/or care (and so fewer products to buy).  If you like the quick gratification of annuals, there are quite a few tips here that will help you maximize their impact in your garden.  A great emphasis is placed on soil health, how to get it and how to increase it, thus saving more money  that would have had to be wasted on  expensive fertilizers and replacement plants.  Then there are the recipes for homemade bug sprays and remedies that can be concocted from common household items.<br />TFG explained gardening organically in a way that made it easy and sensible even for me when I was first trying to make compost and wean away from chemical sprays.  There is a lot that can be done to fortify and protect your plants and trees that will benefit them and the environment, and  surprise!  It's cheaper than chemical solutions.  My garden has been thriving ever since.<br />Frugal gardeners, don't be afraid to spend the money on this book!

In The Complete Guide to Creating Heritage Scrapbooks, we are encouraged to tackle that most intimidating of scrapping tasks, the Family Heritage Album.<br />The CGTCHS launches with an explanation of the importance of preserving our family's historical photos, stories, and memorabilia in an archival safe environment (aka, the scrapbook album).  A short introduction to basic scrapbooking tools and techniques takes up a few pages.  The main body of the book which follows is divided into six sections:  <BR>Daily Life (documenting/preserving those \\"slice of life\\" moments in time);<BR>Celebrations (weddings, graduations, holidays, religious events, etc.);<BR>Wartime;<BR>Across the Generations (comparing people then and now);<BR>and Portraits and Family Trees.<BR>Each section is a collection of examples of pages dealing with these themes, and instructions on the process to recreate the page ideas presented.  I found them to be very appealing, tasteful and well done overall.  To help supplement one's journaling, there are nice year-by-year historical trivia timelines printed on the marginal sidebars thoughout the sections, dating from 1850 to 1975.   Several of these ideas will end up in my own albums.<br />However, a \\"complete\\" guide it is not.  CGTCHS provides minimal information regarding researching family geneology, organizing one's search for information and a bare two page spread dedicated to the primary task of duplicating and restoring ancient photographs.  I would expect these to be the first steps in researching a family history, but commentary on these subjects is scattered randomly.   Also, to my way of thinking it was illogical to put \\"Portraits and Family Trees\\" last, as a family tree would be useful for keeping one's information correct as one completes other parts of the album.  Readers who intend to put a serious effort into this aspect of their scrapbooking project will need to look elsewhere.<br />Other things I would have found helpful would have been a guide to era-appropriate color schemes and decorating themes, and more on interviewing relatives regarding their own personal histories.<br />Despite these drawbacks, CGTCHS was a great resource for ideas and inspiration.  I finished the book with fresh encouragement to start on my own family heritage album.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle.	2003-04-17

The book is grounded on the idea that gardening should be shared with kids at a young age, the better to nurture a lifetime of healthy pleasure and respect for nature: therefore, learning how to grow things should be a fun experience, without a lot of restrictions, rules and long waiting to see results.  Every project is scaled for children -- with a little help from parents - to be quick, do-able and fun.<br />Parents will appreciate that the theme gardens in RSB&B will not send them running to the local garden center to charge up a small fortune in tools and materials.  In keeping with organic horticultural practices, the author explains simple, homemade composting techniques and recipes to build soil and feed plants.  Whenever possible, readers are encouraged to use found objects around the house and garage for cultivating and planting:  she gives \\"permission\\" to dig and work the soil with spoons and forks, pot up potatoes in colanders and herb gardens in old gardening boots, and find new purpose for rusty old wagons as movable feasts of annual flowers.  <br />Kids can't help but learn quite a bit from their experiences in sowing and growing. The author opens up a world of wonderment that tantalizes kids to learn from the changes and growth taking place.  She subtly encourages kids to watch for all the insect and animal life their gardens will attract.  RSB&B is densely packed with fun factoids like, \\"Run your fingers over the pumpkin vines.  Farmers use them to protect the plots of other crops\\" and \\"If you like the taste of licorice, you won't be able to pass your fennel without nibbling.  Fennel is called the weight-watcher's herb because it satisfies an appetite.\\"  <br />Designed with humor and illustrated with charm, RSB&B will prompt people of all ages to rediscover why they love playing outside in the sun, fresh air and dirt.	2003-04-09

This is the book for anybody who has ever bitten into a store-bought tomato and wondered whatever happened to rich, juicy flavor.  Three years ago I was asking myself that same question when I stumbled across Dr. Carolyn Male's 100 HEIRLOOM TOMATOES FOR THE AMERICAN GARDEN.  <br />Written by an avid Seed Savers' Exchange member after she had grown more than 1,000 heirloom varieties of tomato, this book is an introduction to open-pollinated (as opposed to the unjustly popular hybridized) tomatoes for home gardeners.  Dr. Male manages to discuss the historical and present significance of cultivating these heirlooms in a rational voice while yet relaying her passion for the flavorful heritage they represent to her.  The field guide has full-page photographs of each kind with notes on their colorful origins, flavor types and everything else you could want to know about these personal treasures.  Soon you will find yourself caught up in the mania to seek out the assortment of seeds that will yield tomatoes with character, lore and unbeatable taste.<br />Although it has a truncated field guide format and flexible cover, 100 HEIRLOOM TOMATOES also serves as an excellent primer for general tomato culture.  In the first 42 pates you will learn about selecting the right heirloom for your purposes, germinating and transplanting, common diseases and conditions, saving your own seeds, etc.  Dr. Male looks at various standard schools of thought thoughout this section while presenting good arguments for her own  practices. <br />I found this book to be one of the more honest examinations of tomato varieties, from Dr. Male's frank mention of both pros and cons down to the photos, which displayed typical physiological flaws alongside more perfect examples of the fruit and foliage.   After growing and sampling for myself several of the tomatoes recommended here, I can testify that the descriptions are spot-on while leaving some room for differing climatic and cultural conditions.  Dr. Male's degree in microbiology and her regular gardening magazine article contributions further reinforce her as a noted authority in this field.  This is a guide that the home gardener can have confidence in. <br />Recommended for any home vegetable gardener and not a few specialty market gardeners besides.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle.	2003-04-07

Jane Dyer's illustrations have just that perfect, whimsical charm that makes such children's books unforgettable.  Unfortunately, this is a cookbook that seemed to forget that its main objective is to provide a collection of soup recipes that the whole family will love.<br />The introduction hinted at such promising soups that were fun and simple to make that I really wanted to like BMS.  In fact, the recipes did turned out to be simple; averaging about 11 ingredients each, including spices, and involving nothing more complicated than chopping vegetables, herbs etc. and throwing everything into a pot to simmer.  Occasionally, you have to put something or another into a blender and puree. So far so good.  The names and concepts of soup were even fun; Hot Diggity Dog soup (hot dogs), Polka Dot Soup (black beans), Abracadabra (Greek lemon-and-egg), Peter Peter Pumpkin Eater (obvious), and Believe It Or Not Soup (Ice Cream), to name a few examples.   I will even go so far as to say that these soups generally are fresh, healthy alternatives to the canned varieties as they contain much less sodium and fat and are made from scratch.  With all the chopping required I would limit kids' participation to just standing by and \\"helping\\" mom and dad by throwing ingredients into the pot, then stirring, but that could also be fun with a little imagination. <br />Where BMS lost me was in the flavor.  Every recipe I tried needed heavy doctoring to attain a flavor discernable enough to justify going to the bother of making these soups from scratch.  Possibly, too, I am used to commercial soups that are thick and hearty, leaving the BMS soups seeming runny and diluted by comparison.  The chili recipe, claiming to be AbsolutelyThe Best, was even erroneous in its recommended cooking times by a few hours (dried kidney beans are NOT fit to eat after only being soaked overnight and cooked for a mere 30 minutes).  The You Can't Elope soup was a simple mixture of pureed melons, half-and-half, juice, wine and vanilla that proved to be so bland that I found myself wishing I had simply eaten the sun-ripened melon in the first place.  And do we really need a \\"recipe\\" for what every kid achieves instinctively anyway by mashing ice cream in the bowl until it's creamy and half-melted?<br />The lone standout recipe among the seven that I sampled in this book was the pumpkin soup, which was a welcome change of pace for pumpkin purees and nicely smooth, neither watery nor artificially thick.  Even the spices were right on target.  <br />I imagine that I will eventually try some others in this book, and so perhaps keep it on my shelf for awhile longer.  IMHO, Blue Moon Soup is a nice choice for people avidly watching their salt intake who love homemade soups. <BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2003-03-31
US	50986119	RDNXWX8E8PWL3	0789452375	482253462	DK Guide to Dinosaurs	Books	5	13	13	N	N	Informative, visually stylish Dinosaur picture book for kids	I bought this for my three year old boy last year hoping he would grow into it.  As predicted, at first he only paid attention to the impressive photos of the dinosaurs that dominated each two-page section:  but a year later, he is drawn to examine the smaller pictures and ask more questions about the animals.  This book works so well, I think, because it can appeal to a wide age range of children and has something of interest in it appropriate to every stage of learning.<br />The best educational point about this book IMHO is that the dinosaurs featured are not the familiar ones we see in all the other dinosaur picture books (T rex, Brontosaurus, Triceratops, etc), but the author chooses to focus on less-known types such as Barosaurus, Gigantosaurus, Gastonia and Coelophysis, to name a few.  Broader subjects include social behaviors, environmental factors that influenced body types and hide patterns/colors, and speculation on possible fates of the dinosaurs. Supplemented with a more traditional dinosaur picture book, your child will eventually have an uncommon knowledge on dinosaurs.<br />DK Guide to Dinosaurs is also one of the more well-illustrated dinosaur picture books for kids in their grade school years.  (Actually, the main \\"illustrations\\" are photographs of quality museum models in realistic diorama environments). The unusual  design layouts are grounded on black rather than the traditional white, lending a sophisticated look to a subject that is all too often overly textbook-ish in other natural history picture books of this type.  More importantly however, the sidebars, timelines and graphical inserts are packed with information and placed in a way that flows well with the main page, leading the eye to points of interest along the page and teaching kids in a more subtle style.  <br />This would be a very good choice for children starting grade school and I can foresee many years when it will be used as a reference for reports and other school projects. Myonly criticism is that the binding will not take continual abuse from the smaller children in the family, so keep it on a higher shelf...	2003-03-27
US	50986119	R2UMG3CCBFLW5L	0374177023	90301407	Instances of the Number 3: A Novel	Books	4	13	13	N	Y	Portrait of an affair with a touch of the mystical	From the first page of INSTANCES OF THE NUMBER THREE I was struck by how unexpected the characters were.  Here we have a man's funeral attended by his widow (Bridget), his family, his close friends...and his mistress (Frances), whom nobody knew existed until the day before.  Yet rather than the melodramatic scene one would expect to ensue, all parties involved actually behave cordially, even to the point of absurdity.  Further, there is a marked lack of emotional reaction of any kind from the widow, including grief.  Is this Surrealism, I wondered, or just very British mannerisms?<br />What became apparent as I delved further into this mysterious novel was that the author uses the memories and flashbacks of her characters to gradually build a complete picture of the scenario.  We are privy to behind-the-scenes thoughts of all three participants in the love triangle, even Peter's (the deceased husband); yet the narrative voice takes on the quality of an objective observer who is piecing together the events and forces that shaped these people's lives.  Well before I looked at the author's biography I had the feeling of listening in on a series of therapy sessions and, surprise!  ...the author is in fact a psychologist.<br />Frances, Peter and other side characters start by showing self-centeredness and shortsighted thinking.  This novel could be said to be about how they each embarked on a journey after Peter's death to examine themselves and grow spiritually.  On a larger scale, I think the author uses their personal stories to underscore the connection that religion, environment, and maturity have to our lives and what kind of people we become.<BR> <BR>I believe the strong point of IOTNT is in Bridget herself.  As unusual in a contemporary novel as it is to feature a woman in late middle age, it is even more commendable that she is able to separate her personal hurts from what she knows to be the moral, compassionate way to live.  Bridget is able to open her arms toan inconvenient,  homeless teenager and take him in simply because her late husband knew him and would have wished it. We see her welcome Frances, if not warmly at first, then at least civilly.  Later, she includes Frances in some areas of her life and even maintains a tenuous friendship with her despite repeatedly discovering the many small ways her husband cheated her for the sake of this other woman.  She can recognize Frances as a worthy person because Peter loved her, too, and thus is eventually able to overcome her own bitterness about the affair.  Her human wisdom is uncommon for any age.  <br />Readers may find the writing style a bit dry if they are not used to contemporary British fiction.  On the other hand, there are insights into human nature and even a touch of supernatural elements to bring this work a bit above the ordinary novel fare.  I rate IOTNT 4 stars for fresh, thoughtful character studies and a new angle on how ordinary people handle the bigger mysteries of life and death.<br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2003-03-21

There's no telling how much better my early pages would have been if I had read Creative Photo Cropping for Scrapbooks (CPCS) first.  I probably would have saved a lot of money also, for example, by learning how to display my photographs in a way that kept them interesting but didn't rely on buying a lot of decorative accents and fancy papers.  <br />After a short section in the beginning about the tools and basics of cropping photographs, the techniques shown quickly lead to more creative ideas.  Techniques covered include:  cropping frames into the photo, silhouettes, innovative ways to integrate punches into the action, shapes from templates or freehand, twenty-six ways to make letters from photos, using other photographs as mats and borders, photo mosaics and quilts, weaving, and leaded glass effects.  It should be emphasized that these are all things that do not take a lot of artistic talent or training; however, when you feel inspired to try for a certain look or two, you may find yourself changing the way you take your pictures from the start.<br />One great thing about creative photo cropping, IMHO, is that you are not rushing to the scrapbook store every time you decide to try a different technique with your pictures.  The most-used tools in your supply box will be scissors, adhesive, a xacto knife, a straightedge metal ruler and a cutting mat.  True, some of these layouts ideas call for templates.  The book provides three such templates for enlarging with a photocopier, and several cutting patterns as well.  The reader may even be inspired to try some freehand pattern drafting.  Scrapbooking with the methods in this book is very easy on the wallet.<br />Basically, I love this book.  My layouts are better and cleaner, and I am inspired by CPCS to focus on the real stars of the pages - the photos themselves. <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2003-02-19

There are plenty of great photos; there may even be notes on the dates and subjects.  But beyond that, nothing.  Eventually they close the album, having learned little about their ancestors in the early 21st Century.<BR>It was precisely this imaginary scenario that finally prompted me to seek out help for my scrapbook journaling blocks in the form of Scrapbook Journaling Made Simple.  This book addresses the importance of journaling the stories and vital information that should be a part of every page in your cherished albums.  Even more to the point, SJMS tells you how to overcome these psychological impediments that we all face at one time or another.  Among these issue are:<BR>1. Fear of making a big mistake that will ruin the whole layout<BR>2. You hate your handwriting<BR>3. Lack of information about a photograph<BR>4. Not knowing how to write \\"well\\"<BR>5. Lack of time (my personal un-favorite)<BR>SJMS guides you through all the excuses, countering them neatly in simple sections that break down the task of writing your personal stories into manageable steps. Much of the process is common sense, but you will also learn getting started, tricks to jog your memory, improving the look of your text, and more.  In the process you will discover just what a wealth of lore you have within you to express on paper.<BR>If I had one criticism about this book, it is that SJMS could feature more in-depth examples of outstanding journaling from the real-life examples.  The samples they gave tended to be all too abbreviated, IMHO.  It also would have been nice to explore the dimension that quotes and various font styles can give to a page.  <BR>This book is especially good for those of us who may be starting out new to the scrapbooking craft.  SJMS has a very simple, encouraging style that puts the emphasis on the real reason we scrapbook - our heritage to the future - without overwhelming the reader with trends and product recommendations.  Basically, it will inspire you to write again.<br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2003-02-13

You never knew your crock pot could be so handy!<br /> \\"Everybody\\" knows that slow cookers are good for pot roasts and chili con carne.  But did you know that your slow cooker could produce chocolate cake, chicken and dumplings, and rice pudding?  I didn't, either. The wonder of it is, your crock pot can make all these wonderful dishes and many more with less prep time and inconvenience than the traditional versions in most cases.  Mable Hoffman's Crockery Cookery is just what I needed to dust off my slow cooker and get started with the rest of my life.<br />Regarded  by many as The Standard for crock pot cooking, this revised and updated recipe book has all of the basic favorites and quite a few more sophisticated dishes.  To date I have only tried 13 in all, a mere fraction; and a few standouts like Flank Steak in Mushroom Wine Sauce and the Nostalgic Chicken and Herbed Dumplings, have made this purchase totally worthwhile.  I would have stopped at entrees, but no - there are also some great soups, vegetable side dishes, party appetizers and desserts.  Yes, you can bake cakes and breads in crock pots that have at least 4 and ½ quarts capacity, but be warned that they do come out on the soft  side, without that top crust.  I found the banana bread pleasant enough, however.  <br />The real surprise for me was in how perfectly suited my crock pot was  for steamed pudding recipes.  Bread pudding is a natural here.  But get ready for a heavenly Grandma's Rice Pudding - light, fluffy, just the right amount of sweetness and no more.  The best I have ever tasted, bar none.<br />I should hasten to add that Mable Hoffman puts an emphasis on preparing recipes from fresh, wholesome ingredients, and very few of them involve opening cans.  You will end up with nutritious, lower-than-average-salt dishes that will take a little more prep time than frozen dinners, but greet you with a delightful aroma when you walk in after a hard day's work.   Most of the recipes  are even thrifty when compared to a fast food diet.  I don't remember how I ever managed to cook for my family 6 days a week before I discovered this cookbook!<br />My only complaint is that I have used mine so much in the last 4 months that a few pages escaped from the softcover binding.  No problem: I am getting my copy spiral bound at a local copy center.  I intend to keep this one around for many years to come.<br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle	2003-02-12

Originating from the late 21st Century, when the use and laws of time travel are well established, Mr. Henry is nevertheless poorly prepped for the culture shock he experiences.  He must interpret a set of instructions he doesn't remember receiving in order to replace something that was taken from its timeline so that history doesn't self-destruct into chaos 60 years later...and do so while never revealing his ignorance of Stilton spoons and the correct way to refer to a pregnant cat in the presence of ladies (that would be never).  Along the way are several literary tributes and thoughtful debates on the nature of history:  character or unseen forces?  ...to say nothing of a plethora of gut-wrenching hilarity. <br />To Say Nothing of the Dog manages to draw from several literary genres without watering down its verbal potency or losing focus of the essentially sci fi plot.  And although it won a Hugo award in 1999, this book will not alienate readers who are not normally into science fiction in general (the publisher persists to this day in classifying it as general fiction).  In fact, I will have no trouble recommending To Say Nothing of the Dog to my charmingly `50's mom as well as to a trekker friend.  <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle.	2003-01-29

We get to see above and below the soil as the garden progresses throughout the season. There are all the names of the plants and creatures labelled neatly next to each, on the main page and in the margins. Best of all, the classic children's poem about the house that Jack built is modified into a catchy text for each picture that makes understanding the magic of a little garden ecosystem effortless for kids as young as three years.<br />Top notch illustrations and a unique format set this picture book apart and earned it a permanent place in my collection.

As with the gardening books by Georgeanne Brennan, everything in here is beautifully photographed, arranged in four seasonal sections to guide the reader to recipes that include ingredients available according to what time of year you are canning at the moment.  <br />The author explains first, in near-poetic text, how she came to learn and appreciate preserving seasonal harvests while she lived in Provence many years ago.  Guided by the French style of seasonal harvest, she shows us how, by using freshest available, preferably home-grown ingredients, we can make a plethora of delicious and lovely preserves to enjoy or as gifts.  <br />Indeed, the presentation of the preserves' natural beauty through glass is what inspired these unique recipes.  Far from a standard how-to canning book with basic recipes, we are presented with unusual varieties of fruit and produce, or perhaps unconventional treatments for more conventional subjects:  Nectarine mustard, Yellow tomato ketchup, quince slices in vanilla syrup, Rose hip jelly.  Try your hand at Vin d'orange, poor man's capers(using Nasturtium seeds), or sweet-and-sour radishes.  Often you will not be able to find enough of the more exotic ingredients at the local supermarket(where am I going to get a cup of nasturtium seed pods, or a pound of rose hips?), and if you do not grow them yourself, you're out of luck. You may come to understand as I did, that the author's gardening background had a lot to do with her tendency to push the envelope in her recipes.<br />If there is one problem with this book, it is that the current canning standards have since changed, and her often-recommended use of paraffin wax seals is now discouraged for long-term storage of preserves.  Still, one could easily substitute hot processing methods for wax seals in many cases.	2003-01-18

This is a great book for 2 to 6 year olds, to go beyond the usual A is for Apple and Z is for Zebra.<br />The layout of this book is one letter of the alphabet on the top of each page, both upper and lower case in the corners.  An illustration of an animal dominates the middle, while sidebar illustrations of it's prey bracket like a frame.  A few short lines of text on the bottom explain a little bit about the hunting habits of the animal.  Example:  Merganser.  \\"A hungry merganser pops to the surface.  Only fish, frogs or crayfish that hide carefully escape this diving duck.\\"<br />A Bold Carnivore was given to my son at the age of  2.  He was really more attracted to the illustrations of animals at that time, which are detailed and realistic.  A child's mind retains information amazingly well at that age, and he was able to memorize the lines in short order.  <br />We would point to the letters at the top of each page - one in upper case and one in lower - and name them as we went, then naming the animal pictured below.  This was a great way of learning letters and associating each one with a specific animal.  My 4 year old son now also knows twenty six obscure varieties of carnivores, what they eat and their habitats.<br />Andrea, aka Merribelle	2002-12-24

The real test of a reader's poetic prowess is A.A. Milne, the living room couch and a handful of kids waiting for your renderings of growling bears and timelessl human characters.<br />It takes an extraordinary book to capture children's attention on the strength of words alone.<br />It's not that there are no illustrations here, just that each poem has just one or two small, original ink drawings; delightful, but bowing appropriately to the genius of words that can hold children spellbound.  For instance, Milne takes a subject like sidewalks and transforms it into the stuff of playacting in Lines and Squares - an irresistible cadence to chant on a walk (or a lumbering gait):<br />And the masses of bears<BR>Who wait at the corners all ready to eat the sillies who tread on the lines of the street<BR>And I say to them, \\"BEARS.....<BR>Just look how I'm walking in ALL of the squares!\\"<br />As I read I can now recall the precise inflection and finger-shaking combination from Disobedience that it took to elicit giggles from my sisters and me, now working its comedy on my four-year-old son:<br />James James SAID to his mother, \\"Mother\\", he said, said he;<BR>\\"You Must Never Go Down To The End Of Town If You Don't Go Down With ME!\\"<br />When We Were Very Young is a collection of poems for children, about childhood, and for those who wish to remember its special magic view on the world.  This book is a beloved tradition in my family, starting with those cozy evenings on my Grandmother's couch as we all snuggled up to hear about the brownie that lives behind the curtain, Jonathan Jo (who had a mouth like an O), the three foxes and Christopher Robin, who couldn't stop his hoppity hop.

I have come to understand in the last few years that a third broadly generalized type of SF fan exists, who loves the military/space battle aspect of SF -- which I am also not, due to ignorance of military matters in this century.  So, you are now well-equipped to see where my point of view is coming from in my rating here. <br />On Basilisk Station is the first in the Honor Harrington series, of which I have currently read three.  Honor is a newly promoted captain, beautiful, athletic and talented,  whose first posting on the ship HMS Fearless at the disreputable Basilisk Station is a punishment for causing a high-ranking officer to lose face. The punishment is really in the impossible situation, in which the Fearless is to be responsible for singlehandedly guarding the entire system there, where there should be several such ships to do that job. In a nutshell, Honor rises to the challenge and makes the best of a bad situation by some innovative patrol scheduling.  Her deft handling of other tricky problems and unexpectedly saving the Manticoran fleet from losing a war gains her honor and respect among her crew and her far-off superiors. <br />I have heard the Honor Harrington series compared to other SF series dealing with space battles, but the reason I picked up On Basilisk Station is that Weber's books were often recommended for those who like Bujold's Vorkosigan novels.  Not likely.  The main character (Honor Harrington) is far too perfect on every level (except, naturally, that she has a negative self-image)to be believable or sympathetic, unlike Miles Vorkosigan. The author really has created a superwoman version of the typical male SF superhero, which is exactly the kind of thingthat loses me.  The battle scenes are good, the world-building is interesting and well-thought-out; but the characters are a bit stereotyped and/or unexplored.  <br />If you really like military- and hardware-oriented SF, this is just the book for you. But as a fan of character-driven fiction, I just could not muster the necessary enthusiasm, especially when my expectations were falsely raised by comparisons with some of my favorite authors.	2002-11-22

The text is placed into a gentle rhyme that takes us back to the landing at Plymouth rock, where a series of lovely paintings then depict the people's lives in their village by the harbor that first year.<br />It is obvious that the illustrator put a lot of careful attention into researching for historical accuracy.  This is a teaching technique that is particularly effective for an age group in which a picture is truly worth a thousand words.  Although  hardships and struggles are hinted at in both rhyme and painting, the real focus is on the positive relationship between the two peoples as the Indians helped the Pilgrims adapt to their new home.<br />The only caveat -- for christians and anyone who is a monotheist -- is that this book nowhere mentions God, who is after all the reason for this holiday.  It is a significant historical fact that the Pilgrims fled England due to religious persecution, and that this first Thanksgiving Feast was in Giving Thanks to God for His blessings and bounty.  Later, Abraham Lincoln officially pronounced Thanksgiving as the last Thursday in November and reaffirmed that it was a holiday specifically set aside to revere God.  So, the author's careful avoidance of this fact is a disappointment to me.<br />But if you are more on the politically correct side, you will find this book to be a perfect introduction to Thanksgiving for your children.	2002-11-20

The first thing you should know before buying this book is that this is not one of those ready-made, quick 'n' easy project books:  you will be making your boxes entirely from scratch, section by section.  Obviously a lot of work for something that you may only intend as the holder for a &quot;real&quot; present, but that is the point.  These lavish, artistically crafted containers ARE worthy gifts in themselves, and showpieces of your skills from more than one area of crafting. <BR>The author starts with lists of basic necessities for cardboard box crafting, detailing types of cardboard needed for various parts of boxes and glues, tools, etc.  Next, there is a Techniques section, with step-by-step illustrations of the various steps in boxmaking, such as batting, wrapping, assembling, and lining strips.  A similar section on ribbon embroidery techniques and other embellishments follows. These instructions are basic enough to serve as valuable references, and someone who has never attempted ribbon embroidery before can conceivably do a decent job if he/she pays careful attention.  <br />The &quot;real&quot; fun comes in the largest section, the projects lavishly photographed and laid out in two-page spreads.  These boxes are arranged from beginners skill level at the beginning, to the advanced crafter level at the end.  Each project uses new box building skills that build upon the skills practiced in the last project.  <br />I know this all sounds extremely complicated and exhausting; but I have found it to be worth it due to the fabulous results.  There are scalloped, diamond shaped, and heart-shaped boxes of various sizes at the introductory level alone.  If you decided to stop there, you would already have some beautiful victorian-inspired treasures that are totally unique from any prefabricated craft store box, many with hinged and fitted lids, lined in velvet or silky materials and padded sumptuously for a feminine feel -- and you would not have to spend more than an hour or so of total work.  But mere boxes are just a starting point.  Further along are a pincusion shelf with two drawers, a teapot, a crescent moon, a 12 inch doll's travel wardrobe case, and more.<br />If I had to nitpick some cons I could mention that it was a little inconvenient to have to spend time at the copiers enlarging the box patterns.  The only other drawback is the time you will spend shopping for just the right fabrics and notions to decorate your finished products -- which, after all, is one of those drawbacks that plagues many other crafts as well, including quilting and making clothes.  So, if you are already involved in some other area of crafting, you may have some of what you need already lying about.<br />Because of the involved and time consuming nature of this discipline, I have sadly had time to devote to learning only a few of the beginner's boxes and one more advanced project, a romantic keepsakes box with a drawstring pouch for a top instead of a lid.  This particular box has been variously enlarged and reduced to fit the size of intended birthday, shower and Christmas gifts, changing color schemes and notions to reflect the occasion.  It has become a favorite of mine and the recipients often treasure these containers long after they have eaten the chocolates or dried fruit that was inside.  So I believe that if you only find one favorite as I have, it will become like a special signature gift that you will learn to make quickly as you practice it.<br />In a nutshell, this is a great book for those who wish to put time and care into something original and beautiful that will be used as gifts and keepsakes.	2002-11-18

I put off writing this review for two years because Mirror Dance is just that caliber of excellence that I was afraid to even try to do it justice.  I wish I could get away with simply gushing and raving. This masterpiece, however, deserves much more than a \\"This book rocks!  Run, don't walk!\\" and the other usual cliche's.<br />Once again, instead of a play-by-play plot synopsis I will direct the reader's attention to the true merits of Mirror Dance (not that the plot is lacking in any way, trust me!).   First, this is a poignant look into the minds and souls of two men who happen to be genetically identitical, but whose lives have taken jarringly disparate paths. Many have wondered before if Bujold has a degree in Psychology or some other such head-shrinking, she does such a superb and realistic job of getting inside characters' heads.  But far from a tour of Psych and Neuroses 101, Mirror Dance participates;  we are speared with their hopes and heartaches, dragged into their whirlwind view of the action around them.  The moment of truth came for me when I realized that I could actually empathize with a man who was raised by terrorists to become a sociopath, and his painful struggle to rise above his upbringing to be psychologically reborn as a human.  <br />Next, Bujold accomplishes here a rare coup:  this is a carefully thought out universe, with laws, advanced technologies, cultures, wars, and moral dilemmas aplenty -- but without overwhelming attention to the logistics and alienness of this future.  We can exist with the characters here on their comfortable level of existence and marvel and puzzle just as reaslistically as they without distraction from things that would not appear out of ordinary to them; after all, do we spend time describing mundane things in our minds such as the microwave (which for instance would have seemed fantastic in a novel written 100 years ago, about us here and now)?  As Bujold put it in a commentary somewhere else, the technologyis always present, just not intrusive. <br />But best of all, this is space opera at it's pinnacle.  Good v. Evil, action, moral dilemmas, all that and Bujold's signature intelligence and wit.  Here come the cliche's I just couldn't avoid:  roller coaster ride of emotions, makes you laugh and cry, new paradigm for excellence, something for everyone, etc.  <br />What can I say, my words really are inadequate!	2002-11-15

Turns out Miri is a tough former Merc with a past that is coming after her big time in the form of the Juntavas -- a galactic mafia. Now Val Con and Miri are on the run together from varioius annoyed parties, having each made enemies of their own for all the right reasons, and they must learn to trust each other to survive. Along the way they enlist the help of some turtle-like aliens, who as chance would have it had adopted Val Con as a sort of blood brother and now take up his and Miri's cause as their own.<br />I found this installment of the Liaden Universe novels very different in tone and characterization from the first, Conflict of Honors; it also has some of the most original elements in space opera. For starters, the aliens have the feel of much-beloved relatives as opposed to weird creatures. And rather than focusing on hardware and technology (which is definitely a factor here, make no mistake) the authors engage us with the quirky, yet believable personalities they have created. All this, and well-timed action, too!	2002-11-05

Through an incredible stroke of luck, she comes to the attention of Shan yos'Galen, captain of the Dutiful Passage.  Quickly hired and set to training for a fast-track career, Priscilla slowly begins to overcome her negative self-image and her past as she learns to trust and connect with other people. Along the way there is intrigue, romance and adventure as her enemies attempt to slander her and steal the honor she has created for herself.<br />The Liaden universe is a totally original construct with a well thought out set of social systems and codes of honor that fascinate the reader even as they complicate matters for the characters there. This universe is the true strength of the book. It is this that really has me coming back for more, and I will be getting the next book in this series to see how the plotlines set up in Conflict of Honors are resolved.	2002-10-30

That is only one element of the importance of children's picture books -- the STORY is really the main event that sparks imaginations and opens those priceless discussions.  Trupp did not do that for us.<br />As others here have pointed out, Trupp kind of meanders pointlessly on a journey that ends rather abruptly.  The moral of the story is compassion and kindness to the homeless.  I felt that this message was a little obvious and heavyhanded; it almost substituted for an actual storyline.  In the end, Trupp: a Fuzzhead Tale comes across as bland and preachy. <br />There are not a lot of children's picture books out there that address the homeless, and for that I must give Cannon credit for trying to touch on the subject.	2002-10-28

As someone who considers herself a fan of &quot;soft&quot; science fiction (you know, the stuff you don't have to have an engineering degree or a clue about math to follow)I could only shake my head in wonderment when I was finished with Rendezvous with Rama.  How does Clarke do it?<br />Here is a tale of mankind's first encounter with an alien spacecraft coming into our own solar system -- set in the not too distant future when we could conceivably have colonized our own local planets, but not yet explored the galaxy.  The sense of awe, of discovery both delightful and terrifying comes across sharply as we follow a team that sets out to enter and explore the seemingly uninhabited interior of this gigantic environment. All the while events are unfolding in response to Rama's nearing the sun, the author manages to explain the scientific logistics of Rama in terms a lay person like me can clearly understand without being patronizing and without detracting from the characters and their story (which are, true to Clarke's tradition, interesting without being melodramatic). <br />I was reluctant to undertake this book at first, having received the impression that it was too technical and therefore, boring. It was neither.   Now I can't wait to continue the series.	2002-10-28

Although I am probably repeating someone else's words anyway, it is this:  you will be sorry if you never experienced the fantastic worlds therein.<br />Hyperion is but one world in the midst of a gorgeous mess of a universe conceived by Dan Simmons.  The plot, which roughly mirrors The Canterbury Tales' format, involves the telling of personal stories from the points of views of six pilgrims visiting Hyperion. Each knows that there is a probable chance that he will die without ever having his request granted by the Shrike, a menacing creature/machine which seems to exist for no other purpose than to randomly murder people on Hyperion and which can travel through time and space masterfully well.  As the pilgrims' tales unfold, information about this future Hegemony of human planets and the circumstances surrounding it starts to leak out and simultaneously reels the reader in.  Frankly, I was sorry to leave Simmons' seductive world-building more than the characters themselves.<br />I purposely did not read the Fall of Hyperion sequel, which many others say is necessary to understand Hyperion's events, because I wanted to review this as a stand alone novel.  This can be a very confusing book without those latter reveleations, but it stands well indeed. Read it if you are more than a little adventurous and enjoy a satisfying mystery with your sci fi action.	2002-10-21
US	50986119	R2RG16UEQAWFZ0	0345335465	496469815	Dragonflight (Dragonriders of Pern - Volume 1)	Books	5	88	93	N	N	A rare vote from the heart	For me, the thing that makes a book a classic is whether or not it comes to mind occasionally in the year after I have read it. If I don't then find myself comparing it to recently read plotlines or movies from the same genre, it would not be worth a five star rating.  In this case, I have (drumroll please) over 10 years' worth of ponderings and influence to demonstrate that Dragonflight -- and the entire trilogy -- is an unparalleled classic.  <br />Thumbnail sketch of the plot:  a futuristic world barely settled by mankind, which was then cut off from all contact and aid from the motherworld (Earth).  Genetic engineering of native life forms to create \\"Dragons\\" which form psychic links to individual humans (dragonriders)for life, to aid in fighting a recurring biological threat.  Centuries pass between attacks, causing subsequent generations to forget the dragons' purpose, take the dragonriders for granted and weaken their defenses gradually.  Now there are signs that the attacks will begin again soon, and the people are caught unprepared. The stage is set for Lessa, a young insignificant, to rise to the top of the dragonrider heirarchy along with F'lar, a seasoned rider, as his mate.  <br />I was tempted to dock a star from the rating based on some formulaic elements:  the young, fiery, independant-spirited heroine challenging the restrictive views of her medieval society, the super-Alpha male hero who tries to dominate her but comes to appreciate her in the end...if you've read one, you will recognize the Lessa and F'lar characters, as well as some others as such Romance novel archetypes.  Despite this, McCaffrey draws them well and uses her characters perfectly to play up the tension and confusion that Pern is going though.  HOWEVER.  Even if you could hate everything else about this book (not that that's really plausible), you would still have to hand it to McCaffrey for her magnificent, mysterious, humanchild-esque dragons.  It could have had something to dowith my youth at the time, but those dragons made and impression on me that lasts to this day and is still the standard in my mind for the believability of any alien character in a novel. <BR>  <BR>Anne McCaffrey wrote the Harper Hall trilogy and the first Dragonrider trilogy in the earlier days of her writing career.  Some have opined that her latter writings show improvement; I disagree with extreme prejudice.  Or rather, it is not her writing style (mediocre) that elevates the best McCaffrey books, but that infuriatingly elusive freshness that somehow trickled away after that first decade of mainstream success. The unjaded, imaginative approach to her (un)mythological dragons challenged the reader to discard the \\"monster\\" bias and even fall in love a little.  No small feat, that.  <br />Thank you, Anne, for the wonder and delight of Pern and its dragons.	2002-10-18

This book managed to take that plot and turn it into a very bland experience.<br />Disney's Lilo and Stitch: A Read-aloud Storbook is a prime example of why you should never buy something that was obviously made just for merchandising's sake.  Imagine a the script for a children's movie condensed down and simplified into a very tedious play-by-play prose:  that is exactly how this storybook reads.  I can picture the author rushing to finish in time for the deadline as I read.  The best thing that I can say about it is that the illustrations are nice, mainly because they appear to be taken from movie stills. <br /> If you believe that children's books should not only be excellent visually but rich and varied in the use of language as well, there are much better alternatives to this one.  I will not be buying any more Disney books for my children.	2002-10-14

The movie with this title was funny and fabulous.The illustrations appear to be taken directly from movie stills.  This is okay in itself, as the movie was visually appealing.  The prose, if it could be called that, appeared to be lifted directly from a script synopsis; a very bad idea.  Imagine a lackluster, deadpan play-by-play of every sequence in a film read back to you by someone with all the imagination of a court stenographer.  I guarantee you will be as bored reading this to your child as your child will be hearing it. <br />If you, too are of the opinion that children's books should be not only visually appealing but stimulate interest, imagination and language skills, then this is one to pass up.	2002-10-07

Shows great potential	In my personal rating system, 3 stars is the equivalent of a &quot;C&quot; grade.  A Thousand Words for Stranger really deserves a &quot;B-&quot;, but four stars would seem to imply that it was nearly perfect, and that is an exaggeration. Julie Czerneda has created a universe here (the Trade Pact Universe) that has hints of depth, rich histories and fascinating characters. Rather than recap the story, which others here have done already, I can add to their observations a few insights that stuck out at me as I read.  <br />The beginning of the novel focuses on the amnesiac protagonist's struggle to survive amid some confusing and frightening events, aided by a mysterious stranger who takes her in as crew on his starship.  This first half reads like a very lukewarm sci fi/romance hybrid.  It would have lost me soon, but I pride myself on finishing what I start, and so my attention held until Czerneda finally began to showcase her ability to world-build and plot. Then, we start to see more dimensions to Sira, her relatives, and Justin Morgan. <br />I found myself tantalized by the possibilities for future Trade Pact universe novels, but as a whole, this one just didn't deliver on the promise of the second half of the novel, which is when it really began to take off and lead me through interesting plot twists.  The conclusion, while it wrapped up many loose threads, did not resolve enough of them:  it was like eating half a meal.  But by the end of the book, the author did her job well after all; I was hooked to try the next one.  If Czerneda can maintain this level of interest in all the subsequent Trade Pact Universe series, she will be a writer to reckon with indeed.	2002-09-19
US	50986119	RF9JZ4NXGYE68	080696863X	754561394	300 Handcrafted Soaps: Great Melt & Pour Projects	Books	5	74	75	N	Y	Finally!  A melt and pour book worth looking at.	I am a sucker for gorgeously photographed books.  This may have something to do with my five star rating here, but give me a chance to make my case!<br />That being said, there are a few things you should know before buying this book:  1., It is almost strictly a melt and pour soap book, with a brief explanation on how to rebatch but no recipes for such and 2., It is about the fun, creative side of soapmaking, with emphasis on the visual and olfactory effects you can create rather than making \\"skin care\\" products per se.  Of course these soaps are all perfectly functional, gentle and satisfying as soap, but you may find they make even better gifts and conversation pieces.<br />I have made a few so far that caught my eye; indeed, with 300 to choose from, I could not possibly do justice to them all, and I apologize that I can only comment on a small fraction from personal experience.  They are all lovely.<br />First I did the Rubber Ducky embedded on a clear, blue oval base as a finishing flourish on top of a baby shower gift (scented, of course, with fragrance of Baby Powder).  Next, I couldn't resist the Honey soaps, which have bee themes of course and include honey and other skin-beneficial additives like bee pollen or oatmeal.  A few of these are colored and molded to look like bees made out of honey.  There is a Rainbow Loaf, which uses cubes of jewel-colored scraps arranged mosaically in a standard rectangular mold -- a perfect way to finish up on those leftovers. Finally, I tried the Gem soaps, which do a remarkable job of imitating several precious and semi-precious gem stones (my favorite is Amber, with a small plastic ant embedded in it.  Clever!).  I should remark here that many of the special effects achieved are possible only by using glycerine and other transparent melt-and-pour soap bases, a fact which \\"soap snobs\\" should consider.<br />Mainly because they are beautiful and clever, these soaps have qualities which recommmend them for gift giving.  Thereis not a person on your holiday list which could not use a bar of soap (I hope), and somewhere in here is a soap for every man, woman and child, with fragrances and additives that could be custom-tailored.  As I've stated before, this is not about skin care products per se, but the author does include recipes that help there (about a third of the total, or 100) and a reference list of soap bases that have specific beneficial properties and can sub in many of the more decorative recipes.  <br />Most melt and pour books on the shelves have a hastily-done, almost cheesy look and seem to belong with those 10-page booklets you find on the racks at craft stores.  Not so for this one.  If melt-and-pour soapmaking's strength is it's creativeness and beauty, then the craft deserves a quality publication like 300 Handcrafted Soaps to represent it.  <br />My one, tiny little criticism, for which I may have deducted half a star if Amazon would let me, would be the lack of a source list or references to obtain some of the fabulous molds Browning used, or the fascinating fragrances she recommmends for her recipes which don't seem to be easily obtainable in local retail stores.  But, there's always the Internet.	2002-09-13
US	50986119	R1NOC9EN7MSOQ7	0679767800	339858237	The Stars My Destination	Books	5	38	42	N	Y	I am a convert	That this book is over 45 years old and still an \\"underground\\" classic is a travesty.  <br />This author perfected the concept of world building before the phrase was coined.  Bester visualized a future three hundred years from now that will be demolished and reconstructed by humanity's discovery of a talent for teleportation (jaunting).  His insights into how this one factor has affected every level of our society are so fresh and well thought out that my preconceived notions about early sci fi writers being quaint and naiive have been permanently obliterated. <br />If, like me, you also expect the characters and dialog to reflect a '50's cliche, you will be shamed.  Our so-called hero is every bit the foul-mouthed, amoral neanderthal from the beginning, when he is pushed to stretch his mental powers in order to survive abandonment in deep space.  From there on, he uses everything and everyone in his quest for vengeance, which necessitates his surface transformation into an educated, civilized man -- indeed, only his language really cleans up.  The other characters are also revealed one by one to be ruthless and driven, once they have been crossed or betrayed by Gully Foyle.  Bester draws a chilling, fascinating portrait of human nature that is sharpened by dystopia.<br />For all these admittedly dark and depressing themes, this novel avoids melancholy or bleakness.  The pervading feeling is strangely light and hopeful, the people oddly likeable.  At the last fifty pages or so, we find plot twists that cause us to question and reevaluate our assumptions once again.  <br />In all, The Stars My Destination was so well conceived that I can only marvel at the distinct lack of copycat authors in ensuing decades.  Perhaps Bester is in such a class of his own that the rest of the sci fi genre intuitively shys away from mimicry.  Bravo, well done.	2002-09-06

You don't need to read this one.  As other reviewers here have noted, it is formulaic; but in its defense, the formula works, and the dialog is witty and fast paced as ever. Thus I can't in all good conscience give it a one-star heave-ho.  It's just that after six prior Plum novels I'm going stir crazy for Stephanie to change her life a little.<br />To recap for Evanovich newbies, Stephanie Plum is a bounty hunter in New Jersey.  She has a rocky relationship with sexy bad-boy-next-door-turned-good cop Joe Morelli, a quirky slew of friends picked up along her career and an Italian/Hungarian family that doesn't seem to know what to do with their unconventional daughter.  She gets into all kinds of unique scrapes and hilarious situations in the process of enforcing bail bonds.  In every book there are gunfights and vehicles destroyed enough to satisfy any action/thriller junkie.  In the end, Steph always gets her man.<br />Some of the plotlines continued throughout this series involve her boyfriend's fear of commitment and her mom's manipulative attempts to get Stephanie \\"normal\\"ized and settled down to produce grandchildren.  In Seven Up, these finally come to a head, and none too soon.  I was skipping large sections to get to the cliffhanger ending that I knew must be coming.  I am told I can now look forward to the promised changes in Hard Eight's tone and content.  I only wish I could plead directly with the author to resolve these plotlines without somehow breaking the sassy Stephanie Plum spirit that I have come to love.	2002-06-26

In the end, the charm of this book won me over completely.<br />This is a book for someone who has a basic knowledge of gardening.  Indeed, the title hints at this but most of us would expect a gardening book to cater to beginners, which it doesn't.  In fact, I would say that it would be best if the reader had at least tried growing melons once before.  Apparently, melons are a little more high-maintenance than tomatoes and beans -- but the author only spares a small cursory section on melon culture, the better to get down to the real reason to own this treasure:  a thoroughly engaging and informative tribute to each known variety of heirloom melon still surviving today.<br />Each melon variety is comprehensively detailed with a photograph and a short history and description. Amy Goldman makes a very good case for the growing of heirloom (Open Pollinated)varieties, by the way.  I won't get into the details, but if superior flavor is your reason for growing your own produce, heirlooms will blow all those mealy, watery grocery store hybrids right off their shelves. By the time you get two pages into the gorgeously photographed catalog of her melons you will be salivating and wishing you had gotten the jump on the summer planting season a little earlier.  Before you finish this book you will decide that nothing else but your very own Charentais cantaloupes (12 and 1/4 on the Brix sweetnes scale) and Cream of Saskatchewan watermelons (10 degrees Brix) will do.<br />Bottom line is, this book will light a fire under you to develop a genuine passion about your home garden and the types of fruits you grow in it. So I can recommend this book even though I have yet to apply its advice to the actual growing. After all, you need the inspiration before you can get off your duff to apply the perspiration!	2002-06-03

She gave me regular chores growing up, so naturally I assumed I knew everything I needed to about homemaking.<br />Well, this book showed me the huge gaps in my understanding as well as giving me a kick in the pants to do the chores I always put off.  It is a lot easier to do a chore when you finally understand the &quot;why's&quot; as well as a more efficient way to do them!  Not to mention that the author includes simple and inexpensive recipes for cleaners that beat commercial mixes.<br />As a result of following only some of the advice, my health and my family's has improved over the last month due to a reduction in allergic attacks and improved hygeine.  The most reassuring aspect of this book is that the information can be custom tailored to your individual situation and household -- you don't have to do everything to benefit.  It also makes a great occasional reference book, as some have pointed out.  Home Comforts belongs in everybody's home library.	2001-04-10

I had read the entire matrix of destiny trilogy before I ever got to High Energy, and loved the quirky characters that Dara has such a talent for introducing.  So imagine my surprise when the least sci-fi of her romances -- if it can be called sci-fi at all -- turned out to have the most imaginitive and witty chemistry! <br />Tyber and Zanita have a classic &quot;George and Gracie&quot; dialog thing going, and they are both too lovable.  Tyber's only fault from this reader's perspective is a somewhat condescending attitude toward Zanita's career as a reporter for the local paper.  Hey, almost perfect is a heck of a lot better than most of the run of the mill jerks that pose for romance heroes. Zanita is the only female in the known universe non-linear (read: weird) enough to confound him. Together they create a delightful duo, setting forth to solve a mystery involving a local con artist.  <br />A note to Matrix of Destiny fans:  There's just enough left unexplained and hinted at to cause me to doubt that Tyber is entirely human; his Familiar-like cat is the best allusion to the Matrix of Destiny trilogy that Dara could have thrown in .  Not to mention his eccentric lifestyle and the fact that he is an extraordinaryily gifted genius/Renaissance man.  Perhaps this is the seed for a future tie-in novel between the two universes.  We can only hope.	2001-01-02

That must be the case with Wizard's First Rule, because nothing inside justifies it's  apparently immense popularity. I'm not saying it was trash, just that  anyone who has read more than 5 or so fantasy novels will keep having deja  vu, and that more experienced readers will feel patronized by the  overly-simplified style.<br />As other reviewers have pointed out before me,  the writing is undersophisticated.  I would guess the appropriate reading  level to be 13 years old, which is actually inappropriate if you assume  that the average scifi/fantasy reader is probably quite a bit older than  that.  If the awkward sentences were supposed to be from the point of view  of a kid, then perhaps I could understand, but the hero is a full-grown  adult.<br />Even more than the bad dialog and prose, the author seems to have  hit every cliche in the genre.  The love interest established in the first  chapter, starting on a quest to stop an evil lord with a ragtag band that  somehow includes a wizard, the enchanted sword, the sorceress they meet  along the way who speaks in riddles.  A villian named Darken Rahl (Star  Wars, anyone?) I could go on, but if this sounds familiar so far, you've  had enough to get the picture.  <br />Yes, Goodkind has a few smatterings of  original ideas, but they're not enough to pull the book off.  I only made  myself finish it because based on this series' success, I kept hoping that  it would get better, and because I have a rule that if it's worth starting,  it's worth finishing...but now I'm not so sure. <br />Bottom line:  if you're  new to fantasy, and/or under 13, this book will be just your speed.	2000-07-06

In establishing my first-ever vegetable garden this year, I gradually became aware of the world of heirlooms through catalog sources and brief mentions in other books.  If I had only started out with Heirloom Country  Gardens: Timeless Treasures for Today's Gardeners, I would have been  inspired to double my growing space to include the gorgeous flowers and  kitchen edibles described in this book. <br />The first section is devoted to  exploring the most typical varieties of heirloom gardens; starting with  historical tidbits, followed by planting and growing tips, and ending with  a sample layout for 21st Century gardeners complete with suggested  varieties. Next, we have categorical descriptions of vegetables, herbs,  fruits and flowers alongside the author's notes on recommended strains.   This section actually comprises more than half the book and is a great  introduction for beginners.  Following up are tips and general guidelines  for heirloom gardening, including seed saving and organic techniques. This  is strongly stressed thoughout the book as important aspects of preserving  our heritage of genetic diversity in crops and sound stewardship of the  planet's resources.<br />This isn't going to cover the complete world of  heirlooms(is that even possible?), but the novice reader will have had  enough to digest with what is presented here.  It will be as if a whole new  world has been exposed behind the well-advertised facade of hybrids and  chemical-based gardening. Fortunately, it is also presented in clear,  direct language that neither overwhelms nor dumbs down the subject for  newcomers to heirloom gardening.  <br />A very motivating and useful guide  that I will be sure to revisit often!	2000-06-25

I thought I was buying this book for my son to read a few years down the road when he fell into the 4-8 age range recommended.  Imagine my reaction when, at 20 months, he started to push it onto my lap every morning saying,  &quot;Bees!  Bees!&quot;  Now I'm not claiming my son is some sort of  prodigy.  I think this book is just one of those gems that captures the  interest of children exceptionally well. True, part of it is undoubtably  the illustrated overlays.  Well, if reading this book to him now because of  the fun pictures gets a child exposed to science and the world aroung him,  it might lead to a real enthusiasm for the subject matter down the road. I  can foresee many more of these first discovery books on our shelf soon!  <br />The one thing that disappointed me enough to subtract a star from my  rating was the lack of any information about the dangerous side of bees.   No mention at all was made of their stingers, or that humans should keep  clear of the hive unless they are properly outfitted and trained to handle  bees.  Parents will have to remember to stress this point on their  own.<br />Otherwise, the text was very thorough in describing these creatures,  their habits and social structure, as well as defining the bees' role in  the natural world.  The tone was straightforward and nonpatronizing enough  that I found it interesting even as an adult.  This book will definitely  have a space on our shelf for all the children to come.	2000-06-12

The author does a good job of explaining the background story on heirlooms vs. hybrids,  pros and cons, etc.  The pictures were charming, showing each species in  it's place in an old-fashioned homestyle garden as opposed to the more  usual catalog-style photos and illustrations I'd come to expect from books  of this type.  <br />There were generally two-page spreads on each vegetable,  flower, herb, etc. that had a poetic introduction and gave step-by-step  instructions in general planting.  The author seemed to have picked one  example of each garden favorite and expanded in detail on it.  For example,  the only heirloom apple covered is the Pink Pearl, the only sunflower was  Inca, the only pumpkin was Lumina.  Beyond that there was no real  discussion on a wider scope of different species within that category.   That's okay, but I wish there was a little more information on what  alternative heirlooms might do well in different zones of the USA.  Also,  the subjects of pests and disease are treated as though the reader is  already expected have enough knowledge to do without it, except to  encourage the use of organic methods wherever possible. <br />So, don't expect  this to be a teaching manual for the newcomer to general gardening  techniques.  But, it is a nice sampling of heirlooms you may never have  heard of otherwise. Thanks to this book, I have now tasted the best tomato  I have ever had in my life (Brandywine).	2000-05-18

The &quot;hate it&quot; reviewers seemed to be mostly annoyed by a writing style they called &quot;amateurish&quot; and a  predictable plot, but mostly they complained about stock characters and  cliches.  I started out as one of the &quot;hate it&quot;s, but after the  first few pages I started to put my finger on why I kept having flashbacks  to jr. high school -- this book was never meant for a 31 year old!<br />The  reading level in Last Dragonlord is about 15 years or under -- a step above  the Harry Potter books, but not a huge step.  Several plot elements seem,  IMHO, to read like a 13-year-old girl's daydreams; romance novel plotline,  being able to change into a dragon and fly away, intelligent horse  companions.  I suspect that most of the &quot;love it&quot; reviews were by  teenage girls.  As soon as I got over my prejudice that I should be reading  an adult-level novel, I began to enjoy myself.<br />The only reason I can come  up with for it's classification in the Fantasy category is that there are a  few passages that are a bit too sexualized for younger readers.  Tor  Fantasy should have edited them out and shelved TLD in the &quot;young  adult&quot; section of the bookstore.<br />So, if you're a teenager with  average reading skills and just LOVE dragons, I can honestly recommend this  book.  Otherwise, you may feel annoyed that you spent an afternoon reading  it.	2000-03-09

The Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle is a book that my mom read to me pre- kindergarten.  I recently picked it up in a bookstore and was amazed at how it still brought back the  feeling of wonder at the mysteries of nature.  No, it is not meant to be a  factual text that teaches scientific concepts to preschoolers -- neither  are fairy tales and nursery rhymes, but I don't hear anybody saying they  were disappointed in the lack of accuracy of Mother Goose! Instead, this  delightful little gem does something much more valuable; it sparks interest  and a sense of wonder.  That is something only the best books are capable  of.	2000-02-21

I am a loyal McCaffrey fan, so please don't  take this as some kind of &quot;Anne-bashing&quot;--but, The Dolphins of  Pern just wasn't up to par with the first two trilogies.  While the concept  of the friendly, talking dolphins is appealing, the storyline goes all over  the place, jumping over years in Readis' and other characters' lives,  losing focus and generally feeling less like a plot than an ongoing report  on the amazing new dolphins.  I hope Anne isn't just writing in response to  pressures from fans and her publisher, but I have a bad feeling that she  became bored with Pern years ago.  Read this book only if you are a Pern  fanatic.	2000-02-20

This book was a revelation for me.  I have actually made the Simple Chocolate Cake with Dark Chocolate Glaze, Rice Pudding and  Lemon-Marbled Cheesecake, all from scratch! It wasn't nearly as hard as I'd  thought.  And nobody guessed that any of it was low-fat. Although I rarely  take the time to write reviews, this kind of unqualified success deserves  recognition.   If you have always been intimidated by &quot;gourmet&quot;  recipes, and if you want to have your lowfat cake and eat it, too-- this  book is a must!	1999-11-16

Therefore, I developed a much less biased opinion than I might have. I  think The Silver Wolf's style shares a lot in common with Rice's vampire  novels, but this only became obvious to me after I made the connection.   However, there's enough difference between these two authors that I think  the constant comparisons going on are really unfair to them both. The  Silver Wolf explores the werewolf legend from a fresh angle.  There is no  hint of any compulsive murdering on the part of the werewolves, or  bloodlust for human flesh.  Indeed, they are portrayed as more human and  humane than anyone else in the plot.  The imagery is rich and takes on the  quality of a dream from time to time.  The romantic subplot between  Regeanne and Maniel (werewolf main characters)is convincing but I felt that  it came too late and was hastily explored.<br />Overall, this was one of my  favorite werewolf novels.  The criticisms I've heard about it, such as the  plot dragging in the first half and being a bit fragmented, are true enough  in my opinion, which is why I rated only four stars.<br />PS-the official book  review states that Lucilla was Maniel's mother--I don't know where that  came from, unless that particular reviewer was just confused by the  fragmented storyline and numerous flashback scenes.	1999-10-23
US	50986119	R2ZLVGA7V9OAKL	0553567772	295997143	Prince of Shadows	Books	4	6	7	N	N	It wasn't hard to fall in love with Kieran Holt.	This was a beautiful and tender love story between a werewolf and a wolf researcher. Unlike other werewolf novels currently on the market, Prince of Shadows plays down the gorier and darker aspects of such supernatural  creatures and surprises us with a very human hero who just happens to have  certain special abilities. The love story and the supernatural subplot  complemented eachother well. My only real dissatisfaction was with the  cover; a beefcake depiction of Kieran posing with his shirt shrugged off,  looking for all the world like a chippendale thug.  I was embarrassed to be  seen with it.   Krinard lived up to my expectations created from her first  werewolf novel, Prince of Wolves -- I wonder if she plans on making this a  trilogy?  I think her fans would love to explore the hidden village of  Valle Cache a bit further.	1998-11-30
