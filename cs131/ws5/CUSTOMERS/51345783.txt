No, it isn't Tolstoy or Dickens, but when I picked it up, I didn't want to read Tolstoy or Dickens. <br /> <br />I'm sure that a Hollywood producer has already bought the rights to make it into a movie.

I have never been to Las Vegas; the last time I was in Atlantic City if there were casinos, I certainly didn't know about them;  I have bet and lost a few dollars in slot machines.  In other words, I know next to nothing about gambling and absolutely nothing about a gambler stacking the odds in his favor through intelligent, obsessive, dizzyingly difficult planning.<br />Ben Mezrich's BRINGING DOWN THE HOUSE is bound to become a movie:  it is non-fiction that reads like one of the most exciting, fascinating novels you could pick up.  Briefly (and simplisticly) six M.I.T. &quot;nerd&quot; students set about to win big  at the tables in Vegas...and they did...by learning to count the cards in games of Blackjack.  Sound simple?  Well, the planning and execution that this entails is unbelievably hard, especially for someone like myself who is no good with math and/or numbers and has no patience for details, whatsoever.<br />I don't want to give away too many of Mezrich's surprises, but I promise you that his book is absolutely impossible to put down.  When I didn't have a huge grin on my face, my mouth had dropped open in shock.  This is a REAL caper adventure...one that I think I'd love to be a part of, but, upon reflection, know that it takes stronger hearts than mine.  The guys who opened up their lives to Mezrich deserve everything they got.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	2002-10-05

It actually took me this long to collect my thoughts about this astounding achievement.  ATONEMENT is quite simply one of the most moving, beautifully written contemporary novels I have ever read.  As opposed to the last McEwan novel I read, AMSTERDAM, which was a tour de force of black, comic word play, ATONEMENT is a novel of character in which true, vivid but bleak emotions are always in play.  <br />The book is divided into three distinct sections:  the first deals with a British family at their great home, much like E.M. Forster might have written; the second part which takes place several years later during World War 2 takes us to France and part three is in 1999 and we are returned to the family home at a birthday party for one of the three leading characters, a celebrated novelist, who, during her childhood committed a crime so cruel that she has spent her entire life looking for some sort of atonement.<br />The depiction of the horrors of war in the second part of this novel is the most shattering I've ever read mainly because of McEwan's varied and specific details dealing with the lives of several soldiers retreating after a major defeat.  One of these soldiers has been wrongly imprisoned for the crime in part one.  Every other character is new to the reader, but fully and beautifully developed.  Every section, every single page is so filled with life, both good and bad, romantic and villainous, nostalgic and adventure-laden that one cannot help but read and be thrilled at McEwan's control and mastery.  <br />This is absolutely a book to treasure.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2002-09-15

I was immediately reminded of John Huston's brilliant movie, THE MISFITS in which, Montgomery Clift who could easily have been playing one of these very cowboys, calls his home to sadly tell his family that he has failed, once again, to win a prize or top money.  A desperately sad scene, played brilliantly by Clift, written by none other than Arthur Miller.<br />Arena Editions has produced a handsome volume for Wouter Deruytter's magnificent pictures in which the horses, riders, clouds, mesas and mountains look as if they come directly from a John Ford western starring John Wayne.  Here we see young men preparing themselves for tests as grueling as chivalric games from the Middle Ages.<br />I do not usually like alot of text accompanying books of photographs:  I prefer to let the images speak for themselves.  That said, John Wood's wonderful essay &quot;Youthful Elegance and the Masks of Destiny&quot; helps a city slicker like myself  understand exactly what Deruytter's photographs are saying.<br />Some of my favorites include a little boy sitting astride a metal barrel pretending that the barrel is his first rodeo horse, the same boy practicing wrapping tape around his wrist as his older mentor/idol/friend does the same, a pen filled with black, brown, white horses looking as if they would give the world to be free and, finally, an unnamed cowboy stretching his legs, getting ready for the games, doing a deep bend, so very close in looks to a ballet dancer's plier.  This is a beautiful, moving book.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2002-08-08

And so, another Bloomsbury edition, David Leavitt's FLORENCE, A DELICATE CASE is not your \\"run-of-the-mill-go-visit-this-museum-and-then-have-pasta-in-this-trattoria\\" travel book. (It is actually the third volume in Bloomsbury's \\"Writer and The City\\" series.) Both White's and Leavitt's books are extremely personal, sincere takes on one of the authors' favorite cities. Naturally, since Leavitt has chosen to live in Italy and to study Florence, he knows the city very, very well. Interestingly, he knows the literary and social history of the city. Even more interesting to me is his knowledge of how and why Florence has appealed to any number of artists from Tschaikovsky to E.M. Forster and fellow \\"travel\\" essayist, Mary McCarthy. This is a beautifully written and beautifully produced book. The jacket design and photograph are particularly handsome. <br />A good deal of this very small volume is spent on homosexual tradition and history in Florence, naturally enough since homosexuality informs all of Leavitt's writings, fiction and non-fiction, either in the forefront or on the back burner.<br />And almost best of all, at the book's close, Leavitt treats the reader to an index bulging with titles and short descriptions of guide books, novels, memoirs, poems, etc. all of which have Florence as their spring-board. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED both for the plane-hopping traveller and the one stuck in an armchair.	2002-07-23

Bianchi always manages to tell the viewer something intimate about his models, and most of the time with no words whatsoever. Until ON THE COUCH,  I had only known Bianchi's black and white pictures. I am not a fan of color images and have none in my collection. That said, I cannot praise these photographs highly enough.<br />Bianchi's use of props is minimal: fresh flowers, clothes and, of course, that couch. It is a rich brown leather. And as one of the models says, \\"If this couch could talk...\\" It practically does.<br />These tremendously beautiful, color photographs are all of handsome male models in various stages of undress and...intimacy on that couch. The pictures are stimulating, frank and totally uncensored.<BR>They are not for an audience searching for 'G' rated photographs. I loved every single one of them.	2002-07-22

It is simply the finest book I know about the theatre and what it was like to work on Broadway in the 1920's thru the 1950's. It was a true tragedy that Hart died so young, robbing not only his family of husband and father, but the world of a great playwright and director and chronicler of his times.<br />This is a funny, perceptive, first-hand account of life in the fast lane of one of the best playwrights Broadway has ever produced. An obsessive worker (it was the stress of his constant work that ultimately killed him), a perfectionist, a brilliant upstart, Hart teamed with George S. Kaufman to write some of the best and funniest plays of the first half of the 20th century...and even today. Is there really a better play about a family coping through love during the Depression than \\"You Can't Take It With You?\\" (That was a rhetorical question). And as Nathan Lane proved only two years ago, \\"The Man Who Came To Dinner\\" is very much worth reviving in a first class production even if you have already seen it in your local community or dinner theatre. The autobiography doesn't so much end as it stops and it is obvious that Hart meant to write a second and, perhaps, a third volume that would include his other writing partners, his Hollywood career, his directing, etc.<br />Steven Bach has written a biography of Hart's entire life called DAZZLER, THE LIFE AND TIMES OF MOSS HART that is a fine companion to Hart's own, unbeatable ACT ONE.

Reading the reviews below I was struck over and over by the fact that people are comparing Rakoff to David Sedaris.  Besides the facts that they are both young, gay and urban, what's to compare?  Yes, they are both writers of humorous (North) American fiction, but then so were Dorothy Parker and Erma Bombeck.  <br />Reading Rakoff immediately reminds me of a time when I invited a television producer/friend to my home in upstate New York.  He quietly, politely refused, \\"Gee, Stuart, I'm kinda frightened of places without sidewalks.\\"  Yes, Rakoff is that urban.  Rakoff's urbanity makes Woody Allen seem like a suburbanite.<br />Rakoff is not afraid to make fun of himself, knowing that there are lots of Canadian-fearing, antisemitic homophobes out there who are waiting with baited breath to put him down.  And that's not paranoia.  That's wonderful, funny, charming, clever, intelligent, witty, weird writing. I made the mistake of taking my newly purchased copy of FRAUD to a hamburger joint where I laughed out loud until I made a total fool of myself.  It was the three kids at the table next to mine, pointing and staring, who made me close the book and leave the restaurant.  <br />If you have ever lived in New York or know someone who has or if you would simply like to laugh til you hurt, read Rakoff.  You won't be far into the book when you'll be shaking your head, sighing, \\"Oh, God, it's me!\\"  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2002-06-09

But, let's face it:  the Met is a performing arts organization and, therefore every civilian who watches or listens to even one opera from the Met, becomes a financial and artistic critic.<br />Conductor James Levine, one of the Met's treasures, and, in fact, one of the world's musical treasures, gets the lion's share of attention and adoration, but Fielder is \\"relatively fair\\" to more famous names like Marian Anderson and Placido Domingo, Cecilia Bartoli and Beverly Sills, Maria Callas and Enrico Caruso, et al.  For snide laughs, start with the gossip surrounding the firing of Kathleen Battle; for grim adventure, there is the real murder of violinist Helen Hagnes; if you believe that the Met, to survive, has got to hire more experimental directors, read about John Dexter and his defeat at Lincoln Center; if you believe that the Met, to survive, must continue to hire more lavish directors, read about Franco Zeffirelli and his opera-as-spectacle policy; if you, like most, get your only opera experience from The Three Tenors, there are pieces on all three of them and an extra long chapter on the, arguably, most famous singer of all time, Luciano Pavarotti.	2002-05-27

It is not that I find A Reader's opinions so difficult to swallow (obviously, not everyone can enjoy every book) but it is the anger inherent in those reviews which I find dismaying.  They convey the attitude of &quot;how dare Marlo Thomas have something published which I don't care to read!&quot;<br />Frankly, I don't go out of my way to buy and read &quot;self-help&quot; books of inspiration through the words of others.  It was this specific collection of people that made me gravitate towards it.  There are so many people represented here whom I respect and/or am interested in:  Cal Ripken Jr., Itzhak Perlman, Anna Quindlen, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, etc.  I wanted to read the words and deeds that at one time or another helped them.  No, I do not expect the effects to last my lifetime, I do not expect to be miraculously changed by the different stories, but it seems to me that at this particular moment in the world's history, perhaps reading of Uta Hagen's mother's opening night advice, Dennis Miller's thank you to Jay Leno or Senator John McCain's sense of patriotism will brighten a particularly dark mood.

The gardens and terraces as well as all the rooms open to the public are filled with wonderful examples of the modern art collected by Guggenheim, including, tellingly, a larger-than-life white statue of a horse situated outdoors on the main terrace overlooking the canal.  The horse has a happy male rider.  The rider sports a large erection.<br />So who was Peggy Guggenheim?  Anton Gill goes a long way to providing her with a lasting memorial but far from a stuffy one.  His well-researched, entertainingly and wittily written book ART LOVER is a fascinating read.  Guggenheim was not one of the wealthier Guggenheims; her Dad went down on the Titanic and she was left with a goodly sum of money, but far from the vast fortunes her relatives had.  And so, as Richard Adler & Jerry Ross said about their heroine, Lola, in \\"Damn Yankees,\\" Guggenheim used \\"A Little Brains, A Little Talent (With An Emphasis On The Latter).\\"  She had, according to her own account over one thousand \\"sexual liasons\\" with men as famous as Samuel Beckett and as nasty and vicious as her alcoholic first husband who emotionally and physically abused her.<br />She knew she was not a great beauty (in fact in one of the terrific photos collected for the book she resembles Dame Edna!)so she used her brains and superb taste and knowledge of a true bargain to collect art from men as diverse and influential as Brancusi, Mondrian, Pollock, Duchamp and Ernst (her second husband), most of which were purchased during World War 2 when so many artists were fleeing Europe and selling their works cheaply.<br />Peggy Guggenheim was a true American original who led a wild life of art, society and sexual high-jinks in several countries and she has left us, at least, a wonderful, wonderful gallery of modern art in a Venetian palace, most of us can only dream about living in.  Gill has done her proud.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	2002-05-01

You go away from the movie with doubts in your mind (questions keep pricking you over and over) and then the \\"Vertigo\\" vertigo starts:  How did they do it?  How did they get away with it and why?  Why is James Stewart so obsessed with, at first, a living woman and then, tragically, a dead woman?  Why does Kim Novak allow Stewart to manipulate her into becoming a different person?  Why do the director and author tell the audience who-done-it long before the movie is over? (This is a particularly thorny point in Auiler's book).  And those are only the questions which pop to mind after a first viewing with no preconceptions.<br />With a foreward (really a short appreciation of \\"Vertigo\\")by Martin Scorsese, Dan Auiler's book is a \\"Vertigo\\" encyclopedia:  the author has collected color and black & white photographs from the film and from ad campaigns; he shows us reproductions of Hitchcock's famous storyboards; he has researched and explained how and why the screenplay was written (and by whom!)and lets us know how Hitchcock participated in the writing in this and everyone of his films and why the studio did not want Hitchcock to direct this movie, preferring that he do another African adventure after the success of \\"The Man Who Knew Too Much.\\" We learn how Bernard Herrmann's score came about and was recorded,  why the specific actors were chosen for their roles and how they worked with their director, how the movie was made ready for the public and how the public received it, originally and in its re-release.  There is also a discussion of the process used in making VERTIGO which was called Vistavision.  <br />Auiler also explains the process by which this great, sad, twisted, dark, mysterious, complicated, brave movie was saved from destruction by complete restoration, a painstaking process that directors such as Scorsese support and fund on a regular basis.<br />This book is a must-read for any fans of Alfred Hitchcock, of \\"Vertigo\\" and, indeed, for any film fans.

To my knowledge, no new movies were ever shown at The New Yorker.  I saw my first Depression age films there.  Barbara Stanwyck, Carole Lombard, Henry Fonda, Dick Powell, Clark Gable, Claudette Colbert and Preston Sturges were some of my heroes.  But it was after a retrospective of all the black and white musicals that Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers did from 1933 (\\"Flying Down To Rio\\") til 1939 (\\"The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle\\") that I was hooked.  I couldn't get enough of Astaire and Rogers.<br />I think I saw \\"Top Hat\\" ten times over a period of that many years.  It is still one of my favorite movies, as is \\"Follow the Fleet\\" in which Rogers, surprisingly, sings one of her only two solos in all of their films...Irving Berlin's delightful \\"Let Yourself Go.\\"  I always laugh when I see \\"Shall We Dance\\" and, to this day, I don't really understand the plot of \\"Carefree.\\"  Nor do I care.<br />There have been many wonderful books about this dancing, singing, sweetly romantic & comic couple who were obviously a big antidote to the sad, penny-pinching days in the 1930's when most women could not afford a gown seemingly made entirely of  feathers nor did most men walk around in tails each night.  Floors in most homes were not black and white shellacked diamonds, nor did most people pilot their private airplanes in order to dance the night away in Venice.  Astaire and Rogers brought glamour and happiness and sexiness to their public.  And they were fun.<br />Edward Gallefent's relatively brief but thoroughly researched book does not so much put emphasis on the miraculous musical numbers written by the best in the business (besides Berlin, there were scores written by the Gershwins and Jerome Kern and Cole Porter.)nor the choreography by Astaire and his collaborator, Hermes Pan, which has, in my mind, never been bettered.<br />Instead of concentrating on these numbers, Gellefent has written a scholarly, academic book about the \\"hidden\\" symbolic meanings in the gestures, character names, dance steps, etc.  which, in his mind, makes this irreplaceable team, \\"important.\\"  Well, they already were \\"important\\" before Gellefent examined their every minute move.  They were important because they were two of the best entertainers movie nuts like me ever saw and, luckily, we can still see them on videotape and DVD's and, hopefully one day, in a new or renovated theatre devoted to movies of the first half of the twentieth century.<br />If you are looking for books on Astaire and Rogers, I suggest you try ASTAIRE DANCING by John Mueller or STARRING FRED ASTAIRE by Stanley Green and Burt Goldblatt or, best of all, Arlene Croce's THE FRED ASTAIRE AND GINGER ROGERS BOOK which comes complete with one of those clever \\"flip-the-pages-quickly-and-watch-them-DANCE.\\"  Their like will never pass this way again.	2002-04-21

Most of the characters could have come off of the Hollywood cutting room floor, taken out of a \\"B\\" movie because they were exceedingly trite.  I do not want to tell you too many details since surprise is an element of any mystery, but the main conceit (The hero, Greg Cannon, meets and has sex with a young drifter.  This drifter is found soon afterward with a major, closeted Hollywood star...both of them dead in a hot tub.  And Greg feels so \\"connected\\" with the drifter, after one sexual experience, that he sets out to prove in a very long 320 pages that the men did not commit suicide) had me shaking my head in disbelief in chapter after chapter.  Monette's over-use of hundred dollar words and simplistic metaphors is in direct contrast with his total simplicity and honesty in his autobiographies.  (i.e.: \\"Though Artie had only made the mildest pass, the centrifugal motion seemed to push the moment to a pitch\\" or<BR>\\"The smell of lilies was so intense that after a while it began to seem not real---as cheap as the dollar toilet water they bottled to sell at the airport\\" or \\"...the screw was turning ever tighter.\\" <br />The only people I'd recommend this limp mystery to are those who love Monette's work already and want to read everything he wrote.	2002-04-15

The nine stories contained in THE MARBLE QUILT contain some of the best, most exciting writing Leavitt has ever done.  They are on a par with his best novels like THE LOST LANGUAGE OF CRANES and the stories in his masterly FAMILY DANCING.<br />The title story is one of Leavitt's strangest and most satisfying:  in several brief episodes, an American is questioned by Italian police in the matter of his ex-lover's murder.  The reader never gets a neat solution to who the murderer is nor why or when or how Tom was killed, but parts of his life, including his new hobby of stealing pieces of marble, reveal an anger and hostility toward the narrator/lover who obviously is more in control of his emotions, more rational, more able to live the life of an outsider.<br />In THE INFECTION SCENE Lord Alfred Douglas, before, during and after his affair with Oscar Wilde is contrasted, in alternating scenes, with a present day, young San Franciscan, who naively, dangerously believes that his love for a man infected with HIV, can only be tested and proven by becoming infected himself.  I found Leavitt's footnotes charming and funny and (possibly) justifiably spiteful given the brouhaha surrounding, arguably, his best novel WHILE ENGLAND SLEEPS.<br />In, perhaps, the saddest of the stories, BLACK BOX, the grieving widower of a famous designer killed in an unexplained plane crash becomes involved emotionally, physically and intellectually with a stranger who, at every turn, presents surprise after horrible surprise, including a videotape of the dead designer waiting for his plane in the airport.<br />In these stories, Leavitt experiments with form and content; he brings humor to even the most gloomy of subjects and gives the reader great, great pleasure.  These are brilliant stories which must be savored and re-read.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2002-02-11

Karinska worked with many other famous creative people in her long and varied career including  Agnes De Mille, Jerome Robbins, Franco Zeffirelli and George Cukor to name just a few.<br />This oversized book contains scores of wonderful photographs and sketches in color and in black and white including, to me, the most interesting part of the book:  descriptions of how Karinska took \\"raw\\" sketches by artists such as Noguchi, Dali, Chagall, etc. and, literally, turned them into costumes.<br />Bentley writes gracefully and wittily and, most importantly, she doesn't only write for dance professionals.<br />Treat yourself to this relatively expensive but very much worthwhile history of costume in the last century and the personal and professional life of the woman who \\"dressed\\" so many major stars from Gypsy Rose Lee to Laurence Olivier.

It is easy to see why Maira Kalman's MAX IN HOLLYWOOD, BABY received a citation as \\"one of the ten best illustrated books of 1991.\\"  Those illustrations contain as many wonderful surprises and secrets, double meanings and jokes as the words they sit with.  Even the end papers are filled with delightful drawings of dozens of Hollywood superstars from Charlie Chaplin and Fanny Brice to Judy Garland and Jean-Paul Belmondo.<br />The text is, I guess, written to entertain children but it is just as charming and entertaining to this adult with its story of the \\"real\\" Hollywood:  Dozens of wacky Show-Biz types appear including the psychic to the stars, Madame Gilzelka; the producer, Bella Broccoli, who insists on drinking a concoction which produces \\"the secret of youth;\\" and his \\"tantalizing\\" starlet Monica Zitti; The hero is, of course, Max,the dog/movie-lover who becomes Mr. Stravinsky, hot-shot director pining to be a celebrity. (\\"I won't have conversations, I'll just have monologues.\\")  Can our Max handle the pressure?  the pretense?  Well, you'll have to read the book to find out.  Along the way you'll also discover why Ferrrnando Extra Debonnaire who studied at the Royal Academy of Driving Directors tells Max, \\"Watch your step in this town.  There are some back-stabbing, power-hungry, status-seeking vegetarians here.\\"  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, especially for those readers determined to have a career in the movies, no matter how high the cost.	2002-02-09

When I say that this volume is a &quot;nice treat&quot; I do not want any readers to think that it is as satisfying or gratifying as the movie, itself.  It is what a nice dessert is to a rich, fulfilling meal.  If you've seen and loved Joseph L. Mankiewicz's film, then you might want to pick up this book to scim through afterwards or to read in big or small chunks.  But one can't really only eat the dessert--it should be the sweet AFTER the main course.<br />&quot;ALL ABOUT 'ALL ABOUT EVE'&quot; is more for lovers of Trivia than it is for lovers of pertinent and important movie-history facts.  Is it really important for you to know that the best friends in the movie, played by Bette Davis and Celeste Holm, were barely on  civil speaking terms?  Is it truly necessary for you to know that Davis and her leading man Gary Merrill lived their hot-blooded, tempestuous romance off-screen as well as on-screen?  Is it absolutely pertinent for you to know who the now-forgotten European actress is whom the character of 'Margo Channing' (the Bette Davis character) was  based on in the original novel by Mary Orr?  Do you really want to know about all the hirings and firings of the second-rate Broadway musical which is based on this altogether first-rate movie?  If so, this is definitely the book for you.<br />What turned me off was Sam Staggs' decision to put into his &quot;history&quot; book, his own personal, critical opinions of various performances, films, scripts and plays.  In this kind of book, it seems to me, facts--the author's documented research-- are what are important, not his own opinions.  Also, in a first quick scimming, I found a few mistakes, one of which is not trivial at all--it is a matter of authorship:  Lee Adams is givencredit by Staggs for writing the lyrics to the song &quot;Tomorrow&quot; from the long-running Broadway musical ANNIE when, actually, the lyricist is Martin Charnin.<br />The front cover blurb declares that ALL ABOUT EVE is the &quot;bitchiest film ever made!&quot;  It is, of course, much more than that.  It is blistering and brilliant in conception and execution and, because of videotape tapes and DVD's future viewers will be able to watch this classy, funny, bitter, knowing look into the hearts of a group of people who love and hate one another, who romance and betray, who bolster up and rip apart one another, all in the name of The Theatre.	2002-01-20

Alot of this book reads like a medical journal.  That being said, alot of this book will astound and delight anyone who has even a slight fondness for animals...not just dogs, mind you, but all animals.<br />Most of the stories in the book are about dogs, but as a cat owner and lover, I was pleased to find enough anecdotes about felines who knew the exact time when their owners were going to come home, who knew the person on the other end of a telephone and who knew that their owners were in some kind of grave physical or emotional trouble.  There are pets in this book who, we are told, knew that a human diabetic or epileptic fit was on the horizon and we even read of pets who could sniff out cancerous lesions.  There are tales of horses, fish, termites, monkeys and more with telepathic powers.<br />Pet owners from all over the world were obviously eager to relate their stories to Rupert Sheldrake, even those whose stories are terribly sad in the extreme:  animals who, through their own mysterious telepathy, knew of the deaths of people close to them or even of the owners, themselves, who knew, from very far distances, that their pets were in harm's way.<br />True, some of the stories are weird enough to have been written by the folks living on Planet Xerbo, but enough are them are stimulating and just shocking enough to make believers of us all.	2002-01-19

Before I read, re-read and loved &quot;Light in August,&quot; I had tried books like &quot;Absalom, Absalom&quot; and &quot;The Sound and The Fury&quot; countless times only to get bogged down in the convoluted grammar and personal symbolism as well as the dialogue.  For some reason, when I was ready to really read and concentrate, it was certainly not easy, but it was a great, distinct pleasure....one that has stayed with me. Faulkner is, as novelist and essayist Ralph Ellison calls him, &quot;...the greatest artist the South has produced.&quot;<br />This Modern Library compilation of some of Faulkner's short stories is a perfect place to start to read this author, or to keep returning for his keen insights into the heart and nature of the Southerners he created from the Southerners he knew.  There are thirteen stories here and they include one of Faulkner's most famous, &quot;A Rose For Emily&quot; a tale of great love and, perhaps, necrophilia.  My personal favorite, depressingly sad though it is, is &quot;Dry September&quot; which tells of the extreme violence not only of small town whites to blacks but of whites to whites.  Every one of these superb stories is a gem, masterfully written.  Most were intended for magazines and so are much more straight forward and &quot;simple&quot; than the novels.<br />My only complaint and it is with Modern Library, is that, except in two cases, we are not told when Faulkner wrote the stories nor when they were published.  Even so, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2002-01-13

Here is a naked, contemporary man with his back to us, walking on the bottom of the ocean (pool?  lake?) gripping his clothes with both hands which drag along the floor, being watched over (protected?) by an ancient Greek bust, the head of which is approximately half the size of the man.  Another image shows us two men from another century dueling in full fencing costume, while two contemporary men, under water, fight (embrace?) between the fencers.  A third shows a contemporary, slender man, again under water, fully dressed in jacket, shirt, tie, etc. walking on the bottom of the ocean, using his hands and arms to cover himself, to hide himself, to protect himself, while the ancient, heavily muscled statue near him revels in its nudity and vulnerability.  But it is obvious that the photographs must be seen to be enjoyed and no description of mine can do them justice.<br />These are extraordinarily sensual, if not sexual, photographs which demand viewing by anyone interested in cutting edge art.

So when I was given &quot;Gowns By Adrian&quot; as a gift, I thought I'd flip through it casually and never look at it again.  On the contrary, this is a book to treasure not just for its abundance of photographs (both black &amp; white and color) but, more importantly, for its generously detailed description of MGM, the Hollywood studio system, itself, and how a man of genius, taste, dedication, discipline and talent fit into that system.<br />Howard Gutner's research must have taken him years and years, never mind the compiling and editing of that research.  And it is all worth it.  &quot;Gowns By Adrian&quot; takes us from Gilbert Adrian's first days at MGM, in 1928, when he replaced no less an artist that Erte, to 1941 when Adrian left MGM to open his own shop.<br />During those years, the designer created clothes for some of the most famous movies ever released and most of the famous movie stars who appeared in them:  Norma Shearer as 'Marie Antoinette' and 'Juliet,' Joan Crawford as 'Flaemmchen' in &quot;Grand Hotel,&quot; Jean Harlow as 'Kitty' in &quot;Dinner At Eight,&quot; Katherine Hepburn as 'Tracy Lord' in &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; and Greta Garbo in everything she did for MGM from 1929 until she left in 1941 from &quot;Anna Christie&quot; to &quot;Ninotchka&quot; to &quot;Two Faced Woman&quot; and &quot;Anna Karenina.&quot;  Adrian's legacy to fashion for the average woman?  A dress he designed for Joan Crawford in &quot;Letty Lynton&quot; was &quot;knocked off&quot; and sold 500,000 copies nation-wide.  What makes this statement even more unusual is the fact that not that many people actually saw the film:  &quot;Letty Lynton&quot; was pulled from theatres only a few months after its release because its writers were accused of plagerism.<br />The photographs included in this magnificently produced book are not limited to production stills.  There are sketches, casual snapshops and the inevitable publicity pictures.  My personal favorite is one of Adrian, himself, visiting the set of &quot;Camille&quot; in order to give Garbo a birthday gift.  The designer stands with his back to the camera with his hands behind his back like a shy schoolboy while the great star in one of her beautiful costumes opens a jewelry box with obvious delight.<br />Gutner makes it very clear from his first example to his last that Adrian was not just a terrific dress designer.  Here was a man who understood what the character as written on paper needed to be translated into visual terms for the screen.  Take a look at &quot;The Women&quot; and you'll see everyone of those 135 characters defined, not only by the director and the actresses, but by Adrian's clothes.<br />One of the last paragraphs in the book tells the whole story:  &quot;My mother always told me,&quot; Robin Adrian says, &quot;that when my father left Metro, the studio had to hire five different designers to replace him.&quot;  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2001-12-26

If you want proof, read &quot;The Weekend&quot; or his fantasia on love life in New York City called &quot;Leap Year.&quot;  The short stories collected in &quot;The Half You Don't Know&quot; are the first stories of his that I've read.  And now I plan to buy his other two collections.  What a wonderful writer.  His characters are so full and rich, even when Cameron tells you very little about them.  He is especially good with young people like the boy in 'Homework' whose dog, Keds, &quot;got smashed by some kid pushing a shopping cart;&quot; or Julie in 'Fear of Math' who begins a casual affair with her summer school calculus professor in order to pass the course; or Mark in 'What Do People Do All Day' who brags that his monogram is MTV, or Patrick in 'Fast Forward' who agrees to accompany his friend, Alison, to Maine where Patrick will pretend to be her fiance, so that, supposedly, Alison's mother can die happily.<br />Comparisons are odious, but I have not found so much delight in discovering a writer since I first read the stories and novels of David Leavitt.  Cameron and Leavitt are not at all alike in their writing styles but they both do have such a warm, loving compassion for all of their characters, especially the ones who do not know how to solve their problems, but nevertheless, keep trying to find a way out.<br />I especially treasure a story called 'Slowly' in which a young widow and her late groom's brother try to move on with their lives, to comfort one another and to complete the grieving process.<br />Cameron always leaves the 'half you don't know' as a mystery.  He refuses to fill in all the blanks with his characters.  They are our relatives and friends.  They are us.  We laugh with them and when they are in trouble, as they often are, we empathize greatly with them.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2001-12-25

James crime novel I've read.  It is absolutely one of the finest crime novels I've read by any author.  It is also one of the finest novels (crime or not) I've read this year.<br />The plot keeps us guessing through a wild ride of surprises that do not stop, not even in the final pages.  James' characters are always fully and well drawn, but here she really outdoes herself.  From the title character, Cordelia Gray, the sole owner (against her will) of a detective agency, to every suspect, to the police superintendent (James' already famous Adam Dalgliesh) to those &quot;minor&quot; characters who help Gray &quot;solve&quot; (if &quot;solve&quot; is the correct word) this heinous crime and who appear in only one chapter.  They are all human beings, complicated and not easily categorized, nor judged.  Even the &quot;well brought-up gentleman,&quot; Mark Callender, whose suicide Gray is hired to investigate, is as complex a character you'll find in any work of modern fiction, although we never really meet him since he is dead weeks before the novel begins.<br />Gray's empathy with people in trouble, her desire to do right by her client and by the dead man with whom she has no previous history, her knowledge of what is good &amp; moral and what is not all combine to make her a fascinating protagonist.  And sadly, very much like the detective Dana Andrews played in the brilliant film noir, &quot;Laura,&quot; Gray falls in love with the man whose death she is looking into.  I want very much to read the other novels of James in which she appears.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2001-12-22

The categories contain images by famous artists:  David Hockney, John Dugdale, Christopher Makos, Nan Goldin, Duane Michaels, et al. mixed with those of artists who are not so well known, my personal favorites being David Halliday and Greg Bruce.<br />Leddick's opening essay (which could very easily be much longer and more detailed) explains what artists in the past had to put up with if their art contained even a hint of male eroticism.  Times have obviously changed and this book is proof of that fact.<br />My one criticism, and it is a major one, is that the author insists on &quot;gilding the lily.&quot;  All of his examples speak best by being viewed.  Besides biographical material which is to my mind vital, Leddick's extraneous editorial comments often border on the precious and are always unnecessary  i.e. &quot;Jack Slomovits photographs men who seem to be lost in their own erotic fantasy world...,&quot; &quot;It's hard to imagine how he (Stewart Shining)finds time for his artistic pursuits between meetings with fashion editors, shoots in Florida and bookings in his studio...,&quot; &quot;Rankin is very much a rebel with a cause....&quot;<BR>My advice:  Look at the countless, first rate examples in the book and then contact the artists or their representatives as listed in the index to learn more about them.	2001-12-09

Several of the dedicatees lived the lives of celebrities:  the poet James Merrill, the film makers Derek Jarman and Howard Brookner, the writer Paul Monette.  But it is not their fame which is celebrated in this book:  it is their love and friendship and, most importantly, their art which is now lost to the world forever because of a disease, the deadly power of which, was and still is, underestimated.  The styles of the stories are as diverse as the styles of the individual writers:  some read like the poetry they are; some like straight-forward fiction and some like excruciatingly honest, almost farcical diary entries.<br />These are not simply sad stories; they are beautifully written, funny, charming, intelligent, very candid rememberances of lives past passed.  Besides the stories, there are some photographs of the artists and their works, biographies of the writers and their subjects, a wonderful photograph by John Dugdale on the cover and an introduction by Edmund White<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2001-12-05

Unfortunately, he died before he could write the second and third acts.  Stephen Bach has taken up the task of writing that book for Hart and he does it wonderfully--if, perhaps, a little more openly and honestly than Hart might have liked.<br />A successful, leading playwright on Broadway when still in his twenties, Hart could never really reconcile himself to his humble origins nor to his family members, including his parents, who never quite &quot;got&quot; what their son needed or wanted or deserved and who never really found out how to live comfortably in his own skin with decades of huge successes.<br />Mood swings of manic depression plagued him his entire life as did his confusion over his own sexual identity.  He was also a man who could quite easily and conveniently &quot;forget&quot; some of those friends who had helped him when he was struggling, professionally and personally.  Bach does not write a gossipy tell-all, but lets his readers know that Hart's life was not as sublime as it must have seemed by outsiders.<br />The book is filled with myriad examples of what Broadway and Hollywood was like in the first half of the last century:  why plays like ONCE IN A LIFETIME were hits and why others like LIGHT UP THE SKY were not.  Why Hart's sense of timing most always seemed to serve him well:  i.e. YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU coming at just the right time for a celebration of the individuality and originality of the American spirit.  Celebrity after celebrity worked with Hart:  George S. Kaufman, of course, and Irving Berlin, Cole Porter and Lerner &amp; Loewe, Julie Andrews and Rex Harrison, George M. Cohan and Richard Rodgers, Judy Garland and Richard Burton.  The list is endless. <br />Bach writes imaginatively and with suchgreat wit and force and strength that the reader is swept up in Hart's life, living it as fast and furiously as he must have.  It is un-put-downable.<BR>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, especially for anyone with an interest in legitimate theatre as an art.	2001-11-25

James is worth reading, but UNNATURAL CAUSES is simply not one of her best.  Yes, the plot is fascinating, if a bit dependent on twists and turns that mean very little, indeed, to the solution of the murders.<br />Most interesting, as usual with James, is her development of complex characters.  Unfortunately, as another reviewer pointed out, almost every one of these characters is, at best, unpleasant and since they are all writers or are connected with professional writers in some way, it seems James has a bit of a chip on her shoulder about her colleagues.<br />The last 20 pages contain a transcription of a taped confession which ties up all the loose plot knots, but does not, at all, let us in on the effects this confession has on any of the characters except for James' detective, Adam Dalgliesh.  This is truly disappointing, especially for a writer who so carefully peoples her novels.<br />A small note:  I do not consider myself a prude and perhaps it is mere political correctness on my part, but I found James' characters' negative comments about homosexuals and  one physically challenged character to be in poor taste.	2001-11-20

You have a bad day at the office or the plant, you have a prickly run-in with a neighbor and when a friend asks how you are, you answer &quot;Oh, I'm so depressed!&quot;<br />In Andrew Solomon's wise and beautifully written self-described &quot;atlas&quot; he explains immediately and interestingly and clearly exactly what depression is and what it is not. The author never shrinks from using himself as his main subject telling personal stories from his own struggles, his successes and his falls. But he also uses scientific and cultural examples to place this illness in its perspective. Other sufferers are interviewed as are doctors and, even philosophers.<br />To be honest, I came to this work of non-fiction because I so loved Solomon's novel A STONE BOAT which covers some of the material in this book. Solomon is an extraordinary writer. <br />I hesitate to give too many specific examples that are covered in the book, because, frankly, I believe many people will say to themselves, &quot;Oh, that sounds like such a downer...I don't need to read such a SAD book.&quot; Well, here's the shocker: THE NOONDAY DEMON is so completely fascinating, so well-written and so intelligent that it is, in Adam Gopnik's (&quot;The New Yorker&quot;) words, &quot;charming, lively...never the least bit depressing.&quot; HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2001-10-21

It is also and, perhaps more importantly, a novel of real love and loss and, interestingly enough, in these times of great tragedy and uncertainty in our country and in the world, it is a novel which teaches us that each day must be lived fully.<br />A simple plot:  a single, lonely, gay American living in Paris meets and falls in love with another lonely, gay man.  To complicate things, the lover is married, nearly half the American's age and claims to be bisexual.  The men flee Paris when the American gets a teaching job in Providence, Rhode Island, and from there they run to Key West, Montreal, Venice and Morocco, in search of anything which could prolong their romance and, indeed, the married man's life.<br />As usual with White, the writing is exquisite.   THE MARRIED MAN is right there on a par with the best of his books which are, to my mind, the AIDS memoir/novel THE FAREWELL SYMPHONY and the wonderful short stories collected in SKINNED ALIVE.  THE MARRIED MAN is heartbreaking and tragic and it is also, at times, very, very funny, almost, indeed, a comedy of gay manners.  It is also at its core a tremendously moving, honest, human love story about two courageous men.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2001-10-21

I happen to simply ENJOY James' work more and DEATH IN HOLY ORDERS is one of her best.  in fact, I'd say it was my favorite, along with her superb INNOCENT BLOOD.<br />The setting and atmosphere are familiar, almost stereotypically so:  a quiet,  wind-swept monastery/theological college high on deserted, bleak cliffs outside of a small, British town (East Anglia).  Add to that some dark, stormy nights, rough ocean waters,  a lonely, windy beach and, of course, a grisly murder.  Read a few chapters before another murder, even more grisly and violent, is committed.   Enter Commander Adam Dalgliesh, James' seemingly emotionless investigator/detective.<br />But it is not just the plot and setting that make a P.D. James novel special.  It is her characters which are always well drawn and in this novel that's saying alot because there are so many of them and each an individual creation with good and bad traits, human beings all...and all suspects:   Several priests, one of whom is an ex-felon; the gentle man who works as handyman to the priests and his sister with whom he has a &quot;more than affectionate&quot; relationship; a few professors who teach the young ordinands and a visiting lecturer, et. al.<br />DEATH IN HOLY ORDERS is a fascinating read from the first page when an already closed murder case is re-opened and investigated to the very fulfilling conclusion which hints at the possibility of a brighter future for Dalgliesh.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2001-10-21

If he is not as well known in the USA as he is in his native England, it is just that his plays have not travelled to Broadway where, I believe, they would be instant &quot;new classics.&quot;<br />DEAD FUNNY is a brilliant dissection of two rotting marriages, friends who come together in the fan club they've created for the British &quot;low&quot; comedians who create laughter by pretending to be silly, sex-starved clowns.  Perhaps the American equivalent would be Rodney Dangerfield, Lou Costello, Red Skelton or today's Adam Sandler...not the brainy, quick-witted stand-ups like Seinfeld or Joy Behar.<br />It's a memorial service for Benny Hill which provides the setting for DEAD FUNNY.  The hosts, Eleanor and Richard, a 30-something husband and wife who have long ago substituted excoriating wit for affection and their friends, Lisa and Nick, who seemingly have a happy, fulfilled family life, joined by their older, buffoonish friend, Brian for an evening of fun and games.<br />This is a terribly funny, sad, bitter, hysterical, shocking play which deserves as big an audience in this country as it had in London during its long and very successful run.

Although I am very happy with the 4 cd set I own of Bing Crosby's songs over a period of 4 decades (&quot;The Legendary Years&quot;)I glanced at the Crosby entries tonight on Amazon.com and there are 204 of them !! That makes perfect sense after you read Gary Giddens' superb, fascinating biography of Bing...a man who knew from the beginning of his career exactly what kind of star he could be. And, interestingly enough, he may have actually underestimated exactly how big a star he'd become.<br />204 entries which include everything from Broadway to gospel to country and western to Hawaiian to Christmas to nutty character stuff. Before I heard the cd's and read this book, I had ignorantly misjudged him:  Bing was no ordinary crooner. He was a super jazz singer who also knew exactly the kind of pop music his audience wanted and knew exactly how to give it to them. He obviously loved singing and he was as adept at improvisation (in his movies, too) as he was a superb technician.<br />This is no kiss-and-tell bio. It is thoroughly researched with so much to tell that this volume ends in 1940 when World War 2 was just about to make Bing a bigger star than he already was.<BR>We learn of his unhappy marriage and his fights to include minorities in all of his work. We learn of his battle with alcoholism and his generosity when a friend, a relative or actually strangers needed emotional or financial support, given many times anonymously.<br />All of the recording sessions are here and his radio performances and all of the movies too. We learn, most fascinatingly, how the characters he played on the radio and in movies were actually, more and more, created to BE Bing: Art imitating Life. That nonchalant, &quot;lazy,&quot; ad-libbing, bon vivant WAS Bing...This was no character. This was the man, himself. Giddens has so much material that he promises a second volume. I can't wait.

This first, by Edmund White, is a winner. <br />White takes us into HIS Paris, a city he has lived in for many, many years. As an American, the city will naturally feel different to him than it might to a native. White's writing is, as always, graceful and beautiful. His assessment of Colette, his desription of &quot;nationalism&quot; among the Jews of Paris, and, certainly, his thoughts on Homosexuality and specifically HIV in this city are important and fascinating. I also especially enjoyed the short appendix on &quot;further reading.&quot; <br />It surprised me that a few of the other reviewers were taken aback that White would spend so much of his time on gay Parisian life. This has always been a subject for White...in his novels, his memoirs and in his non-fiction works. Hire Julia Child to write about Paris and we're bound to get a book filled with thoughts on food. By the way, a &quot;flaneur,&quot; we are told, is a person who walks, strolls for the purpose of walking or strolling...not with any &quot;ulterior&quot; motive. RECOMMENDED	2001-09-09

Well, that book is here.<br />Greg Lawrence's fascinating DANCE WITH DEMONS is so painstakingly researched and so fair-minded, so interestingly written that it speeds along as if it were a novel, that it will, I believe, in years to come, be regarded as a very important document of life in the Theatre and the Ballet from the 1930's to the 1990's.<br />None of Robbins' &quot;psychological problems&quot; are glossed over and none of his matchless successes as a classical choreographer and as a director and choreographer of Broadway mega-hits is given short shrift.<br />Any reader with an interest in life in the New York City Ballet, under George Balanchine and then under Peter Martins, or in the Golden Age of Broadway's Musical Comedies, can afford to miss this book. Years and years of research obviously went into its writing. Just a very few examples of people quoted at length about Robbins, the artist, are his collaborators on WEST SIDE STORY (Arthur Laurents, Leonard Bernstein, Stephen Sondheim, Harold Prince), his collaborator and boss on THE KING AND I (Oscar Hammerstein,2), his dancers on Broadway (Yuriko, Robert La Fosse, Charlotte D'Amboise, Grover Dale, et al) and his dancers in the ballet world (Peter Martins, Suzanne Farrell, Bart Cook, Violette Verdy, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Rudolf Nureyev, et al).  We also get to read what the critics said about the various works when they premiered.<br />What makes the book terrific reading is that time and time again, through the years, we read of no one who has anything negative to say about Robbins, the artist. And yet, over and over we read of peers being crushed, other artists being &quot;named&quot; in the HUAC hearings, friends and lovers being used and abused.<BR>Demons, indeed.<BR>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2001-09-08

A friend loaned it to me and, although I was very busy with other business stuff, I started reading and could not put it down until I finished 10 hours later. It is that compelling. If you want specific plot points, there are lots of reviews here that tell them, but I advise against trying to find out too much about this book before you jump into it. The story revolves around Gabriel Noone a famous novelist and radio personality, as famous as...well, as famous as Armistead Maupin. He is a very complex &quot;hero:&quot; strong, talented, charming, generous and yet very psychologically needy, unable to see that his faults could be as damning as those that he finds in his friends and family. All of the characters, even the ones who appear only briefly, are fully drawn and fascinating, from the author's boyfriend, Jess, searching for his own identity after leaving his Love of ten years, to the author's bookkeeper Anna: smart and funny, charming and terribly devoted to her boss whom she thinks could be going off the deep end. We also meet Noone's Southern racist father whom Maupin makes much more complex than just an easy target for liberals and his stepmother, Darlie, who is an ex-schoolmate of Noone's and only one year apart from him in age. The two major characters besides Noone, who tells the story, are a terminally ill 13 year old boy, Pete, and his adoptive mother, Donna. How they figure into Noone's life and how they change his life is what makes the novel so very moving. They are strangers to him and yet make him re-think each and every one of his major relationships. There are surprises, literally, in every chapter--strange twists that one could not possibly see coming: the style of the novel, itself, changes from a kind of roman a clef to a gothic thriller worthy of a Stephen King and back again. Early in the book, an editor/acquaintance of Noone's describes Pete's writing with &quot;He'd use a ten-dollar word when a ten-cent one would do.&quot; Unfortunately, I find this to be true of Maupin. There were many times in this otherwise first rate novel that I'd have preferred not to be manipulated with &quot;ten-dollar words.&quot; Also, although I understand the shock on the very last page, it left me unsatisfied. All in all, though, this is a wonderful book which deserves as wide an audience as possible. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2001-08-26

PLEASE write another novel as soon as possible. I have never come across Solomon's prose in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and have not read his two non-fiction books, one about artists in the Soviet Union and one about Depression. A STONE BOAT is his first novel. It was a birthday gift to me and I read it in three days. I then waited one day and read it all over again. It is one of the most elegantly written novels I've ever read: Solomon chooses words as if they were precious jewels and then sets them perfectly. And yet, the reader is never conscious of the author, as Armistead Maupin says, &quot;using a ten dollar word when a ten cent word will do.&quot; A STONE BOAT tells of a gifted classical pianist, Harry, at the beginning of what will no doubt be a major career. An American living in London, Harry joins his privileged family for what is supposed to be a joyous holiday in France. But it is here that they learn that Harry's mother has cancer. This tragedy is the centerpiece of the narrative, but it is the lives that touch Harry's and his mother's that make the book even more fascinating and complex, funny, charming and, above all, achingly beautiful. The novel is not packed with scores of characters. Rather it is an intimate story of a family and the few who are their satellites: from Harry's good-hearted, passive, British male lover to his wise and strong American girlfriend, from his unforgiving, tough-minded agent to his hedonistic sex partner, Nick. It is, in the end, a story of life conquering death, of a family bonding at first to refuse Death admittance to their home and then, finally, conspiring to help one of their own die, in her own way and time by her own hand with dignity and grace. This is a once-in-a-lifetime read: a novel to cherish. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2001-08-25

Divided, as it is, into the categories of &quot;Who, When, Where &amp; What,&quot; the reader can easily find the principal photographers from 1839 til today (&quot;Who&quot;), the moment of greatest significance for a particular style or method of photography (&quot;When&quot;), the cities, countries and continents in which a movement was centered (&quot;Where&quot;) and the nature and origins of the style or technique (What&quot;).<br />For example, we learn that &quot;collage&quot; which had long been used in decorative arts, was actually first used in fine art when Picasso pasted oilcloth onto his 1912 painting &quot;Still Life With Chair Caning.&quot;  We learn a useful, simple definition of collage and how some modernist painters/photographers have used it including David Hockney and Robert Frank in the 1980's.  We learn that in 1854, a man named Andre-Adolphe-Eugene Disderi patented something called a &quot;carte-de-visite&quot; which is a portrait glued to a piece of cardboard the size of a traditional visiting card....like the ones forever being left on hallway trays in the novels of Edith Wharton and Henry James.<br />There also terms and phrases we might have heard but, perhaps, did not understand fully like &quot;contact sheet&quot; or &quot;daguerreotype,&quot; &quot;The New York School&quot; or &quot;Photojournalism&quot; and &quot;Camera Obscura&quot; to name just a few.<br />The book is crammed full of wonderful bits and pieces of information, interestingly written and invaluable for the photographer, the photography collector or the hobbyist.

Paul Padgette writes a wonderful, lengthy introduction, especially fine for someone, like me, who knows nothing about Van Vechten:  dance critic, novelist and photographer.<br />Padgette selected the 200 photographs in the book from the 5,000 left to the Dance Collection at Lincoln Center.  If, as we are told, Van Vechten was &quot;amazingly creative,&quot; it will have to be proved in a volume which reproduces his photographs more carefully.   Van Vechten, evidentally, chose to remain an amateur photographer, although he got most of the famous stars to sit for him:  from Martha Graham to Alecia Markova, from a nine year old Balinese dancer to Josephine Baker, but....(and it is a large &quot;but&quot;)  the photographs have been reproduced so poorly that they, indeed, look amateurish, poorly lit, grainy.  <br />I own two of Van Vechten's photographs.  One is of a scene from the ballet, &quot;Afternoon of a Faun&quot; and the second is of a very young, very handsome Marlon Brando.  They look anything but amateurish.	2001-08-13

Brassai was, no doubt about it, one of the handful of great photographers who worked from 1900 til midpoint in the last century.  He tells us that in Paris, he had &quot;an unquenchable thirst for knowledge.&quot;   Although he did many portraits of the famous like fellow photographer, Andre Kertesz, and exiled president of Hungary, Mihaly Karolyi, and Picasso and the composer, Edgard Varese (reproductions of which are included in this beautifully produced book) and the instantly recognizable monuments and even the graffiti of the city, he was even more well known for his images of the seamier side of Paris-- (known in the USA as &quot;Paris Secrets&quot;)  the night life which not only included actors and dancers, but also prostitutes and transvestites.  (he actually became so well-known and liked in the bordellos, that he was allowed &quot;free-reign&quot; to photograph the women and their clients!)<br />A Hungarian by birth, he obviously loved all aspects of Paris.  This is not only obvious in his art, but also in his writing.  From 1920 til 1940, Brassai (born Gyula Halasz in 1899) kept up an almost religiously regular correspondence with his parents.  These letters, some like diary entries, show his great affection for his family and home, but also for this extraordinary city in which he chose to live and work.<br />If you are at all interested in how a great artist finds inspiration and how he continues to grow from day to day, from triumph to triumph and indeed from struggle and disappointment to more struggle and even more disappoinment, these letters will thrill you.  I have always been fascinated by Brassai (I own one of his images) and have never been able to find a satisfying biography that tells anything of his early life and history.  Well, here is that book and it is in his own words and illustrated with several of his fine photographs.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2001-08-07

He tells his subject that he looks like &quot;a thug...if I could paint you as I see you and a policeman saw the picture he'd arrest you immediately!&quot;  And then, &quot;Don't laugh.  I'm not supposed to make my models laugh.&quot;  He tells the author of his trip to London's National Gallery where he says, &quot;...I deliberately didn't look at the Rembrandts, because if I had looked at them I wouldn't have been able to look at anything else afterward.&quot; Later on in his work, &quot;It's impossible to paint a portrait...the photograph exists and that's all there is to it.&quot;<br />Giacometti was not only one of the greatest artists of the last century he was also, obviously, a wonderful, contradictory, clever, intelligent, verbal, loving, open, warm companion.  When the painting is not going well, the artist exclaims, &quot;If only Cezanne were here, he would set everything right with two brush strokes.&quot;  Lord gently corrects him pointing out that Cezanne had plenty of trouble.  And then Giacometti (probably with a hint of happiness) agrees, &quot;Even he had trouble.&quot;<br />One comes to know these two men so well in this small, beautifully written memoir that one feels close to them and to their emotional upset when after only eighteen days, they part ways.  The author reminds us that Giacometti would be the first to remark that a portrait could only achieve a &quot;semblence of reality.&quot;  He hopes that the artist will enjoy this written portrait.  As Lord writes, &quot;To see even so little will be to see very much.&quot;  True.<br />Included in the paperback are snapshots taken to show Lord's portrait in progress.

I have also had the great pleasure and privilege of studying for four years with Uta in the school she helped create with her late husband, Herbert Berghof (the famous HB Studio in New York City).  I can assure you that she is one of the finest teachers of our time.  It is a very rare actor who can actually communicate as a fine teacher.  Uta is one of those very few who do just that.<br />In this, her first book, she lays out a &quot;blueprint&quot; for actors which, as surely as a blueprint by an architect, can be followed by those actors who are novices or those who have great experience.  No, she cannot give you talent, but she can (and does) show you the how and why to use your talent to serve the playwright.<br />She believes in acting as an Art and this &quot;how-to book&quot; is invested with the love and respect of its title.

In this superb book of Dugdale's photographs and selections from Thoreau's journals, it is as if the writings were done specifically for the images, not over 100 years previously.<br />Dugdale has, for many years, been one of my favorite photographers.  He uses a process for printing his photographs called cyanotype which was invented during the time that Thoreau lived and worked.  The wonderful elegance and simplicity of his subjects and images fits perfectly with Thoreau's philosophies of life.  Dugdale, because of HIV, is 80% blind, but, somehow, uses what sight he has combined with a pure spirituality and sight beyond the physical to create images of rare beauty.<br />So, we see a single rose alongside these words of Thoreau:  &quot;Love is the burden of all Nature's odes...&quot;  A still-life of flowers, two birds, which may be made of milk glass, and a human hand are viewed with Thoreau's &quot;Perhaps what most moves us in winter is some reminiscence of far-off summer...;&quot; a solitary man with one hand against an old, tall tree by a pond and a field are perfect for Thoreau's &quot;Live in each season as it passes; breathe the air, drink the drink, taste the fruit, and resign yourself to the influences of each...&quot;  And perhaps most moving of all, part of the back of a nude man is used with Thoreau's &quot;My life was ecstasy.  In youth, before I lost any of my senses, I can remember that I was all alive, and inhabited my body with inexpressible satisfaction...&quot;<br />The book begins with two short, wonderfully written appreciations of the artists by Frank Crocitto.<br />This collection is magnificent beyond any contemporary words.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2001-07-07

Imagine, before vocal amplification, seeing a musical in a theatre with only 299 seats!  And Henry Miller's Theatre which does still stand on West 43 Street.  It housed musicals, plays and then to keep the doors open, it showed movies, then adult movies and was, most recently, reinvented as a nightclub.  Or, Hammerstein's Theatre on Broadway and 53rd Street which was a home to plays, musicals and the Federal Theatre Project WPA, long before it became the studio for Dave Letterman's television show. The pictures show us, also, how the streets looked in those days--what was playing at the theatres and how people dressed, how the cars looked that they drove.  <br />Those are just a few of the facts one can find in this fascinating, informative, entertaining book.	2001-07-07

If you are familiar only with Siskind's abstract photographs, these will come as something of a shock.  They are beautiful, simple, elegant and filled to bursting with the pride of the people who are the subjects of Siskind's work.<br />The book contains images from three separate photo projects that Siskind undertook in the 30's for The New York Photo League.  They were collected and exhibited by the Smithsonian (National Museum of American Art) in Washington, D.C. in 1991.<br />The beautifully written (almost poetic) foreword is by artist/photographer/film maker/writer/etc. Gordon Parks and is worth the cost of the book alone.  There is also a well-written introduction to the photographer and his work by Marcia Battle and, most impressive is an oral history of eight of the people Siskind was immortalizing, done for the Federal Writers Project, worthy of Studs Terkel.<br />But it's the photographs that will stay with you:  a nattily dressed old man, obviously a performer, waiting backstage for his cue to go on; a young girl, sitting on a milk can instead of a chair, eating a meal with her young mom in their kitchen under the freshly washed laundry which has been hung to dry; Jones Barber Shop (Haircut: 25 cents)comfortably sharing a brownstone on West 132nd Street with the Young Students Interdenominational Minister's Alliance right next door to May's And Johnson's Beauty School; a nude, black dancer performing for white patrons only; the proud owner of Our Own Community Grocery and Delicatessen (Milk 6 cents, Bacon 10 cents) posing in the sun in front of his shop.  Every image takes us back to a specific time with very specific people.

Wilson's work with frequent collaborator, Philip Glass (i.e. EINSTEIN ON THE BEACH), his beginnings (DEAFMAN GLANCE at the Festival of Nancy, France), his work with celebrities (Jessye Norman in GREAT DAY IN THE MORNING at the Theatre des Champs Elysses), work in the U.S. (i.e. KNEE PLAYS with a score by David Byrne),standard opera productions (i.e. SALOME at La Scala) are all given their due in this lengthy, gorgeously designed volume.<br />Besides the essays and photographs (color and black &amp; white) there is a complete chronology of Wilson's works up to and including his production of Stravinsky's OEDIPUS REX paired with Bartok's BLUEBEARD'S CASTLE for Opera Zurich, TIME ROCKER by Lou Reed in Hamburg and Virgil Thompson's FOUR SAINTS IN THREE ACTS for the Edinburgh Festival, all in 1996.  Theatre, film, video, solo exhibitions, museum installations, awards and selected publications are all listed with complete descriptions and vital facts. For anyone interested in where World Theatre has been and where it is going, this book is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2001-07-02

However, the photographs and reproductions are first rate:  We'll unfortunately never again see the beauty of the Art Deco design for the Court Cafe in Albuquerque, New Mexico or the main dining room/gas station and smaller cottages that made up the Dutch Mill Village of South Glasgow, Kentucky---They were all shaped like perfect, tiny windmills.  Where but at Hick's Drive In on the Dixie Highway in Louisville, Kentucky would you find a circular building, a horseshoe shaped counter and an interior constructed entirely of glass?  <br />My personal favorite postcard is of the Victory Cafe in Mattoon, Illinois--not that it is the most glamorous, but simply because it reminds me of my childhood, Saturday lunches at Baumgart's in Hackensack, New Jersey.<br />When/If you go antiquing, do you wander over to the bins of yellowing postcards?

Divided into three distinct sections:  Siena, Lucca and Florence, this is definitely not a book for getting &quot;how to&quot; tips on gardening in the U.S.A.  These so-called gardens are perfect for imagination day dreams or movie settings.  These are not your marigold and petunia gardens.  Instead you will be transported to another time and another place where semi-circular pools, hillside terraces, lime and ilez shade trees, sunflower fields and espaliered vines share space with secret gardens of peach, olive and magnolia trees underplanted with crocuses, daffodills, irises, lilies and roses or box-edged flower gardens, bowling greens and fountains.<br />Each wonderful photograph is fully explained as to where it is and how it relates to the buildings which share the acreage and to the families who own the villas.<br />Not one of those cumbersome, oversized books, it is easily held and easily read.  Historian, Sir Harold Acton, has written a lovely introduction and one feature that I found fascinating was a listing of the public gardens in the book, since most of the Tuscan gardens are, naturally, private.  Recommended.	2001-06-15

White as a child although all of my friends were very much into \\"Charlotte's Web\\" and \\"The Trumpet of the Swan.\\"  Perhaps it was because the only other Stuart I'd ever heard of was White's mouse/hero with the last name Little...a fact that my schoolmates teased me with throughout grade school.<br />....<br />White has got to be one of the finest writers I've ever read, expressing in 5 graceful words what it takes others paragraphs to do.  His descriptions of life in Maine are priceless for anyone, like me, who has longed to let the country boy deep down inside sit back and \\"smell the roses.\\"  And,of course, Maine is still one of the few places in the U.S. that is relatively city poison-free.<br />Read White's opening sentence in his brilliant \\"Here Is New York\\" which is, arguably, the best appreciation of this all-too-crazy city:  \\"On any person who desires such queer prizes, New York will bestow the gift of loneliness and the gift of privacy.\\" Where did he write those words?  \\"...in a stifling hotel room in 90-degree heat, halfway down an air shaft, in midtown.\\"  At the end of this wonderful, wonderful essay (which, by the way has been re-printed, all by itself, in a beautifully illustrated paperback) White contemplates an old Willow tree in the Turtle Bay area and he writes, \\"This must be saved,this particular thing, this very tree.  If it were to go, all would go--this city, this mischievous and marvelous monument which not to look upon would be like death.\\"<br />What other essayist expresses his thoughts and ours so unself-consciously, so economically and, yes, so magnificently?  None that I have come across.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2001-06-09

Although I've happily been to Italy several times, I had no idea where Maremma is.  The answer, as evidenced by the book's subtitle, is Southern Tuscany--an area, according to the authors, that is hardly a tourist Mecca.<br />The book not only explains why two gay lovers would move here & why they'd buy a house that under the best of circumstances would be called a \\"fixer-upper,\\"  it also introduces the reader to marvelous characters, or rather marvelous people, for they're all real:  Magini the cabinetmaker & Pina, the chef at Il Mulino & Pepe, the iron-fitter & Olimpia Orsini, the interior designer, are just a few of my favorites out of the dozens in the book.<br />We spend a happy/bittersweet Christmas with Leavitt & Mitchell; we go with them when they apply for drivers' licenses from corrupt officials; we share countless Tuscan meals with them and their generous neighbors and their neighbors' children; we watch them (snake-haters, both) kill a dangerous asp and, finally, we begin to understand why these two American writers live and flourish here...why and how they have, in their words, \\"become Italian.\\"<br />One small touch that I found very charming was the way the authors explain situations with specific terms in English and then, parenthetically, in Italian; another is the inclusion of selections from Mitchell's diary when the men were only visitors to Italy. It is also very gratifying that the [lifestyle] of the authors is never an issue.  They are obviously accepted as writers, as Americans, as men, as human beings.  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2001-05-27

Scott; Larry Gelbart writing about being in New Haven (and in trouble) with the original production of &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way To the Forum&quot; and Uta Hagen co-starring with Paul Robeson in &quot;Othello&quot; while facing segregation &amp; racism in almost every city to which she toured.  <br />Serious and charming, funny and sad in turns, the book is absolutely essential reading for anyone who wants to make a career in theatre or simply is delighted by this profession and art.  Not just performers are represented, but costumers, wig makers, stage managers, casting directors, conductors, etc.  The people included are the cream of the crop.  And they are willing to share sometimes intimate--always entertaining stories of their lives and profession.	2001-05-23

(Not, as far as I could tell, \\"ravaged\\" as another reader has written.)   <br />This is a stunning book of wonderful artworks, many of which are uncollected elsewhere.  The photographs are mostly by the great George Platt Lynes, a photographer whose use of lighting and subject matter were not only dramatic but also, at times, shocking and certainly historically innovative.  Here is an artist whose life and work were cut short by cancer but who is now, finally, decades after his death, finding the fame that he deserved when he lived.<br />Some of the models in the book are artists themselves:  Paul Cadmus, George Tooker, Horst, etc.  There are also photos of Tennessee Williams, Jean Marais and Yul Brynner.   One shocking photograph is of W. Somerset Maugham, a man who throughout his entire life was \\"closeted,\\" but for whatever reason allowed Lynes to photograph him admiring a naked man.<br />In the author's words, these men \\"paved the way for male sexual liberation\\"....by \\"shattering taboos.\\"  He definitely makes his point.  I only wish there were more works of art in the book and that the description and stories of the models' lives after the photographs were more lengthy and detailed.	2001-05-16

I literally could not put it down and finished it 6 hours later, at 5:00 a.m.  It is, quite simply, one of the most moving, beautifully and tenderly and honestly written memoirs I've read in years.<br />How does one describe a true, deep friendship?  What makes it work and what makes it fall apart from time to time?  London-1980:  Callow, thirty years old (an actor at the beginning of an impressive career) met possibly the most important influence in his life: the seventy year old Margaret (Peggy) Ramsay, the internationally known, respected, feared and beloved theatrical agent.<br />What follows are the special fireworks of their loving friendship until Ramsay's painful, ugly, difficult death from cancer.<br />A knowledge and/or love of contemporary British theatre could only add to your enjoyment of this book, but anyone who has lived through an impossible love or friendship with a larger-than-life partner; anyone who has known and lost true love; anyone who enjoys reading beautifully fashioned prose--will treasure this book.<br />I, frankly, do not understand the reviewers below who feel that Callow shamefully &quot;uses&quot; Ramsay in this tribute to her and their relationship.  Isn't that what lovers and dear friends do?  Don't we all use each other?  And get used by our partners?  Not USED UP, mind you.  But &quot;used&quot; in the best sense.

It is there that I've spent many happy hours looking through new and used books and maps- some treasures and some highly disposable.<br />One of the favorite places I've ever visited is Rome, Italy.  And this book by H. V. Morton which is shamefully out of print, is positively the finest I've read on this forever changing, &quot;eternal&quot; city.<br />I'd never heard of Morton, but soon learned that in 1957, when this volume was published, he was &quot;the most widely read living travel author.&quot;  And now, according to research I've done online, every single one of his books is out of print.  And he wrote quite a few:  &quot;A Stranger In Spain,&quot; &quot;In Search Of London,&quot; &quot;In The Steps Of St. Paul,&quot; et. al.  Morton's method is simple and works perfectly:  first a short history of Rome, then a diary-like collection of his thoughts and impressions.  There are also several, wonderful photographs including a charming, color one of The Vatican's Swiss Guard---one man &quot;at attention;&quot; the other looking as if he had better things to do.  Everything in the book is well-researched and very interestingly written, yet his description of the politics and history of The Vatican is especially fascinating, as is his description of Julius Caesar's final days.  But the book is not all history.  Not at all.  We also read about the author's trip to an open market, Hadrian's Villa, and I particularly liked the passage about Rome in the rain, since when I was there, it rained every single day for twenty days.  This is a book of fact that reads like a fine novel.<br />It is an absolute crime that Morton's books cannot be more easily purchased both for travellers and for people whose hobby is reading about travel.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2001-05-15

This is a definite find:  a must-own, must-read for anyone interested in the history and art of Photography.<br />Newhall was the first curator of the Department of Photography in New York City's Museum of Modern Art and, finally, the founding curator at the International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House in Rochester, N.Y.  <br />This book is a wonderful, charming, fact-filled, incident-filled volume of a life dedicated to creating an Art form, chock full of fascinating reminiscences of the likes of Ansel Adams, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Edward Weston, Walker Evans and so many others...certainly every important name in Photography during Newhall's lifetime.  It is beautifully, gracefully, wittily written and includes letters, diary entries and many, many black &amp; white photographs--some of them personal &quot;snapshots.&quot;<br />Through my own ignorance, I had no idea who Newhall was before I picked up the book (I bought it simply because of the subtitle:  &quot;Memoirs of a Life in Photography&quot;) and now, because of Newhall's intimate writing style, I feel I &quot;know&quot; a very important adventurer and force in the 20th century art world.	2001-05-09

Tynan wrote so beautifully and wittily and lovingly about the stage and the people who inhabit it and he was also responsible in a major way for the success of the National Theatre of Great Britain along with his friend and professional partner, Laurence Olivier.  (an essay on Olivier is one of the high-points of this book.)  It was Tynan who &quot;discovered&quot; Harold Pinter, who &quot;made the career&quot; of John Osbourne and was a major factor in reviving the career of Noel Coward, after years of neglect:  as Literary Manager of the National, it was Tynan who urged a revival of Coward's classic &quot;Hay Fever.&quot;<br />This collection of 50 essays is absolutely essential reading for anyone who has a love of theatre or simply of celebrity and star power.  No one writing today writes as well as Tynan did nor consistently shows his affection for Show Business.  If you regularly read today's so-called critics, you come away with the feeling that they become INSULTED that plays they dislike were actually produced!<br />I highly recommend this book.  It is passionate, charming and, at times, really funny stuff.  But, please, do yourself a favor and haunt every used book shop you know to find a copy of Tynan's out-of-print collected theatre reviews from the U.S. (he wrote for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;) and England called CURTAINS.  It is absolutely the best book of criticism you'll ever read.	2001-05-01

This is a delightful, much-too-brief book, worthwhile if only for its appreciation of performers from Jack Benny to Whoopie Goldberg.<br />One of the other on-line reviewers has called this book the &quot;worst kind of popular pulp fiction trash.&quot;  And it very well might be, were it not for the fact that it is TRUTH, NOT FICTION.	2001-04-29

He is almost single-handedly responsible for A&amp;F's remarkable success.

Obviously, since the book is not hard-covered, it is difficult to keep perfectly.  But maybe that's the point.

Gorman is a contemporary photographer obviously enamored of his subjects.  The care and dignity he bestoys on all his models in this book is exemplary.  <br />A previous collection, published by Rizzoli, is called &quot;Inside Life&quot; and consists mainly of portraits of celebrities from Brando to Sarandon, from Quincy Jones to Leonardo Di Caprio before he was LEONARD DI CAPRIO-from a cross-dressing Sharon Stone to a nude Keanu Reeves.  But these are much more than publicity pictures one might see in a magazine like &quot;Vanity Fair;&quot; they really bear repeated viewings:  has any of us seen Sugar Ray Leonard looking so troubled?;  How clever to let us watch Savion Glover resting his feet, rather than tapping;  How witty to show us gay porn icon, Jeff Stryker, as he might have looked in an MGM 1940's studio shot.<br />As beautifully put together as the above volume is, Gorman's &quot;As I See It&quot; is even better.  Powerhouse Books has given Gorman the publication he deserves.  This is a magnificently designed and executed collection of classic male nudes, most of whom are posed in neutral surroundings, so that our eyes go to the male form and how this photographer wants us to see it.<br />Included is a reproduction of a charming, hand-written note to Gorman from his fan (and sometimes model) Elton John.  A wonderful book of beautiful images.  Highly recommended.	2001-04-22

But, perhaps, a book written by someone interested in the man's flaws as well as his accomplishments, his failures as well as his triumphs, might have been better reading.  Cristine Conrad says in her author's note that she was Robbins' friend for more than 30 years.  To my way of thinking, her friendship gets in the way of good reporting.  I'm not necessarily looking for a hatchet job on Robbins, but a writer less interested in (what we used to call) brown-nosing, would, most likely, have written a richer book.<br />Why did I give it even four stars?  The huge, varied collection of photographs in this book is fascinating and invaluable for anyone interested in Musical Theatre or 20th Century American Ballet.<br />The real, full version of Robbins' life is yet to be written/published.	2001-04-21

And if this charming, funny, little sampler (chock full of rhymes and quotes and line drawings) will help, then I'm all for it.<br />But, most of Coward's quotes in Day's book are taken out of context from plays and films.  And what usually makes most of them laugh-out-loud funny or just smilingly clever is that very context:  what and how and why Coward's characters say what they say.<br />Also alot of his references are very, very British and relatively antique like this short speech from &quot;Private Lives,&quot; one of his best and most frequently revived plays: (Amanda):  &quot;And India, the burning Ghars, or Ghats, or whatever they are, and the Taj Mahal.  How was the Taj Mahal?...And it didn't look like a biscuit box, did it?  I've always felt that it might.&quot; That passage (quoted in its entirety from this volume) is simply not really funny, unless the reader knows the play and the character of 'Amanda' or is watching the play and hears the actress playing 'Amanda' speak the lines.<br />But then there are always his wonderful, romantic lyrics, usually tinged with sadness when they are not downright playful: &quot;I'll see you again,/Whenever spring breaks through again;/Time may lie heavy between,/But what has been/Is past forgetting.&quot;<br />And wonderful, pithy lines that have to do as much with today (think:  American politics) as they do with the period in which they were written: &quot;It's discouraging to think how many people are shocked by honesty and how few by deceit.&quot;<br />If this book is a jumping-off place for people to really dig in and investigate Coward more thoroughly, then I recommend it.  Better yet, read his plays like the above mentioned &quot;Private Lives&quot; and &quot;Hay Fever&quot; and &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; to begin with, and then some of his short stories and his vastly under-rated Diaries.	2001-04-17

This book is NOT one of those volumes filled with 1-4 stars which rate each movie and let us know which is available on DVD.  It is also NOT one of those volumes written by a cheesy, so-called critic who, simply because he's got good hair, is allowed to put thumbs up or down on movies and plays for your local tv station.<br />What IS it?  It is the 9th edition of a 1500+ page, soft-covered film guide written by more than 200 British film critics.  <br />&quot;Time Out,&quot; itself, is the best guide to what's playing and what's happening in London (and, more recently, New York City).  This weekly magazine includes film reviews and the &quot;Time Out Film Guide&quot; is the latest collection of those reviews.<br />The movies are listed alphabetically, but at the end of the book we are treated to a list of &quot;Time Out's&quot; readers' top 100 favorites, obituaries for the year 1999-2000, and a section on how to find movies on the web. There are also 15 appendices grouping films by type.  i.e. horror movies, musicals, swashbucklers, etc.  And then, along with several other indexes, one that I've not seen in any other periodical or bound collection:  it is a general subject index.  Interested in finding a film that was adapted from the works of Bertolt Brecht or movies that feature the British Museum, a list of Israeli, Iranian or Indian films, or perhaps you need to find movies about child prodigies---this is your source.<br />In all, 13,300 movies are reviewed, with very strong coverage of independents and international films.  And it weighs less than my cat.  Highly recommended.	2001-04-15

You'll see yourself in these photos.  <br />Look:  There's your sister sitting on the trunk of your old family coupe; there's your fourth grade girlfriend eating cotton candy at the beach; there is that California hunk caught with his pants down.  <br />Have you ever seen one of those Kodak square box cameras?  You know the kind that took small, shiny snapshots that were kept in large, rectangular scrapbooks with matte black pages, the snapshots held in place with black adhesive corners?  This book is filled with them and each tells a story.  But since the reader has no idea who the &quot;models&quot; are, each story is a mystery.  <br />Why is that well-dressed woman saluting the ocean liner as she walks briskly by?  Or, is she simply holding her hat down in a strong wind?  Who buried those kids in the sand?  Why is Gramma being forced to play with a hula-hoop?<br />&quot;Summer Vacation&quot; is real nostalgia for those who lived and grew up in the 40's and 50's.  And it is imagined nostalgia for younger, inquisitive minds. It is a book to treasure and my only complaint is that it should have been, at least, twice its length.	2001-04-12

They are ALWAYS on the road and when they are not busy eating, they are certainly busy writing. Here I am in New York City where many of the top restaurants in the world are located and, frankly, I'd rather be eating a stack of diner pancakes or snacking on a lobster shack crab roll or finishing the meal with a slab of chocolate cream from a pie palace!  After all, I am the guy who drove once from Miami to Key West, stopping way too many times to decide whether Key Lime Pie was different on each and every Key.<br />The Stern volume can squeeze into your glove compartment and while you're driving,  whoever's in the passenger seat can whet your appetites reading out loud about what's coming up ahead.<br />The book is easily, cleverly divided into large chunks of states and then again into individual states.  Do you know where to get flannel cakes or schmaltz?  Ever drunk a cabinet? (no, not a cabernet.)  Do you know the difference between Indian and Grape-Nuts pudding?  Read the book.<br />This is a funny, charming and totally informative volume.  You'll love it.  And you'll USE it.	2001-04-02

A friend found it for us in &quot;Trattoria Cooking&quot; and gave us the book as a gift.<br />I cannot tell you how many times this easy-to-use, non-intimidating volume has saved dinner.  The book is loaded with simple, authentic, family-style recipes.  Every single one I've tried has turned out perfectly the first time, including the penne which is still one of my favorites.  Caggiano does not drown her collection with overripe prose.  Instead, she explains in one or two paragraphs why she has chosen the recipe and the region and specific trattoria it comes from.  She also suggests the best wine to go with dinner.  No glossy magazine photos either.  Just good food.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2001-04-01

So although it is always better to SEE a play rather than READ it, that may not be very easy.<br />&quot;Orpheus Descending&quot; deserves to be rediscovered--a highly poetic, gothic horror story of the battle between art, spirit, soul and sensuality, sexuality.  Originally written for the brilliant Italian actress, Anna Magnani, it was in fact played on Broadway by the equally brilliant American, Maureen Stapleton.<br />&quot;Suddenly Last Summer&quot; was actually the basis for a very long, very self-conscious study I did for a college psych. class.  Here in one of Williams most &quot;symbol-laden&quot; plays is his cry for an unfeeling world to accept human beings with all their faults (BECAUSE of all their faults, perhaps?) told through the disturbing memories of a woman whose family wants those memories shut up at any cost.<br />All three movie versions of these plays are faithful to the originals UP TO A POINT.  Try to see the plays, but if that is impossible do yourself a favor:  read all of Williams, including his poetry and short stories, and start with this thrilling volume of 3 of his best plays.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	2001-04-01

The tales are all about the land and the people who have lived there for centuries.  And they are all fascinating.....simple, true stories that will help one believe, again, in the human race.<br />This book is a perfect companion to that other fine book of Italian (i.e. human) discovery:  &quot;Under The Tuscan Sun&quot; by Frances Mayes.	2001-04-01

As a collector of art photography, I am, naturally, interested in young, up-and-coming photographers and their work.  I saw a published photograph by Andrea Modica, found out that she lived and worked in upstate New York relatively near me, and then, a short time later, saw this wonderful paperbound collection in the Smithsonian bookshop. These black and white, almost classically composed, portraits of minor league players are brilliant character studies which constantly surprise the viewer.  They show friendship and athleticism, a competitive spirit and, yes, eroticism.  They are magnificent.  Strangely enough, the highly informative interview with the photographer is uncredited.  If you are interested in photography and/or baseball, you owe it to yourself to buy this book.	2001-03-18

With such &quot;important&quot; writers as Susan Sontag and Paul Monette and David Leavitt as contributors, this compilation is one that must be read and savored.  The title refers, obviously, to the way that AIDS has forced itself into the daily lives of all of us.  Who among us does not know someone who is now ill or who has already died of this disease?  In point of fact, several of the writers in this volume are dead. But the volume is not a polemic.  It is a wonderful, moving, at times funny, entertaining collection. My personal favorite is &quot;In The Gloaming&quot; by a writer I had previously never encountered:  Alice Elliott Dark. Write to Citadel Press and get this book re-printed.  A portion of its sale is donated to AMFAR and a program to help writers with HIV/AIDS.	2001-03-05

Leavitt and Mitchell have collected famous writers thoughts on Italy (D.H.

Prominent among them was A. Aubrey Bodine and his magnificent images of the people of the Chesapeake Bay.  I'd never heard of Bodine but was completely captured by his pictures of the water and the people who live and work on it.  Many of his pictures intrigued me because they look so much like stage settings with actors posed for the pleasure of the camera.  But Bodine was also a portrait photographer, and one of great skill.  This book, with beautifully reproduced photographs, an appreciation &amp; biography by Ewing and a remembrance by Harold A. Williams who worked with Bodine on the &quot;Baltimore Sun,&quot; will surely bring a new and appreciative audience for Bodine.  One cannot help but be impressed with the fog rolling in on a Baltimore dock over two sleeping dogs in 1947, naked boys diving into the Patapsco River in a 1933 photograph which pays obvious homage to Thomas Eakins, or with the 1955 portrait of H.L. Mencken, among many, many others.  Highly Recommended.	2001-02-26

I have read and thoroughly enjoyed all of Sedaris' published work, but I first came across him driving to work and hearing Sedaris on the radio read about his Christmas experience at Macy's Department Store in his &quot;Santaland Diaries.&quot;  I was laughing so loud and so hard that I, literally, had to pull my car off of the highway.  Almost every story on these tapes is that funny and that insightful.  Are they all top notch?  Probably not.

Raymond Carver is one of the finest American writers of short stories and, during his short liftime, (he died at age 50) was acclaimed for this talent.  Critics seemed to create the term &quot;minimalist&quot; and label Carver with it---which I believe caused him a disservice.  What are readers who do not know his body of work to make of this word:  &quot;minimalism?&quot;  Labels, in any field, never quite take the measure of the man.  What, indeed, is a &quot;compassionate conservative?&quot;  Does this label mean that an old-fashioned conservative automatically has no  compassion?  Does it mean that a &quot;liberal&quot; is automatically compassionate? And where do these labels take and leave us?  For readers unfamiliar with Carver's work, does &quot;minimalist&quot; mean that he stints on imagery?  on emotion?  on plot?  If you have never read Carver, you owe it to yourself to find out what all the shouting was/is about.  In his stories and here, in this book of collected poems (some of which are published for the first time), he takes everyday life and makes it resonate with great feeling and extraordinary beauty---be the subject married love, nature, fatherhood, fishing or his quickly approaching death by cancer.  I find one of the the final, very short poems in this book, &quot;Late Fragment&quot; almost unbearably moving.  In it he tells us what he wanted in life:   &quot;To call myself beloved, to feel myself beloved on the earth.&quot;  Very Highly Recommended.	2001-02-06

Any art book is a &quot;poor&quot; substitution for the real thing, but there are some books that can give you true, beautiful examples of specific art works that then, hopefully, can someday be seen live.  Kenna is a British photographer, in his 50's, who now lives in San Francisco....and seems to concentrate, in large part, on landscapes as his subjects.  His images in this book are of the gardens created by Andre Le Notre, &quot;the most important garden designer of the court of Louis XIV.&quot; In approximately 6o plates on 80 pages, we are taken to 10 different locations in France including the Tuileries in Paris and Versailles and Fontainebleau. The photographs are nothing short of breathtaking, obviously taken at dawn or dusk when the natural light is almost unreal. These images evoke mysterious, art movie settings---one almost expects a stranger to appear from one of the designed paths or pools or from behind one of the symmetrical trees or shrubs.  All of it:  the photographs, the accompanying essay, the way the book is put together with obvious care and love is magnificent magic.	2001-02-02

I have always felt that &quot;May Day&quot; would make a superb film--and the screenwriter could lift most of the dialogue right out of the story.  It is that good and simple and dramatic. Actually every one of the stories in this collection is first rate.  Here is Fitzgerald, only in his 20's, writing of American aspirations before, during and after World War I. And no one wrote about this subject better than he did.  The characters are rich and complex, all of them dissatisfied with the bones that life has thrown them, all of them desiring what others have.  The reader sees their foibles and loves them anyway.  These are not perfect people.  They are real people in a time of trouble--fighting, most of them, simply to stay afloat in a world changing faster than anyone would have thought possible. I cannot recommend these brilliant stories highly enough. There is also a brief life and appreciation of Fitzgerald in this lovely Scribner edition.	2000-12-27

What a wonderful read!  This is a  passionate tale about love and duty, honor and sex, fidelity and family.   Every single character (&amp; there are dozens) is drawn fully and deeply,  even those characters who appear only for a few pages.  The story is a  simple one with its routes in &quot;Romeo and Juliet:&quot;  two families  forever at war even after they've forgotten why they are feuding.  It is  also a story of a small town in Ireland and every single one of its  inhabitants and how they effect the three principal characters:  Joseph, a  farmer, and his sister Breege who falls in love with Mick Bugler, a  stranger from Australia, and how their love for one another changes  everyone's life.  You cannot help but know that the story will end  tragically, but because you care for each of the principal chararacters so  much and because Edna O'Brien refuses to label some good and others bad,  you keep hoping for the inevitable to be put off.  O'Brien is obviously  influenced by James Joyce:  her language is at all times ripe and  imaginative and wonderfully descriptive.  Her prose also reminds me of  William Faulkner and the way he had of burrowing deep into the minds and  souls of his complex people.  This is certainly one of the finest  contemporary novels I have read in many years.	2000-08-04

This book is beautifully  produced with some magnificent photographs.  Lynes' life story is not a  happy one:  in love with a man who was killed in WW2, finding more success  with his fashion photography than with his &quot;artier,&quot; more  creative photographs, death at an early age by cancer with a large  percentage of his work unpublished.  This volume goes far in reaching a  public which should be able to see the work of this man who was an obvious  influence for later photographers like Robert Mapplethorpe.	2000-07-07

A friend gave me her copy of &quot;The Chimney Sweeper's Boy&quot; and I was hooked from page 1.  The numerous characters are all complex and fascinating--even the minor ones;  the plot, although I guessed the &quot;mystery-surprise,&quot; unfolds beautifully--I certainly do not want  to tell you any of the twists and turns (&amp; there are plenty)of this  &quot;psychological mystery;&quot; the writing is graceful, but never calls  attention to itself.  This is a truly terrific story told wonderfully. I  have already purchased my second Barbara Vine book and cannot wait to start  it.	2000-06-17

Arthur Laurents' professional life has taken him from obscurity to the highs of Hollywood to the highs of Broadway.  And personally, he obviously always felt that a lover was more important than a hit.  Laurents pulls no  punches.  He takes the reader on a journey like none other I've read about:   having worked with almost every big (and little) name in the theatre and  film, he lets us in on backstage drama and trauma.  And he tells how he  survived.  As to his personal life, it is ALMOST as heady as his writing  career.  His story is informative and exciting and romantic and funny and  moving.  This is a MUST READ.  400 pages goes by in a flash.	2000-04-18

Crowe has done his homework and knows almost as much about Billy Wilder as Wilder does,  himself.  Crowe reminds him and prods and teases and the result is one of  the most interesting books I've ever read about Hollywood movies and the  &quot;system&quot; that used to control them.  The reader becomes so  &quot;friendly&quot; with Wilder and Crowe throughout the book, that the  ending becomes very moving.  I recommend this book to any student of film  of any age &amp; anyone who just loves movies.	2000-01-17

She is now, obviously, the flavor of the month, so I thought I'd take this book off my shelves where it has been gathering dust for years.  Obviously, O'Brien is  influenced by James Joyce, but her poetic language is all her own and  beautiful it is. One of the stories, though, actually put me in mind of  William Faulkner, another writer who can delve mysteriously into the hearts  of his characters.  All these stories are heartbreaking and charmingly  funny and all too real.  The characters are living, breathing human beings.  I recommend this book highly and hope it is back in print very soon.	2000-01-01

The book was a revelation:  the idea that a gay, young man can be the sexual 'dear abby' to so many people (gays &amp;  MOSTLY straights! )  telling them when, how and why to do it and not do  it, is pretty exciting.  Savage writes well, clearly, simply and, when he  wants to be, is always very funny.  I just bought his latest book,  &quot;The Kid&quot; and look forward to reading it, too.	1999-11-26

It took me over one year to finally read this book.  I just did not want to even think about another of those slim, self-help philosophy of life primers.  But on page one, I was caught! This book is a MUST READ for  everyone.  I, literally, cannot think of anyone who would not be moved and,  hopefully, changed by the work done by these two men, chatting while one of  them prepares for death.	1999-11-26

Start with &quot;One For the Money&quot; and meet all the major characters in Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series.  Then  go on to &quot;Two for the Dough&quot; which is even better, faster, more clever.  These are truly  interesting  mystery yarns with funny situations and even funnier  characters.  Everytime Stephanie, a divorcee, has to go back to her family  home (even for a simply, short meal) the reader knows he/she is in for  laughs.  I wish that the solution and wrap-up of this adventure were not so  totally pat &amp; predictable, but that said, I recommend the book highly.	1999-10-22

There is no flab on Stephanie Plum, the heroine of Evanovich's funny, fast-paced, exciting mystery-thriller.  And there is no flab in the book.  Truly a rapid page turner. And laugh-out-loud funny with true to life, and  yet outrageous, characters like Stephanie's mom and grandmother.  I can't  wait to read the other books in this series.	1999-10-03
