This is an excellent book if you want a great variety of bread recipes from around the world -- from sweet rolls, to Sunshine Bread, to Mexico's anise-flavored &quot;Bread of the Dead.&quot;<br />Pro(s):<BR>- Excellent variety. If you have a desire to make unusual bread (e.g. traditional ethnic, holiday, dessert), this is a great resource! <br />- Good pictures. Many of the breads (approximately 60-70%) are featured in large, full-color pictures. This is helpful if you want to check out a finished product.<br />- Good instructions. So far, the 6 recipes I have made have been accurate and the directions have been easy to follow.<br />Con(s):<BR>- Many of these breads require time in the bread maker and time in the oven. I like this because I can create bread in a variety of shapes, sizes and textures. However, some may frustrated because the book doesn't concentrate on &quot;set it and forget it&quot;-type (i.e. breadmaker *only*) recipes.<br />- You may have to play with the measurements a bit. Of the 6 types of bread I have made, 2 of them have come out rather dry. (The Sunshine Bread, in particular, bordered on sawdust-y.) However, I realize this may be an issue of personal taste rather than a criticism of the book.<br />- There is essentially one recipe for each type of bread. As such, if you want to concentrate on Sourdough or Rye bread, for example, you will likely want to purchase a different or supplemental cookbook.<br />Enjoy!	2002-07-02

Yesterday, my pants kept slipping down!<br />The book, complete with large, black and white pictures, is arranged by exercise group (e.g. butt, arms, back, abs), allowing you to pick and choose which area(s) you would like to focus on. Detailed instructions are listed for each exercise. <br />What I like is that this book encourages a healthy lifestyle by promoting moderation. The author discourages straining muscles or going on a starvation diet. <br />The book assumes that you have both little time and little space to work out. As such, most of the strength training exercises can be completed in approximately 1/2 hour in a very small space. <br />Frankly, I would rather eat a bag of broken glass than exercise. However, this workout is high-impact enough to get results, but easy enough to keep my interest.<br />My only criticism has to do with the construction of the book. The book is very tightly bound. As such, it's difficult to hold the book open *&* concentrate on your form, especially when you're learning new excercises. Ring binding is a must for the next edition!	2002-05-24

This cook book has it all -- vegetarian goodies, fabulous deserts and about 100 ways to cook chicken.<br />So far, I have tried about 6 recipes from the book. All have turned out beautifully. (The Spinach Pie, in particular, is fantastic.)<br />Here are a few notes:<BR>- This book contains several thousand recipes. If you only plan on buying *one* all-around cook book, this is an excellent choice.<br />- In most cases, the book favors taste and ease (Think: Yummy Everyday Meals) over elegance (Think: Fancy, Sitdown Dinner for 25).  <br />- The instructions are descriptive and easy-to-follow. (I like that this cook book makes no assumptions about your cooking skills -- or lack thereof.)<br />- The book is arranged with the main ingredient in mind. For example, say you just bought some spaghetti squash and you are unsure how to prepare it. Flip to the spaghetti squash pages in the vegetable section and you'll find detailed preparation instructions and approximately 2-3 recipes. (This is an excellent feature to use after you've made an impulse buy in the vegetable aisle of your local grocery store.)<br />Enjoy!	2002-05-07

Focusing on the events, people, and situations that shaped Martha Stewart's life, Byron (the author) examines what made Stewart the billionare and domestic icon she is today. <br />Interviews with Stewart's friends/former friends/colleagues/family and exhaustive research into Stewart's life and times forms the basis for Byron's insights into the modern day media mogul. In his witty, articulate musings, Byron paints Stewart as a shrewd, tenacious woman of contrast who posesses incredible business savvy.<br />Learn about Stewart's life in Nutley, New Jersey, her flirtation with modeling, her short-lifed career on Wall Street, and the business moves she made that both shaped her life and, ultimately, the American domestic aesthetic. <br />DO expect a healthy dose of  behind-the-scenes Stewart gossip and acidic comments by scorned friends and business associates. However, DON'T expect a hatchet job. Where appropriate, Byron is careful to temper innuendo with facts and figures. <br />Regardless of whether you are a Stewart fan or critic, this book will likely give you a deeper appreciation of the success she has achieved and the impact she has made.<br />Very highly recommended.	2002-04-11

However, after a panic attack, wedding-related snapping match with my fiance, and an explosion from my typically docile mother, I decided to treat myself to this book.<br />IT IS WONDERFUL -- A MUST FOR EVERY BRIDE.<br />The book doesn't cover topics such as \\"Finding the Dress of Your Dreams!\\" or \\"Saving Big Buck$ on Wedding Supplies!\\" Rather, it discusses the myriad of feelings, changes, and issues that pop up during the wedding planning process. The author articulates that a wedding is the visible sign of two people, two families, and many opinions joining together, so there's bound to be some drama.<br />The title is a tad misleading, as this book does not coddle the bride or permit \\"Bridezilla\\" behavior. For example, if you're looking for a book that justifies bullying around your bridesmaids or teaches you how to be a wedding dictator, this is not a book for you. This book is for the normal, rational gal who has just been thrust into the wedding spotlight.<br />Key topics include: money vs. power, dealing with troublesome people & strong opinions, avoiding hurt feelings (whenever possible), discussing religious choices, choosing your battles, and keeping your sanity. These topics and others are addressed with respect and humor. You'll find yourself enthusiastically nodding in agreement and giggling as you read along.<br />This is a great book crack to open after you've heard *yet another* well-intentioned person insist on where you *must* have your wedding registry.<br />Very highly recommended.	2002-03-27

If I could use decimals, I would have given this a 3.5.<br />This is a great book for a bride who has never given a moment's thought to planning a wedding. This book covers the super-duper basics of venue selection, clothing, invitations, pre-wedding parties, etc. If you fall into this category, this book will be very useful starting point and, as such, a good investment.<br />If, however, you are a bride who has already purchased a few wedding books or are a regular on wedding Web sites, this book will likely repeat a lot of information you have already read, without adding any new insights. <br />Here are a few notes:<br />- The section on gown selection is quite good. It has easy-to-understand descriptions and line drawings. (If you ever wondered what the heck a \\"basque waist\\" is, you'll find it here.)<br />- Many of the vendors listed in this book are located in California. This can be helpful to California brides.<br />- The book is very aesthetically pleasing. (The translucent book jacket is an elegant touch.) <br />- The information on pre-wedding parties (e.g. showers, engagement parties) is pretty simplistic. If you are planning a pre-wedding event, I would suggest looking elsewhere for information. <br />- This is geared to a bride who would like to have a *very traditional* wedding. If this is not your style, this book will likely not be helpful to you.	2002-03-20

Burrell's passages on entertaining and party planning are peppered with touching stories about his employment as former butler to Diana, Princess of Wales.<br />Burrell demonstrates his knowledge and class on each beautifully photographed page. No wonder he was held in such high regard by the royals!<br />A Few Notes:<BR>- I would not call this an \\"Etiquette\\" book, as it deals much more with proper table setting and party planning. As such, I think it would be better labeled as an \\"Entertaining\\" book.<br />- The range of party/theme ideas is impressive. Some of Burrell's examples include a sit-down dinner, afternoon tea, and childrens' party.<br />- For those interested in the life of Princess Diana, this gives you a tasteful and telling behind-the-scenes look. Frankly, some of Burrell's Diana anecdotes were some of the best parts of the book...<br />Enjoy!	2002-03-13

Although you can find most of this information on Internet sites, Peggy Post does a fantastic job of compiling wedding information in one easy-to-use volume.<br />Book highlights include:<br />- Exhaustively Thorough Invitation Section<br />(Example: Outlines specific language you should use if the bride's divorced/remarried parents are jointly hosting the wedding.)<br />- Engagement Outline<br />(Example: Gives recommendations for who the happy couple should tell, when, & how.)<br />- Guest Information<br />(Example: Discusses gift giving, response cards, etc.)<br />Peggy Post does an excellent job of conveying information without sounding preachy. She offers recommendations instead of barking standards.<br />In addition to being a great planning tool, this book is also quite lovely! As such, it would make a beautiful engagement gift.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-03-13

(Excellent book, by the way!) The authors cited _The Mole People_ as their primary reference book, so I wanted to seek out the source.<br />The viseral feelings envoked by the author, and the glorious and sad tales she portrays, help to overshadow the disjointedness of the book.<br />On one hand, expect disproportionate chapter lengths and wild shifts in tone (Non-fiction chapters about the history of underground living pop in out of nowhere). On the other hand, expect extraordinary case studies, fantastic settings, and a study of the endurance of the human spirit -- even under the most difficult circumstances.<br />Each biography is incredible and sad. I like that the author didn't try to artificially manipulate the reader's emotions by inspiring pity. The voices of the subjects comes through strongly. You'll often find yourself admiring the subjects' resiliance and tenacity.<br />Some of the book's success has been overshadowed by controversy. It is claimed that some of the subjects and many of the locations listed in the book are false. Regardless, this book is worth a read, as it inspires you to be thankful for your circumstances and feel compassion for those in need.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-07-30

In this new world, cars take the place of partners, food substitutes intimacy, and alcohol becomes a best friend.<br />_Can't Buy My Love_ artfully combines the intellectual punch of a well-researched thesis with the heart and conversational tone of a personal narrative. This makes for easy, insightful reading. (Case and point: I read it in one day -- in one sitting.)<br />At times this book is hard to read. I winced countless times, recalling many of these advertisements (Many are pictured in the book), wondering how much I had/have been affected by them. Even more chilling is the realization that, as time goes on, we are continually bombarded with more and more advertising -- saturating our subconsious, and perhaps peppering our behaviors.<br />If you've ever needed a cigarette to relax, longed for the comfort of a cocktail, or craved ice cream but still felt you need to lose those &quot;extra 15 pounds,&quot; you should read this book.<br />Very highly recommended.	2001-07-29

I was amazed by this book. Thank goodness for Marg Stark!<br />Stark's insightful, frank text is intended for female newlyweds, brides-to-be, or women considering \\"taking the plunge\\" who want to get some insight into the ups and downs of marriage. Written from the perspective of Stark (a writer/newlywed) and based on interviews with 50+ recently married woman, this book covers everything from mourning the loss of singlehood, to addressing and overcoming the money/power dynamic, to finding fulfillment in sharing your life with another person - while still maintaining your independence.<br />So many books out there are about \\"Planning Your Dream Wedding.\\" However, this book gracefully avoids talk of wedding (except in two of the early chapters), instead concentrating on the time after the honeymoon.<br />Engagement and marriage is a difficult time. Not only must a bride deal with the pressure of a wedding, but also the joy/dramas associated with sharing her life with someone else. Often times, this happens at the same time a bride is trying to earn a living, raise children, go to school, find a new apartment, etc. With each chapter, Stark chips away the stereotypes associated with brides and marriage. Brides don't have to plaster on a smile all the time just because they're told that &quot;this is the happiest time of your life.&quot; Marriage can be fun and sexy. <br />Also, the book carefully avoids the declarative feel of a \\"how to\\" book. Stark simply shares her observations and leaves it up to you to make the decisions. You'll put down the book feeling like you just had a conversation with a sage, understanding friend over a steaming latte.<br />Here are a few notes:<br /> - Both the author and the majority of the brides she interviewed are college-educated, 23-33 year-old professionals. That being the case, the content is skewed to that particular demographic.<br />  - Stark uses many anecdotes from her own life (and that of her husband Duke) to illustrate her points. I found this engaging and enlightening. Some may find it repetitive and biased.<br /> - The book is content-rich with well organized chapters. Readers can easily go back to re-read sections that interest them. (However, I strongly recommend reading it cover to cover.)<br /> - This makes an excellent bridal shower gift.<br />This is not a book to miss. Highly recommended.	2001-05-29

This book was a delight to read -- well-reasearched, descriptive, engaging. _Eleanor of Aquitaine_ gives you the information of a well-researched thesis with the pacing of a novel.  However, it was a subtle disappointment because the information on Eleanor was much less than I had expected. (Note to self: Next time read an excerpt!)<br />Weir sets the reader up in the Forward, mentioning that little information about Eleanor has been found or proven. However, she is quick to point out the difference between her book and the books of other authors attempting to portray Eleanor. Weir claims that some previous biographers have painted a not-so-virtuous picture of Eleanor because they have relied on poor evidence. (For example, many biographers have used fictional works -- poetry, songs -- of the period to prove that Eleanor was an adultress.) <br />A continuing refrain in the book is, \\"Some historians have said X. Contemporary theorists have said Y. Based on the evidence I've seen, I can't decide between X or Y.\\" While I do appreciate Wier's unbiased opinion, it didn't always make for the most interesting reading. Often I felt dissatisfied because I wanted to know more - I wanted to know the truth. However, perhaps that is Weir's point - we'll never truly know what Eleanor was like because there is simply not enough evidence.<br />In order to learn more about Eleanor's life, Wier had to painstakingly resurrect it from accounts of the lives of her children and family members. Consequently, the book serves as an excellent primer about Eleanor's historical period and family. For me, this was an unexpected bonus because I know very little about medieval times, the Crusades, etc. However, readers that are very medieval-savvy may find Weir's extensive (but necessary) digressions annoying.<br />Overall: If you're looking for a peek into the life of a lesser-known historical figure and time period, this book is an excellent choice.	2001-04-27

In several of his examples, security breaches affected the course of history (e.g. outcome of WWII; fate of Mary, Queen of Scots). <br />I'm not what you would call a &quot;math person.&quot; Regardless, I was still able to enjoy this book. Singh is wonderful at explaining complex processes in steps and illustrations we all can understand. For example, instead of launching into a discussion about the algorithms associated with authentication and encryption schemes, Singh first tells you to picture a metal box affixed with several locks. I found each of his examples are relevant, clever, and helpful.<br />For those in the security trade, this is an invaluable book, as it explains the &quot;why&quot; behind the &quot;how&quot; with regard to information security. (Ever wonder what RSA stands for? Thought about how our national standards for bit encryption came about? This book will explain.)<br />Highly recommended to security-saavy persons, puzzle lovers, or anyone interested in history. Excellent!	2001-04-17

I'm a terrible baker, or so I thought...<br />This book is wonderful for the person who is short on time and baking talent, as it combines quick recipes with easy-to-follow directions.<br />So far, I've tried 2 recipes -- the Kahlua cake and chocolate birthday cone cupcakes. I was barely able so test them out before my boyfriend, family, and co-workers chowed down. (Needless to say, they were a hit!)<br />Excellent features: 1.) At the beginning of the book is a photograph of *every cake, cookie, brownie, etc.* with its name and page number underneath. You can save time by looking at finished products, then flipping back to find the recipe. (Excellent feature! I wish all cookbooks were organized like this.)<br />2.) I can't stress the simplicity enough. You can literally put together a dessert in less than 10 minutes. (Note: That time estimate refers to *prep* time, not *baking* time, as the desserts will then have to go in the oven for between 20-30 minutes.)<br />Overall: I would have a hard time discerning a &quot;from-scratch&quot; cake from a &quot;Cake Doctor&quot; cake. The author adds an interesting feature or ingredient which makes the cakes taste very un-like a mix. (For example, in the chocolate cupccake recipe, the author says to use cinnamon -- an ingredient I wouldn't think to combine with chocolate. However, it made a difference. The cake was excellent!) <br />For easy, A+ desserts, this cookbook is a &quot;must have.&quot; Enjoy!	2001-04-04

However, it's one that Tatum (the author) overcomes with sensitivity and candor. I am lucky that someone took the time to write such an informative piece.<br />Tatum relies on her years of research, background as an educator/speaker, and personal experience to discuss the nature of racial differences as they existed (and exist) in America today.<br />Talking about race makes people feel uncomfortable. When engaged in these type of discussions, I have found that people are either on the offensive or under attack, as race inspires a myriad of heated emotions. Accusations fly. People get hurt. Others feel guilty or angry. No progress is made.<br />Tatum does a great job at *confronting* but not *fueling* the emotions associated with race. Therefore, the reader feels comfortable and open to the subject matter -- rather than feeling defensive or angry. Thus, the true meaning behind her words can better sink in. This is an incredible accomplishment.<br />Additionally, Tatum gives the reader practical suggestions on how to be an active anti-racist (i.e. a person who strives for equality). <br />Although I myself am not an educator, I would highly recommend this to teachers, principals, and school admininstration persons, as the book does have a strong educational spin. However, I think that anyone can benefit by reading this well-conceived text.<br />Excellent book.	2001-03-15

However, he also succeeds in this genre. I'm envious of his talent, to say the least.<br />&quot;Shopgirl&quot; is compact and well written. What Martin spares book length, he adds in character depth. His characters are layered and complex. As you read, you'll empathize with their lonliness, family dramas, heartache, and dreaming for things seemingly unattainable.   <br />Be prepared. You're not going to find lots of action, surprise, and adventure between these covers. This is one of those books where it's not so much the story that's interesting -- it's the *telling* of the story, as it unravels in a predictable -- but noneless compelling -- way.<br />I highly recommend it.

The difference is that Laurell Hamilton throws in a fierce heroine, wandering spirits, and the undead. Good stuff!<br />As I understand it, this is the latter in a series of books about these characters. I had never read these previously releasd texts. Despite this, I did not feel I was missing out on anything. Hamilton subtlely throws in enough background information to make you feel whole with the characters and the story.<br />This is what sets the book apart: Anita, the herione, is fabulous! I like that she didn't fit any existing female stereotypes/prototypes. She was a strong-willed, gun-toting woman who uses her intelligence and draw upon her rich, dark history to do her job.<br />Why it didn't get the &quot;5&quot;: A common theme in the book is the characters' quest for power (physical, mental) in a variety of situations. (Note: For those interested in man vs. himself themes -- this is a great look at how different characters deal with the personal dilemma of good vs. evill.) Often, the characters make statements to the effect of, &quot;You know, I could kill you if I wanted to.&quot; At first these encounters were exciting, then became grating in their repetition. <br />Regardless, this book is a great mix of horror, action, and intelligence.<br />I'm hooked. I can't wait to read the whole series.	2001-02-28

This book marks both a departure from her thougtful, sexy horror fiction (e.g. &quot;Lestat,&quot; &quot;Inverview with a Vampire,&quot; &quot;Mummy&quot;) and her fantasy-themed, erotic Beauty series (e.g. &quot;The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty&quot;). It kind of falls in between.<br />The book examines the relationship between an intelligent, conflicted, strong proprietor of a S&amp;M-themed island (Female) and a passionate, creative photographer (Male). (As you may have already guessed, this is not a book for those with conservative sensibilities!)<br />The relationship/chemistry between the main characters is interesting, believable, and sexy. Rice makes you feel as if you know each of them -- and are in the same room with them. You feel their passion and understand their internal struggles.<br />My less-than-stellar rating speaks to the book as a whole -- the story arc, in particular. <br />&quot;Exit to Eden&quot; reads like two books:<br />Book 1:  An interesting love story about a couple who's erotic pursuits help them tap into their feelings about each other, relationships (in general), and power.<br />Book 2:  A story detailing the maintenance and baggage associated with being the proprietor of a S&amp;M resort. (Think: &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; with velvet-covered handcuffs.) <br />Also, because Rice chose to set it in modern times, you have to have a *major* suspension of disbelief. You must believe that an island like this is legal, feasable, profitable, &amp; enjoyable. I had a difficult time doing this.  <br />Summary:  If you enjoy Rice's books and are looking for a departure from her typical themes, read this. <br />However, if you're a person who would like to read your first Rice book, don't choose this one. I think you'll be disappointed.	2001-02-22

I had the impression that Wilbur (the author) spent his hours masquerading himself as a mild-mannered hamburger griller, sneaking into popular eateries, and stealing away with the official formulas -- all for the dining pleasure of his readers. I was wrong.<br />This book is a collection of Wilbur's *interpretation* of secret recipes.  The premise is that Wilbur, inspired by the Neiman Marcus/Mrs. Fields $250 cookie recipe urban myth, set out to re-create his favorite restaurant and fast food favorites. That's quite an undertaking to say the least.  <br />I guess my big problem is this:  I wound up buying a cookbook of how one man *thinks* fast food *tastes.*<br />What redeems the book is that his recipes are pretty good -- and surprisingly accurate.<br />Here are a few notes: 1.) There is a lot of regional fast food cuisine in here. (I'm from New Jersey and I didn't recognize many of the fast food places.)<br />2.) Almost all of the recpies are accompanied by a hand-drawn picture (by Wilbur) of the correct food assembly. Although the drawings were quite primitive, they did the job. My food really *looked* correct -- all I needed was a paper napkin and plastic fork to go with it.<br />3.) I suppose this goes without saying but -- This is not a book for either the truly health conscious or anyone on a special (e.g. vegetarian, vegan, kosher) diet. <br />4.) Families may enjoy this book as moms/dads can handle the preparation and kids can deal with the assembly.<br />Bon appetit!	2001-02-13

That's why it pains me to give this a less-than-stellar &quot;3&quot; rating.<br />Here are a few notes:<br />- The recipes, while yummy favorites (e.g. macaroni and cheese, egg salad) are quite complicated. (By this I mean that many of the recipies require ingredients you wouldn't readily find in your pantry or take quite long to prepare/bake/cook.)  I would suggest buying this book if you have a few extra lbs. of Brie and in your refrigerator and a Sunday afternoon to kill.<br />- The artwork, as always, is stunning. (For those of you who read &quot;Martha Stewart Living&quot; magazines, the look/feel is very similar.)<br />- There are fewer recipies than one might expect. This is a very thin volume. If you want more bang for your Martha buck, I might suggest buying one of her compilation cookbooks. <br />In my mind, anything by Martha is high quality. In the end, though, I wish I spent my pennies on another one of her products.	2001-02-13

He admitted that his motivation was quite selfish as he wanted us to adopt the principles outlined in the text. It turned out to be a great gift!<br />Have you often wondered why you've felt stifled and unmotivated? Have you ever wondered why, despite all of your efforts, you can't get a project completed until after hours? Do you find yourself arriving earlier and earlier and getting less and less done? This book speaks to those issues by describing how the modern, cubicle-studded workplace and unenlightened managers make it difficult to work, produce, and succeed.  The authors' insights are easy-to-digest as they give practical, real-life examples of their observations. Additionally, they offer tips on how to change personal strategies and your environment to heighten personal fulfillment and productivity. <br />On a personal note, I had wondered why my productivity has not been great the past several weeks. While reading this book, I traced the change back to a switch in our office's chemistry. A new team member recently moved into our 4-person office. (This guy is in sales. This requires him to make lots of boisterous phone calls and frequently entertain visitors. I'm a writer who requires quiet and concentration with occasional collaboration. In short, it's a recipe for disaster!) For a while, I contemplated asking for a desk reassignment but thought I was just being picky. This book taught me that I wasn't being oversensitive. I was wasting my time and costing the company money! The result? I have scheduled an appointment with our Office Manager to request a change.<br />This book profoundly changed the way I think about management. Very highly recommended.	2001-02-12

I purchased this before taking a spur-of-the-moment trip to Paris with my boyfriend, based on its excellent reviews on Amazon. I was not dissapointed!<br />This guide provided an incredible wealth of information about everything Paris -- from sights to see, places to eat, and things to do. Almost every site is accompanied with a nicely written description, map, and full-color photograph. <br />Here are a few notes: 1.) The information (allbeit interesting and informative) is about the touristy stuff. If you're interested in going to visit lesser-known sites, you may want to get a supplemental guide. 2.) Make sure to look up every place you go/have gone. I was surprised to found out that many of the seemingly understated little cafes we visited have long, rich histories, which the book very colorfully described. 3.) The restaurant guide, while good, is not entirely complete. If your visit will center on the French culinary experience,you may want to do a little additional research beyond the confines of this book. 4.) This leather bound special addition also contains 4 laminated, easy-reference information cards (menu reference sheet, address finder, Metro map) and a full-size city map, all of which were incredibly helpful and can not be purchased separately. 5.) The section about customs is good, as it contained valuable information on topics such as tipping and using the bathroom. (Interesting Fact: In many restaurants you have to *pay* to use the ladies room -- even if you have already purchased a meal or snack. Make sure to carry a handful of 2 Franc pieces with you at all times.) 6.) The book, though helpful, weighs a ton. Be prepared -- or beg one of your travel mates to carry it for you!<br />Bon voyage!	2001-02-09

Since so many people referenced (or better said, &quot;panned&quot;) this book, I was curious.<br />On one hand, this book lived up to its rather poor expectations. The quality of the writing was fair. (The grammar, in particular, left much to be desired.) Some of the points it made were a little heavy-handed and/or preposterous. (For example, it said that a woman should, at the start of a relationship, never offer to pay for *anything*. I would never do that!)<br />On the other hand, the book encouraged women to reclaim self respect and &quot;be a creature unlike any other&quot; (i.e. understand their own mystery and beauty). I, a feminist, closely resonated with this idea. Along this vein, it gave women a bunch of hints on how to respect themselves and not pander to the whims of a man -- no matter how good he seems. For example, the authors insist that a woman should never cancel plans with her girlfriends to go out with a man. (No one can dispute that sage advice like that.)<br />The authors insist that you must strictly adhere to every single rule for the book to work for you. I disagree. I think every woman can benefit by encorporating one or several of the authors' rules into their relationships. (Note about the word &quot;relationships&quot; -- the authors suggest that married women also use &quot;The Rules.&quot;)<br />Overall: I liked it but I don't think it's the definitive book on love. (Come to think of it, can there *ever* be a definitive book on love?) However, if you've ever been victim of a bad relationship or just need a little encouragement, this is a worthy read, as it can give you some useful and self-affirming tips.<br />Special Note: Since this book is somewhat controversial, you may want to get a book cover if carrying it around with you. I was the recipient of more than one nasty stare and unsolicited comment when reading my copy.	2001-01-11

My cousin lent me her copy during my stay at her house. I purchased my own copy on Amazon the next day.<br />This was such a lovely fable, filled with relevant life philosophies we all can adopt to make our days more pleasant, beautiful, and fulfilling. Its messages are universal. (Don't let the reference to God throw you. This is more of a &quot;spiritual&quot; than a &quot;religious&quot; text.)<br />The key to this book is in the quality of the message, rather than the sophistication of the prose. This being the case, you should expect somewhat unsophisticated language and a large typeface. However, I think the book's simplicity is what makes it so charming and accessible.<br />I can't wait to pass this along to all of my friends.	2001-01-09

Expecting the worst, I was very pleasantly surprised by this kitchy, useful volume.<br />The book contains a collection of Elvis's favorite recipes interspersed with candid photos from his movie shoots and concerts. Almost all the pictures feature Elvis snacking away with a gorgeous starlet by his side.<br />The recipes are homestyle, country cooking. Heavy on grease, light on nutritional value, the delicacies include everything from pie to fried peanut butter sandwiches.<br />Chefs/Elvis-philes will be delighted by the last section of the book which gives step-by-step instructions on how to make the Elvis/Pricilla wedding cake. The recipe comes complete with cake patterns and dimensions. Therefore, if you are planning to have an Elvis-themed wedding, this book is a necessity.<br />While the recipes are good (especially the deserts), one should keep in mind that this is more of a silly romp than a full-fledged cookbook. Also, the book is on the short side. (Think quality over quantity, in this case.) However, it is so clever and nicely done that it is worth your pennies and your time.	2001-01-08

I read this one in a night.<br />This third and final installment marked the final chapters in the life of Josephine, beginning with Napoleon's reign of power and ending with Josephine's death. <br />Each page is filled with stories of Napoleon's love, their mutual passion, and Josephine's strength in the face of adversity. It was inspiring to discover how much she endured. Despite the difference in time periods, I think many of Josephine's trials (infidelity, anger, sacrifice) are relevant today. This is an inspiring book to read if you're going through a difficult time.<br />I still can't believe how fast a read this is -- how compelling -- how interesting. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't put it down. This is surprising to me, as I've never seemed to gravitate to history books. This book, however, is one amazing exception.	2001-01-04

In addition to easy-to-follow instructions, every &quot;finished product&quot; is beautifully photographed and labled. All you have to do is flip through the photograph section at the beginning of the book, select the hors d'oevres you would like to make, mark it with one of the attached silk book holders, and flip to the recipe in the back of the book. <br />Here are a few notes:<br />1.) Included in the back of the book is a good index (This is helpful if you want to search for a specific main ingredient -- like if you have 10 lbs. of asparagus you need to use up.) and a resource guide (This is great for those who don't have a gourmet supermarket within driving distance. Almost all ingredients and tools can be ordered either via the internet, by phone, or mail.).<br />2.) As is typical with Martha's books, the recipes are high on presentation and low on portability. These delicacies are best suited to an at-home cocktail party, as most of the items to not travel well due to their sometimes elaborate construction.<br />3.) A nice feature is the classic recipes section featuring party favorites such as stuffed mushrooms. (These recpies are great, as my guests are not always in the mood for nori or endive.)<br />4.) While I appreciate the design choice to put all of the photos at the beginning of the book, I would have preferred the pictures be featured with each recipe. Expect to flip back and forth a bunch of times.<br />Functional Note:<br />You'll need bookweights or a cookbook stand to hold this open, as the pages are packed pretty tightly.<br />Bon appetit!	2001-01-02

(Oxford English Dictionary)&quot; on a daily basis. While I oft consulted &quot;the great book,&quot; I never appreciated it or its creators. _The Professor_ cured me of that.<br />Wihnchester infuses each of the 242 pages with such an enthusiasm for the subject, such lovingly researched information that one can't help but appreciate _The Professor_.<br />Considering that this is a historical text, the book's organization is interesting. Rather than dividing the text into chronologically ordered chapters, Winchester chops the text into smaller, magazine-like passages. These passages are then included under O.E.D.-inspired subject headings (such as &quot;Bedlam,&quot; &quot;Poor, and &quot;Memorial&quot;) and definitions that speak to the theme of the passage. This technique not only made the text easy to read and digest, but also acted as a gentle and frequent reminder about the power of words and the daunting task of defining them.<br />Interesting Tidbit: At the end of the book, after the &quot;Suggestions for Further Reading&quot; section, Winchester lists the typefaces he used to create _The Professor_. (Now I know where &quot;Monotype Bell&quot; came from!) I had never seen that done before and found it to be a nice touch.	2000-12-26

I first tried the recipies from this book when a friend of the family made them for a barbeque. I asked her the secret of her good cooking when I saw all the men (and women) gobble up what she made.<br />This book is very good at taking good, old fashioned, home skillet cooking and making savvy, health-conscious substitutions. Overall, I found that the recipes were easy to make and involved minimal preparation.<br />Here are a few notes: 1.) Many, many of the recipes involve canned soup (mushroom, in particular) used as a sauce or garnish. If you do not enjoy soup, or canned foods in general, this is not the cookbook to buy. 2.) A number of the recipes involve a product called &quot;Sugar Twin&quot; (aka &quot;Sweet and Low,&quot; &quot;Equal,&quot; &quot;NutraSweet&quot;).  Some people are very sensitive to the taste of this. If you are one of these people (are cooking for one of these people), this is a cookbook to avoid.   3.) This book is very light on photos. Therefore, you won't be able to see pictures of a &quot;finished product.&quot; 4.) Lund (the author) based the book on the &quot;Healthy Exchanges&quot; eating program. Admittedly, I was not/am not familiar with this program. However, if you are, you'll likely find this book helpful as it is based upon that dietary plan/philosophy.<br />If you're looking for a way to cut fat and sugar in a painless way for you, &quot;your man,&quot; and/or your children, this is a nice addition to your cookbook collection.	2000-12-21

In order to do this, he relies on both personal and achedemic experience and sites a number of excellent scientific and psychological resources.<br />This made me, a technical writer, listen to the words I use in everyday business discourse and think about the true meaning behind them. It has made me examine the things I write on a day-to-day basis for clarity and honesty.<br />I feel that I am a better writer and a better business person for having read this book, as it opened my eyes to many things I had been missing with regard to the way we communicate. This is a worthy read for anyone interested in the power of language and the psychology of business.	2000-12-21

I agree with the other readers' sentiments in saying that this cookbook fast becomes an &quot;old standby.&quot;<br />Using readily available ingredients, these recepies take only 20 minutes. (If you're using a mandoline slicer or food processor, you can assemble many of the recipes in a mere 15.)<br />While I do love to cook, I am often left with tons of leftovers, as I am a single twentysomething. The recipes in _Desperation Dinners_ are not only quick-cooking, but incredibly easy to scale. Therefore, I can enjoy good, fast home cooking without leaving tons of leftovers. Also, the side dishes make excellent one-person meals.<br />Additionally, this cookbook is great to have handy if you (like me) frequently have friends and family stop by unexpectedly. I just grab my copy of _Desperation Dinners_, go to one of my Post-It-Note-marked pages, and make something great. Guests always comment on my Martha Stewart-like way of whipping up something delightful whenever they knock on the door. (Little do they know that _Desperation Dinners_ is my secret weapon.)<br />Despite my words of praise, I have a few words of caution: 1.) Don't buy this book if you only like using fresh ingredients, as many of the recipies rely on bottled sauces and condiments. 2.) This is not the best cookbook choice if you're on a low-carb diet, as the meat and veggie-only options are minimal.<br />Regardless, this is a great cookbook!  I highly recommend it.	2000-12-18

The stories run the gamut from laugh-out-loud funny to eerie and touching. The ability to affect his readership on a variety of levels makes Sedaris an excellent storyteller.<br />I had a tough time rating this book. The quality of writing deserves a &quot;5.&quot; However, I usually give &quot;5&quot;s to dazzlers I will pick off my bookshelf time and time again on lazy Sunday afternoons. I tend to give &quot;4&quot;s to books I would recommend readily to mom, grandma, the postman, and my best friend. _Naked_ didn't fit into either one of those categories.<br />I suppose upon reading it, I was not prepared for the very dark undercurrent to the stories. Many of the characters were downright sinister. This made me keep asking myself, &quot;Are these stories true? Did the author actually live through *all* of these experiences?&quot; My heart went out to him. I wanted to give him a nice bowl of chicken soup and the number of a psychologist. This being the case, I suppose I got somewhat distracted by the questionable autobiographical nature of the stories and separated from the subject matter. This being the case, the &quot;3&quot; rating reflects my personal taste and experience with the book rather than the quality of the writing.<br />If you are a fan of quality prose or short stories, you must add this to your collection. Additionally, if you are part of a book club, I would strongly suggest adding this to your reading list as it will spark excellent conversation! (You may even start rehashing *your* childhood woes over a cup of coffee or two.)	2000-12-14

This book is such a delight to the senses.<br />Lovric's beautifully illustrated and arranged book is a compilation of excerpts from love letters written throughout this and centuries past. Often heated, passionate, and always articulate, these letters conjure up the idea of timeless love and ageless passion.<br />Next to many of the quotes is biographical information about the author and recipient. The authors' often turbulent relationships parallel those today. Frankly, I was quite surprised by how little has changed.<br />This book took me back to a time past when letter writing was considered an art.  While e-mail is a great tool nowadays, our virtual letters seem to lack the sophistication and thoughtfulness that is prevalant in earlier forms of letter writing. It was so nice to see an author take the time to go back and explore this fine art.<br />Another lovely feature of the book is its inclusion of actual printed letters inserted in paper envelopes throughout the book. (For those who have read the &quot;Griffin and Sabine&quot; series of books -- this is very similar in look/feel.) I felt a thrill opening each envelope and peering at the letter inside. Since each author's handwriting leaves a bit to be desired, Lovric ads a printed &quot;translation&quot; of each letter to the end of the book.<br />I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys the art of letters and has ever been (or plans to be) in love. You won't be dissapointed.	2000-12-08

While I had heard of the legendary Buchwald, I had never read any his books or his popular newspaper column. After having read this, though, I would consider myself a fan.<br />This delicious memoir chronicles Buchwald's experiences in Paris -- finding love, studying on the G.I. bill, getting his first job at the much-revered &quot;Trib&quot; (Herald Tribune newspaper). He recounts these times with a nostalgic air permeated with his delightfully self-effacing wit.  <br />The book stirrs an amazing desire to want to throw yourself in a jet and fly to Paris as Buchwald lovingly describes the food and places that shaped his trip. <br />You may even want to read this book just for the cameos by famous writers, musicians, and politicians. It seems that Buchwald bumped into just about every 20th-century history maker during his time in Paris.  (The part about Ginsburg and Picasso is wonderful!)	2000-12-08

As a pre-exam stress break, I picked it up and started thumbing through it.  I laughed so hard that I had to buy it.<br />_Bunches...of Bunnies_ is a book written to teach children the wonders of multiplication in a fun, silly way.  Low on text, and high on pictures, this is meant for the just-learning-to-read set.<br />I just think the pictures are so adorable. Unlike a typical children's book, in _Bunches...of Bunnies_, the expressive and sometimes mischevious bunnies are featured doing everything from going to school to playing pool.<br />I can't wait until I become an aunt, as I plan to buy this for all my nieces and nephews.	2000-11-27

Books	4	30	31	N	N	Inspiring, Entertaining, &amp; Well Written/Researched	I applaud Gulland, the author, for choosing a lesser-studied historical figure and taking the time to write such an interesting (fact-based) fiction about her.<br />Told in the form of diary readings by and correspondence to Josephine (aka &quot;Rose&quot;), this first of three volumes discusses her early life, adolescence, first marriage, children, imprisonment, and reluctant relationship with Napoleon. During these years, Josephine was surrounded by revolution, intrigue, love, fear, and poverty. <br />Gulland bases the story on her years of reasearch. Her respect for Josephine and the historical period shows in her richly-crafted descriptions. I was entertained by many of the interesting tid-bits of information about he medical practices and beauty rituals of the day.  (I am incredibly thankful that I was born in the 20th century!)<br />This is one of those books I had difficulty putting down. Each diary reading seemed to bring about a revalation which urged me to read on further. I felt like a voyeur -- spying into the life of Josephine by reading her most private thoughts.<br />My only criticism has to do with the pace of the book. At points the story zoomed forward, at other points it sputtered slowly ahead. Rather than pointing a finger at the author, I would likely attribute this varying pace to the subject matter. (Afterall, Josephine's life -- while interesting -- was not always at full throttle.) I expect that the pace will stay more consistent in volume 2, as it covers the most historically active part of Josephine's life.<br />Speaking of the second volume, I have already purchased it.  I can't wait to see what else is in store.  Happy reading!	2000-11-27

It delves into the relationships she has with Phillip and Harry, two very different attorneys. In her musings, Diana compares the safety, connectedness, and simplicity of one relationship with the adventure, intimacy, and joy of the other. She repeadly asks herself the question -- How can a relationship be so comfortable and wonderful and yet so suffocating?  This is a question I'm sure most people have asked themselves from time to time.<br />These dating issues are intertwined with stories of Diana's relationship with Cynthia (her understanding, underwear-modeling sister), her mother (a fashion guru/alcoholic), and Franny (her pious, overbearing, misunderstood, older sister).<br />Christina Bartolomeo has a great gift for characterization. I appreciate that this tale is not black and white -- rather a mix of beautiful greys. By this I mean, each character has his/her good points, bad points, sad stories, and idiosyncracies. That makes the characters real and delightful.  <br />I can't wait to see what else Bartolomeo has in store!	2000-11-22

I will always treasure this thoughtful and special gift.<br />_Girlfriends_ is a collection of stories that explore and celebrate female friendship through the eyes, ears, and hearts of everyday women.  Some of the women were friends for a lifetime, others for a short time. However, all understood and/or demonstrated the meaning of &quot;true friendship.&quot; For example, the stories included everything from the thankful musings of a once-ill woman about the extraordinaty kindness of her girlfriends to a giggly account of how two eerily-simiar best friends met as assigned roomates their first day of college. (The latter tale struck very close to home in a wonderfully spooky way.)<br />While many of the stories tugged at the heartstrings, I never felt manipulated by the authors. (Note: Part of the reason why I don't like the &quot;Chicken Soup for the Soul&quot; series is that I feel that the authors are just dying to make the reader clutch for the box of tissues.)  Rather, I appreciated the &quot;real&quot; tone of the stories, as they read like good conversation shared over a nice pot of Hazlenut coffee.<br />Some readers have commented on the book's simple language and lack of depth. I don't think the goal here was to explore the psychology of friendship, rather I think it was intended to be a simple and beautiful celebration meant to be enjoyed by &quot;Girlfriends&quot; everywhere.

After reading this massive tome, I realized how little I actually know. <br />It's an understatement to say that Kevin Zraly covered a lot of ground when penning this compact wine primer. Zraly managed to address (at some level) almost all aspects of wine history, production, and tasting. Considering the depth and breath of material, this was an incredible accomplishment.<br />Zraly did his best to keep the text lively.  However, his enthusiasm for the subject is sometimes quashed by the sheer amount of information he had to cram in. Therefore, when reading this book, one should expect a very &quot;textbook&quot; feel. If you're interested in committing the information to memory, I would suggest reading chapters in short bursts and shooting back a healthy dose of Ginko Biloba.<br />For anyone interested in wine (on any level), I think this is an excellent investment.  In my experience, there is no better single-book resource on wine. (Also, it's a steal, as the restaurant-taught course regularly retails for $500.)	2000-11-16

My copy is permanently stained with fabric softner, toothpaste, and Diet Coke, as I carried it around with me all day Sunday.<br />As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a biblical fiction based on the life of Dinah, daughter of the legendary Jacob. Written from the perspective of Dinah, it details the lives of the women (specifically her mother, aunts, and friends) who shaped her life.  The &quot;Red Tent&quot; refers to the structure women would retire to during their menstruation in which they would rest, recouperate, share stories, and celebrate life/birth/death. This structure was considered sacred, as only women of child-rearing age were permitted to enter. In this novel, this red tent becomes the center of Dinah's life and her source of joy and strength.<br />This is a rare book.  Never have I read such a dazzling portrayal of biblical woman. Additionally, it is equally rare to read such a celebration of birth and the cycle of life in a beautifully-crafted piece such as this.<br />Admittedly, my knowledge of religious history is somewhat limited.  Therefore, I am taking it for granted that the facts cited by Diamant (the author) are true. However, it appeared to me that she was incredibly knowledgeable about the subject matter. Regardless, Diamant is an incredible storyteller and should be lauded as such.  I can't wait to add more of her volumes to my collection.	2000-11-14

What a great resource!<br />Peggy Post's _Entertaining_ covered a lot of ground -- from serving a formal sit-down dinner in one's home to gracefully declining an invitation to a friend's barbeque.  I especially enjoyed the incredibly helpful section on house guests.  It discussed both how to properly *host* a house guest and how to *be* a sought-after house guest.  (My mother was right.  You should never to a host's house empty handed.)<br />Each tip or explanation is written in a clear, congenial way. Not once did I feel that Ms. Post was &quot;talking down&quot; to the reader. Rather, her tone was similar to that of a friend giving another friend sage advice.  <br />Additionally, I liked how the book was organized, as it broke entertaining into a number of easy-to-follow categories including formal parties, casual cocktails, or impromptu get togethers. Therefore, I could easily pick and choose what I needed to read and save the other material for a later date.<br />I might suggest giving this book as a housewarming gift to a new home owner or as a wedding gift (attached to s place setting) for social newlyweds.  They will surely appreciate the advice of this expert!<br /> <br />It's obvious that Peggy Post inherited many of her skills and zestiness from the famed Emily Post, etiquette guru.	2000-11-14

In Ms. Daley's attempts to radically cut fat, I think she may have cut the taste as well.<br />For example, after slaving over the broccoli and leek soup for hours, I served it to a few members of my family (as part of a &quot;soup and sandwich&quot; dinner).  Although I followed the directions *to the letter*, the soup still tasted like watery, evaporated milk. Needless to say, we ate a lot of sandwiches that night.<br />I don't get it.  Ms. Daley is an experienced, renouned chef.  Perhaps her dishes just don't translate well into print?<br />If you're looking for easy, tasty, healthy recipes, I would suggest you look elsewhere.	2000-11-09

However, it turned out to be one of the most inspiring pieces I have ever read.<br />_The Fervent Years_ chronicles the birth and triumph of The Group Theater.  This group of actors, directors, producers, and theater enthusiasts sacrificed time, money, and easy fame to explore the roots of drama.  The product of their efforts was the creation of a truly American style of theater.<br />Although the book has a decidedly theatrical spin, I think that all readers (from all backgrounds and interests) can benefit from reading this excellent piece. Right before I have to face a major challenge, I whip out my copy and give it another read. <br />Also, Clurman's self-centered, self-celebrating anecdotes never cease to amuse.	2000-11-09

This was one of the best.<br />This book forces you to think about the *why* behind the things you each day (at home, at work, and for fun). It teaches readers to avoid doing &quot;what's on top of the pile&quot; and instead think more in terms of overall life strategy. (e.g. &quot;For what reason am I doing this?&quot;)<br />Granted, the &quot;mind mapping&quot; and endless diagrams can get a little tedious. However, they are necessary for the author to illustrate her points.<br />Much of the listing techniques apply directly to the Franklin Covey Planner organization system.  Therefore, if you have the Franklin Covey Planner, this book will be incredibly easy to follow.	2000-11-09

Who can possibly go wrong with Shakespeare?<br />In my mind, there is nothing better than curling up with a classic right before you go to bed.  Shakespeare's sonnets inspire you to think, dream, and love.  A must for every writer, the sonnets are an excellent primer on structure, metaphor and word play.<br />This book is a steal at 99 cents!	2000-11-08

I happened to run across (and purchase) this book when I was first researching herb growing. Boy, did I luck out!<br />This beautifuly arranged and designed book, is a wonderful resource for rookie herbalists/gardeners.  Topics include the selecting and growing of herbs, harvesting and preserving herbs, and creating gifs and recipes with herbs. Each bit of instruction is followed by an informative set of pictures or diagrams. Thanks to this book I was able to grow and harvest my first potted herb garden -- and make some pretty tasty herb butter to boot.<br />I would caution experienced gardeners and herbalists against purchasing this book, as it will most likely be too basic for them.<br />Before I end this, though, here's a gift idea that I made for a friend as a housewarming gift.  Wrap up this book along with a tiny garden shovel, gloves, potting soil, clay pots, and seeds. She/he will be delighted!	2000-11-08

I can cut my shopping time in half and still serve excellent gourmet meals to my friends and family!&quot;<br />While the recipies were creative and pleasing to the eye as well as the palate, I had difficulty finding some of the ingredients. Ms. Gold's philosophy is, the better the ingredients the better the meal. I can't say I disagree.  However, it was difficult when almost every time I wanted to make something I had to plan ahead and make either a special trip to the grocery store or ethnicgrocer.com. <br />What I did like is that the book encouraged me (a novice cook) to think about how different ingredients taste and function together. This is knowledge I can use with all of my other cooking.<br />Also, I should add that the photography and art design in this book is wonderful!	2000-11-08

However, this book is an exception to that hard-and-fast rule.<br />It's obvious that Petroski knows his stuff.  This book is well researched. My issue has to do with the tone, structure, and repetitiveness of _The Evolution of Useful Things_.<br />I think it would have made more sense to name the chapters by invention.  For example, &quot;Fork&quot; and &quot;Paperclip&quot; may have been more fitting.  Since the chapters were not named this way, the book was difficult to follow. I kept asking myself, &quot;When did he change the subject?&quot; and &quot;How did he make this transition?&quot; Over and over again, Petroski kept repeating himself.  At first this was acceptable (Maybe he's worried that his readership won't follow his line of scientific thought.). By the end, though, it was downright annoying!<br />Also, I would have liked the book to have a slightly different tone. The cover art and jacket summary gave me the feeling that this was to be a quirky, educational reading romp. Upon reading the book, though, I found its tone to be flat and &quot;text book-y.&quot;	2000-11-07

I finished the entire book on the way there.<br />For anyone who deals in the fields of marketing, sales, advertising, or customer service, I feel this is a fun and useful read. In order to instruct readers on the value or good, cohesive, customer-centered marketing, the author uses a long list of anecdotes from his own vast personal experience.  Each chapter is centered around a single, often clever, marketing lesson delivered succinctly. This being the case, the book is ideally suited to readers who can only commit to short bursts of reading. <br />Overall, I found the tone of the book light and fun.  This made for easy reading about the sometimes dull subject of modern marketing.  The author's creative take encouraged me to open my mind and get my creative juices flowing!<br />I think this will make a good addition to a business person's library.  However, it is definitely not a &quot;Marketing Bible.&quot;	2000-11-07

Rather than present these women in a one-dimensional way, Benner explored their lives in all aspects and shared the good, the bad, and the nasty. <br />What I took away from this book is that even the greatest, most admired women have their flaws. Although many of the women were privliged with beauty, wealth, and/or influence, they had to struggle to make their lives a success often in the face of tragedy and adversity.<br />All of Benner's &quot;Great Dames&quot; posessed unparalled tenacity, candor, and spark. This book was both food for the mind and the spirit.	2000-11-07

I finished it in an afternoon.<br />The characterizations were both real and inspiring.  Because of the author's rich, and colorful descriptions, I felt as if I were actually there with the characters. <br />What I appreciated about the book was that it did not end with the main character's coming to America -- rather, this was when her journey began. Therefore, the book delved into how American culture affected and influenced the protagonist's Asian cultural beliefs.<br />I appreciated the positive tone of book.  While the heroine endured many hardships, she rose above them in interesting, awe-inspiring, and sometimes silly ways. The authors did an excellent job of melding the heartbreaking with the happy.<br />I would definitely recommend adding this great work to your bookshelf.	2000-11-01

Because of the wonders of digital cable, I am able to watch the show -- 3 episodes worth -- every afternoon as I'm making dinner.  To date, it's the only show on television that makes me laugh until I snort.   <br />Now that I've painted that beautiful picture, let me get to the book...<br />I was pleasantly surprised by this book and by Nancy Cartwright, the author.  She did a great job of mixing the obscure, behind-the-scenes stuff that fans (like me)love with a pleasant grouping of autobiographical sketches and personal photos.  I hadn't known that Nancy had such a wide-range of voice experience!<br />Truly, though, it was the &quot;Behind the Simpsons&quot; stuff that sold me.  I thoroughly enjoyed about how the show began, what the performers are really like, and how time consuming/complicated it is to put together a 24-minute episode. Also, it was great when Nancy would reference different scenes/anecdotes from the episodes.  I felt like such a Simpsons insider, especially when I was able to say, &quot;I saw that!&quot; or &quot;I remember that!&quot;<br />A final note:  Make sure to look on the lower, right-hand corner of the last hundred or so pages in the book.  By flipping quickly through the pages (think &quot;flip book&quot;), you can see an adorable animated short featuring Nancy and her alter ego, Bart Simpson.  So cute!<br />Make sure to give this to every Simpsons fan on your holiday gift list.  They will definitely appreciate it.	2000-11-01
