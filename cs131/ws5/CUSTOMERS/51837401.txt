I was walking through a local bookstore when the cover of this book caught my eye, and I was impacted immediately. The cover photo alone evoked a huge number of emotions within me, and I just had to buy the book, though I have never purchased a book of photographs before. I took down the title and author, and ordered this book from Amazon.  <br />I am not surprised that this book evoked such strong emotions from the reviewers I've read on here so far. This is an astonishingly powerful book, and I've never seen anything like it. The incredibly evocative photographs are often coupled with a monologue by girls/young women. Both the photos and the monologues are exceptional looks deep into the psyches of girls and young women. There are average girls, popular girls, Latina girls, African American girls, girls at weight loss camp, girls at an eating disorder clinic, nude girls lap dancing....every kind of young woman imaginable. The photos hit me right in the gut....and I am shocked that I've never before heard of this author. Sometimes, the photos were disturbing, but only because they probably hit \\"too close to home.\\" Sometimes, the photos were lovely and peaceful. Sometimes, the photos were shocking and beautiful at the same time. <br />I don't like to \\"tell the whole story\\" in my reviews; I think that completely spoils the surprise element for someone reading a book such as this for the first time. So...let me just say that this book of photos is well worth the money; I'd recommend it to any woman who is well beyond her \\"young woman\\" years.	2003-06-21

I almost gave this book four stars, but only because it has a few flaws, where De Becker's THE GIFT OF FEAR was not only flawless, but taught me more than any one book has ever taught me. Still, this is a powerful book. I read it without stopping for sleep, so I can assure you that it is indeed well written.<br />De Becker shows parents and other adults every facet of possible victimization of children and how to avoid it. When he is teaching his readers, which is always, he uses brilliant examples that we can all relate to. Take this as an example: \\"I would ask which is sillier: waiting a moment for the next elevator, or placing her child and herself into a soundproof sterel chamber with a stranger she is afraid of?\\" Succinctly, he teaches, in that one sentence, so much. How many times have all of us pushed ourselves into an elevator with someone who made us afraid? <br />De Becker's challenge is to empower us as parents, and empower us he does, just as he empowered us in THE GIFT OF FEAR.  He instructs us all on using our intuition to make life or death decisions. I can still recall a time when my son, then just very small, and I were staying at a luxurious hotel. We went to the top-floor pool and walked right into a burglary. How I managed to get myself and my son out of there calmly and completely is a testament to De Becker's lessons on the incredible strength of a mother whose baby is threatened. <br />De Becker teaches us all new ways of thinking and new ways of being and new ways of protecting our children and ourselves from abuse, abduction, violence, crime.<br />De Becker's appendices are worthwhile, too, with listings of excellent books and important organizations.<br />This is a book I would recommend to anyone who loves a baby, child, or adolescent.	2002-05-02

As usual, Ann Rule, in this book, went to great lengths to research even the tiniest detail regarding the case.  However, in this case, Rule made a very long novel out of a case that would have been good at short story or novella length.<br />In no way, of course, do I mean to discount the victim, who was horribly murdered. However, as Ann Rule's true crime cases go, this was a major disappointment for me. I was so overwhelmed by detail that I could hardly make out the story itself. Rule seemed to have sewn her story out of the most infinitesimal stitches. <br />The murder itself, which I would have thought would be the climax, was so anti-climactic that it got lost like a <poof> or a <piffle> in the midst of thousands of words.<br />Rule generally is able to weave an excellent story between vast research and hard facts, but here she seems to have gotten lost in the details. I had the strongest feeling she'd cut-and-pasted her facts into the book itself.<br />This is not an Ann Rule book I'd recommend. I was thrilled to see the publication of a new Ann Rule book, thrilled enough that I couldn't possibly have waited for the paperback. What a disappointment this was!	2002-04-30

I was thrilled to find a new Ann Beattie book (new to me; I'd somehow missed this book in hardcover), and could hardly stand to wait a minute to begin it.<br />What has happened is that after reading the first two stories, I've already given-up on this collection. THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE got such awful reviews that I didn't buy it, so I was excited to find, I thought, a book that would show Beattie at her best. The first two stories in this collection ramble, are artsy as all get-out, and don't have any of the striking clarity I've always associated with Beattie. Has something happened to her? Has she lost her gift? From the two stories I read, it  certainly would seem so. I was so annoyed reading the first two stories that I was tapping my foot as I read, something I just never do. I refuse to make myself finish this book, though I usually feel a terrible compulsion to finish even the worst books. This book is just an utter disappointment to me. I've read the other three reviews here, and I'll read the title story, since it's been well received, but that's about it. What a shame!	2002-04-15

I've admired Dunne's work in VANITY FAIR, so I was really looking forward to a true crime work by him.<br />As far as I could tell, the entire purpose of this book was for Dunne to name drop, from Betsy Bloomingdale to La Comtesse de la Farge (I made that last one up). No crime or investigation was complete without Dunne letting the reader know whom   HE knew who had a big  name, and how much that person admired him. I am a huge fan of true crime, and I found so little of that in this book that I was surprised it was listed as such. If you love  true crime, I would recommend you NOT buy this book.	2001-08-08

This might have been an excellent book if Quindlen had made it into more than 50 pages (including sappy photos that have no context). The story of the death of her    mother   might have been a fantastic non-fiction book. But this is no little gem. It's a waste of time and a waste of money.

It was sort of  like Jane Pauley marrying The Hulk.<br />Nevertheless, since she's nicely successful, I sat back to read this book. I was a college grad a number of years ago, but I wanted to see what she would say. This book was written hecause of a college commencement speech she gave which so inspired people that they insisted she make of a book of it. My question is....why????<br /> Shriver purports to give deep life advice to those graduating college. As far as I could see, this litte book would be more useful for those graduting middle school or perhaps high school. If I were just graduating college, this book would insult my intelligence.<br />Shriver's book has no new insights, nothing you haven't heard before, platitudes that are so common they are trite, and then a whole lot about Shriver herself, including references to how pretty she is.  The only marginally entertaining chapter, and the one that shows a hint of wit, is Shriver's chapter on her marriage.	2001-06-27

As a child, and even now, I've been fascinated by women who would literally give up their lives to prayer. The author traces the changes that nuns have gone through, such as changing their cloistered nature and their covered habits. The only problem for me was that I did not leave this book with any better understanding of the choices women make to become nuns....I had a better idea, but not a complete understanding. The book is really well written. One would think a book about nuns might be horribly boring, but in fact, I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend this book to anyone who finds nuns as mysterious as I do.	2001-03-24

But it's only a small moment, because I then remember that John Walsh's adorable, sweet five-year-old was returned to him, when his little body was found, as just a head. That Walsh has turned his endless pain into a battle like no other for crime victims assures him a big place in Heaven.<br />This book is wonderful. It gives an intensely gripping background look at the making of the Fox show, &quot;America's Most Wanted.&quot; It tells from beginning to end the taking on of a case to the capture of the criminal. But to review this book as such insults it, because Walsh is passionate about protecting victims' rights, and particularly passionate about the murder of children. From his autobiography concerning the murder of his little son, I know that he and his wife, Reve', have gone on to have other children. The sheer courage of this man makes this book one of intensity. There isn't, apparently, a case on this television show that Walsh does not take entirely to heart. When does this man eat?  Perhaps he doesn't have to; perhaps he is an angel here on earth.<br />I finished this book more quickly than I'd have wanted to, because Walsh's voice is so impassioned that he just carried me along.<br />I wouldn't recommend this book particularly to those interested in the media, but rather to those who are invested in the rights of victims, and of the rights of victims' loved ones.<br />This is a wonderful read, and when criminals are captured, you want to put the book down and cry out, &quot;HOORAY!&quot; along with the author.	2001-01-06

Spencer uses her time well. Her background information on the  killers could not have been better written or more well researched. We know the killers well before we ever meet them.<br />Spencer is just as thorough in her description of the  crime, and the trial, and her later interview with Stephanie Martin, one of the killers.<br />Do we come out of this book knowing precisely who did what to the victim, or to each other, and what exactly happened? We don't, but we don't because Spencer tells the whole truth and writes completely honestly. We feel as confused as everyone who committed the crime, or who knew those who did. Both criminals blame the other. Their stories flip and flop and betray each other and themselves. For Spencer to have written a wonderful and coherent book out of such confusionn affords her great applause and admiration.<br />I read this book so quickly just because Spencer draws the reader along so well. She's really an artful writer.<br />All that I disagree with is Spencer's ending.  Not one of my  nutty friends would ever  believe the stories that Stephanie Martin believe of Will. And I question how a God-fearing, &quot;nice&quot; Christian girl could leave home and go directly into topless dancing. Her gullibility, her lack of self-esteem about her own womanhood, and her ability to involve herself, in whatever way, in a murder,  make me believe, as a licensed social worker, that Stephanie was as much a sociopath and psycopath as Will.<br />But that isn't the point of this review, and the ending is quite short. Spencer is in fine form as a writer, and this book is one the reader simply can't put down. Not for one moment does all the detail Spencer gives become boring, because she writes it oh so well.<br />I highly recommend this book.	2001-01-02

It's a lively, introspective look at a female medical student, one that, having several doctors, I needed to read.<br />The book gives those of us who are not doctors a first-hand look at what an intern goes through. While there are some very funny moments, Klass gives us a very intense look at the fears she encountered, the exhaustion, her failures and successes, and her wonderful look at her fellow medical students.<br />I highly recommend this book.	2000-12-27

This is &quot;one of those&quot; true crime books where the author writes the story before the trial has taken place. What is the  motivation? To be first on the scene, or to make money? In this case, as in others, I'm obviously not sure.<br />I happened to watch MUGSHOTS on COURT TV tonight, which featured a female serial killer. This woman was living in the woods by herself, abandoned by everyone, at the age of 15. Her story was so incredibly sad, the ultimate in abandonment and dysfunction, and had been raped repeatedly since childhood,  that I could see, if not understand, her motivation for killing a series of her clientele as a prostitute.<br />What is unclear in HUNTING EVIL is what leads the main serial rapist and eventual killer, James, to become a monster. It is endlessly fascinting to me to try to figure out why someone with a dysfunctional childhood not as stormy as the woman above becomes a serial criminal. I know people who've had childhoods that would make anyone weep, and yet....they, as adults, are, while sad or depressed or angry people, would never commit murder, much less serial murder. In this book, it is never clear what leads James to become a serial sadist, other than his  prediliction for methamphetamine.<br />Disappointingly, the author had no interviews with either of the criminal couple, no interviews with witnesses, no interviews with victims, and no interviews with law enforcement. What he wrote from was notes and interviews given by others. This gave the book a very flat feel.<br />James's partner in crime, Mickie, was so devoted to James that she followed his every  move. We all know women like this, whose wish for love disrupts every bit of moral fiber she may once have had. Mickie is actually the more chilling of the two criminals, sexually assaulting her own  daughter. Still, it's not at at clear why Mickie assaults and rapes and assists in a kill. Is it the methamphetamine again?<br />The reason I call this book &quot;gripping&quot; is solely that its content is compelling and frightening. The writing is disappointing. Too often, Smith directly quotes verbal interviews, so that the reader is left to understand a sentence like this from Mickie:  &quot;No, because maybe I knew, but because I knew, you know what I mean?&quot; Beg your pardon?<br />The topic of this book could have produced a brilliant book by someone like Ann Rule. Unfortunately, it was written by Carlton Smith.uot; is solely that its content is compelling and frightening. The writing is disappointing.

Throughout this book, I  noticed that the author, Kathy Braidhill, kept an emotional distance from the subjects of her book. At first, I thought perhaps she had a psychological problem. After finishing the book, I realized that she'd had to relive such horror that she probably had to take a step back.<br />This is the hellacious story of a madman who posed as the nicest guy on earth. He was let out of prison five times, FIVE TIMES!, before he tortured, sexually tortured,starved, raped, sodomized and murdered little 7-year-old Phoebe Ho over the period of a week. One of the scariest parts of this book is that no one ever learned where he'd kept this child all of that time.<br />Probably the most emotionally drenching part of this book is the sheer grief of Phoebe's parents. Here, Braidhill does an excellent job. I sobbed along with Mrs. Ho. How does she go on after this unspeakable evil was done to her favorite little one?<br />Since I finished this book, I've kept a light on in my little one's room. <br />This book is about a slasher, a rapist, a murderer, the devil incarnate, a sexual sadisst who could have been the guy next door. I suddenly realized what John Douglas has always warned...that murderers and rapists don't always LOOK like the monsters they are.<br />A gripping book. After I was finished, I asked myself, who has this much evil inside of himself? People like this really DO exist, and that is the most frightening thing to realize.	2000-11-20

I often have wondered when Douglas was suddenly going to run out of ideas to work from, when the Douglas writing well was going to run dry,  and indeed, for a while it seemed that he was just running the same idea over and over, or running new ideas weakly.<br />With this book, we get a nice taste of Douglas's profiling and an in-depth look at many cases that have bothered all of us for  a long time in terms of their never having been solved.<br />I found it very interesting that this book is so in-depth that Doulas even includes the Lawrencia Bembenek case, one that even while it happened, was mostly local in interest rather than national. <br />Douglas carries us from the unsolved &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; case all the way to the JonBenet Ramsey case, and  shows us how he'd solve the crimes and who possible suspects might be. I find this clever and interesting writing.<br />He gives powerful energy particularly to the Lindbergh kidnapping and the Zodiac serial killer, and in these two sections, he is at his best, and really gets the reader deeply involved and Douglas himself writing with great skill and powerful ideas.<br />The only weak link in the book is the section on the JonBenet Ramsey killing, which section seems more like &quot;In Defense of John Douglas's Profiling.&quot; <br />Other than the Ramsey section, this is an excellent and even thrilling book, and the first Douglas book in a long time that I couldn't put down.	2000-11-13

The author attempts to tell hilarious stories of exceptionally frivolous lawsuits brought in various Courts. I'm certain the stories themselves would in fact have been funny if the author knew how to write humor.<br />This is Percelay's attempt at humor as he writes about the verdict of a case involving a Little League game:<br />THE VERDICT, Please....<br />  The judge felt that this case didn't deserve to get to second base........An appeals court agreed that the judge's ruling was SAFE. (emphasis the author's).<br />This and other un-funny embellishments of otherwise funny stories is about the level of humor that this book offers. Also completely non-hilarious are the scattered jokes about lawyers; I admit to laughing at only one. And trust me, I usually find lawyers' jokes funny.<br />I cannot begin to imagine what anyone found funny in this supposed  humor book.

Along the way, we learn about his twisted adolescence, and his brushes with madness, depicted brilliantly.<br />The reader has to have come to grips with his or her own demons in order to be comfortable reading this book, in that Ellroy's feelings for his murdered mother include the incestuous feelings Freud always claimed we all feel for our opposite sex parents. Ellroy describes these feelings with enormous intensity. In fact, this book is all about intensity, from the first page to the last.<br />I've read any number of true crime books, and though this is not exactly a true crime read, that's about as close as the reader can come to describing it. In the books I've read, the victims have, unfortunately, not been described intently enough that I've really remembered them after I've finished the book. With My Dark Places, Ellroy so intensely describes his mother, Jean, that she is as real to me as  someone I knew intimately.<br />I think, in fact, that &quot;intimate&quot; describes this entire book. Rather than give away any of the story, let me just say that this book is as intimate as a dark night's sexual encounter with someone dangerous.<br />This is one of the best books of any kind that I've yet read.	2000-10-23

I was interested to see what King would have to say.<br />I'd like to preface this review by saying that I was so engaged by King's advice on writing that I went to his website to drop him a friendly note. I was aghast to find that an intuitive response to that website would be, &quot;This man hasn't got time for a letter from a lowly reader.&quot; This took me aback,given the intimacy with him, or at least friendliness, I felt in reading this book,  but didn't really influence my feeling about ON WRITING itself.<br />King has written a two-part book. One is a memoir of his growing-up years. I'd like to suggest that Mr. King not write memoirs. He's dreadful at it. The memoir section is chockful of cliches and attempts at irony that fall flat on their butts. An example of how terrible this section is, is his mother's death scene..... irony at its absolute worst. Dreadfully distracting is his habit of calling his wife, Tabitha, by several names....Tabitha, Tab, Tabby, and within one paragraph, Tab AND Tabby. I suppose this is nit-picking, but in this short a piece, I found it cutesy and disconcerting.<br />Feeling discouraged, I proceeded to the second section, his advice on writing. For a man who says he can't write non-fiction, I found this part brilliant. I learned more from this section in a short book (a short book for King, I should say)about writing than I could have learned in a score of writing classes. There were parts of the  section where I literally laughed out loud. This is a witty man. <br />In the second section, everything was quite clear and well written. The only concept I could not grasp was King's concept of &quot;truth&quot; in writing. He never quite gets across to the reader what he means by this. Other than that, I could not have asked for a more informative or well-written piece on the art of writing. It so excited me that I, in the virtual sense, ran to Amazon and ordered two of the books he uses as examples of bad writing, his point being that we need to read excellent fiction as well as terrible fiction in order to write well. For me, the most impactful part of this section was King's giving permission to the reader to take a huge chunk of each day to write and to read. Prior to this therapeutic persmission of King's, I'd felt guilty doing either. It honestly worked!!!<br />My only real criticism of this second section is really a compliment. I wanted more, more and more.<br />The next section was a surprise for me. In it, King relates the details of his terrible accident and its aftermath. I didn't expect it in this book. Interesting to note is that King states he wrote the memoir before his accident, and the piece on actually writing during his painful recovery. I say this is interesting because I found the latter far superior to the former.<br />There is a fourth mini-section, where King shows the reader an example of editing, and this is quite informative.<br />The last section is a reading list of the books he's read (in the past year, I think) lately. While I wasn't moved to run out and order any of them, I found this very interesting background information.<br />If I were King, I would have cut the memoir and cut right to the chase of what is best and brilliant about ON WRITING ....the craft of writing as King sees it.	2000-10-17

The  editors/authors really obviously had just a ball writing and collecting  this, and their humor and enthusiasm carries, BANGO, right through to the  reader.<br />If you've been reading too much heavy literature, as I had when I  ordered this book, this will really lighten you up.<br />I nearly died  laughing over the blurb about &quot;OPEN MARRIAGE&quot; by the O'Neils in  the late 60's (or was it early 70's). In my first, most ludicrous marriage  on earth, my first husband was a great believer in this, had me read it,  and at the time, I took it quite seriously. What a hoot to read it again  now and see how truly ridiculous it was! And it was such a sign of the  times! <br />Each and every entry takes you back to the time it was written  (even if you weren't around then), and really gives the reader a strong  sense of the times.<br />The only things I'd have changed? I would LOVED to  have read  more   deeply into the marriage manuals of old, would have loved  to have read much more in detail on those....and I would have really loved  to read at least a longish blurb from the &quot;marriage/romance comic  books&quot; they mention only by title. I think lengthening these two  aspects would have made me give this book a five-star rating.<br />No matter  how you feel about marriage, you simply won't be able to resist being  entertained by this book.	2000-09-02

In Richard Belzer's case, the answer is  yes...AND he is married to a beautiful wife...AND he lives in France.<br />Can  a book be, at the very same time, a serious discourse on conspiracies AND  be hysterically funny?  This book of  Richard Belzer's can.<br />What a  talent! I hope you don't think I'm being facetious. Believe me, I'm not. At  the same time Belzer got me really thinking about his conspiracy thinking  (and I am a conspiracy theory novice, so this is all new to me), he also  had me literally laughing out loud. I call this remarkable.<br />99.9% of the  books I purchase, I buy at Amazon. But I found this one in the  &quot;HUMOR&quot; section of our local independent bookseller. I'd been  reading such heavy-duty literature and non-fiction for so long, I thought I  could use some humor...and I was NOT disappointed in that regard in  Belzer's book.<br />But what blew me away (I seem to be, in this review,  totally talking in the hippie vernacular, so please, bear with me) is that  along with laughing out loud, I found myself immersed in a beautifully and  accessibly written treatise on conspiracies. I learned so much!  I went  running, upon being done to the book, to my computer to look things he'd  recommended up.<br />What a book! WHAT A CONCEPT! This guy is brilliant! I  recommend it for humor, I recommend it for an introduction to conspiracy  theory, and I recommend it for some truly excellent writing.<br />Get this  book, please! You'll thank me for it.	2000-09-02

This is a sweet  book about being the father of two daughters. But don't expect any  blockbuster insights into parenting. And don't expect any &quot;AHA&quot;  moments from this book. You CAN expect to hear Roker say, &quot;YIKES&quot;  way too many times. <br />I'd purchased this book because I'd done so much  heavy reading lately, and I was hoping for something more confectionary,  and that's what I got. However, once I'd finished the book (quickly), I  wasn't full. <br />There is so much more to parenting and marriage than Roker  shares with us. But if you are looking for a light read that doesn't tax  your intellect,   take a break and read this.<br />If you like Al Roker, as I  do, you'll walk away from this book still liking him.  But  &quot;YIPPEE&quot; is about as intellectual and insightful as this book  gets.	2000-08-28

When I began the first few pages of this book, on a sleepless night, I prepared to be bored by what, at first glance, seemed to be flowery language with no sweat shed.<br />How wrong I was. Roiphe has written the best  memoir I have ever encountered.  Each character is so well described that I  swear I could pick any one of them out in a crowd, regardless of whether  they are now dead or alive. I normally have some distaste for changes in  tense, but Roiphe achieves this so artfully, I rarely noticed. <br />Roiphe,  though her descriptions are vivid and not in any sense concise, does not  waste a word. I sometimes found myself unexpectedly laughing, and at one  point, incredibly, weeping. Her analogies, her descriptions, her  words....all are just remarkably brilliant. I will never be able to forget  her family anymore than Roiphe herself will. Her talent is nearly  incredible.<br />Even when Roiphe is at her most descriptive, the reader is so  present in this memoir, as if we are standing slightly to the side of  Roiphe,, at her elbow, throughout the entire book. We understand  everything. <br />I couldn't recommend a memoir more highly than I do this  one, and at that, I couldn't recommend any book more highly than I do this  one. I've found a new favorite.	2000-07-23

This book would have horrified the entire United States had it been published in, say, the 50's. I recall looking at it when it was published and turning up my nose.<br />As far as literature, I'd rank this book as a  really fattening and delicious chocolate truffle, not one bit edifying but  a wonderfully fun romp through Hollywood scandals of yore, some of which I  was not at all familiar with.<br />I read it in a night, and recommend it with  your evening tea or cocoa.	2000-07-20

While philosophically, as she explores the Kabbalah, she is quite brilliant, Goldberg has clearly not had enough life experience to solidly  portray a dysfunctional family rotting from the inside.<br />Her touch of  brilliance is the ending, where the entire theme of the book becomes most  apparent. Father Saul has in fact destroyed his entire family in his need  to have them excel.<br />Her portrayal of the lost mother does not ring true.  Having known madness in a professional and personal way, Goldberg's  portrayal of Miriam lacks the sweat and tears of real madness.<br />Compare  this novel to David Leavitt's Family Dancing, written when he was quite  young. When reading Leavitt's novel, I was shocked by his grasp of life, of  emotional depths, of adulthood.<br />Goldberg's view of the family shows  her  immaturity. As the mother of a gifted 13-year-old, I know full well that no  9-or-10-year-old child could fully digest and read all that Elly, the child  in this book, can read and assimilate. Impossible, even for a bright child.  <br />The family's dysfunction through the entire novel feels badly contrived,  as though they were the imaginings of a young woman who has never had two  children, one adolescent, one pre-adolescent. And in fact, she hasn't.  <br />In dramatic scenes in this book, the  lack of Goldberg's worldliness  shows when she overdramatizes.<br />In all, this book's real impact is at the  end,  and I often grew quite impatient with the book, which clearly was  written with the ending in mind. The characters don't ring true, nor does  their dialogue.<br />Though this book was highly touted, I disagree with all  who thought it brilliant. I don't recommend it. Not everyone who writes a  decent first novel is necessarily gifted with a monumental debut.	2000-07-18

Thomas is no angel, and I'm not sure that I much liked him at the end of reading this book, but his points are  well-taken. The reader learns immediately that Thomas believes Patsy Ramsey  was the murderer of her daughter, JonBenet. I admit that when I opened this  book, I was convinced the Ramseys had nothing to do with this child's  murder. However, though of course my opinion is of little importance to the  world, Thomas convinced me that Patsy Ramsey did indeed accidentally murder  her child in a fit of rage over JonBenet's having soiled her bed in the  night. <br />The book is very well done in terms of cataloguing details about  the case that most people knew nothing about; certainly I learned a great  deal. It's also well organized. The only gripe I have about it is Thomas's  including his resignation letter in the book. The letter is too long,  incredibly self-serving, arrogant and boring to read. If he'd edited the  letter or left it out entirely, it would be an even better book.<br />If you  enjoy true crime and are as interested in this tragic case as I am, you'll  love this book.	2000-07-07

I read this in one night,and couldn't put the book down. Harrison does not waste one  single word. Rather than frightening her reader, Harrison convinces us that  what happened to her is the  most natural,though not the most normal, of  experiences, as traumatic as it was. It is nearly impossible to describe  how beautifully Harrison has written about what could be a shocking and  artless book. A psychiatrist I once knew was convinced that all women want  to sleep with their fathers. Well, that was in the mid-60's, and that  Freudian thought is old-hat now. But Harrison draws her reader into the  dreamlike state she found herself in with great skill.<br />I highly recommend  this book.	2000-07-07

Her usual well-researched  detail is not as much in evidence here, though she does better here than  with Lust Killer and Want-Ad Killer. The courtroom scene was so boring that  I found myself skimming paragraphs, something I only do when I've lost  interest and want to get DONE.<br />Anyone who's interested in Ann Rule would  be better served by reading her later works, which are superb.<br />When Ann  Rule is at her best, she carries me along to the point that I'm up locking  doors. In this case, though Woodfield's crimes were utterly terrifying,  Rule seems so distanced as an author that the crimes' true impact is lost.	2000-06-13

I'd be truly interested to hear from Ann Rule herself about the re-issuing of books that seem to pre-date even Rule's &quot;first book,&quot; The Stranger Beside Me, and how and why she was writing under the  name Andy  Stack. Then again, perhaps others know the answer to these mysteries.<br />I  found this book to be interestingly different from Rule's later  publications, where her writing is &quot;thick,&quot; and her details  incredibly thorough. This was a book that, I thought, was somewhat weak  compared to Rule's later writing, though I will read anything that she puts  out.<br />As I've been reading all three titles that were reissued, I am  struck more and more by the thought, &quot;Where do these monsters come  from?&quot; I had a childhood that could  match any of these murderers for  sadness, despair and abuse, yet I haven't a violent bone in my body. I'm  always interested when Rule tries to probe that question.<br />My impression  of this book is that its a lukewarm telling of a scary story, and it's an  interesting read in that it's Ann Rule at her earliest.	2000-06-10

As with The Lust Killer, this reissue of a book that Rule apparently wrote, under the pen name of Andy Stack, is very weak in comparison to her later work.<br />She skims over details here that later in her writing she  would have included.<br />The Courtroom scene is rather dull in this book and  in the other resissues, though I suppose Courtroom scenes are inherently  dull when viewing them. Still, in her later work, Rule is able to keep  Courtroom scenes lively. Not here!<br />Upon finishing this book, I felt quite  disappointed. It simply isn't Rule at her best. I'd have been much happier,  as an Ann Rule fan, if she'd rewritten these reissues, rather than dredging  them up from the past.<br />I found this a really  mediocre read, though I  surely wouldn't want to encounter Harvey in a dark alley. I wouldn't want  to encounter Harvey in a brightly-lit alley, either. One of my major  thoughts while reading this was, &quot;I hope to God Minnesota has changed  their felonly conviction laws.&quot;<br />I don't recommend this book...not  even to Ann Rule fans.	2000-06-10

But, in any case.... I hadn't noticed the publication date (and I'm not sure why I  hadn't) when I began reading this book. While I certainly am not an expert  and can't speak to whether or not Dr. Norris's research was well done, I   noticed as I was reading that so much that was new when this book was  written is really standard and even old-hat now. It was apparent that the  FBI's Behavioral Sciences Unit was not yet well known, that extensive study  into serial killing had not yet reached the peak that it has now. I found  it disconcerting to read views of the science of forensics that were  actually developed eleven years ago, since I would imagine that the science  of forensics has grown by leaps and bounds in that time...and that insight  into serial killers' minds has come a long way since 1989. While reading  this book, I found myself constantly wondering what the author  might say  if he'd written this, say, in 1999. For these reasons, I would not  recommend this book.	2000-06-04

I am going through another one of my &quot;true crime&quot; phases; my last phase was in the early to mid-80's, and this one has me buying every true crime book Amazon sells!  I say this as context because no matter how  many true crime books I read, Ann Rule always comes up on top in terms of  authors and in terms of my interest in the book. She's really an artist in  this genre. When reading this book, as with all of Ms. Rule's books, I  sometimes had to counsel myself to be patient and slow down. Rule has a bit  of Stephen King in her, and so her writing can be dense, words and details  often packed as tightly  as sardines in a tin. Unlike King, however, Rule  never wastes a word. I have read so many true crime books with fascinating  topics and such poor writing (and editing) that dramatic crime cases become  dull. Not in this case!  In this book, Rule is at her best. Her eye for  detail and her exceptional skill at recreating the drama of the crime and  the courtroom are at full tilt in Small Sacrifices. Her  background/historical detail here is exquisitely done and incredibly  thorough. This is probably my favorite Ann Rule book so far. I simply could  not put it down, reading it in all manner of unlikely places! I imagine  it's obvious that I highly recommend this book!	2000-06-04

Thinking I'd purchased simply a true crime book, I was astonished to find that this book weaves the later career of Eliot Ness with politics in Cleveland in the l930's and 1940's with the unkown identity of a gruesome  serial killer at that time. The author's sense of time and place is  terrific. I was swept back to that time in history, almost against my will.  And I found this to be far more horrifying a book than it appears. When I  was two-thirds of the way done, I found that I absolutely had to close and  lock my bedroom window. These crimes may have been committed before I was  born, but they're still shocking and terrifying. See if you agree with me  that Eliot Ness's take on who committed these crimes is the right one!   Horrifying, historical, accurate, mesmerizing, all at once. I recommend it  to anyone interested in terrific reading.	2000-05-21

A supposed highlight of this true crime book is that Ted Bundy turned Jimmy Rode on to the classified ads as a means of finding women victims. There is absolutely nothing in this book that would indicate Rode ever met  Bundy....and absolutely nothing about want ads...unless I went into a  trance while I was reading it. I found Lasseter's book very  middle-of-the-road in terms of true crime books. I found it neither  frightening nor informative. Rather, it proceeded from criminal stage to  the courtroom without a moment of my heart stopping. Lasseter's approach to  this case is, while thorough, boring and dispassionate.

First, I was amazed, in reading this book, that I only came across one editorial error, quite startling in true crime, don't you think? The story King write about leaves more questions than it answers. Though part of the  subtitle is, &quot;Businessman. Family Man. Savage Murderer,&quot; at no  time does King give us an iota of insight into the killer's relationship  with his child, his wife, his parents, or any siblings.  In the instance of  the killer's child, the child is put off so far into the distance that we  don't even know if the child is male or female. Short shrift is also made  of King's relationship with his wife. We get absolutely  not an inkling  about what that relationship might have been like. And what about his  relationship with his parents? His extended family? Were there siblings?   And &quot;businessman?&quot; I would think that would connote a  white-collar worker, not a small parts repairman. More than the lack of  depth into its chief characters, I was distrubed by the totally neutral and  dispassionate tone King uses when describing such brutal crimes. I got more  of a chill down my spine over King's distanced view than from the crimes  themselves. I found the lack of information about the killer himself most  off-putting. Once we learn that the killer refused to speak to authorities,  we never hear from him...or much about him...again. I'd have to say that as  far as excellent true crime goes, this is a really mediocre read.	2000-04-20

Though this book still has John Douglas's usual pat on his own back all through it, it's truly a terrifying read.<br />The only unfortunate part of the book is Douglas's rehash of the Simpson case (yawn), and his showing us how he'd profile the killer is a big bore.....and it's in here because John  Douglas likes to talk about how good he is (and I'm sure he is....but the  man has an ego problem).<br />Aside from that profile, the reading is so scary  that I couldn't sleep, and as far as true crime books, that rarely happens  to me.<br />It's an excellent read, and gives some worthy &quot;tips&quot; as  far as your own self-preservation, and the safety of your children.<br />In  spite of Douglas himself, I enjoyed this book almost too much. I was afraid  to go in front of my windows for days! <br />Absolutely worth buying and  reading...	2000-04-02

When detailing the crimes, they become rather coy and worried about being overly sensational. I appreciate that many books become  lurid in their description of crimes, but Harrington and Burger are almost  shy in their description.<br />The real mass of the book is an endless litany  about how long it takes to get Ng to trial, and in fact, the trial hasn't  even begun when this book ends. The authors endlessly quote sources, to the  point that the reader just wants to cry.<br />I am still trying to figure-out  the reason for this book. It basically tells the reader nothing, and  doesn't inform in any way.<br />Don't waste your money.	2000-03-27

In HULA, while Lisa Shea captures a child's voice with excellence, there is just no point to this book in the end. Rather, it is just a descriptive piece, and  the reader learns nothing more from having read this book.<br />I think Shea  is big on style and short on substance. I found this book simply a display  of Shea's writing skills, rather than anything  monumental. There are so  many fantastic books about childhood, such as LIAR'S CLUB and THE MONKEY  KING (Patricia Chao) that this little book did nothing at all for me.	2000-02-04

I'm beginning to really wonder if anyone besides Ann Rule can write a true crime book well. <br />Apparently the author has the beginnings of Alzheimer's, because she repeats and repeats the same  material to the point that it is work reading this book.<br />The author has  good intentions, wanting to fill the read in on background material of the  victims' lives and the murderer's life, but as a reader, one has to wonder  how she knows what all of these various people have said in their lives.  Did she attach a tape recorder to each of them prior to the murders?<br />On  top of her repetitiveness, by the time I got to page 199 (yes, page 199!)  and the background material was finally over, I was exhausted from reading  the book and had no interest in finishing it.<br />It's certainly admirable to  give some background information, which is often lacking in true crime  books.

But I was  utterly wrong. <br />This is really Ann Rule's best book yet, and one of the  best books I've ever read in true crime.	2000-01-06
US	51837401	RUMTI6VSDK5WR	0380731649	438241163	Just Desserts: Martha Stewart the Unauthorized Biography	Books	3	12	25	N	N	Martha Stewart as compared to Hitler	Jerry Oppenheimer (sniff, sniff) states that he just happened to choose Martha Stewart as a subject, and just sort of fell into such incredibly negative news about her that, from what he states, poor Martha is pure  evil. Since we all know totally evil persons, including Hitler and Charlie  Manson, it is quite beyond me why Martha is chosen to play the  &quot;completely bad guy&quot; from Oppenheimer's point of view.<br />This  book catalogued every single negative thing that Oppenheimer could dig-up.  There is apparently, according to this book, not one saving grace for  Martha Stewart, other than that she gets done what she wants done.  <br />Before I go on, I should tell you that when my local NBC-affiliate took  on Martha Stewart's television show as a one-hour program, I nearly  croaked, right there on my immaculate kitchen floor. It is beyond me who  sees anything particularly amazing about this somewhat demented woman, who  obviously has obsessive-compulsive disorder. To me, Martha is someone with  such a relaxed and droning voice that she invokes immediate sleep.<br />So the  best and worst about Martha are, I believe, that she's a great sleep aid  and should be prescribed at sleep disorders clinic.<br />At the same time that  we can ask what all the positive broohaha is about a woman who makes teeny  tiny things to eat, we also have to ask....well, I have to anyway....what  on earth could possess Oppenheimer to cast her as this evil witch, with  absolutely no good reason, at least as Oppenheimer sees her, to be on this  earth at all?<br />What is his rage about? Is he jealous of her?<br />Her  husband, Andy, throughout the book, is  portrayed as this wimpy guy who's  been verbally slapped around for over 20 years of marriage. The villainess  is Martha. Doesn't it occur to anyone that it takes two to make a marriage,  and that there is something exceptionally wrong with a man like Andy, who  doesn't dump a shrew after three years of that marriage? I don't buy it.  Andy took any abuse he received quite willingly, and if I were he, I'd be  mortified to be portrayed as a child-like victim.<br />It didn't strike  me as  at all unusual, given this whole book, that the majority of Oppenheimer's  &quot;Notes and Sources,&quot; specifically, &quot;Sources,&quot; come from  &quot;informed source,&quot; or that those with something really terrible  to say really, really wanted to get it all said. &quot;Informed  sources?&quot; I'd be most ashamed to list that as more than one or two  resources in any kind of book I'd write (not that I'm going to be or have)  such as this.<br />I overrated this book as #3 for only two reasons: that when  Martha's television show came on today, I was much more observant of Martha  than I'd ever been. In fact, I was able to stay awake beyond  my usual  Martha time of about 5 minutes or less. (I'm home recovering from major  back surgery, which may explain my having even the time to have the  television on during the day.) The second reason was that in spite of the  totally nutty , and even offensive, tone of this book, it was as much fun  as reading a tabloid magazine, for someone who is bedridden.	1999-10-07

I had to smile sadly when I read someone's review for this book; they were upset that others had &quot;slammed&quot; it. I know it's upsetting when one reads a book they love, and then finds that others dislike it. I'm  afraid I'm one of the slammers.<br />After RED DRAGON and SILENCE OF THE  LAMBS, I thought this book was just dreadful. What amazed me is that Harris  had apparently waited eleven years to write this dismal performance. I  bought this book before it was on the Bestseller list, and buying books in  hardback is really a luxury for me, so just let me say that this was an  EXPENSIVE disappointment.<br />The first 55 chapters were background. How  utterly dull. And the chapters on Hannibal in Italy sounded like a  traveloque, complete with &quot;Italian words&quot; dropping. It's worse  than name-dropping to drop as many unfamiliar words AND types of wines as  Harris did in this novel.  If I'd wanted that, I'd have purchased UNDER THE  TUSCAN SUN. By the time I'd arrived at chapter 55 and could see that  FINALLY some action was coming, I was already utterly disgusted, and not  one bit surprised that in the &quot;Acknowledgements.&quot; the majority  went to experts on Italian life and culture.<br />I suppose it's hard to make  a cannibal very scary after Jeffrey Dahmer, but if he was attempting to  make Lecter frightening, Harris failed terribly.<br />When I'd finished the  book, I hardly knew what to think. The ending was so incredibly  implausible.  Apparently, Mr. Harris had decided to write a travelogue with  a fairytale ending.<br />The whole time I read this book, in my mind was the  fact that long before it was written, or at least published, the stars of  SILENCE OF THE LAMBS had already publicized their interest in doing a  sequel. Obviously, it was on Harris's mind as well. This read like a 1930's  version of a horror story. Where were the dancers?	1999-09-04
US	51837401	R10G0ZYSDMZIZI	067100669X	497900237	Tears of Rage	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A moving account of every parent's worst nightmare.	Though John Walsh does talk in a somewhat staccato-like tone, I'd hardly compare him to the barely speaking Jack Webb. The first portion of the book led me to dislike John Walsh somewhat, with his constantly praising  himself. I expected he'd have an ego as large as John Douglas, and that, if  he looked in a mirror, he'd say, &quot;Wow, handsome!&quot; As the book  progressed, however, I could see that this was a literary device for  showing a man who thought he was invincible, faced with a tragedy no one of  us as parents even wants to imagine. Though the last chapter or two dragged  in terms of literary merit, in the bulk of the book,  John Walsh did a  remarkable job of telling a devastating story with an enormous amount of  integrity, restraint and passion. This is the only true crime reading I've  ever done where I wept while reading the book. Walsh's account of his  beloved, small son, and his devastating tale of that child's remains, will  haunt me always. While here is a man who turned tragedy into saving the  lives of countless children, his unbearable pain is evident throughout. One  has the knowledge that this family will never get over the horrid, ghastly  and oh-so-tragic loss of Adam Walsh's descriptions of the first hours after  Adam was abducted are so horrifying, I stayed awake, just watching my son,  long after I'd finished the book..  I found this an enormously brave and  courageous book.	1999-06-23
US	51837401	R23XWH1VEVOHTO	0306459809	325568552	Profiles In Murder	Books	3	10	13	N	Y	A very average profiling study	This book started out with what I found kind of a stagey premise....with Vorpagel &quot;teaching&quot; a class of profiling students. There were some moments of interesting reading, but suddenly, in the final quarter of  the book, Vorpagel and Harrington suddenly veered directly off the track of  murder and profiling and went into two incredibly boring stories that had  nothing to do with profiling at all. I'm beginning to wonder if anything is  being written anymore, as far as forensic profiling, that says anything  new. And I am also puzzled by the sheer number of these books lately that  have veered far afield of their supposed topics. I found this a VERY  average book.	1999-06-17
US	51837401	R2358KYTJE0QP3	0312198779	529724691	The Evil That Men Do: FBI Profiler Roy Hazelwood's Journey into the Minds of Sexual Predators	Books	2	31	39	N	Y	A lukewarm book that doesn't fit its title	I'm a huge fan of true crime and forensic science. However, I found this book seriously disappointing.....particularly since I bought it in hardbound!!! I can't count the number of times in this book that I sighed  in disappointment,since suddenly, the book would shift to a chapter that  had absolutely no connection with the subtitle of this book, &quot;FBI  Profiler Roy Hazelwood's Journey into the Minds of Sexual Predators.&quot;  In fact, there wasn't much about sexual predators until the final chapters.  And........Stephen Michaud, who wrote this book, tends to cover topics in  such brevity that it leaves the reader wondering, &quot;And? And?&quot; I  think the problem here is Stephen Michaud. He stinks as a writer. I'm sure  Roy Hazelwood's career has been fascinating, and it's unfortunate that he  chose Michaud as his author of choice. There were so many grammatical  errors in the first third of this book that I simply couldn't imagine why  Michaud was thanking his editor. For me, particularly in a hardbound, such  carelessness just drives me nuts. All-in-all, I found this book to be a  major disappointment and the single most dull book I've read in true  crime/forensic science.	1999-06-05
US	51837401	RGTRZ0YLXA6SF	0671528904	133073868	Mind Hunter: Inside the FBI's Elite Serial Crime Unit	Books	5	14	17	N	N	An excellent read	Though everyone who's read this book has to have  noticed that there are more than enough references to Mr. Douglas's obviously high opinion of himself, I found this book so impactful that, as a licensed social worker,  I've decided to alter the focus of my career to, and add some education in,   forensic work. That says a lot about this book! I've never read anything  before this that would cause me to change the entire focus of my career.   It's thorough and fascinating. There are, of course, tons of &quot;true  crime&quot; books, and I've read  many of them, but this is one of the only  books on the topic that provides a real education in forensic psychology  and profiling. Once having read this book, I was really hungry for more  education on forensic ANYTHING. I recommend it highly.	1999-05-26
