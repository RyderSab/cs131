True, many of the organizations with which Masonry has associated itself in its history (including, regrettably, the KKK) cast some doubt on Masonry.  This book, however, falls short of any type of conviction of Masonry.<br />The only bright spot in this book is that it could serve as a starting point (but no further) for anyone who wants to research the history of Masonic activities in this country.  With the historical detail given of the US in the 19th century, one could also use this book as a springboard into studying oppression against Catholics in this country.<br />But in any event, Holy Mother Church still forbids Catholics to enter into Masonic fraternities (if anyone says otherwise, please go to your favorite search engine and look up the document \\"Quaesitum Est\\"), and that being the case, we ought not join them.<br />Too general to be conclusive.  Two stars only.	2004-02-01

Mr Lewis seems to be pointing out some of the subtle ways that a &quot;demon&quot; could undermine our faith, turning us away from Christ and toward damnation.<br />The general lesson of this book would seem to be the eternal vigilance that the Christian needs in combatting evil.<br />Five stars.	2004-02-01

The chapters start out in the question-and-answer format that those who are familiar with the Baltimore Catechism will recognize, and continues with easy-to-read text on the subject of that chapter.  At 40 chapters, one short chapter per day, this book could make an excellent six-week course on the Catholic Faith.<br />In reading through the pages of this book, all I found was orthodox magisterial Catholic teaching, and none of the modernism that infests our Church today.  It is written in very readable language, and would make a great first book to read on the faith.  Commandments, Sacraments, Disciplines, everything is presented here.<br />Well worth the price.

So, Ms. Faludi, what exactly is the definition of \\"backlash\\"???  I would gather, according to your book, that backlash would be anything that does not promote your personal agenda, whatever that agenda may be, and whether that agenda is an honorable one, or not.<br />The amount of statistics you use is most impressive.  Should I believe your statistics, or those of your opponents?  I guess you would have me believe it depends on what side one is on.<br />\\"Aliens\\" is, according to the author, part of the backlash, because Lt Ripley (played by Sigourney Weaver), motivated by those terrible \\"maternal instincts\\" saves a little girl from a horrible alien monster.<br />\\"Fatal Attraction\\" is also part of the backlash for two reasons (at least):<BR>1) Alex (Glenn Close) gets herself into a sexual relationship with Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas) for the unacceptable purpose of procreating.<BR>2) Beth Gallagher (Anne Archer) is the one who finally kills Alex for the un-modern, un-feminist reason of defending her family.<br />Ms. Faludi, you need to learn that there is a considerable difference between conjecture and proof; between a denial and a refutation.  You insist on so many rights, as though a person is supposed to merely assume that those rights are warranted simply because you want them, and anybody who disagrees with you is part of the \\"backlash\\" against women.<br />I like books that invite a person to think and to reason; I do not like books that merely fan ones own flames of discontent.  It is a book like this that discredits the genuine inequalities and atrocities that exist in society today, and instead tries to push a definition of what exactly a woman should be.	2004-02-01

It is filled with Earl Strom's own perspectives on the game, the business, and the industry of professional basketball, and these perspectives are well worth reading.<br />A person who spent parts of five separate decades in the NBA is certainly going to have a lot of stories to tell about life on the road, the pressures of the job, the pressures on family due to extensive travel, and so on.  Many, though I am sure not all, of Earl Strom's stories appear here.<br />The author also adds some little pieces of advice for the prospective referee.  Here is one really good one:<br />&quot;I've known guys who started out strong and were courageous enough to make tough calls against the home team late in the game if they had to be made, but you could see them change as the players and the coaches and the fans got to them.  'Why bring the house  down on my head?  Why get killed for something nobody really appreciates anyway?'  I've had guys say that to me.  If you ever stop to say, 'What's going to happen to me if I make this call?' you might as well take your whistle and shove it because that's all the respect you're giving it.  I was taught from the beginning, and it has stuck with me through all these years, that it's much easier to fight your way out of a place than to have to go look in the mirror and admit you backed down from a tough call.&quot;  (pp 31-32)<br />With only a little bit of a down side, I would call this a pretty decent book.  Four stars.	2004-02-01

Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood	Books	5	18	24	N	N	The reasons for the "contrived" priest shortage - and more!	In an informative and well-written book, Michael Rose has given what is, to date, the best reasons for the present priesthood crisis.<br />The author claims that the reason we have a shortage of priests (at least, in many dioceses) is because for many years qualified candidates in those dioceses have been turned away.  He claims that those who hold true to the authentic magisterial teachings of Holy Mother Church are, in those places, rejected in favor of men who oppose Her, especially in teachings concerning homosexuality, celibacy, an all-male priesthood, divorce, and contraception.  This predictably has resulted in scandals, heterodox teachings from the pulpit, and less reverence in our houses of worship and in our liturgies.<br />He further claims that the reason qualified candidates are rejected is because those who would want to overthrow Holy Mother Church have made their way into powerful positions in many (but certainly not all) dioceses and seminaries, including many bishops.  These people have in turn become \\"gatekeepers\\"; filtering out the qualified candidates and welcoming the unqualified.  The stories that some of his interviewees tell about what goes on in heterodox seminaries are incredible.<br />The author has hit the nail right on the head with this book.  It does not take a genius to see that the overall quality of our priests has gone down significantly in the last 30 or so years, and that the quality of the liturgy and the reverence shown by the faithful has gone down with it (but make no mistake - there are still plenty of faithful, reverent Catholics out there, and faithful priests and bishops who maintain loyalty to Rome; they are just getting fewer and further between).<br />And the answer the author proposes to this crisis is just so obvious; any faithful Catholic could tell you.  More orthodox Catholicism, NOT LESS!  We do not need to trash Vatican II; that council did not encourage disobedience and irreverence - rather, it reaffirmed them.<br />An excellent book - five stars easily.	2003-06-17

The result has been a departure from the vertical worship of true liturgy to the horizontal worship of modernism, indifferentism, Americanism, and naturalism.  Naturally this departure does not only manifest itself in liturgical abuses, but also in doctrinal abuses (contradicting the Church's stand on birth control, homosexuality, abortion; preaching heresy from the pulpit; inviting blatantly anti-Catholic speakers to speak at Catholic retreats and seminars).<br />The book gives the best possible advice for those who really want to understand why the quality of our liturgy has declined so terribly in the last few decades; read the Bible, the Catechism, the Vatican II conciliar documents, and the Code of Canon Law; confront (respectfully) the priests who are committing liturgical abuses (I say respectfully because some of them are heretics, while others may truly not know that something they are doing is actually an abuse); confront the bishop; and if necessary, write the Vatican.<br />I give this book five stars.  I was considering only four, since the English usage is so bad.  This book is an example of why a good proofreader is necessary and a spell checker is not enough (\\"form\\" instead of \\"from\\"; \\"principal\\" instead of \\"principle\\"; etc.).	2003-03-23

This is the first of Hilaire Belloc's books that has left me somewhat bewildered.  I really do not know what I think about it.<br />One thing I can say, however, is that it has given me a greater admiration for the Middle Ages, which Hilaire Belloc calls the height of civilization.  Over the centuries the slavery was replaced by serfdom, and later, in the Middle Ages, by the free peasantry.  Indeed they worked out a meager living, but they were truly independent, either by owning productive land, or by being members of a trade guild.  Their minds were not focused on greed.  They lived simple, fruitful, and (for many of them, at least) holy lives.<br />But then the protestant rebellion changed all that.  The Church was looted.  Usury became a widespread practice.  Money became all-important.  Widespread slavery returned (especially on the American continent - and backed by the slave owners' private interpretation of Scripture, of course!).  And now, today, very few people own productive land, thus the &quot;proletariat&quot; (people who have no productive property and nothing to sell but their services) has grown.  And let us not forget the protestant preachers and their &quot;Health and Wealth&quot; gospel!<br />So while making some interesting historical points it seems that Mr Belloc is against big business.  But we are no longer a nation of farmers.  We build products today (automobiles, airplanes, complex machines, electronics, rockets, etc.) that could not be built efficiently in &quot;Mom and Pop Shops.&quot;  Are we to do away with technology, like the Unabomber suggests?  (shudder!)<br />I give this book four stars.  I finished reading it months ago, but I must admit I am stumped by it.  It is good reading, though, and I encourage you to read it for yourself.	2003-03-23

The movie is a comedy which successfully captures the spirit of this book, but this book is not a comedy.<br />The authors do an excellent job of developing the characters by telling how they rose to their respective positions at this focal point, and telling the story as it unfolds.<br />It is like all of the worst traits of humanity - greed, ego, pride, vanity, a hunger for power and conquest and victory - are played out in this true story of the LBO (Leveraged BuyOut) of RJR Nabisco.  Companies being tossed around like commodities, while the little guy who works hard to make a living suffers.<br />This is the only book I have read on this subject to date.  Some of the other reviewers have suggested other titles, and many of them are probably worth reading as well.<br />Five stars.	2003-03-23

This is what the author does - he cites the very words of the man whom protestants have come to love and admire.<br />When he is not quoting Luther, he is much more often than not quoting Luther's closest associates, followers, and even protestant historians. I really get the impression that the vast majority of protestants - including present-day Lutherans - do not really know much about Martin Luther.<br />And so, for the Catholic, it will show you the novel beliefs of this very rebellious man. The author even goes to great length to present the Catholic response to these teachings, and in very readable language.<br />For the protestant, this book will make you think; it will present to you teachings of Luther in Luther's own words - teachings that you will have to answer for, since you hold this man in such high esteem. You will have to answer for why this man held morality in such low esteem, why this man instructed followers to not even try to \\"be perfect, as our Father in heaven is perfect\\", why and on whose authority this man abridged the Bible, why this man hated chastity and approved of divorce, bigamy, and polygamy, and a host of other teachings.<br />I find most interesting that Martin Luther was unable to even have a civil conversation with a person who disagreed with him, resorting to personal insults, \\"ad hominem\\" attacks, and obscenity as a matter of course. These things impede real dialogue between Catholics and protestants even today. You don't think so? Well then, I direct your attention to some of the reviewers who bombed this book. Their tactics speak for my truth;<br />How about John L. Hoh's (WELS) review on 2/6/2001. The first words in his review are, \\"I haven't read this book ...\\" I understand, Mr Hoh. The book is Catholic; you are a Lutheran; therefore the book MUST be bad. One should at thevery least read the book before reviewing it, if for no reason other than respect for the truth.<br />How about the reader from Milwaukee review on 6/6/2000. He criticizes the book because it has \\" ... absolutely NO balance ...\\" Well, Mr Milwaukee, it doesn't. It is made up of mostly protestant quotes and quotes from Luther himself - very little Catholic input. We let the Lutherans do the talking, and we reprint what they said. In addition, why should the book be \\"balanced\\"? What makes you think Luther had any balance? He was about as proud and opinionated as you can get.<br />Finally, how about the reader from the Midwest review on 12/1/1998. He does not hesitate to pull out the personal insults, false accusations, and antagonistic language, calling the book \\"Papist Garbage\\", comparing it to a \\"pig wallowing\\", and running down the standard laundry list of false accusations about the popes. Tell me, Midwest; how many people do you think you are going to reach talking the way you do? What does the Bible say about faith without charity (Hint: see 1Cor 13:2).<br />An excellent book - five stars.	2003-02-03

He just tells it like it was.<br />The author, rightly so, refuses to put the blame on just a few reformers, and he also refuses to exonerate Holy Mother Church's role in this.  Reading this book made me feel like he was saying, \\"Everyone we can find who is responsible will be held responsible, whether protestant or Catholic.\\"<br />To sum up (and this is explained more fully in chapter 9), the author puts the causes of the Reformation as thus:<br />1) A \\"special, personal hatred of the Faith\\" that has existed even as far back as Calvary;<br />2) The revolt was originally and essentially a protest against the spiritual power of the clergy and the financial power of the Church's heirarchy;<br />3) The movement was provoked by the very corrupt condition into which the official Church had fallen, notably the Papal court;<br />4) A new doctrine of unquestioned right in Princes to absolute rule, helped by the weakening of the Papacy (Popes leaving Rome, rival anti-popes); and<br />5) The ability to get stinking rich by the looting of Church property.<br />A good book showing that arguments in doctrine had nearly nothing to do with the first few decades of the revolt; that the revolt was nearly purely political, and after the looting of the monasteries began, the revolt was further fueled by the chance for extreme wealth and power.<br />Another great job by a great author.

The popular \\"Left Behind\\" books and videos are based on it.<br />But this is a false doctrine, virtually unheard of before the 19th century, and based on a flawed interpretation of one passage of Scripture (1 Thess 4:17 - \\"Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.\\"). Dr Thigpen shows how this passage actually refers to an ancient practice of a large group of people coming out of a city or town to meet an approaching dignitary, and then escort him into the city. This is the interpretation held by many of the Fathers and Doctors of the Church.<br />Dr Thigpen also goes on to describe various interpretations of \\"end times\\" texts; the \\"millennium\\", including descriptions of premillennialism, postmillennialism, and amillennialism; the \\"tribulation\\", including when Christ is to come back to earth (before, during, or after the \\"tribulation\\" - pre-trib, mid-trib, and post-trib, respectively); and some styles for interpreting the book of Revelation (futurist, preterist, historicist, spiritual/idealist, progressive parallels).<br />The information is somewhat basic, but very useful.<br />And finally, belief in this - or any other - false doctrine, even if one does not consider it \\"essential\\" to their faith, is dangerous for both Christians and non-Christians. One only need look at some true-life examples of those who believed falsehoods about the end-times; the great disappointment of 1844 (many never returned to their faith) is but one example. Fatal examples would be the Jonestown mass suicide, the Branch Davidians, and the Heaven's Gatesuicide. All of these people were fooled by one magnetic, charismatic leader who had his own ideas.<br />But this is the danger that anyone who stands outside of Christ's infallible Magisterium faces, and this is the danger in believing a lie - any lie - because a lie is not of the truth.<br />Well done, Dr Thigpen.	2003-01-01

The last chapter of this book (chapter 7 - \\"The Other Six Deadly Sins\\") is alone worth the purchase price; an analysis of the seven deadly sins, and how, be it grossly or subtly, we commit them every day.  This chapter can serve as a good guide for those who wish to examine their own consciences.  We tend to dismiss our own sins by comparing ourselves to those who have sinned worse, but this is not part of Christian life.  Our sins, even the small ones, adversely affect ourselves and a lot of other people.  So, it is imperative for moral Christians to, with brutal honesty, ask themselves, \\"What sins, no matter how small, am I committing?\\"<br />But then, how does one know what is and is not a sin?  That's where creed comes in.  Without a creed, a Nazi can say that it is not evil to kill Jews, and who can tell him authoritatively that he is wrong.  Without a creed, a slave-trader can say that it is OK to enslave human beings, and even use the Bible alone to justify it (as slave owners in this country did).  Who can tell him authoritatively that he is wrong?<br />It is not surprising at all to hear so many people who say that the author sounded Catholic (one reviewer even mistakenly said that she WAS Catholic); this because her views DO sound very Catholic.  This \\"call to holiness\\" is exactly what we teach, and we have a firmly established creed to follow.<br />A good book for Catholic and protestant alike.	2003-01-01

Yes, this is about as scholarly a work as you will ever read on one of the most perplexing paradoxes in all of Christian theology - the omnipotent, sovereign God versus man's free will.<br />And Father Garrigou-LaGrange explains it well in this book.  His 50-plus years of teaching at the highest levels shows itself, as the book is excellently written and the materially is expertly outlined and presented.<br />He starts with a few basic principles with which all conclusions about predestination must adhere, for example:<BR>- That God wills to save all men and that He predestines nobody to damnation<BR>- That all we have we have received from God<BR>- That God works in man to will and accomplish according to His good will, yet our will is still free<BR>- That God wills nothing that is impossible (not even His command to obey the commandments)<BR>- That no created being would be better than another if God did not will a greater good for that being (predilection)<BR>- That God is the cause of all good and the author of NO evil<BR>- and much more.<br />Then, by applying the above principles he refutes the predestination teachings of the Pelagians, Semi-Pelagians, Molinists, Jansenists, and protestants.  He follows with explanations of the Catholic (Augustinian and Thomistic) view and answers to objections.<br />But this book is not an easy read, seemingly having been written for educated people - priests, professors, and seminarians.  It is well worth your time and effort (have some aspirin ready, though, for the inevitable headaches!).<br />On a side note, this book was a pleasure to read because it is classic Catholic theology written by a great teacher in classic Catholic style - heavy on theology and light on sarcastic criticism.  Let us point out where we are right; let us explain where the others are wrong.  Let us reconcile those passages of Scripture which SEEM to contradict; let us see how, when thoroughly examined, those passages harmonize and give us God's owntruth.  Let us not, as many protestants (sadly) do, take hold of one side of the paradox, and ignore or demote the other.  It is a book like this that shows how the Catholic Church is truly Biblical on account of its acceptance of ALL Scripture as inspired; on account of its refusal to ignore or demote passages which do not fit into a pre-conceived interpretation; and its refusal to elevate one Biblical author (Paul, for example) over another or over all of the rest.<br />Five stars.	2002-10-14

A person can speak falsely only so many times before one simply says to that person, \\"I will not listen to you anymore.\\"  This is the case with Mr White.  This is the second of his books I have read (the first being \\"Is the Mormon My Brother\\"); I tell you truly, there will NOT be a third.<br />I will just touch on a few points, struggling to stay within the 1000 word limit:<br />- Page 54, where Mr White says, \\"Most protestants do not know the doctrine of sola scriptura; they merely assume it.\\"  Well, that is an arrogant boast.  Most protestants do not know their defining doctrine, but do not worry my brother protestants; Mr White will fly in like Mighty Mouse and save the day.  HE will tell all of YOU exactly what sola scriptura means, because his version of sola scriptura is right, and yours is wrong.  Funny how the Bible does not seem to speak clearly on what sola scriptura is supposed to mean, but I guess it's just one more doctrine protestants can't agree on.<br />- Pages 65 & 66, where Mr White cites the classic \\"proof text\\" (or is it, \\"prooftexted text\\"), 2Timothy 3:16-17; \\"All scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for refutation, for correction, and for training in righteousness, so that one who belongs to God may be competent, equipped for every good work.\\"  Mr White goes on to fill up a few paragraphs overintellectualizing the definitions of \\"complete\\" and \\"equip\\" (like we have absolutely no idea what these words mean), and then, on page 66, gives us a classic example of \\"Begging the Question\\" when he says, \\"Now, what does it mean that the scriptures are able fully to equip the man of God if not that they are sufficient for this task?\\"  Did you catch it?  Do you see it?  Mr White is assuming what he is trying to prove, and then using that assumption as his proof!!!  \\"complete\\" and \\"equip\\" are adjectives that apply to the MAN, not to the Scriptures; \\"profitable\\" is the adjective that applies to the Scriptures.  The Scriptures are indeed PROFITABLE in this complete equipping, but NOT SUFFICIENT, unless you remove the word \\"profitable\\" and apply \\"complete\\" and \\"equip\\" to the wrong noun!<br />- The final point I will make (but definitely NOT the final point I could make) is on page 147, where Mr White exposes his practice of using a \\"canon within the canon\\" when he says that Paul must \\"... speak first.  His Epistles to the Romans and the Galatians must define the issues, ...\\"  Whoa, guy, read 2Timothy 3:16 one more time; ALL SCRIPTURE is inspired by God and is useful, NOT JUST ROMANS AND GALATIANS!!  But this practice is what enables Mr White to tiptoe around passages that do not agree with his own theology, like Matt 19:16-22, when the rich young man asked Christ POINT BLANK the salvation question, and what was Christ's response?

This books omits the references to the Greek texts and the appendices which are in the \\"Not By\\" book.<br />But it is still an excellent book, outlined in pretty much the same format as the much larger \\"Not By\\" book (300 pages as opposed to 700).  It covers in simple, readable language the teachings of Paul, James, and Christ on the subject of justification.  It shows how all of their teachings are in perfect harmony with no need to deflate, dismiss, or outright ignore the texts which shoot \\"sola fide\\" in the heart.<br />It covers how justification is NOT a one-time event, how one's salvation CAN be lost, how Christ's righteousness is actually infused into us, not merely imputed to us, how justification is a familial restoration and not merely a courtroom decree.  It also touches on predestination, free will, final justification, \\"certain knowledge\\" of one's own salvation, and purgatory.<br />This book is sufficient to arm Catholics who wants to stand up to those who try to teach them \\"justification by faith alone.\\"  It would also be a good book for a protestant who wants to learn what the Catholic Church REALLY teaches - not necessarily what your parents and pastors TOLD you it teaches.  If you are a serious protestant who would not mind putting \\"sola fide\\" to the proof, yes, read this book.<br />Five stars!!!  If one wants a work of heavy scholarship on this subject, see also \\"Not By Faith Alone\\" by the same author.	2002-09-30

He covers the teachings of Paul, James, and Christ.  He shows how their teachings in the Holy Scriptures do not conflict at all; that when understood in the proper light, they are all in perfect harmony.<br />Learn why justification is not a one-time event;  why justification is infused righteousness and not imputed righteousness;  why justification is a familial restoration and not a courtroom decree; predestination, the role of love in salvation, and the role of works.<br />Mr Sungenis has done a magnificent job of exegesis in this book, including many explanations using the Greek texts.<br />This book makes one see \\"faith alone\\" theology for what it really is; superficial, elevating some passages of Scripture while deflating, dismissing, eisegetically misinterpreting, or outright ignoring passages of Scripture that CLEARLY refute \\"sola fide.\\"<br />This book is very long, as I said.  I encourage anyone who wants to know the truth about justification to read this book slowly.  (Another of Mr Sungenis' books, \\"How Can I Get To Heaven\\", is a simplified version of this one.  It, too, is excellent, and should perhaps be preferred by more casual readers).<br />Five stars!!!  I look forward to the rest of the \\"Not By\\" series!	2002-09-30

The story is told of a relentless search for truth that leads to the only place it could - Rome.  Scott and Kimberly expose, as do many protestant-to-Catholic conversion stories, the obstacles one encounters when considering coming home to Rome; obstacles that one does NOT face when simply changing from one protestant denomination to another, like rejection by family and shunning by friends and colleagues.<br />But the truth has a strong pull, and the truth is patient.  Perhaps that is why some conversions take many years!<br />The book does get into some of theological issues that separate Catholics from protestants, but not too deeply.  It does give a good idea and a good place to start researching, if one was so inclined.<br />I can confidently give this book five stars.  An easy story to follow.	2002-03-23

Can there be any truth in heresy?  \\"What, can the devil speak true?\\" (That's for you fans of Shakespeare's \\"Macbeth\\").<br />Yes, there is truth in heresy.  But the truth is oversimplified, exaggerated, and mixed with falsehoods.  That is what makes the heresy dangerous - heresies appeal to those who want a simpler truth (even if the truth is not so simple), and heresies hide their lies behind those truths.<br />This sets the tone for the whole book, and it also serves to make the heresies and their appeal much easier to understand.<br />After discussing heresy in general, the author goes on to describe five of the great ones (Arianism, Mohammedanism, The Albigensians, Protestantism, and The Modern Attack).  He discusses how they came to be, how they affected the contemporary world, how they still affect us today, and what the world would have been like if the heresy had prevailed.  And, his section on the Modern Attack is nothing less than prophetic, when you realize that the deteriorations he discusses, deteriorations we face in society today, he wrote about back in 1938 - a time when protestantism was just beginning to embrace artificial contraception.<br />Well, Hilaire Belloc is now my favorite author.

Our Debt to the Catholic Church	Books	4	18	25	N	N	An easy read, but few references	This book is actually two books in one; an explanation of the authentication, canonization, preservation, and translation of the Scriptures, and a personal story of conversion from Presbyterianism (the &quot;Kirk&quot;) to Catholicism.<br />The first part of the book does a magnificent job of pointing out some simple yet crucial details about the authority of Scripture - details that so-called &quot;Bible-only&quot; Christians ignore, either out of convenience or out of honest ignorance:<br />- The Bible did NOT simply fall out of the sky<br />- The Bible did NOT canonize itself (yes, some of the books in the Bible were universally accepted, but not all.  Ask yourself how those not universally accepted got into the canon, and under what authority)<br />- The Bible did NOT copy itself (this is very important, since the printing press did not exist for many centuries, and since no originals - on papyrus - exist)<br />- The Bible did NOT translate itself (this is also crucial - especially if you think that translating from one language to another is not a problem)<br />- The Bible did NOT protect itself from miscopying or mistranslation (that was also the Church's divinely-ordained function)<br />I can say that this book did strengthen my belief in the Catholic Church and its role in establishing, preserving, and teaching the Scriptures.<br />However ...<br />As I have read in some other reviews on this book, the author failed to back up many of his facts with appropriate references.  I have criticized protestant authors for this, so in all fairness and respect for truth, I must do the same here.  He speaks true, but he should back up what he says rather than expecting the reader to take his word for it.<br />The second part of the book is as good a conversion story as I have ever heard.  The author points out the obstacles that a protestant faces in his journey home to Rome; the shunning by former friends and colleagues, the disapproval of family, the need to pretty much uproot and start life anew (this is not an obstacle people often face when changing from one protestant denomination to another, it should be noted).<br />But the pull of the truth of Rome is strong, and although it took many years, Rome finally brought another of her prodigal children home.<br />The author also devotes a lot of space to refuting the protestant practice of downplaying the need for unity, as if unity means boredom, or lack of intellectual exercise.  Heck.  This is salvation we are talking about here.  God wants all people to be saved, not just the intellectuals.  If you want an intellectual challenge, take up quantum physics!<br />I give the first part only three stars, the second part five stars, so let's just say four stars.  An excellent read, well worth the price.	2002-03-18

After reading this masterpiece, it is easy to see how some would say that this book seems to be divinely inspired.  It is written in a true spirit of Christian charity and a genuine desire to make known the path &quot;to Jesus, through Mary.&quot;<br />The translation by Father Frederick Faber is so easy to follow, staying true to St. Louis' intent to, &quot;... speak particularly to the poor and simple, who being of good will, and having more faith than the common run of scholars, believe more simply and more meritoriously ...&quot; (paragraph 26).  St. Louis does indeed state the truth quite plainly.<br />And what a truth he states!  This book, so beautifully organized, covers all aspects of true Marian devotion; the necessity of Marian devotion, the truths of Marian devotion, the nature of Marian devotion, the motives of Marian devotion, the effects of Marian devotion, and the inward and outward practices of Marian devotion.  Add to that a whole appendix of prayers and litanies to aid in and practice this devotion.<br />&quot;Jesus Christ is the last end of true devotion to Mary&quot; (paragraph 61).  Absolutely!  A true devotion to Mary is indeed a straight and sure path to a deeper understanding and relationship with Christ.<br />Are you Catholic?  Do you not understand what it means to be devoted to Mary?  Read this book.  Do you believe some of your brother and sister Catholics to be too devoted to Mary?  Read this book.  Do you want to be truly devoted to Mary, but are unsure how?  Read this book.<br />Are you protestant?  Do you believe devotion to Mary to be idolatry or &quot;Mariolatry&quot;?  Read this book.  Do you believe devotion to Mary to be in opposition to devotion to Christ?  Read this book.  Do you believe &quot;Mary can't help you&quot;?  Read this book.<br />An excellent book; a must read for anyone who wants to know what true devotion to our Blessed Mother is, how it is done, why it is done, and what benefits come from it!	2001-12-30

If we Catholics continue to leave this void, then it will continue to be filled by even more falsehoods and misinformation about our faith.<br />It is time for our brother and sister protestants to know the truth about Catholicism, even if they continue to reject it.  It is time for Catholics to learn their faith more thoroughly, and to defend their faith more assertively.  We have been off the playing field for too long.<br />An excellent book which shows the errors on BOTH sides.	2001-07-29

Clearly the strength in his teaching and analysis lays in his ability to clarify the New Testament by using the Old.  In this series - as well as the others I have purchased - Professor Hahn lays out Old Testament passages that support his conclusions.<br />This is so vitally important in studying Scripture because it draws the line between reading truth out of the text (exegesis) and reading prejudices into the text (isogesis).<br />As for Professor Hahn's conclusions, they disspel the long-standing myth that James' version of justification opposes Paul's.  Using references from the Old and New Testaments, he shows that James and Paul are actually in total agreement.<br />Professor Hahn divides the bulk of James' letter into three areas based on the &quot;summary&quot; provided in James 1:19;  1) Quick to Hear (1:20 - 2:26);  2) Slow to speak (3:1 - 3:18); and  3) Slow to anger (4:1 - 5:18).<br />An easy five stars.

This book, along with Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger's &quot;Spirit of the Liturgy&quot; should be manditory reading for all Roman Catholic priests.<br />After 20 years absence from holy mother Church, I was amazed to see all of the &quot;changes&quot; in the mass; changes like omitting the Profession of Faith on Sundays, omitting the Lavabo, standing (as opposed to kneeling) during the Eucharistic Prayer, not wearing a chasuble or wearing the stole over the chasuble, holding hands during the Our Father, and so on. Was I ever surprised to learn that these were NOT accepted changes, but liturgical abuses by renegade priests!<br />This book addresses all of these abuses and much, much more. Mister Akin does a superb job of giving references for his statements on each individual abuse, whether he is quoting the GIRM (General Instructions of the Roman Missal), the Lectionary, or any other authoritative Church document pertaining to the Mass. He even gives a list of these at the beginning of the book, and most of them are easily available on the web. That makes this book an excellent study guide on the do's and don'ts of Catholic worship.<br />Some might consider this material as nothing but strict conformism, but not so. All of the symbolism in the Liturgy has meaning. The Catholic Mass does what it symbolizes, and it symbolizes what it does, so the symbolism must be performed properly.<br />Read this book and see how good a job your priest is doing. &quot;The faithful have a right to a true Liturgy ...&quot; says the Inaestimabile Donum, and it is time we started holding our priests to this!	2001-07-04

Yes, good women should give bad men their walking papers.  Yes, a woman should not feel obligated to suffer at the hands of lazy and/or abusive and/or manipulative bozos.<br />The problem I had with this book was her identification of some of the bozos.<br />I will give the one of her examples that sticks out in my mind: the retired policeman.  A man who was a police officer retired in his forties (I am assuming that this was a full retirement since the author did not say otherwise).  He was able to stay home and spend more time with the kids.  His wife did not like this, and insisted he go find a job.<br />Therein lays my problem.  This man was a police officer, one of the most strenuous jobs there is.  How many times did this man put his life on the line???  He has done his bidding for king and country!  He has earned his retirement!  If his wife doesn't understand this, perhaps SHE should join a police department!<br />Ms. Vedral, you were dead wrong in supporting the retired policeman's wife.

For one to manipulate Scripture to one's own end, one must apply eisegesis.<BR>This tape set is an example of exegesis.<BR>Scott Hahn does a magnificent job of teaching the Gospel of John, chapter by chapter, verse by verse, over these 15 tapes. In what is developing into his pattern, he explains the texts by referring to the relevant Old Testament prophecies and images. The Bread of Life discourse, the cleansing of the temple, the wedding feast, Christ's exchange with Nicodemus, and all of the other lessons and stories are made understandable and reasonable.<BR>The most impressive tape in the set is tape #14 &quot;It Is Finished.&quot; Scott does a superb job of explaining why the &quot;It&quot; uttered by Christ can not refer to His saving work here on Earth. Wasn't it St. Paul who insisted that Christ's resurrection was also necessary for our salvation? (Acts 17:3, Acts 26:23) It couldn't be finished if Christ had to rise from the dead now, could it? So what is the &quot;It&quot; Christ was talking about? Anyone familiar with Scott Hahn's article on &quot;The Fourth Cup&quot; will know.<BR>This tape set is an excellent Bible study. I am looking forward to hearing some more of Scott Hahn's lectures. meanwhile, I strongly recommend this one!! Five stars easy!!	2001-06-25

The format of the story is this:<br />A bunch of &quot;ghosts&quot; board a bus in a dreary, drizzly town which is in perpetual twilight (we later learn that this place is &quot;the valley of the shadow of death&quot;).  This flying bus takes them up to a bright (as in &quot;a minute or two before sunrise&quot;) natural setting (which we later learn is &quot;the valley of the shadow of life&quot;).  Here the narrator (presumably Lewis himself) sees how without substance the ghosts (including himself) really are.  They are not even substantial enough to bend the grass beneath their feet.  Some of them are barely visible.  They are met by &quot;spirits&quot; (each ghost has a specific spirit coming to meet him/her) who are bright and solid.<br />The narrator describes each &quot;interview&quot; he sees between ghost and spirit.  Each interview highlights a specific manifestation of pride, greed, selfishness, pettyness, manipulation - any of the sins that weigh us down.  Eventually, the narrator meets the spirit sent for him (writer George MacDonald).<br />If you read this book, you will see a lot of people you know.<br />If you read this book HONESTLY, you will find pieces of yourself as well.<br />This book is a magnificent moral story.

Frank Peretti has said some things that need to be said about the pecking orders that exist in adolescent society.  With the many school shootings, often by victims of schoolyard bullies, that have happened over the last few years, it has become painfully obvious that writing off such bullying with the time-honored excuse &quot;Boys will be boys&quot; does not hold water.<br />Mr. Peretti gives his own personal story about how cruel children can be, and how insensitive those in authority (the gym teacher was his example) can be.  The abuse that he faced was for a problem over which he had no control, not that the bullying types care.  <br />Mr. Peretti directs his book, not just at the bullies, but at those who are bullied and then do some bullying of their own.  This is the most perplexing question: how is it that those who are bullied can, knowing what it feels like, can turn around and become bullies?  This book is for the bullies and the bullied alike.<br />Unfortunately, Mr. Peretti's warning may fall on a lot of deaf ears - especially parents of such bullies.  Many fathers like their sons to be &quot;tough&quot; (you can spell it &quot;M-E-A-N&quot;), and what better way to show how &quot;tough&quot; you are than to bully those who can not or will not fight back.  They figure that the best way to not be bullied is to BECOME the bully (remember Tacitus - &quot;They terrify, lest they should fear.&quot;  How about Colonel Kurtz from &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;  -  &quot;You must make horror your friend; otherwise it is your enemy.&quot;)<br />This book is a five-star manifesto against the &quot;Social Darwinism&quot; that has become disgracefully accepted in our schools.

It is a good follow-up story to the episode &quot;Errand of Mercy,&quot; but is it guilty of the same annoying flaw as the original series and most Star Trek books - way too much focus on Kirk and Spock.<br />I give this book four stars for the story and continuity, and I take back one star for the reason stated.  (Am I the only Trekkie who feels this way about the original Star Trek?)	2000-11-29

It is bad enough that most of the 79 episodes of Star Trek focused primarily on Kirk and Spock.  That is my main #1 beef against the original TV series.  Authors who repeat and magnify that blunder make the matter worse!<br />Once again, Kirk and Spock (mostly Spock) are the main focus of attention, with the rest of the Enterprise crew functioning as no more than glorified pages and squires.  Even worse is the way Spock is charcaterized by the authors.  In this book, Spock might just as well be wearing a cape with a red &quot;S&quot; on it!<br />I read this book before ST:TNG, ST:DS9, and Voyager were made, and I despised this book then.  After enjoying the way ALL of the characters were included and developed in the three latest Star Trek series, both my love of Star Trek and my hatred of this book grew.  Enough, already!	2000-11-29

This book is written in a format which is both informative and entertaining.  After spending nearly three chapters building a defense against the modernism of the Jesus Seminar, the author, at the end of chapter three, realizes that his fundamentalism is really a form of modernism.  The following chapters show the author's reasoning dismantling the doctrines of fundamentalism, and show where the real truth was all the time - in Catholicism.<br />The book is similar to other Protestant-turned-Catholic stories, but I still unhesitatingly give it five stars because of the way the author tells the story:  he leads himself into the trap of modernism, finds the truth, and that truth leads him out of the trap.  The truth will, indeed, set you free!	2000-11-29

All too often, bridge books present hands that look as if they were &quot;set up.&quot;  In order to get the right answer, you simply eliminate the &quot;obvious&quot; play.  Not so in this book.  Kelsey's hands look like those ordinary hands you might face in your local club or home game.  Kelsey demonstrates that by thoroughly counting a hand (points, cards, tricks),  a player can much more easily arrive at the killing defense.    That's the major lesson in this book - counting, and  Kelsey does a magnificent job of teaching it!	2000-11-15
