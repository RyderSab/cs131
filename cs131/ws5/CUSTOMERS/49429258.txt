One of the real treats of this series is that unlike a lot of other mysteries with continuing characters, we've really gotten to see protagonist Rei Shimura grow and change. She started out as a callow young twentysomething; now she's nearing 30, engaged, and thinking of starting a family. This, combined with her involuntary exile from her beloved Japan, has really matured her. But an older, more grounded Rei doesn't make this book any less fun -- THE PEARL DIVER offers up a dishy look at the trendy restaurant scene, and will appeal to foodies as well as mystery fans. Rei's relationship with Hugh continues to be passionate yet stormy; and longtime fans will cheer the reappearance of Rei's beloved Aunt Norie. This book stands on its own, but will be particularly treasured by fans who have followed Rei's adventures throughout this engaging series.	2004-08-03

Could Tyler authentically write a male voice? Indeed, I found the character totally believable and it was one of my all-time favorite Tyler books. Now Sara Lewis, an author who reminds me a bit of Tyler, has done the same thing with THE BEST OF GOOD. It's written from the first-person point of view of Tom Good, a musician whose traumatic past has led him to live an almost cloistered life until a shocking surprise helps draw him out of his shell.<br />I don't want to give away too much detail about the plot, since the book has a lot of twists &amp; turns -- it's the kind of novel I found hard to put down because I wanted to know what would happen next! I really got caught up in Good's story, and found him to be a flawed but likable character -- the kind of guy you root for.<br />The one issue I have with Lewis's books -- and this was also very true of SECOND DRAFT OF MY LIFE, her most recent novel before GOOD -- is that the author obviously loves her protagonists so much that by the end of her books, it's almost as if she feels sorry about all the things she's put them through and gives them fairy-tale endings that just seem a little too good to be true (no pun intended). However, Lewis continues to be one of my favorite contemporary novelists, and THE BEST OF GOOD is, indeed, one of her best books.	2003-12-11

I decided to remedy that, and his latest book, CHASING THE DIME, looked like a good old-fashioned page-turner. Once you get past the set-up, it succeeds as a fun, fast-paced read. Henry Pierce is the founder & owner of a nanotechnology firm that is racing to patent a revolutionary new application before its many rivals, and to find an investor who is willing to sink millions into the company. Pierce is a genius, but his project is jeopardized by his growing fascination with a missing prostitute -- he was assigned her old phone number when he moved, and becomes intrigued when callers keep asking for \\"Lilly.\\" The story is a classic noir in that an innocent man finds himself sinking deeper and deeper into an underworld of crime, murder and mayhem. The resolution is a bit far-fetched, and if you're not interested in the technology, prepare to do a lot of skimming. But on the whole, this is a slick, enjoyable thriller, and I definitely plan on reading more Connelly in the future.	2002-12-11

This is a real \\"audio play,\\" performed by a full cast and including sound effects and even original musical numbers. Broadway actress Susan Egan, the voice of heroine/narrator Katy Green, is a delight, and the '40s setting is nicely evoked. While I enjoy regular audiobooks read by one person, I wish there were more full-cast productions like this one -- the only similar mystery audio plays I've been able to find are a couple of Ross MacDonald's books (SLEEPING BEAUTY and THE ZEBRA-STRIPED HEARSE). Books on tape have become a huge market and it would be nice to see publishers try something different than the usual one-reader approach. Bravo to Hal Glatzer and Audio Playwrights for daring to break the mold with this excellent production.	2002-12-01

However, P IS FOR PERIL was a big letdown -- the only Grafton book so far where I kept putting the book down out of boredom, and the ending was terrible. Luckily, Q IS FOR QUARRY is incredibly good, confirming my hope that P was just a fluke. Kinsey is a far more enthusiastic sleuth than she was in P, teaming up with two retired police detectives to find the identity of a long-dead Jane Doe. This book is full of great procedural work, the traditional sly and deadpan Millhone quips and observations, and yes, a real ending. I took it on vacation and read it in two days, enjoying every page of this lengthy book. Now, needless to say, I'm eagerly awaiting R!!	2002-11-29

I liked GOOD IN BED, but with IN HER SHOES, Jennifer Weiner has become one of my favorite writers. Yes, this book is not quite as light and frothy as GIB, but to me, that shows that Weiner is a versatile writer who's not going to keep writing the same book over and over again. Both of the main characters (Rose and Maggie) grew and changed during the course of the book, and learned a lot about themselves and about each other. Even though Maggie can be extremely unlikable at some points in the book, I thought Weiner did an excellent job of explaining what made her act out. Growing up without a mom AND in the shadow of a &quot;perfect&quot; big sister must be extremely difficult; I had a lot of sympathy for Maggie, even when she behaved badly.<br />I also thought the older characters were very well-drawn. And if you're a dog lover, you'll be happy to know that dogs play an important role in this book (Nifkin, from GOOD IN BED, even turns up for a cameo!). Hooray for Jennifer Weiner -- she's obviously one of the most gifted young authors around.	2002-10-15

I'll admit that I'm an unabashed Sara Lewis fan, and was thrilled to see that she had a new book out. SECOND DRAFT OF MY LIFE is sure to delight readers of her previous titles, and should attract new fans as well (these lucky folks will have three other novels and a book of short stories to catch up on!).<br />The heroine of the book is Charlotte Dearborn, a talented but unsuccessful author whose novels got great reviews, but never caught on with the general public. Finally, Charlotte declares that she's through writing fiction (AND through with her unsupportive boyfriend). She gets a job teaching grade school. The book is primarily about her trials and tribulations as a teacher. While I've never been a teacher, Charlotte's ups and downs in the classroom seemed amazingly true to life. She also crosses paths with a number of potential Mr. Rights who all seem to turn into Mr. Wrongs.<br />SECOND DRAFT doesn't sugarcoat Charlotte's despair -- in fact, it's a pretty dark book compared to the much more lighthearted THE ANSWER IS YES and BUT I LOVE YOU ANYWAY. If there's a flaw, it's that the ending seems TOO upbeat compared to what has come before, and I didn't quite buy it. However, if you're looking for a fun summer read that's well-written as well as just plain entertaining (according to the bio at saralewis.com, the author has written for the New Yorker AND Mademoiselle!), check out SECOND DRAFT OF MY LIFE.	2002-04-24
US	49429258	R22LZQ1VKQQN0R	0312282060	757947270	Murphy's Law (A Molly Murphy Mystery) (Molly Murphy Mysteries)	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Promising start to a new series	Rhys Bowen's Evan Evans mysteries are fun but a little tooooo cozy for my tastes. I love historical mysteries, though, so I figured I'd try her new series featuring Molly Murphy. MURPHY'S LAW is a light, breezy read -- I got through it in two sittings. The depiction of Ellis Island and New York in the early 1900s is nicely done; you can really picture in your mind what it must have been like to arrive at the crowded immigration center, and then to make your way into the even-more-crowded, bustling streets where most newcomers to America lived in shabby tenements.<br />Bowen provides her heroine with a very good motivation to try to find who killed an Irishman at Ellis Island -- Molly is initially accused of the crime, and then a friend of hers becomes a suspect and is held in prison. Molly has a strong desire not to get in trouble with the law; she murdered a wealthy landowner in Ireland (albeit in self-defense), and would hang if she were deported back to her home country.<br />The end of the book neatly sets up the possibility of sequels, as Molly decides to become a detective of sorts. I'm a little concerned about her budding romance with a police detective -- that's so cliche! -- but I'll definitely be looking forward to the second Molly Murphy mystery.	2001-11-12

Cannie is such a fully-realized character, it's hard to believe she only exists on the pages of this book. High praise indeed for first-time author Jennifer Weiner.<br />The only reason I'm giving this book four stars instead of five is because some of the stuff that happens here is just TOO far-fetched, particularly (as many other readers have mentioned) Cannie's friendship with a movie star. Some of the Hollywood stuff made me cringe. It seemed a little too fairy tale/wish fulfillment for my tastes. At least Cannie didn't wind up having a torrid affair with the movie star she flirts with.<br />But there's much more to the book than that subplot, and the more &quot;realistic&quot; parts of the book are simply wonderful. The &quot;diet doc&quot; who falls for Cannie is so charming, and I thoroughly enjoyed many of the other supporting characters, particularly her dog Nifkin. As a dog lover myself, I am always happy to come across a good fictional portrait of a dog. The last 80 pages or so of the book had me in tears! I hope there's a sequel, because I think there's a lot more that could be explored, such as what happens with Cannie's screenplay, and I'd love to see more of her sister, too--she seemed like a particularly interesting &amp; fun character.<br />This would be the perfect book to read on an airplane, or just anytime you need a pick-me-up. Good In Bed is good stuff.	2001-11-10
US	49429258	R2CMFNGSOM9ZPW	0786706503	486462964	Beyond the Grave (Pronzini, Bill)	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Double your fun when Pronzini and Muller team up	The best thing about being a Marcia Muller and Bill Pronzini fan is that there always seems to be a book by one of them that I somehow missed. Sure, I've read every Sharon McCone and Nameless Detective novel, their short story collections, and many of Pronzini's stand-alones; however, these married authors have written and edited DOZENS of books, including many that are out of print. What a treasure trove for the discerning reader of suspense!<br />As far as I can determine, Muller and Pronzini have collaborated on three novels: LIGHTHOUSE, a stand-alone thriller; DOUBLE, a Nameless/McCone mystery; and BEYOND THE GRAVE, featuring two of the authors' lesser-known series characters, Muller's art museum director Elena Oliverez and Pronzini's late-19th-century San Francisco detective John Quincannon. As in DOUBLE, the authors alternate -- first, we get a few chapters told from Oliverez's point of view, and then we switch to Quincannon. What makes this collaboration noteworthy is that the Quincannon chapters take place in 1894, Oliverez's in the 1980s.<br />Oliverez has bought a Mexican wedding chest at auction for her art museum, and when she's examining it, she finds an old report written by Quincannon inside a hidden compartment. He had been on the trail of some lost religious artifacts, but apparently was never able to find them. By using Quincannon's report, Oliverez hopes to recover the valuable pieces. In the process of searching, both characters encounter murder and face danger.<br />The story flows seamlessly between past and present. While these may be the authors' second-string characters, this book is definitely never second rate.	2001-10-31

Ruth Reichl does that here -- obviously a lot of people were upset by her revelations of extramarital affairs (and don't forget, her first husband played around even more than she did), but she is honest with her readers, and I admire that.<br />I was a big fan of Reichl's first volume of memoirs, TENDER AT THE BONE, and this continuation of her story captivated me from start to finish with its beautifully written accounts of great meals, wonderful chefs (including Hollywood star Danny Kaye), and Reichl's personal ups and downs. I loved the chapters set in exotic locales like China, Thailand and Spain, as well as the stories about Wolfgang Puck and Alice Waters. The story ends with Reichl's pregnancy as she is living in L.A. and working as the restaurant critic for the Los Angeles Times. Obviously much has happened since then, including her stints as a reviewer for the New York Times and her current position as editor of Gourmet magazine. That leads me to hope that there will be a third volume of memoirs before too long -- I can't wait!	2001-10-29

BURNING DOWN THE HOUSE is unlike any mystery I've read before. Audaciously, Lev Raphael dares to leave plenty of loose ends hanging at the end of the book. This is a novel that asks many more questions than it answers. And considering that it'll probably be at least a year until the next Nick Hoffman novel appears, that's bound to frustrate a lot of fans.<br />Despite that, however, I still relished the opportunity to spend several hours in the company of some of my favorite characters in all of mystery fiction. I laughed out loud MANY times while reading about the academic wackiness that is such a hallmark of Raphael's work. I drooled over the delicious food descriptions that are another staple of this series.<br />This is NOT the book that a newcomer to this series should start with (go back to the beginning and read them in order -- you're in for a treat!), but Lev fans shouldn't miss it. Just be prepared for what a (relative) letdown the ending is, and let's hope that the next volume of Nick's adventures finally gives readers the resolution we crave!	2001-10-15

However, I found the unabridged audio version at the library, and figured it might make a good background accompaniment to housework and exercise.<br />Well, I was right about the implausible part -- we are expected to believe that wife Sylvie &amp; mistress Marla can change places, and not even Sylvie's KIDS would notice, to say nothing of her friend of 20+ years, her dad, etc. (Wisely, Goldsmith made Sylvie's mom be in on the plot. You can't fool a mom!) I found myself wishing that Goldsmith had made the switcheroo happen via supernatural means, a la FREAKY FRIDAY. I don't think I would have had to suspend my disbelief quite so much then!<br />Everyone in the book is dumb as a box of rocks (Marla is an airheaded, malaprop-spouting new ager who says things like &quot;How dare you insult my grandma&quot; when Sylvie corrects her grammar). I will admit, though, that the final scene, when all is finally revealed, made me chuckle. And the audiobook's narrator, Cristina McMurdo-Wallis, is a marvel. I'd gladly listen to her read just about anything -- even this silly piece of fluff.	2001-10-02

I've been following the Rei Shimura series since Book #1 (THE SALARYMAN'S WIFE), and while I've found all of the books to be enjoyable, Sujata Massey has really taken a great leap forward with her fifth mystery, THE BRIDE'S KIMONO. I couldn't put this book down -- I finished it in one marathon 6-hour session! <br />Unlike the other books in the series, THE BRIDE'S KIMONO takes place in the U.S., Washington, D.C. to be specific. But if you love these books for their take on Japanese culture, don't worry -- there's still plenty of that here. Rei is hired by a museum in D.C. to travel from her home in Japan to give a lecture on kimono. Part of the job entails actually bringing several priceless kimono with her from Japan to the U.S. In order to get a cheap ticket, Rei joins a package tour of young Japanese &quot;office ladies&quot; who are heading to the U.S. to shop.<br />When one of the valuable kimono disappears, along with one of the Japanese tourists, Rei suspects the two incidents are related. Things are further complicated when her old boyfriend, Hugh, turns up! There are SO many complications and twists and turns in this wonderfully complex novel. Massey is a master storyteller, and hopefully, this fabulous book will win her lots of new fans. It will certainly delight those who are already acquainted with Rei.	2001-09-13

Good news/bad news: You discover a fantastic new mystery series. Yay! Then you find out there are only two books in the series, and the author has no immediate plans to write more. Boo! If you haven't yet met Seattle translator Margit Andersson, you're in for a treat. &quot;Fate of Ravens&quot; and its predecessor, &quot;Runemaker,&quot; are delightful, suspenseful amateur sleuth tales, featuring, as a bonus, lots of insight into Scandinavian history and culture. What really made these books come alive for me were the characters. Margit and her friends are so well-rounded and real that I half-expect I'd run into them if I stopped by a certain Seattle coffee shop. I enjoyed Margit's cat, Gregor, too. Recommended to all amateur sleuth/cozy fans, but particularly those with an interest in Scandinavia! I'll be keeping my fingers crossed that Tiina will decide to put her translation work aside and bring Margit back some day...	2001-08-22

Not many books capture &quot;real life&quot; in all its messy, confused, complicated glory the way this one does.

Have you ever had the experience of reading a book and, despite the fact that you've never met the author, felt that it was written JUST FOR YOU? Well, that's what reading A YEAR IN VAN NUYS was like for me. Never mind that I've never set foot in Van Nuys; I could relate so much to Sandra, in her mid-30s, her youth passing her by, wondering, where's that novel I should have written -- heck, where's my Oscar? I can't remember the last time a book made me laugh so hard as I was nodding, &quot;Yes, that's so TRUE!&quot; Sandra is the funniest woman in America and you don't have to be a Southern Californian to love this book.

Not that I have a particular interest in falconry; it just made the book stand out from the other paperbacks on the rack. And indeed, Frank Pavlicek's hobby was a great component of the story, and I learned a lot. The main story - Frank stumbles upon a corpse, and it turns out his daughter knew the murdered young man - is nicely plotted and suspenseful. My only gripe is that I wish the writing had been a little snappier. Straka has a way to go until he reaches the level of a Pronzini or Grafton. But will I be keeping an eye out for future Pavlicek adventures? You bet.	2001-06-02

For many years, I lived less than a mile away from her home in Northern Baltimore, and occasionally I would drive past in hopes of catching a glimpse of her out in the yard. I never did. However, in her last book, &quot;A Patchwork Planet,&quot; she did provide one small window into her personal life: a dedication in memory of her late husband, who must have died while that book was being written.<br />With that piece of information in mind, it becomes apparent to the reader that &quot;Back When We Were Grownups&quot; is Tyler's first novel as a widow. The main character, Rebecca, is widowed; there are aching descriptions of what it's like to lose a loved one. If this is Tyler's most melancholy work, well, it's understandable, given the circumstances.<br />Somehow, she manages to make each new family of Baltimore eccentrics seem fresh; the dialogue rings true, and each character's traits are carefully observed (I particularly loved Rebecca's ex-boyfriend's obsession with his home-cooked chili). My only quarrel is that there are SO many characters that at times, I felt like drawing up a family tree just to keep track of all the in-laws and children and ex-husbands (not to mention the many repairmen constantly tending to Rebecca's crumbling old house). This is a bittersweet, beautifully written work.	2001-05-11

Can anything possibly live up to the hype? Well, after hearing for months about how fabulous A PLACE OF EXECUTION is, I finally read it, and I was totally blown away. Beautifully written, compelling, characters you'd swear were real -- this book has it all. I raced through this 400-page book in only 2 1/2 days; whenever I put it down, all I could do was think about how much I was looking forward to coming back to it!

So I couldn't wait to read this book. What a disappointment. Goldsmith is far better at capturing the lives of glittering, glamorous people than a group of fairly ordinary Seattle twentysomethings. The plot is predictable from beginning to end. And did Goldsmith even visit Seattle, or did she do her research long distance? At one point Jon goes to the Seattle airport because he thinks it would be a good place to pick up women. He zeroes in on a flight arriving from Tacoma. Uh, Olivia, the Seattle airport is practically IN Tacoma. That's why it's called SEATAC.<br />Arriving only 11 months after the 500-page YOUNG WIVES, BAD BOY is a bad book that I can only imagine Goldsmith simply rushed to finish. Next time, I hope she takes a little more time and produces a yummy novel that's worth waiting for.	2001-02-28

There are three plots. First and foremost, there's the storyline described by the title, where Joe, a part-time college professor who does a bit of stakeout work for a detective firm, searches for a missing call girl at the behest of his Portuguese cleaning woman. Then we meet Joe's officemate, a fellow part-time prof who's being sued for racial discrimination by a black student. Finally, there's Joe's live-in lover, who suddenly starts acting very, very strange indeed.<br />Yes, the latter two plots have nothing to do with the main one, but I enjoyed the fact that this is not a normal whodunit. For one thing, it's wildly funny -- I almost dropped the book at a couple of points, I was laughing so hard. And Joe is a pleasant fellow to spend some time with. The wrap-up to the title mystery is a bit convoluted, but on the whole, &quot;The Kidnapping of Rosie Dawn&quot; is a refreshing read.	2001-01-24

However, the dry voice is particularly suited to telling this grisly tale of a satanic cult murder in the heartland. There's no need to embellish a tale this vivid with rhetorical flourishes; as it is, &quot;Eleven Days&quot; gave me nightmares. What you see in your mind's eye is scarier than anything a writer's overly descriptive pen could produce.<br />I will admit that I saw the ending coming, and that I had a hard time telling all the cops apart. However, police procedural fans will LOVE this book, because it's pure procedure from the first page to the last. After you finish this gripping novel, you will truly have experienced what it is like to be a small-town policeman investigating a murder.	2000-12-14
US	49429258	R1YDMOE59CV6PF	0312865643	77731093	Authorized Personnel Only	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Procedural fans will enjoy this book	Barbara D'Amato's HELP ME PLEASE and KILLER.APP were two utterly un-put-downable suspense thrillers. AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY isn't nearly as exciting, but it's interesting as a &quot;week in the life of a cop.&quot; Suze Figueroa and her partner Bennis are two patrol officers who are given the chance to become acting detectives when many of Chicago's finest are struck down by food poisoning following a banquet. They are faced with solving the murder of several homeless people, despite the fact that the department doesn't want to grant them resources due to the low status of the victims. At the same time, a child molester has moved into the attic of the home Suze shares with her sister's family, and is waiting for the right moment to attack Suze's young niece. Will Suze discover the intruder before it's too late?<br />I missed the heart-pounding suspense of D'Amato's previous Chicago cop books, but I did enjoy AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY as a police procedural. The author has obviously done a tremendous amount of research and I learned a lot. As a longtime fan, I must say that any D'Amato is worth reading -- she's a solid, reliably good crime writer.	2000-11-29

Must be because Jacob's so delightful...a devoted father who's a little embarrassed by his financial success as a screenwriter of a schlocky but hugely profitable Hollywood movie. However, I do wish Jacob wouldn't be *quite* so pushy when he goes about his detective work. You'd think a man with two young sons would be a little more careful. If he weren't a fictional character, someone surely would have bumped him off a long time ago! Witten is a writer for &quot;Law and Order&quot; but don't look for the grittiness or realism of that show in his books. Still, if you enjoy humorous, well-plotted mysteries, give this series a try. Witten's books are among the few that always make me laugh out loud.	2000-11-20

Then I gradually began to realize how much I have in COMMON with Eliza. She is a born worrier and a late bloomer, a person who still hasn't found her true career path even at the age of 32. This is a funny, warmhearted look at the relationship between two sisters, both living the single life in New York City. Schmais wraps things up a little too neatly in the end, but I must admit that I really got swept up in the story. I'll definitely be on the look-out for Schmais' next book.	2000-11-13

I adored Caroline Preston's debut novel, &quot;Jackie By Josie,&quot; and while &quot;Lucy Crocker 2.0&quot; doesn't quite measure up to the standards set by that book, it's still a fun novel. The multiple points of view can be a little jarring, but there's a lot of humor and heart here. And the computer game/Internet part of the story is believable and accurate -- Ms. Preston obviously did her research. Fans of authors like Sara Lewis, Eleanor Lipman, Jane Green, and Christina Bartolomeo, this one's for you!	2000-11-06
US	49429258	R1LWG35RP2TI6B	0451409396	146839939	Savage Art	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Girard really knows how to build suspense	I will admit that this is NOT usually the kind of book I read; for one thing, it's a serial killer novel, and for another, it deals with the murder and mutilation of children. However, a friend gave me a copy and I plunged into this dark, dark tale. I think FBI profiler Casey is a wonderful character, and the book is so suspenseful that I could barely put it down until the chilling climax. But &quot;Savage Art&quot; is definitely not for the squeamish. It's pretty graphic and violent. Still, if you're a fan of Patricia Cornwell and Thomas Harris, I'd have to say it's a do-not-miss.	2000-11-01

I read a lot of mysteries, and every once in a while, one will &quot;break through the clutter&quot; and REALLY grip me. Both of Lisa Kleinholz's novels, &quot;Exiles on Main Street&quot; and now &quot;Dancing with Mr. D,&quot; have held my attention from the first page to the last. Not only is this a thrilling mystery, but the emotional core of the novel -- reporter/sleuth Zoe's relationship with her husband, a musician and former drug addict who isn't quite able to leave his troubled past behind -- brought a tear to my eye. Lisa Kleinholz deserves to be recognized as one of the most promising new mystery authors in the business.	2000-10-27

Joe is an actor who appears in commercials, which gives him plenty of free time to solve crimes. He's really more of a cactus man, but he enters the cutthroat (really!) world of orchids in order to find out who murdered a member of the local orchid society. It's not too difficult to guess whodunit, and the plot could be stronger, but this book is still a light and amusing read. I liked Joe's deadpan observations and wry sense of humor, and enjoyed learning about the differences between cactus and orchid lovers.	2000-10-04

Parker's Spenser novels, I started here. Now, I am definitely planning  to continue making my way through the series, but if it weren't for  Parker's sterling reputation, I don't know that I would have been inspired  to pick up Book 2 after reading &quot;The Godwulf Manuscript.&quot; For  anyone who's read a lot of private eye novels, this is a fairly standard  tale of a two-fisted gumshoe who's always drinking, fighting, irresistible  to women, etc. Plus it's set against an early '70s backdrop of student  rebellion which seems almost quaint now. Nevertheless, I like Spenser's  sassy first-person voice, and I've already started &quot;God Save the  Child.&quot; Onward and upward!	2000-09-17

When I started reading Bill Pronzini's Nameless Detective series earlier this year, 27 books seemed like an awful lot to plow through. When I  finally finished &quot;Crazybone,&quot; though, I wished there were 27  more! I feel like I know &quot;Nameless&quot; and Kerry better than some of  my own relatives! Happily, &quot;Crazybone&quot; is one of the best entries  in this series; I loved the subplot with Nameless' mother-in-law (author of  a private eye series starring tough-guy detective Samuel Leatherman) trying  to snoop into the suspicious death of one of her elderly neighbors. I  heartily recommend going back to &quot;The Snatch&quot; and reading all 27  Nameless books in order; what a wonderful thing Bill Pronzini has  accomplished by writing this series.	2000-09-02
US	49429258	RU87YUPBTFGRI	0385305052	623285232	Demons	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Another great book in this excellent series	Along with &quot;Shackles,&quot; I think this is a high point of the  Nameless Detective series. The PI agrees to take on the kind of job he  hates the most as a favor to a friend -- help a woman whose husband is  having an affair. The husband's paramour, Nedra, is a seductress with whom  he is completely obsessed. Eventually, Nedra goes missing -- and in her  absence, the cheating husband goes off the deep end. This is a totally  absorbing book, made even more so by the addition of personal problems in  the detective's life (his longtime love, Kerry, appears to be having an  affair of her own; his ex-partner, Eberhardt, continues giving Nameless the  cold shoulder). I'm so grateful to Pronzini for continuing this series and  really wish more people realized how great it is!	2000-08-14
US	49429258	R2WJH6DBWZSXYR	0671776126	362447474	Plain Truth	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Fascinating look at Amish life	I spend all day working at a computer, listening to the radio, watching  TV, driving my car, talking on the phone...all things forbidden to members  of the Old Order Amish sect. What would it be like to say goodbye to the  modern world and live the slower paced, religiously contemplative life of  an Amish woman? The promise of learning the answer to that question --  something that has intrigued me ever since a high school trip to Amish  country many years ago -- was what made me pick up &quot;Plain Truth,&quot;  and I was not disappointed. Jodi Picoult has done a brilliant job of  capturing the rhythms of Amish life. &quot;Plain Truth&quot; is a great  legal thriller, too. I can't remember the last time I got so caught up in a  book -- this would make a great read for a long plane trip! The only reason  I'm docking it a star is because I found the main character a bit too one  dimensional (the cutthroat, childless career woman who deep in her heart  desperately wants to have a baby), and I guessed the &quot;surprise  ending&quot; about halfway through. Still, I highly recommend &quot;Plain  Truth&quot; and plan to read more by Jodi Picoult!	2000-08-08
US	49429258	ROYEQM88NXC66	0440205239	431667439	Shackles	Books	5	3	3	N	N	The best in a fabulous series	I have been reading all of the Nameless Detective series in order, and  this is definitely the high point so far. In fact,  I would rank it in the  top 10 crime novels of all time. That's how good it is -- a true tour de  force of suspense by a master author. Nameless is abducted by an unknown  assailant who takes him to a remote mountain cabin in the middle of winter.  Nameless is shackled and left to die. I don't think I'm spoiling anything  when I say that he does not perish (after all, there are at least 10 more  books in the series), but how he gets out and what happens when he does are  utterly fascinating. Most of the book takes place in Nameless' head -- his  thoughts while imprisoned. We learn so much about his character and past. I  can't recommend this book highly enough, though this is really a series  that needs to be read in order (don't forget his short story collection,  CASE FILE). It'll take you a while to make it up to SHACKLES, but it's  worth the trip!	2000-08-08

Readers like me, who have been following this series for years, will definitely  appreciate &quot;He Shall Thunder,&quot; because it ties  up a lot of loose  ends and solves some mysteries that have been puzzling Amelia fans for  years. (The only thing I could have done without in this book was the way  the characters were constantly donning disguises, to the point where it got  a bit ridiculous.) If you haven't yet met the Emerson family, I suggest  going back to the beginning of the series. Peters does give a nice summary  of the story so far at the start of the book, but if you really want to  understand the characters and their motivations, go back and read the  earlier books before tackling this one -- you'll be in for a treat!	2000-07-24

It's got a  fairly high body count, but it also has a great deal of humor. It's rare that books make me laugh out loud, but this one did! Nameless' partner, Eberhardt, is  dating a Macy's saleswoman named Wanda whose biggest, er, asset is her  enormous chest. Wanda and Nameless' girlfriend, Kerry, clash in a memorable  scene set in a dreadful Italian restaurant.<br />Pronzini gives us not one but  two locked room murders, a genre this mystery virtuoso has explored before.  Nameless' habit of stumbling across freshly dead bodies strains credulity a  bit, but if you can suspend your disbelief, sit back and enjoy another fine  adventure.	2000-07-24

I stayed up 'til 2 AM reading &quot;Listen to the  Silence.&quot; Not only is it a splendid mystery, but it's so beautifully  written -- Muller describes the landscapes of Montana, Idaho and Northern  California so well that I truly felt I'd visited those places! McCone fans  won't be disappointed, although the book does end with a cliffhanger that  will make us VERY impatient for the next installment...	2000-07-12

The Nameless Detective has lost his license and his lady; his friend on the police force, Eberhardt, has been dumped -- his wife left him for another man. How could things get worse? Well, a gunman attacks them and  they both get shot. Eb lands in a coma, Nameless takes a bullet in his left  arm. As his friend lies unconscious in the hospital, Nameless investigates  the crime, which leads him to the narrow alleyways of San Francisco's  Chinatown. Lots of great local color in this one; Nameless fans won't be  disappointed.	2000-06-29

The San Francisco's PI's deductive  abilities are so incredible that I admit it strained my credulity a bit.  However, it's an interesting idea (usually, when a PI is faced with  unrelated cases, they turn out to be linked in some way -- not so here,  thank goodness) so give Pronzini credit for trying something different. The  hardships faced by Nameless in this book (the loss of his professional  license, trouble with his girlfriend Kerry) made me eager to proceed to  Book 9 to see if there are better days ahead for our hero.	2000-06-28

It takes place at a pulp convention -- as Nameless fans know, the PI is an avid collector of old pulp detective  magazines. When a man is murdered in the convention hotel, in a locked  room, naturally, Nameless is called upon to solve the crime. Then a second  locked room murder takes place! The solution isn't 100% satisfying, but I  still enjoyed this loving look at the pulp fiction era, as well as  Nameless' tender affair with the daughter of two prominent genre writers.	2000-06-27

Pronzini breathes new life into that scenario with &quot;Labyrinth.&quot; Nameless has no idea who the  dead girl is -- how did she get his card? This book has tons of action and  excitement; thank goodness it's short enough to devour in one or two  sittings. Fans of the PI genre have got to check out Nameless. The books  are best read in order, so it's a major shame that they're out of print --  but they are certainly worth tracking down.	2000-06-26

Unfortunately, &quot;The Trophy Wife&quot; has NONE of the humor and humanity of Goldsmith's work. This  book is a dud -- I'm not surprised the author is using a pseudonym. The  only reason I finished it was because of the promised explosive  &quot;surprise ending,&quot; but even that was a letdown (I figured it out  partway through the book). I love a yummy, trashy summer read, but this  book was just a mishmash of unlikable characters and implausible plotting.  I must also note that I have never read a book with so many typos; if I'd  actually purchased this book instead of borrowing it from the library, I  think I would've demanded a refund!	2000-06-26

Roger Ebert is one of the best reviewers around, and I must admit that I'd rather read a savage review than a glowing one any day. This book contains  some of the most hilarious writing on film I've ever had the pleasure of  encountering -- check out his reviews of &quot;Little Indian, Big  City&quot; or &quot;Jack Frost.&quot; There are also reviews of films he  was truly revolted by, such as &quot;Caligula&quot; and &quot;I Spit On  Your Grave.&quot; Sure, much of it is available on the Sun Times' web site,  but I still find a lot of enjoyment in thumbing through a real book.  Besides, this is the sort of volume you'll want to leave on your coffee  table for all of your friends to enjoy!	2000-06-13

So far, they've all been terrific, but I must admit that I had to force myself to finish this one. Is it because we  actually learn the Nameless Detective's name!  Is it that the final plot  twist is foreshadowed to the point where a six-year-old could guess what  was coming? The story is told in alternating points of view by Pronzini's  PI and Wilcox's police detective; that technique worked far better in  Pronzini's &quot;Double&quot; (which he wrote with his wife, Marcia  Muller). &quot;Twospot&quot; was a disappointment, but I look forward to  reading the rest of the series.	2000-06-13
