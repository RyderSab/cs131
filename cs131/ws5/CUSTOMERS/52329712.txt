The three sisters are weak willed, spoiled and completely selfish.  The authority figures are stereotypical.  The hero and his dog were the only two characters worth any mention, but when the hero settled for one of the two timing sisters, the author left me only the dog to cheer for.	2005-09-21

By the time I finished the first book, I felt so relieved that I haven't been able to bring myself to pick up Morgan's story yet.)<br />OK, I really enjoyed Lori Foster's Winston brothers' series.  So I automatically grabbed this book anxious to learn about a new \\"Foster Family\\".  Sure the brothers are smart, sexy, and sensitive and seem fun to be around, but the female in this book made me ill.  Honey shows up out of the blue, and 2 days after waking up from a concussion & bronchitis she is telling the teenager to put on sunscreen AND automatically assumes control of the kitchen.  If I had found myself in a strangers' home, ill and supposedly frightened for my life, the LAST thing that I would be doing is cooking meals and lecturing the people who have been nice enough to take me into their home.  This is a woman who has been dominated by both her father and her ex-boyfriend and so it is not as if assertiveness with men has been in her nature.  Sure if some sexy doctor plucked me from certain death, takes me into his fantastic home and wants to make passionate love to me, I am there; but not with his curious teenager and 3 other brothers watching every move.<br />This one was a HUGE disappointment to me.	2002-07-30

To say that I enjoyed this book would be a VAST understatement.  The wit and writing style are fantastic.  Shannon's self-depreciating sense of humor is hilarious.  I laughed and sighed and genuinely hated to see the last page.  Shannon reminded me of a cross between Anita Blake (in the very beginning of the series) and Stephanie Plum - funny and willing to get the job done.  <br />Shannon Parker is a 35-year-old high school English teacher.  She is smart and sassy and fun to read about.  She winds up in a twisted dimension and finds herself in the middle of a battle of good and evil with some very familiar characters from her \\"past\\" life.  In this new life, she finds love, friendship and plenty of adventure.  <br />I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book.	2002-05-13

I freely admit this is my own fault, my expectations were way off.  I read all of the reviews, and was expecting a romance novel.  <br />When I read romance, I look for a fantasy.  I want dialog between the hero &amp; heroine that is inspiring and makes me want to fall in love too.  I want to know about the 2 main character's past and what draws them together and more than anything else; I want a reason to BELIEVE that these 2 people will have a happily ever-after ending.  What I got was a mystery novel.  Granted this mystery has some hot sex and interesting characters, with funny dialogue, but it is still a mystery.  <br />Janie has a group of friends who while enjoying drinks with the girls, stir the interest of a killer.  When things start to get dangerous, Jannie seeks the help of her next door neighbor, Sam the cop.   <br />The story is captivating and held my interest.  Overall the book is a very good read; it just was not the romantic novel that I was expecting.	2002-01-04

Cornelia has been sent away to college and while in school, she has been sheltered from the illness and poverty that have plagued the rest of her family.  When circumstances require her to return to her home, she is shocked by the reality facing her.  Her mother is in the hospital, her father has been reduced to take a menial low paying job and her elder brother is drinking and smoking cigarettes!  Overwhelmed by the daunting tasks ahead, Cornelia initially reacts with selfish disdain, but in true GLH fashion, she rises to the occasion.  She takes a firm hand in bringing beauty back into the lives of those who mean the most to her.  She does this by cleaning the house from top to bottom, restoring the pantry and setting elegant tables for dinner.  A quiet unassuming heroine, Cornelia breathes new life into her family and as she does; she of course draws the attention of a wealthy young suitor.  <br />I read these stories and I can almost see all of those old black and white photos of my grandparents spring to life. I feel more connected to my older relatives.  I can see why homemaking was and continues to be so important.   As I read GLH I sometimes feel feminist angst at the thought of some male protector sheltering the dear sweet little woman, but here as in so many of her books, Ms. Hill displays the subtle power that the woman used to impact her environment.	2001-08-17

I read an excerpt, and then I could not rest until I had the book in my hand and finish Kate & Jed&#8217;s story.  <br />Kate is a producer/writer who has had a hard time with her body that had matured faster than that of her friends.  She was humiliated and suffered abuse from the other kids in school.  She has made a tenuous peace with her past and with her ex-husband and as a result, is now working on a wonderful project.  She is producing a movie that she wrote, and come hell, high water or Jericho Beaumont this movie is going to be perfect.  <br />Jed is a man running from his emotions.  His acting career has dried up and Kate&#8217;s movie is his one last chance to be considered a serious actor.  He comes from an abusive past and has struggled to put the memories of shame and abuse behind him.  He has overcome alcohol & drug addictions, and now 5 yrs later is prepared to humble himself and take on the greatest role of his career.  <br />This is an interesting story.  I enjoyed the interactions between the characters.  I did find the constant 24/7 references a bit tedious.  There were some other things that got in the way of making this a 5 star read, but over all I enjoyed reading this story and look forward with great anticipation to reading the &#8220;Bodyguard&#8221;.	2001-07-19

So many reviewers have done such a great job in their descriptions that I don't want to rehash the story again.  Big whale, little ship, cannibalization, fascinating characters - all great elements to create a compelling story.  <br />This is not the typical genre that I gravitate toward, but I found myself unable to put this book down.  The descriptions of the whaling society in Nantucket hooked me from page one - and the story just would not let go.  I really don't care for gross out books, and to be honest if I had realized how much of that was in this novel, I would have passed it over.  That would have been a mistake.	2001-07-19

When she describes Marlene's (the dog) wardrobe and attitudes, I just have to laugh.  <br />I also like the fact that the main characters are not 18.  Ms Cruise writes about mature women with serious problems (somewhat exaggerated). <br />The mystery was a little shallow. The hero did not sweep me off of my feet, but the rest of the group makes up for him.  <br />I found this story very entertaining.  I became attached to most of the characters presented here.

I like GLH because I enjoy the pictures of the early century life as described by this novelist.  Her stories are simplistic and seldom have a great deal of depth, but they are usually entertaining and lighthearted.  This is not one of her better efforts.  <br />Ruth MacDoanld is the heroine of the tale.  She is a wealthy privileged young woman who has blithely lived her life with little or no thought to others.  One day she catches a glimpse of a former childhood friend going off to war and her eyes begin to open to the needs of others.   John Cameron is the young hero off to fight in WWI.   John goes off to war and begins a correspondence with Ruth, but the letters were too few and stopped before any real insight or depth of feeling between the couple could be established.  Then on the basis of these letters and some actions that John performed when they were both children, the two begin to form an attachment that I could never believe.  <br />The characters were detached and hard to really care about.  The actions taken by all of them were strange and difficult to follow.  The action is slow and spaced out.  GLH uses several of her usual plot devices: separation of the H&amp;H, devotion to the sweet little mother character and villains, but none of them could save this novel.	2001-05-02

Gaelen Foley can write on heck of a romantic novel.  Her love scenes are hot and steamy.  Her heroines are strong and romantic, and the MEN.  These men are just one of the reasons that I read romance novels.  Powerful &amp; protective, they totally mesmerize the reader. \\"The Princess\\" is no different.   Darius Santiago made his first appearance in \\"The Pirate Prince\\".  He was rescued, and brought to live with the royal family.  He has always done his duty to this family and become their most valued protector.  Naturally, he developed a relationship with the members of this family but most especially with Princess Serafina.  He has fallen in love with her over the years, but feels unworthy.  He must protect Serafina at all costs, especially from himself.  <br />Serafina of course does not want his protection in this area.  She has been in love with Darius all of her life, and would like nothing better than to settle down and live happily-ever-after with him.  Serafina is engaged to a disreputable prince.  This arrangement has been made to insure the safety of her country in the event of war.  Darius knows that this man has been chosen for Serafina, but how can he ever let her go?  <br />This is a terrific story of two people who have been in love forever, but have just a FEW things to straighten out before they can be together.     <br />The thing that I did not get, was how disconnected the royal family seemed to be. \\"The Pirate Prince\\" described a family that was attached and supportive.  In this book, Lazar and Allegra seem to be self-absorbed and to have completely isolated their children.  How else could they leave their daughter to sacrifice herself in a loveless marriage (especially after Lazar escaped from one in the previous book) or to let her waste away when she believes Darius has died.  This disconnection is felt in \\"Prince Charming\\" as well.   But, since this is Darius and Serafina's story, that can be overlooked.	2001-02-15

I have read everything the woman has ever written, and will continue to do so.  She has a formula that works for me.  The thing about Nora is, when you have read about 15 or so of her books, it is very easy to pick out characters/stories that have similarities.  <br />\\"Considering Kate\\" is no exception.  As I was reading this I was reminded of  \\"The McGregor Brides\\".  I think it was Julia's story where she is working as a real estate agent and has to gut her house and then falls in love with the contractor.  This story has several of the same situations even down to the kitchen remodeling ideas.  <br />Kate is a direct woman who knows what she wants.  She is the one of those Stanislaski's that we are all so fond of, and we get to check in on most of the clan.  She has decided that it is time to retire from her career as a professional ballerina and start her own studio.  Kate has purchased an old building in her parent's hometown, and the renovations begin.   <br />Brody...what can I say except this man I want to meet!  He is beautiful, sensitive, and in love with his son.  He is a widower and has the sole responsibility of raising his little boy, Jack.  Brody is the contractor hired to renovate Kate's dance studio.  He is resistant to Kate's overtures at first, but of course he comes around.  <br />If you like Nora's stuff you won't be disappointed.	2001-02-13

This is a hard book for me to review, because I don't have strong feelings about it one way or the other.  I love fairy tales, especially romantic ones, but I am not that excited about this one.  It is a combination of Cinderella and The Little Mermaid, and while those are two of the best, they don't carry over here very well.  This is a very sweet and simple story.  <br />Maggie lives with Nicholas as his house cat.  She has fallen in love with him and because she is a different sort of cat, she is granted her wish of becoming a human to entice Nicholas to fall in love with her. <br />Nicholas is an attorney who is engaged to a woman that no one likes.  He has spent his life making sacrifices for the benefit of his sister.  What I did not get was: If Nicholas is such an intelligent man (graduate of Harvard) how does he think that his family is going to get along after the marriage, when his sister and his fiancee hate each other's guts?  <br />The story held my attention, but it was almost as if the author was trying too hard.  There were romantic moments; dancing in the rain, walking on the beach, but they were all so contrived that it was really hard to get into.  If you like the cat concept, but would like a little more depth, I recommend \\"Raja\\" by Dara Joy.	2001-02-12

All of them are wonderful works of fantasy, but my favorite of the group would have to be \\"Dark Desire\\".  I was swept away by the power of the Carpathian male.  I felt for all of these men who longed for their other half.  They were so strong but so vulnerable UNTIL they found their partner.  When they found their life-mate, they became just a tad overbearing.  Don't get me wrong, the protection and authority that these heroes bring to the novel is really the most compelling part of the books, but Jacques's story was different. <br /> Jacques is the younger brother of Mikhail from the \\"Dark Prince\\".  He had been tortured and left for dead for 7 years.  He has been completely isolated with the exception of the brief times that he was able to connect mentally with a young doctor thousands of miles away.  Jacques's separation and constant pain have combined to create a mental state that is fragmented at best.  His connection to Shea is his tenuous link to sanity.   He has forgotten most of his past and must rely on Shea to protect and provide for him until he has recovered.    Shea is the first of her kind.  Her father was Carpathian and her mother human.  She has spent her career focused on finding a cure for the rare blood disorder that she has been suffering from.  Shea has been experiencing unexplained bouts of pain and can not explain the link that she has with Jacques.  She is compelled to rescue him despite the danger to herself.  This is a strong goal-oriented woman who has what it takes to get things done.  <br />The relationship between Jacques and Shea truly demonstrates for me the \\"life-mate\\" concept.  He brings power and justice to the relationship and Shea provides the knowledge and healing.  This is one of the few books in the series so far, where both partners are equally strong and both must respect the other's gifts and limitations.   These books are somewhat graphic, and the blood exchanges are not for everyone.  I loved this series.  I feel connected to ALL of the characters in these books and I am anxiously waiting for their stories.	2001-02-08

Before everyone can walk happily into the sunset, Sebastian is hung on the gallows.  He gallantly swears to come back to Lilith. She searches for the secret to immortality so that she will be ready when he comes for her.  600 years later, she is still waiting.  Just when Lilith is ready to take matters into her own hands, her dream lover moves in next door.  Mitch (who has no recollection of his past life as Sebastian) is an investigative reporter with 2 kids.  He does not believe in fortune-telling, magic or in Lilith. <br />I liked the 2 main characters here very much.  Mitch was a strong man who loves and protects his children.   You have to admire that in a man.  Lilith is lonely (who wouldn't be after 600 years) and longs for a family.  She creates potions to music and gets herself into some interesting situations.   The romance between these two is sweet and develops from page 1.   There were several gaps in the story, and some elements that should have been further developed, but I will definitely read Claire Cross again.	2001-02-06

I listened to an unabridged version of this book.  Unlike the majority of reviews, I really enjoyed it.  This novel was focused less on relationship issues, and put emphasis on the unfolding of the mystery.  I found myself becoming more and more involved as the story progressed.   In the final chapters of the book, my heart was pounding, my hands were clenching the steering wheel and I couldn't get out of the car until it was all over.   Milo has drawn another impossible case, and Alex is called upon for advice.  The only lead they can come up with, is a connection with a murderer from the past - Ardis Peak.  Peak was convicted of a hideous crime and is presently serving his sentence in a high security psychiatric hospital.  He has inside information on the current investigation, and no one can figure out why.  There are suspects and victims everywhere.  The story was well developed and highly entertaining.	2001-01-31

I actually woke up 3 hours early so that I could finish  \\"The Duke and I\\" before work this morning.  It all begins with the birth of Simon, who turns out to be \\"defective\\" according to his father.  Simon then has to overcome his stuttering in seclusion and shame.  He develops into a charismatic hero that the reader can root for from the very beginning of the book.   Simon meets Daphne and is immediately intrigued.  They form a partnership and agree to pretend an attachment, so that neither will be plagued by the constant pressure of marriage.  The connection between these two is instant and very interesting to observe.  Daphne is a sheltered young lady, with courage and determination.  Simon has to wrestle demons from his past and fortunately Daphne is the one to help him succeed.  I enjoyed the romance between these two characters immensely.   The one dark spot in this book for me, was the situation that Daphne created when she had no respect for her husband's wishes and decided to blatantly do what she wanted.  I do not think that such an action is easily forgiven, but it did succeed to move the plot to its appropriate ending.   All in all, this is a very enjoyable book.	2001-01-30

The love scenes were hot and the romance was sweet.    Not only were the H/H fun to watch, but the secondary characters were great too.

This book is a rule breaker for me because - #1) I don't usually like time travel novels and #2) I HATE stories that are sad &amp; weepy.  \\"Remembrance\\" is both.  But, I have to say that I love this book.  <br />Hayden is a romance writer who wonders if she will ever find true love.  She then goes on a quest to discover exactly what has happened in her past lives to prevent her from finding love in this one.   The part of this book that really got my attention and my emotions involved; was the story of Talis and Callesandra.  Their tragic story is the primary focus of this book, and I have to say that I HATED the end of their story.  I know that their love story continues on through the other characters in the book, but I wanted THEM (I am whining here) to be together!   I read romance novels to sigh, smile, and to step out of reality for just a few minutes to experience romantic relationships without all sweat and effort.  I do not want to weep and mourn in my escape reading, however, as I said, this novel was the exception to the rule.	2001-01-22

I began this book with very low expectations.  I read the reviews and thought that I would give this one a try.  I am glad that I did.  I will read Nicole Jordan again; I just don't consider her a favorite author. The story begins with a rake and an almost innocent.  Damien (the rake) must go home and help his sister deal with the repercussions of a horrible accident.  In doing so, he \\"engages\\" the help of Vanessa (the almost innocent). I found it hard to like Damien to begin with.  He was shallow, and self absorbed, but it was a nice change to watch the hero develop an awareness of his own actions and how they affect others.    Vanessa is down on her luck due to the careless actions of her late husband and older brother.  She must become a companion by day and a mistress by night.   The love scenes are wonderfully explicit and make up for what I consider the lack of development in the characters.  I enjoyed reading the story, I was interested and entertained, but at the same time, when I finished the book, I was finished.  I don't have any attachment to the people in this story.	2001-01-18

What I learned, was more about my own life. Anyone who has listened to Rich Mullins music knows that he had a heart for the God that he so often wrote of.  His music has always struck a chord within me. This book provides glimpses into the life of a very remarkable sensitive man.    Many people seemed disappointed about not getting more biographical information from this book, but after reading some of Rich's journal entries &amp; quotations I agree with the author; that Rich would not have appreciated a book written about the facts of his life.  Rich did not want people to look to him, or to his music for spiritual inspiration, but rather to his God.  I found myself pausing over and over again throughout the book, to simply absorb the truths that Rich revealed in his observations about life. This is powerful reading that will I will continue to study for some time.	2001-01-18

The instructions here are clear and very easy to follow.  In less than 5 minutes, I was mediating (With RESULTS!).  I don't know about visualizing what you want (money, love, jobs) and then getting it, but I have received what I wanted, which was a time to slow down, re-energize and focus on the simple rhythms of my body.

And the story of Joanna and Gabriel would have to be one of my favorites of hers.  This is not easy to say, because all of her books are really wonderful.  I like Joanna and Gabriel best because I like the way they seem to fit.  Joanna has been abused and is going to do everything in her power to see that it never happens to her again.  She is a woman who gets things done.  She is optimistic and has an open heart.  Both characteristics are very important when she finds herself dragged to the highlands (by a loving brother) to marry a Scottish Laird.  Gabriel is doing what he can to protect his people, even if it means marrying some English woman.  He is strong and of course protective of what belongs to him.     I get bored in romance novels where the main characters fight up to the last chapters of the book.  These 2 are united in the early part of the novel, and I like to watch their relationship grow and develop as they begin to understand what it means to be married and to trust one another. I first read this novel several years ago, and I pull it out to reread at least once every six months.  It never fails to bring a sigh &amp; smile.	2001-01-11

The readers contribute so much emotion to their reading.  The listener can hear the music of Ireland in each voice.  Every time I listen to this, I hear something new.  Some of the poems included are: Stolen Child; The Indian to his Love; The Cloak, the Boat and the Shoes and The Sad Shepherd.  This has brought many hours of relaxation and beauty to my evenings.  I highly recommend this tape.	2001-01-11

Nora, comes back to live her 9th life and meets up with her soul mate again.  This would be great if said soul mate has not been responsible for killing Nora in all of her other lives.  This was a lively and entertaining story.  I do feel as if the story could have been a bit more romantic.  It seemed as if the H/H just fell in love in the dream segments instead of the time that they were presently experiencing.  The originality of the story, and Nora's high spirited personality made up for that slight oversight.	2001-01-10

I just finished this book and I am so sad that the story is over.  Anthony and Kate have become very real.   Anthony has decided that it is time that he was married.  His chosen bride is to be the shining star of the season Edwina.  Kate (Edwina's sister) is very protective and has to be sure that the man who marries her sister is worthy of the honor. Anthony &amp; Kate spend so much time together trying to work out the situation, that they forget that Edwina is even in the picture.  The best part about this book is that all of the characters in it are so refreshing.  I wanted to know more about each one of them.  My favorite scene is the family game of Pall Mall.  I laughed out loud.  The facial expressions, the conversations, I actually felt like I was there watching the game.  What a fun book to read.  Highly recommended!	2001-01-09

Spending his time in frivolous pursuits.  All that is changed when his father needs to take a vacation from the throne, and it is up to Rafe to prove that he has what it takes to be king.  Then Rafe meets Daniela and his boredom seems to disappear.  Daniela is a hero to the people of her country (the Robin Hood thing).  She is brave and loyal, but not too perfect.  I liked the characters in this book, but at times I found myself shaking my head over some of the ridiculous things that they wound up doing.  Rafe behaved like a jerk (holding/fondling his girlfriend in his lap in front of the council of advisors).  No wonder people wouldn't take his authority seriously.  And really, what was up with the Daniela instantly becoming bonded to Queen Mother five minutes after she wakes from a coma?  I understand what the author was going for, but that was too much.  Having said all that, I did enjoy this book.  I liked the fact that Rafe &amp; Daniela were a united front.  They were in love and they fought almost all of the obstacles together.  I will definitely read more of Gaelen Foley's books.	2001-01-03

I have read all of the books so far (Faith of the Fallen) and this is a wonderful start to a good series.  The Wizard's First Rule is by far one of the best books in this group.  The other great one, would be The Stone of Tears.  In his first book, Goodkind introduces Richard, a simple woods-guide who's  life is irrevocably changed when he meets a young woman in trouble.  There is danger, magic, romance, monsters, dragons, war and just about anything else that the reader could ask for. The characters are flawed (at least in the beginning) and as a result, interesting.  This book is definitely worth the investment of time it will take to read it.  This is one of my all time favorite books.	2001-01-02

It is written in a style similar to Dr. Suess with beautiful illustrations and a funny story.  The kids that I read this with especially like the \\"hidden snowman\\" on every page. This is a great addition to your Christmas collection.	2000-12-13

Whitney was a misunderstood, awkward tomboy who blooms into a stunning, intelligent &amp; talented heroine.  Clayton is a handsome, rich Duke who is fascinated by Whitney.  He will let nothing stop him from his goal of securing Whitney as his Duchess.  The misunderstandings and adventures that ensue are entertaining and emotional as Whitney &amp; Clayton learn about themselves and each other.   The conversations that the characters engage in are interesting and clever.  I did not want to miss a single word in this book.	2000-12-13

No one who read SOL and understood the characters could believe that they are the same people in this book.  I enjoy being scared by Thomas Harris; This  book was not frightening just gross.  If you loved SOL &amp; TRD do not  waste your time with this book.  This book was not frightening just gross.	2000-07-14

This is by far one of the best performed books that I have ever listened to.  Mr. Jim Dale is wonderful!  I smiled, laughed and actually cheered my way  through several traffic jams, thanks to Harry Potter and his friends.  Please publish the remaining stories in unabridged audio, and don't let  anyone read them but Mr. Dale!	1999-10-22

If you want to read a Jude Deveraux novel try &quot;Knight in Shining Armor&quot;, &quot;Wishes&quot;, or &quot;Remembrance&quot;, or any of her other books.  DO NOT READ THIS ONE.  I love escape literature, but the  dialog and the actions of the two main characters are so unbeliveable that  I just wanted the book to end as soon as possible.  The characters are  annoying and I could not find anyone to cheer for.	1999-03-30
