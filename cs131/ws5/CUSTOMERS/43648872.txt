I love baking cakes &amp; making sweets. But being a mother of two little ones I don't have enough time (or energy) to make cakes from scratch. This book is a treat for me, because I don't need a lot of planning ahead nor to spend too much time in the kitchen!!<br />A few days ago I made the Peanut Butter Cake &amp; it looked impressive and was delicious!! I felt like a million dollars presenting it.<br />The book is full of appetizing pictures for nearly all the recipes, easy to use &amp; follow directions, and has lots of tips &amp; ideas. It also tells you how many calories are in a slice (for all you gals who want to know, although my advise is to skip that particular line).<br />In the book you will find all kinds of recipes for cakes, trifles, cupcakes, cookies &amp; more.<BR>Indulge yourself &amp; your family.	2003-11-13

It started out great, but I couldn't feel much for the characters, & I didn't like Grace much (the heroin) at the beginning, not someone strong enough for the hero. Also I couldn't connect with Julian (the hero). <BR>What I couldn't figure out is that if he couldn't be with her -physically- till the end of the month then why the hell was he jumping in the shower with her at every opportunity???? He must have titanium self-control! Also, for someone who was trapped for god knows how long in darkness, I expected him to feel more interested in seeing the world around him when given the chance. Why not spend the time doing something together that helps them learn more about each other, WITHOUT the temptations of getting naked...

What a wonderful story.<br />What hooked me was the dramatic & mysterious prologue, then I kept reading till the wee hours of the morning just to know what'll happen to Rhapsody! The more I read the more I loved the characters.<br />Rhapsody is a beautiful strong woman, a Namer which means she can change things or people if she knew their REAL name.<br />The Brother is a deadly assasin who can pinpoint the heartbeat of anyone who was born in the doomed island of Seren.<br />Grunthor, a giant sergent major who is funny & strong.<br />Rhapsody mistakingly frees The Brother & gets thrown in with both men into a journey through the earth core, where they end up miles & centuries away from their homeplace.<br />You get caught up in building their new life & dicovering Rhapsody's old past. A very interesting & engaging story.<br />Read it!!<br />I recommend it to fantacy/Sci-fiction fans who enjoy Terry Goodkind, Robert Jordan & Anne Bishop.<br />Good reading.. & thank you Ms. Haydon for this very enjoyable read.	2001-09-01

I'm used to the Sci-fiction 5-7 book 700 page series & wanted a light romantic book to read for a change. This was just so. The story..... well.. there wasn't a story really!! A little romance, a background story about the french revolution & the \\"Black Rose\\" -a mysterious hero who saved the french aristocrts from the revolutionaries- there were LOTS of steamy sex scenes & some funny scenes as well.. I liked the twist at the end ...... But that's all! Then again I got what I was looking for ;-)<br />I recomend it if you want to read a light book to fuel your imagination & put you in a good mood. I will be re-reading some of the chapters & I'll certainly be looking for Dara Joy's other books!	2001-08-17

This is a great book to read if you are interested in a good fantasy book. It's an original world with many dimentions, well developed plot with unexpected twists. The charecters are deep & mysterious. I admire the way Ms. Bishop writes, she grips the attention of the reader & gives information little by little when you least expect. There isn't a lot of meaningless descriptions of places, buildings, frills etc... (The boring stuff). My only warning is that this book is not for young readers, becuase of the sexual component that made me blush(...)	2001-06-08
