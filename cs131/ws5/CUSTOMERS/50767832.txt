THIS ONE IS A HOME RUN!	Goff's book is both a sports and management book. It is filled with examples drawn from sporting events and related episodes. Sport fans interested in the behind-the-scenes decision making and leadership issues should thoroughly enjoy this volume. But those seeking new insights into management will find the book a refreshing approach that centers around issues faced by managers regardless of setting. Those interested in both management and sports should love this book.  <br /> <br />The backbone of the book are principles of management developed over the last few decades. The author does not try to develop a template for management based on case studies, although they are used to highlight key facts about management and stimulate discussion.  <br /> <br />After presenting key building block ideas (such as recognition of hidden costs and trade-offs, coordinating decisions, learning and adapting), the chapters of the book go on to explore such topics as: key matters about markets and management; people management; the effective use of information; tools for strategic and tactical decision making; and the role of innovation and adaptation. The last two chapters consider how managers add value to an organization, draws a distinction between effective management and over-managing (managing vs. meddling), and managing and leading.  <br /> <br />This is a marvelous book that casts a bright light on many complex and subtle management issues. With this book, Goff has hit a home run!	2005-07-26

Based on extensive research, and a very in-depth study of two cases, the author puts forth two key arguments regarding how leaders can enhance the quality of their decision-making processes: (1) leaders must cultivate constructive conflict so as to enhance the level of critical and divergent thinking, while simultaneously building consensus to facilitate the efficient and timely implementation of choices they make; (2) effective leaders must spend time deciding how to decide. A recurring theme is that leaders must strive for a delicate balance of assertiveness and restraint; the critical question is not whether, but how they ought to exert their influence and control over the decision-making process.The book offers practical guidance for leaders to improve the way they make complex, high-stakes choices. The work is rich with content and insights. Highly recommended.	2005-07-11

Business is conducted across all types of boundaries through collaborative strategies and arrangements. These collaborative enterprises can be extremely complex. This book explores what these collaborations look like, the challenges they face, and how to make them work. Based on analysis of three case studies, the authors present an action framework to guide executives in building such collaborations. The challenge is to manage complexity so that it enhances and energizes the collaboration instead of destroying it. Success hinges upon the people and the nature and quality of their interrelationships and interactions, the key to which is structure: well-defined roles, expectations, responsibilities, decision-making processes, and the like. Structure offers a zone of stability within which complex collaborations can develop and successfully function. Three-quarters of the book presents and analyzes the cases, offing many insights. The action framework is formally presented in the last two chapters.	2005-07-04

If you're looking for some real nuggets or depth of thought, this book does not deliver! Its theme is simple: what it takes to win in today's business. Topics covered include:   - the importance of mission and values;   - how candor leads to winning;   - eight rules of leadership;   - guidelines for effective hiring;   - eight practices for managing people;   - parting ways;   - change; and   - crisis management.     A section is devoted to basic topics of business management:   - strategy;   - budgeting;   - organic growth;   - mergers and acquisitions;   - six sigma.   The Welches devote a section to career:  - the right job,  - getting promoted,   - what to do when you encounter a bad boss,   - work-life balance.   It wraps up with a chapter on a hodge-podge of topics that didn't fit any place else.    The authors glibly glide over a wide range of subjects. The topics sound good but there's little meat on these bones.  It is a  very fast fly-over, with no special insights-just a breezy overview about things (largely basics) you should know-and probably do.     Of course the book is sprinkled with some of Jack Welch's old favorites, such as his \\"candid, clear-cut performance system\\" of 20/70/10. At best, and being a bit kind (which Jack would never do), the book barely makes the middle 70%.	2005-06-06

The author, an organizational psychologist, consultant, and professor, states that the challenge in this book is to explore a concept of congruence relating to effective organizational and managerial performance.  <br /> <br />This is a book about organization, business options and strategies, and innovation, but the overarching theme is congruence. Williams points out that people spend 78% of their lives within organizations and this reality makes clear the need for a sound conceptual base for the integration of people and systems.  <br /> <br />This book focuses on a body of knowledge that balances and requires the bringing together of many disciplines to create a theory of congruence and transformation (of both organization and the individual).  <br /> <br />It is a treasure trove of knowledge and insights, bound to inform, stimulate, and delight anyone who seeks a multidimensional understanding of human organization. Open to any page and you are likely to become absorbed in the rich content that Williams presents.  <br /> <br />The book is deep and rich with substance. It is sure to appeal to those of who are always hunting for those hard-to-find books that go below the surface of facile bullet-points or  'how-to' steps, with little or no mention or concern for the 'why's' or context. As a organization consultant (FutureOrganization.com) I was quickly drawn into this book. I found this book packed with first-rate thinking, cover-to-cover. Very highly recommended.	2005-05-20

After a while, they all seem to be echoing each other. But once in while one comes along that says something different and worthwhile learning. This is one of those books!     Leadership is not all 'goodness and light.' It has it's dark side, with a big range of gray-zone inbetween. Finally, here is a book that explores the dark side. It's not the only one to ever do so, but it sure is one of a rare species.    The author identifies seven dark-side types. Very briefly, these are: 1. Incompetent: lacks the will or skill (or both) to sustain effective action with regard to at least one important leadership challenge; 2. Rigid: stiff and unyielding-unable or unwilling to adapt to new ideas, new information, or changing times; 3. Intemperate: lacks self-control; 4. Callous: uncaring or unkind-ignores or discounts the needs, wants, and wishes of others, especially subordinates; 5. Corrupt: lies, cheats, or steals-puts self-interest ahead of the public interest; 6. Insular: minimizes or disregards the health and welfare of \\"the other\\"-that is, those outside the group or organization for which they are directly responsible; and 7. Evil: commits atrocities. The Kellerman explores each of these types in considerable depth.     The author places bad leadership along two axes, ineffective and unethical, to clarify the word \\"bad.\\"  Kellerman argues that effective and unethical can be joined. A final chapter takes on the challenge of how bad leadership can be stopped, or at least slowed. Kellerman suggests:      * 12 ways for leaders to strengthen their capacity to be both effective and ethical, and      * 8 ways they can work optimally with followers.     She also puts forth 11 ways that followers can fight the good fight against bad leaders and work with each other and their leaders. This chapter is definitly a feel-good wrap-up; it is the light at the end of a very dark tunnel...a brief chapter, but packing a to-the-point, up-beat punch.   Great book!	2005-05-20

This book can help people break out of the linear, encapsulated world of every-day life, in which most are ensnared and help organizations and networks achieve collective intelligence and formulate future-focused plans.     The book provides a means for engaging with many others in exploring important issues at a variety of levels: group, corporate, community, national, or international. It presents the World Cafe Process (Cafe or WCP), which generally consist of three rounds of progressive conversation, each lasting about 20 or 30 minutes, followed by a dialog among the whole group.     This is the story of the discovery and evolution of the WCP, enabling people to foster constructive dialogue, access collective intelligence, and create innovate possibilities for action.     The process has seven core design principles: set the context; create hospitable space; explore questions that matter; encourage everyone's contribution; cross-pollinate and connect diverse perspectives; listen together for patterns, insights, and deeper questions; and harvest and share collective discoveries. Each chapter begins with a quotation, an illustration, and a question; these give you an overview of the book's themes.     Speaking as a consultant (FutureOrganization.com) I believe that business leaders will find the Cafe a potentially powerful process to increase organizational effectiveness and achieve change. One president of a pharmaceutical company, Yvon Bastien, reports how he successfully used the process to develop the company's long-range business plan. But this story is only one a vast array of successful experiences reported by leaders in all types of organizations.     Chapter 10 provides a guide to successfully hosting a Cafe; it is specific, to-the-point, and very helpful. Closing chapters provide stories of how leaders are using the Cafe, and its societal implications. For further information, the book concludes with a section on resources and connections.     The Cafe concept is very appealling and, from reports, works. It opens the door to learning, creativity and action through a powerful process that deserves consideration by all leaders. As a leader and faciliator of change, this is a book you will want to read. At the very least, Cafe, as a dynamic process, is extremely alluring.	2005-05-17

This book presents the author's assessment of how today's economy, while generating wealth and capable of recovery from recession, is not generating a commensurate expansion in job opportunities. Advances in technology account for this situation, according to Aronomwitz. His analysis and insights boldly and brilliantly challenge the conventional wisdom that technology advancements produce more jobs than they destroy. He also explores the \\"price of neoliberal globalization, the Reagan revolution, the Clinton 'Boom,' and the downsizing of America.\\" Aronowitz also concludes that an agenda is needed to create the conditions that would \\"restore our sense of economic well-being and to reverse the incredible power of large corporations...\\" that, united with political power, is driving down living standards and bringing about an acceptance of authoritarian forms of economic and political rule.    But the author is not technophobic or pessimistic. He is optimistic. He believes what is needed is a reality-based perspective on our economy; one that employs a \\"tight safety net,\\" creates labor-intensive jobs that expand the \\"public good,\\" promotes alternative energy resources, and most importantly, revises our paradigm of \\"full employment\\" and the \\"full-time job.\\" He also sees broader, global implications for this big-picture agenda.     The book offers a compelling, concise case for seeing the U.S. economy (and, contextually, the nation as-a-whole) in a new light, based on solid evidence. This is well-reasoned and robust challenge to 'business-as-usual' economic thinking! It casts a bright light on what may be the 800 pound economic and political guerilla of the 21st century.     If a good nonfiction book is one that informs, stimulates thinking, challenges comfortable mindsets, and sparks the imagination, this one passes the test with flying colors.	2005-05-11

To create this collection the editors contacted thought leaders and asked them \\"What is the future of HR?\\" They responded with the essays that make up this work. Its 45 brief chapters, contributed by 64 HR gurus, cover a broad spectrum of issues confronting the field. The chapters were clustered into nine parts, with the springboard clause of \\"In the future, an effective HR professional must...\\" These nine parts focus on outcomes and results-not actions or activities. This non-tradition (i.e., not based on specialized functions) organization of the book's content captures a dynamic, value-generating spirit. The authors hope they have provided a \\"road map for the profession,\\" spotlighting how HR practitioners can constantly reinvent themselves to continue being of value people, organizations, and societies.     The books' core value is that it encompasses so many key and leading-edge topics written by so many people who are at the forefront of forging the field's future. But each chapter has its own stand alone merit; quite a few have considerable originality and 'push the envelop.' For example, in Chapter 14, \\"Changing Mental Models: HR's Most Important Task,\\" Jeffrey Pfeffer argues that aside from being keepers and analysts of organization culture, HR needs to be concerned with the mental models and mindsets of the people of the company, particularly its leaders. Page-forward to chapter 30; there, Jac Fitz-Enz has a slightly different take; he concludes that to be a strategic business partner, HR leaders must become more culture managers than anything else-\\"there is no better place to start than with the organization's culture.\\" Such thought-provoking views are typical of this book and distinguish it as lively, varied and ambitious collection of substantive thinking. Clearly, this is not  a fast-read; given its agenda and scope-that's a virtue.        As an HR consultant and practitioner (HRconsultant.com, Partner, Stern & Associates), as well as a reviewer, I findthis book to be a valuable, valid, and vivid snapshot of where the HR field is, where it's likely to be heading, and the many challenges it's confronting. No question about it, there's a lot of rewarding reading in this book.	2005-04-27

This book is about how employees actually interact through networks to get work done, how such social networks function, how to analyze these networks, and ways to build and strengthen them. The major focus is on information flow and collaboration. The authors have found that a highly effective and pragmatic approach to analyzing and developing networks need not be highly complex. Their focus is on improving organizational performance by both understanding and promoting vibrant networks. The book concentrates on the factors that make a network effective and how, in practice, managers can foster the potential of a social network within and between units of organization. The discussion of factors that infuse energy into a network is excellent. So too are sections on the elements used to promote network connectivity and the six steps for conducting a social network analysis, including example questions. Based on considerable research and real-world experiences in private and public sector entities, the book is outstanding in revealing a key dimension of organizational success. It is well written, makes main points clearly, and delves into the substance of its subject.

This ambitious resource is bursting with 62 contributions clustered into seven parts:   1) Understanding the Skilled Facilitator Approach-main focus: summarizes the approach and describes its major principles and features (8 chapters)   2) Starting Out-main focus: using TSF in a variety of basic ways (12 chapters)   3) Deepening Your Practice-main focus: refining intervention and diagnosis skills, and increasing personal awareness (7 chapters)   4) Facing Challenges-main focus: dealing with the most difficult situations (5 chapters)  5) Seeking Your Path-main focus: integrating the TSF approach in practice and life (5 chapters)  6) Leading and Changing Organizations-main focus: creating major change in leadership and organizational functioning (15 chapters)   and   7) Integrating the Skilled Facilitator Approach in Your Worklife (and Non-Worklife)-main focus: shows how to integrate TSF with other approaches and roles (coach, trainer, consultant, leader, parent) (10 chapters)    The book is further enriched with: definitions; key points; examples; tools and techniques and samples of the outcomes they produce; reflections; model conversations; and resources.     As a consultant in organizational analysis, design and change, as well as a reviewer, I was particularly drawn to Chapter 51, \\"Do Surveys Provide Valid Information for Organizational Change?\\" by Peg Carlson. She concludes what we have  found to be true of surveys-they are useful for spotlighting likely issues but they do not deliver the depth of analysis and meaning required in organizational consulting, nor the motivation for learning and deep change. This chapter is emblematic of the books' quality of content. In a nutshell, this book is outstanding!  I highly recommend it.	2005-04-20

You should not have to compete in the red ocean of head-to-head competition; the alternative is to create a new space in the market that will attract new customers. Such a strategy involves value innovation-the cornerstone of blue ocean strategy. Those that seek blue oceans pursue differentiation and low cost simultaneously. The authors studied 150 strategic moves between 1880 and 2000-not companies or industries-to understand the patterns by which blue oceans are created and high performance is achieved. The authors' aim is to make the formulation and execution of blue ocean strategy as systematic and actionable as traditional competition. The book goes on to examine six principles of blue ocean strategy, discussed from page 21 onward, ending with a brief chapter on sustainability and renewal of blue ocean strategy. As a consultant in organization and compensation (Stern & Associates), I was particularly impressed with how this book incisively addresses the HUMAN side of strategy execution. The authors have written a wonderfully clear and insightful book that sheds a bright light on the alternative to traditional strategy. It is filled with ideas to savor.	2005-04-19

The subject of this book is how to develop a unity of purpose that melds \\"the desire to excel, to accomplish something important, and to act in a decent and responsible way.\\" The author calls this \\"the moral advantage.\\" Based on 48 interviews with successful executives, Damon identifies the key strategies of a moral approach to business and shows how these can lead to both personal and financial success. Damon's focus is on the morality shared by people of goodwill who act decently, live honorably, care for others, and are fair, honest, and responsible. The moral advantage is further defined as \\"a positive way of thinking about morality that transforms both the worker and the work, a powerful force that can propel people toward their own goals while at the same time generating great benefits for society.\\" The author builds a four-dimensional concept of morality in business and presents a discussion of people whose careers in business exemplify the moral advantage. Damon concludes the book with ten principles distilled from his research. The book presents a refreshing and inspiring value-based framework for understanding business and personal success.	2005-04-19

Toxic leaders leave their followers worse off than they found them. A few of the many other ways toxic leaders act are they: violate basic standards of human rights; feed followers illusions; stifle criticism; maliciously set constituents against one another. The book shows how these leaders win people over by playing on their fears and self-esteem, only to ultimately use their power against their own followers. The book explores, in depth, how people are drawn into accepting, even embracing toxic leaders, and how these leaders retain power. This is an enlightening probe into the psyche of people and how their culture, situation, deepest fears, and dysfunctional personalities, make them vulnerable to toxic leaders. The book also explores ways of dealing with these leaders: counsel them to change; undermine them; join with others to confront or overthrow them. The book closes with a chapter on how to be freed of toxic leaders, by facing up to our anxiety and the accompanying pain, as well as by bringing nontoxic leaders to the fore. The author's insights apply to leaders of all kinds, political and business. This brief review does no justice to the breadth and depth of this work.To read this book is to help become aware of, and armed against, toxic leaders of all types. Required reading for all who yearn and strive to live free of domineering, destructive leaders. Our highest recommendation.	2005-04-18

The essays present a vast array of ideas, insights and guidance for managers seeking to understand the organizations and environments they must interact with to be successful. The book, as a whole, presents an enormous amount of knowledge but, more importantly, aims to affect how managers think-impacting their perspective and the lens (paradigm) through which they understand and take action.

The theme is \\"(u)sing theory allows us to see the future more clearly and act more confidently to shape our destiny.\\" Using case studies, the authors outline a model, diagnostics and tools to allow decision makers to spot industry-changing firms or business models, forecast winners and losers, and assess the merits and implications of specific strategic choices. The book's foundation is built on the premise that \\"(t)he best way to make accurate sense of the present, and the best way to look into the future, is through the lens of theory. Good theory provides a robust way to understand important developments, even when data is limited. And theory is even more important when there is an abundance of data. ...

The authors' aim is to teach readers how to use the theories of innovation to predict industry change. The central elements of the authors' approach are: tracking the signals of change; sizing up competitors; and identifying which choices matter.

At the outset, Avolio asserts that leadership is both made and born; a person's beliefs about leadership can, however, become self-fulfilling and self-limiting. Learning and leading must go hand in hand for a person to achieve his/her full leadership potential. Thankfully, this author believes that the development of authentic leadership is more profound than a listing of do's and don'ts; he is true to his ambition. In each chapter Avolio discusses one main concept that makes up an overall model of leadership development with the aim of conveying a new model for the reader. The context of the model is each person's life stream-events that shape their views, used to lead others. The key elements are 1) a person's self and possible self (perspective of self), 2) perspective of others, 3) using feedback to adjust behavior, 4) mistakes and trust, and 5) the merging of leadership and technology. Avolio then looks at the state-of-art of leadership development today, examines strategic leadership development, and presents a model that predicts performance and can be used for development.  The final chapter provides supporting research for each preceding chapter. The hallmark of this book is its in-depth treatment of the subject. It is loaded with rich content. This is a masterful work on an complex subject.	2005-04-13

Competency-based HR management focuses first on the person and then on his or her outputs or results. With all aspects of HR integrated through competencies, rather than through jobs and work activities, the organization has a competency-based HR system. Competencies are enduring while work activities and tasks are transitory, therefore, the book proposes that a person- versus job-oriented perspective makes good sense. Additionally, the authors present a strong business case for taking the competency-based approach to HRM. Driven by six macro economic, technology and business trends, the competency needs of most organizations are discussed. In response to these trends, HR practitioners must assume responsibility  for leading the way in their organizations to add value; the competency-base approach is the single most useful approach to achieving this central goal. For planning and implementing a customer-driven competency-base HR management project, a nine-step model is presented. This is the first of several action-oriented models the authors have developed.     Six chapters (representing nearly 55% of the book) are devote to competency-based   1) HR planning, 2) employee recruitment and selection, 3) training, 4) performance management, 5) rewards, and 6) development. Each of these six chapters presents a multi-step model to serve as a guide for implementing the competency-base approach in these six HR areas.     The penultimate chapter that presents a 12-step model for transforming to a competency-based approach to HR management . The final chapter takes a brief peek into the future of competency-based HRM.     This book is highly successful in offering the big picture; in the process it covers a great deal of ground in a very well organized manner, without delving deeply into details that would distract from the theme. We at Stern's Management Review (HRconsultant.com) very strongly  commend this book to all HR professionals.	2005-04-12

Based on 30 years of research, the authors demonstrate a clear relationship between financial performance and employee morale. Data reveals three  dimensions of morale, each having subfactors: 1) equity (job security, compensation, respect), 2) achievement (organization purpose and principles, job enablement, job challenge, and feedback, recognition and reward, and 3) camaraderie (teamwork). Chapters are devoted to each of these subjects and provide illustrative examples. Furthermore, the authors have developed a People Performance Model consisting of: leadership; management practices; employee morale; individual performance, customer satisfaction; customer behavior; and business performance; the model provides an excellent framework for gaining insight into crucial connections. Appendices include a self-assement questionnaire for managers and key statistical findings. Speaking not only as a reviewer, but a management consultant (HRconsultant.com), this book is a gem.

The book spotlights nine hypomanics through our history, and devotes a chapter to each of them, which is both a small biography and a clinical case history.

As we see it, this book is nothing short of a clarion call to action in the face of what will otherwise be the inevitable decline of the U.S. economy. Here's the story. In the course of running Chrysler's procurement and supply activity the author discovered a highly successful cost-containment system, SCORE (Supplier Cost Reduction Effort) that evolved into a concept called Extended Enterprise. The approach was based on collaboration with suppliers. Today, as the U.S. faces a hyper-competitive global economy which is threatening our industrial production, Stallkamp believes that the key to regaining our competitive advantage lies in a commercial system that embraces collaboration rather than continuing to cling to an adversarial approach marked by a negative and domineering relationship with suppliers that yields distrust, tension, and instability. The book explores the collaborative approach and how Chrysler employed this counter-conventional thinking. True collaboration, a genuine collaborative management philosophy, must embrace the entire firm, top to bottom. It enables companies to join together to streamline operations, reduce costs, and accelerate product development. The tools of collaboration offer the power to revitalize our mature and declining industries.	2005-03-29

This book is important because it's message-to succeed you must learn to influence others-is right on target. The authors assert that nobody \\"ever had enough authority (to get their work done).\\" But it is possible to have enough influence to make things happen, and this book's purpose is to tell you how! It shows that the key to influence is reciprocity, which is defined in many and subtle ways. An influence model provides the framework around which the book is organized and developed. Chapters cover influencing: your boss; difficult subordinates; others across functional lines; and colleagues. Other topics include: indirect influence; initiating or leading major change; organizational politics; and escalating to tougher strategies when needed. As consultants in organization analysis, design, and change ([...]) we are keenly aware of the importance and power of the art of influencing others; it is essential to leadership. It is pivotal to getting things done at all levels, starting with the execution of strategy. It is good to find a book that addresses this crucial topic. Overall, the authors offer a penetrating treatment of their subject which serves as a great guide to the art of influencing others.

This book puts a bright light on how and why an effective workforce strategy is crucial for the execution of business strategy. This vital link is explored in depth. The authors show how building on the HR function links to building the effective workforce which drives business success. The four elements of the scorecard form a series of building blocks culminating in strategy execution: 1) workforce mind-set and culture, 2) workforce competencies; 3) leadership and workforce behavior; and 4) workforce success. Ideally, workforce success is measured by its impact on business success (carrying out strategy). An extensive list of  metrics is provided for these four elements. The authors bring together the HR scorecard, the workforce scorecard, and the balanced scorecard.  There is an extensive discussion of strategy execution and also of the role of communication and learning programs. A final chapter provides a diagnostic tool for assessing the big picture-the capability to manage and measure the human capital dimension of strategy execution.  <br /> <br />Finally, someone has got it right! As a reviewer, as well as a consultant (hrconsultant.com), I have seen HR fixated on measuring costs rather than profit-generating business results. This book helps us get away from seeing people exclusively as a cost (to be reduced, even if it's self-defeating) and turns to the the fact that people are the key value-creating asset. This is a terrrific book that makes it crystal clear: people turn strategy into business results...MEASURE THAT and maybe, just maybe, the light will dawn for top executives!	2005-03-09

The Scorecard approach enables the managing of HR as a strategic asset and demonstrates HR's contributions to financial success, A Scorecard helps put cost control (HR's efficiency measure) into balance with HR's value creation through focusing on: (1) the HR deliverables (e.g., providing excellent staffing) that leverage HR's role in achieving business strategy; (2) the High-Performance Work System (i.e., HR systems that enable deliverables); and (3) the HR systems' alignment with strategy. A central theme is that measures of efficiency do not sort out successful from unsuccessful firms; in contrast, the Scorecared emphasizes value creation tempered by efficiency. This book shows how to develop a Scorecard tailored for a specific organization. It also explores the competencies needed to implement the concept and provides guidelines.

In today's chaotic and extremely competitive environment, organizational leaders need to go beyond classical analytical thinking and have a feel for business realities. This is the impetus for this book. Drawing upon the thinking, style, and actions of such top executives as Jack Welch and Andy Grove, the author examines the role of emotion and philosophy in making critical decisions.     This book examines the process of moving beyond the scientific approach to management. The author explores philosophic conceptions of management, shows how some trends in management theory imply a philosophical rather than scientific framework, and develops a concept of education appropriate for the transition from a tradition analytical to a philosophical view of management. The book challenges conventional management thinking and spotlights a more existential mindset that is viewed as in harmony with todays' business challenges that demand creativity and radical leaps of thought, throwing down the gauntlet to conventional management thinking, forged in the Industrial Revolution. This is a highly original and thoughtful work. As Segal writes, management is \\"caught between the collapse of an old way of doing things and the not-yet of a new set of conventions or habits. A question that we need to ask is: how do we operate when we do not have road signs to guide us? Indeed how do we begin to establish new road signs? It is in this context that philosophy becomes significant. ...it is where we do not have a framework to describe our experiences that the passion and 'motive' for being philosophical begins.\\" Segal takes the reader into this new realm and sheds a bright light upon its dark, nonlinear nature.	2005-02-27

This book tells the stories of a unique group of managers who have mastered the art of making things happen: execution.Their stories and the lessons learned are presented around four building blocks which are the components crucial to following through: 1) having a clear direction, 2) matching the right people to every goal, 3) getting started with lots of 'buy-in,' and 4) ensuring everyone maintains momentum by increasing individual initiative.

Based on  a study of 3,104 knowledge workers in the U.S. and 9 other countries, the author has identified the qualities of high-performing groups, i. e., those that get financial results, through being the best in developing and introducing new products, services and markets. The overall conclusion is that knowledge workers who work in environments in which 1) they are valued, 2) can do their best thinking, and 3) have the freedom to seize opportunities, constitute high-performing work groups. Such groups are adaptable, knowledgeable, and resourceful. The book goes into many factors that explain the success of these groups, offering many case examples drawn from the extensive research. The insights of this book are readily accessible. The book is written in a to-the-point, very readable style. But most importantly, it offers some mind-broadening findings that, for some, may appear to be a challenge to conventional thinking. Speaking as an organization consultant ([...] as well as a reviewer, this book shines forth as offering some solid, although not altogether surprising, conclusions.

Bakke presents a very personal account of his 20 years spent building a highly successful multi-billion dollar company centered on the values of integrity, fairness, having fun, and being socially responsible. Bakke's view is that these values made his company financially successful, a result which he views as a second-ranked goal.     While the book is truly the tale of a CEO's adventure, we at Stern's Management Review Online ([...]) find it to be a unique portrayal of the creation of a values-driven enterprise. Don't let the title fool you...this work goes far beyond \\"joy.\\" Cutting through Bakke's excellent storytelling and quantum-leaping to the back of the book, we found that the author thoughtfully offers the reader a to-the-point profile of 49 items (Appendix A, The Joy at Work Approach) arranged under the following headings: treatment of employees; purpose, mission, goal; annual reports; leaders and managers; compensation; education, training and information; auditing; and board of directors.

We enjoy well organized books that get to the point: this is one of them. In a nutshell, the work, based on interviews with leaders, offers practical wisdom and highlights 10 essential competencies of effective leaders: 1) seeing what is, in a new way; 2) vision; 3) storytelling (conveying a compelling message); 4) fostering hope (creating a sense of the possible through optimism); 5) rendering significance (connecting vision with each person's life goals); 6) mobilizing (encouraging right actions, setting high expectations, letting go, encouraging the best in others); 7) self awareness; 8) emotional engagement (empathic connection); 9) enacting beliefs; and 10) centering (developing centering consciousness and improvising). These highlights don't do justice to the book. In its content-rich pages, it delivers an abundance of insights about the meaning of leadership, as well as revealing an inspiring spirit.	2005-02-23

STERN'S MANAGEMENT REVIEW FINDS this a book that places leadership in a new light. According to the author, inner leadership consists of leading from the middle of the organization, generating the vital energy that drives organizational dynamics, in contrast to top leadership. The book explores the characteristics of inner leadership, which relies on the relationship with followers and on inspiration, not motivation. <br />Some key factors in the psycho-dynamics of inner leadership include: mutual interactive trust; internalized feelings of caring, respect, and enjoyment in working with others; willingness to serve the needs of followers; a quest for problem-finding in contrast to problem solving; and in general, a building of deep connections with others. These qualities stand in contrast to reliance on the formal power of authority-a hallmark of top leadership. The book goes into 21 techniques of inner leadership, devoting a chapter to each. <br />This book is rich with insights and ideas. As consultants in organization and compensation (founding partners of Stern &amp; Associates, as well as editors of Stern's Management Review Online), we find Fairholm's book raises some key questions: Do organizations recognize the role and value of the vital leadership in the middle? Do they know how to select and develop inner leaders? Can they measure their performance and motivate and reward them? Intentionally or not, book provides a framework for addressing these questions.<br />Chapters end with discussion issues and questions, and developmental activities. Fairholm treats his subject matter with attention to details and nuances. 308 pp.	2003-12-20

Based on a study of highly successful companies, the authors have identified nine domains of differentiation, all of which can be copied. What is unique are new ways to create a positive chemistry with  customers through four major areas of behavioral differentiation. These are: 1) Operational: institutionalizing behavior through practices, policies, procedures, and employee education and training. 2) interpersonal: interpersonal skills and attitude. 3) Exceptional: when employees go out of their way to help customers; 4) symbolic: behavior that reflects the company's key product, service, or messages and values (aligning the company's behaviors with it's intended image and promises). The book gives examples that show ways winning organizations create these behavior differentiations. While most of the book is devoted to B2C companies, a chapter also addresses B2B firms.

It introduces coaching and cross-cultural concepts, provides a framework for integrating coaching and cultural perspectives, and examines numerous cultural orientations. Rosinski presents a Culture Orientations Framework to assess and profile culture, and a Global Scorecard to help set targets at all levels.

This book reflects the author's belief that problems of theoretical coherence, utilization and effectiveness of HRM practices can best be addressed by an evolutionary perspective, including sociocultural evolution and evolutionary psychology. The title reflects the view that successful HRM practices must emerge in the context of the organization and its environment; there is no one best way. The author's aim is to show that the mechanical perspective in HRM, which presumes that expert-designed interventions will produce intended outcomes, has outlived its usefulness and discusses ways an evolutionary approach can be applied, specifically in hiring and training.

This book is a collaborative work by a philosophy professor (Koestenbaum) and a management consultant (Block) that examines an array of philosophical and psychological subjects and ties them to the role of leadership and the nature and experience of work. At its core, it is about what it means to be human in the real world. The purpose of the book is to explore the ideas of existential philosophy, and associated ideas in psychology, in the context of everyday life, particularly at work. It covers such topics as freedom, anxiety, death and evil, and links these to how we think and act. The main theme is what it means to be free and the linkage to accountability. This is not your typical book about work or management. It is about the way each of us encounters the world, experiences living, and defines ourselves. It has deep implications for personal transformation and our interaction with reality. The book is intellectually challenging, mind-expanding, and very thought-provoking, providing fundamental implications for managing people, guidance, counselling, and personal growth.	2003-07-18

These are five quintessential dimensions of courage that bring people to cross an action threshold and persevere. Each of these factors is explored in separate chapters; specific how-to guidelines are presented and summarized. The book vividly deals with the emotions underlying the will to act; it is insightful and invigorating. We highly recommend it.	2003-07-09

They assert that creating understanding for the need for change, building momentum, and perhaps scoring some initial successes in the first 100 days greatly increases chances for success. Successful change calls for Winning Conditions, the book's core framework, consisting of: correct diagnosis of the change challenge; early development of shared understanding; enrichment of shared understanding; establishing a sense of urgency; creating a limited, focused, strategic agenda; rapid, strategic decision making and deployment; a human flywheel of commitment; identifying and managing sources of resistance; follow-through on changing organizational enablers; and demonstrated leadership commitment. Discussion and examples make this approach clear and show how it's applied. The authors are careful to distinguish between different types (or depths) of intervention. The book is outstanding in its scope and quality of thought. It is highly informative, gets to the meat of ideas clearly and quickly, and gives the reader solid value from start to finish.	2003-07-03

This is an enlightening, to-the-point, and highly absorbing probe of the role of the board. The author pulls no punches as he explores the rising power of CEOs and why boards fail. The book reveals how many recent business disasters are due to ignorance, strategic incompetence, and personal cowardice at the board level, along with the rise of the \\"celebrity CEO.\\" <br />Garratt does more than point up the core problems; he shows how boards can re-establish their governance role and primary loyalty to the company as a legal personality. Garratt's main aims for change are assessing board performance, developing a learning board, and professionalizing the board. Distinctions between UK and US boards are made, but Garratt sees boards in both countries facing the same root issues. <br />This is a book that really delivers knowledge and keen observations. We at Stern's Management Review Online hrconsultant.com find that the author's views are carefully argued and gutsy, and his conclusions and direction for change are strategic, forward-looking, and challenging to those at the top. THIN ON TOP is THICK with insights and ideas. Must reading for directors, top executives, and other stakeholders.	2003-05-29

This book  challenges the traditional knee-jerk response of the cost-cutting mentality and charts a better way to organizational success in hard times. Based on extensive research on the approaches companies take to restructuring, Cascio has found a huge distinction between those that see people as a cost (the downsizers) versus assets to be developed (the responsible restructurers). The book presents an analysis of the financial consequences of alternative restructuring strategies in terms of profitability and attractiveness as an investment. Cascio exposes the myths about downsizing and presents the hard facts. He examines the approaches of the responsible restructurers, i.e., high-performance work practices...and explores the practices and experiences of many companies.

This book presents study findings and provides an in-depth discussion on the question of whether or not extrinsic rewards negatively affect intrinsic motivation. The authors conclude, on the basis of over 100 experimental investigations, that there is no support to the claim that rewards produce significant and substantial decreases in people's intrinsic interest. They also conclude that rewards can be used to enhance performance and motivation. This is a scholarly work of outstanding quality and clearly addresses a controversy that, to this day, divides people in management. As a management consultant specializing in compensation, I highly recommend this book to every practitioner, academic and author/expert who would rid the world of pay for performance; I hope they have the intrinsic motivation to read it with an open mind-if so, I believe they will be rewarded for their effort.	2002-07-25

Rather than plunge into some recipe for organizational change, this book shows how to understand an organization from many perspectives. Based on this knowledge, a strategy for change can be developed. In addition to examples of proposals, letters to employees, interview questions, and feedback reports, the book presents an excellent assessment outline for use on-site.

Using this basis, Sanders sets forth a three stage approach: 1) learn as much as possible and share that knowledge; 2) grow the largest network of contacts possible; and 3) open up these contacts to help others and be the most compassionate person you can become. Success will follow. While the message seems simple enough, you really need to read the book to fully fathom Sanders' thinking. The ideas are applicable to all walks of life.

This absorbing and probing book explores the biological drives that explain our choices and behavior. Bridging the gap between evolutionary biology and the social sciences, this extraordinary interdisciplinary work shows that our actions are a consequence of a continuous struggle between four innate, subconscious, brain-based drives. These are the drive to: acquire objects and experiences; bond with others in long-term relationships of mutual care and commitment; learn and make sense of the world and of ourselves; and to defend ourselves, our loved ones, beliefs and resources from harm. A very interesting chapter applies this concept to work and organization. The authors present a model to explain human behavior and reveal a common heritage of all humans.

He places, and links together, the study of organization and change initiatives into the context of cutting-edge transformations in physics, evolutionary biology, and the study of the brain/mind that are changing our view of reality. <br />The quantum organization is profiled by seven attributes including: inclusion of consciousness in self-designing systems; cross-boundary processes; and, internal commitment of active participants. Kilmann presents a five-stage process for closing the gap between the old and the new (i.e., quantum) organization. <br />The author delves into the primary change initiatives for achieving self-transformation consisting of quantum infrastructures, formal systems, and process management. Eight tracks are used to address these three components. These tracks concern: culture, skills, teams, strategy-structure, reward system, learning process, gradual process (continuous improvement on a unit level), and radical process (cross-boundary redesign on the macro level). <br />Self-awareness and growth are critical in the overall scheme. This emphasis on the individual makes this a highly unique work. Stern's Management Review Online (hrconsultant) finds this book to be fascinating, eclectic, and HIGHLY innovative in its approach to deep organizational change. The liberal use of full-color, lively diagrams greatly helps convey the meaning of key concepts. <br />The author has tried to bring together just about everything having to do with organizational transformation into one grand design; we believe he has been successful. For those searching for a different perspective on organization, out to 'push the envelop,' this is a book well worth your time. Highly recommended.	2001-07-27

This book on leadership, well grounded in research, distinguishes itself by seeking to move the study of leadership forward through  integrating literature from the strategic management area and psychological literature. <br />The book's key theme is that understanding leadership requires fathoming the contextual dynamics underlying and driving it. These dynamics give rise to critical periods when organizational effectiveness demands leadership-specific leadership moments. <br />The chapters explore seven leadership performance imperatives: (1) cognitive (information processing and problem-solving); (2) social (interpersonal skills, roles); (3) personal (e.g., career and image management); (4) political (cultivating and using of power); (5) technological (use and impact of technology); (6) financial; and (7) senior staffing (recruiting, assessing, developing people). <br />Each essay represents insightful thinking. The chapter on behavioral complexity and social intelligence, for example, concludes that there are the four key qualities of executive leadership work: co-option of stakeholders, foresight, systems thinking, and the creation of structure. This is just a snippet, but, hopefully, gives you some sense of the book's richness. This is a first-rate book on leadership! Stern's Management Review Online highly recommends it. We believe that this collection of essays provides a significant contribution to understanding the nature and dynamics of leadership. Its overall quality, organization, and, most importantly, wealth of thoughtful content make this book a top-notch addition to any business library.	2001-07-24

The major subject areas covered are: finance; marketing; production; technology and innovation; human resource management, management effectiveness, culture and structure; and information systems. The authors also take a process orientation that cuts across departments or functions, avoiding the trap of thinking that optimizing performance in each part will lead to an optimal performance of the whole. The book also explores benchmarking, comments on reengineering, and examines the value chain approach. Another approach that is explored is core competencies and their related critical success factors and core capabilities, all cutting across the whole organization. Additionally, a chapter is devoted to conducting an industry analysis. The book concludes with insights about involving managers and drawing all findings together.

This is a thoughtful and thought-provoking book that examines the nature of irresistible growth enterprises-those able to routinely employ the momentum of inexorable external forces, such as technology advances and shifts in markets. Such agile organizations can use these forces as tailwinds (sources of power or energizers) for creating and implementing 2.000 percent solutions-ones that produce 20 times or more the benefit or speed of the run-of-the-mill variety. <br />Mitchell and Coles, authors of &quot;The 2,000 Percent Solution,&quot; explain that to benefit from irresistible forces an organization must ALIGN itself with them (like a pivoting windmill with the wind), break itself of bad thinking habits that block or evade action (discussed in considerable depth), and, using an eight-step process (a chapter is devoted to each step) replace these hobbling habits of the mind with desirable, action-oriented ones. <br />In a nutshell, the challenge is to (1) identify, anticipate, adapt to, and, in some instances, create irresistible forces; (2) learn to flexibly align to them; and (3) develop capabilities to strengthen the enterprises's power to act. Lively, highly readable, well constructed, insightful content make this a most valuable book. Highly recommended.	2001-02-23

Drawing on the his experience, the author goes beyond the typical meaning of &quot;corporate identity&quot; to show that organizations have prospered by understanding and embracing their unique value-creating characteristics.  <br />Ackerman sets forth and explores eight laws of identity which he has  discerned: (1) the law of being: any organization composed of one or more  human beings is alive in its own right, exhibiting capacities that derive  from, but transcend, the individuals who make up the organization over  time. (2) The law of individuality: an organization's human capacities  invariably fuse into a discernible identity that makes that organization  unique. (3) The law of constancy: identity is fixed, transcending time and  space, while its manifestations are constantly changing. (4) The law of  will: every organization is compelled by the need to create value in  accordance with its identity. (5) The law of possibility: identity  foreshadows potential. (6) Law of relationship: organizations are  inherently relational, and those relationships are only as strong as the  natural alignment between the identities of the participants (7) The law of  comprehension: the individual capacities of an organization are only as  valuable as the perceived value of the whole of that organization. (8) The  law of the cycle: identity governs values, which produces wealth, which  fuels identity. <br />These laws give insights into a firm's value creating  characteristics, enabling unique self-identity to be defined, and forming  the basis for aligning strategic development and day-to-day operations with  the organization's identity. In unfolding the nature of identity, the  author finds powerful similarities between individuals and organizations.  In this way, the Ackerman finds the inner core of organization viewed as a  livining being.  This is an intriguing book; highly recommended.

This is an enormously engrossing study of the nature and evolution of the brain and of today's digital technology revolution. In examining the brain and its silicon creations, the workings, potential and uniqueness of BOTH  are explored in detail, along with the challenge that computers can reach  mind-like thinking with artificial intelligence, neural computing and fuzzy  logic. <br />With clarity and brilliant insights, Jonscher shows the limits of  technology's reach toward mind-like thinking, making a compelling argument  that no machine can ever rival the complexities and subtleties of the  brain; that no digital device will ever answer a question that lies outside  of the 'computable' category. Thinking is not purely mechanical, the author  concludes, and the brain is something which  cannot be fully understood,  let alone replicated, by applying its own capacities. <br />But this book does  more than take on the Big Question -will computers ever think like people?;  it opens the reader's mind to the realities of THINKING, within the dynamic  context of four billion years of evolution and our evolving Knowledge  Society. This is an enlightening, entertaining, and very accessible work. A  powerful book that deftly handles ideas and issues of mind-challenging  proportions. Very highly recommended.

Bhide delves into the nature and dynamics of entrepreneurial firms and entrepreneurs.  The purpose of this well-researched and highly detailed book is to integrate and present the authors ideas, developed over many  years of study, to help individuals start and grow their own businesses.  The work brings together the experiences of several hundred entrepreneurs  to examine what these people do and to understand their role in the context  of markets and the economy. The author also strives to explain  entrepreneurial success, concluding that profitability in small business  may be more a function of tactical hustle than solid long-term strategy;  persistence may outweigh detailed planning in importance. These conclusions  ring true to us based on our own organization and compensation consulting  experience with entrepreneurial enterprises. <br />The book addresses the  nature of opportunities entrepreneurs pursue, their problems and tasks,  traits and skills they need, and social and economic contributions they  make.

The title of this book could have been &quot;putting people into the heart of the organizational change equation.&quot; In its well written pages, the author shows how to engage, liberate and develop an organizations's human  potential. <br />MegaChange describes a process of transformation based on  assumptions of human capability, rather than limitations. The approach  focuses on people (below the top) and assumes that they have valid input,  can be trusted, and can play a vital role in the change process. Key themes  are: greater emphasis on human values, goals, capabilties, and efficacy;  placing people at the center of strategy, structure and systems;  approaching change from a top-down-bottom-up sequence of development  activities, involving two parallel, synergistic efforts: (1)  strategy-driven, organization-wide transition in systems and structures and  (2) a transformation in culture, beginning with the workforce. <br />The main  body of the book is devoted to explaining this change process.

In large part, this is a personal account of the development of VISA as told by its founder and CEO Emeritus. It is also the author's personal quest for understanding the nature of society today and the reasons for the  failure of so many organizations. He presents his ideas about the birth of  a new age filled with accelerating change and disorder which requires  organizations that can operate at the thin edge between chaos and order.  <br />Hock introduces the concept of chaordic, an adjective referring to the  behavior of any self-governing organism, organization or system which  blends elements of order and chaos. Chaordic organization is one able to  maintain a harmonious order-disorder balance, characterized by principles  of evolution; its nature includes being self-organizing, self-governing,  adaptive, and nonlinear. <br />Hock uses his business experience as a  springboard to put forward ideas about chaordic organization which include:  they have no destination or ultimate being-only becoming; they incorporate  inherent paradox and conflict; they are driven by a deep conviction and  shared understanding of the Purpose of a community from which all else  flows (profit is not, according the Hock, a Purpose); and they apply  principles that are an expression of behavior in the pursuit of Purpose.  <br />The full scope of Hock's thinking encompasses the environment, society,  and individuals. This book is a mixture of subtle concepts, insights into  organization, and a well told tale (in detail) of the evolution of an idea  into a major business enterprise. Hock's deeper insights are intriguing.  <br />The book will be immensely rewarding for those interested in delving  into reflective thinking about the evolving nature of organization.

Albrecht has written about environmental scanning in &quot;The Northbound Train&quot; (AMACOM, 1994) in which he focused on vision, strategy and values. In this work he explores the scanning process and creates a  conceptual breakdown of the environment into eight critical  sub-environments. These are: customers, competitors, economy, technology,  society, politics, law, and geophysical. <br />These environmental sectors are  different for each organization and need to be defined. He stresses the  interconnectiveness of these sectors; many key phenomena cut across their  boundaries, which are artificial. The value of dividing the environment  into sectors is only to facilitate the process of analysis. <br />The author  begins with a discussion of the environmental scan, an examination of the  new realities of business today and Toffler's Third Wave, and provides  insights on how to think like a futurist. The remaining chapters explore  each of the eight sub-environments (strategic radar screens) to glean what  can be useful in growing a successful enterprise. <br />The final chapter  focuses on the issue of thinking strategically, as well as paying attention  to immediate priorities (the author dubs this bifocal vision). This chapter  examines how to extract and share meaning from the messages received from  scanning, resulting in a document-the Basic Annual Strategic Estimate. He  then returns to the highlights of the strategic planning process as  presented in the &quot;The Northbound Train&quot; and very briefly sketches  the dynamics of a strategic retreat or conference.and strategy  formulation-these are not, however, main topics of this book. <br />This is a  well written, absorbing, and informative work that succeeds in its aim of  helping to make sense out of today's world of discontinuous change and  outright chaos. It offers a template for exploring the environment and  thinking about the future and, ultimately, identifying critical truths and  insights, and prioritizing issues. Albrecht's final admonition is that  environmental scanning is not a scientific process but guesswork. His book,  however, greatly helps to lessen the guesswork-to lift the thick fog that  usually enshrouds efforts to understand an organization's current and  future environment. Highly recommended.

Based on focus group research, the authors provide extensive guidelines for managers to retain employees. The authors present 26 specific actions managers can take, using a chapter to discuss each one. Each chapter  contains a 'to do' list, brief illustrative stories, examples of retention  work done by the authors' for clients, excerpts from an exit interview, as  well as some linkages between chapters. <br />The book down-plays the role of  money. This is okay to the extent that too many firms think money is the  'be all and end all' of retention. Money is not, but the danger is that too  many firms lull themselves into thinking that since money is not the number  one factor driving turnover according to surveys, they can cut corners with  compensation ( often, however, with the exception of pay packages at  executive levels-consider the implicit contradiction in that). Long-term,  firms that pay below competitive rates reap what they sow...marginal  organizational performance. In our consulting experience we find reward  systems and retention are powerfully linked. The role of compensation can  work in strange and mysterious ways-and sometimes not so mysterious. People  are complex. <br />We wished that the authors gave a bit more attention to the  economics of retaining people. They do make the point of paying fairly and  competitively in chapter18, but the message is muted. But since this book  is addressed to managers, and most managers have little-to-no meaningful  influence on compensation decision-making (despite all the empowerment  talk), the treatment of pay is understandable. <br />This is a super book that  focuses on the many highly important non-cash elements of retaining people.  In doing so, it succeeds admirably. In short, this is a neatly organized,  clearly written, how-to book. By way of recommendation, we will use it as a  resource in our own organization/management development consulting work.  This book should be read by anyone who manages people.
