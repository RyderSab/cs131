Now he may pay. He is also someone you hope will get whats coming to him before the book ends. Kathy Baker, a probation officer, ends up being the girl he wants. An alligator makes  the scene, scaring Bobs wife into leaving. Elvin and Dale Crowe Jr. are the real bad men, mainly Elvin. They are funny as well as bad. The book moves very slowly in lots of places. I never did find out what happened to Crown Jr. It justs leave a lot to be desired. Leonard has done better. The ending could have been better if one more person had been taken care of. Which one? Have to read to see.	2002-10-30

Can Luke find all the powers behind the killing? A fairly fast moving western. I gave it a four instead of a five because several pages are all talk with out much going on. As a whole it will hold your attention. I like Lukes brand of justice. It is much better than some we have today.	2002-10-27

Joe Pepper, not his real name, tells his own story in this book, He has done a little of everything, some good and a lot bad. He has been on both sides of the law, serving as a deputy and also killing people. He says he never killed a man except in self defense of one that needed killing. He tells how he got the name Joe Pepper. His is now in jail for killing man and is to hang. He tells his story to a preacher. The book is only fair in my openion. Have read several Kelton books and most are better than this one. I got tired of it long before it was done. Did not grab me and make me want to continue reading.

All done by vampires no less. It is so bad. No real story except Alex trying to catch them. Just killing after killing. I really hate this. I liked James Patterson so much.

Luke Starbuck is hired to find out who is behind the Wells Fargo robbies in Arizona. He is lead to believe it is Wyatt Earp and his brothers along with Doc Holladay. He becomes aware this is true and sets out to find some waya to stop him. His plan is to get Wyatt and his brothers fighting against the ones who actually do the robberies. He is determined to stop or kill Wyatt Earp. The book is fast moving. I question anyone being able to do what Starbuck does in the book. If this is a half way true story,it changes my mind on the character of Wyatt Earp and his brothers. I had always thought them to be law enforcement people who were on the up and up, but maybe not. A statment in the front of the book says while the actions may have been changed a little, all else is closer to the truth and the myth. Who am I to say. You will have to read and decide for yourself.	2002-10-16

I have read everything by Jason Manning I have found and I don't think I ever read a bad book. The Long Hunters is no exception. This is a story about Lt. Timothy Barlow and his service to his country. It takes four years of his live and packs it into this book. He serves in the Army put he also feels for the Indian people. It is also the story of Andrew Jackson and the way he treated the Indians who were his friends and fought with him. He was quite the villian. This goes from the battle against the Creeks to his battles against the British and French. It is also a story about Rook, an Indian raised up with white people, he wants to fight to protect his family and thats all. The last half of the book is much better than the first, it moves much quicker and will hold your attention better.

There was some few very good pages but most of the pages seemed to be just talk. People would spend page after page talkng about what was gong on or thinking and talking about what had happened to them in the past. Much to slow moving for me. Also to unbelieveable. I think things do go on in our government that are wrong but this is so far out it is unreal. No need to talk about the characters as I did not even finish the book, yes, I did give it a chance, read to page 300 and thought that was enough. Very, very slow moving!!!!!!	2002-09-29

Carella does not think Corwin was the killer and sets out to prove it. There are many twist and turns. Kling is beaten up by some men. He does not know why or who. Is this connected to the murder? It is a good case of police work and running tips down. McBain writes so you can feel like you are there and can see the action. Who was the killer? Will Kling find out who beat him up?

He wants all the land belonging to the amall ranchers. Mark finds Jacy Kincaid who tell him his all about his brother being killed a few years ago and the trouble with King. Mark thinks he would like to be with Suzanne Magnusssen, Kings daughter but he soon finds out better. Randall Magnussen, Kings son, is the cause of a lot of the problems, he and a hired hand have killed several people but never been caught. Mark settles in to avenge his brothers death and settle down. Jose Luis del Toro appears. He is a Mexican gunman and has a list of people King wants killed, after a little Mark is at the top of the list. The book has some pages of good fast action. I thing it is about Jed Gibbon, the Sheriff, and his regaining his self respect as much as Mark. Why the three rating? It has to much sex for my taste. This is only a personal openion. I realize it will help to sell the book but could have been written without it and been much better.	2002-09-25

Hate to be a wet blanket but this one is totally confusing to me. This is the 25th MaBain book I have read. I think I have given all of them a five star except two. This is about 24 hours in the life of the 87th Precinct. There are several cases and several policeman all involved at one time. You read about one case for a page or two, then another one for a page or two, until you go through all of them then you start over again. I like the detectives and I like the 87th Precinct, I did just not like this format. I guess my brain is not large enough to maintain it all and keep it straight. Will continue to read them as  not likeing only two out of twenty five is pretty good.	2002-09-24

Nate and Winona bear down on the four men. Will they get there in time???? They should not have made Winona bad, that was a bad choice. As usual Ezriah messes things up and bad times come to Winona. These books are based on a journal keep by the real Nate King of his experiences in the mountains plus other sources. If you like this time in history and life of the men of the mountain, you will like this series. I do thing many of his other books have been better. Several pages in this one is what people are thinking about, other places and times. To keep the stories going you should start with number one and plow on through.	2002-09-14

Carellla and Kling catch the first one and Myer and Hawes the second. With very good police work the men go after the one or ones who did these two deeds. McBain uses his usual good writing to move the case forward. He makes you feel like you are there and these things can actually happen. There is a very good twist at the end or it was to me.

However, it is very much more about Jake Coak, Quick Charlie Simms and Kate McCorkle than it is Sullivan Hart and Twojack Roth. J. T. Priest has been set free and Judge Parker sends Coak, Simms, Hart and Roth out to destroy Priest and his gang, Los Pistoleros. The first part of the book is devoted to Coak bringing in wanted outlaws then when the four of them are to go after Priest, Coak and Simms take over and have nearly all the action. I did enjoy the book, it is a very good western, just not really about Hart. Jake Coak is great, I hope he show up again with his automatic sawed off rifle. A rare thing to see. Did not like the part of Simms as I think he was a lier most of the time. A fast read, will hold you attention and you won't want to put it down. A few funny places as Priest and his gang to blow a safe and blow up nearly every thinging else instead.	2002-09-01

All the 87th precinct people work on this. Carella considers him to be a \\"master criminal\\"--can he be caught???????? Read as the entire group try to bring this man to justice. As usual McBain writes so you can believe you are there.You get to where you have feelings for each officer and really think you know them.  This is the 22nd book I have read by McBain and I think there was only one I did not like. The odds are pretty good you will like this one also.	2002-08-20

The problem is Espina is the town drunk and the Valley is thought to be owned by ranchers. The two biggest are Travis Richmond and Ben Thompkins. They are not about to allow Espina to claim their land. In steps Judge Earl Stark, who rules the grant is legal and the property is owned by Espina. There are attempts to get the grant and destroy it. There is also murder involved. The ending has a nice twist to it. The book is a fast read with plenty of action and will hold your attention. I really liked the character of Judge Stark, he was smart and tough. He is not afraid to use fist and guns if necessary. He is asked, \\"You going to untangle it with brains or bullets, Your Hornor? His reply, \\" Whatever it takes.\\" A very good western read.	2002-08-18

This is really two stories in one book as there are two different investigations going on at the same time. One is about Stan Gifford, a TV comedian, who dies while on the screen. Was he murdered or did he kill himself? He was thought to be loved by all but it turns out many, many people connected with the show wanted him dead. Through good police work Steve Carella and Myer Myers close in on the killer. Who did the dirty deed? The other story is about Cindy Forrest and a man who shows up at her office, he won't leave and beats up the policeman who is called. She does not know who he is. Bert Kling is assigned to this case. He has had contact with Cindy in a previous book and she does not like him at all. He tries to get of the case but his LT. says no. Bert spends much time with Cindy but after he leaves her one night the man breaks into her apartment and beats her up. Bert then take off on his on investigtation to find the man. Again through very good lab work and Klings police work the man is finally found. A very good police book that explains how things work and how they are but together to come up with the right answers. In most cases you can't go wrong with McBain.	2002-08-15

Three girls have been taken by the Arapaho. Horne is the only one who has a change of getting them back. Horne was once living with the Arapaho so he knows their customs. The Indians who took the girls are led by Red Hawk, who once was a good friend of Hornes. He looks for several months and the book is about his trying to find them. There is a lot of action and the book will hold your attention. I gave it a three because of the beginning. You are told on the first four pages how the book is going to end. I dislike books that do that. I much rather find out at the end of the book instead of the first. Shame on you Jory Sherman.	2002-08-14

Instead he is taken prisoner and put through much punishment and herion shots. Who is the strange girl who keeps bringing Carella food and also giving him the shots? Kling is taken off the case and Myers is given command. They do find tthe killer but is it in time to keep Carella from becoming addicted? This is much better than book nineteen. At least this one involves some police work. I would have given it a five except for several pages of how a doctor treated Tinka Sachs for her drug addiction. I don't think it had anything to do with the case. You knew,in your mind, that Carella had to live to be in the next book but it did hold my attention and I did not want to quit reading.	2002-08-11

Have read several Braun books and for the most part they have all been good. Luke Starbuck is foreman of a ranch owned by Ben Langham. He is hired to go after a gang of men that are stealing horses. He poses as an outlaw to get the job done. Who is the big boss of this gang? Is it Ben Echhardt, Chub Jones, Monty Hall? All are suspected at first but it turns out to be Dutch Henry Horn. Luke uses a quick draw, fist and his natural smarts to get to the bottom of the mess. A fairly quick read, plenty of action and Luke comes to find out he enjoys doing this type of work. I would have given it a five except for the last several pages. I got the feeling Braun was just trying to end the story. It was good, then bam, the ending came very quickly.

He is renamed Hunts-Alone because he cannot hear others and has to hunt by himself. He is left alone with is Granddaughter, South Wind, and raises her by himself. The book is very good. It is about the people of that time and the hardships they faced. I felt sorry for him and the Granddaughter. The story as told makes you see the things that are going on, in your mind. A book that will make you sad and also make you glad in places. If you like books about the early, very early, tribes you will like this.	2002-08-01

I think I gave all the others a five. A body is found with an axe sticking out of the mans head. Who would kill an 86 year old man? Steve Carella and Cotton Hawes are the main ones working on this case. They do the usual of asking questions but turn up nothing. Could it have been the man's son, who has not been out of their house in years, the man's wife, who is crazy as a loon? How about Allie the Shark Spedino, who is brought in for questioning? Then a cop is killed, that makes a big difference in the case. Cotton and Carella cannot turn up anything to solve the mystery, then, and this is why I gave it a four, the murderer is handed to them on a platter. I like the 87th Precinct series very much and will continue to read them, however, wish this could have been solved by them and not handed to them. A quick read, will hold your attention, and if you are into McBain you will like it enough to read it.	2002-07-25

I have read all four and liked them all, some more than others. I think the real hero in this one is really Fay Stillman, Ben's wife. She and several of her friends are being held hostage by a gang of outlaws who plan to kill then all and leave as soon as the snow storm is over. It is the story of their experience with the outlaws and the very quick ending when it all goes down. The back of the book is a little misleading as Ben's wife is not a captive by the time he finds out about what is going on. There is the little play making beween Doc Evans and Katherine Kemmett that might turn into something in the next book. All in all a good western, a quick read and I thing you will enjoy it. Be much better to read them in order. You will get to know the people and hope things turn out alright for all of them.	2002-07-18

There has to be a connection. Sheriff Ben Stillman and his deputy, Leon McMannigle try to figure it all out. It is left up to a woman to make the connection, then Ben knows who the killer is.

As the story unfolds he is really after two different groups, the train robbers and the people he needs to clean out of the town. The story is fast moving, he has to watch out for Norman Bilinsley, biggest rancher around and his hired hands are Ben's biggest headache. What about Bernard McFadden and Iris McFaddeen???????? With much action and the help of Leon McMannigle he manages to do his job. I agree with another reviewer, that is the reason for the three. The sexual content was a little much for me. I know or think I know the book could have been written with much of that left  out. It may help sell books for some people but I buy a western for lot of action with guns and fist, there is that in this book, but the sexual part was a turn off for me.	2002-06-26

His main enemy is Donovan Hobbs and his number one hired gun Weed Cole. Weed????? Through thick and thin Ben tries to work things out. Crystal Johnson, girl friend of Jody Harmon is a good character. Tough as nails, shoots like a man. Leon McMannigle comes into play as a good sidekick to Ben. I hope he is in additional books. A very good western. Lots of action.

I guess because less of Spencer and Susan and the goo-goo eyes between them. Spencer is hired by Mary Lou Buckman to find out who killed her husband. Everybody says it was someone from the Dell, which is a gang of thugs outside of Potshot, Arizona. They are shaking the town down and Mary Lou's husband would not pay them now he is dead. But is all as it appears to be. Did the people from the Dell do the killing or did someone else have a reason to? I liked the thugs Spencer rounded up: Hawk, Vinnie, Tedy Sapp, Bernard J. Fortunat, Chollo and Bobby Horse. All people from previous books. As it said in the book, Spencer hopes his thugs are better than their thugs. Please be sure and notice what it says on page 182 about dogs and heaven. Reminds me of book I read some time ago, I think by William Johnston. A group of mountain men cleaned out a town named Potshot and the leader of the good men in that book was named Preacher. Maybe Parker read it also. All in all a good read, bring back more Spencer and more Hawk and less Susan.	2002-06-22

As far as I know I have read all the books written by Jason Manning. I don't think I have ever read a bad one and this one is no exception. It is a story of two friends growing up. They leave Ill. and go to California. It is about Ethan Payne and his one true love, Lilah Webster. Lilah agrees to wait for him reguardless of how long it takes. It is about his friend Gil Stark. They are friends in the beginning and I guess remain so through out the book even though Ethan stays believing in the law and Gil does anything and every thing he can. Ethan is involved with two other women but his love will always be Lilah. Being on opposite sides of the law, Ethan and Gil face each other more than once but they always remember their early years together. The book is sad in places and I did not like the way it ended but Manning wrote so I felt for the characters in the book. He can write so you feel like you are there. A good western about the good and bad of growing up. I hope there is another one coming out about Ethan Payne and his later years.	2002-06-20

West before, most of which have been very good. Except for the beginning this one is no exception. The first of the book is impossible for me to believe as a 14 year old could not do all the things Mr. West has him doing. If you can get past that it is a prety good book. Jim Lacey is out west with his father. His father is killed and he things it was just a band of Indians but later finds out it was not. Someone else wanted this done. He goes back home to tell his Mother about his Fathers death and while there kills someone. He then heads back west again. It is a good story about his relationship with Buck Ransom and Frank Brown, two mountain men. He spends four years with a tribe of Indians led by Buffalo Shield. His is a story of growing up and how he handles the death of his whole family. Has some good \\"mountain man\\" experiences.

Are the two killings related? Abbie Griffen, wife of Robert is charged with the murder of her husband. Tracy has just been hired by Matthew Reynolds, the best defence attorney there is. Together they set out to prove Abbie is not guilty. But, is she? Has she snowed Matthew Reynolds? You think it is all figured out then, Bang, you are off again with a new twist. It was hard for me to rate, I nearly gave it a three, but is a little better than that, I guess. I got lost during the first several pages because so many names were thrown at me. I also thought the description of some things went into to much detail. Such as what makes up a piece of metal, or how a picture can me made one time and looks like another time. All in all it was fair.	2002-06-05

He was a Ranger and as such is on his way back home after the war. The book will hold your attention. Rusty has to face many disapointments. His girl has gotten married, he has no money and not much hope of getting any. There are people who would like him gone. It is a good story of people at that time and the hard time they faced. Rusty ends up finding a white boy, dressed as an Indian and who had been living with the tribe for several years. This is Bager Boy. As expected the Boy is rejected by what is left of his family and Rusty is to take him back to his own prople. The ending has a surprise. The book is more of a family adventure than a \\"shoot out western\\". It does have a good story. I question the name as the Bager Boy does not relly show up in the book until page 158 when the book is half over, but then I did not name it.	2002-06-02

Joe Trona is a cop, assigned to a jail for his first five years then he will go somewhere else. He is also working for his adoptive father, Will Trona. His father is murdered as Joe is trying to protect him. Joe then sets out to find the killer or killers as the case may be. Joe works within the system using the police force to his advantage. He finds out many secrets and maybe, just maybe, Will was not the saint Joe thought he was. There is some action but the mystery of the book will hold your attention. You won't want to put it down. If you have never tried Parker this is a god place to start.	2002-05-30

This is one of the fair ones. Chis Cole is asked to take an Indian baby to her people. He tries to do so and most of the book is taken up with that journey. He is followed by bounty hunters who are after him. He stops a train from being robbed and fights his way through two different snow storms while carring this baby. If you can believe that. He runs into Jewish people who save his life. All pretty unbelieveable. Some action near the end. All in all, only fair in my openion.	2002-05-27

As I ordered this book I did not know it is really three stores in one book until I received it. As McBain books are, to me, the three are good. The first one is \\"The Empty Hours\\" about a young wealthy woman who is found dead. Who is she and is she who you think she is? Why was she killed? Carella and friends run down clues until they find out. You will be surprised. The second one is simply \\"J\\". A Rabbi is found killed. Who would want to kill a Rabbi? There is a Jew-hater, was it him? Meyer Meyer leds the search to find the killer and finds something out about himself while doing. Again a surprise. The last one is \\"Storm\\". This one features Cotton Hawes and his sweetie going to a ski resort and an instructor ending up dead. Cotton is afraid the local police will mess up the investigation and trys to get involved. The locals resent him being there. He still gets involved and the killer is finally found. As three are three stories in one book they are all pretty short so it make for each one to ba a quick read. McBain will hold your attention and you won't want to put the book down.	2002-05-26

I nearly put the book down after about 80 pages because I thought it was so bad. I kept plugging and it did get better. I still skipped over several pages as I read because they just droned on and on really about nothing. Sean Devin, Jimmy Marcus and Dave Boyle have an experience when they are young that changes their live forever. The book then skips 15 years and starts with them as grown men. Katie Marcus, daughter of Jimmy, is killed. Sean Devine is a state trooper and working on the case. Dave ends up being a suspect. Who did commit the crime? That will be a little surprise, or was to me. But, who pays for the crime? Without saying to much, lots of people pay. A so-so book.	2002-05-25

Have read many books by Jason Manning and I don't remember ever reading a bad one. \\"Mountain Renegade\\" brings back Gordon Hawkes. His wife has died and he is so sad he does not care if he lives or dies. He find out his daughter has gone to Sioux country with her husband, Brand Gunnison, to set up a new fort. He decides to go to her as he knows she will be in danger. There are many scraps with the Indians and Comancheros. There is much action and you wonder if Hawkes will die in this one as you feel like Manning is winding up this series. The Indian maid, Pretty Shield, shows up again. She has loved Hawkes for many years but would not come between him and his wife. A very good read. If you let your self you can feel like you are there. You can see the action in your mind. Manning does a fantastic job. If you like books about the early mountain men and their lives you will enjoy this.	2002-05-21

This is the fourteenth McBain book I have read and I think I have given all of them a five. This envolves the shooting of four people in book store. One of them is Claire Townsend, the girl fiend of Bert Kling, one of the 87th Precinct policemen. The story takes you through the interview of the people who new and were in contact with the four people killed. Why where they killed? Was it just a random thing or was the killer after one of them and didn't care who else he shot? Was he after Claire? All points that way but don't be sure. All the policemen are after the killer because he killed a girlfriend of one of theirs. You can feel the pain and hurt Bert goes through. You can see how hard the others are wanting to catch the killer. A clue is there from the beginning but does not dawn on the searchers until the last. You will be surprised. A book that is short, easy to read and very good.	2002-05-19

I would have given this book a five except for the love makeing between Lou and Lola. I don't buy a western for that. Lou Prophet is a bounty hunter. He is hired to bring Lola Diamond in to testify against Billy Brown. She saw Brown kill a man. Brown runs the town and usually does anythng he wants. He sends several people after Lou and Lola to kill them before they get back to town. Lou is very good at bringing them down as they come but Brown and others finally gang up on them in the end. There is lots of action and the book is very fast moving. If you like a good western and don't mind some sex parts you will like this.	2002-05-17

I relly liked this one until it came to the shoot out on the mesa and then the hunt for the child. It all was so unbelieveable. Reacher is picked up by Carmen Greer, who says he husband, Sloop Greer, beat her, broke bones and abused her. Sloop has been in prison but is getting out in 48 hours. She wants someone to kill him when he gets out. Reacher will not do it but does agree to go to her house to be with her when Sloop comes home. There is much action, many family secrets, several get killed, but through it all Jack Raacher does prevail. The book will hold your attention. Except for several of the parts you can't believe it is pretty good. Lee Child could and has done better.	2002-05-16

This one is no exception. It is about Doug Monahan and the stringing of barbed wire in Texas when it was not popular. He is fought by Andrew Rinehart who has been there a long time and has always done everything like he wanted. It is time for change and Monahan is determined to make it happen. There are the usual fights, and action along the way. I am guessing that things like this actually happen at that time. The book will keep you interested. Monahan does not run when threatened and he will stand on his own. Heis joined by others in his fight.	2002-05-13

Chosen Prey is about James Qatar and his killing several women. He is a teacher and is rather hard to pinpoint. Lucus is back along with his crew, Del, Rose Marie, Sloan, and Marcy. They are looking for the killer but he continues to not be found. In this one I even figured out the ending before we got there. That is unusual for me to be able to do that. Think Sandford may be trying to wind up this series. The book list possibilities of Lucus moving on. I got a little tired of Lucus, Weather and the sex between them. I think the earlier Prey books were better. I still think my favorite is Winter Prey. If you have not read a Lucus Davenport book before please don't judge them all by this one.	2002-05-11

I think this is the first one to be all about Shakespeare McNair and not any on Nate King. King has been the main hero in the other 35. McNair is now in his eighties but you would not know it the way he acts in this book. He and his wife, Blue Water Woman, have seen a monster at their cabin. The monster then carries off Blue Water Woman. Shakespeare of course goes after her. But wait, is the creature that carried off Blue Water a monster or not? Shakespeare and his wife find people in a cave and they  have been there many years. There are also troops from another place after them. Can the mountain man save them? There is a lot of action. The book is easy to read and does not take long. If you liked the books about Nate King you will like this one.	2002-05-09

Ben Crowell and his two friends have many things happen to them that summer, the finding of pearls, the catching of fish, the feeding of hogs, carring water and just growing up. Billy Treat is the one that teaches them much, especially Ben. Trevor Brigginshaw is good as the pearl buyer who has come to town. Judd Kelso is the villian.

This is the thirtenth book I have read by EdMcBain and I think I have given all of them a five. He is a very good writer. This book is about so much. It is about Pepe Miranda, a hoodlum, who is holed up in a apartment and the police are trying to get him out. It is about Zip, a young man who so wants to be the leader of a gang but in the end finds that at least part of his gang is not more. It is about a very good policeman that is no longer with them. It is about a salior on leave and China, the girl he thinks is so pretty. It is about the people of that section and the hard life they live. The whole book takes place in part of one day in the lives of these people. The family of policeman of the 87th Preinct are involved, some good, some not so good. The book will hold your attention. You will feel like you are there and can related to some of these people. A good, short read.	2002-05-04

Sanford wins the fight and thinks he has killed Bauamn. He decides to run. He soon joins forces with Joe Bob Brown, another young man that is as broke as he is.

They round up strayes and take off for Montana. Along the way they fight Commaches, Apaches outlaws and renegade whites. They are both tough and Sanford is good with gun, knife or fist. They each meet young women and hope to have a good life and family in Montana. This is their story. There is enough action to hold your attention but you know both men are fair and square. A very good western. Just remember, if you do read the book, Simon Bauman is lurkng in the background.	2002-05-02

He is hired by Nigel Apperson and Dr. Jane Reeves to guide them to the lost gold of Cortes. BAM, who shows up but Major Miles Perry who has been chasing Clay through the first two books. They declare a truce until the search for the treasure is over. This small group has to fight off Mexican outlaws and Comanches. The journey is long and many things happen along the way.

They are chased by Apachies, Mexican soldiers and Gaston Bachelard and his gang. There is a lot of action and the book will hold your attention. I think you will like Cameron's friends, Jimmy, the kid, Bud Hotchkiss, Tokente and She Bear. Cameron is very tough, good with a gun or knife. He also has his tender side.

Their only clue is the caller states he is a little deaf. Myer Myer is in charge of this investigation. Meanwhile, Steve Carella is in charge of another one involving a dead man.

Caerlla and gang of the the 87th are trying to find out. But, will they do it in time? These books will hold your attention. They go a little deeper into police procedure than many mystery books do. I really enjoy them and I hope you will too. If you read very many you will come to think you know the whole bunch. You will also worry about their wives and children.

His life is saved by a young boy and he goes home with him. There is his mother and his sister with the husband being dead. A villian is trying to take her farm. Clay spends the rest of the book trying to help her and teach the boy how to be a man. The first few pages were good and I gave it a star, the last few pages were good and I gave them a star. That left about 250 pages in the middle was not good for me. It dealt with Clay buidling a barn and teaching the boy how. I nearly put the book down several times but kept thinking it would get better. This book might be great for someone who likes a warm, friendly tale of a family but I don't read westerns for that. If you like a lot of action and something going on all the time, this book is not for you. IT IS SLOW SLOW MOVING!!!! I would advise passing on this one.	2002-04-25

She is bringing money for a surprise and for them to start a new life. This is the story of their trip and return, and what they find and do on the way. For some reason Cole is also called Rainmaker but we are never told why, that I remember. There is a lot of action, most of which is very unbelieveable. Cole is not a super hero as he is not alert enough to stay out of trouble with the outlaws out to get him. As this is McGuire's first book, maybe they will get better. I really hope so.	2002-04-13

She is looking for her husband Dick Cecil. He has not been home it fourteen months. She thinks she knows why but she does not tell her family. The book takes them through their travels, some good and some bad. The pace of the book was very slow but the ending happened very fast. It is almost like MuMurtry wanted to do something else and he just quickly finished the book.

This is ther eleventh of the 87th precinct series I have read and I think I gave all of them a five. Carella and the rest of the precinct are trying to solve the latest mystery. A hand is found, by a policeman on the beat, in an airline bag. Whose had is it and who left it? They start to work on the case and another hand shows up. They appear to have come from the same person. The book as many interesting characters in it. Such as Bubbles, and how is she conntected to the hands? McBain will hold your attention while you enjoy the ride. The books are short, easy to read and very good. You will begin to relate to the whole squad if you can find the books to read in order. A good mystery and hard to put down when you start it.	2002-04-09

I have read all the so called \\"Justice\\" books by Bernhardt but I think I liked this one the best of any of his I have read.Travis Byrne is the new hero. He is an ex-cop with a law degree, but don't let that fool you, he is not good in fights or pulling the trigger. His new clint shoots his way out of the courthouse and takes off. He along with some other people try to make it look like Travis was in on the shoot out. Byrne ends up with many different groups looking for him, the mob, the local police, the FBI and one person acting on his own. He does get some help from two unexpected people. There is lots of action, it is a very fast moving book. I found my self nearly skimming pages to find out what happened next. Has a great ending. Surprising, to me, but great.	2002-04-08

I Think this one is the most unbelieveable of any I have read. It is very hard to discuss the book and not give away the ending. Judy Carrier is trying to get the jury to believe Anthony \\"Pigeon Tony\\" Lucia did not kill Angelo Coluzzi. This is after Pigeon Tony admits he did kill him. Go figure. The Coluzzi family trys to get to Judy and attempts to kill Pigeon Tony. The book will hold you attention, I give it that. It is also very funny in places. The names are great, such a Pigeon Tony, Tony From Down the Block and Tony Two Feet. This is so people won't get the Tonys mixed up. I did not like the flashbacks that Pigeon Tony had, supposed to make you know why he felt like he did but I thought they were way to long. Would like to tell you what I thought was so unbelieveabe but would give away the ending to do that. Part of the book was very good but the flashbacks and the ending was a downer for me.	2002-04-06

The first thirty three pages of this one was great, then about the next hundred pages were so slow and boring in was hard to keep on reading. Frank Farrow and Roman Otis do their bad deeds in the first part of the book. The families and friends left behind bond together and meet once a week. Farrow and Otis decide to come back to town to do another robbery and to kill an ex-cops son. Will they get away with it? Someone is waiting for them with fury in his heart, he is determined to kill them both. But, can he? Take out the middle part of the book and it is a five. Hard not to have a middle part though.	2002-04-02

This is book ten and I am trying to read them in order. The story in nearly all the books take place in a day or two. The books are short and make for a quick read. They are very enjoyable. A boy is kidnapped, but it is the wrong boy. They were supposed to get the son of Douglas King, a very wealth man, but they got the son of his chauffeur instead. King has all his money tied up in buying controling interest in a shoe company and if he pays the ransom he loses the shoe company. The men from the 87th are trying to find who took the boy but if King does not pay they think the boy will be killed. Every thing moves at a very fast pace, will King do what is right and pay up? Will Carella and company find the boy? Makes for a good read.	2002-04-01

I think Mr. Berhardt has done better. I really thought this might be his best one until about the last thirty pages. The ending was so unbelieveable it soured the rest of the book. Ben is his usual soft, kind self. Christina McCall has her degree now and is a partner in the law firm. She does and excellent job in her first case. Ben is defending Keri Dalcaton for the murder of Joe McNaughton, a well like policeman. All the evidence seems to point to her but what about her brother, Kirk Dalcaton? You know he has done somethng really bad. It has the look of a gangland killing so did the mob boss, Tony Catrona, have anything to do with it? Who did kill Joe McNaughton? Jones and Loving are good but Mike is more or less out of the picture on this one. Many twist and turns. Hate the last of the book messed it up for me. Maybe it won't for you.	2002-03-30

The main question is, who killed Grantley Smith and why? Our good Constable Evans is hot on the trail. They are several people who would have liked him dead and one of them committed the deed. Evan has to be involved with the raising of a World War II plane, keeping the peace, thinking about stored paintings during the war and his beloved Bronwen. Bowen writes so you can feel like you are there. You really feel like you are part of the Welsh village of Llanfair. If you like a good gentle mystery with lots of Welsh people being described and am sure beautiful county side, you will like this book.	2002-03-28

I think only Ed McBain could take only one day and write a whole book that would hold my attention. Steve Carella's sister is getting married and maybe, just maybe someone is trying to kill the groom. Who and why? It could be one of several people but Steve and his buddies from the 87th are running out of time to find the killer. Bert Kling and Cotton Hawes are off duty but agree to come to the wedding to help. Myer Myer and the ones on duty are working on another angle. Also, Teddy, Steve's wife is expecting a baby any time. Does she have it in this book or maybe the next one, have to read to find out. You will not want to put this one down when you start it. A quick easy to read good book.	2002-03-24

This one is as much about Terry McCaleb as Harry Bosch. Terry is asked to come help find the killer of Eddie Gunn. Even though Terry is supposed to be retired he agrees to help. Guess who all the evidence points to? Yes, Harry Bosch, did Harry really kill Gunn? To prove he did not, Harry only has a few days to find the true killer. The book will hold your attention. You will not want to put it down until the end. I could gladly slap the face of Jack McEvoy, the reporter, but Connely can write so you feel that way about a character. If you like a good mystery you will enjoy this one.	2002-03-24

Have read these in order and thought this one was a little slow in places. Thought it would just drag through many pages. Stephene is her usual self, trying to do her job. Of course, Mike, Lulu, Ranger and company make for good stuff. The question starts with where is Uncle Fred? He has disappeared and nobody knows what happened to him and no one really seems to care. Pictures are found with body parts in them, could Fred be part of this? There are the comic sections with Grandma and her funeral home visits and the elderly people in Stephenes apartment who are packing, guns that is. Cars get stolen, bombed and general mayhem. All in all a pretty good read.	2002-03-20

I think I have liked all the Ralph Cotton books I have read and this one is no exception. I really like the character of Ranger, Sam Burrack. This one is about his earlier years as he learns the ways to deal with and handle people. Burrack is after the Ganston Gang, but there is a problem. A young boy by the name of Billy Odle is with them. Was he taken or did he go on his own? His life reminds me of so many kids his age today. Can Sam find him, rescue him and turn his life around at the same time? What about Willie John? Does he end up good or bad? Cotton can make you see in you mind just like you were there. A very good Western with a lot of heart. I think you will enjoy it.	2002-03-18

I really liked the first ones much better. Silent Justice really has two stories at the same time. Ben has a class action suit against a big company for dumping chemicals into drinking water and therefore killing children. Meanwhile, his friend, Mike Morell is after a person who is killing people for no apparent reason. What is the killer looking for? What is the merchandise? I nearly went to sleep reading page after page of much to complicated words for my small brain understand during the trial. I really like Ben, Christina McCall, Jones, Loving and Mike. Maybe its time for me to change instead of thinking Bernhardt will go back to writing like he did earlier. It is sort of a surprise ending but I thought I would read forever to get to that part. Sorry, but the writer has done better.	2002-03-16

Benjamin Martin and his family are the main characters but many, many people in it are heros. It really made me think about what all so many people have gone through so I can live free. I learned to hate, if that is a good word to use, Travington's Dragoons and the action he and his men took. The book is sad in many places, has a lot of action and will hold your attention. Molstad writes so you can feel like you are there and sharing the hard times with the people in the book. It is very fast moving and enjoyable.	2002-03-13

I have read several Margolin books and I think I have rated about all of them a three. I don't know why I keep on trying when I read others that I rate higher. I nearly lost this one during the first twenty or so pages, I kept getting so many people thrown at me I was confused as to who was who. I think most can figure out who the real killer is way before the book is over, I know it is easy to figure out who it is not. Amanda Jaffe may be a good lawyer but she needs some help in the common sense department. I felt sorry for Bobby Vasquez, he really wanted to catch the true killer and tried his best. Our laws today, in many cases, help the killer more than the police who are trying to do their job. The making of a new hand was a joke, can't buy that one. I ask my question again, why do I buy these???	2002-03-11

I don't know any one but McBain that could hold my attention in a book that last for only a one day period of time. He is so good. The 87th Precinct gets a note one morning saying The Lady will be killed that night at 8:00. What lady???? Who could the killer be and why? There are millions of people in the City, is it possible to find The Lady and the killer before the deadline? The usual bunch try their best, Bert Kling, Steve Carella, Cotton Hawes, Myer Myer and Hal Willis give it all they have. It is a very good book on the way good police procedure will win out. The book will hold your attention, you can feel like you are part of the action going on, you can see in your mind the sweat and concern as the dead line draws closer. It is not about blood, guts and gore but will be a very good fast mystery read for you. I am trying to read these in order, hard to find some of them but think it is worth the try.	2002-03-09

I don't remember rateing any of them this low before. Ben, as usual takes a case to help a cause instead of for money. I think this is very good of him but page after page is used to push the \\"save the trees\\" people on you. I agree the trees should not be cut but I did not buy this type book to hear about it. Ben and Christina McCall are there usual smart selves. Ben is paired against \\"Granny\\" Adams when the case goes to trial. I think Loving is losing it as a tough guy. He is getting beat up to much. The part with thefireat the cabin is so unbelieveabe it is unreal, come on, this can't happen. Mike and Jones are more or less left out of this one. It seems like a lot of the sam thought was written in a previous book, the DA, the Judge, the fire, the helicopter, all sound like something I read in one of his others. Would suggest reading them in order and maybe skipping this one.	2002-03-05

I have read all of the Alex Cross books except the last one. I thought thery were the very best but \\"1st To Die\\" is as good as any of them. I guess it is all a personal openion as I have read some of the other reviews and many are not so good. In this one there are four women, with much knowledge, who meet and try to find the killer. Lindsay Boxer, an inspector--Claire Washburn, a medical examiner--Jill Bernhardt, an assistant D.A. and Cindy Thomas, a reporter. Newlyweds are being killed very soon after their weddings. Lindsay also has a medical problem of her own which could result in her death. Three couples are killed. What is their connection? Won't go into detail but every time I thought I had it figured out there was another twist and BAM I did not. This book will hold your attention, it will make you feel like you are there. I triedto read as fast as I could to see who the real kiler was. Suprise after surprise. I like the short chapters as I have to put a book down so many times while reading it. If you like one that will twist and turn on you and keep you guessing, you will like this book.	2002-03-03

I have read these book in order and I think I gave the first three a five rating. \\"Four\\" has all the great characters of the first three plus two newcomers. Namely, Sally Sweet and Sugar. I hope Sally Sweet is back again. He added a great deal of humor to the book. This is a very good mystery that will hold your attention until the last for the surprise ending. These books are fun to read and you will find your self laughing out loud in many places. I really like Stephanie, Joe, Lula and Ranger. Also, Grandma is always good for a laugh. Why did I give it a three??? Because of the sex part in this one. I know this is just me, but, the first three played about with sex with thoughts and a few words. This book got very descriptive with it which I did not like. To each his or her own and it won't matter to Evanovich at all but just my openion.	2002-03-02

She wants to kill him for arresting her husband, who then died in prison. She has a gun and a bottle of nitro or is it nitro???? She is mean, mad and means what she says. Meanwhile Carella is out investigating a suicide. Or is it a suicide? Was it murder??? He does not know anything is going on. Different officers try things to get the gun away from Dodge, and some pay for it. This is a quick read. It will hold you attention. You will not want to put it down.

Then, an old girlfriend of Earl Bonners turns up dead and Earl is the chief suspect. Earl is a friend of Ben's and the owner of the club where Ben plays. Kincaid decides he has to defend him and will take one more case. He again gets the help of Christina McCall, Jones and Loving. There is another killing and as they get closer to the killer he comes after Ben. Mike Morelli, a friend and policeman, trys to help but he is unable to. Can Ben pull it off without getting killed himself???? A very, very good ending. I thought I had it figured out and BAM I did not. Strange things happen during the last pages. I found myself trying to read faster and faster to see what was happening and how it would end. If you like a good mystery with a strange twist I think you will like this.	2002-02-26

Joe Morelli is a very good cop and really cares for Stehpanie. Ranger may be my new hero. He is hard, tough and a great bounty hunter. They all work together to find Uncle Mo and why so many bodies are being found. A great funny mystery, not blood and guts gory but very entertaining.

I really liked the characters, the play between them and all the action. I did not like all the sex, the directions given when someone was going somewhere or several pages of just talk. The take down of Sherman Coles was great. Ray and Earl Boone were very well described as the slum bums they were. Strange and Quinn worked good together as a team. Pelecanos wites so you can feel like you are there, you can see the people and their actions in your mind. I guess I liked it more than I disliked it but it was close. I did not need to know that if I walked down this street I would come out in the alley and go up to a swinging bridge and across a hill and back around to some building. If you lived in DC this might have been good but not to a country boy.	2002-02-19

Two different rangers are found dead, everyone but Anna thinks they were accidents. She goes about proving they were murder. In doing so an attempt is made on her life. But, why were the rangers killed? What is going on???  I think the action is a little slow, maybe to much talk and thought. I don't really know but it just never grabed me the way others have.

Also, I do not like flashbacks but am sure a lot of people do. Wil is someone I can relate to. He is not superman, he does make mistakes, he does get hurt. There are really two things Hardesty is trying to find out. Is Denny Van Zant still alive and who killed Carmen Marquez. Are they tied together??? Trina Van Zant, name is different after three marriages, leds Wil a merry chase. It all does finally get drawn to a close but I have read better by Barre.	2002-02-17

I think I have rated all the others with five stars. This is the first one I was disappointd in. To me, the trial pages were way to long. He went into to much detail on blood and DNA testing. If I had wanted a medical book I would have read one. All the people I liked were there, Ben, Christina, Jones, Loving and Mike. The first of the book was good and the ending was a surprise, to me at least. The middle was boring and to wordy at times. The ending left me sad and this had not happened in the previous books.

Meyer Meyer, yes, that is his name, Bert Kling, Steve Carella and newcomer Cotton Hawes are after who ever killed a young lady at a liquor store and also who ever killed a cop.

I really wish the world had a lot of Ben Kincaids in it, but I doubt it does. Ben is defending an retarted man who is accused of killing a woman ten years ago. The story also includes another man who is taking young boys and making them do sexual things before he kills them. How do these two things connect?? Have to read to find out but you will. Ben, Mike Morelli, Christina McCall, Jones and Loving are all involved. The story will hold your attention from beginning to end. The court room drama is very good. Morelli is, as usual, a very good detective. The ending will surprise you, or it did me, anyway. Ben even gets closer to his Mother in this one. This is book five, would suggest reading them in order, if possible, they will make a better connection.	2002-02-01

So much was really unbelieveable. Clayton or what ever his code name is at the present time, is a superman, cannot be killed no matter what. Just an all around bad book for me. I did read it all thinking it had to get better, but it did not. Read something you know you like or some of the Lou Boldt books and leave this one alone.	2002-01-29

They all have been good and each one I read I think is better than the last one. Ben has agreed to defend a member of a white supremacy group for the murder of a Vietnamese young man. Did the man commit the crime?? He won't say he did or he didn't. Ben uses all his knowledge and people to try to prove him innocent. The whole crew is here, Ben, Christina McCall, Mike Morelli, Jones and Loving. When someone asked if Jones and Loving had a last or first name, Ben's reply was, No, they came that way. The book will hold your attention from beginning to end. Ben gets beat up and then nearly killed. The ending will really suprise you, at least it did me. The courtroom scenes are great. I think you will really like this book.	2002-01-23

I think it may be the best one yet, even though I enjoyed the first two. The back cover is very misleading. Ben finds a dead body, or was it, before his first case is decided and he is never charged with murder. Ben has joined at big law firm and left his private practice. Ben was in a big firm before and left it in one of the other books. He joins this one for the money. The firm is true of many today with the suck ups and people brown noseing all the time. A fellow Attorney does turn up dead, also &quot;ladies of the evening&quot; are being found dead. Could the two be connected??? Ben works with his friend and ex-brother in law, Mike Morelli to find the killer. He uses all his people from his private practice to help him, Christina McCall, Jones and Loving. Will he stay at the new firm or go back to private practice? Will they find the killer before he strikes again? A good read. I found myself just scanning pages at the end so I could find out how it ended. A surprise or two at the end. Hard to put the book down. Am looking forward to the next one.	2002-01-16

Steve Carella is investigating the murders of young women who are floating to shore. Can Steve catch him before he strikes again???? There are several different cons going on at the same time. The others involve money and not murders. A tattoo artist gets in the middle along with Mrs. Carella. A good, short read that will make you want to read very fast. I nearly just scanned thelast twenty or so pages because I wanted to find out what the ending was. I think you will enjoy this very much.	2002-01-14

You won't be able to put the book down is the reason it will gather no dust. I really enjoyed this one. I have read them all up to now and am looking forward to the next one. Hamish is quite a character. He is trying to find out who killed the dustman and another murder takes place. Did the same person do both??? Hamish wades through the various people of his village asking questions and putting his thoughts together. He has a new assistant in this one but will he keep him and is the assistant someone who could have committed the murders? His true love Priscilla is around and pretty as ever. Of course Inspector Blair is always causing trouble for Hamish. A good book, you can feel like you are there. You can see the village in your mind and if you are like me, wish it were possible to live in a place like this.	2002-01-11

Have just started reading this series and have a long way to go, but I am really looking forward to it if they are all like this one. Steve Carella and Bert Kling are back. They make a great team. They are trying to find who killed a young man, then others are killed to cover up the first killing. I don't want to name names as would take away from the book. The ending is good. McBain can make you feel like you are there. You can nearly feel the the thoughts and actions as they take place. A fairly short book that is quick to read. A very good mystery.	2002-01-08

He is doing this in his off duty time. Then a young girl Kling has met is killed, was it by the mugger or not????? The ending is great is all I will say about that.

I really liked The Innocents so I bought the rest of the Wil Hardesty series. Boy, do I wish I had not. If you do decide to read Bearing Secrets be sure to have a pen and paper in hand and write down each character and how they relate to the book. You will need this as it is very confusing. I don't think I have ever read a book that I stayed so lost with the people in it. It goes back seventeen years and brings you up to date. There are just so MANY PEOPLE and groups involved. I ended up reading several pages twice to try to connect who was who. I guess I will read the next one as I already have it and hope it is like the first one and not the second.	2002-01-03

They all have had some parts that are really unbelieveable but so much of this one is it is unreal. Reacher is blackmailed into helping the FBI track down a seriel killer. Why is the killer taking out single women? The connection seems to be they were all military and filed charges of sexual harrasement charges against a higher authority. But is that the reason? We have Julia Lamarr and Nelson Blake, bad FBI agents and Lisa Harper, good FBI agent. I really think a lot of the actions by the FBI is really what is happening in the world today. Women keep getting killed in bathtubs covered in paint. How did they die? No one can figure out. Jack must be slipping, the FBI has followed him for a week and he is not aware of it. The crimes take place to far apart and it takes forever for Jack to explain to Lisa how he knew who the killer was. I agree with other reviewers that Jack needs to clean up more often. I guess I will read more about Jack Reacher but hope the next one is more believeable.	2001-12-30

It was very good. Stephanie Plum is fired from her job and has no money. She hooks up with her cousin Vennie to be a bounty hunter. About like me trying to fly a plane. Very good fun to see her in action. She wants to find Joe Morelli, who she has know since high school. Joe is accussed of murder and has skipped his court hearing. Joe is an ex cop and may or may not be guilty. Along the way she comes in contact with Biento Raminez, a great boxer, who treats women like dirt and I would like to do him in myself. Stephanie does her job through many mishaps, and comicial situations. I like the characters of her family. I really liked Grandma Mazur. I think you will find the ending a surprise but good. The book will hold you attention. I keep thinking of &quot;Laverne and Shirley&quot; even though there were in a different town. Will try to read the rest in order.	2001-12-25

It is about the slaughter of the buffalo by hide hunters. Kelton writres so you feel like you are there. You can just see the country, the plains, mountains and valleys, the buffalo running. It is all so clear. This is about how people lived at that time. It is about Cephus Browder and his daughter Arletta, who does a man's job but has the feelings of a woman. Colonel Damon Gregar and his sorry son Farrell Gregar. There are times I would liked to have shot Farrell myself. Jeff Layne, who I guess is the hero. But he is a humble one. Sully, who is a hero in my openion. Nigel Smithwick, know as English to one and all. How he becomes one of the people of the west. An last but not least Crow Feather and his fellow Indians. How they were badly mistreated and the life they had. A good read. The last few pages will cause chills to go up your back, or at least it did mine. If you like westerns with out a lot of bang, bang heros or ugly words you will like this book.	2001-12-22

Maybe because I have become more familiar with the characters in the Boldt group. Hard Fall will hold your attention, expecially the last half of the book. The sex parts were a little to graphic for me but to each his on. I feel for Cam Daggett and his son Duncan. It made me sad to read about them but that means the author is doing his job. Cam is good and you pull for him to find the bomber before he strikes again. Cam is lucky to have two women after him. I guess that is luck as it is hard to make one happy. Pearson will have you feeling like you are there and going through the feelings with the characters. All in all pretty good--the new man Bradley Levin was good also.	2001-12-17

I really liked the first two books in this series. I think I gave one a five start rateingand the other a four. But, this one is so bad. Nathan Blaylock, Jim Riley and Doc Hennison are together again but the action is scarse. There is page after page of thought and talk. Memories of Wyatt's earlier days, all severalages of more thought. The last 12 pages of the book are good, the rest is a waste. I know Parry can do better than this as the first two were so good.

Benjamin Gage is running against Ellen Crease for Senator, did he hire someone to kill Hoyt and Crease or to kill Hoyt and cause Crease to take the blame? Judge Richard does a no-no with Andrea Chapman or is she Andrea Chapman? The book takes many twist and turns as the police try to find the killer. It will hold your attention. Some of the trial apperances drag on a little long. But wait, the ending will surprise you, it did me, but then I am not as swift on the pick up as some of the other reviewers. I have read several Margolin book and I like this one and &quot;The Burning Man&quot; better than any of the others, so far. If you want a book that will hold your attention, with lots of twists and a surprise ending, I think you will like this.	2001-12-11

In this one Nathan Blaylock and his friend, Jim Riley are trying to find Nathan's son. Nathan has left him behind in the first book. They are still in the north land. Some of this is a little unbelieveable. This is supposed to envolve around the President of the US, Marta Kelly and Natan. Marta is looking to buy weapons to help her country of Panama. How do they finally meet? Nathan is about 30 miles from Dawson and he drives his dog sled within sight of Marta. Right in the middle of nowhere. Really now!!!!!!!! Nathan does pick up a couple of new friends in this one. Many Hat and Sweetness. You will be surprised who they are. He sill has his old friend Jim, whom I like and Doc Hennison, he is nearly hung and I which they would. I get a belly full of Doc pretty quick. Does Nathan find his son? Do the weapons get bought? Do Marta and Nathan make a couple? Have to read to find out but makes a pretty good story. Ending was a little sad. If you plan to read this one please read The Winter Wolf first.	2001-12-09

It started a little slow and the main character, Peter Hale, made mistakes a lawyer should not make reguardless the field of law he is in. Hale has been sent to Oregon because he has messed up where he is. He is caught up in the middle of a murder case involving a mentally retarded man. Did the man murder the woman? All things point to him doing in at first. But there are many differnet things involved. As Assistant DA who will stop at nothing, legal or not. A brother-in-law, who is also an attorney, that just does not seem right about the case. If the retarted man is convicted can Peter safe him before he is sentenced? Who really is the killer? You will be surprised, at least I was. A book I did not want to put down. I wanted to read faster and faster to see if Gary, the retarted man, would be saved. I could not believe he would be convicted. I thought if I read faster the crime would be solved faster, I guess. Was there an undercover cop? If so which one. If you like legal mysteries you will like this one.	2001-12-08

This book is how Nathan, Jim Riley and friends try to find Wyatt. The chase leads them through San Francisco, up to Alaska. There are many adventures and gun fights along the way. Do they find Wyatt in the end, do they kill him???? Have to read to find out. A well written book that gets you involved with the characters. You are sad when something happens to some of them.

Jack Reacher is again the hero. He is trying to find out what happend to Victor Hobie. Did he did die in Vietnam or not? If he did who is making all the bad things happen? Parts of the book were great and parts were very, very slow moving. In one place it took two pages to tell out Hobie went to bed. There were pages of airline travel to many different places. Most all the book is about the Stone family, Chester and Mayilyn but in the end nothing is said about what happened to them. They just are not there any more. Shame, shame Mr. Child. I found myself scanning several pages because they were just talk or thinking which did not amount to anything. I hope the next book is as good as the first two.	2001-12-04

He sets out to make the ranch prosper once again. The rest of the book is their story with the villian being Cal Nutt, a carpetbagger.  Nutt trys everything he can to get the Olivers to leave the country. Can he make them go? With the four brothers, at least part of the four, fighting back, will they stay. Who gets killed?? I think the first part of the book and the last part were good. So much of the middle was page after page of somebodys thought. I thought I was reading a history book.

I thing some of the chase plus some pages of explaining things could have be shorter. I really like Lou Boldt. Maybe he is slowing down and so am I, I guess that is why I can relate to him. People are being robbed and police people are being hurt and even killed. Who is doing this? Is it a real crook or is it some other policeman who is out with the Blue Flu? (...) I like the characters of Bobbie Gaynes, Daphne Matthews and John LaMoia.  I  also liked Mama Lu, which was in a previous book. There is a lot of action and suspence. I also like Liz Boldt, I think she adds a degree of calm to Lou and she is a very strong forgiving person. A book that may be a little long but is still pretty good if you like mysteries.	2001-11-30

It is really a story about the hate between two men. Thomas Canfield and Branch Isom. Canfield is called The Hawk on the back cover but I never did understand why or where that came into play. Canfield owns lots of land and cattle, Isom owns most of the business in town. They fight all the time. It is about their lives and the people around them. The ending will surprise you, it is very good. Kelton writes so you can feel like you are there. It is a book taht could have really happened.

The author has already made his by that time. I think Hearstone has to many characters and to many different stories going on at the same time. I was totally confused. The story is about who killed Richie Walters and Elaine Murray. Wasit the Collidge brothers, Bobby and Billy or not? Was the key witness told what to say? What about the prisoners who said they knew something. Of course the detective will do what ever to solve the case. The DA is looking out for him self and his future even if he holds back the truth. The last few pages of the trail were very good. The rest was not.

It is  about a man who is over 700 years old and cannot be killed. He can turn from a man into a wolf and back into a man again when ever he wants. Many, many people are sent to find him, to many people to keep up with--very confusing. The main thrust of the book is the screw up of the federal government in the way the affair is handled. This may happen quite a bit but I don't need Johnstone to tell be about it in a book that is supposed to be about something else. I quite reading the Mountain Man series and The Last Gunfighter Series because each book was about half filled with what had happened in a previous book. Think I will quit reading Johnston all together. He will never know it and will continue to publish many, many books and make mucho dinero. I would not advise anyone to buy any of the Johnstone books except the early Mountain Man books or the Preacher books. They were so good.	2001-11-24

I really like Crais as a writer, I like Elvis Cole and Joe Pike. However, I hate that Elvis has and is involved with Lucy Chenier. In my openion it takes away from the books. It was the same in Voodoo River and now this one. In fact this book was nearly half over before I thought it got down to the business at hand. Cole is hired by a high priced Attorney to find out if Angela Rossi, a detective, planted evidence against his client. Cole not only finds out but proves who did the killing and who actually did fool with the evidence. I liked the character of Angela Rossi and Ray Depente was brought back for a few pages. I hope both of these are in future books but Cole and Lucy  together, I can do without. Cole and Pike are compared to Spence and Hawk and I agree but I don't think Hawk would have missed getting the shooter behind the car.	2001-11-23

Terry is a trained killer, guns, knives, hands, you name it and he can kill with it. This is his life as he goes to many different countries doing his job. It is a sad book to me as he is lost for ever from his family, he becomes to hard for them. He is for ever lonely and by him self. I feel like to much of the book was written about his many, many affairs with women everywhere. Very detail and several pages devoted to that. In fact I guess over half the book was about his lust life. Would have liked it better if more written about the fighting.	2001-11-21

About half the forty pages were flashbacks of previous books.  I used to love his Mountain Man Series but I quit reading them because he would spent a big part of the book with pages of what happened in a previous book. Now I will quit reading the Last Gunfighter series. I guess you make as much money doing this and you don't have to think up as many new things to write, just repeat what you have already written. In my openion it is bad for an author with this ability to take advantage of people that do not know these thing until they buy the book. It should be noted on the cover of this and other books he has done: BEWARE--ABOUT HALF OF WHAT YOU  READ IS IN A PREVIOUS BOOK!!!!	2001-11-20

Elvis is in Cajun country, Crais is at home. But, I was not pleased with a lot of pages of talk, talk and more talk with Lucy. Elvis does his job, see review, but thought a lot of the book just drug. The ending was good but only lasted a few pages. Would also like a lot more of Pike. He is so good. Can do without Lucy in future books but I gather she is going to be in them. If you have not read a Crais book before do not start with this one. Any of the first four are better, I think.	2001-11-18

Vets are being mailed stock certificates in major companies. Hudson has a plan to bring the American way of life to an end. They appear to know everything ahead of time, so there has to be an insider. Besides Hudson the other man bad guy is Francois Monserrat or is that his real name????????  Who is he????????  I like the Alex Cross books much better. So much talk, talk, talk on many pages that I found myself just skimming them to get to the next good place. Parts made no sense to me.

Tom Shephard has come back home to be the lead detective in Laguna Beach. People keep getting killed and no one knows why. Tom figures out what the person looks like but still no why. The mystery goes back to events of many years ago. He keeps digging and comes up with the answers. The ending is very surprising. Can't say much more without giving away who the killer is. I think you will like this book if you like a fast moving book that will hold your attention and keep you guessing. Even though it is good I liked Blue Hour and Red Light better.	2001-11-15

I like Trackdown better than the last book but I don't think it is as good as many of the early ones. The early ones may be like the mountain man himself, they may be a thing of the past. Nate King is trying to trackdown his wife and daughter, Winona and Evelyn, who have been kidnapped by the Sa-gah-lee.  They are a very primitate tribe. You will never guess why they wanted Winona and Evelyn. UGH!!!!  King tracks for several days, overcomes many dangers and finally finds them but then he is captured by the Sa-gah-lee. Will they escape and if they do will they be eaten by the cannibal tribe of Dabi-mussa?? Have to read to find out. Thompson writes so it holds your attention, the books are fairly short and reads quickly. I can see the things happen in my mind as they do on paper. If you like stories about mountain men read this one and the earlier ones he wrote.	2001-11-13

As it says on page 221, &quot;it is a complex operation, involving ships, the containers, the cargo, the rendezvous, transporation, fake ID's, graveyards, brothels and sweatshops.&quot; The TV news gets in the act in the form of Stevie McNeal. Her adopted sister, Melissa, disappers. Some high ranking agent has to be on the take for it to work. Boldt and his group work their selves to death and everytime they get close some dummy from a TV news team messes it up for them. Never did know what happened to Coughlie or who he worked for. I really liked the character of Mama Lu. Hope she is used again. Pearson writes a fast paced book but I thought the several pages it took for McNeal to get on board the ship took way to long. The book is good, but some things you don't find out are not so good.	2001-11-12

Patterson's imagination is wonderful.The book starts great, it grabs you by the throat and never lets go. A series of crimes with bank employees and their families getting killed for no apparent reason. Cross and Sampson take off to try and find the so called Mastermind, who is behind it all. I like the short chapters as I have to quit quite often and it makes it easier. The three rating was because of the ending. I am pretty sure I would have bought his next book but I hate to feel forced into it. If I read 378 pages, paperback, I think I should be through. Shame on you James Patterson for an ending like that. I guess it is one way to string everybody along and sell another book, however, you are a great writer, you did not need to do this.	2001-11-10

Dave is his usual, hard as nails, self. Sometimes I would like to slap his buddy Clete myself. He stays in trouble of his own making. Yes, I think I would have pulled the trigger on Will Buchalter. The things he does to Dave and his family will make you want to do the same. Burke is great with his use of the language and description of the country. He makes you feel like you are there. Lots of good characters in this one. Good mystery and lots of action. Can Robicheaux save Clete, what does the German sub have that several people want? A good read.	2001-11-08

I think Die Trying is the better of the two. Jack Reacher is thrown in the back of a panel truck with woman he does not know and by three men he does not know. The woman is being kidnapped and Reacher is along for the ride, and what a ride. From Chicago to wherever it is rough. The story is scary as it could very well be true. If you like a fast paced book with lots of action you will like this. The army and the FBI play politics and that I do not like. Reacher is very good in the mountains. I think you will enjoy reading about the rifle firing at 1000 yards, what a surprise. How did Reacher miss??????? Holly Johnson was something else too. Even with a hurt knee she could take on two or more. Just to much to talk about it all---have to read it.	2001-11-05

If I had wanted a joke book I would have bought one. I nealy quit on the first page because of the language and I wish I had. There is really no story, nothing that relates to what a good western is all about. If you want to read a western do not read this one.	2001-11-03

Lou Boldt and company also have to fight the Feds. all the way. Politics is played between many people. The people and the way it plays out, on page 283, paperback, will nearly make you cry. What a warm feeling. From page 428 on I was realy caught up in the action. I could not read fast enough. If you want a good mystery, with lots of action and many good characters you will like this book.	2001-11-03

I like the Kidd and LuEllen books because of the mystery, action and suspense but I cannot understand the high-tech and computor stuff--way over my head, so I loose a big part of the books.

Most have been pretty good. I was disapointed in this one. It was not as much about mountain men and indians as most of the others. It was more about rideing for several days and then fighting prehistoric animals, birds, fish and men. If I wanted a book about prehistoric beings I would have bought one. David Thompson please go back to writing about the lives and times of the mountain men and the indians. Bring back Shakesphere McNair. Please do what you do best.

They are an elite five that have made a boo boo. Elvis and Pike find out why and how and then go to work.  In the mean time all in LAPD is looking for them. Action is fast and often. Crais does a good job of pulling it all together. I really liked the character of Ray Depente, he was great. Maybe could be used again somewhere. Don't remember reading what happened to the fifth policeman???? If you like a fast read, lots of action and Pike to admire, you will like this. Pike did mess up one time though, don't remember him doing that before. Wonder who is best, Pike or Hawk???	2001-10-28

I really like the characters. Carella and Teddy are very good. You could almost feel like you were there. Just everyday folks, some doing good and some doing bad. No big macho thing just like what would happen anywhere in any town. If you like a good mystery, a quick read and good characters you will like this book.

I really liked the character, John Caine. An ex-navy seal and about as tough as they come. The book as a fairly good story line and the dirty videos that are mentioned would make a good mystery story. I was turned off by the unbleiveable part about John being dumped in shark infested waters and swimming 10 miles to shore and lived to tell about it. Then later in the book there is a fantastic storm and these two small sail boats continue to hold up and get them close enough to fight and then leave. I don't think so. May read another one but will try to find one used, don't think I want to pay the price of another new one if it is as unbelieveable.	2001-10-26

I like Lou Boldt and Daphne Matthews. If Boldt does become a Lieutenant I don't think it will be as good. The character of Ben was very good. Would like to see him again as he grows up. Lets you use your imagination, you can just see the things as they happen. My reason for a three was the length of the book. Paper back--644 pages. I nearly put it down several times because I was past ready for it to be over. A lot of thought and feeling could have been left out. In my humble openion around 400 to 425 pages is plenty. If you like a good mystery that is very looooonnnnnng. You will like this.	2001-10-17

No, it is not scary, no it does not use a lot of ugly, ugly words, no it will not keep you up at night from being scared. It is a really good mystery that will hold your attention and make you want to skip pages to find out how it will end. Ben is a good attorney that has people on his mind and not money. Christina is a good character. I liked her and Jones and Loving. I really hope these four form a group, &quot;family&quot; if you please, that will be in book three.

I agree it was good enough to try another one but not great. Cannot believe Ben was so bad in court. After all he had been in DA's office, what did he do there. Sounds like he can solve a mystery better than try one. Hope his character and that of Christina McCall get better as time goes on. Glad he left the big deal law firm. Reminds me of a lot of Attorneys and business people in general----the dollar is the only thing that matters. A fair mystery, a fair attorney. Glad I started with this one.	2001-10-01

I did not like the beginning. I was totally confused for the first several pages. Where were about five different stores going at one time. Finally, they got all tied together. On pages 208 and 209, paperback, it was crazy over the description of a car. No one could follow that bunch of numbers. I really liked the book except for those two things. I did not want to put it down after it really got started. It will keep you reading fast in order to see what is going to happen. David Nash is great as a defense attorney. His morals leave a lot to be desired, but he is a good attorney until he meets his match in Tom Gault. If you like legal thrillers you must read this.	2001-09-29

It was good enough that I will get another one but it was not great. Jack Reacher is picked up by the police department for murder. He has only been in town a short while and has committed no crime. The story goes from there to finding cops on the take as well as others in the town. I kept thinking Reacher would change into a Superman costume. He can take out as many men as they send and no harm to him. Parts of the book was very unbelieveable. However, part of it could really hold your attention. There was to much detail about the printing of the money, in my openion. All in all a fair read.

I really liked the first five I read and will continue to read them as I don't think any more will be like this. This one had such catching names as Baby Feet Balboni and Twinky Herbert Lemoyne. This a fast moving book. I liked Dave's partner, Rosa Gomez, a stand up FBI agent. What I did not like was all the talk to the Confederate Dead. Come on. I know this is fiction and some is hard to believe, but this. Also, a friend who gets killed comes to Dave in a dream and tells him what to do.

Elvis finds them but they now have mob connections and the mob does not want to give the wife up. Elvis and Joe then take on the mob. Coles fast mind and quick wit get him into and out of trouble. Pike is always around someehere. You may not see him but he is there. A very good mystery and Crais holds you attention. I found myself nearly skipping pages to find out what happened next.

A place was left for it when all the other bands got together. I am glad to finally get a story about what happened to it. Don Coldsmith writes good books about \\"The People\\". A fictional account but is based losely on events of long ago. The lost band was nearly wiped out by Shaved-heads. This is the story of the few that were left and how they taught the customs, language and other aspects of \\"The People\\" to their children and on down for several generations. Many thought they would be the one to get back and find the original group but it was not to be until a special child was born to lead a small band back to their special place. A good quick read that is enjoyable if you like stories of people of long ago and how they lived and died. It will hold you attention and you will hope someone finally leads the lost band back.	2001-09-16

I liked it better than &quot;The Monkey's Raincoat.&quot; Elvis is hired by Bradley Warren to find a book that has been stolen. As he begins his search, Mimi Warren, his daughter, is kidnapped. Or, is she. Elvis and Pike get involved with Japanese bad men. Can the book be found, can they bring the daughter back alive? Makes for a pretty good book. Hate to say so but is a little like a Parker book where Spencer would not take a young man back to his parents because he did not want to go. Elvis is a wisecracking PI, a whole lot like Spencer. However, I do believe Hawk can take Pike. All in all if you like a good mystery that is fast moving and as some surprising twists, I think you will like this book.	2001-09-08

One was about Samuel Pietro and the people who kidnapped him and the other was the main story of Amanda McCready and the people who kidnapped her. There are many twist and turns. I thought I had it all figured out, them wham, we went off in another direction. I was really liking Poole and Broussard at first, then they ending up being pond scum. Amanda is kidnapped, a ransom demanding stolen money is received. Drug dealers are killed, the stolen money is stolen again, one of the drug dealers may have been an undercover agent, the girl is still missing. I did not like the ending at all. My heart went out to the little girl, which was one ending, my heart went out to Angela which was the other ending. All in all another good mystery about Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro.

He had promised to marry Carrie. They meet some good and some bad folks along the way. I guess that this is what life was about back then but it sure was tough. I did not like the ending. McCarthy has a way of making you feel for the people he writes about. You almost think you are there with them.

Batist is also a very good character. Burke lets you feel the pain and hurt Robicheaux has for himself and his love for Bootsie and Alafair. You can nearly feel the heat lighting and the dust from the roads. Many good characters, much suspense, a good ending. If you like Burke you will like this book, if you have not read him before I think you he will become one of you favoite authors.	2001-09-03

Please read it with a grain of salt. Mr. Hardin was not the hero he appears to be in the book. Some is fact but lot is fiction. He kills his first man at age 15, I think, then is really on the run from then on. He is quick with a gun and very good with a shotgun. He finally gets married and has two children. As usual, he is caught and pays the price, as set out by a judge and jury. Lots of shooting, lots of western clans involved. I am sure true to life at that time. Just don't believe he was as good as book leds one to believe.	2001-09-01

Everytime I thought I had it figured out a new twist would show up and here we went again. The book is hard to put down and the ending is very good. I really like the characters of Boldt and LaMoia.

Boy was that a mistake. It was way to bloody and gross for me. I may try the third one in the series but if like this one I will be through. The Angel Maker is bad, bad. I did not even finish the book and that is very unusual for me. When Dr. Elden Tegg cut the heart out of a man that was still alive and carried it, bouncing it like ball in his hand, down to the cages and fed it to one of his dogs, I left it. To much, way to much for me. If yo want a book full of blood and gore this is the book for you. If you don't, then pass this one by.	2001-08-26

It is the story of part of the life of Hewey Calloway. One of the last of the true cowboys. He hates to see cars, trucks and telephone lines. He is, I think, really what most of the cowboys were like. It is not full of gun fights and running from the sheriff. He is a hard working man that moves on when he feels like it. A real good story. Has places that are sad and many places that will make you smile. The ending is very good. I just got a happy feeling from reading the book. Makes me wish I had been Hewey Calloway.	2001-08-25

I was prepared to not like this book but it was fair. Anna Batory was a little unbelieveable. With no real police training she did better than the real ones did. I liked Jake Harper and Creek, they were more believeable to me. A killer is after Anna, no one can figure out who it is. Of course they finally do and that part ends ok but then the last chapter is added and the whole book does not end right unless Sandford is coming back with these same people. I doubt he is as the copyright is four years old. You are left hanging at the end. Part of the book is very scary and hard to put down, but because of the unbelievealbe Anna and the bad ending I only gave three stars. If you like a book with fast action but it doesn't seem possible then this is the book for you.	2001-08-23

True Justin wants Harding dead but there is very little of him chasing Harding. It is about the adventures Jusitn has as he goes futher and futher west. He finally comes to his senses and returns home to his wife. Then Harding finds him. It has a nice ending but is not what I expected.	2001-08-21

Have read several other books by Matt Braun and enjoyed most of them. I did not really like this one. Not much in it was the real life of Doc Holliday. It seemed like several chapters were a repeat of the previous one. Doc would get up, dress, go eat breakfast, go play poker, shoot somebody and then go back to his hotel. The next chapter he would be in a different town, get up, dress, go eat breakfast, go play poker, shoot somebody and then go back to his hotel. The towns changed and Doc always had to agree to show up at a hearing the next morning to explain the shooting. Was really disappointed in the book, started just skimming pages as it was so much like previous pages.	2001-08-19

It is a little slow in places, in my openion, that is why a 4 star instead of 5. It is the story of Glen Collins, an honest, hardworking blacksmith who is running for sheriff so he will be making enough money to ask Maria Silvas to marry him. Glen nearly get killed by the other person running for sheriff, Chase Lawson. But he is befriended by Roy Whitlow who saves his life. Roy then decides to run for sheriff and also ask Maria to marry him. There is quite a bit of action. The ending is very good. A quick read as the book is not all that long.

The bad to me was the great detail Sandford went into to describe what was happening to the computors and how that would screw things up. It was way over my head, I skipped several pages just because I did not understand what was going on. If you do read The Fool' Run and The Empress File, read The Fool's Run first. I did not because it says on the back of The Fool's Run, and I quote, &quot; Kidd and LuEllen return in Fool's Run. They do not return it is the first book. Part of the action is very fast moving. I liked the suspense of breaking into the houses and the handleing of the so called mob men. I enjoyed The Empress File better but neither one is as good as the Prey series. Read those if you want a good mystery. Read this one if you want to be reminded of the old &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; show on TV.	2001-08-14

I think this may have been the worst one. Parts of it were fair but a lot of it was so bad you can not believe it. Some of the things said and some of the things done were beyond believe. Example, a stagedriver twisted his leg reaching for a gun. The gunfighter drove the stage to the relay station and the driver was carried inside, they were going to try to get him to a doctor as he was in bad shape. Before daylight the next day, the driver was up, hitching up the whole team of horses and driving the stage in a chase from indians. His leg never mentioned again. Anyway, The book is about a man called The Gunfighter, even called Mr. Gunfighter. He is really Roan Malloy a U S Marshall. He is trying to find who is kidnapping women and taking them to Mexico. He does his job, finding friends and those who would kill him along the way. He is quick with his guns and his fist. He can speak three languages and is very smart.

I hate paying for some of them and then finding out I don't like them. Hot Springs is about Earl Swagger and his crew trying to clean up Hot Springs, Ark. The book has a lot of action and is very fast moving. Swagger is so very tough. He shows it in the houses they crash into and at the very end. He can handle all kinds of weapons and is very good at leading men. If you like a book with a lot of feeling about the life and times of the main character you will like this book.

Kenzie and Gennaro go from Boston to Florida and back again. People are getting killed all aroung them but the somehow come through it alive. Being shot at, car wrecks, being buried alive, gased, all just in a days work for these two. The ending is very good, I liked what they did. Hope they can hold it together now that they are lovers.

This is the story of Walks on the Wind. An Arapaho Indian that was never treated right by the white man. He ended up losing everything he had but I feel like this is true of so many indians of that time. On page 8, paperback, a statement is made, &quot;They kill our buffalo. They cut down our trees, they take our campgrounds and call it theirs. Then they give us back some of our own land and tell us to stay there.&quot; It tells the story of white men taking Indian land, building a town and then telling the Indians they will be shot if they show up there. One of the worst men was John Milton Chivington, a preacher turned soldier. He wanted to kill all Indians, did not matter what tribe, good or bad. I think this could very well be true story of the way the Indians were treated. I know there was good and bad on both sides but I think the whites broke more treaties, told more lies and did more harm than the Indians did at first. If you like to read about the early settlers and Indians, I feel you will like this book. As Walks on the Wind used to say each morning,&quot; There is beauty before me this day.&quot; Walks on the Wind lost his beauty.	2001-07-20

Agatha does her usual thing of asking questions and being a busybody. She finds a new male friend in Jimmy Jessop, a policeman, who asks Agatha to marry him. Agatha goes to bed with him but they don't have sex, not Agatha's fault. He later finds her in bed with Charles. Agatha decides she does not love Jimmy, she has never loved Charles, she is still in love with James Lacey. I have read all nine of these books. I really enjoyed the first ones, however, they are beginning to be like a soap opera. Agatha has become such a slut. She will go to bed with anyone to pays any attention to her. Don't care for romance, soap opera type books, so will be through with Agatha Raisin. I know  this will make no difference to M C Beaton, but will give me a little personal satisfaction. If you want a good mystery go somewhere else. I really hope Beaton does not mess up the Hamish MacBeth series like she has the Raisin series.	2001-07-15

Don't plan on reading any more. This one is about a teenage prostitute who is missing. Her very rich Grandfather hires Barrone to find her. She comes up dead, then the Grandfather hires Barrone to find her killers. There just never was any story, except the making of porn movies. There was no depth of character study. Not enough detail on things that were going on. I really enjoyed the Eagles Series and the EARLY Mountain Man books. I quit reading them because each book had several pages of flashbacks to previous books. Now I will quit reading the Code Series. Appears to me Johnston is after quanity and not quality. I know it will make not difference to him if I read another one or not but it give me some satisfaction.	2001-07-15

Lehane's first book, A Drink Before the War was good and this one is too. I think this one is more stomach churning. It was very hard to put down and do something else. Places in it are vey terrifying. Kenzie and Gennaro are caught in the middle of a serial killers rage. Are there one or two. Only time will tell. Several people Kenzie cares about are killed and most in a bad, bad manner. The end was good as the killer was caught but will Kenzie and Gennaro ever be the same again??? Wonder how the next book can pick up the peices and go on? If you like a book that will hold your attention and make you scared to go to bed, this is the book for you. You knows you lurks out there?? Will Patrick Kenzie be affected for ever? As it says on page 213 in paperback, \\" You can't clean sewers for a living and come home smelling like soap. It\\"ll eat at you, as long as you do this work. It'll hollow you out.\\"	2001-07-14

I have read all four books and enjoyed them all. Evan Evans is in his usual mode. A policeman that is concerned about the people around him. He does not use bad language nor is he trying to kill someone. In this book Evan has really two mysteries going at the same time. Who is setting the fires and who killed the man found dead after one of the buildings burn? How is the newcomer, Madame Yvette involved and is she Madame Yvette????? I like the barmaid Betsy and her play for Evan. Bronwen is his girl though, they make a good couple. I fear if they ever married it would not be good for the series. I can see the town of Llanfair and the surrounding countryside in my mind as I read, also the characters involved. Bowen does an excellent job of writing. Make me wish that is where I lived. I would suggest reading the books in order but I feel most will like Evan Evans and the people of Llanfair.	2001-07-12

This time there are two killers on the loose. On the West Coast and in North Carolina, however, they both end up in North Carolina. The Gentleman and Casanova are their names. This book is so scary, makes you want to look under your bed before going to bed at night. Who are these two men? You think you know but then you do not. This will hold you attention to the very end. I hated to put it down to do other things. If you like good mystery books you will like this one.	2001-07-11

Another good book in the Hamish Macbeth series. I enjoy these much better than the Agatha Raisin books. A group from a TV production company come to Drim to film a TV show. The scriptwriter is killed. Who could have done it? Several has said they would kill him. Was it Fiona, Patricia, Angus or Josh? Inspector Blair believes it was __________. Hamish is not so sure, then someone else is killed. Who killed the second person? Was it Gervase, Fiona or Shella? Hamish keeps digging until he comes up with an answer. As usual Beaton writes so you can feel like you are there. I can see the mountains and the mist in my mind. The characters are great and seems so real. Will be glad to read the next book. If you have not, please read one of the Hamish Macbeth books, I think you will like it.	2001-07-09

It grabed my attention from the first page and never let go. Pearson used outstanding police work in his book. It will let you feel like you are there. You can see in you mind what is happening, the fear, the anger, the thoughts that go through peoples minds. One killer??? Two killers???? How many??? How many will be killed???? Will he or they be caught before they can kill again???? A great book, in my humble openion. ...	2001-07-07

He did far better than I could do. Wil Hardesty is introduced as a PI. There are seven children found in graves after a flash flood. The father of one of the seven hires Wil to find out who killed his son. Seems as people close to Wil either get killed or hurt. I really liked the first 179 pages (paperpack) after that the book seemed to really drag until the last 10-15 pages. If you read it you can see what happened on page 179. I don't want ot say as it would take away from the story. There was a lot of talk and more talk after that. The book does end well but it was a long read, nearly but it down several times.	2001-07-01

This is the third Robicheaux book I have read. They all have been good. Dave is running for his life, he is to go to trial for a murder he did not commit. This takes him from the bayou to Montana. He deals with Sal Dio. A crazy man if there ever was one. Burke reveles more of Daves inter-thoughts. He shows a strong belief in God in this book. Burke can make you feel like you are there. The bad guys are after Daves little girl which is bad news for them. Clete shows back up in this book, is a friend again to Robicheaux. Dixie Lee Pugh also shows, a good old country boy from long ago. Burke weaves the people through their paces and make a very good story.	2001-07-01

This is a continuation of the Gordon Hawkes series. Gordon has lived for a few years in peace. But, then gold is found close to his cabin. He knows he has to move on but his son refuses to go. Cameron Hawk stays behind and is soon in trouble. Gordon comes back to avenge his son and will do anything to accomplish it. I liked what it said on the fly leaf, &quot;I am literally looking into the face of death&quot; This from a man looking at Gordon Hawkes. This book reminds me a little of the old mountain man series by William Johnston in his earlier books. The way Gordon goes about getting what he wants is very good. If you like stories about the old west and the mountain men you will like this book. Jason Manning is one of the best.	2001-06-28

Elvis Cole is introduced as a wisccracking private eye. Ellen Lang hires him to find her husband and son. Later the husband is found shot to death and the son is missing. Elvis, along with Pike, his partner, work on trying to get the son back. They come in contact with major drug dealers, one who thinks Elvis has his drugs. There is much action, one very good cop, and Pike is great. I think Elvis really had to many wisecracks. The ending is very good. I had a bad problem with Ellen Lang. Her husband is found shot to death, she was kidnapped and Elvis got her back, killing two in doing so, her young son is still being held by the drug dealer and she goes to bed with Elvis. I would think that would be the last thing on her mind and should have been the last thing on Elvis's mind. One of the writers on the back of the book compared Crais to Robert Parker, maybe in years to come but not now. The thing with Ellen and Elvis really turned me off. If it had been my child or grandchild kidnapped I would not have wanted sex with someone. Oh, well, to each his own. Have not decided if I will read another Crais or not.	2001-06-28

This is about Thomas Atherton who grew up in the East. He always wanted to go west and finally gets his chance to go and try to find the last buffalo herd. He is to report back to Cyrus Rutherford who wants to go kill the last of the buffalo. Along the way Thomas meets many interesting people. Sally, Moose and many Indians. After much time they finally find a herd of buffalo. Will Thomas report back, will he and Sally get together, what about Moose????? The story is slow moving in places. Does have a pretty good ending. If you want to read better McCarthy books, try, The Gringo Amigo, Blood Brothers, The Mustangers or Sodbusters. I think they are all better than the Buffalo Hunters.	2001-06-17

He continued after St. Germain who was responsible for his getting shot and other personal things that happened. Sarah was fair but Isiah Parker was wonderful. A book with him as the main character would be good. These three are deternmined to bring St. Germain down. <br />Are they able to do it. Read to find out. The ending is very good.

He is called back into service to help catch a killer who is abducting young women from malls and then doing strange things to their bodies. He is paired with Merci Rayborn, a young detective who has a short fuse and very impatient. The book has many twist and turns. It is not for everyone as part is pretty graphic. Parker does a good job of making you feel the thoughts of the people involved. I did not want to put the book down, especially the last several pages. Then I was afraid to put it down, afraid the monster man would come after me if he was not caught. A real thriller!!!!!!	2001-06-07

It shows the reason that the Kiowa's fought so hard for what was rightfully theirs. Shows the many promices broken by the many people in charge. I liked the ending. Am looking forward to the next in this series. Kosser does a good job of painting a picture of the country and the people. You can just see in your mind where they are and the hardships they are going through. The book will make you sad in places and happy in others. If you like books about how it was at that time and the rough life those people lead, you will like this book.	2001-06-03

Dave Robicheaux may be smart in some ways but not very bright in other ways. I could not believe that twice he got the stuffing beat out of him when he was not watching what he was doing or the people around him. He fights bad cops, a mob, has a contract on his life and a new girlfriend. Hi does take things in his own hands. The ending was very good, I liked it.

He comes back to his cabin to find his Indian wife killed and his adopted son carried off. Remember this is the same son that was carried off in \\"Stone Hand\\". He of course goes after the ones who did it and they are led by \\"Black Eagle.\\" The story line is about Jason going back to the army as a scout.

Can they be connected?????? Alex Cross is great as a detective. The mind games with him and Gary are breath taking. Jezzie Flanagan, with the Secret Service, gives you a big surprise. I don't know if Sandford's &quot;Prey&quot; series came first or Patterson's &quot;Cross&quot; series came first, but they remind me of each other. John Sampson is very good as Cross's partner.

I got a little tired of the talking about all good or bad things in life and the world around us. Other than that was very good. I was afraid it was a \\"Spencer\\" copy cat, but Patrick Kenzie is a man of his own and Angela Gennaro comes on big time. They are smart and very human. They make mistakes and are scared at times. They can shoot people and those they shoot make the world a better place. Their office is in the belfry of a church--pretty neat when they tell you why it is there. Has a good ending.... Remember, [Roland]is the kid, only 16 years old but street wise much older. A good story line and good moral character for Kenzie and Gennaro. She really did one good think with Phil, but need to read to find out what. Think you will enjoy this if you like a wise guy private eye and smart sidekick. Almost forgot Bubba, he has a very good part in the book, would like to see more of him.	2001-05-19

Lucus is his usual self, a good character, I missed the Nun and Del. Sloan and Franklin did not have as big a part. The ending leaves me to believe we are not through with the killer.

Along the way he is a robber, sheriff, buffalo hunter, scout for the army, indian fighter and various other things. He is smart and handles himself very well. The language is not to bad and the story moves very well. He is a great shot with a rifle as is proven in the book. He keeps coming across Bat Masterson and Will Bill Hickok. They become friends.

Allen Stancil was one as indicated on the fly page of the book. Then there was one named _______. Have to read to find out who did the murders. Not one but two. The book had its ups and downs. I agree with another reviewer, I get tired of all the brothers and sister in laws and their kids. I get them all mixed up. To many for me to keep straight. But then I guess I don't have to buy the book if I don't think I will like it. If you like down South folks and small town living where everybody knows everything about everybody else, then you will like this book.

I have read 10 of the Hamish Macbeth series, all have been good but I think this one might be one of the best. As usual Hamish is caught in the middle of a murder and then guess what---a second murder-----guess who finds both bodies? Beaton has provided plenty of good characters to go with Hamish and it make for a good light read. It won't scare you to death or cause you do loose sleep from fright but it is good. Hamish has to fight the bad Inspector Blair as always. I liked the part of the Smiley Bros. Could they make moonshine and be killers too???? How about Kylie, pretty but has bad, bad boy friends. A surprise in the end, many twist and turns. Priscilla finally shows up again, will they get back together???? Beaton leaves enough to let you know they will be more forth coming.	2001-05-06

Connelly goes with a different character in Terrell McCaleb, an ex FBI agent who has had a heart transplant. He gets involved in trying to find who killed Gloria Torres. There are many surprises along the way. I had a hard time putting the book down until I could finish it. Terry uses all his past abilities to tract down the killer. Then when he does find him, what happenes? Need to read to find out. A great book.	2001-05-05

It was not what I expected, from reading the fly page I thought it would be about cleaning up a police force with the good officers finally overcoming the bad ones. The book is really about a small time hood and his sorry gang. Smoke is the so called leader. He does very small crimes then he ends up killing and older lady. The last few pages describe how he is caught. To me it does not deal with cleaning up a police force. If you have read other Cornwell books I think you will be not like this one.	2001-04-30

The book started off real well and I thought it was going to be the best McCone I had read in a while, then, after Sharon found out who the imposter was,the rest was anti-clamatic. Then we got into a severl pages about the planes again. I agree with one of the other reviewers, the books were better when the stories were much more simple. When Sharon was with All Souls.

Secret Prey is very much like the other Prey books, but I enjoy most of them anyway. I gave it 4 stars because of the sex play again. I do wish Sandford would not do that as much. But, who am I to judge an author, I could never write anything. I do like Lucus, Del, Sloan, Franklin and Sherrill. Wish Lucus and Sherrill were not an item.

Beaton about Hamish MacBeth. I have read several of the MacBeth series and the Agatha Raisin series. They both are good but I think MacBeth is a little better. Agatha has gotten to jump in to many beds in the last couple of books. Hamish is his usual self, lazy but smart in solving murders. He can't stand the &quot;Macho Man&quot; and they are set for a fight, but do they get that far??? Later &quot;Macho&quot; is found dead. Was it Geordie, Annie,Andy, Willie, Archie or Rosie? It really could be someone else. Hamish get shot at!!!!! Goodness.... I liked the ending, keep hoping Hamish and Priscilla end up together, maybe in the last book.

I don't think this book is as good as some of the others in the series. I won't go into detail about what the book is about as it is well said in the above writings. I would just be repeating what has already been written. I felt like there were to many people involved. I could not keep up with who was who and who belonged to who.

The story line is well explained above so will just commit on my thoughts. I did not enjoy this book as well as the others. Agatha and James move on to Cyprus and leave the friendly place of Carsely. I have come to like the local characters in Carsely and missed them being in the book. The conflict between Agatha and James is beginning to remind me of a &quot;Soap&quot; on TV and I don't like that. I also can do without Charles, he is a pain, in my openion. Hopefully Ms. Beaton will move the next book back to Carsely and the people I have come to like.	2001-04-02

I have read them all through &quot;L&quot;. I thought this was one of the best ones. However, others seem to disagree. So be it. Kinsey is her usual bright, nosey self, asking questions and sticking her nose in other peoples business. I thought her impersonation of the hotel maid was great. I was nervous the whole time, afraid she would get caught, did she???? The other characters were good, to me. The granny with the shotgun was a good character. I could see in my mind the people as they traveled and as they tried to find the money. I would recommend reading &quot;L&quot;.	2001-04-01

Deborah's nephew, A.K., is caught turning over headstones in a cemetery, then a black church is torched and a body found in the ashes. Was A.K. involved is this too? It seems to me that a big part of the book was spent in talking about Deborah's family. I stayed so confused over whose child was whose and which brother was the 4th born or 2nd born or the third one up from her that I just never got into liking the book.

I have enjoyed all the Agatha Raisin books I have read. In this one Agatha is finally getting to marry James Lacey. But, her first husband Jimmy Raisin shows up at the wedding. Agatha thought he was dead. Later Agatha pushes Jimmy into a ditch and he is found dead in the ditch. Agatha is suspected of murder. She and James Lacey start their usual round of questions and callin on people to try to find the killer. Other people start ending up dead after talking to Agatha and James. After another close call the killer is found. Will Agatha and James ever get together again. I guess we will have to read another book to find out.

My favorite until now was Winter Prey, but Mind Prey may be the best one yet. They are pretty close. In Mind Prey, John Mail kidnapes a women and her two daughters. She is a Dr. who has treated John before for mental depresion. Really a nut. He carrries them to a old farm house. There he begins to rape the mother. The youngest daughter is carried away. The mother is told he carried her to a Wal-Mart and let her go, but did he???? Lucus it called in to try and find Mail and the woman and girls. The action is great. The mind games Mail and Lucus play with each other is very good. I loved the ending. Goody, goody. Through out the book Lucus is also trying to find a way to ask Weather to marry him. Does he ever do it???? A very good read if you like scary stories.	2001-03-17

AS usual I enjoyed another Agatha Raisin doing her thing. Her thing this time also gets her really involved with James Lacey. Agatha has returned to Cotswold village after six months in London. She is not back long before someone murders one of the walkers of dembley, a group that gets together and walks on the weekend. They follow old trails that have since been planted in crops. The farmers, of course, do not like this as it destroys their fields. After one is killed, another is killed. Who could be doing this? One of the walkers, one of the farmers, a lover? Agatha and Lacey keep asking questions until they figure it our. Or do they? I can see the village and the people in my mind as I read. Beaton does an excellent job if you will just let yourself go and feel the writing.	2001-03-16

I did because I thought it had to get better, guess what, it did not. In &quot;J&quot; Kinsey is hired to try to find a man that has been dead for five years. He had been spotted and the Insurance Company wants him found so they can try to recover the half-million dollars in life insurance they have paid out. The man is of course alive and Kinsey finds him and then he is gone again. Along the way she finds out she does have some cousins she was unaware of.

Have read several of the Agatha Raisin and Hamish Macbeth books. Have liked them all. Agatha is now trying to get into the flower business to impress her, want to be sweetie, James Lacey. However, there is a new WOMEN in town. She is Mary Fortune. Of course hard headed Agatha will not listen to anyone about when to plant her flowers and they all are killed by frost. She then decides to buy a load of flowers and get them planted during the night. Is like the time she bought a quiche instead of baking it for a village competition and one of the judges dropped dead of poisoning. Every one seems to love Mary Fortune, but she ends up being planted upide down in a flower pot. Agatha and Lacey, of course, start asking questions and trying to find out who the killer is. Could it have been Mrs. Bloxby, Miss Simms, Mrs. Mason, the Boggles or old Mr. Spott? I think the ending will surprise you. As usual Beaton has written the characters and the village so that they seem real and you can see them in your mind as you read. Am looking forward to the next book.	2001-03-09

Hamish would love to get rid of him so he could go back to his old way of doing things. The travelling man is Sean Gourlay, a traveller, something like a gypsy. He parks his bus on the Pastors property and Hamish cannot make hom leave. Then things begin to disappear, and people begin to change. Hamish is sure Sean is behind it. Then Sean is murdered. Hamish is really glad but he has to find the killer. Seems Sean was getting close to four ladies in town. Any of them would have done it. Also the restaurant owner wanted to kill him. But who did? Hamish also has to fight Inspector Blair, who wants to discredit Hamish before he gets another promotion. Will Hamish find the right killer? Will he ever propose to Priscilla? Will what the four ladies did be found out? Need to read to find the answers. I think you will enjoy the book. Great Scottish words and country.	2001-03-07

I rank this one close to the top. Spencer is hired to find out who killed Olivia Nelson. She was killed with many blows to the head with a hammer. The police have done all they can to find the killer but had no success. Spencer is hired by Olivia's husband. A trip is made back to a town in South Carolina, where Olivia Nelson came from. But is her real name Olivia Nelson? Yes, there is a person by that name but where is she? Why would a Senator want to keep Spencer from finding out anything? Spencer in jail?????? Many, many twists and turns. The ending is very good, really two endings, finding the killer and finding out about the senator. A good Spencer read! The only thing that would make it better, for me, would be less Susan and more Hawk.	2001-03-07

I have read &quot;A&quot; through &quot;I&quot; and &quot;I&quot; think I may be the best one yet. Kinsey is asked to help investigate a murder of six years ago. Isabelle Barney was murdered, her husband David was tried and acquitted. Now Isabelle's ex-husband is suing David in civil court,not criminal court, saying the jury made a mistake. Kinsey is hired because the previous PI died of a heart attack, or was it a heart attack, was he to close to the truth. David Barney talkes to Kinsey claiming to be innocent and everything he says appears to check out. So who did kill Isabelle and did the other PI have a heart attack. All makes for a very good book. The ending is great, a surprise to me, not so much for who did the killing but for the way it ended. If you are going to read these you really need to start with A and take them in order.	2001-03-06

Later she finds her niece in the house, beaten up and maybe a rape attempt. The young man who did this is found dead at the scene. Deborah has picked up the hammer used in the killing and therefore could be a suspect. As the story unwinds, her brother is in hopital from arsenic poisoning and the young man who was killed also had arsenic in his blood. The ending is a surprise but very good. I could see the town and the people in my mind as the story progressed. As very good book with what I would call a light mystery. If you want horror and gore, try Patricia Cornwell or John Sandford. I can relate to the family ties that are in the book. Just all around very good.	2001-03-05

It is hard to think a mystery would be enjoyable but the Agatha Raisin books I have read are. They don't scare you to death but they are fun to follow and see how they come out. Agatha is a funny, funny woman. The local Vet dies, is it an accident or murder? The police say accident but Agatha and her neighbor, James Lacey, think it is murder. They start asking questions and find the Vet. has gotten money from several different women, all of whom he promised to build  a new clinic and name it after them.

I figured he would be back as Eyes of Prey ended like it did. Davenport is called to New York to help find him, at least that is the reason first given. Then there is a story in the story, about the possiblity of Cops killing people. They want Lucus to try to find them as well as help on Bekker. Was very confusing to me, hard to keep the two seperate. Lucus is his usual bed hopping self. That I don't care for but I guess if I don't, I don't have to read them. The ending is good, but I just never got a good feel for the book. First one of Sandford's that I almost had to make myself finish.	2001-03-02

While he is out hunting a group of white men from Medicine Creek come to his valley and kill all of his people except for one and his wife who they take back with them. The story is really about how he gets her back and then she is taken again. The big scout the army sends after them is a good part. I really enjoyed the book. Anyone who likes stories of the old west and indians will enjoy this series. I kept wanting to cheer Little Wolf on. I so wanted him get his wife back and to take care of the ones responsible.	2001-02-27

Along the way she finds Diaz is connected to the murder of her friend Parnell Perkins. I thought the way Sue Grafton weaved the characters through this book was very good. Raymond is a nut and Kinsey's experience with the pit bull is great. Does Kinsey end up working undercover for the police? Is someone else working undercover also?

I started several times to just quit and go on to something else. It is about Jeston Nash, his leaving home and joining Jesse and Frank James and the &quot;Boys.&quot; He kills many, gets shot several times, and all the good things men did at that time. I think his best friend is Quiet Jack Smith. You can feel the characters some times but the book just never got to me like othes of Cotton's have.I think there are five more books in the Jeston Nash Adventure series but this one takes him all the way, at least it looks that way to me. I wonder if the others are just flashbacks to previous times. Don't think I will try any more.	2001-02-22

I have read several of Sandford's Prey books and this is one of the best. As usual, Lucus Davenport is the hard nosed cop. Murders start happening but they don't appear to be done by the same person even though they are alike. Lucus appears to have met his match in Dr. Bekker. There are many twist and turns before it ends. The last page is quite a surprise to me. If you live by yourself and are in an older house, where the floors squeek, I would not read this at night.

This is the first book in the three about Little Wolf. He was born a white boy by the name of Robert Allred. He was sold to a mule skinner. He later ran away after the mule skinner was killed by Indians. He himself was taken in by and adopted by two Arapahos. They raised him in the Indian ways and in his mind he was an Indian. He became a great warrior and was with Sitting Bull at Little Big Horn. He was a friend to Squint Peterson, a mountain man, trapper and scout. In fact Squint saved his life. This is Little Wolf's story, of his boyhood, as a young man and his fighting. I think it shows much of the bad, bad, ways Indians were treated. It is a good read and would recommend it for anyone interested in the American West.	2001-02-16

Jack Newlin confesses to killing his wife. Nearly, I say nearly, all the evidence points to him but his attorney Mary DiNunzio does not believe he did it. She thinks he is protecting his daughter. Mary sets out to prove he is not the killer. I like the two policemen, Brinkley and Kovich. I hope they are used in other books. Brinkley soon sides with Mary in thinking Jack is not the killer. But who is???? Is it the daughter, her boy friend, an attorney, or was it really Jack and he is turning everything around to look like it is someone else???? The book will hold you attention from the first page to the last. The ending is great. If you like mysteries you have to read this one.	2001-02-13

This is the seventh Kinsey Millhone I have read and I think it is the best one so far. It is really two stories going on at  the same time. Kinsey is hired to find the mother of a client and she also finds out she has a contract out on her for something else that happened in a previous book. She has to hire a body guard, Robert Dietz. I hope he is in some more books as I liked his character. The story held my attention all the way through. Usually I feel either the first or the middle of Graftons books are slow moving but not this time. Kinsey is her usually funny self in places. One is where she puts a sock in each cup of her bra and used it for earmuffs. I was a little confused about the missing mother during the last pages of the book but I am not to bright anyway.	2001-02-11

I think I like the series that starts with Montana Red better. This one gets a little out of the west with the trip to Chicago and a regular police force. Sullivan Hart and Twojack Roth are federal deputies hunting JT Priest and his coharts. They have killed Hart's father, who was also a deputy. They track him across the country to Chicago. They are helped by Quick Charlie Sims who is accused of robbing a bank, but it was robbed by Priest. Quick Charlie is a good character I hope he is used again. The last few pages are very good as Mabrey, another outlaw, in with Priest, is taken care of by Quick Charlie. Really like the westerns I read to be more set in the west. However, Cotton is very good and it makes for an interesting read.	2001-02-10

I like part of this one. I am just not smart enough to understand a lot of what was written about the sickness. I did like the name deadoc. I also enjoyed the language used on Tangier Island. As always Marino is one of my favorites. Dr.Scarpetta is in Ireland, teaching and investigating at the same time. While she is there a body is found in VA. that is like the Ireland caes. She discovers the body in Va. had a rare virus but no one knows for sure what. Dr. Scarpatta and Wingo, her assistant are exposed. Then a body is found on Tangier Island and it has the same virus. The terms and words used are above me. The killer uses e-mail to talk to Scarpetta and uses the name deadoc. The killer is finally caught and it is a very big surprise as to who it is. In the last few pages Scarpetta may finally get Mark out of her system. It is a tough read, maybe just for me. Cornwell has to be very smart to wrote a book like this. Expect to spent a lot of time if you read it. It will take it to try to understand what is going on.	2001-02-09

This is the 5th Kinsey Millhone book I have read and I think it is the best one. The others, to me, were good in the beginning and in the end but very slow in the middle. This one started a little slow but soon held my attention and was good the rest of the way. To start with Kinsey has $5,000.00 deposited in her checking account that she did not put there. No one know where it came from but it has her account number on the deposit ticket. She is then hired to investigate a fire in a warehouse for the Insurance Co. Kinsey knows the people who own the warehouse and even went to school with one of them. She starts to investigate and then part of her file turns up missing and Kinsey is accused of being on the take and turning in false information.  As she investigates she finds someone who died two years previous, a bomb goes off and someone else is killed and then a body turns up in a car parked in front of her house. One of her ex-husbands also comes into the picture. She keeps asking questions and finally solves the case. Not before she is nearly killed twice. I hope Sue Grafton continues to improve. I am looking forward now to the next one in the series.	2001-02-07

I did not want to put it down when I started reading it. Deborah Knott is ans attorney running for district judge. She is asked to  find out who murdered a woman eighteen years earlier. She starts asking questions and someone else is murdered, she keeps digging and there is another murder. Maron is a very good writer, she makes you feel like you are there and you can relate to the people involved. You will be very surprised who the killer is. At least I was. I gave it a four star instead of five because of the last two pages. I am so sad the book ended in this manner. I could not stand the lack of ethics. Talk about a gift. I really hate it happened this way. Can't say any more.	2001-02-04

This is the first one on McCrumb's books I have read but had heard they were real good. I found my self not wanting to put the book down, not because I was enjoying it but because I just wanted to get done with it. Sheriff Spencer Arrowood is a Sheriff in a small town. First a dog is killed, then a sheep and then a girl. We are led to believe a Vet. no one has heard from in 20 years is the killer. Peggy Muryan, a 60&quot;s folk singer is supposed to be the final target. No one solves the crime until the killer shows up. A lot of the book is spent planning a class reunion. I may try one of the MacPherson books but think I am done with the Ballard books. I know different people like different things but this is just not for me. If you have another author you enjoy I would read it and skip this.	2001-02-03

This book is the first in the series and the first one I have read. I really enjoyed it. I had read several of the Hamish Macbeth series, like them and thought I would try this. I am so glad I did. Agatha Raisin sells her business and moves to a small village. She is determined to become a part of the town so she enters the quiche contest, but she can't cook so she buys a quiche and enters it. She does not win but supposedly her quiche ends up at the home of Mr. Cummings-Brown. He dies from being poisoned and all fingers point to Agatha's quiche. Thery was a plant it it that caused his death. The police say it was a accident, after their investigation but Agatha thinks it was murder. She sets out ot prove it. Along the way are many, many interesting characters. Her good friend Roy, the people at the Red Lion Inn, so many good examples of everyday people. I could just see them and the houses they lived in  and the country side. An excellent book. I could just feel like I was there and I think it would be great to live in a place like this.	2001-02-02

Kinsey Millhone is given a $25,000.00 cashiers check to deliver to a 15 year old. A few days later the man that gave it to her turns up dead. The police believe he was drunk and fell in the water and drown but Kinsey belives he was murdered. She sets out to prove it. There are many good characters you met along the way. The funeral is fairly funny. Kinsely finally gets a witness who saw a blonde women with the man the night he died. But there are three different women it could be. You will be very surprised when the killer is found. The beginning and the ending were very good but I thought the middle of the book was slow moving.	2001-02-01

This one is about Zack King and his bride to be returning to their beloved mountains from visiting her people in St. Louis. They can't wait to get back to the Rocky Mountains and his parents and sister. They encounter a band of settlers who need his knowledge badley. He agrees to guide them because of the women and children they have with them. They experience a run in with the Pawnee. Later Louisa May Clark, Zack's bride to be, is captured by the Sioux. It is interesting how she gets away from them. The book is a fairly quick read. I did not like it as well as the ones about his father Nate King and his mother who is a Shoshone. This book is nearly like one of the others when Nate King led a wagon train himself.I hope David Thompson does not start repeating parts of his books like William Johnstone has appeared to do in his Mountain Man Series. If you like mountain men, early settlers and indians I would suggest the Wilderness series starting with Book one. I think the earlier books were better that this one.	2001-01-30

I read one and went back and read Rules, which is the first one and will read them in order. It got my attention on the fist page and held it all the way through. Lucas Davenport is excellent in his mind games with the killer. He does what ever he has to. I could actually feel chills going over my body when he finally figured out the mans name. Then could he get to the last kill on time or not????? I really did not like Jennifer Carey, I guess if the author has written a character so well you despise her he has done a good job. If you like a thriller that will hold you attention this is it.	2001-01-29

This is the 6th Lisa Scottoline book I have read and except for some loose ends and sometimes the language, I think it is the best one I have read. Bennie Rosato is a very good lawyer, she is contacted by Alice Connolly who claims to be her twin. Alice is in jail for a murder she says she did not do. Bennie takes the case and then begins to uncover a conspiracy between the cops involved an attorney and even the judge. A retired cop, named Lou, is very helpful. I hope he is used again. The case goes to trial, you don't know until the last if Connolly is guilty or not or is she is a twin to Rosato or not.And after the trail, what happenes to Connolly. It all has a very good twist to the ending, at least one I did not expect.  The action moves better than some of her other books and I enjoyed it very much. Would love to write the ending as it is very shocking but you will have to read the book.	2001-01-21

I enjoyed them all, some more than others but as a whole I like all of them. I even keep them and read some more than once, which is rare for me. Now comes Sunny Randall. It is the worst thing I have read that Parker wrote. All about a privite eye who finds a fifteen year old for her parents and then decides to not take her home until she can find out why she ran away. Sunny uses her ex-husbands mob family to get her into places and to see people she cannot do by her self. Spike is the answer to Spencers Hawk, I guess. I had to force my self to finish the book. I understand there is another Sunny Randall out in Hardback, guess who WON'T be buying it. I know Robert Parker could care less what I think if this book, but, I wish he would stick to the Spencer books which he does so well. This is about the same as Spencer and Paul in Thin Air. The names have changed but not much else.	2000-12-23

It is a thriller from the first page to the cliff hanger at the end. The Delta Force, the National Guard, the Inf. all trying to stop a rocket from going up. And the tunnel rats, boy I could not do that. I would die of fright. But, you can really feel what they are going through. Throw in a couple of spies and you have a great book. I really did not want to put the book down. It is a race against time and you are held in suspense until the very end. Would recommend for any who likes a lot of excitement.	2000-12-12

It did not grab me by the throat and cause me to not want to put it down as some of his others have. I stayed confused a big part of the time and really did not want to finish it but his other books had been so good I kept thinking it would better. I feel now that I wasted my time. Robert Flory, I suppose is the hero but it could be Julian Raines. So many people and so many things going on. The ending was really no surprise. Everybody has bad days or weeks, I guess or hope, this has been a rare bad write for Stephen Hunter. If this is a first read for Hunter it may be your last.	2000-12-03

It will hold your attention and you wonder what is going to happen next. Temple Brooks Gault comes to the surface again, this time in New York. But, he  shows up many different places. You expect him to walk into Dr. Scarpetta's office at any moment. As usual Captain Pete Marino is in rare form. My only problem is the adulty Dr. Scarpetta continues to commit with FBI Agent Wesley. I still think it cheapens the character of Scarpetta. I think of her as honest and upright. In fact,on page 281 she even had this to say,&quot; I will do more than threaten if people don't do the right thing.&quot; Then she goes to bed with a married man with children. Go figure.	2000-11-27

This is the second in the Code Name series. &quot;Payback&quot; was the first one and I like it better. John Baroone and his secret group of people light up the Southwest with guns, bombs and bullets. They fight outlaw biker gangs and crooked business men and the mob. Sometimes there are two or three against twenty to forty bikers. The two or three always win, go figure. This reminds me of his Mountain Man series which I enjoyed until the books started being filled with flashbacks to previous books. This appears to be the same story line as those books, just in a different setting. I think the earlier Mountain Men books and his Eagle series are much better that the Code series.	2000-11-26

Erskine Powell is a Detective-Chief Superintendent of Scotland Yard. He goes on an annual fishing trip and this is where the crimes take place. There are may suspects but Chief Superintrendent Powell finally figures it all out. I did not feel as close to Scotland as I feel with either M. C.

He is one of my favorite writers. &quot;The Outlaw Trail&quot; is no exception. It is the story of Sam Bass, a young boy who tried to go straight but fell into the wrong hands. He tells his story on his death bed. He died at the age of twenty seven. He was a Robin Hood type to many people. I would recommend this book to anyone who like western historical books.

As usual it held my attention and was hard to put down. The setting is North Carolina. Dr. Kay Scarpetta is her usual self and Pete Marino, who has recently been promoted to Captain, is in rare form. A young girl is murdered and there is the possibility it was done by Temple Brooks Gault, a character in a previous book that has killed many before and not been caught. I gave this a 4 star rateing as I was disapointed that Dr. Scarpetta character started commiting adulty with Benton Wesley of the FBI. Wesley is married and the father of children. I think it is degrading to the character of Dr. Scarpetta and takes away from the honesty she has always shown before. I hope this does not continue in other books as Cornwell has the ability to write an excellent book with out this affair going on. It may help to sell books to some, but it is a turn off for me. Please put Dr. Kay back as she was and let Wesley go home to his wife and kids.<br />Shame, shame, Particia Cornwell.	2000-11-26

I cannot say enough good things about him or Shelly Carr, or the good lady Doctor and of course the Iceman. The book was well written, held my attention and was believeable.

I was disappointed in it. I enjoyed the others. This one had to many things going on at one time, it was almost like trying to read five or six different stories at the same time. There would be a chapter about Marta, then one about the jury, then one about City Hall, then one about Steere, then one about Judy and Mary, then she would start over again with Marta. The material on Marta at the beach house of Steere was a joke, I know it is fiction but for Marta to do what she did in that much cold and snow is so far out it is unreal.
