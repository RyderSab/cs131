The writing is clear and concise and the examples given are crystal clear representations of the topic under discussion.  The illustrations are purposeful and not simply gratuitous eye-candy.    The organization of the book is superb.  It begins with the most basic and general record types a new researcher would need to access such as information from home and relative sources, civil registration, national censuses & parish registers.  Each subsequent chapter introduces more complex and specialized record types in descending order of overall importance to the average researcher.    It is as if Jean Cole and John Titford, two giants in U.K. genealogy world, are right with you holding your hand each step along your research path.    This is not a detailed reference work such as Mark Herber's \\"Ancestral Trails\\".  But if you could purchase only a single beginner's guide to genealogical research in the United Kingdom, Tracing Your Family Tree is the one to get.	2005-05-22

This book is a great resource about German genealogy for American descendants.  It's 600+ pages begin with information to understand German history, the immigrant experience and the records of genealogical importance that were generated as a result.  The next set of chapters give an overview on church & civil records and the repositories which hold them in Germany.  The advice given on the best way to approach these repositories is invaluable.  German references and finding aids are reviewed and then American record types are described with an emphasis on researching Germans in the United States.  The German educational system, language, fraternal organizations, customs, naming practices, military resources and religions are dealt with in detailed chapters.  The diverse geographic areas of interest beyond Germany itself are covered as well such as the origins of the Germans from Russia, German settlement of Pennsylvania and the former areas of Germany in the east.  This is a great reference for Americans seeking their German ancestors.	2005-05-22

First names have both history and context and George Redmonds has produced a much needed new study of them.  This is NOT a \\"what does my first name mean\\" type of book.  Redmonds has produced a social history of first names in England that has solid statistical backing.  His major new contribution is his use of the poll tax returns of 1300s to establish a statistical base from which to compare changes in name popularity and patterns over time.  He compares his data to that of other researchers to investigate the common questions about first name patterns.  Did saints' names loose their popularity as a result of the Reformation?  Redmonds has an interesting answer you might not expect.  What role did the godparents play in the naming of children?  What naming fads swept England and what were their sources?  This book puts holes in many previous works on name popularity that previously relied on their authors' perceptions without statistical support.  One of the best things about this book is that the author actually defines exactly what he means when describing a name as \\"popular\\" or \\"common\\".  The book's particular strength is in the north of England - the author's home turf.  The book is replete with copious examples in support of the author's conclusions.<br />The chapters include:<br />o A Transitional Period<BR>o Tom, Dick and Harry<BR>o The Popularity of Christian Names<BR>o Parents and Godparents<BR>o Names from the Twelfth Century<BR>o Names from Abroad<BR>o Names of the Saints<BR>o Names from Legend and Literature<BR>o Names from Surnames<BR>o After the Reformation<BR>o Changing Customs<br />An excellent addition to the genealogist's or social historian's tool kit, this book promotes the understanding of first naming patterns which continue to evolve to this day.	2004-05-21

Using an technique to estimate births and out migration for each English &amp; Welsh county, the author tests various generally accepted &quot;truths&quot; about the migration from England &amp; Wales of some 10 million people between 1861 and 1900.  <br />Did most emigrants come from rural areas which were left behind during the rapid industrialization of the period?<br />Did the varying cycles of economic growth on either side of the &quot;Atlantic economy&quot; clearly influence emigration in the directions expected?<br />Did the Welsh have a distinct emigration pattern which differed from English emigrants?<br />Was the composition of the emigrants primarily young unmarrieds or families emigrating together?<br />Did the emigrants leave England and Wales for good or was there significant return migration?<br />The author's conclusions are significant in changing our understanding of this large migration of people.  His conclusions on return migration, rural/urban origins of emigrants, information flows about conditions in the destination countries, and Welsh and West Country emigration patterns are extremely interesting.<br />This is an academic population study and reading it can be a heavy slog at times.  For those not inclined to wade through mathematical models of population and emigration, the author has provided convenient summaries for each chapter and an very useful concluding chapter.<br />A great way to better understand why our English and Welsh ancestors &quot;jumped the puddle&quot; and went overseas between 1861 and 1900.	2004-04-04

The translation is choppy and the text subsequently hard to follow.  Several of the authors have backgrounds in geology so the rocks of Britanny figure prominently in a book you would expect to be about ancient sources and archaeology in the ground, not the ground itself.<br />The subject matter is very interesting regarding the Dark Age migrations of the British to Britanny.  The major written sources, their limitations and silent periods are discussed in detail.<br />The authors assume the reader has a working familiarity with Britanny's geography and its post-Dark Age past.

Usually, authors prefer to focus on the differences between these two ethnic groups rather than their similarities.  Most of the evidence in the book comes from the heroic poetry from Beowulf for the Anglo-Saxons and the Godiddin for the British.  Individual chapters focus on social structure, military organization, poets, the hall, and more.  A good little book and a quick read.	2003-09-23

The author does a fine job of describing the biological imperatives of nepotism, classical nepotism, colonial nepotism, etc.  Those chapters detailing the successes and failures of different practitioners of nepotism through the ages are fascinating to read.<br />The specifically American version of modern nepotism is described by Bellow as being forgiving toward nepotism for providing entr√©e into social, employment and power positions so long as the beneficiary subsequently proves themselves by merit.  Family fumblers are appropriately punished in the author's view and family dynasties which fail the individual/generational meritocracy test do indeed go \\"from shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations\\".<br />The conclusion seemed like a cheap eraser jammed onto the end of an expensive mechanical pencil.  It appears to have been cobbled together in a hurry and does not read like carefully reasoned inferences drawn from the historical sections of the book.  The conclusion provides prescriptive attitudes regarding nepotism in modern society and this is by far the weakest part of the book.<br />The irony of writing about nepotism as the son of a famous author is not lost on Bellow.  This book will be a boon to nephew-hiring dynasts everywhere.	2003-08-23

The battle is perhaps the most well documented event in Pictish history because of the stunning defeat they inflicted on the Northumbrian Angles.<br />This short book reviews the circumstances of the events leading to the battle, considers various theories on the location of the battle, and the impact of the Pictish victory and Northumbrian defeat.  It considers the question of the criticality of the battle in ending Anglo-Saxon hegemony over the Picts and its effect on subsequent events in the North.  Did King Ecgfrith's defeat and death at the hands of the Bridei, Pictish king of Fortriu, mark the end of the golden age of Northumbria?  Did the Picts' victory set the foundations for the what would become the medieval kingdom of Scotland?<br />A quick and interesting read about the battle and its consequences	2003-07-11

Overshadowed by both his father Alfred and his successor √Üthelstan, he did much on his own to expand the domination of Wessex across all of England.<br />This book is a series of papers presented in 1999 at a conference on Edward the Elder held at the Manchester Centre for Anglo-Saxon Studies. Twenty-two papers by some of the most noted experts in their fields explore the archaeology, charter evidence, textiles, dynastic marriages, coinage, foreign relations, scriptorium production, and more of Edward the Elder's reign.<br />Of particular interest is the consideration of Edward's activities as king. Was he merely continuing his father Alfred the Great's program of recovering the Danelaw, fortifying the burhs, and incorporating Mercia into a comprehensive \\"Kingdom of the English\\"? Or did Edward follow his own policies in light of the opportunities he faced?<br />An outstanding multi-disciplinary insight into this much overlooked Anglo-Saxon king's rule.	2003-05-18

The history of Anglo-Saxon England is perforce centered on the kingdom of the West Saxons.  With the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle's focus on Alfred and the eventual establishment of his dynasty as kings of a unified England, Wessex has taken the spotlight in our understanding of this period of history.  However, Wessex did not stand alone against the Danes.<br />The central English kingdom of Mercia was a major source of support in the effort to re-conquer lands lost to the Danes.  While dynastic accidents prevented Mercian royalty from competing for the crown of all England, Mercia was vital to the unification process.  The history of this kingdom is represented by a much more limited set of surviving sources when compared to Wessex.<br />Ian Walker attempts to redress this imbalance by providing a history of the Mercian kingdom.  Most of the book focuses on the struggles with the Danes and the emergence of a unified England.  Without the co-operation and consent of Mercia, England would not have been formed under the Wessex kings.  Of particular interest are the sections on Lord √Üthelred of Mercia and his wife √Üthelfl√¶d, Lady of the Mercians.  The daughter of Alfred the Great, √Üthelfl√¶d's marriage to the ruler of Mercia helped ensure the critical co-operation between the two kingdoms in the darkest days of the Danes' hegemony.  √Üthelfl√¶d ruled Mercia in her own right for several years after the death of her father and husband - the only instance of a female to have done so in Anglo-Saxon times.<br />After reviewing the history of kingdom from King Offa of Mercia to King Edgar of England, the book provides two chapters on the composition of Mercian society and the Mercian Church.  Mercians in positions of power under Wessex and later English kings are given biographical treatment.  A highlight of the book is its consideration of Mercian art in building, sculpture & literature.  This is an excellent read and a much needed redress of the paucity of popular works on Anglo-Saxon kingdoms other than Wessex.	2002-10-19

Think that Baker over-made his case against the CIA/library conspiracy to destroy our print heritage?  You're right - he did.  In the interests of writing a ripping good yarn, Baker played fast and loose with the facts.  Remember, he's a novelist, not an investigative reporter.<br />Richard Cox brings years of professional archival practice and scholarship to bear on the fallacies of \\"Double Fold\\".  Cox rationalizes the debate by asking profound questions about how society should decide what it preserves among competing wants with limited resources, the best methods for preservation, and what the implications for Baker's solution of \\"saving everything\\" will be in our electronic age.<br />Most interesting perhaps is Cox's review of Nicholson Baker's public statements on the TV and lecture circuit regarding his \\"Double Fold\\" crusade.  Obviously, consistency is not one of Baker's hobgoblins.  He seems to have made a career out of repeatedly contradicting what he wrote in \\"Double Fold\\".  Of extreme value in Cox's response is his focus on how Baker has brought the previously private library science debate on what materials to preserve and how into the public realm.  Although he disagrees with Baker's caricature of librarians, Cox argues that the public perceptions of librarianship and archival responsibilities should be of extreme concern to the profession.<br />Cox doesn't just do a hatchet job.  He uses \\"Double Fold\\" with all its warts as part of his graduate courses for archivists.  Cox believes that Baker has done the profession a favor by shaking it up a bit and bringing preservation issues into public debate.  The only criticism I have of the book is that its arguments are at time redundant.	2002-10-06

A consistent thinker in the midst of our culture of conflict between fabricated absolutist alternatives.<br />This book is a collection of short essays on the state of American liberties which previously appeared in the \\"The American Prospect\\" over the past two years.  They have been updated with additional material to confront the issues in civil liberty which have appeared after 9/11.<br />Censorship, religious freedom, women's rights, and homeland security are just some of the topics covered in these bite-size essays.  The author's pen spares no sacred cows of either the Right or the Left.  The feminist movement's campaign against pornography is vilified with as much fervor as is the conservative effort to criminalize flag burning.  Both efforts are attempts at limiting unpopular speech.  Kaminer shows them both to be the silly shibboleths of sanctimonious speech suppressors.<br />I don't agree with the author's opinions on every issue covered in the book.  Her take on the criminal justice system, immigration, and social equality are a bit too left of center for my tastes.  However, I am proud of her right to her opinions and her courage to care about the rights of others with whom she disagrees.  If only we could all care with this much eloquence.	2002-09-17

For understanding Adomn√°n the hagiographer, Jennifer O'Reilly's \\"The wisdom of the scribe and the fear of the Lord in the Life of Columba\\" is both insightful and accessible to the lay person.  The article which summarizes the arch√¶ological activity on Iona is disappointingly brief.  The final article by Donald E. Meek regarding 21st century interpretations of Columba is fun reading for its ridicule of the modern \\"Celtic Christianity\\" movement and the uses to which Columba's memory is now put.<br />A solid backgrounder on Columba.	2002-09-11

I was severely disappointed.  Occasional inconsistencies of argument or a few personal correspondences noting the short comings of the markets do not turn the classical political economists into dyed-in-the-subsidized-wool interventionists.<br />Far from being a \\"secret history\\" of primitive accumulation, this book is a work of theory plain and simple.  I was really expecting more concrete evidence of the collusion of the classical political economists in the final phases of primitive accumulation in Great Britain, but this book does not present much compelling evidence to support its over-hyped premise.  Primitive accumulation was all over but the shouting in Great Britain by the time the philosophers turned their attention to matters economic.  The idea that intervention was required to move \\"self-provisioning farmers\\" (generously defined) into the factories as wage slaves is an appealing one.  But the book simply does not cite enough historical evidence to prove the point.<br />The author is half way through the book before he addresses Adam Smith's supposedly interventionist tendencies to promote the \\"early\\" capitalists.  Ricardo, Malthus, and Mill merit bare mentions.  I did give the book two stars for introducing the reader to some of the neglected political economists of the early period.  Overall, Marx receives the spotlight throughout the work.	2002-09-11

Why do we live in sovereign states now?  In the high Middle Ages, sovereign states were certainly not the only form of political organization in Western Europe.  Why did sovereign states first come to dominate Europe and then spread their model around the globe?<br />The author argues that there was nothing deterministic about the victory of the sovereign state.  It was not destined to be the most successful form of government and it had competitors.  The city leagues, particularly the Hansa, and the city-state, most notably in Italy, were all viable alternatives to the sovereign state up to the high Middle Ages.<br />By comparing the development of Capetian France, the Hanseatic League, and the Italian city-states, the author shows what political actors made which alliances with one another to the benefit or detriment of their particular political models.<br />A particularly fascinating book to understand how we got to the dominance of the sovereign state and excellent background for imagining a post-sovereign state world.	2002-09-03

If you're still seeking the Holy Grail of an &quot;historical Arthur&quot;, don't bother with this book.  You won't find any theories about a sub-Roman war band leader here.  This is a scholarly work about the Arthurian legend that does not seek to &quot;prove&quot; that Arthur, the man, actually existed.<br />This book is about whence came the IDEA of Arthur.  The author does review the extremely limited original sources which mention Arthur and then works to explain what the purpose was behind the idea of Arthur.  Who needed him as a symbol? How did they use Arthur for their own dynastic advancement?<br />The author focuses on the pre-Galfridian (pre-Geoffrey of Monmouth) Latin texts which mention Arthur. He provides historic contextual background to explain where these works were written, why they were written, and who their intended original audience was.<br />Once the original purpose for the idea of Arthur is established, the book then reviews the rise and fall and rise again of the Arthurian legend from the French troubadours to the Tudor kings on through the Victorians and up to the present day cults of Camelot.<br />An excellent and fast read for the general public about a scholarly topic that has been much neglected.	2002-09-03

What did they gain?  What did they loose?  How did the political consideration of these dynasts differ from the ecclesiastically written histories in their reasoning for conversion?<br />The book is divided into four sections.  The first deals with the sociological and anthropological theories regarding conversion.  The second reviews √Üthelbert of Kent's reaction to Augustine's mission to England.  The third section shows how Edwin of Deira used the new Christian cult.  Finally, the choice between competing cults (Roman Christian, Celtic Christian, and non-Christian paganism) and their use by the Bernician kings Oswald and Oswiu to further their dynasties' imperial ambitions is reviewed in detail.<br />The author is acutely aware of the ecclesiastical source material in which our understanding of this period of history is rooted.  He is honest enough to label his own theorizing as &quot;beyond proof&quot; based on the available sources.<br />This book is fascinating to read.  You will get a great deal more out of this political history if you read Henry Mayr-Harting's &quot;The Coming of Christianity to Anglo-Saxon England&quot; first.  Mayr-Harting's is the seminal work on the subject and will assist in your understanding of the traditional interpretation of the conversion period's history.

The author re-examines the earliest foundation documents of the Order and individual monasteries in southern France to compose an entirely different history of the Order's early years.  The concept of the Order itself was not invented until after Bernard's death and the General Chapter did not exert control until the last third of the Twelfth Century.  In a far cry from the traditional history, the author finds evidence that the Order spread primarily by incorporating pre-existing foundations including many double houses as well as women's foundations.  The incorporation of pre-existing monastic communities certainly better explains the Cistercian's amazingly rapid spread and success.  Instead of colonizing the wastelands of Europe, the Order took over areas already under cultivation.<br />There are more surprises in this volume besides those mentioned above.  The concepts of equality and charity, exemption from tithes, and other cherished myths of the Order are scrutinized using primary documents.  The book focuses primarily on southern France, the cradle of the Cistercians, and deals extensively with women's monasteries and the Cistercian's foundation myth's silence about them.<br />An excellent read and an essential book for anyone interested in the history of the Twelfth Century or the Cistercians.	2002-04-28

It's focus is on the strategy and tactics employed by Alfred in his campaigns, his guerilla war directed from Athelney, organization of a navy, and fortification of the strategically sited burhs.<br />It's a fast read and written by a veteran of the Burma campaign in World War II so it is chock full of soldierly insights regarding logistics, terrain, and morale.  Although focused on Wessex, the Danes, Franks, Mercians, East Anglians, Northumbrians and the Welsh are not ignored as participants in the various Viking raids and eventual settlements occurring in Northwest Europe.  There is a great deal of emphasis on the routes by which various forces moved across England and the trackways, Roman roads, and waterways used are given detailed descriptions.<br />I enjoyed it as a sort of Pop military history of Alfred.	2002-04-20

Focusing on the economic and military problems facing Gaul in the third century, the author concludes that this time of troubles represented a &quot;mid-life crisis&quot; rather than a &quot;decline and fall&quot;.<br />Besides it's consideration of Gaul in this period, the author also touches on Britain and Iberia.  Themes include the transformation of cities, the role of clerics in civic government, the Christianization of the countryside, and the Atlantic interface of trade and travel.<br />An enjoyable read using evidence from both arch√¶ology and from the surviving written sources.	2002-04-20

This is an overview of archological and textual record of Britain during this poorly understood period.  Its premise on the origins of the sub-Roman kingdoms of Britain is that prior to the official withdrawal of the Legions in 410, the primarily pagan secular elite of the British provinces were replaced by a Christian administration of low status origins.  After the failure of Constantine III to gain the purple, this administration adopted native British power structures based on kingship.  This theory can be used to successfully explain the decline of the villas, the rise of Christian ecclesiastics (based on Martinian militancy), and the introduction of pagan mercenaries who eventually created the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in the East.  The work is notable for its careful inclusion of Britain in the context of the wider remnants of the Western Empire. Better attested events and evidence from Gaul, Spain, Italy, and North Africa are used to explain what occurred in Britain.  This is a great read and arguably a part of the basic body of current knowledge and synthesis regarding the Dark Ages in Britain.	2002-04-04

We uncritically accept that a book which says it has been written by so-and-so an author is, in fact, an accurate representation of that particular author's ideas.  We believe that a book claiming to be published by such-and-such a publisher on this-or-that date has, in truth, come from that claimed publisher on that given date.<br />Most historians of the printed word have considered our acceptance of these claims as a pre-destined result of the factory-like uniformity of print.  A printed page can be exactly reproduced over and over again through printing, and this consistency lead the reading public to trust the claimed provenance of a printed materials in comparison to manuscripts.<br />Adrian Johns' &quot;Nature of the Book&quot; disputes the inevitability of a trusted print culture.  It did not arise as a mechanistic result of the printing process.  Rather, Johns' argues that it was the individual and collective efforts of printers, booksellers, authors, and others who successes and failures prepared Western society to accept a print culture based on propriety and trust.<br />Focusing on the Stationers' Guild of London in the mid-to-late 1600s and the British Royal Society of the early-to-mid 1700s, Johns highlights critical conflicts, collusions, competitions, cooperations, and crises which directly contributed to the trusted print culture we share today.  Johns is an historian of science and he uses the development of experimental philosophy as championed by the Royal Society as a prime example of how diverse interest groups struggled with the dilemma of trusting books the printed word.<br />In nine carefully focused chapters covering over 600 pages, the author builds his case that there was nothing inevitable about how our print culture evolved.  The corollaries to our modern struggles over the veracity of electronic media are obvious.  Western society has been in this position before and Johns does a wonderful job of telling the tale.  If history is goingto repeat itself, it will ultimately be the meatware rather than the hardware which defines the trustworthiness of our electronic information culture.	2001-10-09

Why did Europe in particular develop the prohibitions against marry close kin that are still with us today?  Why are a deceased spouse's siblings, the spouses of deceased siblings, various degrees of cousins, and god-children forbidden from being considered eligible marriage partners?  The ancient Israelites, Greeks, and Romans had no such prohibitions.  The Germanic peoples who settled northern Europe after the Roman Empire fell in the West did not carry these taboos with them.  Where did they come from?<br />This book argues that Fourth Century Christianity invented these marriage prohibitions which had previously not existed in either Biblical or Roman civil law traditions.  The effect, if not the actual purpose, of these prohibitions was to limit the number of inheritance strategies available to property owners.  By narrowing the options for trans-generational wealth transfers (including the virtual disappearance of civil adoption), the developing Church became the beneficiary of an increasingly large number of heirless people.<br />The wealth of the Church expanded to such a point that the lay authorities had to legislate against various accumulation strategies used by the Church - culminating ultimately with the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII.<br />The premise is a fascinating one and does a reasonable job of explaining why we have the marriage prohibitions which are with us today.  The first few chapters are a bit of a tough read as they set the anthropological ground work of the study.  However, the subsequent chapters are a historians delight.  Truly an innovative work.	2001-09-12

Disconnected ramblings sprinkled with historical trivia may be fascinating to listen to in a freshmen lecture hall, but such a style fails miserably in book form.  For all his obviously detailed knowledge of the subject, the author fails to coherently string together a premise, supporting evidence, or a conclusion.  I suppose this is the type of book one writes when one really doesn't have anything to say on a topic.<br />Sort-of based on the happenings surrounding the Black Death, this book doesn't ever come to any conclusions about the material presented - either original or in support of others'. The author plays fast and loose with historical facts and renders large doses of his highly personalized opinion on a variety of issues.<br />Don't bother picking this one up.

The Victorian cult of Alfred made him a marked man for the debunkers of the Dead White European Male focus of history.  Attempts at an even-handed review of the Wessex king's life are fraught with peril.<br />This book does the job magnificently.  Alfred the warrior, ruler, innovator, strategist, and moralist are all presented well within the context of a 9th century Anglo-Saxon world.  Alfred the pious and Alfred the ruthless are both shown as parts of the same man.<br />While concluding that Asser's \\"Life\\" is a legitimate source of biography for Alfred, the author does not limit himself.  Extensive use and comparison between versions of the \\"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\\" is combined with what limited charter evidence survives, archaeological discoveries and an examination of coinage patterns to round out the picture of Alfred and his times.<br />One major strength of this work is its very careful comparisons of Alfred and his activities to those of predecessor kings of Wessex and successor kings of the Anglo-Saxons.  Alfred's reign is not studied in isolation.  How Alfred was both traditional and innovative in contrast to his father and brothers helps place Alfred in the context of his times.  The legacy which Alfred left his descendants (to become kings of all England) is given special attention.<br />The author is circumspect in trying to get inside of Alfred's head.  Alfred's physical afflictions are examined with an eye to a modern medical diagnosis and their effects on Alfred's personality.  Using the marginalia in Alfred's own translations from Latin into the vernacular, the author tries to see inside Alfred the man - all the while cognizant that such a review is only speculative.<br />This is a great book and a very good read.	2001-09-04

Cohesively and convivially written as a review of the roots of our modern alphabet, &quot;Alpha Beta&quot; is a pleasure to read.  The author infuses the work with his enthusiasm for the alphabet both in its role as a technology and as a cultural icon.  The transmitted wisdom on the origins of the alphabet and the latest evidence from the archeologist's brush &amp; trowel are presented with well narrated places, events, and participants.<br />The author clearly has his favored theory on the evolutionary origins of A-to-Z and the single criticism I can level at the book is it's exclusive presentation of the Proto-Sinaitic path of development from Ancient Egyptian.  Some background on other possible lines of descent would have made the work stronger by their refutation.<br />The book is packed with interesting details and unexpected ripple effects regarding alphabet usages.  The Hebrew alphabet's success in promulgating monotheism is examined as an important effect of the adoption of alphabets.  The conditions under which some alphabets &quot;like to buy a vowel&quot; and others do not are also explored.<br />This is a highly enjoyable read - both entertaining and educational - which I can heartily recommend.	2001-07-11

This is an interesting book which describes the Phoenician expansion into the Western Mediterranean from the eighth to sixth centuries B.C.  The focus is the Iberian Phoenician settlements on either side of the Pillars of Hercules with Gadir (Cadiz) as the main attraction.  As the written record of the Phoenicians themselves did not survive, this work relies primarily on archaeological information and the small body of sources written by the Phoenicians' neighboring cultures (the Greek Homer's epic poetry, the Jewish Old Testament, etc.).<br />There is much discussion about the social, political, and economic reasons for the Phoenician expansion westward.  In addition, the form which this expansion took - from informal trade to outright colonization is explored.  A large part of the book is devoted to the competing historical theories regarding this expansion in which the author is obviously well-grounded.<br />Who engaged in the trade and expansion- the palace, the temple, or independent merchants?  How was it organized?  What were the ships like?  What were the commodities traded?  How were Phoenician relations with the indigenous peoples handled?  All these questions are answered.<br />There is obviously comparison between the original Phoenician settlements in the West and those of her daughter colony Carthage which succeeded them.  The emphasis in this work is on the Phoenician period rather than the following Punic period of settlement.  This is done to give the Phoenicians' initial accomplishments in the West due credit rather than have them overshadowed by Carthage.<br />With the book's emphasis on the Iberian peninsula, the Phoenician enclaves in the central Mediterranean such as on Malta, Sicily, and Sardinia do not get much attention.  I would have enjoyed more comparison between the Phoenician settlements and the subsequent Greek colonies in the West as well.<br />An interesting read on a little-known but highly-influential ancient people.  And don't forget to thank them for this alphabet while you're at it.	2001-06-09

The development of the use of footnotes in the study of history is an interesting enough subject.

Is a book an artifact or an information delivery system?  As an artifact, what should be done to preserve it?  As an information delivery system, what is gained or lost when the information migrates between platforms?<br />This is not Nicholson Baker at his finest.  This work is an expos√© written by a zealot from one of the opposing camps.  The usual music of Baker's writing is shrill and off-key.  There are still the occasional impressively gymnastic turns of phrase and perfectly placed make-words.  But Baker (self-admittedly) has an axe to grind and the sound of the grindstone predominates.<br />The author bewails the federally-funded &quot;preservation&quot; efforts of the past decades which have unbound, microfilmed, and discarded as pulp or curios hundreds of thousands of books and periodicals.  Original paper copies have been causalities of an ongoing &quot;war against paper&quot; and their microfilm (and now digital) copies leave much to be desired.<br />Baker savages the culprits involved and few in the highest circles of library administration over the last 50 years come away with reputations unscathed.  Apparently, the author sees a Cold War spook behind every book stack.  According to Baker, its seems almost the entire profession of American librarians was working for the Military-Industrial complex as sponsored by the CIA in the 1950s and '60s.  And you know what that means...(no, I don't know either, and Baker never makes it clear why the connection would be of interest to his arguments).<br />I use microfilm copies regularly and I admit that I hate them.  That they are not as ideal to work with as the originals.  That microfilm can be poorly made, riddled with errors, and subject to deterioration goes without argument.  But Baker comes from that rarified atmosphere of the academic researcher whohas the luxury of travel access to the great research libraries around the world.  Those of us who don't exist in that space are perhaps more grateful for access to the bad copies rather than wishing for the originals.  He makes an interesting analogy between the &quot;diamonds&quot; of the originals and the &quot;cubic zirconium&quot; of the copies.  Obviously, opinions on the object's sparkle will differ between jewelers and laymen.<br />Did the originals have to be destroyed to make the copies?  Baker argues persuasively that this was a false economy foisted on a complacent library-using public by disingenuous administrators.  Was a significant part of our nation's &quot;intellectual heritage&quot; lost in the process?  Baker is less persuasive on this question.  Any loss of original materials regardless of what they contain is presented as an unexplored tragedy throughout the book.  The loss of color illustrations from the days of Yellow Journalism, cartoons, marginalia in books, etc. are obvious on microfilm copies.  Is the world really a poorer place for not having their originals?  I wish the author had devoted more attention to this point because I came away from the book with the Scottish legal verdict &quot;Not Proven&quot; uppermost in my mind.<br />You have to admire the author for putting his own money where his mouth is and rescuing original American newspaper runs from the British Library.  His argument that a change in format of information does not require the destruction of the old format is an excellent one.<br />If you are a fan of Nicholson Baker's writing, this volume will probably disappoint you.  It reads like the commercial memoir of a war correspondent rather than the fine craftsmanship you'd expect from him.	2001-05-13

It picks up quickly however once the author gains his familiar territory of the Bible in English.  The narrative then clips along at an interesting rate as it describes the history of the Bible both before the King James Version, the great work on the KJV translation itself, and the global impact of the KJV to this day.<br />Fascinating bits of detail are scattered throughout the text.  Eight sheets of Tyndale's original 1525 Cologne printing were discovered in 1834 and show Tyndale's heavy dependence on Luther's German Bible in his first translation attempts.  &quot;In the Beginning&quot; does an outstanding job of exploring the creation and influence of the Geneva Bible - the market leader that the King James Version had to overtake.  Ever wonder why the Apocrypha was dropped from most Protestant English Bibles?  &quot;In the Beginning&quot; explains this post-KJV phenomenon in terms both religious and economic.<br />A minor annoyance in the book is its tendency to repeat turns of phrase.  A statement or quote in one paragraph can be immediately followed by the same statement or quote in a following paragraph.  The text could stand a good scrubbing to rationalize these redundant references.  Also missing were any biographies on the lesser known contributors to the KJV translation teams.  The paucity of our historic knowledge about these translators may explain this omission.<br />The best part of &quot;In the Beginning&quot; is its exploration of the KJV's impact on our language. Tyndale &amp; the KJV translators did much to preserve the Hebrew phraseology and linguistic cadence of the Old Testament.  The work delves into how English took both translated Hebrew phrases but also methods of sentence structure as its own.  It explains why the KJV translators adhered to forms of English which were already archaic to them in 1611.  The subsequent history of the King James Version's elevation to its consideration as one of the defining works of all English literature is told with both awe and humor.  Much is made of the receiving generations' assumption that the KJV was THE Bible rather than a mere translation.<br />This is an outstanding and very readable work of popular history.  You will never hear or read the English language the same way after reading &quot;In the Beginning&quot;.	2001-05-08

As they are both new releases on the same topic, this review will be somewhat comparative.<br />The strength of this work is that it reads like biography.  Tyndale, Coverdale, Henry VIII, Wolsey, More, Cromwell, Elizabeth I and James I are well covered.  What little information about the lives of the teams of King James Version translators is also included.  &quot;Wide as the Waters&quot; gives as much attention to the politicians involved in the religious controversies surrounding the history of the Bible in English as it does to the theologians and translators.  &quot;Wide as the Waters&quot; paints James I to be a canny statesman and competent theologian himself whereas &quot;In the Beginning&quot; makes James out to be Archbishop Bancroft's compliant puppet.<br />One minor detail that was annoying about &quot;Wide as the Waters&quot; is its method of source citations.  The author uses the quotes of others liberally but their attribution is placed in the back of the book and indexed only by chapter and page of the text.  This made figuring out who was being quoted more cumbersome than necessary.<br />Where &quot;Wide as the Waters&quot; fails to deliver is in its final chapter.  The KJV's impact on the English language, literature, religion, and political thought is not very well defined in its last chapter.  The connection between the KJV and the eventual English Civil War, Glorious Revolution, and American Revolution is rather fluffy.  The book's subtitle &quot;The Story of the English Bible and the Revolution It Inspired&quot; is simply a marketing tease not substantiated by the text.<br />Read &quot;Wide as the Waters&quot; for fun but read McGrath's &quot;In the Beginning&quot; for understanding.	2001-05-08

Prior to Edward I's reign, the assumption was that &quot;time out of mind&quot; was about a century prior to the present.  The date before which legal proof of rights was not required had previously been moved forward in time as required: the date of Henry I's death followed by Henry II's coronation followed by Richard I's coronation.  But there it stayed fixed by Edward I's statutes.  Time out of mind was prior to September 3, 1189.  After that date, it was expected that written records rather than human memory would confirm legally valid grants of rights.<br />The development of a written culture of everyday affairs covers many sorts of artifacts and concepts.  Tally sticks as bills and receipts, personal seals functioning as signatures, why we began signing with an &quot;x&quot;, and the number of pounds of sealing wax used by the King's Chancery over time are all explored in this book.  The development of heraldry as part of the shift from memory to written record is also commented on briefly.<br />The author carefully studies the question &quot;Were laymen literate?&quot; and tries hard to make the reader understand what being literate meant in this period.  Our modern concept of someone who can read AND write simply doesn't fit with concepts held at the time about literacy.  The author's conclusions on the pervasiveness of literacy in this period are surprising.<br />Throughout the book, the very different reasons for and processes surrounding the making of a record, the keeping of a record, and the using of a record are carefully differentiated.  This is an outstanding work of history for the student of literacy, of medieval history, and of legal history.	2001-04-24

While this non-linear presentation works well in cyberspace, it is a frustrating thing to deal with in book format.<br />It is heartening that a classics professor would tackle a subject like the change from print to electronic technology.  His comparisons between the coming of the Internet and the rise of the codex in late antiquity are interesting.  He clearly &quot;gets&quot; the Internet and doesn't consider it the big bad book-slayer.<br />The author sprinkles in some of his theories on education, particularly post-secondary.  He poses interesting questions but provides no answers to those questions about the purpose of post-secondary education in the modern world.<br />Some of the ideas presented were compelling, the style of the book was difficult to handle, and his final comparisons between himself and Cassiodorus were a bit much.  I could only give it two stars.	2001-04-24

Using the proto-orthodox views of Separationist, Docetic, Adoptionist and Patripassianist beliefs, the author studies the earliest existing copies of what became the New Testament for clues to the controversies and their effect on what was actually written in these copies.<br />Christology is the center of this study.  What the heretics believed in opposition to what the proto-orthodox believed about the nature of Christ are the only parts of the developing canon which are scrutinized.  Scrutinized is perhaps too broad a word.  The author puts the various extant texts under an electron microscope of scholarly inquiry.  Textual variants, external attestations, transcriptional probabilities, and intrinsic probabilities of what parts were &quot;original&quot; and what parts are &quot;improvements&quot; are culled with a fine toothed comb.  Have a good Greek grammar handy because many of the arguments hinge on a verb tense, word substitutions, genders, possessives and antecedents.  I have no Greek so many of the proofs of these arguments were beyond me.<br />Did second and third century scribes change what became the New Testament as a result of Christological controversies within the early Church?  It would appear so based on the evidence presented in this book.  The author is throughout charitable to these individual scholars of long ago, recognizing that he can only guess at the motivations of these anonymous men of the pen.  The evidence that they made what was written in the developing canon &quot;say&quot; what they already knew the words to &quot;mean&quot; is compelling.  Besides giving insight into how these texts were transmitted to us, the book also provides a potted historyof the various heretical controversies of these early centuries.  I found it to be a hard read on a fascinating topic.	2001-03-16

This is a very detailed diplomatic history of the causes, international ramifications, and results of the Italo-Turkish war over Lybia and the Dodecanese islands.  Very little information regarding the war itself is given as this is almost exclusively a diplomatic history.<br />Italy, a second rate power still smarting from their defeat in Ethiopia, used the French extension of power in Morocco as cover to invade Ottoman-held Lybia under the flimsiest pretenses.  Quickly controlling the coastal regions, Italy soon found itself in a military and diplomatic stalemate with the Ottomans in the Lybian hinterland.  Great Power indifference lead to an expansion of the war to the Aegean and a temporary closing of the Straits.  It was only the beginning of the First Balkan War which threatened Ottoman possessions in Europe which hastened the Porte to the bargaining table.<br />The internal politics at Constantinople and Rome are both thoroughly discussed as background to the diplomatic maneuverings of both nations.  These are particularly interesting given the turbulent situation in the Ottoman government at the time.  Turkey's future alliance with the Central Powers and the Italian government's predilection towards fascism have their roots in the events of this period.  Italy's schizophrenic diplomatic stance with Turkey (robbing them in North Africa while propping them up in Europe) is fully explored.  Diplomatic archives from both Turkey and Italy have been thoroughly utilized by the author.  Primary sources from the foreign ministries of the Great Powers are also used to show Europe's reaction to this war.  Secondary sources such as political memoirs give the main actors' apologia for their actions and Europe's subsequent death spiral into the Great War.<br />This is a fascinating and detailed rendering of what second and third rate power diplomacy was like at the end of the Concert of Europe.	2001-03-10

This work was originally published in 1972 and thus does not reflect the most recent archeological information available regarding the Christianizing of the Anglo-Saxon peoples.<br />It is still a very enjoyable read.  The author has a lively style which flows well over the entire subject.  Events and people both great and small are considered in this comprehensive story of the  conversions of the Anglo-Saxon peoples to Christianity. Gregory the Great, Augustine, Theodore, Bede, and finally Boniface all loom large in the narrative.  The author is more charitable to Wilfrid than most.<br />I am hard pressed to find fault with this work.  However, while the Irish influence on Anglo-Saxon Christianity is thoroughly explored, the dealings of the Anglo-Saxon Church with the remaining British Christians in only lightly discussed.  The author, perhaps due to the times in which he wrote, is less-than-critical of his sources and takes the workman-like &quot;they're all we've got, so let's make the most of them&quot; attitude.  This makes for good narrative but for poor source analysis.<br />On the whole, I enjoyed the book and can recommend it.	2001-02-20

It's rather amazing that these local conflicts were not the &quot;damn silly thing&quot; and did not erupt into a wider conflict.  It would take Princip's shots at Sarajevo to spread the flames of war to the Great Powers.<br />Much of the belligerent nations' subsequent diplomatic decisions can be attributed to the events and results of the Balkan Wars.  Bulgaria's alliances with Germany in the subsequent two world wars are clearly rooted in the Balkan Wars.  Serbia's actions and the Austrian reactions to them were first choreographed during the Balkan Wars - with disastrous consequences in July of 1914.<br />The book provides excellent background on the early 20th century conflicts which incubated today's controversies regarding Macedonia, Kosovo, and other lingering Balkan animosities.<br />The author makes the point that in the Balkans, there was almost no pause between these wars and the  beginning of the Great War.  Many of the belligerents were engaged from 1912 until the Armistice of 1918.<br />Because of the short time between the end of the Balkan Wars and the beginning of the Great War, the author argues that the military lessons of the Balkan Wars regarding machine guns, quick firing artillery, and aircraft reconnaissance could not be properly absorbed by the military tacticians of the day.<br />Of particular interest to military historians is the book's description of the Gallipoli campaign during the First Balkan War in which the Turks conducted an amphibious assault against the defending Bulgarians.  The Turks were able to make good their lessons learned from their attack when they were in the reverse role of defending against the British and ANZACs in 1915.<br />The Great Power conferences which finalized theresults of the two Balkan wars were like the last symphonies in the Concert of Europe.  The Balkan belligerents had to maintain one eye on their patrons among the Great Powers as they pursued their territorial goals.  Never again would Great Power diplomatic pressure alone be successful in redrawing the borders of Europe.  For example, the birth of the Albanian state as a result of Austrian and Italian interests against those of Serbia and Greece was a major outcome of the First Balkan War.<br />I could only give this book three stars due to some shortcomings.  The maps are simple line drawings and do not provide enough detail to adequately support the text.  The author has a habit of &quot;giving away&quot; the results of a battle before his description of the entire event is complete.  For example, indicating that control of a road would be critical to an army's eventual retreat before describing the actual battle.  Finally, the author has a predilection towards perfect hindsight judgments regarding the belligerents' ways and means.<br />Overall, a nice and short read on a little documented prelude to the Great War.	2001-02-07

I am neither a lighthouse enthusiast nor a Stevenson literary junkie but still managed to enjoy my time spent reading the book.<br />I can see where this blend of biography, history, and engineering would be too thin to please serious lighthouse fans, literary historians, or marine engineers.<br />However, for the general reader, the book succeeds nicely in combining a selected history of the Stevenson family, their works for the Northern Lighthouse Board, and the family's impact on Robert Louis Stevenson.<br />It is an interesting account of the difficulties overcome in the creation of some of Scotland's most magnificent lighthouses.  The author knows how to turn a fun phrase which adds to the reading a bit of an Easter egg hunt for bon mots.<br />The typographical errors previously mentioned have been corrected in the paperback edition.	2001-02-03

This is a first-of-its-kind work in English to review the Imperial Russian Army during its crucial period of modernization from 1861 (just after Crimea) to 1914 (the eve of the Great War).<br />The author is an instructor of strategy at the US Army Command and General Staff College and is an outstanding writer of military history.<br />The defeat in Crimea lead to changes in organization, doctrine and strategy for the Russian army.  It's involvement in the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-1878 and the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-1905 gave it operational experience from which to learn (or fail to learn) the lessons which a rapid change in military technologies taught on the battlefield.<br />Russia was one of the very few European powers to fight major, non-colonial wars in this period which saw the introduction of smokeless powder, magazine rifles, quick firing artillery, and machine guns.  Contrary to popular belief, the Russian army did take active measures to adapt to the new military technologies along with improvements in transportation (railroads) and communications (telegraph, field telephones, and radio).  The Russian army from Alexander II to Nicholas II was not a hide-bound, unintelligent mamoth as it is so often depicted.<br />The author divides the work up neatly by periods and his writing flows smoothly between doctrine, strategy, organization, and operational history.  The politics of the Tsarist regime, the personality conflicts within the Tsar's army, and the technical changes on the battlefield are all woven together into a comprehensive whole. It is an excellent review of how the Russian  predilection for reliance on &quot;cold steel&quot; held up during the changes forced by the Industrial Revolution.<br />I give it all five &quot;bayonets&quot;.	2001-02-01

This book alphabetically lists old terms for diseases, cures, and practitioners.<br />Did you know that corn smut (a fungus found on corn) was used for stimulating contractions in childbirth?  That &quot;summer complaint&quot; was infantile diarrhea or that &quot;phossy jaw&quot; was the result of over-exposure to phosphorus?

The author is a professor of anthropology at Kansas State University.  It is a quick and easy read even if you managed to avoid anthropology classes in school like I did.  References in the text are conveniently relegated to the ten page bibliography.<br />Students of human societies will find this book fascinating of course.  Family historians who may find that their lines &quot;cross&quot; more than once due to cousin marriage will also learn a great deal from this book.  The acceptability and legality of cousin marriage has varied over time and cultures for a variety of reasons.  This book is a guide to understanding those historical and cultural reasons.  From Leviticus to Archbishop Parker's Table in the Book of Common Prayer, marriage prohibitions based on the degrees of consanguinity have effected how our families combine for millennia.  This book is important background to understanding how families came to be the way they are.<br />The book examines the social and legal prohibitions against cousin marriage in the United States by reviewing their history and comparing U.S. prohibitions to laws and customs about cousin marriage around the world. It reviews the biological evidence regarding the negative impacts of cousin marriage. Finally, the social impacts of cousin marriage and its prohibitions are briefly discussed.<br />Thirty-one U.S. states have some form of prohibition against cousin marriage.  Nineteen states have no such prohibitive laws.  No European nation prohibits cousin marriages.  Why do these prohibitions exist and why the variance between nations and states?  This book answers those questions directly.<br />The author argues that such prohibitions were a late nineteenth century enforcement of the bio-evolutionary belief that cousin marriage threatened the civilized status of the United States.  Cousin marriage was seen as step towards a &quot;less developed&quot; or &quot;more barbarous&quot; level of human society.  States entering the Union prior to about 1860 did not have laws against cousin marriage.  Almost all entering after 1860 prohibited cousin marriage to some degree.  Clearly, the legal prohibitions began long before modern genetic science could provide any guidance on the issue.<br />The now commonly held assumption in America today is that the prohibitions against cousin marriage are to prevent cousins from producing less intelligent or otherwise &quot;less fit&quot; offspring.  We often point to the Royal houses of Europe as examples of the negative effects of cousin marriage.  The hemophilia carried by Queen Victoria and passed to many of the other Royal houses through inter-marriage is often erroneously used as a specific admonition against the practice of cousin marriage.  Successful marriages between first cousins, such as Charles Darwin and his wife, have been uniformly ignored in the popular mythology of this taboo.  The Darwins produced ten healthy offspring, several of whom were just as exceptional as their famous father.<br />The author argues convincingly that modern genetic science does not support the prohibitions against cousin marriage.  Genetic concerns about offspring have nothing to do with the marriage of cousins and everything to do with the frequency of particular &quot;bad&quot; genes in the population and the individual likelihood that a specific couple will produce offspring effected by a particular &quot;bad&quot; gene.  The slightly (very slightly) increased risk from detrimental recessive genes in the offspring of blood relatives argues for genetic counseling rather than outright prohibitions against particular marriage partners.<br />So if genetic science is no help in support of the prohibition of cousin marriage, why are the laws still on the books?  The author hints at an interesting theory just at the end of the book.  Noting that the creation of prohibitive laws against cousin marriage coincide with the massive waves of immigration into the United States from the mid-1800s to the 1920s, the author suggests that such prohibitions may have been designed to help stir the Melting Pot.  The author's corresponding tie-in of his theory to the marriage prohibitions promulgated by the Roman Catholic church in the early Dark Ages is pure genius.  I won't &quot;give away the ending&quot;, but the book is worth reading just for the author's theory on the acculturation factors which may underlie our cousin marriage prohibitions.	2000-12-20

In particular, the book focuses on the  transition from a rural, peasant society based on subsistence-oriented agriculture to a market-dependent economy.<br />By looking particularly at the period from the end of serfdom in England to the dispossession of the majority of the English population from the land, this historical review of the rural economy falls into both the late Medieval and early Modern periods of history.<br />The book takes a detailed look at one village in northeast Norfolk - Marsham - and the primary manor in the village - that of Hevingham Bishops.  The manorial rolls of this manor are compared to its neighboring manors for details about tenure and transfer of land.  In addition, surviving wills &amp; parish registers from Marsham and several additional parishes are reviewed to determine family relationships, inheritance strategies, and information on landless families.  Finally, tax assessments, quarter session rolls, and church warden accounts are used to provide information about wealth distribution and wage labor rates.<br />By studying the local data within the limits of the time boundaries mentioned in the title and the specific region described above, the author provides a fascinating look at economic life of that particular area of Norfolk.<br />This book contains many interesting insights into the lives of this rural population.  The market for land bought and sold between tenants was active from the earliest period.  The annual &quot;hiring fairs&quot; for agricultural and domestic servants were not common in the period - hiring being done throughout the year.  Different villages benefited from the Worsted trade in differing degrees.  There is much more.<br />A truly fascinating economic micro-study of one part of Norfolk's amazing history.	2000-12-11

The progress of their efforts across the Indian landscape makes for fascinating reading.<br />The amazing accomplishments of the Survey in the face of fever, tigers, and other resistance are highlighted in the book.  The naming of Mount Everest is but an historical afterthought to the incredible saga of the Survey itself.<br />This entertaining and highly readable book does touch on some of the social, political, and scientific ramifications of Survey - but only briefly.  The narrative is driven by the progress and setbacks of the Survey itself.	2000-11-11

Don't understand the global financial markets?  We'd best regulate them back to the days of Bretton Woods.  Crowded cities?  Invest in public transportation.  Education in disarray?  More public funds to the decaying public education machine.  Afraid of private industry being granted patents on genetic sequences?  Public ownership is the obvious answer.<br />The difference here is only one of accent.  The author begrudgingly and with apparent difficulty admits that the private sector does play a leading role in economic growth and technological innovation.  Words like &quot;greed&quot; and phrases like &quot;filthy rich&quot; abound.  It's clear that the author is uncomfortable with the private sector's victory over the Left.  He does his best to use the word entrepreneur without gritting his teeth.  He is simply ideologically unable to recognize that the real engine of growth and innovation is the motive of individual gain.  I got the distinct impression that the author learned just enough about business and technology from his work as a business journalist to obtain the jargon without really understanding what he's talking about.  Perhaps this is why journalists shouldn't hurt themselves attempting to explain economics.<br />This book was about five years out of date at the time it was published.  If you've read any of the recent work of the leading futurists, this book will be entirely rudimentary to you.  The author is still filled with wonder that he can work from home with a laptop and free-lance his skills on the open market.  This has been a way of life for some of us for years.<br />When dealing with world-changing technologies in genetics and information processing, the author really didn't have a grasp of what he was writing about.  It read more like regurgitated columns from a Sunday newspaper than like a serious student's musings on technology's impact on the global economy.<br />As an apology for the failures of the public sector in the new economy and as re-assurance to the defeated Left that there remains a role for the Nanny State, this book will be a success.  Anyone who is already living and working in the new economy needn't waste their time reading what they already know.<br />If Tony Blair really is taking advice from this guy, heaven help Britain.  It's a day late and a Euro short.	2000-11-08

In his chapter &quot;Invention of Tradition: The Highland Tradition of Scotland&quot;, he details for the reader where the supposedly &quot;ancient&quot; costume of Scotland came from.  The kilt was invented by an English Quaker about 1726 to allow his Highland workmen to more easily move while smelting the iron ore he was extracting.  The kilt was thus an expression of the Industrial Revolution rather than an ancient freedom of the heather.<br />The &quot;setts&quot; of tartans purporting to show a particular pattern of plaid belonging to a particular Highland clan is an even more recent invention.  The concept of a unified group wearing the same tartan began with the English formation of the Highland regiments in the 1740s and later.  The Scottish cloth industry recognized a good thing when they saw it and with the help of the Scottish Romantic movement and with promotion by Sir Walter Scott, by the 1820s, Clan/tartan pattern books (which often disagreed with one another) were happily catering to this invented tradition.<br />Invented by mis-guided or plainly fraudulent &quot;antiquarians&quot;, the concept of particular tartan patterns being associated with a specific Clan is one of the long-running jokes played by the Scots on the rest of the world.  Rather like the game of golf.	2000-10-26

Gives the historical background, foundation, and progress of the &quot;re-baptizers&quot; as their critics called them.  The ministries of the early Anabaptist leaders are followed in detail in both Switzerland, Germany, and Holland.  After a historical review of each leader's influence on the movement, the latter half of the book provides a detailed examination of these leaders' positions on matters of doctrine such as infant baptism, the trinity, pacifism, the swearing of oaths, the ban, and civil authority.<br />Perhaps the most interesting sections of this book relates to the  ongoing and violent persecutions which befell the early Anabaptists.  Not only the dominant Catholic hierarch but their fellow Reformers made martyrs out of the early Anabaptists.  The arguments and misrepresentations made against the Anabaptists by their Catholic and Protestant tormentors helps to define what these people did, in fact, believe in.<br />A great book for understanding where the Mennonites, Hutterites, and other Anabaptists came from.	2000-10-25

While the title implies the book's focus will be London's &quot;Great Stink&quot; of 1858, it is in fact a short biography of the eminent Victorian civil engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette.  Less remembered than his fellow engineers Isambard Brunel or Robert Stephenson, Bazalgette was the Chief Engineer of London's Metropolitan Board of Works for some 30 years.<br />During his tenure, he oversaw the construction of the great intercepting sewers of London which effectively removed the recurring threat of cholera from the city even before that disease's transmission mechanism was fully understood.  In addition, the great Embankments along the Thames were designed and built by Bazalgette which make the modern waterfront as we know it today.  He also built three bridges still standing across the Thames and designed many of the modern thoroughfares of London.<br />This book focuses on the long political battles waged in Parliament, the press, and within the City itself to solve the massive problem of human waste disposal in the world's largest western metropolis of the day.  Although ostensibly about a civil engineer, there is not much engineering in the book - making it highly accessible to the layperson.  Copious contemporary illustrations out of &quot;Punch&quot; and the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; along with lengthy quotations from &quot;The Times&quot; make the Victorians' view of this smelly problem come to life.  It's fortunate that this is not a scratch-and-sniff book.<br />The main chapters include those devoted to the invention of the water closet (a sewage nightmare), cholera and sanitation, and the building of the embankments.  Throughout the book, small sidebars give potted biographies of key players and interested parties of the day such as Dickens, W.H. Smith, Gladstone, Dr. John Snow, and others.  These are great little tidbits on the people featured in the main narrative and they are liberally sprinkled with caricatures from &quot;Spy&quot;.<br />Thebook does touch on Bazalgette's early endorsement and use of Portland cement as a technical innovation as well as the quality assurance testing techniques that he enforced during his projects.  So engineer, take heart!  There are interesting bits for you as well.<br />If dark places under the heart of the metropolis is your area of interest, see also &quot;London Under London&quot; by Richard Trench &amp; Ellis Hillman for sewers, the Tube, and more subterranean passages.  And if you simply must have olfactory re-enforcement to imagine the past, try &quot;Victorian Vapours&quot; by Mary J. Dobson.	2000-10-13

I devour just about any book I can get my hands on about pre-Dreadnought warships from the period 1860 to 1904.  This book is nicely illustrated and the battle diagrams commissioned for the book make it worth the purchase price. However, it is not a very detailed history of this period of naval innovation.<br />The narrative comes off as a gloss of other recent works such as &quot;Warrior to Dreadnought&quot; by David Brown, &quot;Ironclads at War&quot; by Alessandro Massignani, &quot;The Long Arm of Empire&quot; by Richard Brooks, and &quot;Field Gun Jack Versus the Boers&quot; by Tony Brigland.<br />The book is written by a retired Rear Admiral of the Royal Navy and if you read quietly, you can faintly hear &quot;Britannia Rules the Waves&quot; playing while you turn the pages.  While the RN dominated this period, the book suffers from being a bit too chauvinistic regarding British innovations and abilities versus the rest of the world.<br />There are a few incorrect dates and a couple of pictures which are not representative of the period under consideration - probably due to the book being part of a general series on the history of warfare rather than a specialist naval book.<br />Contemporary photos, prints, and artwork are found throughout the book and it is a visual pleasure.  The campaign maps and 3-D battle diagrams including Kinburn, Sweaborg, Lissa, Angamos Point, the Yalu, and the Yellow Sea are outstanding.<br />With a focus on the Royal Navy, the book does give many pages over to the American Civil War and does a nice job of including the South American wars involving pre-Dreadnoughts as well as actions in the Far East.<br />I would buy this book over again, I just wish it were more substantial.	2000-10-13

This is a fantastic history of what's underneath the ground of today's London. Blending history, geography, and engineering, this book describes the smothered streams and covered rivers, the water pipes and sewers, and the tunnels under the Thames.<br />A major section is devoted to the London Underground - the &quot;Tube&quot; - and its history. The Post Office's automated mail-handling railway is briefly touched on as well.<br />The role of London's underground spaces during wartime is reviewed including the underground factories and the Cabinet War Rooms of the Second World War.<br />The book is profusely illustrated with a heavy emphasis on contemporary cut-away and explanatory drawings.

What made the myth of an armed populace ready at a moment's notice to defend our liberties against foreign invasion or internal tyranny?<br />Great question and this book frames it well. But it doesn't do a very convincing job of answering the question. The problems facing the Founding Fathers regarding a nearly-useless militia and a largely unarmed populace have been well documented in the past fifty years or so. The myth of the minuteman was put to rest long ago. Unfortunately, the majority of this book simply heaps more dirt on the grave without doing much to explain where the myth actually came from.<br />And that's where the author really misses his mark. It is a eulogy to the myth without sufficient explanation of where the myth was born and raised. It seems as if the author's research was cut off in the middle due to a rush to get into print on this topical and commercially-viable issue.<br />Ending the book at the Civil War with the modern arms industry still in its infancy does no justice to the commercial propagation of the myth. Neither is the ongoing literary and popular cultural expression of the myth explored much past Appomattox Courthouse. This is a real shame because the book leaves you asking for more.<br />If you accept the book's premise that the gun culture arose in the late 1800s rather than in the 1700s, then the book piles on the evidence that it did not exist in the 1700s. But how did it come about? Why is it so prevalent? Who made it so? These questions are not simply not answered.<br />The author's comfort area is clearly with the culture and records of the 1700s as more and more historical inaccuracies creep into the narrative as the books winds up at the Civil War. I think the author must have been rushing at that point because to consider repeating arms to have had any noticeable impact on the outcome of the Civil War is clearly in error. Furthermore, George Custer's men did not carry repeating rifles although their Indian opponents did. The 7th Cavalry has been shown by archaeologists to have been greatly out-gunned at the Little Bighorn. Trivial errors perhaps, but it does make one question the accuracy of the other statements the author makes regarding the prevalence of firearms, their use and function in his comfort era of the 1700s.<br />I was disappointed in this book and I can only hope that a &quot;Part II&quot; will some day make the work a solid whole.	2000-10-05

If I ever learn to write, I'd like to be able to write like John Humphrey.<br />Masterfully weaving a combination of history, theology, and a thorough knowledge of the extant records, the author creates a tapestry of knowledge for the researcher confronting baptismal records.<br />While focused in early Pennsylvania before and during the Revolutionary war, that Commonwealth's great flowering of religious freedom allowed many differing denominations to exist side by side. For this reason, the book is not just about Pennsylvania baptisms, but about the baptismal practices, record keeping traditions, and limitations of baptismal records for all the major denominations which found their way to America's shores in this period.<br />Did your Catholics or Lutherans come over later? This book will still help you understand what might be in their local parish registers - both in the Old Country and here in America. And why don't the Quaker's baptize? <br />I could go on with more examples of why this book is outstanding. Suffice it to say that in my personal research, this book helped me to better understand why the baptism records were made the way they were.<br />I particularly enjoyed this book's coverage of the problems faced by parents out on the early frontier when they had an infant to be baptized. The paucity of clergy and the rarity of paper books goes a long way towards explaining the problems you'll encounter when searching for a pioneer baptism.	2000-09-21

A very interesting and highly readable account of the development of our  modern system of passports.<br />Passports have not always been a requirement  for crossing international boundaries.  The invention and spread of the  concept of a nation-state first in Europe and then around the globe has  seen fluctuations in various governments' requirements for both internal  and external travel documents.  The mercantilist monarchies attempted to  retain tight controls while New World migration required no entry documents  at all.  The free trade liberalism of the 1800s brought down some passport  requirements such that fictional Phineas Fogg could dash off around the  globe with no passport other than a carpet bag full of  banknotes.  The  20th Century saw the re-introduction of many formerly relaxed passport  controls.<br />Beginnning with the French Revolutionaries' pre-occupation with  travel controls, the book covers the development of passport requirements  in the formation of the German nation, observes the great changes in  passport restrictions following the First World War, and ends with a review  of passport controls in the modern era, including the development of  &quot;international&quot; passports for Displaced Persons.<br />This is an  excellent study which shows how passports have fit into modern nations'  changing needs to identify both their own citizens and foreigners.  The  author argues persausively that a nation's ability to differentiate  &quot;insiders&quot; from &quot;outsiders&quot; is one of the primary  definitions of a nation-state.<br />Great reading for those interested in the  development of the modern state, in the development of travel controls, and  in the history of identification documents.	2000-09-09

Once a family historian has exhausted all Federal census records and  worked through all the vital records available to them, they must use  alternate sources to hunt their elusive ancestors.<br />State census records  are one of the under-utilized alternate sources for American genealogical  research and Ann Lainhart's book is designed to make finding state census  records easier.<br />Organized on a state-by-state basis, &quot;State Census  Records&quot; tells you for each state WHEN non-Federal censuses were  conducted.  In cases where the state censuses did not cover the entire  state, the counties which were included are listed.<br />The book describes  WHAT questions were asked by that particular census so that a researcher  may estimate the research value of each.<br />Finally and most importantly,  &quot;State Census Records&quot; tells you where these censuses are  available: various state archives, the Family History Library and its  associated Centers, other libraries, or in published form.  Publication  information for printed census records is given in full.<br />If you have  ancestors who moved around the United States between the decennial Federal  censuses, this book is the essential reference you require to figure out  where to look next for them.<br />There are other benefits in using state  censuses as well. They asked questions different from those on the Federal  censuses - some of which are genealogical gold mines.  For example, one  Iowa census asked for mother's maiden name.  State census records may not  be restricted by the 72-year closure rules that apply to the Federal  censuses.  Some state censuses taken as recent as the 1940s are already  available.<br />Perhaps the most common reason that state censuses are  consulted is due to the near-complete loss of the 1890 Federal census.  There were, however, many state &amp; territorial censuses taken in the  years 1885, 1892, and 1895 which can help make up for this loss of the  Federal census.<br />&quot;State Census Records&quot; is one of the primary  reference works for American genealogy.

How did tens of thousands of Germans and Irish arrive in America before  the War for Independence?<br />How did they decide on the journey?  What  factors turned their heads westward instead of to the eastern settlement  schemes of Prussia, or the Austrian or Russian empires? Where did they get  their advice from?  Who led the Germans down the Rhine?  How were they  collected for trans-Atlantic shipment?  Which middlemen profited from (or  exploited) the &quot;trade in strangers&quot;?  What were the costs of  their passage?  How were they received in the valley of the  Delaware?<br />This scholarly book addresses the earliest trans-Atlantic mass  migration to North America - those immigrants from southwestern Germany and  northern Ireland who arrived prior to 1775.  It answers the above questions  and many more.<br />Our immigrant ancestors didn't just jump on a boat one day  and arrive in the New World many weeks later without an entire system of  personal and commercial contacts, information flows, and market forces to  facilitate their passage.  The huge influx of Germans prior to the  Revolution followed a very complex chain of immigration which ensured that  ships sailing to Philadelphia from ports in Holland carried  &quot;Redemptioners&quot; rather than mere ballast.  This book is primarily  focused on their experiences.<br />The later and lesser pre-1775 Irish  immigration differed significantly from the German experience both in  immigrant composition and geographic mix between the northern counties and  the southern counties of Ireland.  Elements of the both the German  immigrant trade and the Irish immigrant trade prior to the Revolution set  the pattern for all later migration in the 1800s.<br />If you have Palatine,  Swiss, or other German ancestors who landed in Philadelphia prior to 1775,  this work is a fascinating study in understanding what they were up against  - the &quot;system&quot; that moved them and the challenges they faced  within that system.<br />Using both first-hand accounts and statistical  analysis of diverse sources and studies, &quot;Trade in Strangers&quot; is  an excellent  way to understand early German and Irish immigration into the  New World.  Its focus is primarily the German immigration into the port of  Philadelphia but it does mention why other destinations in America were  less successful at attracting these immigrants.  The smaller Irish  immigration prior to 1775 is dealt with to a lesser extent and is mostly  used as contrast for comparison to the simultaneous German  immigration.<br />The elements of the system of immigration to America which  were to remain constant until at least 1924 are highlighted because they  were first used to channel these two early immigrant streams from Germany  and Ireland.<br />This is a  thoroughly-researched and well-written book.  Historians of the American colonial experience, students of immigration,  and family historians may all profit from reading this.	2000-09-03

Its focus is on  the records behind the medals.  It was a tradition in the British military  to  inscribe medals awarded to soldiers with their name, regiment, and  often service numbers.  This means that these baubles of cloth and metal  are not mere keepsakes, but actual links to an individual's past.<br />Medal  collectors, military historians, and genealogists will all find this a very  practical guide explaining how to flesh out the story behind the medal by  consultation with the available records.  Most of the records discussed are  held at the Public Record Office but the author also discusses sources  including those found with the medal (cases, telegrams, etc.) newspapers,  and other libraries, museums and archives.<br />The volume is profusely  illustrated in black and white with period photos, close-ups of medals, and  examples of the records involved.  It is a very good step-by-step guide for  learning the history of a serviceman based on their medals.	2000-07-28

What were the events that caused that famous part of the Western Front to form around the little Belgian town of Ypres during World War One?<br />This small volume provides the answers and it is a gem to read.  It follows the  British Expeditionary Force of the Great War during the months of October  and November, 1914 - the battle known as First Ypres to the British.<br />This  was a critical (and ultimately fatal) time for the BEF.  The  war was still  one of movement and this period saw both the Allies and the Germans  attempting to flank each other while closing the lines of battle towards  the coast.<br />The book goes a long way towards explaining the  &quot;why&quot; behind the eventually static positions of the trench  warfare in Flanders.  It's interesting to read about topographical features  such as chateaus and woods which still stood in their original form when  the opposing armies first arrived and came into contact.  The remains of  these same features would become famous as points of reference on the  barren hell-scape of the trenches in just a few months time.<br />The book  does assume that the reader has knowledge about the course of the war up to  October of 1914.  The retreat from Mons, the Marne, and the BEF's position  on the Aisne are touched on only in a cursory manner.  For the prelimiaries  to First Ypres, see Barbara Tuchman's general introduction &quot;The Guns  of August&quot; or more specifically Richard Holmes' &quot;Riding the  Retreat: Mons to the Marne 1914 Revisited&quot;.<br />Written in the mid-1960s  by a British author, the book is not overly jingoistic.  It does a fair and  scholarly job of viewing the action from the German point-of-view.  The  author's criticisms of the BEF's leadership is present yet  understated.<br />Perhaps the author's only (understandable) fault is his  lionization of 'Tommy Atkins' - the British common soldier.  That they were  a completely professional army with more than their share of courage isunquestionable but the author tends to focus on the saints rather than the  sinners in the Old Contemptibles' abilities to withstand superior numbers  (often at 7-to-1), disaster, confusion, and poor leadership.<br />My great  great uncle soldiered with the 3rd Cavalry division of the BEF and was  wounded in October, 1914.  This book gave me a clear idea what he had been  up against.  The BEF was bled dry at First Ypres and ceased to exist as a  fighting force due to their exertions.  They had bought time for Lord  Kitchner to train and equip his &quot;citizen-army&quot; to fight in 1915,  but Britain had forever lost its small professional army.	2000-07-27

Far from the counter-cultural icon of a Renaissance Thoreau, this volume puts Sir Thomas firmly in the context of  the Establishment of his time.<br />I couldn't put the book down for the  fascinating insights it gave into the social hierarchy in which More moved.  A child of privilege, his position in the newly-risen and literate middle  class of London was one of relationships and obligations.<br />His attraction  to what became the Humanist movement is presented as an intellectual  dalliance at odds with his basic system of beliefs.  He enjoyed the  intellectual freedom it afforded but his spiritual and emotional constants  remained unaffected.<br />In the end, it was his upholding of tradition which  condemned him in an era of change.  His martyrdom was one of dying to  maintain the Middle Ages against the coming modern world rather than of  individual conscience.<br />An excellent read that you will be hard pressed to  put down.	2000-07-24

It's a very cold day in Hades indeed when I give a negative review to genealogy book - particularly one on English genealogy.  However, this book was simply terrible.<br />The premise - that interesting insights into surname  distributions and migration patterns in England may be determined by  reviewing and then comparing different sorts of record types which include  surnames - is a fascinating one.<br />Unfortunately, the author approaches the  subject in a chatty, &quot;let's ask the questions and find the answers  together&quot; fashion which is almost completely unreadable.  This  &quot;shared voyage of discovery&quot; methodology makes reading this book  a bore.  I say this having read several hundred genealogy books, so it's  not the subject matter I refer to as boring - it's the writing  style.<br />Another problem with the book is that it is written in  &quot;British English&quot; complete with colloqialisms and inside-jokes  which were off-putting even to an unreformed Anglophile such as  myself.<br />Besides stylistic issues, this volume does not examine the source  materials used for its study with anything approaching enough criticality.   Using telephone directory discs for modern surname distributions is a great  idea except for all the ex-directory people, the multiple telephones per  household slowly becoming more common, and the inherent errors in any phone  book.<br />For the next historic period of surname distribution, the author's  review of the Victorian censuses reads like a schoolboy's essay.  The  problems of thorough coverage regarding the censuses are legion yet they  are brushed aside by the author.<br />This book is a tough read and its  premise is not particularly well argued.  If you're an English surnames  junkie, you'll want to give it a go (tidbits like Fuller, Tucker, and  Walker all being regional variations of the same occupation are nice little  gems) but as a general genealogy work for hunting English ancestors, this  book isto be avoided.	2000-07-21

This introductory book is primary focused on the use of the census microfilm available for England and Wales at the Public Records Office in the United Kingdom.<br />However, the information provide is of great use to  the researcher with English or Welsh ancestry for understanding how the  censuses were taken, how they are currently organized, and how best to  access them.<br />The section on &quot;Finding Your Place on the Film&quot;  describes the PRO's microfilm numbering system which is useful even when  you use the films at the LDS Family History Centers since they are copies  of the PRO films.  Understanding the PRO reference numbers makes research a  great deal easier.<br />The section on &quot;Understanding the Returns&quot;  contains many wonderful gems from the original enumerators' notes.  Be  prepared to laugh at their inventiveness in describing some occupations and  the reasons why they were unable to  count everyone in their area. Humorous  and insightful examples are used to illustrate the book throughout.<br />One  set of illustrations which I found particularly helpful were the sample  street maps showing how an enumerator might &quot;walk&quot; the street -  thus explaining the order in which households were recorded in the census  returns.  <br />The appendixes include a complete list of registration  districts and their numbers for each census and various street index  finding aids (invaluable for hunting ancestors in the larger cities).	2000-07-21

David Hawkings is a Fellow of the Society of Genealogists in the United Kingdom.  He is well known for finding otherwise &quot;undiscovered&quot; sources for family history in the archives of the UK.  He brings his  considerable expertise full force to this topic.<br />From very early on, the  criminal justice system in England and Wales maintained some outstanding  records of its workings.  For a genealogist, criminal records of various  kinds may be the only way possible to &quot;flesh-out&quot; a  difficult-to-research ancestor.  It's not just criminals who appear in  these records, of course.  The victims, plantiffs, and witnesses are also  mentioned, give statements, etc.<br />Hawkings guides the reader through a  multitude of record types and enhances his explanations with illustrations  and liberal use of transcribed records given as examples.<br />The various  courts in the land and their records are discussed along with  transportation records to both America and Australia.  Prison and police  records are also covered.  The book ends with a very illuminating case  study.<br />This is a thick book with relatively small print (get your  magnifying glass out) thus it is packed with information &amp; examples.  Very good value for the money.<br />A great resource for anyone tracing  ancestors in England and Wales.	2000-07-05

The ancient Greeks and Romans wrote without punctuation to interrupt their texts.

Not every custom and tradition is a direct descendant of Celtic  religious rites. Humanity has been very adaptable to inventing new  &quot;old traditions&quot; as the need arises and our earlier ancestors  where just as good at fulfilling these needs as were the Victorians who  invented our concept of an &quot;old fashioned Christmas&quot;.	1999-10-30

Taking what is printed in book form as truth has  been a typical problem in genealogical research for decades. Funny how  things never change much.

The field of genealogical research in Great Britain is littered with literature.  This scepter'd isle has a long history of excellently preserved source records, an enthusiastic community of genealogists, and a wealth of authors willing to guide the enthusiasts through the records.   Given this background, it is difficult to imagine that a new work on British genealogical research could quickly become a new \\"standard reference\\".  Mark Herber has made his Ancestral Trails just such a standard.  Ancestral Trails, written in association with the Society of Genealogists in the United Kingdom, is 688 pages of top quality writing, organization, and completeness of coverage.  It takes a textbook approach to the subject of genealogical records, leading the reader from the more basic sources such as civil registration and parish records on to the more specialized such as military and educational records.  Far from being dry in style, the author uses well chosen examples from his own years of researching his ancestors to explain how the record types in question can be used by the family historian.  Some authors who use examples from their own research can detract from their work by doing so.  In contrast, Mark Herber has made his personal examples of real research situations enhance the text because of their relevancy to his topics.  Nearly one hundred examples of significant records are included as illustrations.  Researchers experienced in using British records as well as beginners will find this encyclopedic guide useful.  The author covers newly-available resources such as the 1881 Census Index and provides excellent research advice and several clever shortcuts to using this new finding aid.  Those researchers with Essex ancestors will be doubly blessed by this book as many of Mark Herber's examples are from research in that county.  The extensive bibliography really sets this book apart as a new standard reference.  Almost one thousand bibliographic references are conveniently referenced from within the book's 30 chapters.  Researchers familiar with  particular record types will be pleasantly surprised to find Ancestral Trails referring to an exhaustive list of other works on the topic.  The author's writing style lucidly describes the important considerations when working with a record type and seamlessly refers the reader to the more specialized works of other authors for greater detail.  Ancestral Trails is a thick and thorough tome and an excellent addition to the research knowledge of anyone with British ancestry.	1998-03-03

Very detailed descriptions of the naval architecture of the Royal Navy from the introduction of the ironclad through to the Dreadnought.  The details will be of interest to architects and constructors rather than the general reader.  The text assumes a naval architect's background and vocabulary on the part of the reader. Mostly deals with capital ships in the Royal Navy.  Not enough detail on either the personalities of individuals behind the ships,  ship engagements during the period, or developments in the ships of the Royal Navy's competitor nations.  Interesting diagrams and photographs.	1997-10-20
