As an astrologer and psychic, I have often commented to my clients, \\"You think what I do is a mystery?  Economics is the biggest mystery of all!\\"<br /><br />I found this book one of the few books this year that really changed the way I look at things and think about things.<br /><br />For example, a recent immigrant from another country known to often pull my leg told me about cars being \\"automatically driven\\" down the highway here in San Diego a few years ago.  I thought he was making it up.  But it really happened.  Surowiecki explains they were testing traffic patterns.<br /><br />Surowiecki also cleared up a matter that had frustrated me -- the government's proposed futures market on terror attacks.  I knew when I heard about it would work because I'm intuitive.  But I never could have put it into words like Surowiecki did.<br /><br />This is a great, fun, readable book that makes economics more clear to the average person and it changed the way I think about the world around me, so I give it a big FIVE STARS.  Actually, I couldn't put it down!	2004-10-29

In retrospect I can't think of another book that raised my consciousness quite the way this one did.  As a female victim of childhood molestation, I have tried to understand sexuality from the male perspective and it was helpful to read a frank but intelligent and spiritual book by a man about men without intercession and without courtship to the feminine in the audience.  I often recommend this book to women who are genuinely interested in a better understanding of men and not just interested in getting them to put the toilet seat down.  If you're one of these more enlightened sister types, give the book a try.  It's one of a kind in my experience.  I also appreciate the Jungian approach to all matters in life and this book is part of a series of books, most of which I have read with interest and appreciation.	2004-09-28

Lopez, desperate for relief from pain following surgery that would not heal, sought the advice of a body-centered healer, who told her the only way he knew to relieve pain was by going deeper into it.  Reading, browsing and rereading Lopez' book takes us to the place where boundaries merge and the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual bodies are one.  Thus, it reminds us that WE are ONE and describes for us in poetry and metaphor, the mystical and ecstatic experience of atonement (at-one-ment) and healing.  The book is beautifully written and elegantly illustrated.  Like pain itself, it can become a companion to trust and walk with upon occasion for there is much to learn in these liminal lands.	2004-04-18

It is an intellecutally and aesthetically enriching experience from start to finish.  The author presents Durer in a full historical context, dramatically explaining his importance in time and place.  Many illustrations are included, the style is very readable, and the fascination of watching Durer emerge from the pages of the book and the mists of the Middle Ages in Germany, is just terrific!  You will learn more than you perhaps thought possible about Durer and you may also wonder, as I did, why I had not appreciated his art more.	2003-12-01

No less an authority than John Keegan has given this book his blessing, so don't be mislead by negative reviews.  This book is a classic in the field of military history.  No history is unbiased.  History is an art not a science.  And it is a great art.  It can move and inspire as well as instruct us about human nature.  Historical writers who can weave myth and symbolism in to their writing carry forward important ideas and concepts for the collective.  This is precisely what Creasy has done in his book, organizing his material around the idea that war is productive of something.  He influenced every writer of military history who followed. That in itself is enough to promote the book.  &quot;15 Decisive Battles&quot; is an excellent introduction to general military history, a perspective often missing in college history courses.  I read it many years ago and have since read many different treatments of these basic 15 battles.  Ultimately one picks one's preferred viewpoint.  Creasy is a generalist but for that very reason, this a good book to start with.  Incidentally, I challenge the reviewer who questions the description of the Battle of Teutoburger Wald.  I have read the Latin version in Latin and the German version in German and they are absolutely consistent with this British version.  I was quite amazed, so try it and see for yourself.  I love this book and I really want to recommend it to you.  I give it 5 stars and no, I am not queasy on Creasy.	2003-07-05

Churchill writes history the way I like to read it.  History is about people, ideas and concepts.  As the German metaphysical philosophers are so fond of suggesting, perhaps history is the outworking of God's Mind.  When I read this book I began to understand not just the evolution of the island race, which I have read about before -- the migration of the tribes across Europe -- but more importantly I began to understand the evolution of the English Parliamentary system.  This book describes the painfully slow and difficult process of hewing out those rights which we in America consider our &quot;entitlement&quot; and so often take foolishly for granted.  Furthermore, I grew to understand, as the great lawyer, Ray Garrett, Jr., once said, &quot;It is the law that makes organized life possible.&quot;  Winston Churchill had one of the greatest minds in history.  It is a thrill to share his intelligent reflections on history and culture.  This book is a must for your personal library.	2003-07-05

Since we are currently doomed to deal with this phenomenon 3 times a year, it pays to brush up on the meaning of Mercury Retrogrades and find as many positive ways to deal with it as possible.  I think astrologers will find Chrissie's book particularly handy because it has tables in the back for quick reference and it tells each Sun Sign how to survive!  You can even recommend it to your clients because it is so easy to navigate through and understand.  It is demanding work to write about Mercury Retrograde and I think Chrissie has done a great job!<br />.	2002-08-05

Still, you have to give it to anyone who would approach the ultimte irrational planet with the rational.  I found the book especially helpful for interpreting the way Neptune-ruled individuals fall desperately and hopelessly in love with an unattainable object ...  and with little hope of redemption.  Without this understanding, you might just think they were masochistic.  I recall a member of one of my classes who was ecstatic to have found his soul mate.  The rest of the class was curious to discover he had not seen her for over 10 years.  Well, read this book and find out why Neptunians don't need a body to fall in love.	2002-06-17

Therese Francis has written a really nifty little book about the plagues and promises of Mercury when he goes backward over his own tracks.  Remember the story of Mercury and the cattle of Apollo?  It's a funny story and it describes the true nature of this Rascal in the Skies.  It is very difficult to talk about Mercury since this planet rules your ability to talk in the first place and yet the yearly activities of Mercury are extremely important to a smooth running routine in life.  Francis manages to demystify the subject and to provide helpful, comprehensive tactics to get the best out of Mercury's mercurial behavior!  The book is easy to read, attractively printed and a great edition to a growing library of books on your favorite subject, astrology.  I would like to buy a couple hundred of these books and send them to all my clients.  That's how helpful it is to understand what's going on when Mercury goes retrograde.	2002-04-28

I have personally tested his material in the fires of life for 20 years with my astrology clients and I would swear by the information in this book.<br />Schulman also gives a very good description of what karma is -- and isn't.

Whoever you are, whatever you think about sex, you are not alone!<br />Understanding sexual energy is a must for advanced metaphysical students. Astrology gives this mysterious and powerful subject an understanding available from no other perspective.

You will discover, for example, how your sexual partners experience you during courtship and lovemaking, what you must learn sexually and what you are here to teach, the type of partner that is best for your development, and many other useful pieces of insight and information.<br />In order to get the most out of the book, you will want to have your own natal chart on hand and be able to interpret it. And in order to get the most out of the &lt;information&gt; in the book, you will want to have your partner's chart nearby as well!<br />Many of the ills of our society are a direct result of repressed and unhealthy sexual attitudes in America. A true understanding of the information in this book can go a long way toward healing this very dark corner of our culture.<br />&quot;The Astrology of Sexuality&quot;, like the other books in this series, will make a valuable edition to any astrologer's permanent reference library.	2001-09-04

She uses the Marseilles deck, which I think is a bit of a drawback, but the outstanding thing about the book is that she illustrates her points with information from Carl Jung, the great transcendentalist psychologist.  She paraphrases Jung and makes his commens easy to understand.<br />Nichols also includes examples from great literature, painting and sculture which support the points she is making.  This gives you some unforgettable visuals to associate with the cards.  This is turn makes it easier to remember their meanings.<br />Nichols' book deals only with the Major Arcana and it is definitely for the serious metaphysical Tarot student.  It wouldn't lend itself well to telling fortunes or anything like that and it does not deal with spreads.<br />I don't think Nichols is the most naturally talented writer in the world but it is obvious she has put a great deal of energy and, more importantly, LOVE, into her work.  I'd really recommend it ... get a used copy and put it in your permanent Tarot library.  It will provide some information you can't get elsewhere.	2001-09-04

Nietzsche explains the alchemy between the god Apollo and the god Dionysius which can be related to the eternal dialogue in the astrology chart between the male and female polarities.  Apollo, the Sun, the Solar God and Dionysius, the mysterious and undone god, well symbolized in the chart by the planet Neptune, approach the truth and the source of wisdom in diametrically opposed but mutually supportive manners.  This book is as alive today as it was when it was first published.

Fortune, the author of many classics in the metaphysical field, was among the first to speak out on this topic and it is worthwhile to read the book for this reason alone, if you are seriously interested in the development of thought in the metaphysical field. Fortune was briefly a member of The Order of the Golden Dawn until her feud with another important member broke her association.

Their names are legion because I am Plutonic myself and draw them to me.<br />I believe that the greatest fear of the Plutonic person is that they are alone in the dark.  I mean this symbolically and on every imaginable level.  If you are so young that you want to tell me this is an outmoded impression of Pluto, I will speak to you after your first couple of Pluto transits and God help you for your naivete.<br />After reading Greene's book you will understand yourself at an entirely different level and you will be able to contact the MEANING in what it is you are struggling with in your life.<br />It is extremely difficult to talk about Pluto and its effect in people's lives with any degree of clarity.  Greene shows depth, compassion, scope and breadth and, as always, her writing is TOP NOTCH.  Greene is my favorite writer in the field and I highly recommend all of her books.<br />Perhaps her own Scorpio Rising and Pluto in the 9th house are helpful in her endeavor here but I recommend the book without qualification as the premier book on this pesky planet.	2001-09-02

Hand is learned, profound, and sometimes downright uncanny in his interpretations. As I recall, he wrote this book in collaboration with Jayne, while Saturn was transitting his third house.

It is difficult to imagine how powerful this small book is. Granted, it is probably most appealing to intuitives and introverts, like myself, but for us, it is like manna from heaven. Johnson has such a gift for putting things simply. The book can be read quickly but may well take a lifetime to permeate your consciousness. As a professional astrologer, VisionCoach and expert Tarot symbolist, one of the most frequent questions I am asked by old and new clients is this: &quot;I had this dream, Nancy.  What does it mean?&quot; In spite of ongoing research on my part, personally leading dream groups and reading the new books that come out each year, I always return to Johnson's classic. He's said it all. I think &quot;Inner Work&quot; is, quite simply, the best book ever written about dream interpretation. Each of our dreams is as personal as our fingerprints. If you are an extravert, you may not dream often or you may dream the kind of dreams that are just processing the minute business of the day. At least once in awhile, though, even the most extraverted of us has a Major Dream, a dream that wakes us with a cold sweat or a warm pulse. What does this mean? What is communicating here? Why to you? And why NOW? Johnson's book puts all these questions squarely back on your own shoulders for answerung, for ... inner work!! But don't worry, he doesn't just drop you off in the middle of the nowhere without a map. This book contains all the information you need to become an expert at interpreting your own dreams.

As a professional astrologer, VisionCoach and expert Tarot symbolist, I find this book the single most profound reference of its kind. It has been my constant companion since I first read it back in 1989. I have since read it at least three times from cover to cover and I refer to it constantly in the classes I teach. Robert Wang has thoroughly mastered the material. He has access to the secret doctrines of the mystery schools such as The Order of the Golden Dawn. His approach is intellectually and practically balanced with a profound understanding of the spirituality and mystic wisdom of the Qabalah. This is a book that will stay with you at whatever level you meet it and meet you at whatever level you wish to take it to later.  Perhaps it goes without saying, but a good working knowledge of astrology and Tarot is a real plus before cracking the spine of this one!	2001-09-02

This is one of the points of this great new look at an age-old problem.  Families today are as different as individuals.  The astrology in this book does not look to shame or blame.  The object is to see what is and see what could be if perspective could change.  I like this positive approach because my family is far from a Rockwell idyll and frankly I'm tired of grousing around about it.  Sullivan uses classic interpretation techniques but applies them to groups of charts that cluster on the branches of the family tree.  She  also has some innovative ways of interpreting family dynamics that I feel are interesting though not conclusive.  I have had approximately the same amount of practical experience as Sullivan reading astrology charts (27 years in my case) and I do not feel her \\"conclusions\\" are conclusive!  They are certainly worth further exploration, however.  I would consider this a seminal work.  So, why not grab your Family Tree, shake down some of the those branches and see what all you little monkeys were about in incarnating together over a long period of time.  Sullivan is particularly  good with the Ancestors, by the way.  I think you will enjoy her approach to genealogy and heritage and find it empowering.  Give this good book a try.  But advanced astrologers only.	2001-09-02

It's a &quot;cookbook&quot; -- i.e., a crutch to use for beginning astrologers before they get this all permanently situated in their own brains. But for its purpose, it is absolutely divine. Hand is without equal in technical skill and, surprisingly, his interpretations are uncannily precise and on the mark, as if he were also psychic. He wrote these Planet Series books while Saturn was transitting his third house, no doubt giving him the discipline to achieve something so tedious yet important. I've always enjoyed learning in the simple, delightful way that children learn. This book is written to describe the effects of the signs, planets and houses in the birth charts of children, but I'll guarantee you, it fits every adult you've ever known as well. Perhaps we are all always Little Children trying to spell God, as Dion Fortune has said. I recommend this book, with a warm smile, to all my astrology students!	2001-09-02

I think it is a shame more women don't read this book.  I have been a student of military history for many years and I understand that in many ways, life is war.  This book, in such a beautiful new translation by James Cleary, teaches us excellent metaphysics in the most ancient of ways.  Learn how to nip your problems in the bud, like the doctor's &quot;famous eldest brother&quot;.  Read this quick, easy and user-friendly version of a classic theory of prevention that has stood the test of time.  And, please, tell a woman friend!!	2001-09-02

This book is like a blunt instrument, pounding home the real truth about life and spirituality/metaphysics like a steady heart beat one-two punch to your integrated right and left brain.  Dethlefsen is a gifted and profound thinker, well versed in the esoteric schools of thought.  He has an original approach to his subject.  His voice is strong and earnest.  His message is quite serious:  know your place in the universe and fulfill it, or you will be eliminated as all things in nature that do not serve their purpose.  This book had a profound effect on me, my spiritual growth and my professional metaphysical practice when I read it some 14 years ago!  Dethlefsen's style (perhaps because of translation) is somehow unforgettable.  Many of his phrases have rung in my ears all these years.  I heartily recommend this book to the earnest spiritual warrior.	2001-09-02

Unassuming in its title, it carefully hides in the traditional esoteric manner, some of the greatest wisdom you will ever encounter on the subject of what it means to really be a woman.  When I hear enthusiastic discussion about rights and entitlements and equality, I often think of the tale Dion Fortune tells of the beautiful, enthralling and mysteriously ageless woman who lives by the sea, the Sea Priestess.  This book is a written ritual.  It is sheer magic.  If you but read it and really understand it, and you are a woman, you will never, ever be the same.  This book is all about power.  It's the real thing.  Fortune is a seminal writer in the field of metaphysics whose name you should know and whose books you should read if you are serious about this field.	2001-09-02

Linda Goodman's Love Signs has been a classic in the field for decades, and for very good reason.  Her material is very helpful in guiding you through the maze of relationships and relationship building.  Reading about the different signs and their compatibilities can help you not only when you have fallen in love or met someone &quot;interesting&quot;, but it can also help when you are having problems or if you are trying to formulate what we know in the metaphysical field as a &quot;wish list&quot;.  When you learn more about the different signs and their capabilities and drawbacks in love, you will be able to refine your own taste and expectations.  If you are a beginner at love, you may not even realize that there are as many different ways to court and express love as there are signs (12).  Do you know what you are looking for?  Maybe there's something you want that you didn't even dare dream of.  Look in this book ... you may find it in one of the signs.  I recommend ordering this book today and keeping it by your bedside!  (There is also no better way to learn beginning astrology as with Linda Goodman.)	2001-09-02

Where else will you find a sympathetic book about the history of astrology written by a Senior Lecturer in Classics at the University of London?<br />I often use this book in my astrology classes to delve into the fascinating history of our favorite field.<br />Tester takes it from the very beginning -- the Greeks, not the Chaldeans as sometimes supposed -- and brings it right through the Middle Ages and the Age of Enlightenment.  Chances are you've never heard astrology talked about this way.  If you are a history buff, like me, it's just all that much more interesting.  It's history the way you never heard it taught, too.<br />Tester's work is scholarly but readable and I found the information just fascinating.	2001-09-02

It was the first user-friendly astrology text/book to really address the issue of retrogrades in an in-depth and thought-full manner.  Retrograde planets seem to turn around and go backward from our perspective on earth.  During their backwards transit, they encourage us to look at the &quot;under&quot; or &quot;other&quot; side of things, thus the title of my review.  We are all used to Mercury's retrograde three times a year, or we should be or at least have heard of it.  Sullivan's book doesn't stop there.  She considers the nature and mechanics of retrogression as it affects the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and the outer planets as well.  You will not find a more thorough or READABLE explanation of this important phenomena.  Sullivan also gives a good long chapter to retrograde natal planets and the secondary progression of retrograde planets or planets to retrograde.  Not the most exciting writer in the world, Sullivan is nonetheless, thorough, methodical, devoted to her work and readable enough.  I give this 5 stars not because the book is a real can't put downer, but rather because Sullivan is a meticulous astrologer who really knows her stuff.  &quot;Retrograde Planets&quot; should be considered a good intermediate reference volume for the budding professional astrology.	2001-09-02

I certainly don't mean the formula for interpreting each of the signs at the house cusp.  That's child's play.  I mean the pyschological function of the Rising Sign as a mask, its pivotal relationship to the 12th, 1st and 7th houses and its capacity to both attract and filter experiences from the outer world.  I have always found Jeanne Avery to be a very entertaining writer, but I think the thing I like most about her &quot;Rising Sign&quot; book is that by the time a student finishes it, ifthey read it cover to cover or least sequentially through each chapter of the people they are interestedin, they will have had a good, thorough walkthrough on how to interpret and tie together an entire chart using the house by house by house method that Avery exemplifies.  The glaring flaw in this book -- and I always wonder how it could have possibly been justified -- is that not only does it not take into account intercepted signs, it doesn't even mention that there is such a thing and that it could greatly affect a reading you give yourself or someone else using this book.	2001-09-02

Liz Greene Rules	Liz Greene has influenced my thinking more than any individual, astrologer or not. Her experience as a Jungian analyst, her Rising Sign in Scorpio, her Pluto in the 9th house, all give her the power and perspective to write as she does about this difficult area of astrology. If you have Pluto prominent in your chart, do yourself a favor and read this book. You will probably feel like, at last, someone understands you and the &quot;way it is&quot; for the Pluto Club. Greene gives unforgettable examples of case history from her astrological practice. Her writing is a marvel of craft, skill, and discipline, laced with some British-isms that seem charming to me. I place her at the top of writers in the field for her style and scope. What I like most about this book, however, is the profundity of her thoughts, the compassion so evident in her commentary and the healing insights which accompany her lucid descriptions of this dark planet through the signs, houses and lives of those discussed. I do not think you can adequately understand Pluto without absorbing this book. There is none other its equal in the present market.	2001-09-02

Jeanne Avery's book on astrological aspects is one of the very best books I've found that describes in REAL LANGUAGE what an aspect FEELS like.<br />Avery uses vivid and unforgettable examples from the lives of celebrities and people she knows or has read for. There is something about the way she relates these people describing their OWN feelings that sticks in your mind.<br />In my beginning days interpreting charts professionally (scarey! back in 85), I often relied on her descriptions of aspects to make my points with clients and invariably the clients were nothing less than astounded with the veracity. For the first time, I could really understand what it felt like to have Mars square Uranus when such a person in her book described it as a sugar high or a sugar addiction, the scratch that could never be itched, etc.<br />And I remember the Pluto Mars person in her book saying her son infuriated her so much that her husband had to hold her hands to her side to keep her from doing violence to him while she literally SHOOK WITH RAGE.<br />In my beginning practice, I actually had people break down in tears of gratitude when I used these analogies for them to help them understand the difficult energies they were dealing with -- they were so moved that FINALLY someone seemed to understand what they were going through.<br />It's a real shame this book didn't get reprinted because you can see that I found it quite invaluable. It takes awhile as a pro to build up enough case experience to have your own set of &quot;snapshots&quot; to use in illustrating aspects and Avery has some really, truly wonderful ones. Good illustrations of energy during a chart interpretation/reading build instant empathy with the client and that builds good rapport for anything important that is going to follow. It's part of the magic of astrology.<br />I would certainly recommend chasing this book down in the used section if you are considering a career in astrology.	2001-09-02

Well, what's not to love about the moon? &quot;Moon Signs&quot; really is a charming and special book. As an additional bonus, it crosses over nicely into the ritual area and can be of great value to Natural Magicians, Wiccans and others who need to be very tuned in to the moon and it cycles. The book is geared toward a general audience, though, and there are user-friendly tables and references that will help you find out what sign your own astrological Moon is in. Armed with this valuable information, you can then join the astrological &quot;crowd&quot; in finding out such things as emotional compatability, the meaning of the moon through the houses and things like that. The book also explores the moon's daily, and monthly path through the heavens. My favorite part of the book is the lists of affirmations appropriate for new and full moons in all 12 signs of the zodiac. I often call on thse affirmations for my own Moon Rituals, I find them so cogent and handy. The lunar approach of this book is a refreshing balance to the majority of solar texts on the astorlogical shelves in the bookstore and in my own personal library. It contributes very much just by being a &quot;different&quot; approach and it has a real charm to it besides. This is a good book to add to your collection.	2001-09-02

Nothing in this book could really be made up. Based on ancient Roman history, the twists and turns of the plot, the antics of the main characters, the beliefs and behavior of the Roman citizens, the irony of history, and the absolute impossibility of what is clearly happening right before your eyes will keep you turning the pages of this book so fast your head will spin. My favorite scene: when the mad Emperor dresses like the goddess Aurora and dances in dead earnest to bring in the dawn.  The scenes describing the Pythian oracle would be hard to match anywhere in world literature.  Just two of a hundred of the most amazing scenes you'll ever find in any book.  Graves has truly written a masterpiece.	2001-09-02
