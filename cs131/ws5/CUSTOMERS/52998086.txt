US	52998086	RLHIQN9LOFUBH	0684168693	780859026	The Night She Died	Books	3	7	8	N	N	Looking forward to more.	This is my first by Dorothy Simpson (although there are now more than a dozen in the series) but definitely a series worth pursuing.  The protagonist, Luke Thanet, is a no-nonsense, down-to-earth police officer.  He is an easy-going family man who methodically works his way through his cases until coming up with the end result by process of elimination. In this book, the murder of a young housewife may or may not be tied into another murder that took place over two decades before.  Simpson's descriptions of the English countryside, towns, and villages add so much to the story; you can almost picture being there.	2002-09-16

I think the thing that impressed me most about this book was the portrayal of psychologist, Alan Gregory, as a human first and a psychologist second.  White didn't even wait until his second or third book to have things go really wrong.  He heaped it all on Dr. Alan Gregory in this first book, thus successfully opening the door for us to build on the protagonist as a fallible human being with whom things can and do go wrong.  And when it rains, it pours.  Never mind the adage about things happening in three's--you can double that and just keep going with all the stuff happening to Dr. Gregory.  The best part was that although most things worked out in the end, it wasn't your typical happy ending with everything tied up in a neat package.  We were left pondering some things and also left knowing that the protagonist was going to need some time to mentally and emotionally recover from all that had happened.  I can't wait to read the second installment in this series.	2002-09-16

Paula Boyd makes her debut with funny, down-to-earth characters.  As for Jolene, rarely does she make a trip home to Kickapoo, Texas, without some catastrophic event taking place.  In this case, it happens to be that the local mayor has been murdered and her mother is on the suspect list.  To top it off, Jolene is the center of much gossip at the local Dairy Queen.  The personality of the protagonist reminds me a lot of Stephanie Plum of the Janet Evanovich novels, just without the gun.  Sharp, witty, and frustrated with her mother, Jolene swarms through each day trying to keep her mother out of trouble and out of jail.  Definitely a must read if you are looking for a quick and easy read that doesn't require a lot of sleuthing or thought.	2002-09-16

The main thing about this mystery is that it takes place back in the late 1800's when women in the workforce (especially one working as a private eye) was virtually unheard of.  After losing her child and her husband, Jasmine Malloy remained employed at the Selkirk Detective Agency.  Jasmine is asked by a wealthy family to locate their daughter who has run away.  The storyline was very straight forward and enjoyable without a lot of added fluff and minutae that a lot of authors use in order to make a story longer.  Though definitely not categorized as a thriller, or even particulary deep, the story maintained a steady, interesting beat, and I will definitely look for more by this author.	2002-07-09

In debt as far as they can go with no way out, Barry Lee and his wife, Lola, decide to stage the ultimate money-making scheme--Barry's death.  Lola is from Guerrera where record-keeping is sloppy at best.  With the help of Lola's family, friends (some not so friendly) and pseudo-strangers, Barry's death is staged.  However, word gets out, and some of Lola's not-so-smart cousins decide that if Lola is going to received hundreds of thousands of dollars from Barry's death, then he really should be dead. So while Lola is back in the states trying to settle the insurance claim, Barry is still in Guerrera trying to outwit and outrun Lola's cousins.  This fast-paced, suspenseful, and sometimes comical farce will keep you wondering how they are going to get out of this one and will keep you turning pages until the very end.	2002-07-09

Although I enjoyed the story and the characters, for somebody who just 'happens' upon a dead body and might even be categorized as an amateur sleuth, Hannah follows this case with the tenacity of a dog with a bone.  She asks questions and follows leads as though she's assigned to the case instead of someone who's just supposed to keep her ears open and pass along any information to her brother-in-law (who really IS assigned to the case).  Since moving back home, Hannah's reconnection with her family and the opening of her business, The Cookie Jar, are both wonderfully written, humorous, at at times exasperating.  This series has potential, but let's hope that the author scales back a little bit on Hannah's involvement in future cases.  For someone who has no law enforcement experience, she's just too involved to make it believable.	2002-07-09

More than ten years after walking out on her husband and two daughters, Nora Bridge is a famous talk show hostess that centers around family.  However, eventually, a reporter discovers her buried secret and splashes it all over the papers.  Nora's daughter Ruby is not doing well, either, as her career as a comedian is failing terribly.  When Nora is injured in a car accident, Ruby's older sister Carolyn asks Ruby if she can go home to take care of their mother while she convalesces.  What starts out as a plot by Ruby to use this time with her mother to write a tell-all expose, predictably turns into a situation which helps to right some of the wrongs.  However, along the way, Ruby also learns some secrets about her father's past; and is also caught up in a potential romance with a childhood friend who also resides on the island.  The author does a great job of interweaving all of these aspects into a story that turns out okay in the end, but still manages to avoid turning into a totally hokey sob story.	2002-06-18

He's wondering how he's going to make ends meet and continue on when a rich socialite walks into his office and tells him she wants him to defend her against a murder charge for which she is guilty.  From here, the author takes you on a roller-coaster ride of murder, deceit, and a government secret that has been kept buried for half a century.

This was a fun, quicky, easy read that can be done in practically one sitting.  Even though Juliet Applebaum has quit her job as a public defender in order the stay home with her daughter, Ruby,  (and is expecting her second child), she still can't seem to keep out of the work sector.  She is dissatisfied with being a stay-at-home mom, and wonders if that makes her a bad mother.  However, when the founder of the preschool in which they applied for Ruby is found dead, Juliet suspects murder and feels that familiar tug which sets her on a course to find out what really happened. This book will definitely not provide you with any heart-stopping chills or thrills, but is wonderfully quirky and makes a nice, light read.	2002-06-18

Kate's secret marriage to Wayne Caruso is advertised all over the place by a loud-mouthed reporter, and Kate is also being threatened by an animal rights group called Deer Count who think that Kate's group is out to kill off all the deer who have been mangling their gardens.  The only downside to this book is that you start out with a group of people so it is sometimes hard to organize your thoughts and remember who is who.  However, it is a great addition to the author's Kate Jasper series which includes just the right amount of murder, mayhem, and humor.	2002-06-18

It is so refreshing to have a law enforcement protagonist who isn't either a recovering alcoholic, a down-in-the dumps unshaven rumpled mess, or a philandering playboy.  As an employee of Scotland Yard, Gideon's slow, easy-going manner of doing things makes this series a bright change in reading.  In this book, Scotland Yard and local law enforcement districts must work together to round up nine inmates who have escaped from prison.  To add to the stress, a girl who went to school with Gideon's daughter comes to see him to say that her brother is being wrongfully charged in the murder of a local girl, and would he please look into it personally.  Despite the mayhem going on in the story, this was one of the most enjoyable, relaxing reads I have had in a long time and look forward to delving further into this series.	2002-06-18

I'm not sure exacty what the author was trying to portray in this book.  I didn't pick up on any particular train of thought where the protagonist, Carol Wilcox, was concerned.  At one point, I almost lost track of the cast of characters, there were so many; and there didn't seem to be any real connection between this girl and Carl that would make him go traipsing all over the place trying to solve her murder.  As for the murder storyline itself, it was somewhat adequate in keeping in line with the rest of the book.  Nothing to write home about, that's for sure.	2002-05-13

However, when Caitlin's best friend (who just happens to be Conner's brother) calls Mac and tells him that Caitlin is being stalked and has made an attempt on her life, he drops everything and comes to Manhattan to serve as her live-in bodyguard.  Sharon Sala takes you on a fantastic joyride including obsession, fear, anger, disdain, and even love.  Despite their disdain for each other, Caitlin and Mac find their feelings growing for each other all the while wondering when Caitlin's stalker will try and strike again.

Back from her haitus at Saint T's convent, China is trying to get back into the swing on things.  However, McQuaid is acting different, and China fears he is having an affair.  She overhears a phone conversation between McQuaid and a woman and confronts him about it.  McQuaid admits it is true, but that it is over. Also, unbeknownst to China, McQuaid is working undercover with the FBI regarding an issue with Texas Rangers.  While China is trying to sort out her feelings, McQuaid is shot while working undercover on his case.  We never really get to see how China would have worked things out because once she hears that McQuaid has been shot, everything else is immaterial.  Not only does she totally forgive McQuaid for his affair, but she befriends the woman with whom he had the affair (an FBI agent).  To top it off, she takes responsibility for the affair by saying that if she had said yes to McQuaid one of the many times he had asked her to marry him, he wouldn't have looked elsewhere.  No matter how much she loves McQuaid, I have trouble equating this simpering female with the headstrong,independent China from the previous books.	2002-05-06

As with most authors, Carol Benjamin writes about what she knows, and as a dog trainer, she knows dogs.  Unforfunately, she incorporates a little too much dog knowledge in this first novel.  Approximately 90% of the book revolves around dogs (training, showing, grooming, breeding, etc., etc., etc.).  Instead of being a mystery novel with a dog component, it reads more like a dog book with a murder thrown in as an aside.  Realizing that the main characters are PI Rachel Alexander and her pitbull, Dashiell, I know this series is going to have a dog component making it different from the majority of mystery series and giving it great potential.  Hopefully this author will tone down the dog information and beef up the mystery portion a little.	2002-04-30

Ironically enough, Jacobia's houseguest disappears without a trace, but then his mournful girlfriend and her uncle show up.  The main theme is whether or not there really is a vast treaure hidden somewhere by the original owner of Jacobia's house.

Wilhelm's style of writing is subtle and works its way under your skin when you're not looking.  It's not a hardcore mystery or psychological thriller, but Wilhelm draws you in so slowly and subtly that you don't even realize you're hooked.  When Abby's father, Jud, a bestselling novelist, is murdered in his lakeside cabin, Abby sets out to find out who the murderer is.  Others around Abby believe they know who it is, but the dawning realization takes Abby a little longer to accept.  Even better is Abby's father's ability to take actual events and people and change them just enough to use in his books.  And, of course, the identity of Jud's murderer is hidden in his final novel.  Definitely a wonderfully woven story with believable characters and events.	2002-04-30

This is the first book I have read by this author, and it seemed kind of discombobulated.  While trying to maintain some sort of steady storyline, it seemed the author wasn't content unless there was at least one stress point going at all times.  Whether it was Tess trying to cope with her husband's death; dealing with strange phone calls about some supposedly missing money; trying to protect her son; or trying to cope with her job, new boarder, her housekeeper's brother, or a variety of other stressors, there was no resting point at all during this book and no neat coming together of facts with which to finish the story.  Throughout the whole book, Tess Leland was constantly on the edge, nerves frazzled, ready for the tiniest little push to put her over the edge.  It was almost as if somebody took a jigsaw puzzle, threw it into the air (where it hovered for a while) and then at the end dropped to the floor with every piece in place.  That was the way this story read.	2002-04-30

This second book of Ms. Benjamin's was a huge improvement over her first book.  At least in this book, the main focus is Lisa's alleged suicide and not the actual dog component of the book.  However, as with the first book, I like the fact that Rachel throws herself into the case with tenacity.  However, I think Rachel's concept of 'walking in Lisa's shoes' by going so far as to stay at Lisa's apartment, wear Lisa's clothes and jewelry, and doing all the activities that Lisa did was a little over the top.  There's a big leap from putting yourself in somebody's place to completely taking over their life.  The people who were part of Lisa's life who are Rachel's prime suspects are all odd and quirky, but it leant more to the story when trying to figure out which one did it and why.	2002-04-30

China has decided to take a two-week retreat at St. T's convent in order to wind down from the busy holidays.  While there, she is asked to look into a series of fires.  This book is different from Albert's others in such that you don't really want to choose a suspect, because who wants to think that a nun, or anybody working at a convent, is behind all the trouble?  China also happens to run into a hunky ex-beau that she knew from her lawyer days.  China doesn't get much rest on this retreat, but she does catch the firebug.

As with the first three books in this series, I still ask myself how come somebody who owns a store seems to have so much time to run around doing other things.  But, getting beyond that, this has definitely been my favorite to date.  In this one, after finding the body of Rosemary Robbins (who ran the store a few doors down from China), China seems to feel she owes it to Rosemary to find out who killed her.  So once again, instead of letting the police do their job, she throws herself into the thick of things.  So, you've got one dead body, one person missing, McQuaid out of the country trying to track down said missing person, an ex-con McQuaid helped put away recently released and threatening to come after McQuaid's son Brian (who has been left in China's care while McQuaid is out of the country), and McQuaid's ex-wife suing for custody of Brian. All in all, a big improvement over her previous books, and a lot of stuff happening.  Of course, let's not forget the never-ending tidbits of knowledge regarding various herbs, which I think adds a pleasant side to each of these stories.	2002-03-18

It can a little difficult to follow sometimes, because Waterhouse jumps back and forth between Garner's past and present, a book Garner wrote about one of her father's clients (Garner's father is a well-known, well-respected lawyer), and two current storylines all being interwoven into one story.

Are these killings racially motivated or a personal vendetta?  Also on the scene is Lindsey's father with whom she hasn't spoken in over 20 years since he walked out on her mother.

The book is based on the issue of assisted suicide, and whether or not Graham Russo helped his father kill himself.  The medical examiner's official standing is that it is a homicide/suicide equivocal -- which means that it could be either, there is not way to tell, and no indicators to make him lean one way or the other. This book addresses one of the medical issues that is at the forefront of today's society, but it does it in a way that is subtle and not in your face.  Throughout the book, Graham Russo maintains his innocence, thus sending Hardy on a search for the truth leading him to unearth a secret almost twenty years old.	2002-03-11

As usual, the author leaves many avenues open for exploration and it takes a good amount of deductive reasoning to figure out how and why Matthew was killed.  If you don't want a lot of trivial information clouding up your mind, this is not the book for you.  But, if you're looking for a book that points out the differences of social classes in a private school, and how those differences lead to murder, this is right up your alley.	2002-03-11

Although this is a soft-boiled, fun series, I find that the protagonist is too self-centered and whiny.  The fact that she is the only person who believes that her ex-brother-in-law, Wade, is innocent of two murders goes a little ways in redeeming her, but not far.  As for the rest of the characters, I always enjoy books like this with large families that are close and stick together to help their own.  The festitives are fun, the characters are wonderful, and this book hits the ground running and doesn't stop - despite the fact that two young people were murdered, and Benni puts herself right in the middle of finding out who did it.	2002-03-11

Robert Goddard is an exceptional writer who has the ability to make you question the things in which you may or may not believe.  His only downfall here was that he almost made the cast of characters too large to keep track of, especially when one of them keeps using different names.  However, his description of Eris Moberly's/Marian Esguard's fugue states and forays into the past is so believable you can almost conceptualize being there.  The characters and events are so intricately woven you sometimes can't tell where one ends and another begins.  Definitely not a fast-paced thriller, but a book to be read slowly and savored right to the last page.	2002-02-18

When Melanie Stokes starts having flashbacks and visions of the first eight years of her life (which she has suppressed), a twenty-year old secret will come to light.  All through this book, the author makes you search every lead, every angle, and every conceivable possibility as to what the truth may be behind a twenty-five year old murder, and a twenty-year old secret.  The twists and turns in this book read like a road map of curvy mountain roads, and the final outcome will shock you if you haven't been able to figure it out on your own.  This is a very fast-paced, suspenseful read that you don't want to start unless to you have the time to stick with it.	2002-02-18

My favorite part of this book was the wonderfully small cast of characters, each so different but all connected in one way or another.  The book had a slow start, but doesn't take more than the first chapter to pick up and take you on your way.  It was enjoyable, suspenseful, and as always had that irresistable wave of romance to it.	2002-02-18

After reading this book I would swear off Beaton forever if it weren't for the fact so many people seem to enjoy them.  This was my first shot at an Agatha Raisin book, and it was terrible.  The cast of characters was unbelievable.  Agatha follows her ex-fiancee to Cyprus.  She follows him around moon-eyed and sulky because he doesn't receive her with open arms.  She spends the whole book acting like an attention-starved puppy.  James treats her badly, insults her, belittles her and she still goes back for more stomping around and getting angry when he doesn't fall at her feet.  As for the actual mystery, it was a little more plausible, but still took way too long to solve.  The book could have been much shorter and still gotten the point across.  I hope her other Agatha Raisin books are better than this one.	2002-02-18

Charlie Greene's mother is the prime suspect in the murder of her next door neighbor, and there are more murders to follow.  The actual storyline wasn't very captivating, but the big cast of characters kept your brain turning.  The major downside to this book was that this was Charlie's first visit home to Boulder since she left sixteen years ago as a pregnant teen.  The mystery of who fathered Charlie's daughter, Libby, almost took top billing over what was supposed to be the actual mystery.  The book was okay--it makes for a light weekend read.	2002-02-04

Patterson's last couple of books have definitely not been up to the standards he set at the beginning of his Alex Cross series. At the end of his last book, Roses Are Red, Patterson reveals who The Mastermind is, thus leaving us hanging only in the area of how long it will take Cross to figure it out in Violets are Blue.  Throughout Violets are Blue, there is never any indication that Cross even has an inkling as to who The Mastermind is--no little suspicions, clues, or niggling feelings leading up to his mind-boggling realization that it is none other than his close and trusted friends of many years.  The fact that Cross never even suspected the man, and then suddenly figures out who it is totally ruins any credibility that the storyline might have maintained leftover from Roses are Red. Couple this with the main storyline that people are being murdered by vampires and wild cats and you've got yourself a disappointing read, espcially if you have followed Patterson from his first Cross book all the way through--somewhere along the way he detoured.  Let's hope he finds his way back to the quality of books we know he is capable of writing.	2002-02-04

Three years after the blast that killed her partner and lover and left her physically and emotionally scarred, Carol is assigned as lead investigator in a bomb explosion that had killed yet another officer, Charles Riggio.  When a federal agent shows up asking questions, Carol is convinced that the case is going to be taken away from her.  This makes Carol even angrier, and spurs her to continue her investigation no matter what.  Demolition Angel is fast-paced, always moving, and always someting happening.  There seems to be no down time at all during this book.  It was a little unrealistic in the sense that Carol lives on gin, cigarettes, and tagamet - I think throughout the whole book she actually only ate maybe two or three times, but the characters are believable.  I hope Robert Crais decides to continue using Carol Starkey as another series.	2002-02-04

This is my first by Genevieve Lyons, and I really enjoyed it.  The protagonist, Mark Dangerfield owns a bookstore which his girlfriend, Mandy, helps run.  In this novel, Mark is asked to look into the apparent suicide of Alison Alyward.  The police have closed the case as a suicide, but a family friend is convinced that she would never commit suicide.  Alison hangs out with three other friends that people refer to as the Fab Four.  When other members of the group start dying, Mark is certain there is something to be uncovered.  During the course of his investigation, Mark is stabbed and then later on has the stuffing beat out of him.  As opposed to protagonists who take a licking and just keep going, it was a little more realistic as his wounds managed to keep him down for a few days. Definitely a refreshing change; I'm planning on reading more in this series.	2002-01-15

The main premise of this story is that of a young wife whose husband goes off to war, leaving her alone in Hawke's Cove at her grandmother's house where she spent her childhood summers and has inherited.  Her husband is reported MIA, a handsome man (Joe Green) shows up out of nowhere and incorporates himself into her life, and then she gets news that her husband has been found and is on his way home.  She leaves the island and returns to her home in Boston and doesn't return to the island until 50 years later to attend her son's wedding.  Throughout this time, Vangie and Joe keep in touch via letters, but have no contact other than that.  Although fifty years have passed and Vangie and Joe have led their own lives, their love for each other has endured.  The author also offers other people's perspectives throughout the story, which adds to the intensity of the story.  I would highly recommend this book for anybody who likes a nice, simple, down-home type of read.	2002-01-11

When Sunny Batten received the phone call that her mother and her mother's fiancee, Miles Finn, were found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning due to a faulty furnace, Sunny returns to King George, the small town where she grew up.  At the funeral, she meets Mile's son, who takes one look at her and claims that they have to be related because they have the same fine, fly-away hair with gray flecks in it.  That just about sums up the book.  From there, it's like the author didn't know in which direction to take them, so they just kind of drifted along day to day accepting this new knowledge and trying to figure out where to go from there.  It was a very low-key, nondescript story with no particular aim to it.	2002-01-11

When Theo Buchanan falls for the beautiful surgeon (Michelle 'Mike' Renard) who performed his emergency appendectomy, he finds himself taking a break from his job as a federal prosecutor and ends up in a small Louisiana town called Bowen. Needless to say, things just snowball from there.  I thought it was a wonderful cast of characters and will definitely follow-up with some of Garwood's other books.	2001-12-27

When Flip Balfour disappears, the pressure is on to find out what happened to her.  Flip is the daughter of a prominent London banker, so as with any high profile case, the police are under intense scrutiny, and there are many leads to follow.  Add to this a tiny wooden coffin containing a doll found in a place called The Falls.  The author started up several different storylines and never tied them together. The different storylines contained the same cast of characters, but there didn't seem to be any particular order or focus to the story.  I found all the characters very dreary (including the protagonist and his comrades), which made for a very hard to read book.  I've heard good things about this series, so if you haven't read any of the previous book in the series, I wouldn't suggest starting with this one.	2001-12-27

When Emily Graham decides to leave the big city, she purchases her ancestral home in Spring Lake, and along with it some long-buried secrets.  Emily is still emotionally and mentally recuperating from being stalked, although her stalker has been captured and jailed, or has he?  Somebody is watching Emily, taking pictures of her, and leaving them for her to find.  To add to her troubles, the day she closes on her house, two bodies are discovered buried in her back yard.  Over a century ago, three young women in Spring Lake disappeared without a trace (one of them being Madeline Shapley, sister of Emily's great-great-grandmother), and it would seem as though history is repeating itself when women start disappearing on the exact dates as the girls did over one hundred years before.  The author does a wonderful job of taking us from one scene to another without being confusing, and keeps the reader guessing as to who might be after Emily now while throwing in some surprising plot twists.  Definitely a must read for fans of Mary Higgins Clark.	2001-12-27

Sara Deane and her aunt Julia find themselves filling in a couple of vacancies on a European garden tour when the tour leader ends up taking a tumble down her cellar stairs and can't go.  Then, Ellen Travino, a colleague of Sara's and the botanical 'specialist' who is also supposed to go, ends up missing and presumed dead. Everybody in the tour group is under suspicion, and Sara puts herself right in the middle of everything.

In this story, Stone Barrington is walking home one night when famous new anchor Sasha Nijinsky takes a 12-story dive from her balcony to land on a pile of dirt right in front of Barrington.  Assuming that she is dead and that it wasn't an accident, Stone rushes into her building to her floor to try and catch the pusher before he/she can escape.  In the interim, while being transported to the hospital, Sasha's ambulance is in an accident, and she disappears.  Not knowing whether or not she is dead or alive, Stone and his partner follow up the investigation as a missing person/homicide.  As the case unfolds, Stone is faced with a moral dilemma and a decision which ultimately is made for him.

This third book finds Conrad Voort tracking a list of names given to him by a childhood friend, Meechum Keefe.  As Conrad tracks down these people he finds that so far all but one is dead.  In digging a little deeper, Voort finds himself the target of some very dangerous and unsavory characters.  This particular book didn't hold as much interest for me as his first two because it was focused largely on military/government, but as far as the actual storyline and plot, it was a little more intricate than Black's other books and very well written.  Black is proving to be a top-notch novelist. I will definitely continue to read books by this author.	2001-12-11

Margaret Maron is a witty and humorous writer and has done a great job with this first book in the Deborah Knott series.  In this the first book we find out that Deborah is the youngest child, and only girl, in a very large family. Many mentions are made of her numerous brothers (but it isn't until the fourth book in the series that we actually find out how many brothers she has).  Deborah currently resides with her Aunt Zel and Uncle Ash.  She is asked to solve an 18-year-old murder by the murdered woman's daughter (who was just an infant at the time of the murder).  Digging into this leads to two more murders in an attempt to cover up the original.  The only downside can be trying to keep track of family members and whose kids are whose, etc. (if those types of details matter to you).  Definitely a book worth reading.	2001-12-11

In this fourth book of this series, we finally find out how many brothers Deborah has (11).  Her large family of older brothers has been mentioned in previous books, but until now we were never told exactly how many.  As for the mystery plot in this book, it is tenuous at best.  If you are not paying close attention, you could be left with a lot of questions regarding motive.  The main story with this book is that a developer is looking to get his hands on the property that Deborah, her father, and her brothers own (collectively approximately 2500 acres) as well as the surrounding properties owned by neighbors.  One of Deborah's brothers (who lives in California) has lost his job and is condering selling his small parcel (3 acres) to the developer.  The major difference with this book is that is doesn't have the 'light' humor that Maron has put into her previous books.   Still, the author is maintaining a steady pace with the series.	2001-12-11

The author introduces us to Conrad Voort, a police officer who comes from a long family line of law enforcement officers, and who also just happens to be the 'richest cop in New York'.  Although Voort's personal relationship has just hit the skids, work must continue.  He and his partner (who is also wealthy) must track down a killer who is leaving the initials BHC at each of the murder scenes.  About half way through the book, the author throws in a wonderful twist as to the identity of the members of the Broken Hearts Club.  The only real downside to this book is the author's continuing references regarding Voort's wealth in places where it isn't relevant to the storyline.  When the author does this, it detracts from the storyline and the fact Voort is excellent cop with a sharp mind.	2001-11-28

This novel was wonderfully woven to reveal only a little bit of information at a time (alternating back and forth from past to present).  It is very easy to start right out thinking that this is another run of the mill story about a girl who was obviously, in one manner or another, sexually abused as a child or teenager and is now going around killing men as a result, but it's not that predictable.  The aforementioned abuse is correct, but beyond that, nothing about this book is predictable.  From the catalyst that starts her on her killing spree, to how she comes to choose the names of men on her list who she feels have to die, the author has thrown in some surprises and plot twists that make this book a refreshing change from many in this genre.	2001-11-28

Although this is the second book in this series, it is the first by this author that I have read, and I enjoyed this book immensely.  I'm not sure what it was that made it different than other books of this genre, but it was.  In this novel, Deborah Knott (who is the only girl in a large family of boys) is sworn in as a judge, her brother is poisoned, her neice is assaulted, and neighborhood dogs are disappearing.  We follow her through her days in court as well as her personal life, family life, etc.  She is realistic, down-to-earth, and very easy to like.  The author does a great job of making Deborah a part of the story without singling her out as the protagonist.  It's almost as if all the characters in the book get equal billing, making it all the more believable.  The parts I liked best is whenever Deborah has a thought that may or may not be correct or might be a moral dilemma of some kind, there is an argument in her head between two voices--the preacher and the pragmatist--but are not overdone and are usually only a sentence or two.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a series that is light, yet believable, with likable characters.	2001-10-31

It was okay, but I found it hard to follow.  There were a lot of characters, and it took me about half way through the book until I was comfortable enough to know who they all were without having to stop and think.  The storyline itself was somewhat unsatisfying.  It seemed as though the police were running around hodge-podge questioning and requestioning people with no specific strategy or reasoning in mind.  It was very confusing. It didn't have the organization that most police procedurals have.	2001-10-30

The story was good in that I appreciated Pete's tenacity in tracking down Noam (although I wonder if he would have put quite that much effort into it if it had not been 'family') per se.  Also, in this one, Peter comes face to face with his birth mother and his half siblings, nieces, nephews, etc.  The disappointing part was the beginning.  When the third book ended, we knew that Peter and Rina had become engaged, but nothing more had been said about it. As this book begins, they are on their honeymoon in New York.  I was flabbergasted.  The series' basis of the Decker/Lazarus relationship has been tenuous at best up until this point.  Then, to start this book and realize the Kellerman just skipped what could have been another whole storyline just blew me away. The absence of wedding plans, weeks leading up to the wedding, and the wedding itself left a great big empty hole in this series.  I think that if the two main protagonists were Decker and his partner the series would be alright, but Kellerman's attempt at making the Decker/Lazarus relationship part of the main storyline instead of a secondary storyline really brings down this series.	2001-10-22

In this the third in the series, Rina is in New York considering Peter's marriage proposal.  As with her first two books, I find Kellerman's portrayal of Jewish rituals wonderful and informative. However, as far as Peter's conversion to Judaism - he can't just do it for somebody else, he has to want to do it for himself -- and I just don't get the feeling that he is 100% into it, even though she does end up accepting his proposal. As far as Peter's case, in his effort to find the parents of a two-year-old girl that he found wandering the streets in the middle of the night, he stumbles across a quadruple murder.  The author made it very easy not to have any sympathy for any of the homicide victims.  The book is well written, but unfortunately trying to follow Decker's work life and trying to follow Decker's personal life is like reading two separate books.  The storylines are running parallel to each other, and the two just don't mesh.	2001-10-19

Although this book was better than the first one in the series, it still leaves a lot to be desired.  In this book, Peter is camping with Rina's two boys when one of the boys comes across two skeletons out in the woods.  This leads Peter on a journey into the world of prostitution and pornography in order to find out the identity of the two bodies and the motive behind their murders.  The actual mystery part of the book is good, but the developing storyline between Peter and Rina is still quite flat.  Although, in the book, their relationship is progressing forward (sometimes very slowly), and Peter is working toward converting to the Jewish faith, I don't think the author does a particularly good job of conveying the feelings that these two supposedly have for each other.  This series has a lot of potential, but so far these first two books have left me disappointed.	2001-10-19

In this first in the series, Peter Decker is called to handle the rape of a woman inside a Jewish complex.  Although I enjoyed the informative part of the book which dealt with the mikvah and the other rituals of the Orthodox Jews, the character of Peter Decker seemed one-dimensional and wooden.  The attraction between Peter (and outsider) and Rina is an interesting twist when you condsider that Peter was given up for adoption and raised in a Baptist family although his birth mother is Jewish. However, Peter's and Rina's growing attraction for each other creates an interesting storyline, and hopefully the author will be able to develop this character (Decker) into someone who isn't quite so one-dimensional.	2001-10-18
US	52998086	RKNX8FWD9NL55	0374117349	756714989	The Burden of Proof	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Not bad.	Although the book wasn't as enjoyable as some, it wasn't bad. The main character, Sandy Stern, is likable enough and still naive in many ways of the world.  While trying to hunt down the reason behinds his wife's suicide, his brother-in-law comes to him for help in straightening out some financial trouble that he has gotten himself into.  However, unless you are into finance, the market, and other areas such as these, most of the book will be dry and hard to get through.  It was for me.  The thing that kept me going was Sandy's continuing search to find out what was going on with his wife.  As I said, the book didn't exactly have me glued to it, but it wasn't bad, either.	2001-10-09

As with all of the Stephanie Plum novels, this is a quick, easy read.  There were parts that were hilariously funny, and some that made you wonder.  However, there wasn't much about it to distinguish it from the others.  You've got the same characters acting the same way and doing the same thing.  It's still a good series, but could use some fresh blood injected into it along with a few new ideas and characters for some variation.	2001-10-01

Even though there is the threat of war, things seem to be much simpler--people a lot more laid back.  Although the book itself was a nice, quiet read, I didn't care much for Lottie.  Although she was supposedly one of the main characters, I enjoyed the book more when I placed her in the setting of a secondary character and stopped focusing on when and where she was going to fit into the storyline.	2001-10-01

This book had a wonderful storyline which leads a young woman on a journey to find the father that abandoned her before she was born.  Patrizia is a young girl in her 20's whose mother has just died, and who has never known her father.  After her mother's death, Patrizia's godmother tells her the truth -- that her father abandoned her mother when she refused to get an abortion, thus sending Patrizia on a mission to Italy to track down her real father.  Patrizia manages to track down her father, but doesn't tell him right away who she is.  The storyline opens up and allows Patrizia to do what she really loves to do -- paint.  Coming to terms with her father also allows Patrizia to get on with her life, including a man she met and fell in love with while in Italy.	2001-10-01

When this book started out, I thought it had great potential for a nice cozy mystery.  However, I found it slow moving--it just didn't have any pick-me-up to it.  I felt like we were jumping back and forth from Vinnie's professional life to her personal life, and the two just didn't mesh.  For me, the characters and the storyline just didn't come together.  It felt like something was missing, although I can't put my finger on excactly what.  This is my first shot at Kate Gallison, and I might try another at some point in the future, but not right away.	2001-09-18

This book started out slowly enough, but soon picked up speed and kept right on going.  From one page to the next, it seemed as though Claire was on the run and never stopped.  From hiding the painting, to altering her appearance to help hide herself, the author did a good job of keeping you hanging as to who was going to find Claire and when.  Claire's occupation as a clerk in the vanity plates division of Motor Vehicle was another plus; and the information given on the various painters and their techniques was interesting.	2001-09-18

I think the part of this book that hooked me was Honoria's energy towards everybody around her.  In a time when many people still looked at black people and assumed they were nothing more than hired help, Honoria hired May as her personal assistant and treated her as an equal from day one.  When the son of Honoria's best friend comes to her for help (wanting to prove that his fiancee was murdered, and didn't commit suicide) she reluctantly agrees to ask around and see what she can find.  Toss in her loyal housekeeper, Mick (her Russian lover who everybody thinks is her husband), and a smattering of other characters and you've got a great story.  Aside from the actual story, I liked the fact that the author kept the number of characters minimal so that you didn't have any trouble following who was whom.	2001-09-10

Being interested in quilting myself, I like the way the author made quilting a major part of the storyline and not just a sideline item.  However, it doesn't detract from the actual story which was also a pleasant read.  After moving to a new town in Pennsylvania so her husband can start his new job, Sarah finds herself in a new place without a job or friends.  While hunting for a new job, Sarah befriends Mrs. Compson, the widow at Elm Creek Manor where her Sarah's husband's landscaping firm has been hired to landscape the grounds to their former beauty in order to ready the manor for sale.  While looking for work, Sarah agrees to help Mrs. Compson clean out the inside of the manor in exchange for Mrs. Compson teaching Sarah how to quilt.  In this manner, the two women form a bond that aids them both in putting aside their differences and also putting to rest some issues from the past.  I am looking forward to continuing with this series.	2001-09-10

I'm sure words such as touching, poignant, etc., have been used to describe this book, and in many ways it was.  However, here is a man who continues to be upbeat, cheerful, maintain a positive attitude towards life and people, and spout many little philosophical tidbits all while his health is deteriorating rapidly day by day because of Lou Gehrig's disease.  Personally, I have a hard time grasping how somebody can maintain such a positive attitude in the face of a debilitating illness such as this, but I'm glad I read the book.  This story has the ability to teach people some valuable lessons if they are willing to learn them.	2001-09-10

I don't have the first five books in this series, so I started with this one.  I have to say, I was hooked.  I enjoyed Burke's insights into and references to Dave's past.  Dave's new partner, Rosie Gomez, was standup, and Dave's 'visions' and continuing dialogue with a dead confederate soldier is what really held my attention.  This is a definite must read, and I hope the other books in this series are as good.	2001-09-05

Althought this is the first in her Kate Fansler series, it is the second that I have read.  If I had read this book first, I probably would not be inclined to continue with this series.  I felt like I was just dropped into the middle of a cast of characters without being properly introduced to them and what their roles are (history, etc.).  The one thing that seems to be consistent is Cross' habit of long sentences infused with prepositional phrases and lots of words like however, therefore, etc.  I realize the protagonist is an English professor, and I don't have any problem understanding the sentences, but I find myself getting impatient having to wade through all that excess just to get to the point of a sentence.  (Luckily the only time the reader has to deal with that is when Kate is talking.)  At this point, I have to say this series is not a high priority on my reading list.	2001-09-05

I enjoyed most the historic aspect of this story, the details of a time gone by. I found the cast of characters likable enough, and I like the author's choice of using a famous historical figure as a protagonist. In this book, Ben Franklin embarks upon a trip to Bath, England, running into some shady characters along the way. At one point or another along the way, you are led to question the integrity of almost all the people involved leaving you, the reader, to figure out who the good guys are and who the bad guys are.  Definitely a good read if you want to become absorbed in a good book, but don't want anything too heavy.	2001-09-05

Normally a mystery fan, I don't know what prompted me to purchase this book, but I'm glad I did. It was one of my first tries at fantasy, and it was totally enjoyable. The main character, Matt, is able to communicate with inanimate objects. She meets a guy named Edmund who happens to be a witch. They travel together to Edmnund's hometown and then leave there to find one of Edmund's childhood friends in order to put to rest something that happened when they were teenagers. I liked the storyline and the characters, and Matt's ability to communicate with inanimate objects was enjoyable. I will definitely try another of her books.	2001-08-31

This book had much stronger possibilities than the previous book in this series. However, I think too much emphasis is put on Alex's tight-knit circle of friends and all of the various little tidbits of her life. Although she makes a good living herself, she comes from money and has the tastes to prove it--from her uptown apartment to her designer suits and shoes. Too much time and emphasis is spent on pointing out her favorite designers, etc. The part of the book that actually deals with the murder is good, though. Dr. Dogen is a self-sufficent person who keeps to herself. It is up to Alex and the police to ferret out fact from fiction in order to find her killer. Despite the surprise ending, it was also something of a letdown, but it was still a worthwhile read.	2001-08-28

Billy's fears and anxieties are almost palpable as you follow Billy through his life at home and, subsequently, his life on the streets after running away from home.  Here is a smart, sensitive, 12-year-old boy who runs away from home to escape his mother's abusive boyfriend, only to find himself living on the streets and a witness to murder.  What follows is a race to see who can find Billy first.  The police, who want to protect him; his mother's boyfriend, who wants to turn him in for the money; and the killer, who wants to elimiate him.  Definitely a must read.	2001-08-21

This was the first suspense novel I have read by Catherine Coulter, and I will definitely try more.  Besides the main storyline, there were two or three sub-storylines going on, and the author managed to weave them all in without a hitch.  When Becca is accused by the police of inventing her 'stalker', she runs away to a small Maine coastal town hoping for some solace.  But the stalker finds her there, and the phone calls and threats start again.  Enter Adam Carruthers, who introduces himself to Becca as her 'guardian angel'.  He says he is there to protect her, but won't tell her who has sent him or why.  Soon, even more FBI agents are assigned to protect her.  What follows is a race between Maine and New York to find a killer who is both smart and resourceful, and a confused and bewildered Becca trying to find out why the killer is after her and also trying to figure out who she is and who she knows that would warrant the kind of manpower that has been dispatched to protect her.	2001-08-21

Laura Walsh, an up and coming producer for a major magazine, is working on an article regarding the now defunct Palisades Amusement Park.  When digging commences for the new high-rise building that will take its place, the skeleton of a boy who disappeared 30 years ago is discovered.  As Laura continues to try and get information on the Park, she begins to suspect that her father (who ran one of the rides at the park) may have been involved.  There are a few surprise twists and turns throughout the story which make this a nice, light suspenseful read which will most likely hold your attention.	2001-08-21

There was just something about Harley, working two jobs to support his three younger sisters after their mother was convicted of murdering their father, and the ensuing events.  There's no one thing that held my attention, but I'm glad I took the time to read it.	2001-08-13

Although the book wasn't too bad, it didn't seem to flow very smoothly.  The storyline seemed choppy and the characters didn't seem to mesh.  The premise for the story was good, but the style of writing did not make for a real page turner.  The series of events which led up to Valentine Phipps having possession of the 'item of value' was interesting, and gives us a glimpse into history of how people came to hide items of value during wartime.	2001-08-07

Ms. Howard did a great job of interweaving the serious with the humorous, balancing the growing attraction between Jaine and Sam with the need to find a psychotic killer who is stalking the four women.  All in all, I really enjoyed this book.	2001-07-26

I find her characters so endearing, and she almost always manages to bring together a raggle-taggle group of people to form a coherent, friendly crowd.  In this story, the characters experience a wide range of feelings -- lonelines, mourning, excitement, apprehension -- and end up coming together for the holidays in a small house in a village.  It's not necessarily the way the story ends, it the way she weaves the story and makes her characters so likable that does it for me.  Of all the books she has written, this is my third favorite (next to The Shell Seekers and September).	2001-07-24

Willard Scott, along with Bill Crider, does a wonderful job of giving us that small town feeling.  I enjoyed this book immensely (as I did the first one).  It is an enjoyable series, and I really liked the idea of a battle reenactment.  Willard Scott does an admirable job of modeling Stanley Waters after himself, faults and all.  I would highly recommend this book for anyone who would like a nice, light weekend read.	2001-07-24

The characters were down-to-earth and believable.  It wasn't your rough-em-up, shoot-em-up novel that is so typical of some of today's authors.  Sam Wright is an average, everyday working man, minus the tough-talking self congratulatory conceitedness that you find in many fictional protagonists.  The author carried this story from beginning to end, finely weaving all the details of the story and bringing them together wonderfully.  Nothing about this book was overstated or overdone.  I hope Clausen continues to write more in the same manner as this one.	2001-07-18

The character of Luella is a nagging witch who constantly gets pissed at Jake because he doesn't act or respond to her the way she would like him to.  Ten years after losing his wife, Jake is a quiet, reserved man still in mourning, and Luella is always screaming at him to let go of the past (not exactly an endearing character you want to relate to).  I reluctantly finished the book just to see how it would end. Maybe some people can dig enough to find a deeper meaning to this book, but to me it is just what it seems on the surface--a novel about insurance fraud.	2001-07-16

China is off on another investigation, this time trying to free her friend and animal rights activist, Dr. Riddle, from a murder charge.  China owns an herb shop, but can always seem to find someone to 'mind the store' anytime of day whenever she needs to go nosing around on a case.  This is the third in the series, and I'm not seeing any character development at all.

After being transferred out of the Organized Crime Unit and put back in uniform and teamed with his cousin, Nick, Eddie North is torn between doing his duty as a cop or protecting Nick, who seems to be straying from the straight and narrow.

Although China has good intentions and plans to stay out of it, she is drawn in and ends up right in the middle of everything.  The characters are fun, some are wacky, but they all serve a purpose in the overall story.  I also enjoy the author's in-depth information regarding herbs and their uses, and the insight into the Wiccan religion.  The continuing storyline between China and her boyfriend, McQuaid (an ex-cop) also keeps us wondering what is going to happen next.	2001-07-06

Throughout all this, he must continuously guard his own children, lest they be next.  High praise for James Patterson.	2001-02-05

In this riveting second installment of the series, Alex Cross is pitted against not one, but two macabre killers.  This one is brought especially close to home when Alex's niece is abducted.  It is a race against time as Alex tries to locate his niece and the other girls who have seemingly disappeared off the face of the earth.	2001-02-05

In almost every book we have had at least two killers (usually working together), and Alex being pulled in every direction trying to hold life, family, and job together.  This book begins with the appearance of a previous killer and adds a new one called the Mastermind.  For some reason, this book did not hold the fascination for me that the others did.  Also add in the fact that Alex's fiancee has decided that she needs to move away from Washington to get away from everything.  The surprising twist is that we do find out at the end of this book who the Mastermind is.  I think Patterson needs to take the storyline in a new direction, but all in all it was still a good read.	2001-02-05

This is the first installment in James Patterson's Alex Cross series, and it left me wanting more.  This author has the capability of combining psychological suspense with the horror of the unspeakable acts that some people are capable of committing.  In order to find this killer, Alex Cross must try and think like the killer does, thus taking you on a journey through the warped mind of a psychopath.  This was the first James Patterson I have read, but I will definitely keep reading this series.	2001-02-05

The idea for the storyline was good, but other than that, the book was terrible.  You basically have a group of well-to-do people who are not satisfied with what they have and constantly whine and complain about it.  The children acted more like adults than the adults did.

Lynn Kurland put just the right amount of humor and sarcasm into this book which kept it from being your typical romance novel.  It was clever and fun and just plain funny.  As the last surviving member of her bloodline, Genevieve inherits a castle.  She is told that the castle has a couple of 'quirks', but is not informed that it has a ghost.  This leads to a humorous beginning, and thus sets the basis for a wonderful and funny spin on what would otherwise be just another romance novel.	2001-01-14

I felt like I was slogging through mud going nowhere fast hoping that the book would pick up pace, but it didn't seem to.  I think it was mainly because it seemed as though none of the characters were ever truly happy.  It's not like it was a tear-jerker or anything, but it was one upheaval/disappointment/tragedy/issue after another.  In the end, all the characters kind of settled back down to live with the decisions they had made, but when the book ended, it still felt as though it would take many months (or even longer) for people to get their lives back on track and regain even some semblence of complacency.	2000-12-26

Being from Maine and also being familiar with the locale of this book made this even more fun to read.  This is the first of Crossman's series about Winston Crisp (a retired code-breaker with the National Security Agency) which takes place on Penobscot Island.  Winston unwittingly gets drawn into a local murder even though he (sort of) tries to stay out of it.  Crossman does a wonderful job of bringing readers into the story with his descriptions of the island and the cold (and sometimes unmerciful) Maine island weather in winter.  This is definitely a great book to settle in with when you feel like spreading your wings and trying a new author.	2000-12-26

You can definitely tell that the protagonist (Stanley Waters) was modeled after Willard Scott, but in this his first book (in collaboration with Bill Crider), I think Mr. Scott has a hit.  From the opening page where the victim falls face first into a bowl of salsa dip, through the rest of the book in fictional Higgins, Virginia, it is definitely a trip worth making.  The characters, despite all their faults and complexities, are fun to follow.  This is an excellent first book, and is great if you are looking for a quick, fun read.	2000-12-26

I have yet to get so disgusted with a series that I actually stop reading it, but this one is getting close.  I keep reading them because I am curious as to how the author is going to dig herself out the hole she has created.  I am sick and tired of Kay's perfection.  She's a doctor, a lawyer, a forensic pathologist, the Chief Medical examiner, a certified scuba diver, etc., etc., etc.  She is selfless to the point of being unreal.  There are even passages in the book where Kay thinks to herself that she should be worried about what's coming up for her, but all she can think about is her niece's problems and feelings.  And speaking of her niece, the author puts way too much emphasis on Lucy's sexual orientation.  It is emphasized in some way almost every time Lucy's name comes up.  I can understand pointing it out at the beginning of the book for those readers who are just entering the series, but to keep pointing it out throughout the whole book is too much (and the author has done this ever since Lucy joined the FBI).  As for Marino, I don't expect the author to change him into a candidate for GQ, but his constant angry attitude, foul mouth, and slovenly looks are getting really hard to bear. How come Kay seems to be the only one who sees any good in him?  Despite my rantings, I will go on and read her next book, The Last Precinct.  I am curious to see where the storyline goes because she left this one so abruptly, but at this point, I can't give a ringing endorsement and would encourage people to either start at the beginning of this series or don't bother.	2000-12-05

I just discovered this series a few years ago.  I enjoyed the first few books immensely and thought Cornwell had a good series started.  However, I took a long hiatus from the series before picking up this particular book.  I find the protagonist hard to relate to and the Lucy storyline not relevant to the plot in any way.  I have to agree with some other reviewers when they said this would have been a good place to end the series.  I will continue to read the series for now, but am finding them increasingly harder and harder to get into.	2000-12-05

As I stated when I reviewed her last book, I continue to read this series to see if the author can redeem herself.  Not happening.  The only thing about this book that brought me any satisfaction was finally seeing the protagonist as part of the problem, not the solution.  Seeing her professional life, personal life, etc., brought into question and put under scrutiny made this book a little more realistic than her previous one.  I don't want to appear as though I enjoy seeing people's lives picked apart and exposed, but it doesn't appear as though Kay has ever done anything wrong or made any mistakes, and this book finally brings that under scrutiny.  The other issue with her books is that even though the protagonist is a medical examiner, the author could leave out quite a bit of the descriptive stuff about what goes on in the morgue during an autopsy. For the most part, much of the descriptive stuff does not promote the plot or storyline and appears to be filler.  My recommendation would be not to let this be your first Scarpetta novel.  Start at the beginning of the series, and then decide whether or not you want to continue up to this point.	2000-12-05

I have to say that Lee Child has made a smashing debut in mystery writing with his Jack Reacher novels.  For some reason, I liked the storyline in the first book better, but this one wasn't too far below it.  He kept the  action going at all times, and kept you wondering what was going to happen  to who, and when.  As with the first one, he was able to write a great book  without the profanity that a lot of writers use. That in itself puts him  right near the top of my list.  I can't wait to dive into the third Reacher  novel and see where he ends up next.	2000-07-24

I have to say, as debut novels go, Lee Child reached out and  grabbed my full attention with this one.  From beginning to end, there wasn't one part of this book that didn't keep me wondering what was going to happen next.   Despite being a little graphic in a couple of places (which is to be  expected in this type of book), I immensely appreciate an author who can  write a book like this that holds your interest and attention and not once  felt compelled to the 'f' word (or some of the other vulgarities that some  authors feel the need to use).  I have already started his second Jack  Reacher novel, and so far it promises to be as good as this one.	2000-07-20

Her vivid  and rich descriptions of the people and places she writes about make me  want to hop a plane and go visit.  Penelope Keeling is a character that is  real and believable, from her memories of her childhood to her thoughts of  her grown children and their future.  This story brings a realistic view of  two of Penelope's grown children whose only thoughts are of the money that  could come from the sale of Penelope's father's painting.  And of her third  child (also grown) who only wants her mother's happiness.  Rosamunde  Pilcher has a real winner with this story.	2000-07-11

Even if it is part of a  series, or if there is going to be a sequel, each book should be  self-contained and with completed storylines.  I feel like I was left  reading half a book.

However, following all the publicity about this book, I picked it up hoping for something different, and it was.  Personally, I enjoyed this book to  the fullest.  It had a touch of romance, a lot of paranormal, and at times  made my heart race by being scary without being gross and gory.  Whether or  not you believe in it, this book brings into question the possible presence  of spirits and the incredible perceptions that sometimes children have that  adults don't (or choose not to).  It was long, and I did think a couple of  times that King probably could have shortened it a litte bit, but I'm glad  I took the time to read it.  I enjoyed it.	2000-07-07

I thought this book was a wonderful look into past and what things were like four or five decades ago.  There was such a diverse cast of characters and the author made them all beliveable.

I did not realize this book was part of a series or I would have read Too Deep for Tears first.  However, this book does well as a stand alone, also.

I found this book very hard to read, since the author jumped back and forth continuously from past to present.  Not only that, but he would make a statement and then go off on a tanget and back it up with two or three  paragraphs worth of filler; sometimes making a comment that would give you  a glimpse into either the past or the future, and sometimes not, thus  making it hard to follow.  As for the content, I was not impressed.  Here  is a 35 year-old man who emotionally hurts his mother, wife, and daughter  over and over again, all the while condemning himself and saying he  realizes what he's doing to them is wrong, but he can't seem to help  himself. However, if the author's literary goal is to get the reader to  read the whole book, then he was successful in that.  As hard as I found  this book to read and follow sometimes, I saw it through to the end just to  see how it would turn out.  Unfortunately, it was not the type of ending  that made the time and effort of reading the book worthwhile.  I thought it  was very disappointing, to say the least.	2000-07-03

After the many wonderful things I have heard about this book and this author, I was so disappointed.  I finished the book, but it was hard.  I thought the storyline was disjointed (and unbelieveable) and hard to follow.  There's not even a  single section or paragraph to this book that I can think back on and say,  &quot;Well, that part was okay.&quot;  The second part was even more  disappointing than the first.	2000-01-26

Although I own eight of the books in this series, this is the first one I have gotten around to reading.  I thought the storyline flowed very easily (without all the ups and downs of the mystery books I usually read) and was  easy to follow.  The characters were real and believable, and there weren't  so many of them that you lost track of who was who.  Although I have cats,  and believe that they can have mysterious qualities all their own, I don't  necessarily care for the connotation that the Siamses cats have some level  of 'psychic' ability--I think this part is majorly overplayed.  All in all,  though, I thought it was a good read, and I'm sure I'll be reading more of  her books in the future.	1999-02-10
US	52998086	R37KVHZRAKF4D7	0688149626	937357785	High Crimes	Books	3	0	1	N	N	A really good read!	The plot twist at the end of this book was great.  You almost knew that  the story wasn't going to be a straightfoward as you thought, but neither  did you know which way it was going to turn.  This was the first book I  have read by Joseph Finder--I hope his others are as equally engrossing.	1998-08-23

This book started out a little slow, and at times it was hard to keep track of who was who because all the characters seemed to intermingle so much (along with changing names and using false names).  However, as the book progressed it was this intermingling of characters that kept you wondering how the book was going to end.  Everybody was plotting against everybody else and you didn't know who was going to live, who was going to end up dead, and who was going to end up with 'the cup'.  All in all, it wasn't a bad read.	1998-08-07
US	52998086	R2JSGGTR7ED87P	0446519960	426701570	Absolute Power	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Very absorbing!	This was a very interesting and absorbing book. The only reason I didn't read it in one sitting was that I didn't have time.  I was anxious to see how the characters would unravel.  In this story, you wonder if good really will triumph over evil, if only because the 'evil' happens to be the leader of the nation and his Secret Service agents and nobody ever suspected--even when everybody related to the case keeps getting killed.  This book was definitely worth the time it took me to read it.	1998-08-07

Although the book wasn't exactly riveting, I read the whole thing in almost one sitting.  The characters were easy to understand, and there weren't so many characters that you forgot who was who.  The book was an easy read, and had just enough steam to it to keep me wondering what would happen next and how things would unfold.  I was disappointed in the ending--feeling as though I had been left hanging with some loose ends that should have been tied up.	1998-07-27

It starts out much the same as diving into a swimming pool with no water - it hits rock bottom and never quite recovers.  I have to admit that I am making this review based on the fact that I have not finished the book (nor do I intend to waste my precious spare time trying).  I couldn't even get through one chapter without putting the book down.  I kept coming back to it hoping it would get better, but it never did.  I managed to slog through the first ten chapters (before I called it quits) trying to get a grip on the story and find even one phrase or line that even remotely held my interest (didn't happen).   The story lines are choppy and keep jumping  back and forth.  I'm sure the characters and storylines  probably meld together to form a story somewhere later in this book, but I refuse to waste any more time on this book trying to get to that poin! t.  The only thing about this book that says 'bestseller' is the title.	1998-07-23
US	52998086	R20ECKFOJWP859	0805036504	595466515	N is for Noose	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Not Up to Grafton's Usual Standards	Having read the whole alphabet mystery by Grafton, I would have to say that she is slipping a little bit.  Although I have enjoyed them all, a few of them took me a little time to get through.  This one took me quite a while to get through.  It  was slow to build and didn't keep the reader in suspense or wondering who-dunnit.  I hope that Grafton doesn't turn around and put out &quot;O&quot; just to keep up with her standard of putting one out every year.  I think she needs to take a little time and build a more intricate and suspenseful plot.  I do like the way she incorporates people from Kinsey's past in and out of the storylines.  I also like the way she ever so slowly incorporated Kinsey's family in Lompoc into a couple of books and then we didn't hear anything about them for a couple of books.  I hope Grafton doesn't make the mistake of having Kinsey's family descend en masse like a title wave into Kinsey's life just to bring some fresh blood into the picture.  Th! at would be a mistake.  Incorporating them slowly into the alphabet books is a much better idea.  We'll just have to wait and see what &quot;O&quot; brings.	1998-07-23

This is the third book I have read from Oprah's book club, and so far, none of them have succeeded in keeping me interested.  Books with storylines which switch back and forth from past to present are hard to follow, and this one was no exception.  I bought this book at the same time I bought Kaye's other book, Ellen Foster, figuring I would read them one after another.  However, I have not yet been able to bring myself to read Ellen Foster for fear of the same type of drudgery I endured reading this one.  I might read another of her books if I pick one up at the library, but I sure won't waste my money buying one.	1998-06-23

I kept reading because I figured it couldn't get any worse--but it did.  It was depressing, and the skipping around of story lines made it hard to get into.  I forced myself to continue figuring something good had to happen to somebody at some point--and it didn't. I'm sorry I wasted my time.	1998-06-10
US	52998086	R2OZ3ZH1L913PE	0805036377	235216689	M is for Malice (The Kinsey Millhone Alphabet Mysteries)	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Not as engrossing as the previous books.	Having followed the alphabet adventures of Sue Grafton's female heroine, Kinsey Millhone, I think the author is losing steam.  'Malice' had a couple of good twists and turns in the storyline, and although I still find them enjoyable, her later books have failed to hold my attention the way her earlier books did.  The author needs to pack a few punches if she is planning to continue with the other half of the alphabet.	1998-06-05
