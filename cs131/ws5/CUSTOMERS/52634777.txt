This guy offers advice like going to the guy in the front of the line at a barber shop and giving him a sob story about how your mom just died. Another suggestion is to pick a wimp at the front of the line in a crowded amusement park and try to make him think that you're a man of God who has to get the orphans back in an hour. Would he please just let you in in front of him. Then if he doesn't oblidge, there's a reason you picked a wimp. You now threaten him with physical violence.<br /><br />If those methods suit you, you'll probably like the book.	2004-12-31

It quite clearly states the truth and makes the case for just how we have gotten into the mess we're in regarding our patterns of self-hate, self-invalidation and self-domination. Isn't there something a little insane about intending to dominate ourselves? Yet how often to we attempt to punish ourselves to effect a change. We have been functioning with a convoluted view of this world and how people (including ourselves) should be treated. This book is a lucid description of the condition and the antidote.	2003-11-23

It is the best discretionary money I have spent this year... no kidding. What I love about it is how I can listen while I'm driving, or working around the house, and immerse myself in these ideas. My state of being has been changing. I notice that I'm usually driving around with a big grin on my face and I have this sense that there is nothing to do, nothing to be, nothing to have, that what is present is just perfect. And in that I have found peace and happiness.<br />Thank you Katie. I love you.	2003-05-04

For the first time, I understand how transcending effect can undo cause. By forgiving, I can undo the effect of an attack. A cause which had no effect wasn't actually a cause, now was it? If I can undo cause, I have erased guilt. Without guilt, there is only innocence. This is how we can absolve the world we see of sin. Amazing!<br />Now, consider this. This principle has to work both ways. If I can undo cause by not being effected, then I can create cause by being effected. I can feel loved, and elect you as the cause of it.<br />(Yes, it's still illussion, but what a delicious illussion. The reason it's illussion, is that in either case, I am secretly the cause... shhhh, don't tell anybody).	2002-09-03

Perhaps that's the scientist doing his best to provide adequate proof. I found myself wanting to say, come on already... I accept your argument, let's get to it.<br /><br />With that said, I did enjoy the book and find Sheldrake's proof more than adequate. Many animals are sensitive in ways we don't understand.<br /><br />There was a story, from the book, of someone who was going to commit suicide by overdose. When they went to open the bottle, their Springer spaniel jumped in their lap, bearing it's teeth and growling fiercely. The person was so shaken that they put the pills away, at which point, the Springer jumped back in the lap and happily lapped at their owners face.<br /><br />I knew of a young girl who was walking home, down a deserted street, when a sedan approached with a man demanding that she get in the car. She began to walk faster... the car sped up... the demands became angrier... The car stopped, and a man got out and came towards her... She said the only prayer she could think of at the time. \\"God, please help me.\\" Suddenly two dogs appeared and began barking at the man. Shaken, but not dissuaded, he reached for the girl, and a beagle japed up and bit his wrist. That was enough, the man got back into the car and it sped off.<br /><br />It has been over 6 years since that incident and the girl still goes to the farmhouse near where this happened to visit Molly and Dolly.<br /><br />By the way, that was not their names when all of this happened... You see, no one had ever seen these two dogs before... before that fateful night when a young girls prayer was answered... by two dogs who appeared from nowhere.<br /><br />This story was related by Paul Harvey on his program *The Rest of the Story* December 8, 1999<br /><br />Have you ever found yourself staring at someone and they turn and look directly at you. How do they do that? How do pigeons find their way home from hundreds of miles away?

I've written a lot of five star reviews. I tend to comment when I have praise to offer. This book just took me to a whole new level of appreciation for a writer. It's like the difference between, \\"Yes, I think you are a lovely person\\" and \\"There isn't one thing about you which I don't find absolutely loveable.\\"<br />I urge you to buy this book, and expand your own vision of what is possible: in a loving relationship, as one approaches the end of this physical existence, and within the human heart and soul.<br />This book woke me up. It reminded me about Love. (Saying that, the words seem so inadequate) The truth is, I can't come close to conveying the Love which comes through in this book. Its personal love directed toward a wife, a husband, a family. It's universal Love which calls to you to find your way home. It beckons \\"Promise you will find me again.\\"<br />I just finished reading the last chapter, and I cried and cried. I remembered what it was like when my mom died. Dannion Brinkley said that when someone dies, the doors to Heaven open up, and energy flows in both directions. I'll second that. My mothers death was one of the most sacred experiences of my life.<br />Reading this, I also remembered Love. A friend of mine used to tease his wife. She would say \\"Honey, do you love me?\\" And he would respond, \\"Only when I stop and think about it.\\" Love is like that isn't it? If we don't stop and become present to Love, then Love isn't present in our awareness, and that which isn't present in our awareness isn't real to us in the present moment. At best, it is a myth about a \\"Once upon a time/somewhere someday\\" experience.<br />This book, and especially the last chapter increased my awareness of Love so dramatically, I felt like I just woke up. And then it repeated the experience. I just kept waking up to more and more love. I am overflowing with humble gratitude for the gift that reading this book is to me.<br />Thank you Ken. Thank you Treya. Thanks for reminding me of what I live for.<br />I have a request of you the reader. If you do nothing else, go to a bookstore and read the last chapter. I promise that if you are anything like me, it will flat out blow you away. Your reading that chapter will further the conversation of freedom. It will further the conversation of Love as a present moment reality.

It got my attention. I have observed over and over again that it is awareness of the impact of my actions that creates change, and once the awareness is there, the change comes through me rather than from me. Once I became aware that smoking was killing my mother and wasn't giving me anything that I truly wanted, I just stopped doing something that I didn't want to do.<br />Having recently read and enjoyed Loving What Is by Byron Katie, I was drawn here by a review of her book which recommended this one as well. Then when I saw a couple of sour reviews, I dismissed them as negativity from resigned and cynical people who couldn't believe in the possibility of transformation.<br />I rushed right out and bought the book that very night, and read it in a couple of hours.<br />The conversations in this book are great. If you haven't come across them before, I think you'll love this introduction to them. So, I have no quarrel with those who love this book.<br />I did find that I had already come across pretty much every conversation/idea presented in this book before. It appears to me that the Kane's wrote a book containing some of the more powerful conversations from The Landmark Forum. (Landmark is the current iteration of est.) The resemblance is just uncanny. Not that those ideas or conversations are even unique to Landmark, but the grouping and presentation of them, seems to defy coincidence. For instance:<br />* Transformation is the result of awareness, rather than an effort to fix or change.<br />* Who I am is not a function of my past, but rather the future I'm living into.<br />* Forgiveness as an access to completion and growth.<br />* When you see it as it is, it will disappear.<br />* How to dissappear physical pain by paying attention to it.<br />* What happened in the past is what happened; the meaning of what happened is something we placed there.<br />* What you resist persists.<br />* The difference between choice and decision.<br />* The idea of an inner voice which is always listening and commenting on our experience and thoughts.<br />So, if you feel that you are already well versed in these conversations, you can pass on reading this book. I personally don't regret reading it, or having it to lend to others.<br />If the topics listed above are new to you, by all means join us in these conversations... through this book... through other books... through Landmark... there's lots of roads that lead here.

Her expereiences correlate with what is reported in this book and on the video by the same name.<br />I think one of the great things about the video is that it addresses different aspects of the experience, and actually shows the people who have had them reporting on how the experience occurred for this person, and this person, and this one. To me this gives validity to the experiences. There is a common thread that runs from experience to experience, person to person, which transcends personal experience and points to something Universal. It is a convincing case for the existence of life after death, and the ecstatic union that later life entails.<br />This book/video has the power to unwrap the fear that we have around death and liberate us.

Darryl says that he had two up close, broad daylight sightings of Bashar's space craft; that Bashar is a future-self of his (who he will be in a future life); that this channeling is the result of an agreement the two of them made before this lifetime. Do I believe it? Well, I'm certainly open to it being true. OK, if I had to answer, I'd say yes, I believe it.<br />What I know is that I used to sit in a living room every Monday and Tuesday night listening to Bashar for about three hours an evening. This book contains verbatim transcripts from introductory statements made by Bashar at those channelings.<br />I was quite impressed by the way Bashar would answer spontaneous questions from random attendees, without even pausing to consider an answer. Someone would ask a question, and boom, Bashar would come back with an answer which would frequently blow us away with it's power and clarity, and wisdom.<br />No matter what you believed about the channeling process, if you sat there with an open mind you had to realize that you were in the presence of sheer genius and profound wisdom. I highly recommend this book,<br />As good as the book is though, my opinion is that there is a lot of power in Bashar's presence. If you have the opportunity to attend a channeling, I recommend it.

That's a tricky one for most of us, isn't it? We're more inclined to think, \\"Yeah, I love you, but if you cross this line, you're out.\\" Unconditional love can't exist within \\"I love you but.\\"<br />Well here's a woman who has taken the masters class in unconditional love, and has turned around to teach it. She gives format and formula for conversations which create breakthroughs and transformation... Transformation, you know where you're no longer the person who had the problem... where you don't have to do anything to fix or change the problem. The \\"problem\\" just isn't part of who you are any longer, therefore it no longer exists in your world.<br />Most of what we do to try to improve our world doesn't help, and why is that? Because we try to create change by resisting what we don't want. And what you resist persists. The harder you push it out of your life, the more solidly it is there.<br />But how do you create change otherwise? That can be a tricky question, and this book is full of easy answers. And guess who's answers they are? Yours! Katie doesn't try to push any of her ideas down your throat, or program you with new beliefs. She simply offers a system of inquiry that allows your attention to rest on what isn't working about the stories you tell yourself about reality. Without the stories, it's quite effortless to love what is. Simple as that.<br />If you want to love people, this book will help.<br />If you want to love yourself,<br />If you want to love your life,<br />If you want to be at peace,<br />If you want to be happy, this book will help.<br />I promise.<br />--Frank Boyd	2002-05-22

You know, I seldom read ACIM alone. My opinion is that it might as well have been written so that you needed a study group to understand it. It is rigorous reading, and demands focus and attention, however, that doesn't render it without value.<br />Someone below recommended that you first go to Marianne Williamson's book A Return to Love. That is a great way to start on this material. I remember that when I read Marianne's book I felt it was the best book I had ever read, and it's still high on my list.<br />If you do want to get directly into ACIM, I recommend that you find a study group in your area. You could do this from a web search, or Unity churches frequently have study groups, although they don't officially align themselves with the material (at least to my knowledge). If you get into a study group, I suggest that you watch to see that they are working with the book, rather than just having conversations around their interpretations and rememberances. The words of ACIM are crafted so well and so deliberately... there is power in them  --Frank Boyd	2002-05-20

They are in most major cities in the US, and around the world. They do a fine job. Not only will they let you go home and sleep on it after an introduction, they'll even give you your money back if you're not satisfied. I began the training in January of 2002, and find the organization to be one of the most ethical and effective I have ever come across.	2002-04-27

It is filled with interesting stories. I thuroughly enjoyed it. I'm not convinced that his training is worth $2,400, but I liked the book.<br />If your interested, there is also a book called Resurfacing which has many of the exercises from the first couple of days of the Avatar training.	2001-11-20

I'm convinced that the development of this awareness is integral to our progress as sentient beings.<br />If you want to get further into the present moment, and challenge your ability to respond spontaneously to Life, and have a blast doing it, this is a great place to look.	2001-11-20

It also guides you in opening to that wisdom and bringing it forth in your life.<br />If I may, let me suggest that as you delve into this subject, don't be concearned with where the information is coming from. Evaluate the information on it's own merit. If it makes sense to you, and works for you... if it has relevance to your life and those close to you... if it has a positive effect on you and others, take it and use it. If not, feel free to dismiss it, even if the source claims to be God His/Her/Itself.<br />Genuine wisdom will meet you where you are, and lead from there. Don't get hung up on titles, or hierarchical ideas of Source. Love knows nothing of levels.	2001-11-20

I love this man so much. He's like the spiritual father I never had. He tells stories and weaves tales that reach straight into my heart and remind me of Love, and how important that Love is to me... no matter how much I've tried to pretend to the contrary.<br />This particular book has helped me to bring forth my emotional self, again. I've just cried and cried while reading it. Don't be scared though; when it comes to Love, I'm a bigger softee than anyone else I know. Hahaha, in movies my 10 year old will look over at me crying and just wonder.<br />If you're a softee, or have ever been a softee, or wish you had more contact with your inner-softee, pick up this book. It's a really easy read. And if you're anything like me, pick up some tissues too. You are in store for a treat.<br />Frank Boyd, Scottsdale, AZ	2001-07-07

I've probably listened to this tape 6 times in the last two weeks. She makes such a clear statement about what anger is, where it comes from, how to relate to it, and how and why to get from anger to forgivness.<br />If you want to understand anger, and behave as a master in relation to anger, I can't recommend this tape highly enough.	2001-07-01

She touches my heart, and reminds me of the wonderful truth about all of us... that we deserve to be loved... that there is a spirit of Love that has never left us...<br />This tape (two lectures, approximately 30 minutes each) will help you to see beyond the things that you thought stood between you and a more loving relationship with your parents. I give it my highest recommendation. And I don't throw that around lightly, but I don't hold it back when it's deserved....	2001-07-01

There are some fundamental principals in Book 1 which would be helpful in understanding Book 2. Book 2 doesn't grab you quite the way Book 1 did, but it is still a very interesting read. Parts of it are excellent. I just wish that Neale hadn't spent so much time filling us in on what happened in Book 1. The two books together are some of the most impactful I have ever read. Even if you completely discount the source, which you are feee to do, you will come away with some radical yet sensible new ways of looking at things	1997-05-15

He unites many branches of philosophy and psychology in this book. He provides understanding why so many truths contradict each other. Ponder this: (paraphrased from the text)Unity consciousness, or no-boundary consciousness, by definition has no boundary. As such, you could say that there is no boundary which seperates us from It in this moment. Logic tells us that this must be true. The only thing which prevents us from experiencing No-Boundary Awareness right now, is our resistance to it. The book is not exactly &quot;light&quot; reading, but if you are willing to put on your thinking cap, it is certainly fascinating	1997-01-28
