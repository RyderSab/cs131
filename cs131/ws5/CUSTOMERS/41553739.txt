I read it in two days.  Wish there was a sequel.  I liked the women so much, especially the one who finds a lover after 3 years of doing without.  I wept.  And same for  Nina who is taking care of her dying mother...the others made me laugh hysterically...especially the one who wears endangered species and eats at restaurants that charge $200 prix fixe.  Her nose job and liposuction...it's so hilarious -- She fixes everything by finding people apartments.  This is the ultimate girlfriend book.	2002-07-07

There should be a higher rating to express my utter rapture with this fantastic book.  I never thought there would be an accurate novel to depict the real life stories of working women in their 30's, 40's This is so much more intelligent than Sex and the City, they are not on the same planet.  These women make their way in the world, navigate through city life and have believable affairs with men.  I loved the Postcoital divide...into which a man disappears after sex.  Too funny, so true.  I fell in love with the Native American man who sweeps the hostess off her feet, their love scene is truly beautiful.  This is sex that is not embarassing to read, yet true and utterly evocative.  My friends are all reading it and say the same thing.  This is a gift!	2002-07-03

This is about the mind, soul and the body and about a beleagured city. These women are the real thing -- friends to the end, no matter what.  They may fight, disagree but they have become more than friends.  Sexier than Sex and the City, for really smart women who do not wish to be condescended to...Truly fine writing by a memoirist, writing her first novel.  Funny, sad and true, true, true.	2002-07-03

I kept sneaking peeks,  read some out loud, took it to work and to the beach...now I read it in its entirety and regret it's over.  This is a sweet, meaningful story about single working professsional women around New York.  It is dignified and smart yet howlingly hilarious.  I give this my highest rating. The woman who feeds her fiance the viagara is maybe, maybe the funniest creation in contemporary literature.  You'll hear loads re this beaut.	2002-07-03

Men as well as women will love this scintillating, hilarious, yet moving story of six women friends who gather on one frigid night.  This is incredibly candid, even sensual but never coarse.  This is truly as unusual as the reviews indicate: a literate novel of women of the city and their deepest needs and feelings.  My sister bought it and I borrowed it...We are quoting already...A soon to be classic of modern angst and love among the denizens of the dark heart of the asphalt jungle.  New York ( and Every City) glitters, glowers and glows...I love these women, whose souls are as beautiful as their 'bodies\\"...A sensitive introspective yet funny book.	2002-06-24

The tears were followed by laughter.  I looked into this novel as into a mirror.  How do you know all this? I ask the author.  Can you read my mind?  Do you know me?  And my friends?  I felt my body and soul were exposed and I did not want this book to end.  There are erotic sequence too, that seem so true, I wonder if they are memories.  Destined to be read widely by women with above average intelligence. I will read it again and again, and give to my best friends in a chain of friendship...Loved, loved, loved it!	2002-06-22
