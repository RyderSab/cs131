Scott Fitzgerald: Novels and Stories 1920-1922: This Side of Paradise / Flappers and Philosophers / The Beautiful and the Damned / Tales of the Jazz Age (Library of America)	Books	5	55	56	N	N	Good Collection of Pre-Gatsby Work	This is a very attractive packaged, comprehensive collection of Fitzgerald's early work, containing his first two novels (This Side of Paradise and The Beautiful &amp; Damned) and his first two short story collections.  Included are some classic short stories such as May Day and The Diamond As Big As The Ritz.  Some of the other stories are less than classic, but all are enjoyable.  As is the case with all Library of America volumes, the book is very easy to handle and read.  There is a useful set of notes and chronology of Fitzergald's life in the back.  All in all, this is well worth the price.	2000-11-12

The same few themes recur again and again, the same absurdities are repeatedly flogged, until you start thinking &quot;that horse is dead, start beating up on something else&quot;.  Another problem is that Frank doesn't do a very good job of explaining alternatives to the market.  He gives us a lot of boilerplate about democracy and equality but not much insight about how increased government intervention in the economy would actually work.	2000-11-07

The central character is sympathetic in a pale sort of way, but he's not very interesting or perceptive, and this lack of perception becomes irritating when the whole novel is written from his point of view.  The whole scenario is not very dramatic, which is unusual with James; generally there are  real conflicts in his novels, even if they are hard to locate through the mists of his prose.  The lack of conflict in this book makes the whole thing tedious, despite the intelligence and subtlety of the author.	2000-11-07

In this, as in other ways, Clinton is the Democrat's answer to Nixon, who governed as a liberal while exploiting the prejudices of the right.  Hitchens sees this connection, and, even more clearly, sees how morally and intellectually bankrupt the &quot;left&quot; has become.	2000-10-24

Before reading I wondered  how a man of his background could write about working class political  conspirators.  He does so by making his protagonist an exquisitely  sensitive young bookbinder who becomes involved in a political movement he  only dimly comprehends.  The bookbinder, Hyacinth, is befriended by the  Princess Casamissima, a charming, completely self-absorbed young beauty who  is trying to find herself in radical political activity.  The plot is,  therefore, more of a fairy tale than a realistic portait of   &quot;typical&quot; working class revolutionaries, but on its own terms it  is plausible enough.  The style is leisurely and fairly complex, but not  nearly as convoluted as James's last works.  <br />The great value of this  book lies in its nuanced characterizations.  All of the characters are  wholly rounded and believable, and while they are all flawed in some way,  not one of them is wholly unsympathetic.  The Princess is the most  interesting of all; through her James shows how  bored, unsatisfied  aristocrats can dabble in radical politics with disasterous results.  He  does so, however, without reducing her to a caricature.	2000-09-16

Shorris mixes in hardheaded commentary  about business with lengthy discussions of political philosopophy.  His  thesis is that the modern corporation has a good deal in common with  totalitarian systems of government.  While the modern business leaders and  their cadres of managers and psychologists are much better intentioned and  more genteel than political dictators, their impact on employees can be  similarly soul-crushing.  Shorris illustrates the effect of business   policies with a series of fictional vignettes which will ring painfully  true  to anybody who has worked for a large organization.  Any corporate  employee who wants to get beyond dilbert-type easy sarcasm and understand  what is really happening to his life should read this book.	2000-09-13

This is not Merton's purpose.  He is trying to give us a sense of  the spiritual essence of the fathers, and he does it brilliantly.  Although  he is not as elegant a writer as Waddell, nor as learned, he has a much  deeper intuitive understanding of the fathers' search for God and their  love for each other. His selections emphasize the importance of this love  and downplay the fanatical asceticism that many people associate with the  fathers.  Throughout his introduction, he emphasizes that love is far more  important in the Christian life than either mysticism or asceticism.  Thus,  although a sympathetic reader may not learn terribly much about the history  of the desert fathers from Merton, she will begin to understand &quot;the  wisdom of the desert&quot;.	2000-09-07

Obviously Nietzsche sees himself as the madman, sacrificing  himself to bring humanity the awful news.  What's odd is that Nietzsche was  certainly not the first person to proclaim God's death; in fact, as he  himself notes elsewhere, many educated people had already become either  agnostic or atheistic.  None of them, however, found this as earthshaking  as Nietzsche.  The reason, I think, is that he had an essentially religious  nature. The word &quot;spiritual&quot; recurs throught the book.  In one  remarkable passage he even chastises St. Augustine for being insufficiently  spiritual.<br />The Gay Science is a pivitol book for Nietzsche because it is  the first in which the tension between the spiritual seeker and the atheist  becomes manifest.  Gone is the skeptical pose of &quot;Human All Too  Human&quot;; instead we have the anguish of a man torn between two  conflicting ideals.  The tension, while it ravaged Nietzsche, did produce  some brilliant ideas and unforgettable prose, even if it did not ultimately  lead to a liveable philosophy.	2000-09-07

At the time it was written, however, Johnson wasn't very well known  himself and was only marginally more respectable than Savage.  Holmes does  an excellent job of describing their relationship and showing us how  Johnson lived before he bacame a tory sage.  He provides an excellent  counterweight to Boswell, who tended to play down Johnson's awkwardness and  barely concealed rage.  At the same time, Holmes never forgets that Johnson  was a great writer and man.	2000-09-06

He's a particularly good book  reviewer, with tastes ranging from Rider Haggard to Henry James.  He is, in  fact, particularly fine on James, which is somewhat surprising, since at  first glance they wouldn't seem to have much in common.  They both,  however, were deeply concerned with the craft of fiction, and it is that  interest in craftmanship, more so than Greene's political or religious  views,  which dominates these essays.	2000-08-29

It is, however, hard to  tell a story from twelve different points of view, so the plot kind of gets  lost in the shuffle. Since plot was never Thompson's strong suit, this  really isn't too much of a loss.

Thomism is now seen as the epitome of  Catholic Orthodoxy, but it was not certainly not treated that way during  Thomas's lifetime for reasons that Chesteron makes masterfully clear. He  also makes an excellent case for the importance of intellect in religion  and the possibility of an optimistic approach to Catholicism.  As other  reviewers have noted, he does tend to make sweeping   pronouncements about  subjects he doesn't understand very well;  I, for one, think he doesn't  appreciate   Nietzsche or  St. Augustine any better than he does Eastern  religions.  These aree minor irritations, however, which don't detract much  from the overall accomplishment of the book.	2000-08-21

As a result, he tends to minimize Francis's strangenes and  radicalism.  He seems determined to present him as a non-intellectual  version of Thomas Aquinas; in other words, as a man who, in an intuitive  way, personified and revitalized mainstream Catholicism.  Chesterton's  arguments are, as always, persuasive but only intermittently convincing.   Ultimately, I think Francis had more in common with medieval  &quot;heretics&quot; than with the mainstream church, and that the church  decided to tolerate and coopt him because they knew that his popularity  made persecuting him too dangerous.  Chesterton does his best to defeat  this argument,  but ultimately he doesn't succeed. <br />Having said this, I  think the book is well worth reading.  Francis is a fascinating subject no  matter how he is approached, and Chesterton is always interesting.  It  would be nice, however, if he were just a little less clever.  There are a  few too many epigrams per page, to the point where you sometimes want to  tell him to just shut up and get on with his story.	2000-08-21

It starts off great with &quot;The Killer Inside Me&quot;, the all  time best trip through a killer's mind.  The selections by Highsmith and  Goodis, while not as intense as &quot;Killer&quot;, are just as good in  their own quieter ways.  The only novel I would have left out is  &quot;Pickup&quot;; while I like Willeford I think this is one of his more  leaden performances.  I also have a quibble with the volume's title, as the  word &quot;noir&quot; has been beaten to death and doesn't tell us much  about most of these books.  &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; owes more  to Henry James than to Raymond Chandler, and &quot;Killer&quot; doesn't  feature any dark city streets.  Quibbles aside, however, the book is well  worth buying.	2000-07-08

Until I forced myself to slow down I kept losing the thread and having to  go back.  As a result, I could only make it through around 10 pages a day.   Once you make the adjustment, however, it is a very rewarding reading  experience.  Having read many of James's earlier, more accessible works, I  could't at first understand the point behind  the convoluted style.  It  seemed as if everthing was not only exceedingly slow but also very hazy, in  sharp contrast to the vividness of The Portrait of A Lady.  There is  however, a method to James's madness.  Instead of showing us a scene  through an omniscient author's eyes, he is trying to render his characters'  experiences of reality.  For example, instead of a carefully painted  portait of a English dinner party, we are shown how a young American woman  would process it in her mind. The winding, comma-clotted sentences don't  draw us a picture, but instead attempt to mirror the character's stream of  consciousness. The result is fascinating, but also exhausting.  It's worth  the effort, but it's a good thing that most other great novels, including  James's earlier ones, don't require this much work.	2000-07-08

It is amazing how he uses his mastery of narrative technique to unsettle the reader.  It is never clear in the &quot;Turn of the Screw&quot; whether the ghosts actually  exist or whether the narrator herself is deluded. Similarly, in &quot;The  Aspern Papers&quot; the narrator seems to be eminently reasonable and  civilized, but his actions are anything but.  This story, in its quiet,  &quot;boring&quot; fashion, throws a very disturbing light on literary  biographers.  In fact, this is one of James's trademarks, the ability to  probe the dark side of refined, genteel people.	2000-06-10

In this novel, unlike many of his others, he has a compelling story to tell, which he invests with great humor and effectively restrained emotion.

Most of the descriptions are evocative, if depressing, the dialogue rings true, and the characters, for all their unpleasantness, are believable. The political observations are also acute,  although the passage of time has made Naipaul's political incorrectness  less provocative. The book is, however, ultimately too cold and harsh to be  a great work.  You finish it with the uneasy sense that its ugly features,  particularly the misogyny and sexual hysteria, are an all too accurate  projection of its creator's mind.	2000-06-04

Even people who don't accept Nietzsche's basic approach to life can learn much from it, if they read it  with an open (but skeptical) mind.  All of Nietzsche's key ideas are here  and are presented more lucidly than in Zarathustra and more sanely than in  his last works.  Even better than the big ideas are the seemingly random  insights that can illuminate a whole new area of thought.  There are also,  it's true, some really stupid passages, such as the comments on women, but  overall the gold far outweighs the dross.	2000-05-31

If you feel that way you'll love this book, since it presents his anti-christian ideas in their most  vehement form.  If your views on Christianity and related issues are more  nuanced (or wishy-washy), you'd be better off reading Beyond Good and Evil  and The Geneaology of Morals, where the same ideas are discussed more  calmly and lucidly.	2000-05-31
