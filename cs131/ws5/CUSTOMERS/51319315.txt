I thought that with a book that encompassed the entire country it could help me narrow down where we wanted to travel.<br />I found that this book is more geared to the backpackers or very cost-aware traveler.  So, for our honeymoon, when we were looking for luxury and to splurge it wasn't the best.  But, it may have what you are looking for.<br />Also, the format of this book is divided into sections of the country and then the various lodging, restaurants etc.... but it has very long descriptions and small print and was too much information for us at the time.<br />Actually, we did not take this book with us to Australia and we purchased a few other books instead (Fodors, Sydney Citiguide).  I truly found that in the era of the internet, I could research most of the trip online and make a lot of the reservations.  And as far as having a reference while you are away.... the more site specific the book the more useful I have found.  (And my husband sold ours on e-bay before we even left for the trip!)	2004-01-25

As is typical with any Nicholas Sparks novel, you are bound to find love so strong and then grieve as it is taken away.  Well, Nights in Rodanthe is no exception to this rule.  Sparks weaves the present day with the past telling a story about love, divorce, pain, loss, and learning to live again.<br />  After the tragedy of the book is revealed, the main character is still happier &quot;to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.&quot;  It is an amazing message and one in which I hope each reader can remember to take each day with loved ones as a gift and appreciate them, because we are all lucky to have that chance to love too.	2004-01-25

It divided the city into the various regions and had what there was to see and do in each area.  It was a great fast reference tool for activities and places to see.<br />  If you are using this guide for hotel and restaurant info, that is where it is a bit lacking and I would refer you to another book or to the fodors.com website where on the message boards you can ask Australians or prior travelers about first hand experiences.<br />  Truly a guide to what there is to see and do when in Sydney!

It had a good deal of information and also great website addresses for me to search for more information.  Since it became useful, I did purchase a copy which we took with us on our honeymoon.<br />  We went to Sydney and the Great Barrier Reef areas and this book helped us with ideas of things to see and do and more options on lodging.  On the planes in between our destinations, we would read what places there were to see and activities to do and then we discussed where we had to go and what we read about that didn't seem interesting to us.<br />  Also, I would refer anyone to fodors.com before they travel anywhere because on their message boards you can ask Australians and past travelers about anything you can think of and not have to search any book.  That was truly the most useful planning tool.<br />  All-in-all, not a bad choice as a guide for all of Australia and it gave a good deal of information about where we were going, but for specific city information...get online!	2004-01-25

I knew not to expect the typical lawyer tale, but I could not get into this book.  For me it did not have the substance that I was seeking.  I was frankly bored by the tale of the mountain-people coming to town to help the farmers.  It just did not have mystery, suspense, romance or anything captivating to me.<br />If you like this kind of story, I guess it is good for what it is, but it definately wasn't for me.  If I had skipped ahead and read the last chapter, I probably would have quit the book less than half way through.<br />Sorry, but I just didn't like the story!	2004-01-18

Well, I was in Australia at Lizard Island Resort in the Great Barrier Reef and I was badly sunburned.  My husband and I checked out the resort's library where everyone could donate or borrow books and I found a copy of this one!<br />I really enjoyed this book and had a tough time putting it down when I had time to read.  Sparks grabbed my attention in the beginning of the book with a very sad beginning and the mention of a dog coming into the story.<br />In typical fashion, it becomes a love story.  There is a handsome stranger and a guy who was her husband's best friend.  We all wonder who she will choose.  This book was different than Spark's others as one of the suitors is not as trustworthy as he seems and our heroine and her hero get wrapped up in a bit of a mystery.<br />I thought it was a captivating novel.  I wanted to see where the story would lead from the beginnning.  I would highly recommend this book....I don't feel like it has the more typical tragic ending Spark's books often have....but definately worth reading!	2004-01-18

Neely Crenshaw was not a lovable character since I really did not think he was well developed.<br />This was a story of the players all reminiscing, but it was supposed to really be a story of self discovery for Crenshaw and show how he was finally able to wrap up that era of his life and move on.  But, I felt like this book came up short.  It just didn't have any magic or spark.<br />I am a sports fan, not necessarily a football fan and I found the ten or so pages devoted to play-by-play and player commentary on a game to be a complete bore.  It did not add anything to the story, in my opinion.<br />Move on and try another football or Grisham book.  You can skip this one!	2004-01-18

I originally bought this book from amazon when I first got engaged.  My fiance and I are both jewish and have been to many many jewish weddings, but I wanted to learn more.  So, I found this book because of all the glowing reviews!  And I would like to add another one!<br />     As I said in the title, I read it once and since I kept telling my fiance little tidbits that I didn't know or things that were interesting, he asked to borrow the book.  After his first reading he said that he wanted to review certain sections, highlight them and then pass this book onto his mother!<br />     I really found Diamant's book to be greatly inspiring and full of explainations on what parts are necessary in a jewish ceremony and what parts are customs and why.  She really appeals to a large audience because she does not assume you have to be orthodox to understand or take part in anything she discusses.  This book has also inspired me to have a Friday night \\"Sabbath\\" dinner with close family before our wedding and integrate some rituals I didn't know about previously, like both mothers breaking a plate.  (Read the book to find out what it means!)<br />     And since I am having a long engagement, I am going to have to refresh my memory soon because when I read it I just remember saying out loud \\"Oh, that is so cool!  I want that to happen during my ceremony too!\\"<br />BUY THIS BOOK! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!	2003-03-14

I find that for my titling on my scrapbook pages and on the guestbook/scrapbook pages I am creating for my wedding, I needed some creative inspiration and needed to expand my lettering.  This book has a huge amount of lettering styles (Some of which I love and some I know I'll never use) The best part about this book in particular is that it shows the alphabet on one page in color and then the opposing page has color example scrapbook pages illustrating their use.  (And it can inspire your pages as well)<br />If you enjoy lettering and want to expand your horizions or if you are a beginner I would suggest this book be in your library.  I have definately used it when I am stuck, in a rut, or want to try something new and different!	2003-03-14

I am sure that at some point I have read other Jayne Ann Krentz books, but I definately enjoyed this one.  Let me give a short synopsis.<br />     At first we meet Charity Truitt who is a powerful corporate person and right away she shows that she is burnt out and has a breakdown.  She settles into a small town and owns a small shop which she is very content with. A gentleman, Elias Winter, who we learn was also an important corporate person, moves into Washington's Whispering Waters Cove.  Everyone mistrusts Elias' motives including Charity.  But, Elias is a novice when it comes to relationships and Charity has been repulsed by former boyfriends...so they meet.<br />     There is some suspense and a mystery involved in the plot of the book as well as a wonderful romantic tale.  This novel was fun to read and I would recommend it to anyone who likes more to a romance novel than just boy meets girl and they end up in bed.	2002-04-09

I actually found myself laughing at some of the dialogue and I really enjoyed the characters she created. <br />     Since you can read other reviews to find out more about the plot line I'll give the basics.  Sloan Reynolds is the main character who happens to be a beautiful police woman.  Her father whom she has never known calls her and invites her to Palm Beach for two weeks to get to know the family.  Sloan debates about it and decides to go.  What follows is a story about getting to know a long lost sister, falling in love and being involved in an FBI investigation.  <br />     The chapters went by very quickly and I hated to put it down to go to sleep.  I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and would definately love to read another book by Judith McNaught.... especially if it is true that the other reviewers seem to think.. that this isn't her best because it was still very entertaining.	2002-03-08

I loved reading the short essays and stories about various aspects about Jewish life.  It was enjoyable to read stories containing all the Yiddish words that I grew up listening to and understanding.  This is a book that you should read one or two stories at a time and then think about what you read to get the full feelings of the stories.

I found quotes that were inspiring, romantic, and helped put an interesting spin on life and certain circumstances.  I found this book, picked it up and had to buy it.  There were just so many quotes that I liked and could identify with or aspire to, but I couldn't possibly copy all of them in my own quote book.  So, this is a welcome addition to my fascination with quotes.  And I really enjoy the fact that the quoted individuals range from Confucious to Joe Namath...it provides an interesting perspective. <br />     If you enjoy reading tidbits on happiness, attitude, dreams, forgiveness, success, overcoming obstacles and more then this would be a book to pick up.  Otherwise, leave it for someone else to appreciate.	2002-03-02

The main character Jo Becker lives in a beautiful farmhouse with her minister husband and three almost grown children.  She loves animals and is a veterinarian.  One day a dog is brought to her office which leads her to discover a link to her past... the owner of the dog.  She tells about running away from her first marriage and leading a bohemian lifestyle until one of her roommates was brutally murdered.<br />     I just did not find this character very interesting, didn't really care why she kept running away from things and didn't care about who committed the murder.  I don't think there was a lot in the book for me to connect to...<br />     Overall, I still think I would give another novel by Sue Miller a chance, but I'd pass on this one.  It just wasn't all that interesting.	2002-03-01

Instead, I was reminded more of Nicholas Sparks who wrote The Notebook, Message in a Bottle and others.  And I found myself truly amazed by this book.  So much so that I finished reading it the same night I started it.<br />     James Patterson divides the book up into sections on Katie and The Diary.  We first meet Katie who is a likeable woman who in completely in love with her boyfriend and the man of her dreams who breaks her heart by breaking up with her instead of giving her the diamond ring she believed was coming.   Matt had given her a diary to read from Suzanne writing to Nicholas.  After reading the entire book, the reader gets to see and feel how life had unravelled and we get to understand who Matt is and where he comes from emotionally.  This is not just a story about Katie and Matt, but also of Suzanne and Nicholas.<br />     I felt as though James Patterson's background in suspense novels helped this story because there are many different layers that he chooses to withhold until the reader is ready.  What I mean is that despite the love story there are a few twists and turns and piecing together of information until finally you can put all the pieces together.<br />     If you enjoy reading Nicholas Sparks' novels, then you should not miss this book, but if you are expecting a typical suspense mystery thriller....keep looking.  For what he intended to do with this novel, he succeeded.  (And I hope he writes more!)	2002-02-06

If you don't know who detective Alex Cross is, that's okay.  If you like mystery novels that keep you guessing and turning the pages, then this may be the book and the author for you.<br />     From experience I have learned that it is always good to start at the beginning of a series and not the middle or the end, but in the case of James Patterson and his character Alex Cross, I started somewhere in the middle and keep hopping around.  Each time I worry that I have forgotten who Alex Cross is, but there are always tidbits about him that remind me.  Also, the stories in the series are totally stand alone stories that just so happened to this one guy and his partner.<br />     Alex Cross is in love with his girlfriend Christine and his world is coming together.  She is afraid that his work is too dangerous and is apprehensive of marrying him.  Alex is working on multiple murders in Washington D.C. which to most don't appear to have a pattern or particular link.  But Alex is determined to find the connection.  This leads him to pursue a British diplomat named Geoffrey Shafer and the story that ensues has twists and turns in the pursuit of bringing to justice the one who has become nicknamed the Weasel.<br />     This was a good story if you have never read another novel by James Patterson or even one in his Alex Cross series.  Like most of his work, the chapters are very short which keep to turning pages and saying...just one more chapter before bedtime.  If you already enjoy other James Patterson novels, this is not one to miss.	2002-01-29

I have bought a lot of papers, scissors and other assorted items, but I have always looked for a book that could give me some tips I didn't know or couldn't figure out.<br />     This is the first Idiot's guide that I have read and in my opinion it is the best guide for beginners and some more advanced scrapbookers alike.  I thought that one of the best parts of the book were the little blurbs in the margins like &quot;Anecdotes from the archives&quot;, &quot;Shortcuts&quot;, &quot;Sticky Points&quot;, and &quot;Words for Posterity&quot;.  They made it easy to skim through some sections of the book.<br />     Smedley also includes some anecdotes from her personal experience which enhance the book.  But as a more experienced scrapbooker who has discovered many of these techniques through trial and error, I found the chapter on Color and using the color wheel to your advantage to be of great use.  Other chapters discuss and explain the language that is used, what supplies to purchase, getting started with journaling and saving souvenirs, creating scrapbooks with kids, capturing special moments in a special scrapbook, and shows a few examples of layouts.<br />     One of the things I have discovered is that whatever layout or size scrapbook you choose to use, is that you find a way to personalize your pages.  I sometimes feel like some of the scrapbook pages in the magazines and books are copies of each other and look somewhat mass manufactured.  I like to take pride in doing my own lettering and making every page different.<br />     All in all, this was the most helpful guide I have found for the person who wants to get into scrapbooking, but is not sure how to go about it.  Most of the other books I have browsed through gave either sample layouts to copy or focused on heirloom preservation, but not what I wanted to learn.  If you are just starting out or just wantto pick up some quick tips, please consider picking up this book.	2001-09-11

I didn't really know what to expect, however most of the way through I figured out that Sparks seems to have a knack for the romantic, yet tragic love story. <br />     This begins with an older man recalling a year of his life that he will never forget.  Basically, Landon Carter is the typical senior in high school.  He is applying to college and trying to figure out a way to cruise through the year.  Also, he is the typical teenager who is worried about his appearance in front of his friends.  Somehow, Landon befriends Jamie Sullivan who is the daughter of the town's Baptist minister and a conservative Christian girl.  Through the course of the school year, they fall in love as we get to know more about Landon and Jamie and see how these opposites attract.  Jamie changes Landon's life forever and he is never the same person.  If I say anymore about the plot, I will totally give it away and then you won't need to read it....so that's all I can tell you about the story.<br />     This book was refreshing because it was truly romantic because Jamie and Landon only share a few kisses and hand holding.  I am very used to any romantic book somehow culminating in some sexual activity, but this book was even better because it didn't.  <br />     It would make it a great book for a teenager for many reasons.  The great morals in respect to showing &quot;love&quot;, the fact that everyone has something to offer even if they are different and showing what some of the important things are in life.<br />     I would definately recommend reading this book, but I still think that even if you don't enjoy this one, check out some of Sparks' other novels for more tragic love stories!	2001-09-11

I did find a copy of it to flip through in a local bookstore and I liked what I saw.  Since I am considering teaching as a second career, I have been told taking the PRAXIS is my next step so I had to start somewhere.<br />     First, it includes an intro to commonly asked questions and strategies.  Then it moves on to analyzing the three exam areas and gives may hints as well as specific sample test questions.  My favorite part is that it has a Mathematics review complete with pre-test and then review of the specific areas with arithmetic, algebra and geometry which I can use since I am very rusty. It reviews grammar and useage which brought out some good tips.  It also included sample essay writing questions and 3 full length tests.  <br />     Since I am often a procrastinator, I particularly liked the study guide check off list which I think has helped me stay on course.  <br />     This guide had a small section on the CBT so I am probably going to get something else to supplement that area, but I think overall this is a great way to start studying.	2001-09-06

I actually read it in one sitting and this was the first book that made me cry while reading it.  <br />     This is an amazing love story about a love that is lost and then found again.  As the characters age, Allison and Noah are both in a nursing home and Allison has lost her memory, but every day Noah walks down the hallway to her room to retell the story of their love.  <br />     &quot;The Notebook&quot; was the first novel by Nicholas Sparks that I read although it wasn't the only one.  I just finished reading &quot;The Rescue&quot; which I also enjoyed and I plan on picking up his other novels as well.<br />     The story made me smile, cry and if you are a romantic at heart that loves to read sappy love stories this book is definately for you.  Also, if you read or saw the movie &quot;Message in A Bottle&quot; and enjoyed it, please read this one.	2001-09-06

I have had my Canon Rebel 2000 for over a year now and I have learned how to experiment and take some decent pictures with my manual modes.  I wanted a book that I could read easily and understand more about my camera and how to enhance my skills.  That is what I found in this book.<br />     This is a great start for a beginner because it talks first about what an SLR is, how to protect it and how to properly handle your camera.  Then it introduces the reader to exposure and shutter speed and aperture in a basic way and progresses to metering, choosing lenses, flash, film selection, filters, accessories and also includes sections on one shot cameras and digital cameras.  It has an amazing about of information in a simplistic to read form.  Also, if you have one question, from the detailed table of contents you can find what you are looking for quickly.<br />     This is not a small pocket size book to take with you, but something to read before and after you go out.  Like most of the other reviewers said, I didn't give it 5 stars because color pictures would have been nice. But, if you supplement this book with some that have color photographs in the more specific area that you are interested in primarily photographing, then it is sufficient.  I recommend the National Geographic Field Guide ( I also found it on a library shelf, took it home and it will be my next purchase!)	2001-08-14

It succeeds in explaining lenses, composition tips, exposure and choosing aperture and shutter speed and a discussion about lenses.  This is all very basic.  Hence if this is the first guide that you pick up it is a good start.  <br />     I had already taken a photography class at the local community college and we discussed and experimented with aperture and shutter speed to help us with exposure.  I found that after this class, I had a good understanding of what to do to manipulate exposure.<br />     I was kind of put off by one thing in particular in this book.  I know that it is put out by Kodak so they are going to endorse their products, however I thought that an entire chapter which is devoted to choosing a film is solely about their film was taking it pretty far.  There are other brands on the market that are different and will produce different coloring.  So, I suggest you try different brands (and speeds) of film to see what you like best.  Fuji has come great films.  And because of this,  I feel as though there are some better guides out there.  <br />     I like that this book has colored photos throughout, however it does not show what settings the photographer used.  That is sometimes just as important as you can learn as an amateur what the pros do.<br />     I have been enjoying the National Geographic Photography Field Guide and see my review on it for details.   And for a great book which covers a lot of ground I would recommend getting The Basic Book of Photography by Grimm.  Their only drawback is that the pictures are in black and white, but the information is clear and easy to access.<br />     Overall, this guide is a very basic overview and I would recommend getting it if you have the interest in photography and you are just starting to understand how to use manual settings.But, think about taking a class or checking out another guide in conjunction with this book by Kodak.	2001-08-14

I read this book cover to cover after first looking at the beautiful color pictures which gave me some inspiration for what I could try to do.  <br />     The book is broken down into specific tips for things you may encounter while on a trip like rainbows, stained glass, landscapes and also general tips at the end.  I would say that the information was useful because my pictures were better overall.  I don't know if this is the best travel photography book because I haven't read any others, but I would say that it is definately a solid start.	2001-08-10
US	51319315	RYN4T1WHXY119	0316666009	30029813	1st to Die (Women's Murder Club)	Books	4	9	10	N	N	A page turner	I just finished this book in two days and I really enjoyed it.  James Patterson is the master of twisting the ending of his books and knowing this I kept trying to figure out who did it the entire time.  I think I actually figured it out a few pages before everyone else.<br />     You are pulled in to the story from the beginning when two newlyweds are murdered in cold blood hours after the ceremony.  You wonder who would do a thing like this.  But, it gets worse, of course with 3 newlywed couples murdered and everyone is left to try to piece the puzzle together.  <br />     The main character is a woman which I think makes this book very interesting having been written by a man.  It was definately a change from the Alex Cross era, but I think it was a good one.  I liked the characters and I can't wait to see what happens from here.<br />     All-in-all, I definately would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys reading James Patteson novels, but also to anyone who likes a good mystery, with a hint of romance, and can deal with the gore of multiple murders.	2001-07-26

I just came back from a wonderful trip to Barcelona, Spain and one of the most memorable dinners that we had was lobster paella. I couldn't wait to see if there were recipes for paella out there to experiment with. And this book by Penelope Casas is wonderful.<br /> She gives recipes for a variety of different paella dishes from fish to chicken to meat to seafoods... you can take you pick. This was extremely important to me as my boyfriend is allergic to clams, but just loves rice which is the base of this amazing dish.<br /> I have been able to scout out the ingredients such as the arborio rice and saffron at the grocery store since I wasn't sure I could find them. I still do not have a paella pan yet, but I can't wait to get one and try out these recipes. They sound delicious and Penelope Casas' descriptions are very easy to understand and visualize while you read. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Thank you for this great book.	2001-07-17

I started reading it on the way home and after two planes and a 5 hour delay in the middle, I easily finished this book in one day.  This was a great book to have with me because it was really a page turner and helped to quickly pass the time.  One thing I think Stuart Woods does well is put several twists into his books which made me look up and say &quot;No way!&quot; throughout this book.<br />     The main character is Wolf Willet who we get to know in the start as a guy who likes his routine and has made a large amount of money in the entertainment business.  In the beginning he flies from Sante Fe on his way to LA and has plane troubles and lands near the Grand Canyon.  He reads the NY Times headline which says that his wife, his best friend, and him are found shot dead at his home in a guest bedroom.  Through the entire rest of the book, Wolf continues to find out who the killer and the dead people really are.  You are introduced to many characters who you consistently question...who do you really trust?  <br />     This was a great mystery by Stuart Woods and I would definately recommend it to anyone!	2001-07-05

I received this book as a birthday present and from the first few glances, I was intrigued.  I have read many Oriole books in the past, but none that really told me what had happened.  You see, I am 27 now and the first thing I can remember is winning the world series in 1983.  So, there is about 300 pages of stories and information that are totally new to me.  From the standpoint of a fan who wants to learn more about how the Orioles became what they are in Baltimore this was a very interesting book.  <br />     John Eisenberg gives a list of the players he interviewed and a short two lines about them.  This was extremely useful to me and I refered back to it often.  As the previous reviewer said, I was surprised that Chuck Thompson and also John Miller were not included in the interviewed group, but I'm sure Eisenberg couldn't interview everyone.<br />     From an Oriole's fan perspective, this was an interesting book to read, to learn about how the team got to Baltimore and the different phases of development to the present team.  If these things don't interest you then definately skip this book.  But I found it to be quite interesting and truly enhanced by the short blurbs from the people who Eisenberg interviewed.	2001-06-10

It is definately not her best, but it was a nice quick book to read.  I found that I was pretty interested in the story because unfortunately there are many incidences of infidelity in the world today.           Basically we start out with Jill Plumley who is the second wife of David.  She is approached at a company picnic by a younger pretty girl named Nicole who says that she is going to steal David away from Jill.  Well, with that remark the tale begins.             Jill had been a previously strong woman with a great career who fell in love with a married man and got him for her own.  It tells about her insecurities to keep him and flashes back to their affair.  And as in real life all too often, once a cheater, definately don't count him out to do it again.  The only thing left is for Jill to decide what to do next. <br />     This was an easily read book, but by far not her best.	2001-05-12

It was during my research for the trip that I came upon Gaudi and the architectural influence that he had on the city of Barcelona.  I actually purchased the book before I went on vacation but I wanted to read it afterwards.  From the intimate details that discuss the life of Gaudi and all the information I received on my trip from guided tours of the Sagrada Familia, La Pedrera (Casa Mila), and Guell Park, I have an amazing appreciation for Gaudi.<br />     Also, the pictures in this book are excellent and are much more detailed than the ones that I was able to take.  They make a great addition to my visual explanations of my trip.<br />     I would recommend this book if either you are going to Barcelona, or have been there.  But I would also think that it would be good for someone who is just interested in architecture or the history of someone who changed the face of Barcelona permanently.	2001-04-11

I purchased this book when I knew I was taking a trip to Spain but I was trying to find a way to decide between Madrid and Barcelona.  I found all the information extremely useful.   Eventually we decided to go to Barcelona and took the guide along since it seemed as though we would refer to it often.<br />     This book had a section devoted to Barcelona and separate areas devoted to the hotels and restaurants.  I particularily liked the fact that they devoted a whole 2 page spread to a particular site to see with close up photos and some detailed explanations.  After visitng a few of the sites, I came back to the hotel room and re-read the description and it gave me a greater appreciation for what I had seen.  Also, the hand drawn 3D maps were very useful for me as a very visual person because they helped me gain a greater sense of direction.  The descriptions of the various points of interest were very helpful and contained a lot of information along with street address, phone number and hours of operation.  At the end of the section were a few maps which were also very simple and had various important landmarks throughout.<br />     Walking down the stretch of road in Barcelona known as La Rambla, you would see many newspaper stands and they always had Eyewitness guidebooks to sell as well.  Also, I saw many tourists carrying this book as their guide in many different languages.  Since this book was all about all of Spain,  I would probably recommend picking up the specific Barcelona and Catalonia edition if you are interested in visiting the particular area.  But all in all I really enjoyed this book.  It was definately stronger in the attractions and things to see area and a bit weaker with hotel and restaurant recommendations.	2001-04-08

Unfortunately this particular guide was utterly useless.  It mentioned everything in broad terms and gave no particular information for the traveler.  It was a good thing that I happened to buy other travel guides before I left although in Barcelona along with newpaper stands everywhere they sold guidebooks.  It seems that the most popular guide book is actually Eyewitness Travel Guides Barcelona and Catalonia.  I had purchased the Eyewitness Travel Guide on Spain and found that even though the section on Barcelona was small it was extremely helpful with diagrams, descriptions and small easy to understand maps.  <br />     This Michelin guide has listed only a very few restaurants in Barcelona which is quite disappointing since there are a gizillion very good ones.  Overall, this guide gave a very broad overview and oversimplified what there is to see and do in Barcelona and is really not particularily useful for the traveler.  Get a book that is more specific!	2001-04-08

First of all I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed my experience in Barcelona and would recommend the city to any visitors.  But definately be very aware that pick pocketing is an industry there so don't carry anything visible with you and use all safety precautions.         Now, this particular guide was pretty useful to me and my boyfriend during our trip.  The way that the book is organized is into sections on Things to Know, Hotels, Restaurants, Nights Out, Sights, Excursions, Shops, and Maps.  Within each of these sections it is further broken down into the specific areas of the city.  Within the areas, they discuss a few possibilities for eating etc. (about 6 or so with good descriptions)   On each opposing page it includes a small square map with colored dots allowing you to see where the particular restaurant you are going to is near which shopping stores.   This organization took some getting used to, but it was generally helpful.<br />     The main reason why we bought this guide was for the maps at the end which were very useful in determining where we were going.  This guide provided a good amount of information without being overwhelming.  However I would still also recommend that you purchase other guides in addition to it as it was not very all inclusive.	2001-04-08
US	51319315	RAZ8EKJUFRV08	0345300203	400295650	The Outside Man	Books	3	11	14	N	N	A lot of twists and turns	This book is the first one that I read by Richard North Patterson and I will definately look to read more.  In this book we are immediately faced with a murder and the main character Adam Shaw who finds the body.  Shaw also becomes the man on the quest to find out who murdered the wife of his best friend.  <br />     This book involved many characters and many plot twists.  Just as you and Adam Shaw think that you have figured out who the murderer is, you are proved wrong.  This book is masterfully crafted.   Towards the conclusion of the book, when you learn what exactly transpired it gets slightly confusing, but if you slow down it will make sense.  I think it would be better enjoyed if you have a few long sittings to read it, rather than what I did with about 15 minutes a night since that made it tougher to have consistency.<br />     All-in-all, this was a suspenseful thriller which I would recommend that you should read.  And if you don't choose this particular book by Richard North Patterson, find another by him.  I definately will keep reading his books.	2001-01-22

Throughout college, everyone knew that if the class was taught by him we would all have an easy time understanding all of the concepts.  He was a great teacher who really knew how to explain even the more difficult topics and pharmacology was no exception.            This textbook was extrememly useful as it not only explains what types of drugs have specific effects on the body and it's systems, but it is particularly detailed in describing the impact that the drugs may have on rehab.  Even in class, this was one aspect that he reinforced.  He explained that the reason for talking about certain classes of drugs and then giving a few examples is because the drug world is always changing and so are the names.  This way he has provided a wealth of knowledge and in a very easy to understand manner.<br />     I have been out of school for about 3 years and I still occassionally refer to this book when encountering some classes of drugs and this is a great reference to have.  I would highly recommend this text to anyone, that is especially if you can't be in one of his classes.	2000-11-01

I work as a physical therapist in an acute setting where all of my patients are elderly.  I have never refered to this book.  It has a few good chapters to read and can supplement any learning that has occurred in the classroom, but overall is not a necessary text.	2000-10-31

It did a pretty good job of simplistically explaining the role of the heart and lungs in health and what happens (technically) when problems arise.  This was a good reference book for hardcore scientific facts and it is specifically targeted at the rehabilitation disciplines.  If that is what you are looking for, this book will be the one you need.	2000-10-31

It's organized into body parts as it's chapters and then discusses the anatomy, physiology, special tests etc. that is needed for evaluation.  I had to buy this book as a required text for school, but I have hardly ever cracked it opened.  If you are in need of a good ortho text I would recommend the Magee book as a reference, since this one is just ok.	2000-10-31

I found it very helpful since it is full of ideas for treatment and exercises for some different diagnoses.  Of course, I used it a lot in school in a few courses, it was invaluable in the clinic when I was doing a lot of outpatient orthopaedic patients.  Since I am now doing inpatient acute patients I have rarely used this book, but I still have it as a reference because you never know when it may be useful to brush up on.  I recommend that you get this book if you are in school or think that clinical ortho patients are your niche.	2000-10-29

I constantly used it as a source of information, until I became comfortable with measuring joint range of motion. Since I am now working in the inpatient arena, I mostly repeatedly measure knees, but refer back to it when I need to brush up on another joint.  It has clear pictures and overall is a great reference book for anyone who has to evaluate joint ranges of motion.	2000-10-29

This book centers around an ex-police officer/lawyer Stone Barrington who seems to be quite the ladies man while doing investigative work.  He is hired by Amanda who is a lady that travels in the celebrity gossip world.  She has been the target of a widely circulated fax about her &quot;Dirt&quot;.  It is an interesting read, and Woods manages to weave all of the characters and plots together well.  However, he involved so many characters that I started to get more confused towards the end.  It is an entertaining book which does not require much brain power to absorb.  And the chapters are pretty short so it makes for a very quick read.  Not bad, but not excellent either.	2000-10-26
