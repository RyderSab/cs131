I was hoping some technical and artistic explanations in judging the musical piece but all I perceived was a verbal description of the music that you could explain to someone how the symphony was performed. Violins followed by clavier than picolos etc,etc. So at the end I did not know any more than listening the actual piece and confirming the authors arguments that indeed clavier follows violins.

We must remember that those Barbary fighters were fighting to claim a land and sea territory as everybody else, like British or French. Who ever was to challenge them, had to take a fight with them or submit to them by paying tributes, not to an individual but to the Sultan or Governor. In return they would get trading rights within their  claimed territory. Let us not forget that, they go back to 15th century when each and every nation was fighting for more territorial rights. Barbary fighters was part of a loose army under the control of the local Sultan. They were open to fight or make peace agreements. The war of 1803-5 was about not recognizing their territorial claims (contrary to as British and French did for their own reasons) and it was about to take a fight with them. It was all about money and trade with lucrative North Africa cities and not about terrorism. If you had British or French flag where there was trade agreements, you were safe to sail and trade otherwise you were enemy. It was your choice to trade with them or sail through their claimed territory. They were not sneaking onto you as terrorist. <BR>Real terrorism was actually happening somewhere else where the slave trade was flourishing between Africa and America and yet nobody was really acting on it to stop it.<BR>Contrary to Barbary fighters, who were protecting their territorial claims, right or wrong, but it was territorial, there were pirates from European countries that were attacking even to their own ships for material gain like bandits. Although I disagree, you could call those terrorist but even the European pirates were not fighting for political or religious purposes.<br />Bottom line is that it was not about a fight against terrorism but rather a fight for National Interests.<BR>Do not we have similar disputes now like who can fish where? Who can fly where?<BR>War was legitimate for both parties from their individual National Interest point of view and if any country or a group comes against those interests than it is a Darwinian world, stronger wins but let us not dilute the issue.	2003-08-20

It is a combination History book and paintings. It tells yo that for example Boticelli's Birth of Venus is first in Ronecance for nudity but it does not tell me why her feet is crooked, why anybody else who probably did similar paintings at the same time did not get this much fame.

Yes Ottomans did not use the name Istanbul for they were not a nation Empire and they did not change the name when they took the city Istanbul but since the introduction of concept &quot;nationalism&quot; into Ottoman Empire by foreign countries within last 150 years, the name was changed to Istanbul like it or not.

Most of the situations are explained with reasons why the charts are showing certain forms but there are also some situations that author does not explain why the chart has the shape that it has, so you just have to take it as is. I learned a lot of tips from the book. Once you start reading it ,it is difficult to put it aside. It is so smooth. There is not much theory in the book, i.e no electrical theory. If you do not have background from physiology books, even though you may be able to read the charts you may not be able to understand physics behind it, in other words this is not a full substitute for Physiology subject.

We all know that Islam accepts Christianity and judaism as legitimate religions to have same stories dd not suprise me. Second part about certain statements that commentators disagreed about their meanings and authors provide their own interpretation adding to pool some more. Nothing is new all commentators agrees that there are certain things that are interpreted differently. The last section is sections from Bell's Intrioduction to Kur'an. Book has a very good list of sources, of course each of them has their own biases.

By itself the book is very clear in explaning cardiac cycles and rest of the hemodynamics. Hearth sounds forget it, ECG or ECG graphs, forget it but whatever is explained is explained in easy terms whit some nice diagrams/figures.It is expensive book per page compared to physiology book.	2002-09-27

It covers most common pathologies instead of very rare academic cases.It is a practical book with very good pictures. There are a lot of good quality pictures to help to recognize cases. Explanations are short but to the point. You should not expect to find all the voluminuous information that you may find in other standard pathology books but you learn more practical things from this book.

Common pathologies of each system or organ is described sometimes with nice colored pictures. Explanations are very simple and easy to understand.

Ibn Al-Arabi in this first book explains the mystical concepts or rather mystical interpretations of the purification ritual. For every rule he describes what each school required and than puts forward his position and defends it both in inner and outer meaning. I found the explanations on comperative part of the rituals a littel weak and short. I believe for comperative studies and to get better understanding of the reasonings behind each school of thoughts, Ibn Rushd's book to be a better source. For the student of mystism certainly this is a must read book.	2002-08-10

He is trying to identify what he calls kul/harem  and agricultural serfdom with slavery in the West. He never compares the conditions of the slaves in the west with his classification of slaves in Ottoman Empire, kul/harem subjects, what I call \\"adopted persons\\" or \\"willing to serve for better future\\" like  volunteers in government offices or adoptive children. He can not count more than two digit persons as \\"slaves\\" in the Ottoman Empire while in the west it goes up to millions. He does not compare the conditions of the slaves in the west with conditions of those kul/harem that is far better than most of the Ottoman subjects. He does not see the difference that agricultural servants in Ottoman Empire were kick out by the Russians from Russia yet those in the West were captured. Although he states that most of the families were racing to give away their sons and daughters to so called slavery in Ottoman Empire yet in the West they were hunted. He concludes that lack of study of slavery in Muslim countries is due to political correctness in the west, which is a joke when they make all kinds of studies to tear apart the Holy Qur'an. In summary the information is correct for they can be verified from sources but I totally disagree with the conclusion and especially that there is a cover up.	2002-07-23

It is very nicely written diary but he only talks about buildings, seremonies, breakfast and dinner and parties. He does not provide his impressions except in very few instances. He does not tell us what he found interesting or different. He is impressed with the sizes of buildings but he does not say what he found different in them. In this respect I found the book \\"Muslim Discovery of Europa\\" more entertaining and illuminating. Apparently he found man and especially woman of europe very beatiful for he keeps mentioning of it otherwise he does not say much the social life etc. He is not suprized to see people dressed and acted differently. He is not a good observer of technological and military power of europa.In summary it is an interesting book to read. If you have seen the cities or places than you can see how vivid and precise he describes them. I guess he just did not have contact with common people. I guess if he had good contact with people than he could write interesting things about their life. I enjoyed reading the book abd recommend it.	2002-07-14

It is based on original accounts such as Ibn Ishak, Wakidi Tabari, etc. What I found best in this one is that the writing is smooth to read. When you read Tabari, Ibn Kathir, Ibn Hisham etc, every statement starts with chain of transmitters to validate the truth as it was custom than and you loose the track of the subject. Unless you are making a resarch in the subject itself this book summarizes all the narratives from different sources and gives you all under one cover. What is missing is more information regarding pre-islamic Arabia, I think Peters book is better for that purpose. Chapters are very short giving you breaks as often as you wish to take without loosing the flow. If you want to read one book read this one.	2002-01-30

How sort of snubbery of a people puts the nations back in science and technology. One can still see the remnants of those ideas in populations of current nations. The story is basically mostly about the Ottomans although limited information is given from other muslim countries.It is about their impressions and value judgements on behavior of Europians. How they reacted what others or so called \\"inferiors\\" were doing. How they laughed at on things that eventually haunted them. It is still true, you can not find any study in those countries about Christianity. This is a good reading for people from Middle east for there are a lot of explanations why Middle East is left behind in the race.Scenes that are transmitted from original sources asre very vivid.	2002-01-24

It is not about any certain Jew or famous personalities. Whole story is in general terms. I found the history during the early periods of the Islam very short and on the surface. Key relationships were not elaborated.Most of the information, may be because of availability of the sources was regarding the Jewish community in Ottoman Lands around 15 to 17th centruries. Information about the Jews in other countries is almost non existent but impression was given to make an opinion that it was not as good. There is a section in the book that talks about paralells between Judaism, their way of life and Islam to imply that Islam simply is an extention of Judaism but I find no correlation between their life in muslim countries which the book is supposed to be about and their religion for Muslims did not differentiate Christians or jews, they were both considred monotheist.Over all it is an easy reading but not satisfying for me for it lacked systematic and concrete points.	2002-01-17

I would say that the book is divided into mainly two sections, Cell structure and DANA, DANA replications etc. Second part takes almost two thirds of the book. I would prefer to read other Gene books when it comes to that point but for the cell structure, it is not bad. Some colored pictures, computer animations makes it easy to visualize things. Sections called &quot;experimental pathways&quot; scattered throughout the text takes you into current issues related to the subject.

It starts with short biography of Dr.Nasr, mostly his activities written by him. It sounds a liitel strange when he praises himself but what is the difference if it is the truth. Main part of the book is various themas of his Perennial Philosophy. Each scholar has taken some aspects of his writings or known beliefs and either commented on it, supported it or tried to negate it. After each such writing, Dr. Nast has responded and gave his defence or clarifications on the issues that might have been mis represented or mis understood. This book is a quick and short way into his philosophy for lazy minds. Rather than reading his book &quot;Knowledge and Sacred&quot;, you can read this book and get the whole idea. In his theory of Transendental Unity of Religions it sounds like he is building on the ayat that says similar to each man is born with a concept of God. Theory seems to be long strech and depends on definition of Religion. Besides the philosophy itself this book is worth to read for someone interested in unity of religions and view of contemporary Islamic scholar on philosphy of religion. One thing is important that you need to read this book with symbolism and mystisism in mind and in the context of the subject than you understand what he is saying, otherwise you could get crooked interpretations. One of the writers in the book had a wrong understanding about his statement about modern world and Mr. Nasr has given a good answer to it.	2001-11-19

I wonder how he found the time to be everywhere for everybody. It starts quickly with quanta idea and that goes into the administrative acts, institutions, academies he established and became a director. His dilemmas during the Nazi regime and his hopes that eventually people will come to right way and considerations that these are transitional times. Meanwhile it looks like he was willing to separate people into groups valuable and worthless, interesting, no wonder Einstein never forgave him. I did not find the book fluent. It was jumping all over with a lot of institution names and dates and persons, sort of broken in pieces.	2001-11-12

First half of the book is Vector Analysis and other half is mixture of transformations and Tensor analysis. It covers a lot and has examples for each concept. What I did not like was that the concepts were introduced from general to particular. So if you are not exposed to Vector or Tensor analysis, it is not easy to follow a new concept defined on n-dimensional space and see application on two dimensional space.So it was a good refresher with some applications to Physics but for new starter it is difficult especially for self lerner. Also definitions were very abstract, dry without any meaning attached to it. I can not considered this book as a course book by itself.	2001-11-12

Most important things in the history of Islam is highlighted with articulated feelings by the author. There are sections that I would disagree with the author such as Muslims approval of a tyranical government etc, but very nice book. References are given from Holy Qur'an but there are also other statements that could be supported more strongly rather than stating them. <BR>You feel a lot spirutialty in the book as you read it and comparisons are also given from other religions.	2001-10-29

Author provides very detailed information about the life on board of the train, living quarters, conditions. This takes about half of the book. Than he describes each route. I found this part very short, for my purpose was to know what kind of cities or sceneries I would expecte to see or where to get off the train for a day or two. So for that reason I was a littel dissapointed.But the TV shows gives you some information anyway. So this book was more valuable for life in train.	2001-10-21

Known experiences, double slit, EPR, Stern-Gerlach,Bell theorem and experimental proof are all in there with much more simplified terms than any other book.There are cahapters on Bohm' theory with hidden variables and measurement problem. Finally Copenhagen view wins the battle for all other concepts seem to eventually delivers complications. Not that you will learn anything new if you already read some of those things before or that you will learn anything at all if you do not know what the author is talking about but book gives you another point of view in simplified language.

Part I Cell Biology and Cell Chemistry, Part II Biochemistry, Part III, Genetics, Part IV and V developmental biology and physiology. Author is very clear in his explanations and time to time he provides practical examples. If you expect colorful pictures nice photographs this is not for you but good information is there together with some good references.

It is an anatomy of a cosmopolitan city.The book is about changing Istanbul in last 100 years with most of the emphasis is given to last 50 years when the real change occured. It is about the strugle between secular city view and traditional or Islamic city view for Istanbul. How the mayors tried to give different images to Istanbul based on their political affiliations. How migration from rural areas into cities specifically into istanbul changed the city, it's image and social structure. Although I have my doubts that those who set the policies had the image of the city in mind or if the result was by product of their policies is questionable but two different views constantly reshaped the city.<BR>The scope also extends much broader areas such as Music,fashion and life.	2001-09-23

Obviously it is all about Prophet Mohammed (PBH). As is standard of the time, all the narratives starts with list of narrations. For some one who is not familiar with who those individuals are, names are very distracting, but they can not be eliminated either for they are reliable for some and unreliable for others. Major highlights are taken from Ibn Ishak or ibn Hashim, so it is difficult to find what new thing you learn from this book if you eliminate late narratives. For me it is a tremendeous gift from translators that made this book available to me in English. Ibn Kathir certainly one of the great scholars in Islam.	2001-09-09

Various constants of Nature such as gravity, speed of light, charge are all explained and major tests are explained with the problems encountered while doing the test.

Methodology is quite new. Authors use a lot of &quot;from this it follows&quot; kind of statements so if you are not comfortable with that kind of short cuts, this book is not for you. Examples are numerous from very different areas but some of them beyond introductory level of Quantum Physics. It will help if you finish the book and come back to read the examples. there are good number of problems at the end of each chapter. Overall I like it because it has a different twist in it. Same story told from a different angle. Mathematical formalism in the average.<BR>For me this is not an introductory book into quantum Mechanics, I prefer Reznicks book but i would not miss to read this book either.	2001-09-04

About more contemporary issues answers are more from current state policies rather than directly from Islam. In other words it sounds like author claiming that the policy of an Islamic Country seems to be Islam's answer to the current issues which may not be correct all the time.

Basically argument goes that women did not have any respect before and during Islam including during Prophet Mohammed (pbh) and only now they started to get some respect. I gues the argumet goes what is Islam and what is women's position in Islam. If you value women's position from Western standards that is a wrong stick to measure with.

Author takes us step by step with Schacht's claims and provides contrary arguments to negate Schacht's assertions on the subject. Although he has made every effort to make the book independent of Schacht's book &quot;Origins:, It is helpful to read both in paralell.Most of the time author has either summarized or replicated Schacht's claims before he attacked them. This book is very helpful in understanding why Schacht is considered as Orientalist, for instead of claiming that Schacht was wrong in this or that as a blanket statement, he proves why he was wrong.	2001-08-14

Author takes from the time of fifth Imam to current day and explains the development of the concept of Vilayat. Various forms of Vilayat is discussed as they are developed in time due to socio-political and theological reasons. Author dwells consifdearly on few major Muctehids, Tusi, Hilli, Mufid and Al-Murtada, with whom all started. The current interpretation by Sabzawari, Burujurdi or Humeyni are not covered with necessary depth. At the end the book has a nice appendix regarding the Khums and whom it belongs. I wish the book was to finalaze more exposition of current conditions and rulings. the concept of Vilayat had too many dimensions and author covers all of them with patient. Time to time you think that you already read that concept in prior paragraph but they all have small nuances depending on their definition. One needs to read very slowly. The best part of the book is that, Author with full patient when he uses a phrase that has a concept associated in it and was covered before repeats same in brackets to remaind readers what it was, so you do not have to refer any dictionary in the back of the book.	2001-07-08

He describes the religion, beliefs and concepts. He provides quotations from Islamic thinkers. sometimes he includes his views. He does not separate if the sources are reliable or not.Areas covered, birth of Prophet(SA), expansion of Islam, Islamic sciences, islamic thinkers, Islamic Theology, Hadith Science, Sufism.There are certainly some statements that are disputed by others but it is not Newton's Physics so that all get the same results. I would not take the book as an absolute source book but rather as a refernce point to help to make up ones mind and go to the referenced sources directly. Book has considerable references for comparison or see the quotations in content. It is not written from the point of a Sufi who has belief in Islam but rather as a Theology.	2001-06-25

Author provides a good history of Physics from Greeks to Quantum Theory. In Quantum theory you feel some Philosophical discussions but otherwise it is a science book and a good one with formulas, schematics like a text book. What I liked most was the excerpts from the original writings as the author was making his point. Paragraph from Newton's, Kepler's , Maxwell's, Bohr's, Bell's writings, all those fellows. It is serious book and requires serious reading. Also there is good references for further readings.	2001-06-20

It is shocking to read those geniousess vacciliatting on some concepts. I trust the author is providing actual data but most interesting was to read that Bohr was thinking about the factor on his Energy states factor and his decision to make it one half to match zero state energy. Mr. Heisenberg through out concepts not knowing what he was saying. This is the impression I got from the readings.Author has ceratinly knows a lot about the theory itself and makes clarifications to the arguments that they were shooting to each other.This book is a gem. This book is not for someone who does not know at least a littel about the theory itself otherwise you miss the story behind the correspondances.Recommend to all who is interested in the development of modern physics.	2001-06-20

Ibn Rushd in this book basically goes over various laws of the Sunni Schools, ie risalat of major imams, Imam Shafii, Imam Maliki, Imam Hanbali and some more. Their differed opinions on some issues or any combination of them. It is not just the difference but most importantly he clarifies why they differed on certain issues and what was their reasonings. Some time he inserts his own opinion. In this book you see how an imam's mind works with the principals of Qura'an, tradition and logic. Perfect book to ponder about.

But I am dissapointed for I had the hope that I will be exposed to samples of technical developments which Quantum Theory provided to us. Instead I got list of very special developments, except Electron Optics, Semiconductors etc. For me what is missing from the book is the clear line where it says that these could not be done if Quantum Theory of Atoms were not to be developed. There are references to Quantum behavior but not clearly stating why that is not and what was the problem with the classical Physics. In general it sounds all like technological limitations. Scanning Microsvcobe based on Quantum tunnelling.The queation comes whay similar method of high intensity field around the impuritioes would provide same information. Bottom line I could not see clear cut line where classical physics would have failed in the development of these apparatus. Some of them are clear, for example quantum conductance, interesting but overall I was not happy with the book or may be I am not knowledgable enough to read between the lines.	2001-06-11

It is the first time I was made aware of this claims or facts. The author shows that the Shia is a response to Sunnis. They did not have a school of their own but when they excluded from the Sunni community, first they dissimulate as a Shaf'i and than started their own school of thought. They did not know in the beginning what they were doing and in time they established and made their own philosophy and all these are due in response to Sunnis. Author provides a lot of short biographical information about the Shia muctehids, quite interesting information. Their acceptance of concensus just to get approved by the majority of community and than their refusal of concencus as part of usul al-fikh. Proof that Imam Cafer Al-Sadiq(as) was not really the founding Imam of the Shiat's. They did not have any school of thought at that time because majority of the community did not have their own school of thought where they would reject the Shiat's because of their belief in Imamate, Mutah etc. Interesting, definetely a must read.	2001-06-10

Author refers to some hadits or ayats that puts restrictions on women as the result of the societies of the times of the past.  There seem to be an inherent claim that you can interpret the Quran with current social conditions. It is disputed issue if the Qur'an can and should be interpreted based on current social conditions. Qur'an clearly requires covering of the women, veil is another issue. Author has concentrated mostly in conditions in Egypt, that is a Muslim country but not necessariliy the only country so the coverage is not balanced. Furthermore there are references as to the behavior of the women in Egypt such as removing the head cover with comment them being coptic and muslim women slowly adapting the same. So is this study about the feminism in Egypt or in Islam or whatever changes were happening in feminist relations were they mostly among the minorities or amongst the majority muslims. I read the book assuming that author was always referring to muslim women but now I am not sure. I wish author could back up her feminist claims with ayats or hadits and prove that the interpretations were wrong. Ms. Lale Baktihar has a nice book with reasonable claims or Ms.Stosswater or Ms.Amina Wadud. I appreciate the effort but I would like to see more reasons for claims unless you read the book as a History of developments well than it is okey	2001-06-05

Author provides considerable statistical data that also proves some claims about the success of some nations, and importance of some subjects etc. Author always identifies individuals with their nationality and I got a feeling that he also has a bias to German Physicists. Neverthelese it is a good Chronological and very lively description of the developments with a lot of references. The book does not get into the details of all the problems, tests, interpretations such as EPR, Aspec or Schro's Cat etc. So if you do not know particular Physical Problems and issues that led into certain theories, you do not get the reasons behind the developments. A lot of History is covered, Theory of Mass, Theory of Electron, Quantum Mechanics, Nuclear Physics, Political relations and influences on subjects and individuals. Atom Bomb, quantum electrodynamics, etc.It is very encylopedical knowledge that may guide you certain subjects if you are intereseted to explore. Author paints a good picture of the socio political conditions of the time. Simply said a lot of Historical Information and if you know physics and problems behind these developments from other sources than this book will be complete.	2001-06-02

As the name suggests it is all about how each school of thought consideres the Islamic law, what is their opinion on certain issues. Of course issues that are not disputed is not covered but only those that are different is covered. Author also provides some explanations behind the opinions. It is very good book for person doing comperative study and for more details you can go back to sources, Shafii's book, Muwatta or others.It is a good book for Imam's in this country where they have to answer to questions coming from variety of muslim groups contrary to in the home country it is more uniform, people are generally in same sect.	2001-05-28

It goes direct into the hearth of the subject without too much Mathematics or formalism. Concepts are described clearly. There are no frills. Written by a person who claims himself not a Physicist or Mathematician and therefore easy on reader. Author starts with background history of foundations, than introduce some operators, I wish they were more clearly defined, &quot;Bracket&quot;'s were not clearly defined. Than comes the interpretation issues, Bohr, Einstain debates, hidden variables. Here I believe littel more elaboration of the debates or rather &quot;thougth experiments&quot; could be expanded more for clarity. A chapter is dedicated to Bell theorem and Aspect experiment, brief but you get the idea. Book is finalized with various aspects of the theory including a short paragraph on arrow of time. Overall it is a good book once started I could not drop the book before finishing it.	2001-05-28

Author provides first a good history of Arabia prior to birth of Prophet where you get a good understanding of the environment, there are a lot of references to old greek, persian and Byzantium historians. Than mostly relying on Ibn Ishak's &quot;Life of Mohammed&quot; the birth and life of Mohammed is written. There are few references to Hadiths that may not necessarily be sahih or reliable but considering that they are muslim sources, author seems to take them as they are. I found this book written very nicely, all key events are described with quotations from the original sources and time to time author makes interpretations or value judgments. I found the ancient history of arabia very useful, provides you perspective and who is who type of information.	2001-05-28

It starts with ancient grreks goes to middel ages, developes with Lebnitz and Newton and finale with modern theory. I am not interested in the Philosophy of History or not in position to allocate prizes to Scientist of the past. From that point of view I believe this book gives you the chronology with a lot of information about some obscure mathematicians who contributed to the field.

There are assumptions that seem to be taken as definite such as closed end cosmolgy, separation of body and soul or mind which is controversial. The idea of soul is mainly built upon collapse of wave function or rather conciousness.  I was intrigued that when a robot tests something it could be registering of both results ie, the wave function does not collapse if it is a robot doing the measurement. there is proof of uniqness of the soul in the creation, that is difficult to comprehend i read it many times but the result is interesting, there goes judea-Christian belief and comes Buddha. It is a book that you should read back and forth many times and contemplate, it is worthed and also read Descrates Error.	2001-05-25

Author dives into Schroedinger's equation and even worse he starts to use a lot &quot;Eigen.****&quot; in the form of value, function, state etc so that you really have to slow down to comprehend clearly. Subject gets deeper and deeper and he himself says similaer to saying &quot;just take it from me as it is correct&quot;. Than provides simple problems and solutions. Although the examples are standard that you find in any introductory course textbooks, the thechincal language he uses makes them difficult to follow. I think this book is not as easy as advertised to be. I do not blame anybody remember after all there is phrase that only few people knows what Quantum Mechanics is. You may want to read this book after reading few more introductory books especially with some formulas and calculations. If you do not know what Eigenvalue is,which author does not even define it, than you better read some calculus before you read this book.	2001-05-19

Too many buildings are covered, old and new buildings together. The general information about the construction date, architectural style is provided but not in detail. It is so grouped that it makes it easy to walk around the town and see good number of buildings in the neighbourhood.

Author also tries to prove that the science of Hadith has started before or at least with the Islam and not like some Orientalists think after 2-300 years of Islam. Author explains the classifications of the Hadiths, Isnads and Hadith writers, their life, how they were teaching and spreading. A lot of references are given to each claim so I suppose the descriptions given are real and not fantasy. Each major Hadith writer is briefly described with littel autobiography. Overall it is more like Historical text rather than techinal or philosophical explanations. There is no mention of hadits from Shia sources so it is stricly Sunni origin. Shia sources are as though non-existent so from this perspectiv I did not find it very objective. There is a nice Appendix at the end as a response to Goldziher or Schacht or people in their opinion.	2001-05-16

After all if you know Arabic you need only one Qur'an not ten except for convenience. The web site for the publisher provides a good information what this translation is about and in what format it is printed. I found the book short in interpretation, definite in translation claiming almost %100 interpretation without any regard to various readings. I wish there was at least references to for example how Zamanshkari, Tabari or Ibn Keshir reads some ayats forget about how other sects reads it. Well it is nice package put together but it seems like I could do it without it especially after reading some conterversial ayats that sets the tone for the interpreter. I suppose as a punishmet not knowing Arabic as a mother tongue or close to it you need to read 10-20 different translations and make up your own mind. This is another occasion for me to praise the work done by Mr.Mahmoud Ayyoub, providing comperative translations in his book, &quot;Interpreters of Qur'an&quot;. I still think Mr.picktall's translation,although there is no interpretation, is still the best one or may be the words he uses are more open for different interpretations if you are translating the book ones more from English to your mother tongue.

In this book, although Schroedinger claims that he is not an expert in this field of Science he is certainly playing humble. He starts with the question, Why human beings have to be so big relative to Atoms, continues with Statistical concepts of Quantum Theory and than comes to the conclusion that the Genes really does not obey to statistical rules and therefore the life is stable and mutations are rare. In the second half of the book he goes into Philosophy and covers Mind and Matter. In the beginning he states that &quot;The world is a construct of our sensations, perceptions, memories&quot; I found this very interesting. Schroedinger provides very nice interpretation of entropy Concept and Statistical formulas.	2001-05-11

This is the story of Fermi mostly about his intellectual and social life and not about his private life and that part is in fact covered very nicely by his wife in her beautiful book. Segre without any short cuts describe Fermi, his behaior, his mastery in physics with all important documents reproduced and day by day their successes and few dissappointments. There are certain scientific explanations about the experiments they conducted days in and days out and if you are not into Atomic physics those explanations are just words but even if you do not know what they are doing you still get the pleasure of visualising masters in action. descriptions are very vivid. Hard work is necessary but knowing what you are doing is more important and this book along with the biographies of other master Physisist shows the same.

It basically interprets the first sura that is praise to God by individual and Pray to God in behalf of all. I did not particularly like the introduction section. There the author has a language that seem to imply that Islam and monotheism is perfected by Prophet Mohammed (pbh)rather than it being a direct revelation from God. In the  interpretation of the last ayat language seems to have been softened even though the author agrees about the validity of the hadit he mentiones in that part. I find it very interesting and correct the way author describes what different belief people think when they say God or Allah. I do not know what other Believers think but although it might be wrong I also have a different feeling when I utter the word &quot;God&quot; and &quot;Allah&quot; or &quot;Rabb&quot;. He might also be wrong too  for &quot;Allah&quot; or &quot;Rabb&quot; is defined in the Holy Qur'an but the word &quot;God&quot; is not defined and we just identify it as being equal to &quot;God&quot; which is defined in other beliefs and they have different concept of it such as Trinity Concept.	2001-03-24

A lot of difficult concepts from Classsical Statistical Physics, Probability Theory, Relativity and Mathematical Logic as well as a good understanding of Quantum Physics is assumed to be in the bag of the reader, after all this book is not a Popular Science book.  Although the author claims that knowledge of derivations of the formulas used are not critical to understand this study yet time to time the language and logic becames exteremely difficult. This is a must read book in this subject, may be many times or time and time over after increasing the understanding in other subjects that only tools in this book.	2001-03-24

For being about only Sunni Usul al-fikh the scope is limited to a certain sect. Author takes you through early years when he claims no methodology were existed than to Imam Shafii whom he does not put as a founding father in the field of fikh, continues with some quranic concepts like clear/ambigious ayats, foundations of hadits, abbrogation and than into tools of the law, concensus, ijma, qiyas, istihsan, istishab,ijtihad etc. The best part of the book is that author provides examples of each concept for illustration, explains opinions of known mujtehits on the subjects. The book closes with modernist efforts by F.Rahman and especially the author have high regards for Shahrur. The book shows although not in broad acceptance by everybody, the change in methodology from using Quran and Sunna of the Prophet(pbh) to Quran only and socio/politic conditions of the current times and elimination of Ijma or ancient ijtihads.	2001-03-18

The study explores the issues and various questions about the claimed variant dialects and than variant readings (differing meanings) and existence of various versions of the Quran and proves that all are isolated claims. The book is written from Sunni perspective and views of the Shia are disregarded or claimed to be unfounded. It also have a chapters on the origins of the first Mushaf and questions about abrogation where he agrees with abrogation of Quran with Sunnah in disagreement with Shia's point of view. It is not very conclusive and perhaps could not be but it lists all the famous interpretations and you make up your mind. It is a nice collection of information about the subject. Book is finalized with the qiraat and variations in qiraat.	2001-03-18

It is not a narrative book about Quantum Physics, it has Mathematical formulas and problems as well as some practical applications yet you do not need to know more than a good calculus to understand what is goung on. It starts with Schrodinger's equation and shows few applications and solutions and than Quantum Physical practical applications such as lasers etc. Although it is relatively easy to follow the book, a lot of logical steps and physical foundations of Quantum Physics are introduces as set of postulates without any hint of reasons for it. Unless you know those things from other sources it is not easy to catch those that authors have between the lines. I recommend it as an easy work book but not necessairly the one that takes you from Classical Physics and leads into Quantum Physics. The book fails to show the short comings of the Classical Physics and efforts of Quantum Physics to respond to problems. Suddenly we have the Schrodinger's equations and solves all your problems just like that.	2001-03-17

Book basically covers one by one each major works of Charles Bulfinch in Boston, New england and other parts of the country. It is combination of History and Architecture. Each building is described and most of the time a picture is provided. The scope is mostly Historical description of the buildings, locations and their style. It is not an Architectural analysis of his works showing details of each component but paralels are given from similar structures in England.If you happen to visit Boston and see buildings designed by Bulfinch you start to see things behind the facade and notice any changes that he did to originial buildings or others did to his buildings.	2001-03-15

This book is the abridged version of the original from same publisher at three times of the cost of this book. What you are missing is the theoretical part of his physics. Book basically covers his personal life with touch and go to Physical concepts. You do not get the ideas, how he developed the wave mechanics and other new concepts. What is striking is his life story, his running after fourteen years old teenagers, sleeping with his best friends wife or his wife sleeping with his best friends son, what a life, I could not believe. This was a schoking book for me, I, with my naivete perhaps did not expect such a behavior from a nobel lauriete and all the famous physisict of his time who knew about it and accepted him as he was. If he lived now he would have been in jail for child malestation. book is basically about his personal life from one love story to another which by the way at the conclusion of each love story he discovers something. if you want to read more about his life together with his physics, this is not the book, you need to read the original.	2001-03-08

Quran is viewed as a piece of poetry. Author in many occasions tries to tie the Qur'an with ancient Arabic poetry and tries to find paralells. I could not find any phrase that tells to the reader that this book is send down to humanity by God through Prophet Mohammed. I did not expect him to believe that but the whole approach is from a literary point of view. The minimal amount of commentaries are mostly his own as a pure interpreatation as a literary text. Poetic nature is emphasised and paralells are drawn between ancient Arabic themas and the Quranic subjects. There is nothing to learn from this book. If you want to read better things against Qur'an or Islam read Ibn Warraq, if you want to read real interpretation there are much much better books, read Gatje, Peters. This book introduces the Holy Qur'an as a piece of literature and poetry not as a divine book.	2001-02-14

If you are naive like myself you might be facing trecherous vacation as I call it. This book vividly explains what you will expect in the mountain Huts. You may end up sleeping with cows or going out in cold for a bathroom shed in the dark. I am happy that I read this book and rather hiking high I decided to walk downstairs. Authors have certainly very good experiences with the mountains, they know the people there and book explains life in the Huts and type of terrain you might expect and weather conditions. It is not certainly the hills of Vermont, it sounds like it is serious bussiness like climbing Mt. Everest or may be I got scared out of proportion, either way it is a must read for every novice wanderer before you get on the plain.	2001-02-11

Author refers to ayats from Qur'an and explains how Prophet Jesus is mentioned in the Qur'an versus the current Christian belief which is mostly in contradiction with Islam. It is double line printed short book and Author made it easy to read with clear logic. Naturally assumption is made that the Qur'an is correct and no importance is given to hadits relating to the issue and therefore the conclusions are clear and without any doubt. Book is definetely worth to read.	2001-02-11

There is another version of this book which is published in ten volumes. If you got the time to read that version has more explanations of course due to sheer volume of the book but still you see more comments from Bukhari than Tabari or Kurtubi. You could say that Tabari, Kurtubi, Ibn Keshir also used the Hadits from Bukhari but it would have been nice if referenced were made from which commentator the explanations were taken. Overall the book is good and easy to read explanations are straight in the line without going into notes at the bottom of the pages.

First He defines the words Decree and Destiny, than he continue with the ayats from Qur'an referencing the decree and destiny, provides his commentary on those ayats, sometimes referring back to sia sources, than in another chapter he provides sayings of the Muhammad (pbh) and Imams and than concludes with various subjects. In general the way I understands he explains decree as the laws of nature and destiny as the final result. He states that laws of creation is fixed what is not fixed is the actions of the individual. He also refers to a paragpah from Rumi that somewhat states that laws of nature is also part of the destiny and therefore decree and destiny is the same. I could not find any answer in response to the problem of evil or those whom god leads into err.He has an interesting definition for freedom of choice which he states that it is equal to lack of knowledge for, he says,not in exact words, if you knew what is right for you, you would have chosen the right one, truth is not a multiple choice. This book is a commentary to those ayats relating to decree and destiny. He defines his view as the one in the middle of Jabarriya and Kaderiya.Man has limited freedom. If I read it correctly in one example he seem to say that what god knows is the result of man's action but not what action man will choose at that moment. Man is responsible for their actions. I recommend this book to read, all related ayats are combined and interpreted in one book. He also says that God asked Adam (pbh) not to eat but God wished that he ate so that mankind would know the difference of good and bad.	2001-02-10

After a good and simple introduction you start to learn the difficulties and questions that resulted in String Theory, or Theory of everything or Grand Unification, whatever you call it. As you read the book if you are not the techinician of the field you start to imagine things and start to give shape to the things that are described. That is okey at least you became familiar with what is going on. He talks about Higgs fields, is it a type of a Corn field or may be a liitel more seriously, is it some kind of magnetic field.

Of course it sounds simple, after all there is a whole theory behind it and this book is written in paperback without any single formula. It is a good book for popular scientist, with this book you learn a littel more about the cosmological theories which Inflation is one of them. Due to the difficulty of the subject the teacher had to go into concepts that sound simple judging from the name but extremely diffcult to comprehend.If you know about the subject and most importanatly the tools of the trade, you understand better each sentence otherwise you just get the flare of it.  The book is the only as far as I know in this field written at this level as a story and especially by one of the founders of the theory, reminds me the book Hawkigns Universe, simplified very difficult concepts.	2001-02-10

Introductory Physics Series)	Books	3	12	13	N	N	An easy introduction to Quantum physics	This is a typical college text book written in intoductory level. Its approac is classical and explains the concepts relatively slow with examples. The mathematical language used is not modern in a sense that does not use operator language with high symbolizm but rather more classical approach. For students that are used to apply more classical Diff.equations or Real anaylsis, it is much easier even though they implicitly do the same with or without operators. If I were to chose only one book to read, I would have to select the book written by Resnick but obviously the more you read the more view points you will have and of course you will have less time to develop your own. In my opinion this is better than Feynmann Vol.3.	2001-02-10

This book is a life saver for those who wants to do comperative study on the commentaries on the Quran written by past and late Islamic Scholars. There seem to be only the first two volumes published and I hope Dr. Ayoub will continue his efforts. Book takes each ayat of the Qur'an and basically tells you the different interpretations of the same ayat from Ibn Kathir, Qurtubi, Al-Razi, nisaburi. Ibn Arabi, Tabari,Tabarsi, Zamakhsari and many others and goes to end to cap it with more &quot;contemporary&quot; Qutb and Tabatabai. Not all ayats are investigated, I assume Dr. Ayoub did not see much difference in those ayats but enogh is covered. The selection of the interpreters differs from ayat to ayat comparisons. in situations where Sunni and Shia interpretations are differed they are explored, I wish though Dr. Ayoub make the finishin conclusion aleays with one of the contemporary interpreters. Without this book, if you need to compare the various opinions and hopefully make your own opinion you would need to read average ten thousand pages from each interpreter. What a life saver this book is. Now you can take this book as a guide and explore deep into originals as needed. This is not a substitute for the voluminuous commentaries but rater very helpful quick finder where you can see the differences of opinions in a nutshell. This book also as a by product is a source book for the difference in Shia Islam and Sunni Islam.	2001-02-03

It is very contemporary interpretation mostly based on twelver's shia hadits and Quran itself. It does not try to marry the science and religion with some strange interpretations as may be subject to change and failure or try to interpret todays social and political conditions with Quran. It is not like Al-Razi's which keeps going into linguistics and Philosopical discussions of Medieval times, or as of Ibn Kathir's based on a lot of numerous hadits from various sources, or as that of Qutb's socio-political interpretation. Tabatabai makes his tafsir sometimes with comparisons from other sect's interpratation and try to prove the validity of his views. In same book you are exposed to both views but of course only one side is defended and it is up to you to defend the other side, which is a challenge of knowledge.As I said only first 8 volumes has been translated, so you do not get the entire Tafsir but almost half of the critical concepts have been covered.You can also feel the defence of Shia concepts against Sunni concepts. As part of the belief all hadits originating from Imams are consiered as absolute truth and therefore if there is any confilicting Hadit than it is overridden.The concept of Abrogation, Muta, opening ayats that are usually is a debated issue between various sects are strongly defended.	2001-01-28

The Book explains the development and expansion of the city in time and according to location. It is very vivid and especially if you have been a pedestrian offen on the streets of Boston, It starts to make sense and starts to give joy. As I read the book I started to appreciate more and more the efforts of BRA and Back Bay Society.unfortunately before they acted quite a number of beautiful structures has gone.Book has very extensive history from 1700 to 1970's and than it is summary or may be it is a living history for you. There are numerous pictures but the number of pictures is not as much as those you may find in other types of books, like Boston in Pictures, etc. After all it is a narrative book but there is sufficient amount of pictures to help you visulize. I wish a more comprehensive book were to be produces to show in same pages all the developments, similar to &quot;Boston, Than and Now&quot; but with more older pictures and more story as this book has.

The formulations are kept at absolute minimum almost non existent except very fundementals formulas are listed. Book is not for someone who wants to have working knowledge in the field but rather brief compact conceptual introduction to the field. It explains how it all started and  was developed. If you are interested in the field and if you already know some what you can read it in one day but the book is very compact. I am puzzeled with the author's statemant, if I took it correctly he states that Planck assumed quanta of energy before his discovery, I thought he used unit of energy to replace integration with summation, like Mathematical trick to eliminate the catashrophy and than realized what it meant for the Physics.Anyway, but be prepared time to time to jump into heavy Mathematics or Physics even though they are not written in conventional formulas but all in words. Author after all his experience certainly knows where people have difficulties and explains those concepts very nicely.	2001-01-27

As the Physical determinism is gone how do we content with Quantum indeterminism and relate it with old fashioned Religion. Author talks about a lot of things in the first half of the book and I had difficulty in relating one to other and all to Quantum Physics. The only concept that I could pick in the pages regarding the Quantum Theory was &quot;influence at distance&quot;, therefore all universe is interrelated and God is part of it. I am not even sure if I took it correctly. Certainly to me author did not have much conviction in Christianity or Islam as common peaople knows it. There are a lot of references and a lot of new subjects. It does not speak of Quantum Physics, it does not speak of Religion or Theology as I know it, he seem to define a &quot;Quantum Theologian&quot; as he goes along who looks at the nature as the whole, God and Nature. At the end of the book, in Appendix, finally author defines the &quot;Quantum Theology&quot; with 12 rules that are also expanded with some basic conclusions. It was difficult to read these conclusions in the text itself. May be the book is highly Philosophical and difficult for all to read. Rule #1 clearly defines God as energy and part of nature,Rule #10 says there is no beginning and no end to this world. This book was not for me, I think it is a misnamed book.	2001-01-27

Authors certainly knows quite a lot about Turkey. What they say is written in papers or spoken on the street but of course it does not mean that they represent the truth. It appears that they wanted to give a balanced description of the issues current in Turkey but they seem have overemphasized some ideas or thoughts that the exterimist are entertaining. Sometimes thay pick a statemant from person on the street and state it as a fact or the opinion of the people which reminds me the NBC Late Night show Jay Leno asking questions selected individuals on the street and getting stupid responses. What does it mean can you extrapolate from that. This book is about the political fights in Turkey and has nothing to do with the Turks or people living in that country. One dificulty for me was the chronological order. Authors most of the time used two step forward one step backward method in the chronology of the episodes. They talk about 1990 and than suddenly go back to 1984, difficult to follow, especially when the things are changing so fast and names are foreign. I liked the way they use Turkish icolloqial terms and proverbs. They certainly know a lot about Turkey but it seems to me they look at the things through a colored filter, they see what they want to see and emphasize what they think is important for them or for the book market or for the polls. They seem to think that Turkey and people in those areas just waking up to civilized world and understanding the issues such as human rights and all other hot issues but like God says in Qur'an one must pray for &quot;God pleae do not test me like those you have tested before me&quot;. In response to one of the rewievers, I believe from Shanghai, the proverbs or proses in the beginning of the chapters makes sense if you are very familiar with Turkey. They are like one liners. I do not see any benefit in reading this book if you are going to travel to Turkey or stay there for a while. It is good only if your intentions are to be a politician in Turkey and it prepares you before you embark into that journey. But in political life I suppose like Jos.Kennedy has said &quot;It is not important who you are but rather what people think how you are&quot;. If that is the case the observations of the authors of the political persons has nothing to do with the real people and this book is only observations.	2001-01-20

He used the name Muhammadan rather than Islam or Muslim but it is how it is. After brief descriptiion of Islam a chapter explains quite extensively the history and nature of the Muslim Pilgrimage to Mecca. It tries to relate the rituals with old arabic customs, ayats from the Qur'an and additional rituals that for political reasons,he claims, Prophet Muhammed tried to give unique look to it. Draws paralells between old Judaism and Idolatry in Arab penisula. Book next covers the fasting and than Shi'a concept of the tenth of Muharram activities and Sufism. Non of the above in my mind can be considered as &quot;Festival&quot; in the sense of entertainment, so the name of the book might be misleading but yes in all occasions at the end of the rituals people celebrate it and conratulate each other except 10th of Muharram and a joyfullness fill the air but these are not part of the rituals.It is easy to read and understand, it covers all major concepts and steps in the rituals, few pictures are included but of course they date back. In short a good amount of fundemental information is provided in a small book, it is very efficient.	2001-01-14

It also in the background shows the political fight between the ruling nations in the region, Ottomans, Persians and later the British. Most interestingly, you can see  the political power games Muctehids played throughout the years to secure their positions and how they have changed sides depending on circumstances. As a religious person I had to take some of the statements about the intentions of the Muchtehids with reservation for further study. There were some statements such as Turkey during their own independence war was trying to occupy Iraq which is news to me but I you learn something everyday. It is very detailed. For someone who is not very familiar with the Iraq's political landscape may get lost in the sea of names and numbers but that also make the book verifible. It basically gives the impression that Shi'is of Iraq do not have a strong identity and has been used by political figures in one way or other also reminds me the Azerbaijanis in Persia, different race same sect, where do you stand.	2001-01-10

It makes your mind twist when you start to know about things that you see everday or you walk by it. I never knew what the word &quot;smoot&quot; on Harvard Bridge was about although I step on it every day. From the old Sahwmut Bank logo I always thought that Shawmut was an Indian tribe. I thought blackstone river or vally was called blackstone may be because the stones were black and many other similiar associations. What about Quaker Lane in downtown. Well I am not going to tell you what is in the book, you need to read it but it is full of suprizes, at least for me it was. Now like they say when you meet someone after you had a telephone conversation, &quot;I can put a face to it&quot;. Since I read the book it is &quot;Frogg Lane&quot; for me not Bolyston Street.

In one book the entire development of the mass concept is descibed in a narrative form except towards the end when the relativistic mass concept is explained. It starts with ancient thouts and end with Quantum Mechanical concept of the mass, relating each new concept with the previous as it isa developed. Although it is mostly narrative, in order to understand and enjoy the book and history of &quot;Mass&quot; some physics/mathematics background is necessary. I really enjoy this series.	2001-01-06

It is about discussions on faith and reason, existence of God from different approaches, miracles and its compatibility with science, ethics and religion. In short all religious concepts and beliefs in relation to reason is discussed and different view points are explained. For each case the streght and weakness of the arguments are highlighted. Language used is not deep philosopical and therefore it is easy to read and understand.  There is no conculusive arguments but rather the issues are identified and different responses is studied as general knowledge. It is a good text book for starters. Each chapter ends with list of questions for study with extensive suggested readings list.	2001-01-06

In three volumes you get the origins of the three religions with comparisons and particular beliefs. very valuable comments on scriptures. Book has considerable amount of references and original quotations. I really enjoy the way Mr. Peters writes. I found his book on Life of Mohammed also very nice and informative. These three volumes are also same quality.	2000-12-30

As you read the pages you grow together with Heisenberg in his daily life and his achievements in Physics. You start to understand how the Quantum Mechanics was founded, how trial and error methods eventually developed into such a fundemental theory. The book is very voluminious but if you have patient in reading it on each line you live the life of a great man. I found it very interesting that even though he is one of the great founders of the Quantum Physics, he had more vacations than me and enjojed the life better than me. It shows that to be a good scientist you just have to carry your brain and think while wandering in the country side. Isn't it great. Apparently he did not even know Matrix Theory until Bohr showed him. Every page is full with history, science and suprise. Story is so vivid that you can even visualise the streets of Munich or other German towns as you read the book. Grat book,a lot of pages in fine print but worth of it.	2000-12-30

It has logic built in to it.Main topic is response to Orientalist in their effort to minimize Islam and reduce it to just a Arab custom. Nasr responds to all their claims(may be not all there are so many)and seems to me that he bases all his responses on the idea that Orientalist do not belive Islam being a God given religion. He shows that when they attack Islam they use the arguments that say not having a good logical foundation but in turn they use same arguments in their own religion as fundemantel concepts. As Nasr puts it,He is ready to accept these claims from idolaters but not from the people of the book, for we all have the same fundemantel beliefs about how religions are revealed. All religions are based on some sort of belief and I believe even the quran states that this book is for believers who believe in unseen. What makes Islam better than others is for me that it has more reason and concept built into it.	2000-12-16

Most books I have seen basically are dry Mathematical Formulas which requires a lot to reading into formulas to get the real physical meaning behind those formulas.  This book is perfect it tells you why certain things can not be explained by Classical Physics (Instead of simply stating that) and what assumptions are being made and where the problem was and therefore the Quantum Physics is there.  It has numerous examples for you to see real applications and scales of the things. Everytime I opened the book I was so happy that I finally came across such a good book. I have no problem with the amount of verbatim in the book as some of the commentators had. I believe it is that feature of the book that makes it clear Physics book. Every line has a significance in the fundamentals of the subject.	2000-12-16

Tremendeous effort has gone into this book, compiling various writers on the subject. What I find interesting is that he starts the arguments claiming that Hadits are created after the fact for the occasions and therefore has no value in their truth and turns around uses the same hadits to discredit Mohammed or Islam.What kind of logic is this is beyond me. Also some people are attacking the Hadit Books of Islam but they forget that those Hadits are written based on the criteria of &quot;chain of transmission&quot; and not necessariliy on the criteria of being consistent with Islam. As I said it is an informative book to see the view of the other side and think about it and try to find the fallacies, like a examination that makes you more knowledgable in your religion by properly responding to each argument. If you are so called &quot;Modern minded&quot; and take his words on their face value, than you will loose your faith in Islam and apply it to any other religion you will loose it no matter what it is.	2000-12-16

It was interesting to read this book to see the  paralells betwwen the religions. I do not see the pount in comparing the  ideas and stories in three major religions and claiming that Islam is a  copy from the other religions and therefore has no value. etc. After all  islam does not reject those religions but does not accept as they are  either. If you do not believe in Mohammed why should you believe in others.  after all at least we know Mohammed lived yet there is no Scientific proof  that Jesus or Moses lived. I read it with joy because short of reading the  other Bibles this book gave me compariosn in short time, made me familiar  with other religions easliy. If the objective was to prove that it is a  lie, it failed, how can you prove a thing as a lie if your means is also  potentially a lie.If you are looking for reasons not to believe in prophets  at all than read it, they all appears to be story but if you want to see  the claims of the other side, than it is interesting but there are better  things to read.	1998-12-27
