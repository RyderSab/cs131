But that is their self-serving way of avoiding responsibility.  If liberals appear to them to be &quot;fuming and seething with rage&quot; it is because books full of lies are published and passed off as truth.  Conservative's idea of truth is not based on objective, verifiable facts, but rather what fits their America-hating worldview and their attitude of &quot;I've got mine so screw you&quot;.  Conservatives cannot accept the reality that W. Bush was far more negligent and damaging to America than Clinton.  It is time for conservatives to stop destroying America.<br />Miniter's credibility has been called into question.  It is even more telling that he comes out of the woodwork when one of the sources backing his statements calls them into question.  It needs to be asked if Miniter is lying about Clarke.  If you don't ask this question, then you are not being informed, you are just looking for things to read which confirm your worldview.  That is ok, it is your money.

Or, Sandy Berger, a former and probably future Clinton employee with a vested interest in keeping his and his bosses mistakes under the carpet? I'll go with the colonel.&quot;<br />You believe what you need to believe, but you don't have the intellectual honesty to recognize this as a serious and credible dispute of the colonel, made by a person with an impeccable record for honesty and integrity in addition to being (then) the official with the most senior responsibility for National Security.  That would be Berger.  Sandy Berger is an honest man and American hero who has earned the respect and deserves to be taken seriously by all patriotic Americans.<br />The colonel?  Colonels have no motivation to lie?  Note that there is a lot of $$$ to be made from the hate Clinton/America crowd who in their need to satisfy their hateful lust believes in such things.  The clue to this is to note how much he follows the pre-established script and speech patterns that have been conveniently laid out by the other hate Clinton/America books.<br />You want further proof?  How many conservatives have criticized Mr. Bush for sitting for a half hour in the grade school after knowing the nation was under attack?  He might have been able to order the last two (or three) planes to be shot down (whose status as being hijacked surely was known) and at least save the people in one tower and the Pentagon.  Only the president could have ordered that, and he couldn't have done that while sitting in the classroom and reading stories, no matter how noble that is.<br />Again.

It would be one thing if Miniter presented facts and analysis, but this book has neither.  When you read this book, you get the impression that Miniter simply doesn't like America or her values, and you come away asking &quot;Why?&quot;<br />When President Clinton closed of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House after terrorism in Oklahoma City, some Republicans accused him of hysteria.  Most decent Americans are appreciative of all the efforts President Clinton did to stop terrorism.   He did all he could and had his share of his successes.  The federal budget on anti-terrorism tripled during the wonderful years that Clinton was in office, to about $6.7 billion.  Timothy McVeigh is no longer with us.  When Clinton ordered military action to kill Osama bin Laden, the Republicans accused him of &quot;wagging the dog&quot;.  The perpetrators of the 1st WTC bombing have been captured.  Four followers of the Egyptian cleric Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman were captured and sentenced to 240 years in prison each. The purported mastermind of the plot, Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, was captured in 1995, convicted of the bombing in November 1997, and also sentenced to 240 years in prison. One additional suspect fled is believed to be living in Baghdad. Has that person been found?  The LAX and Seattle terrorists have been captured.  The serious lapses started with the current occupant of the White House.  As 2003 comes to a close, we have not captured Bin Laden, despite the international support that was mobilized after the tragic events of 911.   Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger told the incoming administration that Bin Laden will be their biggest concern.  Why did not Mr. Bush take Mr. Berger seriously?<br />The Republicans misunderstood how serious President Clinton was. Instead of criticizing President Clinton, this book should be criticizing the conservatives for underestimating and undermining President Clinton's heroic fight against terrorism. <br />Could it be that Miniter is putting partisanship above patriotism?<br />Remember: The right wing lies.

He was one who did his homework, and the military minds were always impressed at his preparation and brilliance.  <br />The results speak for themselves.  President Clinton prosecuted a war (Kosovo) with far greater competence than has the current POTUS.  For one thing, he engendered far more international support.  Where is Milosevic?  Being tried as a war criminal.  Where is Saddam?  Where is Bin Laden?   Nobody knows.<br />When President Clinton was commander in chief, the seriousness he took in combating terrorism led to terrorist operations directed against the Los Angeles International Airport and the Seattle space needle being stopped.  <br />The first thing that the intelligence community noticed when the current POTUS took power was his dereliction in fighting terrorism.   He stopped valuable drone flights that were gathering intelligence information over Afghanistan.<br />Remember:  Olivier North was also a Lieutenant Colonel, and he has been proven to lie.

William Bennett thinks he has an inside straight to the Truth, but in reality he subscribes to the fallacy that &quot;cultural and moral relativism&quot; has no concept of right and wrong.<br />A \\"moral relativist\\" can condemn the terrorist attacks of 911.  For those of you who are scoring at home, the actions of 911 were perpetrated by people with absolutist views and felt with certainty their actions were made with moral clarity.<br />Rejecting absolute values does not mean abdicating personal responsibility, ethical behavior, or patriotism.  It does not mean that the beliefs you hold are immoral.  Above all, it does not mean that you act without an idea of right and wrong.  Oh contraire, it means you have to act carefully and try harder, because you know that you do not have the final answer and that you acknowledge that there is no mechanism in which you can verify them independently and absolutely.<br />My point is that this is a far wider spread of morality in the pragmatism of rejecting values in terms of absolutes than in the absolutism of the Bennetts and the George W Bushes of the world.  When you are absolutely certain that your views correspond to God's will, trouble happens.  Absolute power corrupts absolutely.<br />We all know what is going on here.  Mr. Bennett is attempting to make a case of moral equivalence between the 911 attackers and his political enemies, the \\"diversity mongers [and] multiculturalists\\" and anybody else who does not think or look like himself.  When Bennett urges &quot;the reinstatement of a thorough and honest study of our history,&quot;  we know \\"honest\\" is a code word for reading history the way he and his billionaire right-wing sugar daddies want us to.  So in reality, this is just one more hand dealt in their grab for power.

Still I think the authors are overly self-conscious, and that gets in the way.  They make no bones about being political, even sometimes feel guilty about it.  Plus in an effort to avoid Eurocentricism, they have Europhobic blind spots.  Too much they are concerned about categorizing about 'uptown' vs. 'downtown' and being partisian about it.<br />Still, it is a great book to read because of the issues it raises and makes you think about.<br />And it is great to read about a Papuan New Guineau tribe's encounter with the performance of Nefertiti by the Miles Davis Quintet	2003-01-31

The latest essay is from 1982, and they all are hopelessly dated.  Roger Reynolds \\"Mind Models\\" from the 70s generates more excitement and shows more relevance to today's scene than Rochberg's stuffy, self-referential musings.  This book is destined to collect dust at university libraries, only to be read by those who want to read something that confirms their views, as evidenced by William Bolcom's introduction.<br />If you must read, ask yourself this question:  On what basis should we take Rochberg seriously?  Where is an epistemology that we can trust?	2003-01-11
