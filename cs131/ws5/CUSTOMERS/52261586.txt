First of all - don't mistake this book with &quot;Between the strokes of night&quot; which deals with life-prolongation by altering the body's metabolic speed and time sense. Now, the reason everybody are so dissapointed, I believe, is that the book lacks Sheffield's usual giant scope, and therefore highly advenced thechnolegy, with the setting in the far future. (allthough thet description is'nt compatiblle with the wonderfull &quot;Proteus&quot; series). But the plot did waver a bit. the climax was not all that. I do think though that all the charecters were excellent, and developed through the book. Not a bad story, it's only the higher expectations of the readers from sheffield.	2001-08-28

I've been more dumb-founded by the sheer influence of Drake Merlin on the universe ,Than touched with the understanding of Gaia's motives.<br />Maybe it's only me ,though I'm not a &quot;only hard&quot; sci-fi man ,but I believe &quot;T&amp;T&quot; and &quot;Genesis&quot; investigate the same sector of the future ,and although &quot;Genesis&quot; is an excellent book - &quot;T&amp;T&quot; is better.

Humanity's not allowed to enter any Link - the way to the stars, because of it's ability to think of and perform violence - even against sentient beings, a thing that is unthinkable to the STELLAR GROUP.<br />A lone link is opened for our race, apparentlly it is'nt controled by the aliens, but nothing thet goes through does'nt come back or sends any signals back. The stellar group calls upon the famed Chan Dalton to explore the link, in exchange for the lifting of the quarantine on humanity.<br />Besides his assembled crew he chances upon a single representative of each of the alien races, and that prohibits the possibility of dealing with whatever they find with any form of violence - even in self defence!<br />The book reads fast and is as flowing as any Sheffield product, but I must say thet the spirit of &quot;The Mind Pool&quot;, with it's striking contrasts between human, tinker-composite, pipe-rilla and sellora's angel, was not reproduced in the same vivid action or dialogues.

The Deeans are waiting for they're ship to come and conquer Earth.<br />Another issue is the Man-Woman thing. I'm affraid that a feminst would not like this book. Van Vogt try's to explain women behavior in a set of actions and reactions ,which are not only simple ,but are not very convincing. This is really ,i think this book's down side. I don't believe ,notice ,that he's a real chaouvinist ,but Van-Vogt is known in his wonderfull behavioral theories in his books ,that even when they are obvieously wrong ,they are beuatifully structured. This time it simply did'nt come off right.<br />The book is not as idea filled as others of the same manufacteror ,but all in all ,not really bad too.

The first depicting the Homo-gestalt's forming ,the second ,the replacment of it's &quot;head&quot; ,the individual who makes everyone be one ,and the third- how and why that man becomes moral though no human rules aply to him. He is superior ,not only in his own mind but truly in every aspect. why should he obey our rules? if you were all alone would you conform to the social rules and mores of mice?<br />But there is something ,and the few last paragraphs turn the whole story into really wide-scale ,optimistic and exciting science fiction.<br />Very modern concepts there ,by the way ,on mental powers ,such as I would not expect from a 1953 book. recommended.	2001-01-24

To be even more precise, he is one of the best HARD sci-fi  writers.<br />The reason people read &quot;Destiny's Road&quot; and felt  something missing, or that the book is not quite on the level with other  works of Larry, is that it's a try at SOFT sci-fi, and since most people  are not even aware that there is a &quot;soft&quot; as well as  &quot;hard&quot; science fiction (although they know the difference  intuitively), they don't get what they expected and are disappointed.<br />The  difference lies in the emphasis on high-tech and aliens in HARD sci-fi, and  the development of the human society or pcychological expiriences (with  futuristic backround) in SOFT sci-fi. And that's ofcourse generaly  speaking.<br />Anyway, the book's plot is about a young man named Jemmy  Bloocher, who lives on Destiny, in the 28th century, gets in trouble, and  must leave his beloved &quot;Spirel Town&quot; and seek his furtune at the  ROAD (that exists since the &quot;Cavorite&quot; which is a shuttle,  hovered a meter above the land and glided into the unknown), he finds  different towns, with many kinds of social-orders, until he reaches the end  of the road, and discovers a few things about how his world is run.<br />I  must say that except the protagonist, there is a carechterization problem  with the multiple carechters (it's like, you can't get to know them, before  Jemmy moves on). Also, the book read's like a collection of short stories  with the same protagonist, instead of as one work.<br />To say the truth, I  prefer Niven's HARD works. This book deserves 3.5 stars, but since we ARE  talking about Larry Niven, I rounded it up to 4, instead down to 3.<br />After  all considerations, it's an o.k one.	2000-09-07

I'm writing from a point-of-view that belongs to the 21yr, sci-fi freak, martial artist, I.D.F soldier, israeli citizen, and man that I am.<br />The  series of books this book begins, is something that should unite all  mankind in it's pleasures, it's wonder, it's fascinating mind (from 1912!),  in great things sci-fi make you think of, in it's mind-developing in kids,  and other pluses.<br />Mean while, those great pleasures are saved,  reluctently, to us alone, science-fiction readers. You should be happy that  YOU have an open mind- to enjoy &quot;Princess from Mars&quot;. Wonderfull  world, exciting life-forms, cruel fighters, beautifull princesess, non-stop  action, with this BASIC masterpiece from the dawn of sci-fi.<br />An avid  reader can spot the &quot;Barsoom&quot; and &quot;Jhon Carter&quot; in many  of the later coming top-authors. Zelazney AND Larry Niven are amongst those  who paid tribute to Edgar rice Burroughs in their works (Niven I believe,  was very influenced by Tars Tarakas, while writing &quot;Ringworld&quot;,  and conjuring Speaker-to-animals.)<br />Anyway, I found those books in my  continuing study of old sci-fi, and they are ofcourse among my most  treasured ones, with 12 (for now) books of A.e Van Vogt, and the Lensmen  series of E.E Smith.<br />And don't think im one of those old-guys who read  nothing written after the 50' too. I've read Niven, Zelazney, Heinlin,  Asimov, silverberg, Sheffield, Vinge, Bester,'K.Dick, williamson, Holdman,  Herbert, Hoze Farmer, and many more. Those books i'm talkin' about are  written with a different style maybe, but they are just as good as modern  sci-fi knockout's like &quot;Dune&quot; or &quot;Ringworld&quot; or I don't  know, the're excellent!<br />For those &quot;Hard sci-fi only&quot; guys(with  you at spirit) these books tend to be somewhat fantastical. But that's  because they were written before sci-fi and fantasy broke away in their own  directions and became different janres. Just don't sayI didn't warn 'ya.  Highly recommended.	2000-09-02

This review covers the whole &quot;Lensmen&quot; series not only  &quot;Triplanetary&quot;.<br />What I ment in the headline, was that when you  read old science fiction, dated or just old, you should not judge it by  modern sci-fi standarts. Either you use the standarts that were acceptable  at the time, or your criterion should be reading pleasure (while  disregarding with a smile a few flaws).<br />If you're judging any kind of old  writing with today's standarts then you are being unfare towards yourself,  besides ofcourse the book, 'cause you'll not be able to enjoy excellent  features of a work, other than scientific credebility, or being politicaly  correct.<br />the &quot;Lensmen&quot; series is a great space-opera built like  an onion- every time an enemy is defeated, there is another one behind him,  more secrative and stronger. The lensmen, on the other hand must strech  their powers and abilities, while discovering new ones here and there, to  super-human levels of stress, untill the last battle with the true source  of evil in the universe.<br />True, it's dated, not politicaly correct, it's  scientific credebility is so-so, and not very complex plot-wise.<br />On the  other hand it's full of exploding action, killer telepathic monsters,  ultra-powerfull weapons, super-fast space ships, perfect heroes who look  good, think fast, poses steel-nerves, allways know what to do, and are  unshakeble in their belief in goodnes. Oh, they allso get the most  beautifull girls in the world(s). It is, after all considerations, A GREAT  TALE.<br />Look, this saga has it's flaws. Still, it's a masterpiece and one  of the important building-blocks of science-fiction.<br />Recommended to old  sci-fi lovers, fans interested in the development of the field, and those  interested in scoially studying the 50'.	2000-09-01

Because he wanted  to rest a little from hard sci-fi or to get a different writing expirience,  and now everyone claim that the book is not as good as the other Niven  works, well he did'nt try to write another &quot;Ringworld&quot;, if you'll  just relax and have a fun reading you'll get the most out of &quot;Rainbow  Mars&quot;.<br />The book, by the way, is full of cute references to many old  sci-fi books such as Edgar Rice Burroughs's Barsoom, H.G.Wells's &quot;War  of that world&quot; etc'.<br />A nice reading from one of the masters of hard  sci-fi, writing leasurely a comic fantazy, that should be read without  preconceptions.	2000-08-30
US	52261586	R24BR3OPEV4GT9	0451159764	309303253	Jack of Shadows	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Excellent fantasy, more adventurous than philosophic.	BACKROUND: the world is'nt spining, On lightside- science rules, On  darkside- magic.<br />Jack of shadows is a darkside power- that means he's not  only soul'les, has many lives and he fights dirty, like all darksiders, but  he is a kind of a demon- his full powers are not clear. He's a sorcerer, a  warrior, and a very acomplished thief.<br />The plot is about ShadowJack's  revange on a few enemies, and his rise to power and domination of all  darkside.<br />This is one of Zelazney's best works, though I believe  &quot;Lord of light&quot; and &quot;Creatures of light and darkness&quot;  are better. It's as good as the original five AMBER books more or  less.<br />Anyway, ShadowJack himself is the best protagonist that ever came  from under the master's pen. He is clearly Corwin's proto-type, but better  than him nontheless. Cruel, strong, unforgiving, reptile-like, elusive. He  reminds me of moorcock's Elric of Melenibone.<br />The spirit of the story is  not as philosophic as some later books of Zelazney, though there are a few  conversations with MorningStar (wait 'till you know him, he's great) that  tends towards introspection as well as theology etc'. But even without  heavy meanings behind every sentence, it's sheer delight to read a Zelazney  book.<br />This is not a soft sci-fi book mind you, It's pure fantasy. VERY  RECOMMENDED.	2000-08-29

This book is a self defense , step by step , do-as-in-the picture  book.<br />It's quite good actually , in comparison to others of it's kind.  But the point is that a book like that would never have been published if  Bruce Lee was still alive. The set patterns of reactions against attack  shown in it , are a complete contradiction to the basic ideas and  open-mindness in JKD , That give the subject of fluidity in motion and  continuation of movement , heavy importance.<br />All in all , not bad , but I  would'nt recommend it to a serious martial artist , that want's to  understand those amazing insights that Bruce used to conjure without  preceeding thought. The rest of the series is absolutley excellent though ,  And you should buy the rest without the first one.	2000-08-26

So many enlightments , and such indepth look on  EVERYTHING that makes a martial-artist an efficiant fighter!<br />Bruce lee  was a kinethetic genius , a very intelligent person , a gifted  martial-artist , and an avangard-thinker - You will never think the same  about martial arts practicallity again , and the change is for the better ,  believe me.<br />A mixture of philosophy and down-to-earth tips , remarks  concerning being better than you are now , and more than that , makes this  one of the greatest martial-arts books ever written.<br />A MUST FOR THE  ANALLITIC/SCIENTIFIC MARTIAL-ARTIST.	2000-07-29

If you've read Van-Vogt before you know that a comment like that is not to be taken lightly.<br />Writen in 1970 and being rather &quot;new&quot; in Vogtian  standarts , I was afraid that Van has gotten old , lost his zest , and boy  , how wrong was I ! <br />From the first word I was captivated in the story of  Modyun - a far future human man that has a 30cm body and a 15inch diameter  head. Modyun , who's a telepath and a genius using 100% of his brain's  potential like all other humans ( who numbers a mere 1000 )decides to  enlarge his body to the original size of the ancient humans , and take a  tour around the world , to see how the animal-men are doing.<br />The  animal-men , ofcourse , were created by Man by mixing every animal's DNA  with human's inorder to give them intelligence. When that was achived , Man  has built the animal-men cities and food-commisary's and factories to  fulfill every need , and that done - reduced his number to a representative  1000 and began passing time in emotion-free , stimulant-free , totaly  peacfull philosophic existance.<br />When Modyun encounters the world outside  the human valley , he has many enlightment's on the way &quot;ancient  man&quot; use to think and feel , and the way the body , not the brain ,  was mostly responsible for those feelings because of the number and  intensity of the stimulations over-flowing into the mind and interfere with  rational thought. Besides fighting his own bodily sensations , Modyun is  noticing a diference in the way the world is run ! He begins his  investigations and does have some success but the thing that holds him back  is really his own attitude - after hundread's of years of peacfull  existance , Modyun is almost uncapable of identifying a violent situation ,  not to mention a suspicion of scheming !<br />I won't tell you what Modyun  finds out and how he deal's with it , but I'll tell you that though : this  bookis a wonderfull exemple of the mind-expanding works Van-Vogt give us  every once in a while. It might have been his greatest , if the end  would'nt have been a bit rushed - hence the four stars. But anyway , It's  an excellent book , and you should read it if you're an early sci-fi lover  , an A.E Van-Vogt fan , or a person interested in having a wonderfull  reading experience.<br />Very recommended.	2000-07-02

He is also the last Navajo indian in the world.<br />The world goverment calls upon his skils when an alien diplomat is threatened by a shape-shifting  assasin. Singer's got an awful suspicion - that one of his many catches -  the last of its kind ,  one-eyed , cat-like shape-shifter , is  intelligent.<br />He goes to the zoo , where Cat communicates with him  telepatically , and promises Cat his own life if only he'll agree to  protect the alien diplomat. Cat agree's and indeed kills the assasin.<br />But  then , he wants to change the deal. Cat want's a return match , another  hunt , but this time as the hunter. Singer agree's but his past does'nt  allow him to fight for his life without reservasions. He has an  unconscience death-wish.  He must come to terms with his roots - his indian  beliefes , mithology and power-songs. He must also overcome his wife's  death , and connect with the new era - learn to think as a modern man ,  inorder to survive this hunt where his skils are pitted against a  shape-shifting telepath that hates him like the devil!<br />I gave the book  only 4 stars 'cause i've read better from Zelazney , but you can feel the  familiar touch , although in this book , there's less use of mithology and  alot more writing about indian spirituality. As always a bit philosophical  but not to heavy on the mind.<br />A nice book I recommend , espacialy to fans  of Zelazney's work.	2000-06-29

The Puppeteers must  have more information. The builders might be dangerous.<br />The puppeteer ,  Louis and speaker travel to Ringworld , &quot;land&quot; upon it and go  through many adventures in order to mend their spaceship (yes it's hurt ,  eventhough it's a general-products hull).<br />This book is among the most  praised science fiction books in the world , like &quot;Dune&quot; or the  original &quot;Foundation&quot; trilogy , and rightfully so ; I promise you  one of the most memorable protagonists you have read about , and ofcourse ,  no side-kick is equel to speaker-to-animals. The plot is excellent , the  science is superb if you let the few points that make this a  science-FICTION work pass with a smile instead with a grunt. Besides , not  everyone will understand enough to recognize a scientific immposibility ,  and therefore , the science is also great.<br />Since we are talking about  Niven , you know the writing itself is excellent , filled with interesting  ideas , facsinating races and cool weapons , in such good use that I can't  put it to words - the book is just too great - read  it.<br />&quot;RingWorld&quot; is a masterpiece by one of the best hard-style  sci-fi writers , and is equeled by few indeed.<br />VERY RECOMMENDED.	2000-06-21

It is the story of fascinating human society , a mixture of royalty and nobels with a military aristocratism , in a the year 3000+ ,that spans hundreads of planets , and  it's first contact with an alien race.<br />Never before , and I have read  MANY books , have I ever read about an alien race so ancient , well-planned  , thought-of , original , remarkebly-diffrent-from-humans , and fascinating  as the Moties. They are , without doubt , the best aliens I have ever read  about.<br />Besides that , simply every charecter in the book was developed  into a completly realistic human-being you could understand it's perfectly  clear logic and expect it to act according to it's nature.<br />&quot;The Mote  In God's Eye&quot; also features the most indepth look into an alien  society , culture and way-of-thinking than I have ever encounterd  else-where. The Motie's way-of-thought is truely different than human's and  is wonderfully showed through the non-human charecters.<br />Don't worry ,  it's not all socieology ,there's Niven scientific writing and ideas  coupeled with Pournle's militarism and action. It is the fullest book I've  read - it leaves nothing out! action , drama , suspense , hard-technolegy ,  alien-secrets and schemes , human politics and power-struggels , love and  trust , violence and suspicision , and all writen with the best hands in  science-fiction , trancending everything writen before , and so-far ,  everything writen afterwards.  <br />One thing I've not mentioned thus far is  the phlilosofic side of the book and it's critecism on today's society ,  but for that you'll have to read it for your selves , not be told about  it.<br />I've probably left something unsaid , so just know that this book is  BETTER than what can be writen about it , and you must READ IT in order to  really undestand it's greatness.<br />Not just very recommended but A MUST  READ.	2000-06-21

'How can it be soft?' you may ask , with Gully Foyle's agression and even cruelty so obviuos (?)- Well , looking at the story sci-fictionally , it's  a story of a 24th century human civilization that discovered  mental-teleportation , told through it's protagonist's quest of unrelenting  revange.  It deal's mainely in the humans and the society , especially  through Gully's mental-state. the way he achived huge feats with his  twisted motivation.  <br />The book is an excellent action-adventure , Gully  is violent , dark-mooded , unstopble and cruel. He fights against a whole  society from the inside and in a way , wins.<br />What is so great about it is  the way Bester created this world where it's obvious you can teleport  (given you know where you are and where you're going) , you must file  official reports about your distance-jumping grade (according to mental  level) in order to get even a simple job!<br />Gully Foyle himself is one of ,  I guess , the most memmorable protagonists in all the field of science  fiction ever.

Time after time Larry Niven's powers of scientific speculation and extrapolation left me gaping.<br />This book is not cruicial to the understanding of &quot;Ringworld&quot; , as one of the reviwers claimed ,  but it will add a welcome information and explanations as to it's origins  and the true origin of humans.<br />The Pac race is brilliantly presented and  is fascinating. They are all geniuses and super-intellectuals - forced to  live by their insticts.<br />             THE PLOT :<br />Psssst-Poc is a  offspringless-pac - and that's trouble. he must find a purpose for living  or he'll just lose his appetite and die.<br />Going trough the grand archives  of his race library while allready starving , he finds a clue as to the  whereabouts of a lost Pac colony.<br />The lost cuase gives purpose to his  life.  He builds a spaceship (first time I understood how a ramscoop works  , and I was 11 when I read it for the first time!), and goes on a 32,000  years trip. Don't worry , due to the speed of his ship and relativity he'll  only age about 30,000 years.<br />Oh , yeah. I forgot to say that pacs can  live thousands of years. nobody knows how many , cause they die violent  deaths all the time , or lose their appetites. <br />Anyway , when Pssst-poc  arrives earth (didn'tcha get it already?) he's amazed the star-faring  civilization he sees and it's advenced technolegy.  and the pacs have  changed. they're mutants! <br />From this point on the story really soars into  a wonderfull exemple of scientific theory (in both fields of evolution and  phisics) , Niven-style action , and great universe-building (the  &quot;known-space&quot; is considered , in my opinion , the  best).<br />Niven's charecterizations are remarkeble , his writing is pure  reading pleasure , his ideas and conceptions are strikingly bright , and  the story - as fluent as water.<br />It is a book you will remember , being a  Niven fan or not.<br />To those who read every known-space book or short story  - I think that apart from &quot;Ringworld&quot; itself ,  &quot;Protector&quot; is the best known-space novel. Can you  disagree?<br />VERY RECOMMENDED.	2000-06-13

First a remark : I believe that the plot of &quot;Empire of the atom&quot; was the inspiration to the BBC's famous &quot;I , Claoudius&quot;.<br />&quot;Wizard of lin&quot; continues the story of lord  Clane , this wonderfull mutant with a twisted body and an ingenius mind.  Lord Clane must , this time , deal with both a fearsome military leader  from the saturn moons , and the second Riss invasion - the same Riss that  destroyed man's civilization 8000-12000 years ago.<br />In this book there is  maybe a bit less plot-twists than in the usual Van-Vogt BUT don't think I  mean that the book is below the Vogtian average - on the contrary - it is  among the best.<br />Political schems on personal-power-strugles on personal  conflicts and so on. On top of all that , as in &quot;Empire of the  atom&quot; , you get a glimpse into a world where advenced technolegy such  as spaceships is used to move armies into battles of face-to-face combats  with swords and axes in hand.<br />A uniqe future , the writing of a master ,  and a truly vivid hero , makes &quot;Wizard of lin&quot; and ofcourse  &quot;Empire of the atom&quot; , books that I REALLY didn't want to finish  reading.<br />My grade : EXCELLENT.	2000-06-10

Let me say first that I'm the youngest and most eager Alfred Elton Van-Vogt fan I know.<br />I'm 20 years old and so far I've read 11 &quot;Vogtians&quot; , and that's alot for someone in Israel - we don't  have his books around.<br />And ofcourse , everyone says that the  &quot;Beagle&quot; is , if not the best , then one of the 3 best Van-Vogt  novels.<br />I disagree. O.k , the story is just too flat. I mean , this space  ship flys around and every time it tacklls a problem the only one who's  able to solve it is Grosvner , all the other scientists are self-centered  impotents.<br />And besides that , the way the problem just &quot;fall&quot;  on the crew when the're finished with the last one - too &quot;Star trek  adventures&quot; for me to buy as serius sci-fi , since I know how Van-Vogt  can write.<br />BUT - nextialism is nice. more than that , I think that it  could work. As always , the aliens are interesting , well thought-of , and  unusual. And there's that master's writing style - I can't put my finger on  it , but Van-Vogt just know's how to make you swallow the book instead of  reading it. If you're interested in reading full-potential Van-Vogt read  :&quot;The silkie&quot; , &quot;Empire of the atom&quot;&amp;&quot;Wizard  of lin&quot; , &quot;A world of null-a&quot;&amp;&quot;The players of  null-a&quot; and &quot;Slan&quot;.<br />Bye.	2000-06-10

Sam has , over the years , changed his mind about the way  he and his peers rule the masses and the story is actually the story of  Sam's rebellion in the gods.<br />All written in the wonderfull proze of  Zelazny with amazing insights into man's soul , but with Zelazny that's not  really amazing since all of his works are infact pilosophical quaries of  man's place in the world and such.<br />&quot;Lord of light&quot; is one of  the best soft sci-fi books ever written , I recommend it warmly to anyone  at all and to those who are interested in sci-fi in particular.	2000-06-08

The foundations for the basic backround of &quot;Known-space&quot; are laid here.<br />The story itself is of Larry Grinberg and Kzanol the thrint-an &quot;enslaver&quot; bilion years old who crashed into earth and got stuck  in his stasis-suit protection system.<br />Since objects in stasis are perfect  mirors , when Kzanol is found he's treated as the  &quot;sea-statue&quot;.<br />Larry , a human telepath who works with dolphins  , agrees to try and read the sea-statue's thoughts when a friend suggests  he's an alien in stasis.<br />Kzanol , who's powerfull psionic powers allow  him to enslave (allmost!) any  intelligent being , is awakend into the  connection with the human telepath. As a result , Larry thinks he's Kzanol  and starts a race against the real Kzanol towards neptun inorder to reach  Kzanol's spare space-suit which is also in stasis , and has in it a kind of  telepatic-enhancer that will allow whoever finds it first to overcome the  other and control earth ( a common thrint aspiration ).<br />The end I will  leave untold. It is a good book , nothing more , and I recommend it  particularlly to those avid sci-fi and Niven fans as myself , that have to  read every Known-space story , if only to the purpose of saying-&quot;I've  read'em all!&quot;	2000-06-08

This book , though , IS one of my favorites.<br />The basic premise is that for unknown millions of years the world and it's  surroundings have been in a kind of force-field - one that slows down  electricity.<br />Since we've been under it's influence before we became  intelligent , when it's influence is lifted from our brains , all the  living beings on earth becomes three or four times as intelligent as  before.<br />One cute point : It is possible that earth entry into this  force-field is what killed the dinosaurs.<br />Some die , some are not able to  deal with their new abilities and become insane and some , as always ,  carry on.<br />The way Anderson developes that basic brilliant premise is  remarkeble. It is well written and very interesting. The book has not one  but a couple of heroes , and it's following them in their dealing with the  change and their activities as super-geniuses. Very recommended.	2000-06-08

Allthough it lacks the unrelenting agglutination to proved science ( which I'm all for ), it has other great adventages ; It's huge scope-as a child it really shown me  for the first time that man's mind and curiosity know no bounds. The way  man-in the story- is just another type of creature and nothing more , that  has taught me humility.<br />THE PLOT : chronologicaly we're millions of years  in the future. the earth is no longer revolving on it's axis , and show one  side to the sun constantly.<br />A huge , single tree has taken over the whole  lit side of earth , and all the life that exist live under it's shadow (if  it's strong and wild enaugh to survive), or on and between the branches (if  it's feeble like the 30cm green humans).<br />It's the story of Gant.  A human  that has glimpses of racial-memory through an intelligent fungus that has  taken over him , and has it's own reasons to gain manouevrability and take  Gant on a trek across the world and even to moon.<br />A book written in the  old style of sci-fi , which I call &quot;pre-campbellian&quot;.<br />Very ,  very recommended.	2000-06-02

The book is about a french knight who is reborn over and over again and an arabian immortal sorcerer thet opposes him. Through out the centuries they fight until they confront each other for the last time in the 21  century.<br />Being a Zelazny fan i was a bit let down at first read. But  after a few more reads i became a little more simpathetic. The book is just  not &quot;pure&quot; Zelazny , not wholly writen in the style i love so  much , so i can understand those Zelazny fans thet gave the book low  scores.

Again and again , Alfred Elton Van-Vogt shows the rest of the world the richness of his imagination.<br />This time we enter an empire of humans at war with the Rull race- insects with the ability to control the light  pattern of their exso-skeleton , thus they are able to create the illusion  of any apearence- even human.<br />To say the truth , like one of the previous  reviewers , I also have the feeling that the whole story is just a part of  a much bigger one.<br />It's just that Van Vogt does'nt let you know and  understand all that you want to. And that creates this feeling of something  missing.<br />The book as a whole is a great adventure , with a great  backround story , and the end is remarkeble , a truely Van Vogtian ending.  It's a book I recommend to pre-campbellian readers.	2000-05-31

Slan is a great exemple of practically a perfect simple-plot , one-hero , sci-fi story.<br />Now , before you're clicking &quot;not helpfull&quot; , you have to understand that you are used to a writing style that has taken over  the sci-fi scene in the 40's and 50's.    A style led by John w.Campbell ,  and writers like Asimov , Clarck and Heinlin. Those people decided for you  what sci-fi should be. Generally , they were right , most of the writers at  that time had lower standards for sci-fi stories.<br />But not Van Vogt.   Allthough his style is'nt compatible with &quot;Campbellian&quot; standards  , his writing has a different magic. Enormous scope , fantastic imagination  , and very special lead charecters , are only part of something that I  cannot put into words , and flows free in his works.<br />You should not judge  &quot;Slan&quot; by today's standards , instead , give it a chance and  enjoy the magic of the early style science fiction.	2000-05-31

I cant understand why sci-fi readers don't treat it  as they treat &quot;Dune&quot; adleast. Really! Has no one taken the time  to truly absorb what this book has to offer?

There's the electromagnetic spectrum , the  &quot;rodomagnetic&quot; spectrum , and the psichic spectrum.<br />Offcourse  it's explained in a much more gripping way and is actually very interesting  and well writen.                                           I forgot to  mention thet the robots claim to act for the best of humanity , and all the  restrictions are for the better of the peaple confined.

The &quot;Fluben&quot; are the most interesting aliens i've read about except maybe the &quot;Moties&quot; from &quot;The mote in god's  eye&quot;. They are very diffrent anatomically from human beings ,which is  logical ,and they are all mathematical geniuses. They're all brain. that  is, their whole body ( which is a cloud of a dense fluid hovering in the  ocean )is allso the thinking organ. They can become smaller, tighter and  harder, form a &quot;rock&quot; and in that state they are even more smart  then usual ( and the usual is something like 400 i.q's ). Another thing  about this book is that the aliens and the humans don't fight, they  get  along and like each other. the opponent is nature. Buy the book, it's an  interesting read.	2000-05-30

US	52261586	R2R6IHDROTAPRK	0881849804	27573566	The Mind Cage (Masters of Science Fiction)	Books	4	2	5	N	N	Not one of his best, but still VAN-VOGT.	This is a well-built book. Allthough not one of those crazy, mind-blowing, and half psichodellic books that van-vogt often unleashes at us, its a good one. It has the tipical plot twists and lead charecter that makes you  think-&quot; Damn! now that's a man!&quot;, and ofcourse a few females that  cant be trusted. Buy it if youre a van-vogt fan or if you want to  &quot;taste&quot; him but consider yourself a &quot;down to earth sci-fi  reader&quot;.	2000-05-26

Fast paced, but not deep. Interesting, but not memorable charecters. The plot is somewhat confused, as if babbled without preceeding  thougt. It felt as though I've realy read parts of a book instead of a  whole one.	2000-05-26
US	52261586	R13TJETYVVK87M	067155977X	737085329	Between the Strokes of Night	Books	5	12	15	N	N	It is simply one of the best  100 sci-fi books ever writen.	I dont why i've always thougt that BTSON is writen in the same style of Larry niven. Exellent science, cool charecters ( the kind that can take care of themselves in any situation ), and really amzing ideas about big  things like immortality, and about small things like the fact that in  s-state everything looks a bit different because of pseudo-red shift.  Anyway, allthough im a big Niven fan, this time Sheffield took Niven in his  own style. get this book. Its really a masterpiece. Its a shame that  sheffield is not acknowledged as the giant he is.	2000-05-26

Some real good advanced biothechnology,intristing lead charecter,good plot. He really took his time and thoght about all kinds of human forms. Get the trilogy,if you know  whats good hard science fiction is.	2000-04-15

I'm 20 years old and i've been reading sci-fi for 12 years. From Orson scot card to Phillip hoze farmer, From ROGER ZEALAZNEY to LARRY NIVEN, From Frank herbert to  Robert heinlein etc,Iv'e realy read alot. In the last year i've been  exploring the early sci-fi, the writers thet wrote in a  style thet can be  described as pre-Campbellian. Allthough I admire the minds of contemporery  giants such as CHARLES SHEFFILD for exemple, There's magic in the writings  of Van-Vogt. Pre-Campbellian, free from constricting patterns of sci-fi as  opposed to Fantasy, and derived from Super-science, almost all the books of  A.E.VAN-VOGT are pure pleasure and delight to serius  science fiction  reader.	2000-01-12
