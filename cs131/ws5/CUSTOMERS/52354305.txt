US	52354305	R1T7XGINFIOTDD	1893007170	333924409	Alcoholics Anonymous: The Big Book	Books	5	27	44	N	N	Old Timer or Bleeding Deacon? Choose	I am Mike, and I am grateful to a loving God, who chose me to be an alcoholic, addict, and CoDA. <br /> The stories found in this Fourth Edition of the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous, the Basic Sacred Scripture for the Church of the Non-Drinking, are a definite upgrade to the Third Edition, which led me to not drinking on May 28, 1978. <br /> However, even this Fourth Edition is not tamper-free. The First through Third Printings of this Fourth Edition contained the following sentence on page xxiv: \\"Fundamentally, though, the difference between an electronic meeting and the home group is only one of format.\\" The Printings of January and February 2002 carried this sentence, whereas the Fourth Printing, of April 2002 deleted it. <br /> Similarly, there is a nationwide brouhaha concerning the changed punctuation of Dr. Bob Smith's story from the Third Edition to the Fourth Edition, perhaps a tempest in a teapot, full of sound and fury signifying personalities over principles. The first 164 pages are considered inerrant, and cannot be changed by the successors to Bob and Bill. However, Dr. Bob's story does not fall within this 1986 ukase. One also notes that the Copyrights on the First and Second Editions were not renewed; hence, all of the materials contained therein may be changed, edited, and redacted without recourse to GSO. The same is not true for international editions, since they are protected under the more liberal standards of post-1976 U.S. copyright norms. <br /> Despite criticism, the 4th Edition does not use inclusive language in the first 164 pages, nor change the patristic Chapter to the Wives. [N.B. It is generally known that Bill W. did not write the Chapter to the Employers, nor, apparently, the Chapter to the Wives.] The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Editions were unnecessarily misogynistic in extremis. The traditional/historical pages do not reflect that, currently, over 40% of AAs are female. At the time the Big Book was drafted, there were no female AAs. [The First Edition has one female story, which was not carried over to the 2nd Edition.] Dr. Bob refused to sponsor women, after an early 13th Step. [See &quot;Dr. Bob and the Good Old Timers.&quot;] Further many have great difficulty in affixing the male gender pronouns to their own Higher Power. [This also reflects AA's early Christian Trinitarian creeds of the Oxford Group, which is unacceptable to those not holding with traditional theology/dogma. {The Mimeo Edition used the phrase \\"God as I understand God\\" rather than the printed version of \\"God as I understand &quot;Him&quot;.}\\" <br /> The multilith/typed version of the Big Book [available from GSO upon request] contained 20 stories from the 1938 membership of less than 80. [One story, &quot;Ace Full - Seven Eleven&quot;, did not make it from the Multilith edition to the 1st edition. One 1st edition story, &quot;Lone Endeavor&quot;, did not make it into the second printing of the 1st edition.] Nineteen of the original multilith stories were included in the 1st edition, and ten more stories were added to the multilith collection for the 1st edition since the Big Book was skimpy in contents, despite being printed on extra thick paper, and was packaged and priced as a 1939 coffee-table book @ $3.50.  <br /> The cost of printing each First Edition Big Book was 35, for an anticipated profit of 1,000%. These anticipated profits were to be used for treatment centers and missionaries. [The minimum wage in 1939 was 25 per hour = 14 hours of labor needed to purchase a copy of the Big Book. The equivalent 2004 price for the Big Book would be $70!]  <br /> The Fourth Edition of the Big Book has been reduced in price from the Third Edition, since substantial royalties are no longer paid to Lois Wilson's nieces and nephews, and to Bill Wilson's former mistress. <br /> Bill Wilson restructured the 1st edition in 1955. Only two stories from the 1st edition were retained intact. Three were edited, one of which was retitled. Twostories were completely rewritten, and 30 new stories were added to the 2nd edition for a total of 38 stories. The 1st edition, first printing, had 30 stories. The 1st and 2nd editions of the Big Book and the stories contained therein are in the Public Domain, i.e. not subject to copyright restrictions. <br /> The 3rd edition contained only 10 additional stories not found in the 2nd edition. Twelve of the stories in the 3rd edition were credited to &quot;The A.A. Grapevine, Inc.&quot;, a personal newsletter originated by Bill Wilson to communicate directly to the membership. [This data crediting &quot;The A.A. Grapevine, Inc.&quot; was omitted from the later printings of the 3rd edition.] Five of the stories in the 4th edition are credited to &quot;The A.A. Grapevine, Inc.&quot; <br /> In the early printings of the Big Book, stories were dropped if the author had gone back to drinking. [Mrs. Marty Mann is an exception, and her story from the Second Edition, not the first woman's story that is found only in the First Edition, remains in the Fourth Edition.] The Non Approved History of AA 1957-1985 states, page 203: \\"By 1953, [when the Second Edition replaced the First Edition] it was evident that the personal stories in the first edition of the Big Book were somewhat dated. Of the 28 [New York and Cleveland] veterans whose stories were represented [Akron was opposed to the book project], five had gone back to drinking, eight more had slipped after the book was published but had come back to A.A., and 15 had remained continuously sober.\\" <br /> Almost all of the stories dropped from the 1st & 2nd editions were omitted due to the authors' relapses. Cultural changes were the predominant rationale for deletions from the 3rd edition and for inclusion of new stories in the 4th edition. <br /> Of some significance are the changes to the mantra, &quot;How It Works&quot;, which is read aloud at almost all Twelve Step Meetings. {I have encountered AA meetings, which omit reading &quot;How It Works&quot;, as well as omitting reading &quot;The Twelve Traditions&quot;!} Further, this mantra was substantially redacted from the version given to Bill Wilson, as set forth in the manuscript version. The manuscript version preaches to its reader using \\"you\\" throughout, whereas the sacrosanct version refers to \\"We.\\" Step Seven originally read: \\"Humbly, on our knees, asked Him to remove our shortcomings - holding nothing back.\\" The Twelfth Step was also worded that AA would not limit itself to alcoholics: \\"Having had a spiritual experience as the result of [this course of action], [changed to &quot;these steps&quot;] we tried to carry this message to other[s, especially] [changed to other] alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.\\" <br /> The manuscript version also ended with a harsh encomium: \\"If you are not convinced on these vital issues, you ought to re-read the book to this point [e.g. prior to the personal stories] or else throw it away!\\" <br /> Many of us were saved, not by the first 164 pages [the book to this point] but the stories of experience strength, and hope found thereafter. Therefore, this Fourth Edition is strongly commended to all those affected by any addiction. Moreover, do not let the fuss and feathers of the non-ordained bleeding deacons keep you from trudging the road to happy destiny. <br />	2004-08-04

[cf. \\"The Zen of Farting, p.25.]  The same source refers to \\"especially deadly farts  . . .as silent but deadly and silent but violent.\\"  This describes Walter's emissions accurately and succinctly.  The drawings add to the vivid language in Walter, with a more than slight purple haze in each one. I especially liked the scene in the doctor's office, where Dr. Bob Smith, a proctologist of AA fame, cannot cure the Beano resistant WMD.<br />One also remembers the unexpurgated Hamlet asking Laetares \\"Whether 'tis nobler to Fart and bear the Shame, or not to Fart and bear the Pain?\\" <br />Hence one must give to all historians, Benjamin Franklyn's \\"A Letter to A Royal Academy\\", 1781, proposing a Project: \\"To discover some Drug wholesome and not disagreeable, to be mixed with our common Food, or Sauces, that shall render the Natural Discharges of Wind from our Bodies, not only inoffensive, but agreeable as Perfumes..\\" But such a Drug, would have prevented Walter from rallying to his family's defense when their property was in peril.	2003-10-06

Being somewhat familar with this genre, I was quite amused with the back alley tidbits with which Buckley sprinkles this light hearted tome.  Unfortunately, another work on Angleton, &quot;Cold Warrior&quot; does not give us a &quot;House of Mirrors&quot; portrait of Angelton to pose against Buckley's oh-so-clever innuendo &amp; Georgetown gossip. But it is fascinating to see how Buckley portrays the Philby-Angelton connection, with Golitsyn as a Soviet disinformation Mephistopheles to feed Angeltons alcoholic paranoid delusions.<br />One wonders if Angelton really slept with the murdered-on-the-Towpath Kennedy mistress, and retreived her diary to protect JFK or himself? Although Buckley mentions Hollis in passing [together with Burgess, Maclean, Philby &amp; Blunt],the book ends with a sardonic choice: Was Colby or Angelton the Fifth Man of the latest version of The Trust? Both were not responsible for the Ames/Hanssen round, but both were in place during the Walker  &amp; Falcon/Snowman runs. Was Pollard an Angelton protege, ala Crespi? The Lovestone comments are worth the price of admission, albeit the technique was used by Nixon against Allende.<br />One appreciates Buckley's discussion of the damage caused by NSA's Martin &amp; Mitchell, and the Army Driver who was exempt from full searches entering and leaving No Such Agency, since he ran bootleg errands for the top NSA brass, before Costco &amp; Sam's Club displaced the Fort Meade Exchange &amp; Commissary.<br />Orchids to orchids and dust to dust, <BR>if the booze don't get you, Nosenko must.<br />hUMPTY dUMPTY	2003-09-24

This tort feasor is the latest prurient excruience from Grisham's less than mighty pen.<BR>As many have noted, Grisham takes up a current topic, in this case the Class Action law suit, and builds an autobiographical less than tour de force to teach the ignorant masses that which passes all understanding.<BR>Barely disguised in this novella, are  the phen-fen, thalidomide, and other drug histories caused by greed, need, and speed to finish the novel within his contracted for 372 pages.  Race Horse Haynes must be amuzized by Grisham's portrayal.<BR>The plot starts out with a nice premise: a new drug to replace 12-Step pogams for the addicted works as claimed: it makes the hopeless clean and sober within a respectable period of time.  But with a flaw, a small percentage of its users become homicidal because of its side effects.  Grisham's distaste for those addicted, particularly those of African American ethnicity seeps through like mold under a wet carpet.<BR>From there, the young burnt out antihero becomes morally filthy, as well as filthy wealthy, and like a modern Candide, his descent into legal torment without any scruples leads us to a Dante Paradisio.<BR>So, with all this, the reader is the true hero of each and every Grisham work: the true hero is the person, like this Hon. reviewer, who reads the book to its diminished  ending. Abandon hope all ye who enter Grisham's incompleteness, wait for the movie, and rent it from Blockbuster.	2003-05-30

Although Wise's book leaves many unanswered questions, \\"Spy\\" is definitely one of the best. Hanssen does rank with Aldrich Ames, but one is still left to wonder what actual harm did these two do to the National Security of the United States?<BR>  <BR>     P>     But like Tad Szulc's \\"To Kill the Pope,\\" this volume has not answered many of the questions surrounding Opus Dei and Hanssen's affiliation with that flagellic cult. Thus if one follows the money paid Hanssen, one finds that it leads directly to Opus Dei coffers, e.g. tuition payments of Hanssen's children to attend the Opus Dei schools, Oakcrest for his girls, and the Heights for the boys.  It is illustrative that this Catholic convert was told by his confessor to turn over his early Soviet payments to Mother Theresa, of Christopher Hitchens' \\"The Missionary Position\\" repute.  The Nobel Prize winning nun also had Charles Keating and Baby Doc as sources of funds. Hanssen's wife agreed that this was an appropriate penance for his sins of expionage on behalf of \\"godless\\" Communism.<br />     Opus Dei's prelature even stepped in to urge Hanssen's wife not to make no statements about her husband since that might delay its founder's elevation to sainthood by John Paul II.<BR>Louis Freeh, head of the FBI was a fellow parishioner of Hanssen's which may explain why other FBI Opus Dei acolytes were hesitant to pursue a member of Opus Dei Study Center or Catholic Information Center, which was staffed by an Opus Dei priest, Rev. C. John Mc Closkey, and located a short distance  from the J. Edgar Hoover headquarters. Other fellow parishioners were Justices Scalia and Thomas.<br />     So yet another paradox needs to be added to Joan Estruch's \\"Saints & Schemers: Opus Dei and its Paradoxes\\" to join Jack Dunn's \\"The Vatican Boys: A Novel about Church Corruption.\\"<br />A.M.D.G.	2003-05-30

Many of us demented ones have a huge sigh of relief, when all the eliminations are done, and the only culprit remaining is Alzheimer's,<BR>This is not a book for those professionals who are determined to establish that those of us with the disease have no valid information to share with them.  This is not a book for those who are only interested in working with the caregivers.  This is not a book for those who say why do anything meaningful, since we won't remember the patterns anyhow.  This is not a book for those who flaunt memory improvement exercises which deny the loss of the ability to learn. This is not a book for those who talk, but do not listen.  It is a book for the rest of us.<BR>Her main title says it all for this ALZer: \\"Just Love Me.\\"  But this love comes at a high price in the face of vincible ignorance.<BR>We will talk, even if the words are jumbled.  We will read, even if the continuity disappears.  We will listen, even if the sentences disappear into a black hole.  But most of all, we will love, even when we are not loved by those around us.<BR>Lee has shown us the way out of our tunnels of loneliness and despair.<BR>Lee says: \\"I know there are many people out there who neeeed to hear from others, like themselves, that it's okay to goof up; it's okay to do stupid things; it's part of what's happening to this body and brain. But it doesn't have to be all bad.  There is so much good, and so much you can still do.  So what if you can't remember somebody's name.  You can still say hello to a little old lady.  You can still give flowers to soneone .  You can still look at the ocean [like I did on a Senir Retreat last week] and say, 'Oh God, I'm so lucky.'\\"  And thanks to this book, that is exactly how I will spend my time remaining.

Before I saw the movie, I bought the book, John Bayley's, &quot;Iris, A Memoir,&quot; but have not been able to finish it, one of my CRS symptoms is an inability to read as I used to. Then I saw the movie, and it was as confusing to me as &quot;Godsford Park,&quot; because of the convoluted story line: e.g., ALZ has rendered such works as CSI and West Wing totally incomprehensible.<br />I wondered, in my ignorance, who the heck was Iris Murdoch, and why all the fuss and feathers.<br />Then I bought this gem of a book by Nicol. I am transported. The text, with telling quotes and illustrations, tells me what I have overlooked, pre-ALZ. Do I feel guilty as an Emeritus Professor in resorting to the Classic Comics of the 21st Century?<br />Not in the slightest: Nicol puts forth one idea in serial fashion and for the first time I understand rational humanism, existentialism, selfism &amp; Simone Weill.<br />Murdoch defines my AA Higher power as &quot;A single perfect transcendent non-representational and necessarily real object of attention.&quot; I can live with that in preference to the Ontology of Neo-Scholasticism of my own undergraduate daze.<br />I am indebted to Nicol for pointing out Murdoch's notion of love as the ideal of attention: &quot;When we really love someone (rather than just lusting after them or seeing them as someone who can improve our self-image)--we are really seeing them. . . We become so immersed in them that we actually forget ourselves for a moment. We obliterate our self by attempting to empathize with another.&quot; [And CODA be damned.]<br /><br />Therefore, I am truly grateful for this &quot;trot.&quot; It gives me what I can no longer do for myself, due to my own data overload ALZ deterioration.

A Different Kind of Hero	Books	5	9	10	N	N	A Valuable & Worthwhile Addition to this Alcoholic's Library	It is amazing how much valuable information the author has packed into this short 64pp volume.  And the pictures, many of which have not appeared elsewhere in the hagiography of Bill Wilson, make this volume one of a kind. Although the publisher indicates that it is directed to the Ala-Teen and Ala-Tot audiences, those 10 to 14, this 71+ multi-diagnosed addict and alcoholic recommends it to those with the diseases of addiction and alcoholism, as well as those surrounding we chosen ones. [\\"I am grateful that God chose me to be an alcoholic and an addict.\\"]<br />I was particularly gratified when the author correctly states how the name \\"Alcoholics Anonymous\\" came to be identified with Bill W.'s organization; e.g. Cleveland, the \\"Brewmaster\\", adopted the name from the book, and the larger organization took the name from Cleveland.  White also gives Bill's drinking buddy and sponsor, Ebby Thatcher, proper credit for Bill's last drink. White also points out that Bob Smith did not recover on-the-spot from talking with Bill Wilson, but instead went directly to a bender.<br />White does shy away from diagnosing Bill's bi-polar disorder, but does not omit the symptoms. <br />This reader hopes that the author will turn his eye, and add succinct biographies of Mrs. Marty Mann and Lois Wilson to what promises to be a most worthwhile series. [Mann, who like Clarence Snyder eschewed anonymity, was responsible for more persons coming to AA than the Saturday Evening Post article.]<br />I will use this volume in the future with my more recalcitrant pigeons.	2003-03-31

I found many good ones: Cohen, \\"Loss of Self;\\" Powell, \\"Alzheimer's Disease: A Guide for Families;\\" Hodgson, \\"Alzheimer's: Finding the Words;\\" Jones, \\"Gentle Care;\\" and especially Small, \\"The Memory Bible;\\" and Shenk, \\"The Forgetting.\\"  All of these treat the person diagnosed with ALZ with respect, since \\"There's Still a Person in There\\" [Castelman].<br />       Now we come to Kuhn's opus minor. Here I am reminded of the climatic scene in the book \\"Hannibal.\\" Lector has seized the FBI Supervisor Paul Krendler {Ray Liotta in the movie}, has sliced off the top of Krendler's cranium, and is serving up slices of fried brain, with fava beans.  Kuhn somewhat resembles Anthony Hopkins in his condescending regard for those of us with ALZ. It is interesting to note that a \\"Daniel Kuhn\\" has posted two reviews on , one of this book {} and one on DeBaggio, \\"Losing My Mind.\\"  The latter posting rivals Lector's exploits in \\"Red Dragon\\" with its cruelty towards DeBaggio.<br />     Nevertheless, one cannot accuse Kuhn of false advertising: his subtitle indicates that his book is \\"A Guide for Family Members and Friends.\\"  By the principle of inclusis unis, exclusis alterius, one can conclude that he did not intend his book to be read by facilitators, therapists, and other professionals in the ALZ field, as well as those of us who have \\"windows of clarity\\" as this insidious affliction takes us in its downward spiral.  Since I am neither a family member nor a friend, I cannot speak, except as one who regards his label as a challenge, rather than as the Kuhn suggested stigmata or disgrace.<br />    Thus, it is an affront to a person with diagnosed ALZ to state that \\"the decision about disclosing the diagnosis must be weighed in light of the needs of the person with [ALZ] and the needs of others.\\" [p.113]. On the previous page, he mentions with obvious distaste those \\"peoplewith the disease [who] sometimes have an uncanny ability in the early stages to \\"rise to the occasion\\" and [have the efrontery to] hide the symptoms.\\"<BR>We don't hide the symptoms, or hide from the symptoms, we face the symptoms, and adapt to them. But to do this would require Kuhn and others of his ilk to communicate with us, so that we can \\"Speak Our Minds,\\" Snyder.<br />     Although Kuhn claims more than 25 years as a clinical social worker in the fields of aging and health care, he has been a MSW since 1987, and is currently director of education for the Mather chain of assisted living.  His book claims director of eductation at the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center in August 1999, but Mather states that he joined their auspices in 1999.  As an Emeritus Professor, I am well aware of the student jibe that \\"Those who do, Do.  Those who can't, Teach. Those who can't teach, Teach Teachers. And, Those who can't teach teachers, become Deans or Education Directors.\\"  Kuhn demonstrates the truth of that folk observation in every chapter. <br />   Since I am looking at this book from the standpoint of one who is diagnosed with ALZ, his Chapter 9 on \\"What is it like to have Alzheimer's Disease\\" deserves most crucial scrutiny.  Here he points out \\"that only five books have been authored by people with [ALZ], written with the help of their loved ones.\\" He has not spoken with any of us who keep journals, diaries, et al, at considerable emotional energy expenditures, since he regards these five as \\"[PROBABLY] exceptional individuals with a high degree of awareness about their disease who [RETAINED] a remarkable ability to communicate.\\" [p. 81, emphasis added.]Au contraire, if Kuhn were to attend some ALZ-only sharing groups, unhindered by his displayed ignorance, he would learn that most of us are keenly aware of our disease, and can communicate that awareness to those that have \\"ears to listen, and eyes to see.\\"<br />     Oh yes, some of us are dually diagnosed with major unipolar depression as well as ALZ, and we add Prozac and Wellbutrin to our daily Donepezil.  If we were holistic physicians we would prescribe human kindness and empathy to Kuhn's daily regimen, but he would likely not to stick to his medication because of the side effects. As for Kuhn's revision, one would hope that he will include some qualitative research as well as his quantatative surveys, which are useless for individuals and those around them. Otherwise, Uvis aridior puer passis quae suco caret ut putrisque pumex.	2002-10-14

Unlike Kuhn's \\"Alzheimer's Early Stages\\" who offers a Prozac to those of us who defy his Polyannish view of a CRS' mental functioning without seeking insights from those who remain lucid and analytical and rational within, despite our infrequent \\"windows of clarity\\", McGowan tells it like it is for some of us: warts, fistulae, et al.  She does not hold back from her anger, depression and increased libido.

My own CRS has caused me to  become unable to view complicated movies such as &quot;Iris&quot; and &quot;Godsford Park&quot; or multilayered television such as &quot;West Wing&quot; or &quot;CSI.&quot; Similarly, the ability to complete reading a book more than 3 or 4 pages at a time has departed, never to return. But, like when I received &quot;The Forgetting&quot; by Shenk, I was able to read this 207 page saga, cover to cover, in less than a single 24 hour time span, aka &quot;one day&quot;.  My window of clarity, which happens less than once a quarter, gave me the grace to assimilate deBaggio's message, just as I was able to do before I became an Emeritus Professor in 1993.<br />   The writing by DeBaggio is superb, his poetry shines on every page! And he has been blessed with outsanding collaborators and editors who polished his rough diamond into the superb blue white gem which &quot;Losing My Mind&quot; is.  De Baggio does NOT record a descent to madness, but rather an ascent into a Mount Carmel of shining sanity, despite his testimony to the contrary. The literature of ALZ is overwhelmed with desciptions, diagnoses,and understandings for/of the saintly Caregivers and facilitators who guide our descent into a Dante inferno. BUT, there is next to nothing wherein the person diagnosed with Alzheimer's tells us what is going on inside their crania.  &quot;Speaking with Alzheimer's&quot; and &quot;Into the Labyrinth [out-of-print]&quot; are two other exceptions.  <br />    Once we are diagnosed, it is as if we no longer are sentient human beings, capable of intellectual cognition.  Our ability to convery our intelligence and meanings to others does deteriorate rapidly, particulary with aphasia, but the human entity is still thereand functioning even though the ability to respond has vanished: i.e. a CRSer hears and understands all that is said in his/her presence, even though the ALZer cannot communicate that understanding.<BR>    Inspired by DeBaggio, I, too, have commenced a Journal of sorts, with the hope of telling others exactly what my sensations are as my hippocampus turns into Gorgonzola. {In my own situation, I have rewired my brain to eliminate frustration over a lack of word recall, and working memory recall, with the help of positive reinforcement, Qi Gong Nirvana state deep meditation, Vitamin B6, B12,E, and Aricet. Thus I have forced a window of clarity to write this critique, and DeBaggio has given this clinically diagnosed unipolar Depressive and CRSer hope that he can aid others before I am unable to lift my head or swallow.  Like DeBaggio, the light at the end of my tunnel is an ALZ locomotive, at full speed, headed towards my demise, yet like him, I hope I can locate an agent, collaborator, and editor, so that my own Pilgrim's Progress will be a gift to my seven children and eleven grandchildren, {I include Andrew!}, when the words jumble and chaos reigns supreme, as it already has commenced.<BR>Thank you very much Thomas, for your Augustinian &quot;Confession!&quot; I wish all of us fellow travelors, a &quot;Safe Return.&quot;	2002-09-26

In 1999, to inaugurate the 2000 Holy Year, the Vatican issued a commemorative postage stamp honored the first and {hopefully} last Spanish Pope, Alexander VI. Was Opus Dei, a Spanish cult dating from Franco, responsible for this embarassment? Most curious.<br />In 2002, a world-wide sex scandal has enveloped the Church of Christ.  However, the Vatican, which does not read the media, nor allow scandal to reach the ears of the current Pontiff, except via his personal Polish secretary, has reacted as if this were a small theft worthy of a hush-up at all levels. Curioser, and Curioser.<br />Hence, it is worthy to revisit the era when the Roman Church was also in a disaster mode, worth of Cardinals Law and Egan and Mahoney and Bernadin. And Puzo does the joy of portraying the Borgia Pope in all his noteriety, as a loving father who adds to the gene pool via his own progeny, ala Romeo & Juliet, and their issue, Rodrigo.<br />For a tale of fiction, to be read as a summer recreation, \\"The Family\\" is repetitive and drags.  However, if I wanted one of my ten grandchildren or former students to know what the Council of Trent, Savonorola, the Counter Reformation, and the Jesuit \\"freedom fighters\\" of 1600, were up to, this volume would be a first choice to whet their curiosity and lead them to drink further into Church History, as it really was, not just \\"The Bad Popes\\". The inner cover maps depict how the Papal States strangled Italy until Gerabaldi did what Cesare was not able to accomplish.<br />When I acquired this from Amazon, they did not stock it, and I had to buy it used at a high price.  It is/was worth it! Now that they stock it and the pb, get either while they are still in print.  It does indeed put present day clerical corruption ala Boston and Hartford into a perspective.  If the Church could survive Alexander, Cesare, Lucretia, and their do-it-together child, Rodrigo, then the Church that exalts a \\"blockhead\\" [correct trans. for petrus!] as the first successor toJesus, will definitely survive the current imbroglio.<br />It is not scholarly, nor a good novel, and is a tedious read, yet Puzo and his partner of 20 years Gino, rate 5 stars for the end result.

He ordered a CAT scan, and referred me to my psychiatrist, who was supervising my intensive outpatient treatment of Major [unipolar] Suicidal Depression. The CAT scan depicted some small white areas, which could have been the result of undetected minor strokes or tertiary syphilis. Since neither was applicable to my medical history nor my life style, only the remote possibility of ALZ remained. The psychiatrist gave me the Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE], and I scored less than twenty-five. Based on the MMSE results, he then scheduled me for a battery of tests. My suspicions were confirmed: I now have a diagnosis of \\"probable ALZ\\" in the early or middle stages. I am now one of the \\"five million...When \\"The Forgetting\\" arrived, I sat down and devoured it from cover to cover in two days! This was most unusual, since two of the early memory symptoms of ALZ are my recent inability to finish a book cover to cover, or to pick up a book or article where I had left off, and continue on the textual journey.<BR>This \\"magnificent synthesis of history, science, politics, psychology, and profound human drama\\" was written especially for me, someone newly diagnosed as \\"probable ALZ.\\" \\"Delving into such diverse areas as art history, literature, genetics, and neurobiology\\" Shenk's \\"The Forgetting Alzheimer's\\" clear and concise exegesis continues to give me the data I require to comfort an unbelieving and devastated significant other, my spouse.<BR>Like the forty-two stories contained in the newly-published \\"Fourth Edition of Alcoholics Anonymous,\\" Shenk's marvelous treatise posits what it was like, what happened, and where the afflictedof ALZ are, and gives me experience, strength, and hope. The personal anecdotes, as well as the detailed case histories of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Jonathan Swift, Fredrick Law Olmsted, and Ronald Reagan, show me where I have been and what lies ahead in the early, middle, and final stages of ALZ.<BR>Shenk's Yellow Brick Road stretches invitingly ahead of me, and has given me the knowledge and courage to face the challenge ahead: the inevitable, irreversible, and presently incurable ALZ which is now occupying major portions of my hippocampus. Knowing what lies ahead gives me the hope I need to face my confrontation with \\"probable ALZ.\\" I do not need the false Sirenic lure of: \\"Maybe, just maybe, my diagnosis is incorrect.\\"<BR>Unlike Dylan Thomas, I propose to \\"go gentle into that dark night\\" of final ALZ, and with Shenk's \\"The Forgetting Alzheimer's\\" to \\"be by my side,\\" I now have the data to provide care to/for my significant other, who is devastated by this insidious disease, which afflicts her husband, lover, and strong oak tree, as I go forward and downward into this long dark slide.<BR>There are many, many, books and resources written for and available to the caregivers and professionals who surround those of us afflicted with ALZ. There are few and scanty resources that level with the afflicted party/client/victim. This slender volume meets my needs, goals, and thirst for data and knowledge, in language that is clear and succinct. As I write this review, I am rereading \\"The Forgetting Alzheimer's\\" again and again because my short term/working memory ain't what it used to be. With luck and repetition, I hope to implant it in my long term depository, which is currently functioning at an academic level, thank you.

With all the furor concerning &quot;Hitler's Pope&quot; by Cornwell, I wondered how he had obtained access to the expurgated-by-Jebbie files on Pius XII? With some difficulty, Amazon located an out-of-print copy of Cornwell's earlier debunking of the conspiracy theories surrounding the Year of Three Popes, when Papa Luciani, John Paul I, died after a pontificate of only thirty-three days. When I received my virgin copy of &quot;Thief&quot; still sealed in clear plastic, I knew I was in for a treat: The front and back cover blurbs waxed enthusiastic with atta-boys from Graham Greene &quot;The Power and the Glory,&quot; Andrew Greeley &quot;The Tablet,&quot; and Malachi Martin &quot;The Jesuits.&quot;  I was not disappointed: Cornwell weaves a tale worthy of G.K. Chesterton &quot;Father Brown.&quot;  Cornwell's forensic investigation is more compelling than that of Tad Szulc's work of fiction which is also &quot;based on real events, facts, and persons: the attempt to assassinate John Paul II on May 13, 1981, its aftermath, and the secret investigation conducted subsequently at the behest of the Holy See.&quot; [&quot;To Kill the Pope&quot; was released in 2000, &quot;Thief in the Night&quot; in 1989.]<br />This is truly &quot;an exhaustive and impressive study&quot; as Cornwell narrows in on what really happened to the author of &quot;Letters to Pinnochio,&quot; which I found most revealing of the Patriarch of Milan. Cornwell gives a most telling picture of Archbishop Paul Casmir &quot;Chink&quot; Marcinkus, the Walter Jenkins/Bebe Rebozo &quot;bagman&quot; of the Vatican Bank, who was able to provide $250 million from the Vatican pension funds to reimburse the machinations of the Calvi/Banco Ambrosiano debacle.  Cornwell's in depth portrayals of Papa Luciani's two secretaries, Bishop John Magee and Don Diego Lorenzi and what they did when they found Luciani dead and unattended validates Garry Wills' &quot;Papal Lies&quot; thesis: functionaries in the Vatican lie from force of habit, rather than from malice or personal gain.<br />Yet there is malice afoot: &quot;[Cardinal/secretary of state Jean] Villot's miscalculation of [Luciani]'s administrative capacities, his poor state of health, was disasterous and surely culpable.&quot; Luciani insisted that &quot;he had usurped the papal chair he sat in. 'The Foreign Pope [John Paul II] is coming to take my place.' &quot; And Karol Wojtyla sat opposite Luciani in the Conclave that selected Luciani to follow Montini.<br />To tell more, would destroy the suspence of Cornwell's story, yet one can say that Luciani was not poisoned, despite centuries of papal murders, that Luciani did not committ suicide, although he certainly lost his will to live, and welcomed death.

Kirsch states that &quot;Compared to David, Bill Clinton is a choir boy.&quot;  Which is completely true, but Kirsch's story, which relies exclusively upon immediate Bible texts, put me to sleep night after night, until I finally finished. Basically, the book reads like an average seminary student doing a less than brillant term paper on the different aspects of David in Kings and Chronicles, without once encountering the drama of this mass murderer, adulterer, guerrella fighter and betrayer of father, son, loyal Uriah, etc.<br />    And even Kirsch's biblical exegesis is sorely lacking: example, Kirsch never explains why David's trusted counselor, Ahithopel, joins with Absalom in Absalom's revolt against Absalom's aged father, David.  Think what a decent graduate seminary student could have done by pointing out that Eliam, the father of Bathseba [Samuel 23:34] was the son of Ahithopel, and thus the grandfather of Bathseba.  &quot;As David's counselor in the palace, Ahithopel must have burned with rage to know that [David had raped Ahithopel's granddaughter, Bathseba] and killed Uriah, her husband, who was a fellow soldier with [Ahithopel's] son Eliam.&quot; {Jeffrey, &quot;The Signature of God,&quot; p. 244.}<br />    One is sad that the author of &quot;The Harlot by the Side of the Road&quot; was burned out when he chose to do a single volume on a single character, rather than a series of sharp, precise vignettes.  David needs much better than this.  Even the Gregory Peck Holy-wood treatment is superior to this insipid redaction ad infinitum.	2000-11-01

And the changes in health insurance practices means that COPD [chronic bronchitis and emphysema] patients must now fend for themselves in obtaining quality and quantity treatment.  And this book gives the tools to do just that.<br />&quot;COPD can be an exhausting and overwhelming burden to live with. Patients [and their caregivers] who continually fear running out of air, who watch their capacities dwindle prematurely, struggle with a heightened sense of their fragility.  They and those close to them are usually frightened, depressed and angry.  Doctors treating COPD patients do the best they know how to do.  The problem is that so many were taught only to treat the medical aspects of COPD--and many [doctors] have never learned since to appreciate the importance of rehabilitating their patients. . . . Restoration to a happier, healthier lifestyle should be the goal of any tratment program -- and it is certainly [the aim of this book] in educating you.&quot;<br />     This revised edition is the best there is for the trained, scholarly, and lay patient audiences: it is the terra firma when one is innundated with the contrary and steroid fueled anecdotal opinions one encounters in certain EST-like effort-less support groups on the Internet.<br />      This &quot;Chronic Bronchitis and Emphysema Handbook helps COPD patients and their families achieve the kind of realistic perspective about their disease that allows them to live confidently and reasonably calmly with it, and so remove needless limitations from their lives. . .&quot;<br />With this book, I learned to breathe easily and breathe well.AMDG	2000-10-23

Perhaps the extended appendix about &quot;La Poppessa,&quot; Sister Pasqualina Lehnert, &quot; the German born housekeeper, confidante, adviser, and closest aide [for 41 years] to . . .Pius XII,&quot; and chief source for Pius XII's cause for sainthood is one such impropriety.<br />Perhaps the short paragraph about Pius IX use of the death penalty as ruler of the Papal states creates a problem.  Perhaps the one page devoted to Opus Dei, the source of Dominus Iesus, caused some embarrassment. Unfortunately, the late author's description of the steps to sainthood is hopelessly out of date in the face of John Paul II's assembly line.  However, he does list those 40 non-existent saints whom Paul VI removed from veneration in 1969, such as Christopher, Valentine, Anastasia and Barbara.  Lo Bello notes that &quot;other saints are optional on the basis of local loyalties. For instance, Saint [Patricus] is fine in Ireland [and the United States], but according to a Vatican official, 'holds little interest for the Cambodians.' &quot;<br />Yes indeed, this is a humanizing book which tweaks those who would sanctify pontiffs and popes.  I have placed it on my shelf next to &quot;Rome Has Spoken&quot; and &quot;Papal Lies,&quot; right above &quot;The Bad Popes&quot; and &quot;Sex Lives of the Popes,&quot; and below Cardinal Ratzlinger's exegesis on the Catechism.  I suspect the publisher may run out of copies shortly. <br />&quot;The book, which could be read as portraying 'surprising and ridiculous' foibles of modern popes, 'truly is not good, nor true nor opportune,' [Cardinal] Gantin wrote in a letter published by the Italian magazine 30 Giomi.&quot;<br />&quot;I ask the pardon of all those who may have been surprised, scandalized or not edified by my  naive involvement in this affair,&quot; the Dean of the College of Cardinals wrote.<br />Definitely, a must buy and must read.

All that held the world wide sea level was a natural earthen dam now known as the Bosphorus.  Suddenly, 7600 years ago, the Aegean/Meditranean Sea burst this fragile dam, and huge volumes of water poured into the inland lake.  As much water poured through in a single day, as pours from the Great Lakes over Niagra in a year, and this continued for a year. Was this the Flood of Noah and Gilgamesh?

And just this summer, remains of human wooden habitat and tools were found on the pre-flood lakeshore of this fresh water lake.  Most convincing is the flow from the Mediteranean of salt water into the Bosphorus below a contrary flow of fresh water from the Black Sea out.  The authors trace the resulting diaspora via archeology, linguistics, et al, and show how the survivors spread their talents and languages North and South from this disaster. They convince the reader of the truths found beneath 4000 years of Biblical and Sumerian oral traditions.  A fascinating read as the authors make the most esoteric scientific findings easily ascertained without &quot;dumbing down.&quot;  Like the Jesus Seminar, the authors wade through the myths and assemble the truth.  Science does not displace faith, and faith is made a reassurence for scientific insight.	2000-10-18

In its particulars, this book belongs on the same shelf as Orson Welles 58-page objection to the studio's mangling of &quot;Touch of Evil.&quot;<br />I was fascinated with the insights of the artistic conflicts between the director and the author of the original book upon which the movie is based.  He devotes just the right amount of analysis to the legal fights surrounding the proper credits for Mercedes McCambridge, the 'voice' of the demon, and the stunt double for the possessed girl, including the famous exorcised 'spider' crawl. He does not allude to the portrayal of Teilhard de Chardin by Max von Syndow, but does justify his own insights concerning a homoerotic element not intended by either the author or the director, but present within this cinematic classic.<br />One need not have a personal belief in demonic possession, and the ability of priests to 'exorcise' multiple personalities, to truly enjoy both the movie, and Kermode's medical school Anatomy 301 dissection of one of the 100 best movies.  The Movie, this book, and the CD Soundtrack are five-star winners. AMDG	2000-09-15

Those who support this myth, and rank this book with less than 4  stars, will only grant that Catholic Dogma has been refined. Unfortunately,  many many doctrines have reversed themselves to remain au courant with  changing times, places and mores.<br />This is not a definitive exposition of  each and every changing dogma.  Instead, a collection of authors, each a  recognized expert in their field of competance, has chosen to give a Cliffs  Notes summary of the history and present value of various dogmas and  doctrines. In other words, this is a Guide to Papal Statments, and a  starting place for further research on particular questions. I was  particularly pleased to see Diana Hays summary of how the Church has  changed on Slavery, and Charles Curran's precis on Religous Freedom.   Richard McCormick's piece on Theological Dissent by itself would justify  this volume. Charles Davis on Divorce and Remarriage is outstanding from  this Advocate/Procurator's view.  And these are just a few.  There are some  articles which do not meet the rigourous standards of the others --  Reuther's five pages are less than insipid. <br />I was particularly happy to  find the condemnation of the Magna Charta, albeit the index is  absurd.<br />Obviously this book is designed for a one-semester undergraduate  course since each section has discussion questions for further inquiry.   Like Garry Wills &quot;Life of St. Augustine&quot; &quot;Rome Has  Spoken&quot; is an easy Idiot's Guide to Roman Catholic Dogma.  Garry Wills  &quot;Papal Sin&quot; provides a scholars precis on several of the lightly  touched chapters of this book.  Tad Szulc's timely &quot;To Kill A  Pope&quot; also enlightens one on the abuses of papal temporal power.<br />For  those who think dogma has not changed, consider that Jesus condemned  Divorce, whereas the modern Church only condemns remarriage after divorce  sans Tribunal approval.  Both Peter and Paul contravened Jesus, and said it  was okay to divorce a non-Catholic, and modern practice says that one may  not apply for a Declaration of Nullity until and unless one has first  obtained a Civil Divorce. Jesus forbade divorce, modern Rome forbids  remarriage.  Even St. Augustine divorced his common law wife, at his  mother's urging, so that he would be eligible  for a more socially  acceptable mating, and this was less than 500 years after Jesus forbade  divorce.  Yes, Roman Catholic practices and beliefs are eternal and  unchanging.  AMDG	2000-08-18

Wills uses a neo-Thomastic analysis to conclude that  self-deception has become an engrained daily operation in Rome from all  twentieth century popes to the lowest ranking Jesuit in the Vatican  archives.  Wills uses the tools of a historian to demonstrate that Vatican  pronouncements are deceitful, even when the deceit serves no purpose  whatsoever. One of the myths of Roman Catholicism is that Catholic  Tradition is a useful midrash to clarify ambiguities in the Scriptures.   Wills conclusively demonstrates the proclaimers of &quot;Tradition&quot;  have used tradition to obfuscate Scriptural clarities.  He shows how a less  than literate Pius IX proclaimed his godhead by saying that he, Papa No No,  was Tradition personified, especially in his pedophilic retention of  Edgardo Mortago, who had been kidnapped from his Jewish parents:  &quot;The  Pope . . . genuinely loved children.&quot;  Even John Paul II was unable to  tell the truth about the Catholic complicity with Hitler and Mussolini's in  the letter acknowledging the deceits of Catholic complicity with Catholic  Eichman's Final Solution.<br />Wills also takes a direct sight on the unholy  conspiracy of silence in the Catholic priesthood:  The pedophiles are  protected by the homosexual and straight celebate and non-celibate clergy,  lest the lay community learn that celebacy is a grace given to a monastic  few.  The heterosexual clergy refuse to out the pedophiles and homosexuals  lest the homosexuals and pedophiles out the non-celibate straights. Even  the celebates hesitate to condemn pedophiles lest the stain rebound on  those without the grace of celebacy, who are worthy clergy and bishops.  Thus we have acelebate gay Cardinal truthfully proclaiming his individual  celebate innocence, and thus succeeding in deflecting questions of how  pedophiles abused teenagers in his own Midwestern residence, without his  direct knowledge, due to his own willfull ignorance. How many sermons have  been preached in Northern California concerning a Santa Rosa Bishop  blackmailing a priest into sexual favors lest the priest's rigid adherence  to liturgical perfection be equated with simple theft?<br />Wills uses  neo-Thomistic tools to defend Augustine's attack on Jerome's mendacity, and  to suggest that the &quot;intent to deceive&quot; is what distinguishes a  Lie from Truth.  This completely eliminates the Bellarmine notion of  &quot;mental reservation&quot; and shoots large holes in the deceitful  principle of the double effect.  Thus viewed, each and every Roman  pronouncement can be evaluated on the test of &quot;Was the announcement  intended to deceive?&quot;  The words used or omitted are not the criteria.   Thus when Rome says that John Paul I died with a prayer book in his hands  when he was discovered by his male secretary, we know that deceit was  intended since he died with a financal report on the Vatican Bank, and his  corpse was discovered by a nun.  We need not look for the motive in this  deceit:  the fact that it was a lie and was intended to mislead is  sufficient.<br />There is a motto taken from John and inscribed on the outside  of the CIA Headquarters Building: &quot;Ye shall know the Truth, and the  Truth shall make you free.&quot;  There are no words to convince the  Vatican of this Augustinian self-evident natural law tenet, but so long as  we have conservative Catholics like Wills proclaiming what is true and what  is false, the Vatican may learn from example that Truth is the true healer  of ancient wrongs.  This book forms a useful exegesis to the earlier  &quot;Rome Has Spoken.&quot; Wills is more charitable than Tad Szulc's  &quot;To Kill the Pope&quot; regarding the hatred of the Cathars for the  post Vatican II Latin Rite of the Holy Roman Catholic Church.	2000-08-14

The book arrived on Monday; I finished it on Wednesday.  It is definitely a page turner of the first order. Does it answer the question of Why a  Turkish gangster member of a Fascist group called the Gray Wolves was  almost successful in assassinating Pope John Paul II in 1981?  Maybe, maybe  not. One is tantalized by the author's afterword, when Szulc states that  his plot is truth, albeit the protagonists are either fictional or  composites &quot;to protect his sources.&quot; Unfortunately, there is no  &quot;Freedom of Information Act&quot; to compel disclosure of his basic  source document, and the CIA copy of the Vatican's investigative report  would be unavailable as well. Does one need a scholar's knowledge of Roman  Catholic history to enjoy this book to the fullest?  Not at all, since  Szulc fills in the blanks with admirable succinctness, albeit he is  overwrought with the details of the the Roman violent suppression of the  Cathar heresy/schism: he repeats the dates/facts at least six times without  embellishment. Knowledge that it was the CIA that spread the disinformation  charging that the KGB used the Bulgarians to have a right wing Turk  assassinate the Pope is not mentioned. This by itself indicates that Szulc  was in debt to the CIA for the details of his plot. Since the CIA and the  FBI are both heavily loaded with conservative Catholics of the Opus Dei  cult, this leak to Szulc is unsurprising.  I could not rate it with five  stars, since the minor liet motif of a romance between a late vocation  Jesuit and a most attractive nun just doesn't work.  But perhaps, because  it is true, this romance is banal. This summer is truly the season of  fictional imaginings surrounding historical events of recent vintage.   Consider &quot;The Confirmation&quot; which is derived from the appointment  of Gates as head of the CIA, and of course, &quot;American Rhapsody&quot;  which surrounds the graffitti of Monica Gate with imagined pop psychology  stream of consciousness.  Szulc has not marred this ecclesiastical thriller  with such cheap imaginings.  His years as a reporter for the NY Times give  him a crisp, complete no nonsense style, which makes this  &quot;expose&quot; eminently readible.<br />If this is as accurate in broad  brush as Szulc claims, then one wonders about the reactions in Rome and  Southern France.  The timing of publication is exquisite: it obviously  triggered the release of the Third Secret of Fatima, despite Szulc's  omission of any mention of it.  One hopes that the paperback edition will  include annotations.  This review refers to the hardback version.	2000-08-11

It is most  interesting to see how he combines two or more real people into one  composite.  If one is reading this strictly for a John LeCarre or Ian  Fleming invention, then this book suffers.  If one is familar with a  sinister Clark Clifford, or his reincarnation Vernon Jordan --  &quot;American Rhapsody&quot; -- then one is more than rewarded.  I  particularly liked Powers composite of Oliver North and John Dean as an  idealistic CIA grunt.  One would not fault &quot;Search for Red  October&quot; because the ending is anticlimatic, and recognize that  publication of our antisub capability by the Naval Institute insurance  agent was a master stroke in the Cold War.  Similarly, the denoument in  this book is not a surprise, but like a jig saw puzzle, seeing how the  pieces fit is satisfying.  It is worth noting that many American aviator  POWS were sent to USSR during the Korean War, and once drained of useful  intelligence, were gulaged.  The circumstances of one Laos POW being  forgotten by the KGB/GRU/FSI are entirely credible.  After all, the United  States gulaged Nosenko on Bobby Kennedy's personal responsibility.<br />Some  complain about the anticlimatic ending.  Quite simply, Powers like Gresham  and other trial lawyers writing damn good novels, just does not know how to  end a book.  If one wishes a good ending, read Poe or Holmes. If one wants  a good page turner, with superb character delineation, then Powers' roman a  clef is my and your cup of amontilado.	2000-08-04

There is little remaining to be said about this book, and whether or not the case has been made concerning Pacelli's concern for Hebrews. ...  <br />There is another reason to read this book, it makes it clear that Pacelli drank deep of the aryan philosophy which made the African races less than human. In 1920, Pacelli attacked France for using African troops in the Rhineland. A US Congressional investigation debunked these charges completely. In the aftermath of WWII, Pius XII begged Eisenhower not to put African American troops in Rome, because of their race. Notwithstanding, Franco was supported in Spain, when he invaded the Republic with his Moors. African American troops defended Italy and Rome from Hitler's Catholic Austrian troops at Christmas 1944 at Sommocolonia Italy at a terrible price.<br />The Vatican Archives have been purged: the Jesuits in charge of Pius cause would place their fourth oath above historical accuracy.

One of the beauties of the game is that one can see a necessary piece, but one cannot remove it until other  pieces, which partially cover it, are removed. This book, like its  predecessor, shows its evil persona from the start, but uses many twists  and turns before the dramatis persona is fully exposed to the other  characters. I found it most interesting that Sen. McCarthy and Roy Cohn  were not portrayed, but a nice portrait of J.Edgar Hoover was crucial to  the denoument.  Degrading Cardinal Spellman to a mere Monsignor was also a  nice touch. The lead Congressman seems based on Parnel Thomas, of HUAC  fame.  There was an American diplomat who defected to the Czech Republic;  and the declassification of the Verona cables makes it clear that there  were GRU/NKVD couriers during the immediate post WWII era. This book raises  an interesting &quot;What If?&quot; Alger Hiss had fled when Whittaker  Chambers pulled the microfilm out of the pumpkin?  Again if one likes  Columbo and Tai Pei, this book will delight.  On the other hand, if one  likes the complete surprise of Murder She Wrote, or Sherlock Holmes, then  this is not for you.

Often one can see the vital piece, yet one has to match three or  four satellite pieces before one can match the partially hidden vital  piece.  If so, then this book is the one for you. The McCarthy era was one  I lived through, and this book gives the persona of the peripheal players  in the same half hidden mode.  It even seems to have input from the Verona  cable intercepts.  Like a good Sherlock Holmes or Edgar Alan Poe, the  players are only half hidden.  The fun is not in guessing which is whom,  the fun is in seeing the sweater unravel.  The portrait of Hoover is  fantastic. Disclaimer, one of the Cold War spies hidden in this book was a  Andrew Duggan.  He is not a relative to the best of my family's knowledge.  The book's use of a gay undersecretary of state's name for the  Congressional witch-hunter is delightful, since the former was under  suspicion by Hoover during this era, and McCarthy himself was gay.  I liked  Los Alamos very much also, since the factoids were never twisted.  Consider  also that Y2K problems affected our current intelligence gathering and  processing capabilities just when the Algerians were putting their plot in  action, or do you believe that the interception of the car at the Canadian  border was fortuitous?	2000-02-02

This delightful scholarly tome gives a partial answer: the industry wanted to have its product go to the largest possible  audience, despite local and national boards of censors.  By censoring  themselves, they obtained a pugnacious Irish Catholic who could browbeat  bishops, state legislators, and others.  The only price was to meet this  one person's private moral code:  to make movies that would not offend 12  year old girls in convent schools.  This history of the Production Code  Authority, and how it was exercised is par excellence.  What gave Breen his  power was a confluence of Catholic bankers, vertical integration from  studio through distributor to exhibitor, coupled with mandatory booking at  the exhibition level.  The weakness for the studios was Catholic threats of  boycotts at the midwestern exhibitor level where the studios were weakest.   This book should be coupled with the author's &quot;Catholic Crusade  Against the Movies&quot; and the pictoral &quot;Sin in Soft Focus.&quot;   An interesting footnote is the KKK response to the Roman Catholic Legion of  Decency.  Does the revival of Catholic horror of blasphemy, in the  so-called Catholic League of the 1990s pose a similar threat?  Probably  not, since the Fr. Lord's Legion of Decency was focused on Jewish studio  heads, and the Catholic League objects to Catholic movie makers and  Catholic television writers.  The PCA did more than condemn the use of  angora sweaters in the finished movies, it forbade any movie that was  social in comment or controversial in its politics.  Somehow it even  managed to offend William Randolph Hearst, a honor usually reserved to  Orson Wells and &quot;Rosebud.&quot;	1999-12-29

What triggered this piestic morality  run riot in the 20th Century?<br />This generous coffee table volume proves  that a single picture is worth a chapter of description. Two other  excellent scholarly studies provide lengthy verbal descriptions of the 100  movies which resulted in the Catholic Legion of Decency controlling the  total output of a billion dollar industry, until an amalgam of 1st  Amendment and antitrust court decisions showed that the Legion was in  reality a fake and a fraud.  This volume shows in photographic stills what  outraged the lay Catholic Grundy's.  As the lyrics of the musical  &quot;Chorus Line&quot; state it was &quot;tits and ass,&quot; male and  female.<br />The author's preface alone is worth the price of admission,  pointing out that the bagman of the Harding Election, Will Hays, a  Presbyterian elder and postmaster in the Harding Cabinet, succesfully  prevented additional state and federal censorship boards from being  established.  A facinating tidbit is that Hays bribed Father Lord with a  $500  stipend [1930 $$s], which infuriated Quigley, publisher of the  Exhibitor's Herald.<br />This book examines with a discerning microscope the  100 post code pre-Legion movies which caused the wholly Jewish industry to  produce films suitable for Catholic grade schoolers.  It is absolutely  mandatory to have this volume in hand when reading the two Black books  [&quot;Catholic Crusade&quot; (1998) and Hollywood Censored&quot; (1994)].   shows what the fuss and feathers was all about.<br />It is also noteworthy  that most Catholics, lay and clerical, considered &quot;miscegnation (sex  relations between the white and black races)&quot; [from both the Hays  &quot;Don'ts and Be Carefuls&quot; and the 1930 Production Code] to be  immoral and communistic. Father Lord, SJ, a racist right winger, agreed  totally with this premise, since like President Wilson, his initial  cinematic immersion was in &quot;Birth of A Nation.&quot;  It should be  remembered that in 1930-34, over 30 states made miscegnation a criminal  offense, and Lord's Code forbade the movies from depicting criminal  violations in a favorable manner. Most, but not all, Catholic bishops in  the United States, prohibited priests from witnessing marriages that were  forbidden by state and federal law.  Another interesting premise is that if  a social, moral, or economic delimna is not discussed, then it does not  exist.  In other words, if the movies do not discuss white slavery, or  divorce, or abortion, or miscegnation, then these problems cease to exist  for moral America.  Fortunately, then as now, the so-called moral majority  was neither.<br />I would have given my eyeteeth to have had this volume when  I was teaching &quot;Entertainment Law.&quot;ÿ	1999-12-14

I had not been given insights into the human behind the  theology.  Wills quickly dispelled my hostility by pointing out that the  famous &quot;Confessions&quot; are not an inventory of the Bishop of  Hippo's weaknesses, mistakes, and sins.  Instead Wills makes clear that the  &quot;Confessions&quot; are a Testimonial of this man's journey to know the  unknowable, a monologue addressed to an unresponsive Yahweh.<br />Wills makes  clear that despite the breast-beating of the &quot;Confessions&quot; and  the misogyny of the elder theologian, Augustine was no libertine, in fact  Wills makes clear that Augustine was a serial monogomist prior to being  baptized.  Wills also points out that Augustine was physically abused  during his childhood. {By coincidence, I read Alice Miller's &quot;Drama of  the Gifted Child&quot; in parrallel with this oh too brief Life.}  <br />In my  high school years, we used Classic Comics to avoid the lengthy readings  assigned us in Eng &amp; American Lit.  In college we used Cliff Notes and  &quot;trots&quot; to keep ahead of the Latin assignments.  All of our  that these abbreviations would stop us from viewing the total work.  In  that sense, some readers will regard this Life and the other Penuin Lives  with distaste.  To the contrary, Wills' short precise and cursory biography  has led me to the longer Brown tome, as well as to the text of Augustine's  writings with renewed interest.  I seek further understanding as to  Augustine's pagan stoicism regarding marital pleasure.  <br />Wills points out  that Augustine's mother was a Donatist, a Christian heresey marked by a  total lack of forgiveness.  This insight alone makes this slender volume  Augustine have only one unwanted child during fifteen years of a monogamous  relationship?  Did Augustine practice pagan methods of birth limitation  such as coitus interruptus and/or anal intercourse?  Wills offers no clear  or convincing explanation of Augusitine's repulsion towards sexual marital  pleasure, although Augustine's senior citizen writings which despise a  &quot;lack of control&quot; in marital pleasures, might indicate priapism  and/or premature ejaculations and/or nocturnal emissions.<br />This short  &quot;trot&quot; by Wills is a welcome first start.

A Catholic anti-semite, Joseph Breen, and a Catholic extorionist, Martin Quigley, combined forces with a racist St. Louis Jesuit, Rev. Daniel Lord,SJ, to control the entire United States Movie Industry from 1934 until  1954, via boycotts, ignorant prelate pronouncements, and studio cowardice.   Gregory Black details the whole sordid story with archival evidence.  Curiously, Black does not highlight the startling evidence that Lord had  used the racial theories of the 1920s as a weapon against the Jewish  producers of motion pictures.  He also downplays the antitrust suits which  abolished the vertical integration -- ownership of exhibitors by the  studios-- and block booking --requiring the captive exhibitors to take all  of the films that a studio produced -- that enabled the movie producers to  become victims of a Catholic pressure group, the Legion of Decency. Fr.  Lord created a code of conduct for the studios which would protect the  &quot;moral ideals of the race.&quot;  The word &quot;race&quot; which was  code for white supremacy in 1930, was used over and over in the  Lord-Quigley Proposal for a Motion Picture Code. The code as adopted,  reflected American Catholic marriage practices which prohibited  miscegnation. The Legion of Decency labeled the mixing of races as part of  the Communist conspiracy, in accord with the personal views of Cardinals  McIntyre and Spellman; Spellman, like Sen. McCarthy, a closet homosexual.   Quite simply the Catholic orgranization agreed to boycott any picture that  did not have a Motion Picture Seal and any theatre that dared to show a  picture that was &quot;Condemned&quot;. The Production Administration  agreed to not issue a seal if the Legion objected.  Both entities condemned  and prohibited foreign and independent productions which threatened the  economic dominance of the six major Hollywood studios.  Most grotesque was  the banning by the Legion of a biography of Martin Luther because Luther's  theology was morally unacceptable.  Black does not emphasize the American  Chruch's misleading pastoral parish level teaching during this period that  civil divorce was forbidden. The correct teaching is that remarriage after  a civil divorce was and is forbidden.  Any picture which  &quot;condoned&quot; divorce or miscegnation was malum  prohibitum. One  enjoys accurate non-polemic social history, and this volume is definitely a  must for movie buffs, American Catholic History buffs, and for those  political scientists interested in unchecked power.  One also notes that  during this period, Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Soviet Russia, all  employed massive censorship to protect the masses from degenerate  entertainment.  The Legion of Decency was not a unique phenomenon in  forbidding any depiction of homosexuality and other  &quot;depravities.&quot; &quot;[T]he history of filmmaking in Hollywood  during the era of censorship []is not a matter of how a few filmmakers got  away with something, but that thousands upon thousands of films were  refashioned to fit into the [lay Catholic] worldview of the censors. .  .What the [censors] did not want, and successfully squelched, was the overt  visualization and discussion of controversial issues. . .For more than  three decades the Hollywood film industry allowed religious clerics to  determine what was moral and immoral, what was socially acceptable  political comment and what was not.&quot;  This was achieved through the  &quot;Production Code Administration [Breen]and its alter ego, the Catholic  Legion of Decency [Quigley].  This reviewer horrified his fiance in 1955,  when he sat when the &quot;voluntary&quot; pledge was offered in her parish  church. &quot;Was this man going to be the father of [her] children?&quot;  (The reviewer was responsible for 12 pregnancies and seven chilren and 23  years of Catholic sacramental marriage, despite being corrupted by viewing  &quot;The Moon is Blue.&quot;)	1999-11-30

The solid scientific evidence concerning the growth of Christianity from less than 1000 in 40 CE to only 40,000 in 150  CE and exploding to 33 million only 200 years later is breathtaking.  And  unlike other secular sociologists who squirm at the mere mention of the  supernatural, Stark is willing to use &quot;faith&quot; as an important  factor:  Christian dogmas against abortion and girl-baby infantcide, and in  favor of helping one's neighbor, all contributed to a mammoth population  explosion within the Christian support groups.  Unlike Gibbons, Stark is  neither a historian nor a theologian nor a Bible scholar, he is a  sociologist who gives the evidence, and lets all of facts fall where they  may, including the &quot;I don't knows.&quot;  Stark does for early  Christianity what Andrew Greeley is doing for millenium Catholicism.  If  you admire Greeley, and I do, you will love and respect Stark.  And vice  versa. Both show us that emperors have no clothes and beautiful rich  vestments, if we will only let Stark and Greeley show us the facts.	1999-10-13

Yet the remaining 100 pages seem more of a rehash of birth order determinants set in a biblical melieu: the  responsible child (#1=Pharisee); the rebel child (#2=Samaritan); the lost  child (the Essene); and the comedian/clown/distractor (the Sadducee).  Each  of these vignettes is portrayed in an open and instructive manner, yet the  nexus between spiritual addiction (1st 48 pages) and this child-order  hypothesis seems lacking.   The chapters on Scripture &amp; Spiritual  Abuse, and What Would Jesus Do, seem to offer diagnosis without treatment.   Notwithstanding, this book can be recommended.  The notion of Spiritual  Addiction, particularly by those called to the clerical life, is present in  this book, and if we are content that this is a valid first cut at a  significant problem, then the recommendation stands.  Much more needs to be  done on and with this topic.  The authors' seminal book --&quot;Good Goats:  Healing Our Image of God&quot;  attacks the problem of spiritual addiction  much better.  &quot;Good Goats&quot; offers diagnosis and treatment of the  root factors in spiritual addiction.(5 stars).	1999-10-06

Just like VP Gore claims to have invented the Internet when he couldn't tell a computer utility (my book: 1972) from the  Arpanet.<br />This hard-to-find tome sets the record straight: At most Clinton  is the 7th or 8th African American President.<br />Although Tom Jefferson's  paternity via Sally Hennings of Black descendents has been established via  DNA, this book points out that Jefferson's father was half-black and half  Indian (?).  It also notes that George Washington was a literal father of  his country, having impregnated one of his beatiful African slaves. Next in  line, in accord with the American notion that any significant African blood  = Black, is Andrew Jackson, whose natural father was an African slave,  since his namesake parent had died before Andy was conceived. Abe Lincoln  and Warren Harding have long been rumored to have African ancestry.  The  author presents a strong case for claiming Dwight Eisenhower as African.   Whilst the case is not convincing, there is credible evidence that Cal  Coolidge of New England Indian ancestry makes this honor list.  Her last  chapter of this 1993 book more than hints that our current president is  African American, possibly the 7th or 8th {if one includes silent Cal).   One also notes that the Jan. 1999 printing was the 9th printing, so there  are lots of people using this valuable text.  The excellent bibliography  makes this a most valuable reference.  One hopes for many many reprints in  the years to come.	1999-09-28

It is  somewhat like reading a movie or play script instead of witnessing the  performance.

The author was ordained in 1994, and this book was published in 1996.  It  bears the Imprimatur of Fabian Bruskewitz, who had been bishop of Lincoln,  Nebr., less than a year before this ms. went to the publisher.  Apparently,  the author completed this volume whilst assistant chaplain at the Univ.of  Nebr. during that Diocese's upheaval under Bruskewitz, a worthy successor  to the Popes whom Panzer cites with approval, Alexander VI, recently  honored by the Vatican with a postal commemerative, and Julius III.  Alexander VI was the illegitimate son of Pope Callistus III.  Alexander VI  had four children, and had a relationship with his daughter, Lucrezia  Borgia.  Alexander gave the New World to Spain, and Brazil to Portugal.  Both countries then declared that Indians could be conquered and enslaved  because they would not peacably embrace Christianity.  Paul III &quot;gave  his sister Giulis 'to Alexander VI to be deflowered'.&quot;  He also  &quot;committed incest with his daughter Constancia and poisoned her  husband Bosius Sforza that he might the more freely enjoy her;&quot;.  Paul  excommunicated Henry VIII and forbade Catholic services to be said in  England.  Paul III issued a pontifical decree, &quot;The Sublime God&quot;  which &quot;played an exalted role in the cause of social justice in the  New World.&quot;  Such are the authorities cited in this slender volume.  Panzer's basic premise is that the Popes did condemn North and South  American slavery, which was different from &quot;just title  servitude.&quot;  The latter is justified today, whereas the former was  something entirely different.  He maintains that the Latin word  &quot;servitus&quot; which is used in papal documents, can mean either  slavery American-style or &quot;just title servitude.&quot;  Humpty Dumpty  would be proud of Panzer's redaction on &quot;servitus.&quot;  However,  this 124 page volume is worthy of its price of admission, since it is the  only collection of Papal documents in Latin and English which tendiciously  deal with the &quot;peculiar institution,&quot; but one should be extra  careful in relying on the English, particularly in view of the Vatican's  insistence that Americans, Canadians, and inhabitants of the British Isles,  lack the erudition in English of Tasmanian bishops.  {The latter corrected  the former's rendition of the English version of the Catechism.)

In short, one cannot  recommend that any university or public library acquire it for its  collection. However, it is possible that ignorant judges rendering ignorant  decisions might cite this monograph as &quot;expert&quot; opinion.  The  foreward states that: &quot;the power of clear statement is the ultimate  gift of the great teacher.&quot;  Galler falls far short of meeeting that  criterion.      In reviewing this work, one must start with the premise  that Intellectual Property [IP], like artifical intelligence, is an  oxymoron.  In legal and economic terms, property is a tangible that can be  possessed by only one person at one moment in time.  In other words,  Property represents a zero-sum game:  If I possess it, then you don't.  IP  on the other hand can be possessed by the many without diminuation to any  other would-be possessor.  A user of WINDOWS 2000, the illegitimate  descendent of DOS 4.0 and TOPVIEW, does not interfere with any other user  of WIN. Thus IP is a collection of legal aplets which are used to create  scarcity and exclusivity for their putative owners.  The protection concept  subsumed by IP does not &quot;protect&quot; the customer from anything.   The protection furnished by IP to the putative owners is evanescent, e.g.  IP, at best, is a hunting license for future lawsuits by a deep pocket  litigant.      One is tempted to tell Galler how he should have written the  book, since the overall format is promising if competantly developed.  The  notion of comparing copyright, patent, and trade secret objects within a  small universe of 32 court decisions merits instant approval.  The  individual chapter headings on substantial similarities, reverse  engineering, the mergerdefense, &quot;look and feel&quot;, and the  doctrine of &quot;equivilancies&quot; under patent law, all merit  thoughtful and insightful treatment by someone who is at home with legal  constructs and technological palaver.  A book that defines technological  terms for the legal persona and legal constructs for the technological  would be valuable.  Galler himself is confused by his own constructs of  &quot;textual&quot;, &quot;behavioral&quot;, &quot;static&quot;, and  &quot;dynamic&quot; structures and this reviewer remains confused by  Galler's exegesis on technological metaphors and legal metaphors.       There is no discussion in this book of the Economic issues of IP.  One  looks in vain for any mention of antitrust, venture financing, royalties,  license fees, blanket licensing agreements, and other profit &amp; loss  issues.  Galler does not deal with the legal/economic tensions inherent in  using multiple IP constructs:  adhesion contracts + hardware patents +  copyright + trade secret, which erect a razor wire fence around IP  technology.  One also notes that it is rare in our present technology for  the human creator of IP to be the legal owner thereof.      Galler's  chapters seem to hint at an historical imperative that is quite Hegelian in  its implications:  if a company wins an IP lawsuit, then that company's IP  products and services will not survive.  If Apple had lost its lawsuit to  remove the garbage can from GEM's TOPVIEW, then the Apple OS might be the  industry standard instead of the DOS 7.0 /WIN 95 /&quot;BOB&quot; OS.  Microsoft lost its IP lawsuit with IBM over OS2, and WIN95 is a de facto  standard.  IBM lost its IP battle with Phoenix over BIOS, and Phoenix is  now the de facto standard. IBM won its battle with Antitrust, and is now a  nonentity on the desktop with overpriced mediocre hardware that relies on  WIN98 rather than OS/2 3.0 [aka WIN NT and/or WINDOWS 2000].  Microsoft's  victory over the Justice Dept. on the bundling of OSfor OEMs appears  Pyrrhic in nature, even though BOB didn't make it from a wedding present to  a viable interface.	1999-09-09

He offers convincing evidence that 50% of the Latin Rite Priests and Bishops are sexually active, despite  the Church's teaching that any and all sexual activity outside of marriage  is mortally sinful.  Anyone who has been affected by a sexually active  priest or bishop needs to read this book to learn that they are not alone.   Sipe's careful research is not an attack on celibacy:  instead he  reinforces the correct theological opinion that celibacy is a divine gift;  not a command that must be followed at all times and in all circumstances.   Unfortunately, the blurbs on the dust jacket of this book would lead one to  conclude that this is a &quot;Maria Monk&quot; exposing lurid secret  details of the priesthood for the prurient. Instead it is patient and kind  to those seeking an understanding as to why a bishop would publicly defend  his homoerotic liason with an embezzeling priest, as a &quot;consensual  arrangement between adults!&quot;  (Santa Rosa, 8/99)  One would hope that  either or both of his books would be mandatory reading for those enrolled  in Latin Rite seminaries, as well as their mentors.  This book deserves as  much seminary attention as that presently given to penitentials. Sipe notes  the failure of the Rite of Reconcilliation (Confession) for troubled  priests and their victims.  Perhaps this is because the Confessional as  practiced today is inherently Manichean:  it separates the sinful acts from  the human creature's entire being.  Many current 12th Step programs remedy  this defect of ordinary practice, by requiring complete inventories, assets  as well as liabilities.  These programs also stress the necessity of being  honest with oneself, and every anecdote related by Sipe can be condensed  into the simple question:  was the person able to be honest with themself?   As Polonius, the worst hypocrite in Shakespeare, advisedhis son [&quot;Do  as I say, not as I've done!}: &quot;To Thine Own Self Be True, and You  Canst Not Be False to Any One.&quot;  The successful celebates, who are  true saints, are the ones that have chosen celibacy and integrated it into  their whole being.  Like rare perfect blue white diamonds, the true  celebates remind us that human perfection is possible.  But we must also  remember that there is no sin in being less than perfect.  Sin is turning  away from God, and making self-deceit worthy of worship.  True stupidity is  deliberate ignorance, and Sipe's book counsels that the  &quot;Truth will  make us free.&quot;	1999-08-23

Most of the practicioners of 12 Steps confuse amends -- repairing an injury -- with seeking forgiveness from the injured party --  &quot;I've said I'm sorry, and now you have to forgive me!&quot;  The  literature surrounding these  12 Step programs also tends to make the  transgressor the injured party, by having the victim concentrate on what  was his or her contribution to the injury, and then requiring the injured  party to seek forgiveness from the transgressor, ignoring the injuries  caused by the injuring party.<br />Safer cuts through this nonsense with a  scapel, and reassures the injured parties that it may be necessary to  withhold forgiveness in order for the intimate betrayal to heal.  She  skewers those who would offer &quot;helpful advice&quot; which consists of  &quot;forgive and forget&quot; and its lemma, &quot;Get on with your  life.&quot;<br />Unfortunately, she relies upon a retrograde Catholic Priest,  a former Lutheran minister, Richard Neuhaus, who gives his own warped  interpretation of what the Christian doctrine of forgiveness is all about.   Neuhaus says that anything less than absolute forgiveness is worthy of  damnation.  He has yet to forgive any of those who critique his own rigid  theological inerrancies.  Neuhaus states &quot;It is morally imperative to  forgive in all circumstances.&quot;  Res ipsa loquitur.<br />Fortuunately, she  is able to demolish this demonical straw boss of a Neuhaus, and the  remainder of the book sings with joy, hope and freedom.  True forgiveness  looks at the betrayal, candidly weighs what is necessary to make the  injured party whole, and acts accordingly.  False forgiveness, doubles the  injury without the necessary healing.   Advising an other to forgive in  order to relieve one's own conscience is the true evil, and for this  Neuhaus is justly condemned.   If I have not been injured, then how can I  order an other to forgive?  Total and unconditional forgiveness of an  intimate betrayal does not come easy.  When it is possible, the rewards are  plentiful.  Been there, done that!  But a forgiveness that is incomplete  beats hatred of self, and revenge towards others.  And few have the  fortitude of Job.  And those of us that are yet unable to completely,  totally, and without reservation, forgive the betrayer, may not be saints,  but we are not the sinner who betrayed us. <br />Safer's life journey is not  complete, yet she offers us a ride as she moves to a better place.	1999-08-23

This roman a' clef, serves a valuable purpose in making Opus Dei finances available for easy comprehension.  It is a worthy  companion to Hutchison's monumental reference opus (pun intended):  &quot;Their Kingdom Come,&quot; and is even more timely. E.g. The NY Times  on August 3,1999,  reported that grains found imbedded on the Shroud of  Turin indicate that the Shroud is much older than its carbon dating  suggested.  This  1997 book gave the same imbedded grains hypothesis, and  provides an interesting alternative theory:  The Shroud of Turin was an  exact copy of the authentic Shroud, which has subsequently disappeared.    Using this book as a guide, one could hypothesize that the alleged  homosexual murder suicide of a Vatican guard and his commander, might be a  double murder to forestall publicity about the relationship of the two men.   An Italian journalist was preparing a detailed expose at the time of the  two men's death.   The Calvi, Sidonna, and Calvi's secretary's  &quot;suicides&quot; make this &quot;fiction&quot; a most interesting tour  de force. Recent events in the Diocese of Santa Rosa, Calif., make this  &quot;novel&quot; even more compelling.	1999-08-03

This book was originally published by Doubleday in England, and the  American Doubleday refused to touch it with a 10 foot pole.  Doubleday US  had made a bundle by selling a cheap edition of the outdated Catholic  Catechism which undercut almost every other publisher of the Catechism.   The publication of the original Catechism was the subject of an Antitrust  inquiry concerning price-fixing, and forced bundling of hard and paperback  editions.  (Price fixing and tie-ins are per se criminal violations of the  Sherman Act, Sec. 1)<br />The list of present members of this Masonic P(5)  structure, pp. 432-4, include such persons as Cormac Burke of the Tribunal.   Burke was a financial front man for University Hostels.   One should note  that the cross-fertilization between Freemasonry and Opus Dei is just  hinted at in this book.  At one time over &quot;121 senior prelates were  Freemasons.&quot;  This included &quot;cardinals Villot, Poletti, and  Baggio.&quot;  Villot is the person who disposed of the papers found in  John Paul I's hands when he died.

Unlike the vicious diatribes of Vasoli and Kennedy who seek to wreck  demonical vengance upon their nullity seeking spouses, this guide uses the  examples of the Samaritan woman and the Chicago &quot;marriage in  possession&quot; practices to guide the &quot;internal forum&quot;  solution.  Thus, in good conscience, a divorced and remarried Catholic can  receive Communion, be a Lector and Eucharistic Minister, even when the  Tribunal has said that the evidence for the &quot;external forum&quot;  is  insufficient.    A must read for remarried Catholics, their pastors, and  their bishops.   AMDG	1999-04-12

Those of us who have been blessed with ten or more years of  sobriety and serenity know that the AA founders were truly mortal, and  stumbled their way to a vital way of preserving abstinence despite  organizational imperitives.  This book gives the common sense, and humble  approach that Bill Wilson used to give guidance to the 12 Step Approach.   It is a welcome antidote to those Bleeding Deacons within and without AA  who seek to fossilize a vibrant, growing, and everchanging force with ever  increasing rigid restrictions and rules concerning AA membership.  This  volume ranks with Not-God, Secret History of Alchoholism, Slaying the  Dragon, and Natural History of Alcoholism as must-haves for those of us who  find AA a part of our daily lives, and not all of our lives.  It is  definitely terra incognita for those who have chosen AA as their only life,  and for those who abjure Rule 62:  &quot;Don't take yourself too  seriously!&quot;	1999-04-12
