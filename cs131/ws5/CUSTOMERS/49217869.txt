Not only did her hardcover book, &quot;Book of Fours,&quot; provide fans with one of teh Slayer's best stories, it fit logically into the Buffy-verse without taking many great leaps.<br />I'm not sure why she stopped writing with Christopehr Golden but I have no complaints. She blew his &quot;Tales of the Lost Slayer&quot; out of the water with this trilogy. It all fit neatly into the recent story lines of both Buffy and Angel (Seasons 4 / 2 respectively). <br />Kudos!

The story is a narrative told by Chris (Kit) Metcalfe from two of his points of view. The first is NOW, as he is a gay man approaching middle age, and THEN, remembering his days at a Brittish prep school and his first love, Stephen Walker.<br />Let me say this, while at first I hated the narrator, I grew to love and understand him. This is a story of a broken heart and the damage first love, here gay, wrecks on the heart and the mind. Stephen uses Chris, and isn't until 30 years later that Chris learns the truth of the relationship, and see the other man who may be his true love.<br />There are many twists that will make you stand up and cheer. This is about a journey that many gay men are on, and how we often hide our feelings from ourselves, even though they may be obvious to those closest to us.	2001-07-13

With The Wild Man, Warren again gets into the heads of gay men ever with a tale of love, desire, and the longing we all share to find the love of our life and make it work.<br />The title stems from the love interest, the story is told form the point of view of the central character, a bull fighter in Spain in the 1960s. <br />What makes this story so special is that Warren started it in the 1960s when she lived in Spain. It is only now that she felt she was ready to fully tell the story. <br />It reads like a piece of finely researched biography, travelling through almost four decades of growth, pain, love and harmony!<br />This is a must read for any one who loves gay fiction!	2001-07-13

I go back and forth on that judgement, mainly because his last book, Book of Lies, was so awful! It read like a tossed out script from some Aaron Spelling melodrama!<br />But with Onyx, you will find Picano in truly great form. The novel is crisp story telling that gets to th heart of its characters. Of love about to be lost (yes, AIDS) and the journey to go on with one's life in the face of adversity. <br />There are many surprise turns hear that one will read and find yourself screaming in shock. They all work. There is nothing that is contrived about this story. <br />While some of the &quot;love&quot; scenes may be something you feel you have resd before, the novel goes further to get to the heart of its characters. It doesn't just give you names to remember, but people to identify with and love or cherish them as you see fit.	2001-07-13

Odd right? Well, the story has finally kicked in and I am completely  absorbed in it.<br />The reason I am writing this review now is because I feel  this book is a must for anyone like me who is a lover of gay fiction. This  was penned in the early 1930s and apparantly had been lost for some time.  The author even published it under another name.<br />The thing about it is  that so far, and I am guessing he wont, the narrator of the story has not  said &quot;I'M GAY.&quot; Okay, I sound like an activist but I guess that  is what I find so fascinating about the book. <br />The narrator is learning  and discovering his homosexuality from a young boy to becoming a young man.  This is his journey for love and a place in the owrld, Ican relate.<br />But  what I find so intriguing is that he can never say &quot;I'm Gay.&quot; it  is always described as feelings about another man. He even uses the classic  phrase &quot;the love that shall not speak its name.&quot;<br />This is  definitely a book of its time. No writer writes like this anymore and th  characters speech is so over the top it is frightening at times.<br />However,  this is one of the first books written about gay love and the search for  acceptance. Without it, authors like Jim Grimsley, Patrica Nell Warren and  more could never have had the success they now enjoy so deservedly.<br />Pick  it up, you will be glad you did!	2000-09-13

Personally, I don't like that stuff, if I'm reading, exercise my mind, not  my loins.<br />Anyway, Guerra's debut is beautiful story about a young man,  unhappy with how his life turned out and the changes he makes to correct  his situation. There is a beauty and emotion to this book that is missing  from a lot gay fiction.<br />Guerra's book, while not brilliant, is very  passionate and emotional.

His debut novel is actually very  impressive. At the center of the story is Steven, a young man growing up  gay in New Orleans. The book adeptly traces his life from young grade  school boy to young college man. <br />I was very impressed with how Rice  combined six (or was it more) sub stories in this novel and then  masterfully tied together all the elements. It made me realize how  interconnected every one actually is. <br />But it is this element that I  loved that I actually disliked as well. There was too much going on, and it  isn't until (in my opinion) half way through the book that things start to  kick in and get going. Too much set up, not enough meat...(gee, sounds like  some of the men I have dated).<br />All the key players were involved with  Steven in one form or another, friends - family - school buds - neighbors  what have you. Rice was brilliant at the end at pulling it all together,  and I wont reveal the ending (disturbing as it was) because I do consider  it a must read and would hate to spoil it.<br />Pick up the book and judge for  yourself....	2000-09-13

I was 27 when I first read The Front Runner, it was published when I was only 5 years old. Even though it is a story about life  set in the 70s, it is a truly remarkable tale about love, destiny, passion  and the search for that special love we all seek. Harlan, the track coach  at the center of the book, has paid some tough prices for coming out as a  gay man. He lost a wife, a family, and yes it would be easy to say he  should never have gotten married and cheating on his wife...through Ms.  Warren's words, we see the pain and confusion that his sexual identity has  caused him. It is not until he is into his 40s that he finds he can be out  and lead a life deserving in respect &amp; love. The tragic ending will  move any heart I'm sure, gay or staright or questioning. Along with its  sequels, each just as brilliant, TFR is a landmark book that is a  celebration of the gay &amp; lesbian community.	2000-07-11

Harris smoothly and deftly moves the narration between his main characters Raymond &amp; Nicole. I was taken back a bit that the book alters the narration between the two charcters. It was amusing to see  how each one spoke of a certain situation, but expressed subtle differences  in how things played out. As a sequel, in my opinion, it surpasses its  predecessor, Invisible Life. I was blown away by how much the characters  had grown and changed. I was also completely engrossed in how they looked  at certain situations and what the implications on their lives had been.  Kudos to Mr Harris for being such a masterful story teller.	2000-07-11

I have been with women, and an attractive woman does still make me turn my head. But in my heart and soul I know I am gay, and it is the love of a man that I  desire. It leads me to believe that sexuality is not fluid or black &amp;  white. Thats is why I loved this book so much. The love the two men share,  and the distraction of a young girl to one is so mesmerizing to me, that I  completely understood the emotions the man was feeling. Its a beautiful  story, and yes, somewhat of an easy read. But there is an underlying tehme  of the choices we do make as gay men and how we perceive our desires, our  hopes and dreams.

It is no longer the 70s, but the 90s, and it seems the child Harlan tried to conceive with his lost husband, Billy,  is growing up and maturing  and ---coming out of the closet. The novel switches from narration by  Harlan to his son, William Heden. What was wonderful was to see the man we  love, Harlan, through the eyes of the boy. We have spent over 20 years with  just Harlan's point of view. I simply loved this book to all ends! It  reminded me of the feelings I had as a young boy when i was struggling to  come out and deal with my feelings. In my opinion, it surpases the second  book, Harlan's Race, because it doesn't have a forced / contrived feeling  to it. These are grounded characters who we have grown to love.

Patricia Nell Warren hooked me with The Front Runner series of  books. And when I read this book, there were many times I found myself  smiling and laughing. Set in the 70s, the book does read like a comical  version of Anita Bryant's (I hope I have that name right) campaign to  extinguish gay rights bills. But this book, takes that true life event, and  plugs the readers in deeper to the state of minds of its principal  characters. It is touching, humorous, and passionate.

Needless to say, I was hooked, and read everything of hers I  could find. Now, a few years later, I was introduced to E. Lynn Harris. All  I can say is OH MY GOD!

I  was only a little disappointed by a secondary plot involving a man from  Harlan's past as boy who has a hideous back story to him. In some ways, it  hurt my memory of the original novel a bit, and gave this book a  &quot;Hollywood&quot; type story line that I didn't really appreciate.

What truly makes him happy, how he feels, and how he  truly wants to be.<br />The story is moving, and for those gay men living in  Boston or have lived there, the setting is going to seem aty once familiar  and pleasant. <br />I applaud Mann for his book.
