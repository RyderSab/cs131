But his characters are all \\"types.\\"  Once you meet them on the opening pages, that is all you need to know. The strong-and-silent loner (lifted right off of an Elmore Leonard novel) and the cute-but-scrappy engenue (also a Leonard staple) and the jerk husband. None of them ever change. You never see anything redeemable in the husband, you never see the pettiness or selfishness that would render the hero a multiple-divorcee, or the wife such a loner. You just have to accept them, like TV-characters, to whom I think this book must be addressed. Cardboard cutouts. <br /> <br />The only interesting character is the lummox, \\"Earl\\" or \\"Tool\\" - in whom we see glimmerings of affection and care. <br /> <br />	2005-08-26

One sniffs the self-loathing of the academic elite who somehow finds it enlightened to find fault with his own culture. The self-agrandizing subtext being that HE is immune from these trappings.  <br /> <br />As with the first novel, we find people killed by snakes (or eels), and a celebration of the freedom of the kah toey transexual life. It seems that Burdett had only one set of ideas, but took two novels to tell them in.  If you've read the first, you've read the second. However, if you like the characters, you will enjoy them again here.	2005-07-31

Great story, a real page-turner - or for this audio version, a real tape-changer. Crichton takes the standard thriller conventions and turns them on their head. Or perhaps holds up a mirror. Seems like every book and movie of the past 10 years has used the device of the \\"greedy capitalist\\" who runs roughshod in pursuit of power and wealth. We accept this, for we know our own hearts and that of all men.  We hold that all men are not only capable of greed, but driven by it. Except for \\"activists\\" whom we assume are noble, and motivated by helping the plight of the downtrodden or \\"the planet.\\"   <br /> <br />Why is this? We could just as easily say that an oil tycoon grew up wanting to warm hospitals and light buildings and make energy available for children to read at night.  Crichton doesn't suggest this, but does show that an \\"environmentalist\\" will shade the truth if it means a $10 million dollar grant.  And that the vapid TV reporters will mouth anything they are given if it keeps the stupified viewers tuned in. And that the UN is laced with corruption.  And that 90% of what you think you know about \\"global warming\\" is bunk. <br /> <br />Funny: the reader, George Wilson, obviously did this without any preparation. He changes the pronunciation of characters in mid-sentence. The scientist Sanjong is pronounced \\"san-jong\\" and then \\"san-jang\\" and then \\"song-jong\\" within a single paragraph. It's one of the things that makes audio-books entertaining - hearing the pages rustling in the studio, mispronounced words, the wrong accent used for the characters. <br /> <br />A fun book, and hopefully will add to a correction of our misguided fears of environmental catastrophe.	2005-03-31

I use the word \\"inspiring\\" in the old fashioned sense of \\"it made me take action\\" not merely \\"it made me feel good.\\" <br /> <br />I re-read this book every year or so, not only to dip into the wonderful appendix of recommended books, but to rekindle my courage and dedication to raising my sons. O'Brien writes in mythic tones as he recommends mythic literature. The old stories dealt with \\"powers and principalities\\" of good and evil, and O'Brien reminds us that it is ever so. Our children become flush-faced and wide-eyed at such stories, but we have allowed ourselves to be diluted and deluded into thinking that gray is the only reality. We lose not only black and white, but the primary colors as well! <br /> <br />O'Brien is a Catholic, a Christian - and is both unapologetic and unobtrusive with his convictions. That is, he makes clear the traditional rationale for his thinking, but the reader neither has to agree nor adopt those convictions to come to the same conclusions.  <br /> <br />There are some books which one revisits again and again, and some authors you look forward to meeting and talking with. This book (and his Sojourners novels) and this author are in that category. <br /> <br />	2004-09-08

A couple of selfish and self-indulgent losers get their kicks throwing rocks through the windows of homes.

I agree with the reviewers who say that this is an engaging and fun-filled ride through history, as seen through the eyes of those who lived it.<br />What I wish to add, and warn about is the uneven quality of the writing. The writer wanders off the road quite frequently in his dialog. Soldiers as well as nobles will speak in near-Dickensonian phrases: long windy sentences, nuancing their terms and using euphemisms and poetic expressions. Then, without warning, the speaker will use gutter terms, and the conversation will linger on matters scatological or sexual. There is no thought for the consistency of the characters' nature, or previous style and manner of speaker. Nor to the reader's sensibilities.<br />One gets the strong impression of the author showing off his own \\"enlightened\\" freedom with such matters. He can neither argue that this is the way people spoke - for the characters are wildly inconsistent - nor that he is rendering their conversations as we would hear them today. But that is not true, either, for those who speak so crudely today are not prone to switching gears and saying \\"...his carriage does comport to offer such illusions to the sympathetic eye..\\" in the next breath.<br />The other possibility is that he is a good reader of history, but a poor writer. He takes his eye off the road, and drives into a ditch every few pages.  His use of anachronisms - figures of speech using inventions and habits not yet invented in ancient times - is further evidence of this.	2004-05-13

I took it home and began to look through it - I see such &quot;How to raise kids&quot; books frequently, as you can imagine. Most of it was good, solid, practical advice. Most parenting books are reminders of what we tend to forget in the hustle and bustle of daily life. That's a compliment, not a criticism. We physicians welcome any counsel to parents to relax about their little darlings, not fret about their child being slower or faster than another in their development, wondering if each challenge is evidence of some dire malady or another.<br />What I really liked about the book is the refreshing reminders about the nature of boys. Their physicality, their noise-level, their energy, their love of competition, weapons made from bread or play-dough, their dirty pants and laughter at funny sounds. That \\"the experts\\" believe that these are socialized or learned behaviors, and that \\"boys and girls are the same\\" has been a terrible disservice to our nation's little guys - and their parents.<br />Along with this calming counsel are chapters on the responsibility that comes with being a male. Finally, I dare to hope, boys may start to be raised to be men!  <br />Hats off to the good doctor - I returned my patient's book and bought several copies for myself and colleagues. <br />Enjoy your boys!	2004-04-22

I was suspicious when so many articles and websites and reviews commented that \\"they never knew such and such\\" or that their \\"eyes were opened\\" about church- and art-history. Was this written-for-screenplay-use book being taken seriously?  Apparently so.<br />Beyond the wooden characters, and predictable plot - the guy was seemingly trying to teach or inform the readers about \\"great mysteries.\\" My frustration hit its peak in the first few chapters. He has his art-scholar quoting experts talking about \\"Wicca\\" as an \\"ancient religion.\\" Anyone with three minutes on the internet can discover that Wicca was made up whole-cloth in the past 50 years from the writings of A. Crowley.  The positive reviews seem to have a common thread: they are gleeful. They are enjoying what they perceive as \\"those Catholics/Christian getting theirs, hee-heehumor.  Likewise, liking a book because it proves a point is not the same as the enjoyment of a good beach-book.<br />Thumbs down. For those who were concerned or \\"never knew...\\" some of the \\"facts\\" presented - a little research will do the trick. This pulp-fiction bodice-ripper of a detective story has not undone 2000 years of history and understanding.

Every few pages is an insight passed off as fact, or research. Among the his \\"insights\\" is that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were sexual, and that \\"The Church\\" crushed this fact. And that there are \\"other gospels other than the \\"few\\" in the bible.\\"  That feminism was the truth that the Church eliminated. The \\"well-searched\\" book actually describes \\"Wicca\\" as an ancient religion. It was made up from the writings of Aliester Crowley within the last century.  Those who believe Kwanzaa is an African holiday, will believe that Wicca is an ancient religion.<br />The author has stated in interviews: \\"was she [Magdalene] Jesus' wife, partner, confidante, beloved disciple, the \\"apostle to the apostles\\"? All this and more, says \\"Code\\" author Dan Brown. \\"I was skeptical, but after a year and a half of research, I became a believer,\\" says Brown. \\"As soon as people understand that the few Gospels included in the Bible are not the only version of the Christ story, they begin to sense contradictions. Magdalene is most obvious.\\"<br />Written with that breathless style that gets one believing that the CIA killed Kennedy, or that the Air Force is suppressing UFO information.<br />Ignorance gives free speech an advantage.

Then the author's shallow understanding of Christian and pagan symbolism start getting ini the way. Or was his use of Robert Bly or Anthony Campbell as &quot;research?&quot; He wishes to pit &quot;ancient goddess worship&quot; against Christian history. Then he tosses in lines about &quot;Isis, Wicca, Venus, and other ancient traditions...&quot;  Wicca was invented within our lifetimes (lifted whole cloth from Aleister Crowley), not withstanding the popular and uncritical acceptance of this hoax by popular culture.)  The author has the &quot;scholar&quot; discussing the &quot;perfect&quot; pentagon that the planet Venus is supposed to draw in the sky every four years. The church stamped this knowledge out, too?<br />I found myself wanting to toss this book across the room every chapter or two, for the silly &quot;historical&quot; notions that are introduced as fact. One could almost hear the author's thinking, &quot;People don't know about this stuff, let's leave it in!&quot; Just the way TV directors might leave in scenes with telephone wires in the background during a Western. &quot;People won't notice, it is only on screen for 5 seconds, and everyone is half-asleep anyway.

O'Brien's thesis is that children must learn their moral ABC's as well as the letters of the alphabet. The classic tales for children has always been morality tales where \\"good guys\\" and \\"bad guys\\" are clearly delineated. Evil is not something to be \\"understood\\" or \\"rehabilitated\\" but conquered - in ourselves and in the world.<br />The blurry greys of adult fare now infects children's stories, and it leaves them bewildered and ill-equiped for the realities of the world.<br />\\"Dragons\\" refers to the classic figures in old stories - they are to be faced, turned away, killed. Further, O'Brien is speaking to the Christian, and speaks clearly. \\"The Dragon\\" would love to have a moral landscape where no one believes in evil. It allows the con-man to creep right in before destroying you. Even those who are not theologically trained, or believers in the Christian faith will welcome O'Brien's logic, and recommendations. And his honesty in laying bare his influences.<br />He has a very nice list of recommendations in his appendices, and my kids have been eating them up.<br />This is a wonderful, necessary book for fathers of sons.	2003-02-04

Lewis & Aldous Huxley	Books	5	13	14	N	Y	Wonderful dialog, delightful read	Kreeft is quite good at this ancient art of the socartic dialog!  <br />Lewis takes the role of the classic Christian, Huxley the classic pantheist (fancy word for what we now call &quot;newage&quot;), and Kennedy the  classic humanist.<br />Interesting side note: Lewis died peacefully in his  sleep.  Huxley died while on LSD.  Kennedy was shot by a political  enemy.<br />Bill	1999-06-04

Having read many survival and endurance books, I found this one exemplary. Written with quiet recollection - as only a log-keeping seaman could - he recounts both the inner and outer journey very well. <br />I was appreciative of his honesty in the emotional shortcomings of himself and crew. You can imagine the difficulty of being so revealing of your own family in print! Without these insights, a reader would have been mislead about what it means to survive with others. I also listened to an unabridged book-on-tape, and the idea of a long story, well told, detail by detail was wonderful. <br />For someone who has waited out storms on the sides of mountains, I appreciate long, detailed, unhurried stories. This is a wonderful book.	1998-05-13

Written for the Christian, certainly useful to a Jewish student.  He explains the necessary task of discovering what the original meaning of the text meant to the writer and first readers - hermeneutics - (to the best of our ability), and how to apply it to our lives today - exegesis.  Why do we think \\"Love your neighbor as yourself\\" applies to us in 1997, but \\"Do not mingle cotton and linen\\" should stay back in the first centuries?  What principles allow us to make this choice?  They come from the same text.  Far from shaking your faith, it will give you tools to discover and explain WHY you believe what you believe. This is often a more valuable step in witnessing to friends than telling them why THEY should believe it.  A thin book, easily read, but will engage the serious scholar as well as the novice.	1997-11-07
