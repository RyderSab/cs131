Winstom Groom has written a terrific book around the subject of the year 1942.  After laying some WWII groundwork (cause/effect), he shows the devastation that our country faced after Pearl Harbor. A country of isolationists became a country set on justice, but found themselves without the tools to fight the war.  He develops how we as a country rose to the challenge of a World War, working with our allies to defeat the Axis.   <br />Groom delves into the popular details, along with the \\"nooks and crannies\\" of the war.  He does not present the facts in dry detail as some historians do, but makes history come alive with human details.   <br />As to the remarks of a previous reviewer regarding the fact that Groom presents no new facts, perhaps he should have read the introduction where the author tells his readers that this book is not for the WWII buff who knows everything, but for the common person who desires a better understanding regarding the events that made this war the defining event of the 20th century.	2005-10-05

It follows the same format of other non-Alex Cross works which are co-written with other authors: Short Chapters/Shallow Characters. <br />This book features John O'Hara, an F.B.I. agent assigned to the case of Nora Sinclair, a potential \\"black widow\\" who has several men she is involved with die under mysterious circumstances.  His challenge is to investigate her without getting caught in her web.  The book is \\"mindless drivel\\".  Bring back Alex Cross.	2005-10-03

That said, Mr. Silva has written an intriguing work set with the all-too-real world of terrorism as backdrop.  Michael Osborne is a C.I.A. analyst who works in a relatively safe world after beginning his career as a field agent.  When an airliner is shot down off the coast of New York, Michael begins to take interest when the murderer is found dead, his body bearing the marks of an unknown killer with whom Michael has a past.  As Michael begins to investigate, he finds that the conspiracy is world-wide and there is more to the tragedy than it first appeared.  A decent read.	2005-09-15

The book is about alleged appearances by the Virgin Mary throughout the last 100 years.  Father Colin Michener, the Papal Secretary, is brought into a potential conspiracy by his mentor, Pope Clement.  We find that there has been a conspiracy by past Popes to cover up a part of \\"The Third\\" Secret\\", which is part of a Marian appearance.

This book, set in present day, is about the Russian people getting a czar from the Romanov line, which was ushered out (via assasination) in 1917 by the Bolsheviks.  Miles Lord, an Atlanta corporate attorney is asked to review the history of the leading pretender to the throne.  As he delves into this background, an attempt is made on his life.  He then uncovers, in a Davinci Code-like manner, that a direct Romanov descendant could still be alive.  The subject matter might be more interesting than the novel itself, but still, after a slow start, a pretty decent read.	2005-07-28

Regardless of how you feel about Zell Miller, I think all would have to agree that it is unusual in this day for a politician, albeit a retired one, to speak from the heart.

Donald Davis has done an exeptional job of explaining the war in the Pacific as well as taking us through the mission to eliminate Japanese Admiral Yamamoto. <br />The Pacific war seems to take a backseat to the European Theater in WWII.  In this work, Davis shows us how Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor evoked outrage from the American people and how the military decided to make the war in Europe as priority.   <br />As to the mission to eliminate Yamamoto, perhaps the most fascinating part of the story is the aftermath of Yamamoto's death and the political manuevering to take credit for the kill. <br />This is a fast read that gives a real feel for life in the jungles of the Islands of the Pacific during WWII.	2005-05-22

Having been a Christian for over 30 years, I for one view what Heaven is differently after reading the book.   <br />The premise of the book is that there is an intermediate heaven to which believers go when they die and that the eternal heaven is actually a restored Earth.  The author's views, though scripturally based in most cases, will still challenge many, whom if they are honest, find that their views of many things in the Christian life are merely a compilation of what their teachers and pastors have taught.	2005-01-04

Mr. Demille shows his breadth as a writer in this book, having a wise-cracking, Myron Bolitar-like main character such as Corey. <br />The time is July of 2001.  John Corey's wife, a fellow F.B.I. agent, baits him into looking into the crash of TWA Flight 800, which was pronounced a victim of mechanical failure five years earlier by the investigating authorities.   <br />Corey learns of a couple that may have accidentally taped the event while filming themselves gettin' jiggy with it on the beach.  Against the wishes of the of the F.B.I. and any other government agency, Corey digs into the incident, trying to locate the couple and subsequently the tape.  <br />The book picks up speed, ending the only way it can.

I usually am not a fan of english authors, but Ms. McDermid spins a heck of a good tale, so I am hooked.  This book begins in 1978 when four drunken college chums stumble upon the body of a local girl.  Though suspected, they are never charged of the crime.  The first part of the book deals with the group and dealing with the suspicions of others.   <br />The second part of the book fast forwards to 2003 and two of the four are killed under suspicious conditions.  When the remaining two begin to dig deeper into the crime, the plot thickens and they find themselves uncovering details about the case.

I am not usually a fan of English mysteries, finding them a little too slow for my tastes.  The story begins in 1963 in a small village.  A 13 year old girl disappears and the police, led by young detective George Bennett, are called in.  George, assisted by his assistant, Tommy Clough, is immediately drawn in by the case and by the village of Scardale, a world unto it's own.  As the investigation continues, an arrest is made for the murder of the missing girl, presumed dead. <br />The story picks up 35 years later, when the retired George Bennett agrees to sit down with an author to write a book about the case.  On the eve of the novel going to press, George contacts the author to insist that the book not go to press, citing new evidence.  What ensues is a fascinating end to an intricate novel.	2004-11-16

What I have always loved about this author's work is his ability to captivate me with a mystery from the start, then keep me guessing until the end.  This book did neither. <br /> <br />The book centers around a renowned archaeologist, Walt Gaines, and his wife, Jocelyn.  When Jocelyn is killed at the end of a dig, Walt and his three adult sons are devastated.  After the funeral, Walt quits his job at the University of Wisconsin, moves to California and severs practically all contact with his family. <br /> <br />The sons investigate, and find a lifestyle that is inconsistent with Walt's means.

This, coupled with Walt's mysterious new life spurs them on to discover all they can find out about the past.   <br /> <br />While a fascinating character study, I found the book to be slow in places and missing the aforementioned formula that makes this author a favorite.   <br /> <br />This one is far from being a priceless relic.	2004-09-21

I am amazed at Patterson's ability in the Alex Cross series to produce a good solid story and develop the characters and up until this book, I held the same opinion of the W.M.C. books.  This one seemed to me like a book that was written in a very short amount of time. The plot seemed thrown together and the characters did not seem as seamless as in the past.  I would be willing to wait a while for the next book if it translated into Patterson books of the past.	2004-04-12

I saw &quot;Fatal Flaw&quot; in the book store and was intrigued by the storyline.  I picked it up and hardly put it down until I was finished.  The story consists of Attorney Victor Carl defending his old law school classmate as the latter is accused in the murder of his fiance.  Victor was also intimately involved with the murder victim and takes the case to make sure that the defendant is found guilty, believing he has committed the crime.  As the story unfolds, Victor begins to have his doubts, and as he delves deep into the past of the murder victim, the plot thickens as they say.  This is a real page turner and Mr. Lashner's lengthy narratives are very enjoyable.  How much did I enjoy this book?  Before I finished &quot;Fatal Flaw&quot; I was the owner of Mr. Lashner's other books, sitting in my literary on-deck circle.	2004-04-06

I was a bit skeptical because most of the time the authors of these type of books get overly technical.  However, I took the advice of a fellow Amazon reviewer and I am glad I did.  The book is about a stolen defense contractor's plans for a ultra-stealthy plane that is invisible.  The Chinese have developed the plane and use it to attack the Tiawanese president's plane, thus igniting a war.  The U.S. Aircraft Carrier in the area gets involved to try and frustrate the Chinese' efforts.  I found this an interesting, fast moving book and Brick Maxwell is a believable, yet swash-buckling hero.	2004-04-02

She was right, it did read fast and it was an excellent story.  The main character, who I believe probably represents the author, writes a book about his wife's relationship with her father, culminating with his death.  His book finds immediate success and revolves around the blessings and curses found with such popularity.  Think: It's a Wonderful Life in book form.  It is definitely worth the time.	2004-03-25

Dave Chasen is brought back into the C.I.A. to help the company locate two items: A laptop computer with technology that has cutting edge defense information and the &quot;Professio&quot; an alleged document that Saint Peter signed denouncing Jesus as the Christ.  Throw in a Spanish Corleone family, a secret agent priest and a MI6 agent and you have the makings of a book that has an interesting premise but falls short in delivering the goods.	2004-03-23

This book is a collection of stories that form the man, Edward Bloom, a never serious traveling salesman.  The book is told from his son's perspective as his Father lay on his death bed.  While the stories were sometimes entertaining and humorous, they seemed disconnected.  The ending, while a bit far fetched (staying with the whole tone of the book) did serve to drive one point home to Mr. Bloom's son:  That the jokes and stories that made up his impressions of his Father, the ones that he grew to resent, in the end became the manner in which his Father communicated with the people in his life.	2004-03-22

After a slow start, Mr. Beausay gives practical advice in recognizing the changes that boys are going through and there inability to express how they feel at a given moment.  I found the chapters directed to encouraging them most helpful.  I highly recommend this work.	2004-03-22

Life Sentence revolves around the gubernatorial campaign of Grant Tully and his chief counsel Jon Soliday.  Into this mix comes a blackmail letter, with hints of an event in these two men's lives twenty years prior.  What follows is a story that includes murder, double cross and plot twists.  I heartily recommend this book!	2004-03-17

However, &quot;The Footprints of God&quot; was just a bit much for me.  I felt like I was reading a hybrid of Steven Hawking/Michael Crichton/Robert Ludlum (still writing from the grave).  The book centers around Dr. David Tenant, a doctor brought into the Trinity project for ethical monitoring.  The Trinity Project centers around one man's vision for the development of artificial intelligience.  Dr. Tenant finds his colleague, Dr. Fielding, murdered and he begins to fear for his life.  The result is a plot filled with chases, hallucinations and a final showdown in the desert with a Max-style (2001: A Space Odyssey) computer.  While I admire his flexibility in subjects, my desire is for Greg Iles to come back to the mainstream.	2004-03-11

Keith is the real deal.  He weaves stories about his life into the principles he reveals about how much our attitude effects our lives and the lives of those around us.  He obviously has a relationship with God, and he uses that relationship as the foundation stone for his belief system.  I highly recommend this book for adults and teenagers alike.	2004-03-05

This book revolves around a skull found after a hurricane.  Louis Kincaid's curiouosity draws him to the skull and when a body is found in the bay, he wonders if they could somehow be related.<BR>He is asked by the local police to assist in investigating the murder along with a surly detective.  What unfolds is a plot that covers 30 years and the skeletons in one family's closet. Louis' relationship with Detective Lendetta is a fascinating one that adds to the dark side of the book.  <BR>I will definitely be reading more of P.J. Parrish.	2004-03-03

While this book did not overly impress me, I can see where Whit Mosley would be a much more entertaining character given another setting.  <BR>The book centers around Mosley, a Justice of the Peace in a small Texas town.  Mosley's father is on his death bed and Whit sets out to find his mother who left the family thirty years previous.  What he finds is a mother who has re-invented herself as an accountant for a mob family.  Whit finds himself involved in a plot that includes murder, deception and vengeance.  <BR>While certainly readable, this book did not engross me as I had hoped it would, but it kept me interested enough to persuade me to give this author another try.	2004-02-24

The story is centers around a murder committed 7 years in the past.  As a result, the man convicted for the slaying of most of a family is awaiting execution.  As times draws near for the execution, the prosecution's star witness, the lone surviving family member, recants her testimony that put the alleged killer on death row.  The rest of the story moves quickly, delving into the sins and secrets of the past.  I found it a solid mystery that kept my attention the whole way.	2004-02-18

I read about the author, Walter Sorrells (Ruth Birmingham is a pen name) a few weeks ago in the newspaper and purposed to pick up one of his books.  I was not disappointed.  The mystery revolves around Sunny Childs, a single thirty-something who works for an Atlanta private investigations firm.  After a suicide committed by one of her late Father's fellow soldiers, she yearns to find out more about her Father, killed in Vietnam.  In addition, she is asked to look into the death of the fellow soldier by his disbelieving widow.  The ensuing story unfolds with a complex plot filled with intrigue, deception, lies and attrocities involving the Vietnam era.  <BR>I highly recommend this book as a good mystery and an excellent dissection of the effect of the past on all of us.	2004-02-12

The first two titles had a mystical feel to the mystery found in the book.  This one was more of a main stream tale, and the concepts presented were almost Michael Palmerish.  <BR>The story is about a small town policeman, down on his luck, who stumbles onto a murder conspiracy involving the F.B.I., Persian War vets and ethics in medical development.  The yarn moves quickly and it will certainly keep the reader's attention, just not to the extent that the previous works did.	2004-01-30

This book is one that makes you think. It is an entertaining yarn about a man who by all of his actions would appear to be Jesus in the 21st century.  Mr. Maier makes us think, do we know enough about the future to definitively say that how we would respond.  I heartily recommend this to all readers and I ask Mr. Maier not to make us wait so long for his next work of fiction.	2004-01-27

The story, while a bit fantastic, is also very well told. Twin brothers, seperated at birth, but still growing up in the same state, live lives that closely resemble one another.  The story covers some forty years, with a crescendo of an ending that pits them as rivals.  I am normally a thriller reader, but this captivated me as a story of two men who share an unknown secret.  Highly enjoyable!	2004-01-12

Dirk is much more introspective, soul searching, etc.  The story itself I would rate as a little better than the average Dirk Pitt novel.  I would recommend this as a must read for Pitt fans because of the changes that he experiences during the book.  It will be interesting to see where he goes from here.	2004-01-05

As a sometimes fan of Stuart Woods, and as a reader of all the Will Lee novels, I picked this book up to stay in the loop.  Let me say that I loved Chiefs, liked Grass Roots and Run Before the Wind, and tolerated The Run.  However, this was just all too predictable from beginning to end.  Mr. Woods puts out so many books that it seems like he is just spewing words out of his computer.  If you are looking for a thriller, read David Baldacci's Split Second.	2003-12-23

As a late baby boomer, I grew up in the era of the anti-communism, and as a result, I was fearful of &quot;the Communists&quot; without knowing why.  This book brings things full circle for me.  <BR>The novel begins with the recruitment of C.I.A. agents in the early 1950's and follows their careers for nearly 50 years.  At the same time, the novel adresses key Cold War happennings such as early post-war Germany, the Bay of Pigs, and the attempted Russian revolution in the Gorbachev era.  The novel is written around history and speculates (to some degree) what the C.I.A.'s role was in shaping these events.  <BR>The nearly 900 pages read quickly as we the reader attempts to decipher the identity of the Soviet mole who has been in the hierarchy of the U.S. government for the balance of the novel.<BR>This book has intrigue, great interpersonal plots and is also educational as to the history and involvement of the C.I.A. in the Cold War.	2002-06-11

From the outset, it is very clear that Paul Brenner is taking the same pilgrimmage that the author encountered in 1997 as a Vietnam veteran. <BR>Brenner has a mystery dangled in front of him, drawing the reader in, but, alas, the mystery really only figures in the last 150 pages of the 700 page novel.<br />Instead, the book is largely about coming to terms with the Vietnam experience, 30 years later. While very educational, the book also addresses issues such as present day U.S.-Vietnam relations, the irony of dialogue with former enemies, and the need to come to terms with the past. <br />I would strongly encourage Vietnam veterans to experience this book. It is a wonderful novel.	2002-03-06

I must say that I was impressed enough to go out and purchase Full Dress Gray's prequel, &quot;Dress Gray.&quot; Ry Slaight, the book's protagonist is  everything I look for in a story: A person of principle; Upstanding, yet  real. As for the story itself, it gives the reader an insider's look at a  military school and it's rules and codes, written and unwritten.  I was  reminded of Pat Conroy's book, &quot;The Lords of Discipline. This book  combines an intriguing setting mixed with a dash of suspense that will keep  the reader turning pages long over bedtime.	2000-01-04
