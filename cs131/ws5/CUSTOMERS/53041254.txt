This is a book you definitely have to have if you play live poker.<br /><br />Even though the book is a bit outdated in terms of the photos the information it contains is invaluable.<br /><br />The book covers most physical and verbal tells that amateurs and pros alike exhibit.  Learn how to tell when a player wants you to call or wants you to fold.  Learn when they didn't hit their hand and you can bluff them off the pot, or when thy hit it huge and are praying that you bet into them.<br /><br />This is a must have book for your collection.<br /><br />The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because of the outdated photos.  If they release a new updated version with the same info then it's a 5 star book!	2005-04-13

This is just another of the low quality books put out under the &#34;Tom Clancy&#34; name.<br /><br />The book is written by Jerome Preisler and is by far one of the worst books I've read in some time.<br /><br />The plot is very poorly defined, and is so poorly followed that 1/2 the time you are left trying to figure out how a chapter fit into the rest of the book.<br /><br />Character development was minimal at best, and completely missing at worst.<br /><br />There were two main plot lines that had virtually nothing to do with each other, and trying to follow them simply made the book unreadable.<br /><br />My advice is that you don't waste your time on this sell out of a &#34;Tom Clancy&#34; novel.<br /><br />As a 20 year member of Amazon I rely on independent reviews when shopping.

If you are interested in improving your poker game, then do not get this book!<br />I found this book to be a complete waste of time.  The majority of the book was Phil trying to inflate is already large ego.<br />The basis of Phil's book is to only play the top 10 hands.  In his opinion you'll win more than you'll learn.  But in reality within a few hours everyone will have pinned you on what you play and you'll get no action when you do go in.<br />Phil advises you to be &#34;tight and aggressive&#34;, but gives nothing to demonstrate how you should do this.  He gives little information on post flop play and practically ignores fourth and fifth street play.<br />I found virtually nothing useful in this book.  My advice is do not buy this book!!  You'll only be sorry you did.<br />Try any of David Sklansky's books instead, you won't be sorry.<br /><br />As a 20 year member of Amazon I rely on independent reviews when shopping.

In this book Joanna is running for sheriff of Cochise County, Arizona.<br />The author, J.A. Jance,  does a good job of detailing the life of Brady and I felt that I got to know her fairly well throughout the story.  I thought she did an exceptional job of outlining the relationship between mother and daughter during a rough period in their lives.<br />This well written book takes you through the life of Brady as she runs for Sheriff just at a time that two murders are discovered in her town.  The murders revolve around a 30 year old family feud of a respected family in this small town.<br />Although the book was fairly slow to start it picked up quickly towards the end.  Maybe a bit too quickly for my taste as I felt some things were left unexplored.<br />Overall I found this to be an entertaining book, even though I hadn't read the first in the series.  I recommend it to anyone who wants a bit of a mystery in an easy to read book.<br /><br />As a 20 year member of Amazon I rely on independent reviews when shopping.

Time is critical as two witnesses need to be kept alive over the weekend so they can testify against a known felon.  However this is no typical killer, once you hire him you cannot change your mind.  He will kill the targets at all costs... unless he can be stopped.<br />The book is a fast paced novel that sucks you in and keeps you there.

Skink is a fun and colorful character that gave up on politics to live the life of a recluse in the everglades.  He is appalled by what is happening to Florida and every once in a while goes off the deep end.<br />The story is fast passed, and kept me interested from cover to cover.  The characters are well developed and I found myself truly feeling for the good guys, and repulsed by the bad guys.<br />Over all I found this to be a very easy read, and very entertaining.	2002-09-18

Captain James Winters is accused of committing a murder he didn't commit.  His own agency seems set to take him down for this crime, and it's up to the Net Force Explorers to prove that he didn't commit the crime of murder.<br />This is an excellent book that kept me interested throughout the story.  There isn't as much action as other Net Force books, but the story is good and there's enough action to keep you reading.<br />This one is worth the money, buy it today, you won't be disappointed.	2001-09-06
US	53041254	R2U0B44AH1AKIF	0440221471	692576280	The Runaway Jury	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Not one of his better works.	At the time I read this book I was on a big Grisham binge. I loved his early works and had high hopes for this book. Unfortunately this book didn't live up to the standard he had set in his other books (The Firm, The Pelican Brief).<br />The story revolves around a large tobacco suit. Much of the story is spent in the courtroom hearing the arguments for and against tobacco use. The rest of the story is about the jury and the manipulation of the jury by outside forces.<br />Although as with other Grisham books I found fascinating information on jury selection, sequestering, etc. the story just didn't have the pull I was looking for. The ending was predictable and seemed to have been penned quickly to finish the book.<br />If you are a diehard Grisham fan, then read this book. Otherwise pick up one of his earlier books for an excellent read.	2001-08-29

He's hoping to find acceptance in the great melting pot of America. Unfortunately he lands in redneck Georgia and is met with contempt and racism from the minute he washes ashore.<br />It's all down hill from there for Hiro in his attempts to make it to the city of brotherly love.<br />This book was given to me by a friend with assurances that I would love it. How wrong he was.<br />I found the writing to be tedious and over done. Much of the time I spent reading I was thinking &quot;who cares?&quot;. While the characters were well developed much of the book was spent on details that didn't seem to matter to the story.<br />I would have just stopped reading it about 1/2 way through if I didn't have a hang up on not finishing a book I start. My recommendations on this book are to spend your money elsewhere.	2001-08-29

Within minutes his skin tingles, his eyes sharpen, and his muscles bulge.  This new designer drug gives its users the strength of superman and the brains of Einstein, if only the user doesn't go crazy first.<br />Net Force's job is to find out who is manufacturing this drug and stop him before the drug kills more people.<br />Should the pharmaceutical companies or the military find the person first the results could be disastrous!<br />This is the fifth book in the Tom Clancy created Net Force series.  It's a fast paced, action packed novel that's easy to read and will keep you interested from start to finish.  While these novels don't have the highly developed characters, and immense detail of Clancy's earlier works they are still very entertaining.	2001-08-15

I bought this book to help me transition from HP/UX to Solaris.  I hoped it would provide me with Solaris specific information for common unix administrative tasks.<br />Unfortunately I was sadly disappointed.  The book covers many topics but the information provided is so minimal as to be useless.<br />For example the book gives you detailed information on what information is contained in sendmail packets, but doesn't tell you much of anything about how to install or configure sendmail.<br />In addition there are many typos and errors in the book which is very distracting from the content.<br />Over all I was very disappointed in this book.

This is an excellent book for someone starting out in investing.  It teaches you WJ O'Neil's CANSLIM method of picking stocks.<br />What's CANSLIM you ask?  CANSLIM is a method of picking stocks developed by William J. O'Neil.

I found this book to be an excellent guide for someone relatively new to HP-UX administration.<br />The book does a good job of breaking down available commands for each function and telling you in a concise but clear manner what each command is for.  For example for file system commands it provides:<br />extendfs:  Use this command after lvextend.  Whereas the lvextend command expands the logical volume, extendfs expands the file system within the logical volume.  if you forget to issue the extendfs command, the logical volume inside SAM will look expanded, but issuing the bdf command will not show the expansion.<br />In addition it provides the man pages for each command listed in a chapter.  Some may say you don't need to pay for this as man pages are free.  However I found it very useful if I wanted to read a man page while doing a command.  In addition it is much easier on your eyes to read a printed man page instead of online.<br />The book walks you through seting up an HP-UX system, bulding the file system, putting it on the network, running auditing and backing up and recovering a system.  In addition it shows you how SAM, glance plus, and perfview work.<br />The book provides you a chapter on VI, which is often a source of major head aches for people new to Unix.  It also provides a chapter on scripting to help you when you need to write or modify a shell script.<br />Over all I am very happy with this book and can recommend it to any HP-UX admins outside of the &quot;greybeard&quot; experts.	2001-03-30

Finally there is a chapter on how to treat each type of illness so you don't have to guess on what to do. This is definitely a book that every fish keeper should have.

I have to admit I was a bit disappointed when I got this book.  It wasn't that the book wasn't good, but it simply wasn't incredible, which is what I expected.<br />The book does a good job of describing the major families of cichlids.  Detail is provided about where they come from, what the environment there is like, and general information about the temperment of that family of fish.<br />Unfortunately there isn't always details about each individual fish.<br />The book provides a color picture of most fish, although the quaility is sometimes lacking.
