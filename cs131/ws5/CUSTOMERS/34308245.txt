US	34308245	R7B8HBABDC0UG	0375727019	185430326	The Elementary Particles	Books	5	4	9	N	N	Ideas	The storyline of \\"The Elementary Particles\\" is really fairly simple: two half-brothers (one a sex-obsessed, self-loathing teacher, and the other a distant, emotionally detached scientist) find redemptive, middle-aged romance, lose it, and then meet their fates. However, there's a LOT going on in this book. While recounting the stories of half-brothers Bruno and Michel, the author bombards the reader with ideas; about science, sex, family, religion, philosophy, sociology and the human condition. Yet somehow the books remains an engaging and enjoyable read, never seeming dry or pretentious.<br /><br />Michel Houellebecq is my new favorite writer. I'd also recommend the political sex-fest of \\"Platform\\".	2005-04-18

I can only highly, emphatically recommend it. This book is the first introduction I've had to Rumi, and it's been an incredible literary experience for me. This book has really touched and inspired me. I've been reading it slowly over the last few months, digesting it bit by bit, because I wanted to savor it instead of rushing through it. One day in particular, I remember being in a foul mood, fed up with people and the world, and after reading a handful of Rumi's poems I felt peaceful and transformed. If you have any interest at all in spirituality or poetry, do yourself a favor and buy this book.	2005-01-20

LeRoy's other book, &quot;The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things&quot;, it's hard to tell while reading &quot;Sarah&quot; whether what you're reading is a memoir, fiction, or some combination of the two. Whatever the case, &quot;Sarah&quot; is an entertaining, provocative and often funny read. Whereas the stories in &quot;Heart&quot; were realistic, disturbing accounts of horrific child abuse and the ramifications, &quot;Sarah&quot; reads more like a deranged fairy tale, set in the strange world of southern truck stop prostitution. The main character is an abused and neglected 12-year-old boy who decides to become a truck stop prostitute both as a way to compete with and reach out to his prostitute mother. While pursuing his \\"dream,\\" he comes across a vast array of colorful, crazy and over-the-top characters, including deified pimps, superstitious hookers and perverse trucker johns. Although missing in action for most of this book, the presence of the title character and main character's mother, Sarah, is always felt, as he is constantly yearning for her approval, her attention, and her love.<br />Sometimes there's a good reason behind \\"hype\\": J.T. Leroy is a remarkable talent.	2004-05-10

Ultimately, I suppose it doesn't really matter: \\"The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things\\" is an extraordinary book either way.<br />Jeremiah, the young protagonist, is a child totally at the mercy of all the adults in his life, who are all insane, predatory and heartless. He is horrifically abused physically, sexually and psychologically until he completely loses all sense of self and identity. The tales are told so lucidly and honestly that the reader can completely understand why Jeremiah eventaully both learns to mistake pain for love and wages a personal war against his own body and sexual identity.<br />In a way Jeremiah's story is a metaphor for how our exploitive society eventually destroys all our children's sense of self. God help us all.	2004-03-18

The main character, Larry, is much more than your average troubled, misguided youth. He is truly psychotic, and on the brink of a major meltdown with horrifying consequences.<br /><br />The death of his friend Rand, who dies of natural causes after Larry punches him, starts Larry on a downward spiral. He gets absolutely no help from his alcoholic mother or his cancer-stricken father, and even his detached, condescending psychiatrist fails to help him. Larry eventually finds himself involved in a murder plot instigated by a wannabe skinhead named Gilman, and that's when everything starts escalating into a true bloodbath.<br /><br />After the Columbine tragedy, there was a lot of fingerpointing going on, but I've seen few people really dare to try to get inside the head of a young person disturbed enough to turn to such extreme violence. Dennis Cooper, as usual, dares to explore the dark corners of the human psyche that most of us are too afraid to venture into.	2003-12-22

And yet, universal as it is, it's a subject that's rarely really dealt with. &quot;White Noise&quot; dares to deal with the subject head on. It explores the various ways human beings attempt to deal with their fear of death. Some choose to analyze the human condition intellectually, hoping to find freedom that way. Some try to medicate their fears away. Others attempt to face death through daredevil stunts. And then there are those who find a strange relief in violence and the domination of other people. &quot;White Noise&quot; offers no real comfort or solutions to the human condition, but it is a clever, entertaining, and thought-provoking read.	2003-11-28

Although I could appreciate the dark, twisted, imaginative imagery, there was just no real story to speak of. There were hints of satire here and there, but then the prose would just descend into an incoherent mess.

I'm glad I did. It really helped me to understand things about myself that I'd struggled with for years. Before, I didn't understand why I'd freak out in crowds, why I'd often find myself retreating to stairwells or restrooms for solitude at work or school, or why large social gatherings often exhausted me when other people seemed energized by them. This book explains that highly sensitive people (HSPs) are simply a significant segment of the population born with a sensitive nervous system, and as a result are easily overstimulated and overwhelmed. It covers the pros and cons of being an HSP, and helps HSPs understand, accept and embrace who they are. If you suspect you are an HSP (or are married to or are the parent of one), I'd highly recommend this book.	2003-11-12

What is it that motivates Sabina? Is it a thirst for adventure? Lust? Resentment towards her husband or the roles society imposes on her? Instead of being a trite morality tale where the &quot;sinner&quot; is punished by facing horrible consequences (like the recent film &quot;Unfaithful&quot;) this book explores, without judgement, Sabina's conflicted emotions and motives.	2003-11-10

It helped me to redefine the way I think about pleasure and society's relationship to it. I was raised with such a puritanical &quot;if it feels good, it must be evil&quot; way of thinking that Leary's point of view - &quot;if it feels good, it's probably good for you&quot; - was downright liberating for me. Although I don't subscribe to everything Leary says in the book (for example, I don't think doing LSD once a week is a good idea), his essays are always provocative and full of food for thought. Even if you're put off by Leary's associations with hippie and drug cultures, I'd still recommend reading this book. Leary was an intelligent man with ideas worth listening to.	2003-10-28

He ingeniously draws from an article he wrote for \\"Spin\\" magazine about a handful of teenage runaways, and blends reality, fiction and fantasy to create a shocking and original novel. Is what takes place in \\"Guide\\" a truthful look into Cooper's own fantasy life? Or is it merely his way of showing how society sexually exploits and degrades young people?

Books	5	76	79	N	N	Engrossing memoir of a tortured, complicated woman	This book is not only my favorite autobiography, but it's also one of my favorite books of any genre. Francis Farmer, the infamous movie star who ended up institutionalized, was a tortured woman. This autobiography, which she wrote shortly before her death, is an extremely well-written, brutally honest, and mostly unflattering self-portrait. She tells of her relationship with her controlling and insane mother (who committed her), her unintentional rise to fame in Hollywood (she wanted to be a theater actress, and found Hollywood mostly empty), her emotional breakdowns, run-ins with the law, drinking problems, loveless marriages, and her time spent in a horrific state mental institution. Despite it all, Francis Farmer doesn't seem to feel a lot of self-pity, and she admirably takes responsibility for much of what happened to her. What really makes the book touching is Francis' description of what ultimately saved her: her friendship with Jean Radcliffe (who published the book after Francis died). Toward the end of her life Francis was able to find a lot of love and happiness, mostly due to the unconditional support she received from Jean and her family. This makes the book not only a juicy tale of a fallen Hollywood star and a disturbing memoir of a mental hospital, but an ultimately inspiring story about the healing power of love and friendship.	2003-10-10

Unlike the ultra gory American Psycho, this book is disturbing and darkly funny in a mostly realistic way. It's about a group of spoiled students at the fictional Camden College who, for the most part, spend all their time smoking, drinking, doing drugs, and having sex. Despite all their wealth and access to substances, the characters are all miserable and emotionally crippled, unable to really relate to other human beings. Paul, who's sensitive and gay, falls for bad boy Sean Bateman. Sean (brother of American Psycho's Patrick Bateman, who makes a brief cameo in this book) is a promiscous drug user who falls for virginal Lauren. Lauren, however, is hopelessly in love with Sean's friend Victor. It's both sad and hilarious the way all the characters have fixated on other people who cannot return their feelings. And although I'd like to think most college kids aren't this screwed up, this novel does reflect in many ways the confusion and craziness of life post-high school.	2003-10-04

The protagonist is a young man, Meursault, who has a strangely detached, and yet benevolent, way of looking at the world. Mostly, he lives moment to moment, resigned and seemingly unmoved by most of what happens around him (including his mother's death). After a series of unfortunate events, Meursault finds himself on trial for murder, and those responsible for his fate mistake his detachment for evil and callousness. This novel shows how society treats people who are different, and how people are all too quick to label people &quot;evil&quot; that they don't understand.	2003-10-04

Throughout the stages of his life, the tree continually gives everything she has to meet his needs. Every time the tree gives of herself to the little boy, no matter how big the sacrifice, the book proclaims \\"and the tree was happy\\".<br />This book rivals \\"the Velveteen Rabbit\\" as a children's book that is also timeless and inspiring literature.	2003-10-03

It's the first in an autobiographical trilogy the author wrote, and this first book documents David's life up until the time he was finally rescued from his monstrous, sadistic mother.

The result is an entertaining, if somewhat lightweight, read. The structure of the book itself is a bit of a gimmick, with each of the chapters of the book being about one particular \\"deadly sin\\". This makes the book easy to read, although not particularly in depth. Dan does make some very good points (that not everybody who uses drugs recreationally is an addict, that not everyone is wired for monogamy), and it's also interesting and admirable the way he treats the \\"pride\\" chapter: as a way of criticizing, instead of glorifying, gay \\"pride\\" events. If there is an underlying theme to this book, it's \\"live and let live\\" ... and with so many public figures constantly moralizing and condemning other people, this is a philosophy our society could use a re-introduction to.	2003-10-01

Esther is 19 years old, and at that age I was feeling and experiencing so many of the same things. The time was different, the specifics were different, and our genders are different, and yet this book hit so close to home that it was uncomfortable, and yet cathartic, to read it. This book perfectly depicts the feeling of being a very young adult in our society, and looking at the world around you and seeing absolutely nothing that appeals to you. It depicts the confusion, pain, isolation, and even insanity that can be the result. I would recommend this book to anyone, but especially to young people who are struggling to find their footing in a society that can be cold, frightening, and overwhelming.	2003-09-28

I found the book to be very well-written. I also found the main character, Harry &quot;Rabbit&quot; Angstrom, to be one of the most unappealing, pathetic and annoying characters in fiction. Rabbit is a formerly celebrated high school athlete who, at 26, has settled into a mundane life as a salesman, husband, and soon-to-be father (his wife is pregnant). Apparently having a quarter-life crisis, he leaves his wife, takes up with a prostitute, starts hanging out with a local minister and takes a job as a gardener. Harry appears to be the kind of person who, due to his good looks and charm, is somehow always able to avoid having to take responsibility for his actions. He is constantly being given second (and third, and fourth) chances by everyone in his life, despite his appalling behavior. He is selfish, aimless and spoiled. I'm sure the author intended that the character provoke this reaction, and intended it as a criticism of suburban American society at the time it was written. But because I found Rabbit to be such an unappetizing character, I have no desire to read any of the sequels to this book.	2003-09-28

The book is made up of a series of vignettes told through the viewpoints of a variety of characters who inhabit the same social circles in Los Angelos. The stories often overlap, and a peripheral character in one vignette is often the main character in another story. In terms of content, it pretty much follows the same themes as &quot;American Psycho&quot; and &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot;: immoral, spoiled, self-absorbed and mostly soulless people living in the early 80's, and having difficulty connecting with or relating to anyone else. This gives the entire book a depressing, bleak tone, but it is also somehow entertaining. Towards the end of the book, a couple of the stories take on a supernatural turn that neither of the other books did, which makes finishing the book worthwhile. Overall, I found the book entertaining, though it is far from being a masterpiece.	2003-09-27

Like most people, I found it shocking and disturbing (and I'm not someone who's easily shocked), but not without merit. It really reads like a dream ... the kind you want to forget as soon as you wake up, and the kind you would never, ever want to describe to anyone else. So there's a definite courageousness to this book. The author had the guts to put all his demons right out there for all the world to see (well, read), and so, as disturbing as the book is, you have to respect that.	2003-09-27

Anyone who has ever read anything by Charles Bukowski knows that he pulls no punches, spilling his guts about his gin-soaked, skid-row life with brutal honesty, humor, and vulgar wit. In Ham on Rye, however, he reveals much more than his adult misadventures. He describes in devastating detail his childhood and adolescence, and after reading it, it is painfully obvious why he would feel the need to spend so much of his life numbing himself with alcohol. This novel truly reveals the pain, sensitivity, hurt and need hiding beneath the macho, crass exterior so many of his readers fell in love with. If he were still alive, I'd be tempted to track him down just to give him a hug.	2003-09-27

Cruddy is a novel about a young girl doing her best to survive under such circumstances. It's part fairy tale, part horror, part John Waters film, and part Huckleberry Finn.

It would be easy to dismiss the book for a variety of reasons: the obscene cover artwork, the fact that it was written by a 20 year old (which I find very impressive, after reading it), the characters are disaffected teens who do a lot of drugs, etc. But I found it to be hilarious, insightful, imaginative, subversive and thoroughly enjoyable. It may not be a traditionally structured story, but it's not full of pointless gimmicks either. Nor is it a self-indulgent stream-of-consciousness mess. The author really just seemed to be following his instincts, and daring to push the boundaries of traditional storytelling. I think this is a young writer to watch out for.	2003-09-21
