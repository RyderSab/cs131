Its a book where alot of us girls want to believe the stories guys give us, even tho back in our heads somewhere we already know the answer but don't want to admit it. <br />This book will make you get out of denial from the excuses we hear and to feel good that your not wasting time anymore on someone who really is just not into you! Hope he writes another one...very entertaining as well as truthful..	2004-11-04

You know the kind of books that you just won't part with, and sometimes you just need them to read over again, well this book is a keeper, He really did a great job through most of the book , I did not not like some of the philosophical things he put in there, but it is a really great book about love and the people in your life!	2003-03-11

First there was too, too much god in there for me and just too much on the philosophical level, if your into things like that, you may like this one but I just could not get interested in this book at all.	2003-03-11

It helped me alot during a time when I needed it, in fact I loan out this book to people who I know who are going through the same thing, a book cannot completely help you, but this one should help see you though and realize alot about yourself and others in the process.	2003-03-11

I did like the book, but I thought the book was rather small and way to short, took me like an hour to read. If maybe it would of had more pages and more content I would highly recommend it, but for those who don't like to read alot and want to learn quick it would be a good for you. He does have a very good way of explaining things and seems to have a good sense of humor, I just think next book he should really get into it!	2002-11-04

I love most of the Seth books, and this one was not too bad, its a shame tho, alot of it, just seemed to be repeated over and over again, till you kinda lose interest.

Well the first half of it anyway, the second half goes a little bit downhill with all the psychology that's makes you lose interest in the rest. This is a book for anyone who has ever been really madly in love (which is most of us)and can't comprehend why you can never get this person away from your thoughts. In short, this book makes you realize your not crazy after all. If your into someone who does not feel the same way as you, this book will explain everything your feeling. She really gets into alot of lack of reciprocation from someone you like/love, which we can all identify with how hard that can be. It will also help you to understand that if you don't think anyone else is going through all this except you, your wrong, your not alone. It really helped me get through a rough period and I think its worth it to read it, this is a book you can truly identify with.	2002-01-24

I found this 2  cassette tape to be very good because on side 2 he also gives you a morning  and evening meditation to do.

I thought Rays book was very good except for I have to agree with  alot of other people as to the parts where he seems to have alot of  animosity toward John Densmore and Oliver Stone..I thought Oliver Stones  movie of the Doors was a very interesting and awesome movie, but I guess  for Ray, alot of it was untrue and therefore does not look at what a  awesome performance Val Kilmer and the other actors really did! But  otherwise I thought he did a great job with the book! Revealing alot of  what really happened from start to finish, gave alot great insights on each  Members personality and spirituality and without everything being just  being about Jim. He does not really get into Pam all that much and  pratically leaves Patrica's name out of it almost competely..All &amp; all  the book is very interesting, but mostly insightful, just when you thought  you knew everything. It's still a hard book to put down once you get  started, not to mention great photos too..	1999-12-13
