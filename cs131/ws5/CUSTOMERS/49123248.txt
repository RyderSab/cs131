Ironically I share the same name of the main character, so I enjoyed the book even more. Over the years I discarded this book, but recently I decided that I need to have in my library despite being an adult. I recommend most of Judy Blume's book to the youth, she is a dynamic author and it will get your children to read more often.<br />11/13/12) So Amazon won't allow me to write an additional review, but I am allowed to edit my original one. As previously stated I first read this book when I was a very very young girl... I loved it then and I am reading it again and I am luving it all over again. I so appreciated Judy Blume books and she didn't have as many then as she does now...  I hope that most little girls will get the opportunity to read \\"Are you there God, it's Me Margaret\\". I love that Margaret just talks to God, the mind of a child can teach and adult... I am try to talk to him the same way now.... Moms...run and get this book for your little girls...	2004-03-26

I checked this book out of the library about two days ago... I finished and dropped it off yesterday. I would recommend this to anyone who feels at a lost when it comes to saving money......<BR>I am going to caution that if your credit card debt is already in collection some of his principles will be hard to follow to the letter... Bascailly he want the reader to go on a credit diet... use only 90%of the income pay instead of the full 100%....Personally I am in deep debt....however I have begun my journey to freedom by writing down all of my accounts,listing them in a large book which is divide into two. The first half is for account that will be paid off.... the second is for monthly payments such as rent,insurance and utilies..... I am reading several other books and taking notes.... once I begin to build my wealth account I will transfer some of the funds to a low risk investment...	2003-06-27

Books	5	4	7	N	Y	This works best for me!!!	I have tried this WOE, and I enjoy it. I have purchased several of her books and made some of the receips. I have better digestion and less gas. After reading several reviews both here and on Ms Somer's website, I came to realized that since we are individuals so should our diet be.the concept of food combining is not new. And Ms. Somers concept is not completely food combining I was looking to elimiated sugar from my diet as much as possible. I need to loose a lot of weight and I have lost some. I had a physcial about 3 weeks go and the doctor was really impressed. The funny thing is I am simply replacing food items with better choice. I have shredded wheat w/bran instead of captain crunch. I have a sugarless bread with fat-free cream cheese instead of wonder bread. I replaced white rice with wild rice. I steam instead of boil. I have eliminated \\"junk food\\" however I went back to eat some and I really didn't like it. I might be doing the program incorrectly However, I am loosing slowing and having more energy.	2003-05-15

I have lost 5 1/2 lbs since beginning this program and this is with little cheats...(I am hoping for a cheat-free April)..... I have begun my exercise program;using the Firm & Leslie Sansone... but more importantly.... I am eating good foods, with less gas, and better digestion... I will admit it is important to have a lot of ingredients on hand, but she is just marketing food combining... so far so good..... I have purchased some of her products but for the most part I have become the \\"SUGAR\\" police and I eat a lot of low-glycemic fruits......, veggies and grains... More than the weight I just feel better... full and better.....	2003-04-01

I re-read this book and read some of her other books... So far I haven't lost any weight however... I am not bloated and I don't feel like I am going to explode from all the gas.... I will admit that I will give another review after I have done this program to the fullest, however at this point I will say that I know my body and with the information in this book I will be able to appreciate it even more... I have purchased some of her products but I do make better decisions at the supermarket and resturants... I don't think I will be a stickler but I will try to do the program as best that I can....

I am reading them backwards this is unfortune. However I will probably purchase her new book on HSN because they are offering it with a video for a low price. I am a sugar junkie and I really need to be detox. I read this book and her Cheat and lose weight book too. Today I will be going to the library to see if I can get the first in the series. What I like about this system is I understand the concept. What I don't like is how to implement it into my life. I am very busy and time is scarce. I did go into the health food store and I fought some of the products like the pastas and the sugar-less cereal and I went on line and purchased the somer-sweet(not mentioned in this book she was still developing it ) So I wrote down what I should and shouldn't have and how to eat the fruits and I am going to honestly give it a try... I will say that in the past when I didn't eat as much sugary things I didn't have mood swings or anxiety attacks and athough I have alot of weight to loose my goal is more of let's just get the sugar out of the diet... I won't be doing this to the exact letter.... but I am going to try it as best that I can.....	2003-01-27

I understand the concept and I think Ms. Sommers helps to clarify it even better. There is good fat/there is bad fat but sugar isn't good for us. Diabetes runs in my family and I am trying to cut if off before it begins with me. I think the only reason I haven't begun this program is because I have been so brainwashed by this society; (one I might add that is extremely overweight and promotes surgery for weightloss) to believe that I have to eat a certain way. I actually found some of the products she mentions in a whole food store. I have ordered her sommersweet from her website. I think I am going to committe to 7 days  of eating in this matter. I have to loose weight but my objective at this moment is to  get the sugar out of my diet as much as possible. I would like to feel less stuffed.	2003-01-21

To begin with the women in this story were educated so why did they speak as though weren't.(\\"We friends\\")things of that nature. I can understand their relationships but it's amazing how birds of a feather stick together and emotionally they were all shot. The sad truth is that so many woman(of all races) don't really love themselves enough.Self-hate becomes the norm and it is obvious in the men and women relationships that are choosen. I digress, this story has been told more than once. However, the main issues are address.... self-love/hate. The need to be and give love to one another. And often the pain of being a minorty woman. This is my third book by this Author the next ones will come from the library as opposed to the bookstore I am just satisfied with myself for waiting for the paperback...	2002-11-07

I am getting used to books with an incredible amount of detail and this one really didn't have it. I believe that the story was based upon factual accounts of Mr. Goines life. It was tragic because the character could not liberate themselves. I have read one other of his books in the past and perhaps I will start with his first book and read all of them. This one was okay.	2002-10-08

However it is not for everyone. Personally I read books to gain as much knowledge about a subject as I possible can. There are some good points in here. However, I &quot;personally&quot; disagree with some of the advice given.  On Pg 70 the author suggests &quot;If ice cream is your weak spot choose low-fat,not low sugar versions. If you want to pig out now and again-it's much better to do it on jelly beans and hard candies rather than chocolate and potatoe chips.&quot; I understand that sugar gives energy but for low blood sugar folks and diabetics this isn't really good advice. I personally feel like I am going to pass out when I eat any of that stuff, but I a feel full and okay when I eat a piece of cheese, meat, some salad, or an egg. I have 2 other books in this series but I think I will be previewing any other books in this series in the library (it needs my support anyway) first before purchasing any more	2002-10-02

I wanted to have a better understanding of the term &quot;UNCLE TOM&quot; which is used so freely in my culture. I have mixed feelings about this book. Notabley, the time in which it was written and the message the author is trying to convey. I will say that I have a better understanding of life for the slaves and their owner back then. I have even seen some comparative situations in this day in age. I don't know if I would recommend this book to anyone, I would suggest to the next reader to prepared to understand the dialect of the characters. Be prepared to open the mind to receive what the auther is trying to express. I am 75% through the book and I still have a lot to digest.	2002-09-18

I have an appreciated for this now more than ever. I am working on this farm as we speak. However, I am fortune enough to realize it and will be making my departure very soon. It is unfortune but very common that the oppress often become the oppressors... as with the management on my current platform. However, I have learned a great deal. I have also created an understanding that education is the key. Ignorance and fear of the unknown blocks individual true potential. Often it is when it is to late.	2002-08-02

The Leonie is annoying and Rolfe he is blind... but as an english teacher once stated when it come to these types of things that is what makes up a book..... or there would be no plot to write. I originally gave this 4 stars, (you have to work really hard for 5 stars with me) But as I sat at my desk at work sneaking a paragragh or two I realized I still enjoy this book.

I can tell you I am not overly impressed. I have read better (I love Lindsey). The author was able to keep my attention because I was hoping the next page would show a difference between the two main characters. There isn't alot of sexual situations in this book...

This book has a lot of symbolism and should be reader with that in mind if not them the read will have a difficult time getting it. I understand why this has become a classic.

I liked it because it helped me be okay with my struggles. The woman in the story, for me personally came off as to desparate. In my hardest times I have seen many(Ate greens for a month)I was not that desparate... I didn't like it because Carol-Anne was in too much of a need. A need to take care of her child, her home.And Max was her Savior.. A spouse or mate should not be a savior but a help meet for someone. She slept with rats.. Didn't want to take the father to court but slept with him... Couldn't get christmas presents... Christmas is the same date every year. So why not by a little through out the year.When she was with Max he was footing the bill, that would have been a goodtime to put a little aside....Also,she could have gotten a temp job for 3or 4 months or worked on the weekends.. I realize that this is just a novel and as my English teacher would say with out all of that there would be not plot... As a woman writer, I would thing that showing the struggle along with the determination would have been a better angle.. I am not for the superwoman game either but dag...
