Everest Disaster	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Excellent first-hand account of this disaster	This book is very well written by Jon Krakauer, who was one of the  climbers of Everest when this disaster took place. Though at times, as Jon  will say many times, his memory was &quot;fuzy&quot; due to the extreme  cold and lack of oxygen, he tells to the best of his recollection the  amazing story that he was in the middle of. In 1996, Jon was asked by a  magazine he writes for to be part of an expedition to climb to the summit  of the worlds highest peak. The cost, over $65,000, was completely paid for  by this magazine. Jon, a regular climber, always dreamed of this challenge  and here was his chance. He would be part of a team with some world-class  climbers. This is the story of a good plan and how it fell apart. Many  people died in May of 1996, some survived, due to luck. Even experience  couldn't gaurentee a safe ascent and decline. Rob Hall and Scott Fischer  were two of the best. They both died. Many people have criticized the  &quot;guided tours&quot; business, arguing that many people who have no  right to make this amazing feat have paid their way to the top. Many people  died who shouldn't have been on the mountain in the first place. This book  takes you through the hard times and triumphs, but it explores more. It  tells of the &quot;slave wages&quot; paid to the Sherpas, who are like  mules, just human. It tells of people with money thinking, maybe knowing,  they can buy anything. It tells of people with dreams and goals, like the  mailman who saved for years to do this. This book is written like A Perfect  Storm, by Sebastian Junger, in the sense that it explores the history and  lives of the &quot;characters&quot;. This is a great book and I'm glad I  read it.	2000-09-06
US	52891806	R332QHPLC6CGOG	0446608483	835067122	The Pledge	Books	5	6	8	N	N	GREAT BOOK	This book is quite possibly the best novel I have read this year and I read a lot. Rob Kean should be praised for his debut work. This novel has  many pages, which some consider a fault, but it reads so fast. The story  begins with the mysterious death of a Pledge, hence the title, at a rich,  powerful and shady Frat house. This fraternity will do anything in it's  power to conceal the truth, and they do have the resources at their  fingertips!  This is a story of money, power, greed, love, and the author  combines them so well. The characters are deep and you will feel for them.  You get to know them and how they think. Mark Jessy is the Super hero, a  mysterious, yet intelligent young man with a complicated past. Shawn Jakes  is the beautiful, extremely intelligent, motivated star. There are so many  well developed characters. The Dean is a interesting person, to say the  least. The frat brothers are muscular, brainy, good looking and Dangerous.  My favorite, of course, is the former Marine who will crush anyone who  crosses his path. The freshman Pledges are so perfectly portrayed. This  book will make you cry, be happy, smile and imagine the possibility of this  really happening. You won't be able to put it down. I can't wait to read  his next book, which I hope is on the horizon. The movie, which he was  reportedly advanced $1,000,000 for the rights, should be spectacular.  Critics have also stated that the events in this book are farfetched, they  must have not noticed the words FICTION in the cover. Enjoy this book, I  did.	2000-08-23

It brings many social issues into the story, such as teachers effects on their students. It also combines the &quot;hate USA&quot; and Arab terrorism to make for a  great story. This is the first book I have read by the author and I am very  impressed. He is able to combine a few different plots together to create  the whole picture. The characters are described in such great detail, you  will have an excellent mental picture.	2000-06-29

This book tells the effects of having women in positions that they are not &quot;up to  par&quot;. There are many women that can and do compete with their male  counterparts, but most just don't match up. This book asks the questions-  Are we ready for war? Will we win? As a US Marine, I have witnessed the  difference in training the women are subjected to. Not only are the  standards lower, they ARE treated differently, given more chances. I am a  Fire Fighter in the Marines and I have personally witnessed the  &quot;gentler&quot; way they are treated. They do have to complete the same  objectives, but with more time and coaxing. This book is a real eye opener  to anyone interested in the state of the military today. The fact that this  book is written by a CIVILIAN WOMAN, makes it even more credible.	2000-06-29

This book tells of the struggle of families during war and the complicated decisions that need to be made. It is also the story of a  father and his son. The main character played by Mel Gibson reluctantly  goes off to war. His son also enlists against his fathers wishes. He then  asks that his son be transferred to his company so he can keep an eye on  him. This book is full of battle, which I can't wait to see on the big  screen. It's not a difficult book to read and you will finish it in a few  sittings. I read it in one night.	2000-06-27

I started with the first book, Left Behind, which is what I recommend you do. It helps to build on the characters and the plot  if you understand what was previously written. Of all seven this is my  second favorite, Assassins being the first. This book is action packed and  will certainly make you think about what is &quot;out there&quot;.

This novel is so well written, it was an instant bestseller. It  explains to the non-fishing type, like myself, about the dangers of the  trade and what it takes to be a successful fisherman. It does so in a way  to spark your interest. His style of retelling boating horror stories of  the past that encountered &quot;amazing&quot; storms adds to the thrill and  understanding of this book. All this with the action packed true story make  it a book not to be missed. This book is tough to put down, especially in  the middle when it really starts to get &quot;involved&quot;. I would  definitely recommend this book.	2000-06-19

It is good to know that it was researched entensively before being written, but a little too much left in the book.

It digs into his childhood and his role models, mainly his grandfather and father, both Naval officers. He knew at a young age he was destined for military, even with  difficulties in the Naval Academy and doing poorly there, he still went on  to excell. He tells of his experiences as a POW and other war stories. I am  not a fan of political books, but this is more than that. He is an  exceptional person and this is more than a McCain For President  advertisement. This is highly receommended. From reading this book I am  impresses with him and think the Senator is one of the good guys.	2000-06-13

This book represents their stories. It tells the story of America and the people who's lives were forever changed by Front-page-story events.  It is the story of despair and success, triumph and defeat, women and  minorities fighting for their causes, soldiers and Marines, and of ordinary  people who found themselves in extraordinary circumstances.

This tells the story that infuriated so many Americans back in 1993, when an American pilot was dragged through the streets of Somalia on TV. This  was the pilot of the crashed Black Hawk helicopter. This story is so well  written and I would gladly read anything else Bowden writes. This also  tells of the extreme odds the soldiers faced against the paople of Somalia.  Even civilians had weapons and were shooting at the soldiers. The American  forces were grossly outnumbered. This book is one of the best I have read  and I am certainly recommending it.	2000-06-13
