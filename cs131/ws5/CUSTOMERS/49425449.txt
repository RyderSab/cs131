So, I purchased this book because I was so pleased with the other 2. This is excellent. If you wish to build a control - he covers both client and ASP.NET. And if you have a really good idea for a control, he goes into several advanced licensing techniques. Probably my favorite chapter is on encryption.  I can see why Microsoft wanted Mr Connell to write another book. He has a keen sense of knowing what readers want and can explain his thoughts with crystal clearity.	2004-05-31

While encryption is the up and coming area, I never realized you could do something this sophisticated. It's easy to see how this nifty control can be added to many of my programs. And the technique of hashing a key from a PW is elegant. Also, the concept of Isolated Storage was presented and covered in depth - another area that was new to me. The book is loaded with useful tips such as something I always wondered about - why do my VB forms and controls look flat on XP, when my browser and other programs sport the XP colorful look? All that is missing is a simple manifest and property settings. Cool. I was also impressed with the wireless and pocketPC programming. Oh, and then there is the advanced datagrid which shows how to make that sing. I wish the book were twice the size. Good stuff - I read it cover to cover in less than three days.	2003-10-24

This book is a refreshing change. Mr. Connell covers encryption with a handy control to encrypt your important files so that even governments can't crack them, let alone snooping co-workers. But he covers isolated storage, the control designer, custom designers, designer verbs, type editors, type converters, and other topics you just don't find elsewhere. Other topics such as serialization, control licensing, the advanced use of the ASP.NET datagrid, and of course building sophisticated controls for both the desktop and the web are well done. This book treads new and exciting ground, so you won't have to worry about not learning new concepts. There is fresh and incredibly useful material in each chapter. Even if you are not building controls today, this book will help you be a better all-round programmer in so many ways.  I've read Mr. Connell's other books and enjoyed them - this was not a disappointment and for me worth the wait.	2003-10-16

While the other .Net books (and Ive read several for the past yr including C#) tend to repeat or say the same things in a differnet way - Connell sheds new light on .Net for the professional developer. For example, he discusses how to find things in the Framework using WinCV. Or not to use a short int (16 bit) because its actually slower because of current 32 bit CPU registers. Or how to use Option correctly. Or how to use .Net error messages to help find the data type you need. While this might not be a beginners first .Net book, clearly everyone will learn techniques and how to find your way around the framework. Oh, and it's simply the best explaination of ADO.NET and ASP.NET around. All in all, if you have to purchase one book - this is it. My copy is dog eared. There is even a cool .Net Artificial Intelligence program used to illustrate key concepts. And a Magic 8 Ball Web Service that I got up and running - and completely understand that new concept. It's not only well written and informative - but very fun to read. I hope Mr. Connell comes up with another .Net book soon.	2002-11-12

It's sort of a roll of the dice, but I was extremely impressed. I was a bit aprehensive about learning VB.Net but am now an advocate. This book shows how easy and powerful the framework is. Better yet - the framework is explained (how to find things, how to use it, etc.) in the clearest terms possible. IF you are a developer moving from classic VB you just can't go wrong here.	2002-08-29

Most of them are me-too and a rehash of documentation. I saw this in a well known book store, paged through it, and purchased it on line. Mr. Connell's book is different in that he leads the reader through each chapter to show how each builds on the next using crafted code. Armed with what you just learned, you move to the next area - building on the previous knowledge.   For example, he starts with Object Orientation -&gt; Data Types -&gt; Class Framework -&gt; Error Handling -&gt; Assemblies -&gt; Windows Services -&gt; ADO -&gt; Datasets -&gt; ASP -&gt; Web Services -&gt; Virtual Inheritance, etc. I have recommended this to my friends.

I manage a techincal group just getting started with .Net.  While I have literally over a hundred technical programming books, I have never written a review before. The publisher got my money in exchange for some knowledge so I never found a need to take the time to write a review before - good or bad. But this book stands out in so many ways. I read it in four days and found myself returning to chapters on ADO.NET, Web Services, architecture, etc. I agree with the other reviewers giving this book 5 stars. If you want to not only learn VB.Net but understand it as well, I highly recommend Connels book. In fact, I just ordered the authors database book. This guy is good.	2002-05-25

Some areas are covered more in depth than others, but this contains the best explaination of object oriented programming to the VB'er that I've ever seen. The expansive framework is then examined showing clearly how to find and use this powerful tool. File IO and Web Services are also very nicely covered, with a full 3 chapters on the new ADO.NET. I think what I like most is that it's clear this book was layed out in an expert fashion. Each chapt builds on the next, and before I knew it VB.Net seemed like an old friend. The writing style is crisp, and ancellary pieces of info are presented to show how each new element of .Net not only fits into the whole, but how each is used in real world examples. He provides gems such as why never to use the new short integer (16 bit) because the cpu registers are 32 bit. Most professional programmers automatically try to use the smallest data type for the job, but in this case selecting a short would actually add cycles to pad the other 16 bits. I have not seen pro tips like this anywhere else. I did read Connell's previous database book (which is dog eared on my shelf), and was also pleasantly surprised with this one.  This is the first review I have ever written for any book - but felt this book stands above the other .Net books I've read so would take the time.	2002-05-03

This book takes you through OO, deriving classes, new data types and tips, managing collections and arrays, covers new (for VB) structured error handling and debugging, deploying pubic and private assemblies, ADO.NET and ASP.NET and WEb Services. Each chapter builds on the next, so the reader can easily see how the pieces fit together. The fairly complete coverage of ADO.NET (3 chapters) shows how to deploy disconnected recordsets. Next, Connell moves into ASP.NET and shows how to use what was just learned in ASP - very logical progression. There is some good coverage of file management, logical and visual inheritance, and XML. In the final chapter, a desktop app (Sticky Yellow Note) is built using OO, static procedures, context menues, filestreams, and XML. Then the app is deployed - you can give this to people that don't have the .NEt framework installed yet. All in all, a very conprehensive and readable book. I found this useful. I think if you are already proficient in VB or C++ you will really enjoy this.	2002-03-19

Another reviewer of this book got my attention when he said the 286 happened in the 90's and not the 80's as the book claims. I'm old enough and seem to remember it in the 80's as well - a quick google search showed the 80286 released on Feb 1982 - 16 bits running at 12 mhz. Anyway, if a critique is going to be made, in my opinion it should be accurate. <br />There is just too many not-so-good-quickly rushed to market books on the shelves. As a 20 yr programmer, I would recommend this as an excellent read. I've read several .Net books on both C# and VB - so far this is the best I've found.	2002-03-05

I completely agree with the other reviewers. John Connell leads the reader through .Net in such a clear and enjoyable way that you don't realize just how much you learned. After finishing a chapter, I close the book and reflect on all the ground that has been covered. The book logically leads the reader through assemblies, interned strings, structured error handling (i.e., try, catch, finally), classes, how to understand and quickly use the massive framework, OOP techniques, Web Services, Windows Services, ASP.NET, ADO.NET, XML, disconnected datasets, and much more. For me, these were pretty much completely new concepts - yet this book makes them crystal clear. I wish more books could be writting with this style of clearity and razer sharp examples. If you are trying to learn VB.Net, in my humble opinion you just can't go wrong with this book.	2002-03-01

I've been programming in VB from version 3 through 6 and really haven't done much with objects, so was a bit concerned about learning VB.Net (where everything is an object). I had difficulty with C++ in this regard. I just received Coding Techniques for VB.Net and can't put it down. While the book provides all sorts of expert techniques, it conveys the information in a clear and easy to follow manner.  After two days I've already built several .Net programs and have all sorts of ideas for many more. The section on Artifical Intelligence using the .Net Eliza program is fantastic. The ADO.Net and Web Services sections are just plain fun to read. I highly recommend this Microsoft book.	2001-12-20

Now, when I browse books its hard to find one that gives me new information. Connell's book give me new information and techniques on just about every page. Mr. Connell is a pro and it shows that he has written tight and production quality code. In fact, the thead through the book is bullet proof UIs. I can see why many college level courses use Mr. Connell's book as the main text, as well as some VB certification classes. It's outstanding. As many other reviewers have asked - please Mr. Connell, write another book!	2001-09-27

When I read the reviews on Amazon, I found it no less than amazing that over 160 programmers took the time to review a book. I read each of the reviews and then purchased Connell's book. After reading it cover to cover, I can see what the hoopla is about. Starting from page 1, this text is filled with common sense programming gems that go far beyond dataase programming. Of course, this book covers everything you need to know for developing first rate DB progs quickly and painlessly. But I for one also learned how to build bullet proof UI's and some very elegant optimization techniques Im using in all my programs. This book contains information you just don't find in any other programming books. So Im taking a minute to add my 2 cents to the already volumonous list of praise for Connell's book. If you are a programmer, you will learn something useful from this book. If you are programming data bases, this book is a home run.	2001-03-23

First, Im completely amazed that so many people would actually review a *technical* book. But now I see why. This book is the best programming (not only VB) book Ive ever read.

So I  checked out the Amazon reviews and saw that most others feel the same way -  well I just had to write a review. If you are looking for a single source  of tips and sugestions, clear concepts, and how to write bullet proof ui's  - this is THE book.

It's always difficult job to get the cirruculum book selection committee to approve of a new text. The other CS teacher and I selected and recommended Dr.  Connell's book after rigerous due dilligence. We examined every other VB  book on the market. Interestingly enough, we both came to the same  conclusion and each independantly selected this book! It was ultimately  approved by the committee last year and we both used the text. After full  semester classes by both myself and the other instructor - we compared  notes and were very pleasantly surprised at the student responses.  Typically students are luke warm about the textbook used in class. However,  this book got them excited to learn and it was universally ranked as number  one. Anyway - I intend to use this book again next semester. If you want a  profesisonal, easy to read, packed with informaton book - I recommend Dr.  Connell's database book.	2000-08-01

Not only does Connell cover db design, normalization, cursors, connections, and  the ADO Object Model,  butI found helpful code and professional insights on  user interfaces, ActiveX controls, web design, DAO, DLLs, SQL, automation,  and much more. Mr. Connell weaves these terms with precision and clearity  like no one I've read. So, for what it's worth, I highly recommend this.  After reading this particular book, I really feed that the light has come  on. All of these disparate technologies have been elegantly tied together  so even I can understand them.

I can say that I am not surprised. As a  professional developer manager and hands on coder, I can tell you that this  is the best technical book I have - and not limited to databases. There is  so much in this book above and beyond what I expected that I refer to it as  a reference guide. I also 'recommended' that my team read the book as well.  It not only covers ADO/DAO/ADO_OLE databases, but how to think about  developing applictions. The section on user interfaces alone was worth the  price to me. I'm getting on the waiting list for any book Mr. Connell  decides to write.  :-)	2000-07-02

Mr. Connell had the foresite to comment that even though MS said DAO was dead - he felt MS would have to keep it. Well, it turns out he was right on the money. Office 2000 uses DAO  and Mr. Connell's book is the best I've found for programming the office  suite. Not only is he an excellent writer and teacher, he has a pretty good  crystal ball.  I find myself rereading sections and shaking my head at how  easy he has made much previously incomprehensible material. I want to find  out where he teaches so I can sign up for a class or two.
