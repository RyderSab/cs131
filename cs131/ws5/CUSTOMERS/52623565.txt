US	52623565	R212MT9NM8SWP4	0451186362	40528119	Rose Madder	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Good King	<br />Rose Madder is part of a group of King books I had yet not read.  Well, I'm glad I did. Like his best efforts, it is character driven. And in Rose Daniels/McClendon King supplies one of the best characters in all the books I've read by him.  On the dark side of things, her abusive husband is one of his darkest villains.  What makes both so interesting is that they are also complex.  Rose, whose innocence covers a core of rage; and Norman, who for all of his brutality, is ultimately pathetic.  What King offers up is not a black and white universe.  And of course there is a whole slew of lesser but well drawn characters that propel the story along.   <br /> <br />As a novel, the plotting is pretty good.  However, somewhere around page 400 I thought, from a pacing point of view, King should of wrapped things up.  But that would of left out Norman's horrible Bacchae-like fate (which practically has you feeling sorry for him - some things Are worse than death), and an ending that did seem, though strangely cryptic, right.  Some padding, but not nearly enough to give me Tommyknocker nightmares. <br /> <br />There is mention here from others about King's Dark Tower series, and the symbolism King employs in \\"Rose Madder.\\"  Since I have not read those books, I can't comment on how effectively that works.  I am aware of King's statements regarding how he is trying to tie much of his work together in such a way it relates to the Dark Tower series.  To some extent I think this is (in a number of cases) an after the fact effort by King - and a mistake.  Whatever.  By itself, the symbolism of \\"Rose Madder\\" Is somewhat confusing, but I think the real-world rooting of the story helps the reader skate over these areas fairly lightly, with entertainment trumping confusion.  \\"Madder\\" does veer from a dark fairy tale beginning, into Greek mythology, and closes with what some might consider a Christian allegory.  Basically, wrath is a deadly sin, and Norman's fate is linked to that fact.  Rose herself is warned of her own susceptibility to anger - even if it is well justified.  Rose's remembrance of the \\"tree\\" is simply a need to bury the past.  Read tree here as \\"cross,\\" but in a way that supercedes the earlier mythological meaning (King getting deep here).  Otherwise, \\"Madder\\" will become madness, as the spider goddess (clearly Diana) warns Rose.   Underscoring this Christian take on \\"Madder,\\" is the goddess being restrained by Dorcas (see the New Testament).   Good stuff, with King (successfully) stretching himself, while still operating within genre.  Not an easy thing to do.	2005-09-24
US	52623565	R49ZV6Y3PW8W8	0140107479	292088234	The Transit of Venus	Books	3	32	37	N	N	Uneven effort	I was torn as to how to rate Shirley Hazzard's \\"Transit of Venus.\\"  Hazzard is an enormously gifted writer.  But the novel itself had me asking the question: when does a great writer become a great artist?  It's a fine distinction that one doesn't come across often, since such things unfold on their own.  The discerning reader simply knows when they've read a great piece of literature. But Hazzard's own ambition here had me asking that very question.  In other words, one gets the sense that Hazzard, in \\"The Transit of Venus,\\" set out to write a great novel.  There are certainly numerous stretches of great writing - but as a novel, I felt its Jamesian excesses turned the reading into something of an ordeal by book's end.  In fairness, I think I prefer Hazzard to James in that she writes of Love in a more believable way - and I'm talking of Love as in Shakespeare or Donne.  (And stuff actually happens!) People certainly don't talk like Hazzard has them talk - but any lover of language has to wish that they did. Hazzard writes prose that is better than most contemporary poetry.  And boy, can she frame a scene, like placing actors on a stage - and with good lines!  But such staginess is risky, and in long novel it can wear.  Some of Hazzard's side stories, such as Christian's affair, or his wife Grace's near-affair, could have been trimmed. Also, the \\"political\\" insertions sounded just like that - insertions, or recollections of old anti-American table talk with Hazzard's good friend Graham Greene. Then there's the sense of time - it comes and goes.  Yes, I get a sense of the fifties, but not so much the sixties or later. Such historical convulsions should of made more of a reading impression. In all it makes for an uneven reading effort - which is odd, given the precision of Hazzard's writing and plotting.  But the good news is that Hazzard has written a great novel - it's called \\"The Great Fire.\\"	2005-09-11
US	52623565	R1M1TFZUEF4PWE	0690012322	451302838	Gods and Beasts: The Nazis and the Occult	Books	5	13	14	N	N	Important and chilling book on contemporary Groupthink	<br />About halfway through Dusty Sklar's \\"The Nazi's and the Occult,\\" (the title of the Dorset Press version I read) I did some research on just who is or was Dusty Sklar.  I pretty much drew a blank.  But I did run across a story from back in the late 70s that showed she was sued by the Unification Church (Moonies) over her portrayal of them in the book.  This itself was interesting, since this portrayal doesn't occur until the last 10 pages.  But the Moon quotes Sklar provides are pretty damning.  The case was dismissed. <br /> <br />One of the reasons I went searching for Sklar, was because her book is so well-written.  I was expecting some sort of evangelical treatment on the satanic Nazis, and what I got was a carefully written effort that is all the more chilling because of its restraint. One weakness in the book is Sklar's reliance on Ravenscroft's \\"Spear of Destiny.\\"  But to some extent this is understandable, since Sklar points out, the occult and its followers and participants, shrouds itself, by its very nature, in secrecy.  Still, if you have problems with Ravenscroft's very odd take, there is still plenty to seize upon in Sklar's presentation to leave you with little doubt as to Nazi involvement with the occult.  And this is further buttressed by the Allies wartime monitoring of Nazi occult interests.  Even more effective are the numerous quotes from average Germans remembering what it was like to live in Hitler's Germany (\\"We Germans are so happy.  We are free of freedom.\\").  One particular nugget: how the German literacy rate had declined on the eve of war - something Hitler wanted, since he disparaged universal education as an impediment to people being useful cogs in his machine.  Do not think - but obey!  <br /> <br />What was on Hitler's reading shelf (as was recorded in the Library of Congress)?  Or who were the mystic (and racist) nuts he hung out with in the early days before his rise to power (and what did they think - and write)?  Or his suicide - on the Feast of Beltrane (an important date on the Satanic calender).  The origin of the Swastika.  All in all, Sklar's research is impressive - and more, since she is really looking beyond the Nazi phenomenon to our own times.  I couldn't help but be reminded of the opening of Don Delillo's \\"Mao II,\\" with its mass Moonie wedding in Yankee Stadium - and its coda: The Future Belongs to Crowds.  It's a shame Ms. Sklar has not followed up this effort with a new edition, but her point/warning still holds: that the Nazi party \\"arose out of the merger of mystical groups..\\"  In other words, there are dragons among us, even now. <br /> <br />	2005-05-22
US	52623565	RFXI79DE2CRH4	0425182894	912786438	Gunman's Rhapsody	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Parker's Tombstone	<br />After finishing this book, I could see where fans of the movie might call this an accompaniment. It certainly tracks that popular movie, nevertheless I feel this in indeed Parker's take, and not some ripoff.  \\"Tombstone\\" fans need to keep in mind that the war in Tombstone between the Earps and the \\"cowboys\\" are about as Americana as stories of the James brothers or John Dillinger.  In other words, it has been told a zillion times.  That said, I feel Parker's version has its own freshness to it - which no mean accomplishment. The style of the book has the clipped economy of an early Leonard western (\\"Valdez is Coming,\\" \\"Hombre\\").  The Wyatt Earp of \\"Gunman's Rhapsody,\\" for at least two thirds of the novel, is a man with a hole in him.  Basically, he's a killing machine, a character who hugs his coffee ( a distinct advantage in a landscape full of whiskey drinkers), who studies the activity in rooms as well as the mechanics of accurate shooting . He's also manipulative enough to stage or force, on his terms, what he feels will be an inevitable fight.  In other words, he's very cagey.  But aside from that, there's his growing love for Josie Marcus, who would later become his wife.  However slowly, this relationship is forcing a change in Wyatt, filling that \\"hole.\\"  To some extent this makes him more ruthless, in that he now has something to fight for (earlier in the novel, his encounter with a gunman shows a man who just doesn't care whether he lives or dies - which is also an advantage). <br /> <br />The other famous characters, Bat Masterson, Doc Holliday, the other Earp brothers, John Ringo, etc., are all worked into the novel, without any sense of name dropping.  (Parker's take on Ringo's mysterious death is not one I've heard before.)  Less effective is Parker's insertion of \\"newsclippings\\" (see Dos Passos \\"Camera Eye\\" sections in \\"U.S.A\\"), which is, I think, a mistake.  It's an old device, that usually works, since it allows for a pause in the narrative flow.  But given the clipped tone of the novel, or perhaps Parker's own seemingly arbitrary selection, this device doesn't seem to work.  No real sense of the \\"march of time\\" really takes place.  They just seem annoying.  One other weakness is the last quarter of the book: the conversations between Josie and Wyatt.  They devolve into a kind of stilted Mamet-speak, without the movie visuals.  I get more a sense for their real love for each other in the novel's epilogue, which shows that they did indeed live a long life together.  But this is an action novel, and not a love story, and from that perspective, it largely works.  One feels you are in the hands of a Pro.  Kudos to Parker!	2005-03-13
US	52623565	RAZQ2S1AH9J60	0440158079	517600418	The Moonshine War	Books	5	17	17	N	N	Grade A  Leonard	\\"The Moonshine War,\\" is Grade-A Leonard.  Written in 1969, one could say it was written at a time when Leonard was still a wonderful secret, and not yet a trendy discovery for People Magazine.  What makes \\"The Moonshine War\\" a bit different than some of Leonard's crime novels, is that it is set in the not too distant past - 1931.  So to some extent it is a historical novel. The setting is Eastern Kentucky. True,  Leonard skates pretty lightly over the regional specifics (dialect, land descriptions, etc.) - the kind of things that make Faulkner or Cormac McCarthy so authentic in a literary sense.  But Leonard does throw enough in to make it thriller believable.  Authentic details regarding the making of moonshine, historical nods, such as the Spanish flu, WW 1, and the kind of overalls men wore, for the most part root the reader well enough.  The characters are as solid as any Leonard has created. Son Martin, the novel's hero, is your typical Leonard tough-guy.  Quiet, operating on the edge of things, something of an outlaw himself.  The bad guys are what you would expect.  Vicious, erratic, and often kind of stupid.  Of particular note, however, is Dr. Taulbee, a murderous bootlegger, who is smarter than your average Leonard criminal, and a difficult opponent for Son Martin.  But he has a weak spot - Miley, a beautiful (and amoral) prostitute, who's along for the ride, though she's always looking for a reliable man.  Son, with his internal code of honor, is closer to fitting that description than the good doctor, and Miley, who recognized this, is in her own way a more admirable character than Mrs. Lyons, Son's long-running love interest from town. <br /> <br />The plot in \\"The Moonshine War,\\" is pretty simple: bootleggers trying to steal Son's hidden whiskey, and Son's reluctance to let that happen.  There are echoes of \\"High Noon,\\" as Son's friends and neighbors abandon him to the bootleggers.  One questions whether mountain folks would abandon one of their own toan assault from outsiders, but Leonard seems to anticipate this, when he has a neighbor of Son's tell him that the difference in their predicament is that Son has no family being threatened.  In essence, to what extent Son cares for his neighbors is thus returned, in kind, which makes the ending appropriate, and well done.  Leonard's endings can sometimes be disappointing.  I have remarked on this myself (\\"52 Pickup\\").  But my complaint had more to do with the fireworks leading up to the end of that novel.  If you look at the range of Leonard's work, you see an author who likes the open ended ending.  It is a deliberate artistic choice by Leonard. At his best (for example, \\"Valdez is Coming,\\" \\"City Primeval\\") he leaves the reader with a vivid, even mythic, tableau that invites the reader in. Leonard loves his High Noon moments, and will often freeze it, in novel after novel, like a photograph of opponents squared away on Main Street, guns drawn, with the sun beating down.  \\"The Moonshine War,\\" to my mind sits up there with the best of Leonard.   <br /> <br />	2005-01-31

So, not having read him before,  I was quite surprised at the effectiveness of his argument(s) in \\"The Catholic Church, A Short History.\\"  The title is somewhat misleading.  Yes, church history is discussed, and Kung's grasp of that history is amazing.  But this little book - 200 pages or so - is a diamond sharp assault on the papacy as it currently exists.  And the bull's eye - is Infallibility. (Though other questionable doctrines, such as the Immaculate Conception, are also discussed.) After reading Kung's argument, and earlier, Garry Wills' \\"Papal Sins,\\" I come away thinking there is simply no intellectual, or spiritual, leg on which to support this doctrine.  To support it is to deny having a brain, and arguably, a soul. A good exercise after reading both books would be to run to the \\"Brothers Karamazov\\", and read \\"The Grand Inquisitor\\" chapter.  Dostoevksy could see through the murk of argument, to the spiritual heart of the matter. With the insistence on infallibility, there can be no Christ, in fact, it insures ultimately, a rejection of Christ.  <br /> <br />Wills' book however focuses on the historical efforts of Pius IX to put this doctrine in place - as well as those who fought against it.  What Kung does is to trace this development, in stunning economy backed up with fact, all the way back to the eleventh century.  For example, Kung's discussion regarding the Medieval use of forgeries to cement the notion of Roman primacy is particularly revealing.  Kung does point out, however, that this chain did not necessarily have to lead to this doctrine.  Choices still have to be made - unfortunately, historically most of them have been the wrong ones.  But there is, according to Kung, hope, and he sees it in the improbable papacy of John XXIII.  John's run was short, but it did set in motion Vatican II.  But since then, the door for change has been shut again under John Paul II.   Personally, I'm less hopeful than Kung regarding the future of the institutional Church.  The elevation of groups like Opus Dei, the questionable saint making (Pius IX & Pius XII (Hitler's pope)), the reaction to the pedophile scandals,  show an office that will do anything to hold onto authority.  You cannot defend lies and proclaim yourself the Church of Christ.	2004-10-16

A new place in the country, a new girl, maybe a hobby like wine tasting, and things will start to right themselves.  But you shouldn't trust the speaker, he's not to be trusted, since he doesn't even know himself.  Jason Starr's dandy little noir, \\"Twisted City,\\" is probably the closest thing I've read to a Jim Thompson novel yet.  A short time back, I ran across a similarly impressive Thompson-like effort in Andrew Vachss's \\"The Getaway Man.\\"  The one distinction there however, was the voice of Eddie, criminal that he is, also something of a sweet victim.  You don't see many of those in Thompson land.  And it is in that sense that Starr is truer to the master.  \\"Twisted City\\" is dark through and through, but leavened with comic (if black) humor and dialogue.   <br /> <br />Miller, the speaker, is on surface a journalist coming off the loss of his sister.  Like so many modern day city types, Miller compartmentalizes his life.  But boy, what he sticks away in those hidden compartments (and wallet)!  And don't push this seemingly rational man too far.  He is capable of messing you up. But pressures are mounting in David's life, all triggered by the loss (theft) of his wallet.  Junkies, blackmailers, a partying girlfriend with a past of her own, you hate to see  Miller pick up the phone or open the door to find out what new curve ball is coming his way.  Suddenly, carefully erected walls start to dissolve, and other realities begin to bleed through .  Miller even starts having conversations with his dead sister Barbara.  The voice here is remarkable, and reminiscent of various leading Thompson characters (Lou Ford from the \\"The Killer Inside Me\\" comes instantly to mind).   One big secret you anticipate right away, but that's not the real surprise. It's the voice - and what it becomes. Kind of like watching a serpent's egg hatch.	2004-08-21

As background for the heist: the 1958 World Series, playing everywhere on radios and tv, while plots are perfected. And in the hills Castro gets closer and closer. This is fascinating stuff, and in many ways serves as a satisfying expansion on the \\"Cuban\\" parts of Godfather II.  <br />  <br /> Latour knows the people, and the times. Dialogue and description blend seamlessly and accurately in prose that is Hemingwayesque in its leaness and precision. Historical figures, such as Lansky and Joe Bonanno, are believably lethal. Fictional characters, such as ringleader Mariano \\"Ox\\" Contreras, are just as believable (and lethal). Cuba was a tough place in 1958, where money and death could be made or found, depending on the breaks and maybe your brains. Honor, deception, sex, violence, baseball, torture, and revolution, it's all here. Good general comparisons (dialogue, description, intricate plotting) could probably be found in George Higgins' \\"The Friends of Eddie Coyle,\\" or his \\"Outlaws.\\" That said, \\"Havana World Series\\" nevertheless stakes out its own impressive turf in the upper reaches of crime fiction, and on its own terms. A classic.	2004-08-03
US	52623565	R15PBWGIAK0WQS	0060083956	843453239	Mr. Paradise	Books	4	1	1	N	N	The Master of Cool	Elmore Leonard's latest, Mr. Paradise, is a fine return to crime-writing form.  Like others, I was not crazy about Pagan Babies, nor did I like Cuba Libre.  Pagan Babies aimed for something beyond the crime-writing genre (Rwanda), while at the same time using crime-writing as the vehicle. A strange failure.  Cuba Libre had some good scenes in it, but it felt like an attempt to revisit the great Leonard Westerns from years back, while lacking those novel's hard hitting economy.  But Tishomengo Blues got my attention back however.  Hip, cool, utterly American in its cast of bad guys, good guys, and yes, girls.  The setting (Miss.), and the event, a Civil War re-enactment, and a hero who is a professional diver.  Great stuff.   <br /> <br />Now comes Mr. Paradise.  Mr. Paradise, with its Detroit setting, its cast of crazies and cops and as usual, super dialogue, is as good as, say, City Primeval.  The only difference is that Leonard is now pushing 80.  It's simply amazing that someone that old can have such a fine ear for the culture.  Music, slang, the Street and what's happening out there.  For example, in one scene, Kelly Barr meets bad guy Montez Taylor to discuss a possible deal.  It unrolls like one cool clip from a film, Kelly/Leonard, zapping Taylor with extensive knowledge of current hip-hop music scene.  Incredible.  Try an envision an 80 year old man bopping to Iggy Pop (he's in here as well). The plot?  Well, there's a lot of murders and hit men, dirty lawyers, the possibility of a big payday, a good looking woman and a lonely cop.  Just take it from there.  The Master.	2004-07-30

He's been given one last chance (read: Redemption) to regain partial custody of his children, by assisting in a shady deal being pushed by sleazy ex \\"business\\" associate, Terry Dahl, who now lives with Shawn's former wife.  The deal involves the raising of the \\"Constance,\\" which has been lying  at the bottom of Lake Tahoe since 1940.  The media (and money) frenzy surrounding this possible event has the allure of an inland \\"Titanic.\\"  But the \\"Constance\\" has secrets buried with her, and the 70-something year old daughter of the owner that scuttled the ship wants to keep it that way.  <br />At its best, \\"Echo Bay\\" deals with the sins of the past and the need to let them go - or risk drowning in the bad mix of new sins and haunted memories.  Thus, as a metaphor, \\"Echo Bay's\\" ship works as a fine McGuffin for all the intrigues to cluster around.  But turning away from the past doesn't mean you can avoid confronting the truth - no matter how old, no matter how deeply buried. Rainey's diggings and conflicts reveal many a hidden skeleton, including a few from his own closet.  Barre's use of dialogue is really what drives this story.  It's tough and spare, often funny, but not in a smart-aleck Carl Hiasson way.  The players here are all playing for keeps.  For the most part it works.  Up until the last 100 pages or so I thought I was reading something special, given the plot and the tough talk, \\"Echo Bay\\" seemed to have struck a balance, and was moving beyond genre, providing the kind of contemporary snapshot that penetrates, through its insights, the culture of a time and place. But for some reason \\"Echo Bay\\" never really establishes the tragic vision of, for example, Lehane's \\"Shutter Island,\\" orRobert Stone's \\"Dog Soldiers.\\"  <BR>By novel's end things get nicely arranged, loose ends are tied up, intriguing characters flatten out into types, and you're already thinking of what next to read.   I can't help but feel this novel opened with higher stakes on the table.  That said, Rainey is a great character and I would definitely read Barre again.  His dialogue is every bit as good as Leonard at his best, and that in itself is reason enough to read on.	2004-07-15

Harvey's one of the rare genre writers - in this case, crime fiction - who transcends genre.  \\"Cold Light\\" in some ways reminds you of Ed McBain's cop novels.  The main story, the tragic disappearance of young woman on Christmas Eve, is told from a variety of viewpoints, with numerous side stories that in the end contribute, rather than detract, from the main story.  Harvey's eye for detail is impressive. \\"Cold Light\\" takes place in the early 90s of Thatcher's England.  What a bleak place and time!  This is underscored immediately, as a young woman crawls out from underneath her sleeping common law husband.  Her life is already sad, even though she's not yet out of her teens.  The government housing they live in, with two small children, is freezing and wet.  Her husband is abusive, and getting worse, as hope is not even a glimmer in his devastated life.  Across town, there is the near death by beating of a taxi driver, and police detective Charlie Resnick mulls over his jazz collection, but is probably dodging the extreme loneliness of his life.  Separate threads that eventually intertwine, largely due to the movement of the characters.  There is, eventually, a murder.  And it involves, that most overused of crime figures, a serial killer.  But in Harvey's hands it becomes something new, given his attention to character, dialogue, and setting.  Make it real, and readers will come.  Well, eventually.  Unfortunately, this book is out of print.  Which is a shame, since it's better than most crime novels, and better than most (big) \\"L\\"iterary efforts.  A good comparative novel would be George Higgins' \\"Outlaws.\\"  In fact, the late Higgins and Harvey are very similar.  Craftsmen all the way.	2004-07-10

Plotting, character, dialogue, all play out in a balanced and believable fashion in any given novel.  &quot;Blue Hour,&quot; &quot;Silent Joe,&quot; take your pick.  Parker is the kind of writer that makes other &quot;name&quot; writers jealous, simply because he's better. It's a shame his work has not found its way to the screen.  But even fine writers have their beginnings, and for Parker &quot;Laguna Heat,&quot; is his.<br />&quot;Laguna Heat,&quot; is not a bad novel.  In some ways it's a good one, but it is a first novel.  Tom Shephard, the police detective hero of the novel is in an incomplete man.  He has his demons - perhaps too many, since it seems like some sort of noir checklist.  One demon in particular, his anguish over shooting a teenager, seems way overblown, given that same teenager had just opened up another cop with a knife. Then there's the divorce, the drinking, the dominating father, the missing mother, the murderer of the missing mother, and a whole can of Laguna worms, etc.   Despite all of this, or because of all of them, Shephard's damaged state never really translates into a character one could care much about.   In constast, look at &quot;Joe,&quot; from &quot;Silent Joe,&quot; another damaged figure of good, who is complex and cared for by the reader.  More interesting are the various secondary characters, though even they have, by novel's end, a &quot;stock&quot; feel to them.  <br />But &quot;Laguna Heat&quot; does have its moments.  The best is perhaps Shepherd's night time swim in the ocean with his lover, Jane Algernon.  This is a gorgeous passage, and alone make &quot;Laguna Heat&quot; worth a read. It also reveals perfectly the dark romanticism of noir:<br /> &quot;He kicked hard and pulled deeply to keep up with her, careful to leave a few meters between them..  Past the waves he felt the bottom falling away and knew that even a few yards from shore the ocean was muchthe same as it was many miles out: strong, unfathomable, unforgiving of all that is not part of it.  And just as the first lappings of the waves had seemed to draw little parts of him away with them, he could now feel larger portions leaving too.  He recalled that he had been married once but wasn't sure to whom.  He believed that he rented an apartment somewhere in the town behind them but couldn't quote an address.  He knew he was a cop on a murder case but couldn't remember the specifics.  He wondered why he had ever quit surfing.  But the regret soon vanished.  He didn't know why and didn't want to know.  Was it possible to continue this way to Hawaii, or perhaps to an uninhabited tropical island where he and Jane could live on fish and fruit, procreate, wildly, found a race?  It seemed a possibility.  <br /> Then ahead of him, Jane Algernon's face collected in the darkness and it was smiling.<br /> &quot;Are you scared?  The rocks are under us, not far,&quot; she said.  Shephard could feel the churning of her legs as she kicked to stay afloat. Her hair was slicked back and the bones in her face caught the moonlight.&quot;<br /> The above is just a portion from an extended passage.  And it's such moments as these in &quot;Laguna Heat,&quot; that signal, like lightning flashes, the writer Parker is to become.	2004-07-03

Great dialogue, great characters, with crime, adultery, and porn spicing the stew. It's also one of Leonard's most brutal novels. There is one murder that is just shocking, but there is also the suggestion of sodomized rape as part of a kidnapping. You really hate the bad guys in this one. The hero, Harry Mitchell, is standard flawed good guy stuff. He's doing a slow burn while dealing with his problem -- which is his own doing, a twist for Leonard fans.  The ramifications of this problem, Harry's adultery, and how it touches (and ends!)so many lives is the effective subtext of the novel. The exchanges between Harry and Barbara, Mitchell's wife, are a good showcase for those that appreciate Leonard's mastery of dialogue. But what makes them a bit different than other Leonard exchanges, is that the topic is adultery, and how a married couple tries to deal with betrayal and damaged love.  <br />The downside: the ending. It's not just that it's something of a disappointing demise for the main bad guy. (You'd like to see Harry do something with drills and blowtorches.)  No, the ending is just clumsy and from a writing view point, and not well executed. And, perhaps worse, just not believable. The exchange (or the obviously ironic &quot;pickup&quot; or payoff), is so clunky, that no bad guy, especially a Leonard bad guy, would of been fooled. But maybe that's the point, there is no neat package of an ending, since Harry's &quot;mistake&quot; was the first domino. He will have to live with the damage he has caused, especially to his wife and his deal lover the rest of his life.	2004-03-28
US	52623565	R1N065V8OMKCKN	0380731851	733601761	Mystic River	Books	5	4	4	N	N	American Tragedy	To some extent it's unfortunate that Lehane is viewed as just as a writer of crime fiction. He's more than that. His pre-Mystic fiction was ok, but predictable, which makes the leap Lehane has made with both Mystic River and Shutter Island so startling. Both books were written by a writer who has a thorough understanding of tragedy -- and I mean tragedy as  found in novels such as Jude the Obscure, or King Lear, or even the Orestia.  Yes, the novel's action hinges on coincidence, but Hardy (and Shakespeare) used that device as well. And like those two, I don't feel Lehane's use of it damages the novel, since the overwhelming force of the story told swamps that  element.  Mystic River is a story about America, family and neighborhood (notice I'm not saying friendships). But mostly it's the downside of all those things, and how they sit within the larger traps of our lives. There is a little hope -- but not much.  And yet there are also choices, no matter how grim our lives are.  Each character in Mystic River eventually has to make a choice -- often a fatal one, no matter how well-meaning.  Don't be put off by the deliberate pacing of the novel, since in the end this will reinforce the deeper tragedy.  I think it's time that Lehane be discussed in the same breath as Cormac McCarthy, Stewart O'Nan, and Larry Brown, all frequenters of the American Night.	2004-02-07

What I found different is Archer's travels, be it Mexico, Nevada, and up and down California. In particular, his portrayal of an American colony in Mexico of drunks, artists, and others just hiding out, read true.  Same with the surfer kids in their zebra striped hearse. It's the kind of writing that gives you a slice of what the early sixties was like, but in a way that doesn't sound dated, but accurate.<br />The novel as a whole is moody, its story a dark (and very sad)one of sexual depravity, psychological cruelty, a deliberate red herring or two, and of course, murder(s).  To some extent I felt novel had too many characters, and it was hard to keep track of all the motivations, not to mention Archer's frenetic movements between Mexico, California, and Nevada.  But with MacDonald you get a master of character creation who possesses excellent descriptive powers. He can create a memorable character, with a history in the space of a paragraph or two. He's amazing. And his scenes can very suggestive, very dark.  In one, a little girl looking at a comic book suggests (possible) crimes of a much greater scale. But MacDonald doesn't dwell on it. He leaves you hanging, effectively haunting you for the rest of the book. You never know for sure, but it's that not knowing that shows MacDonald at his best. Within the scope of the novel, it's a small moment, but MacDonald cares about those small moments as he builds a whole.<br />If there is convolution in Zebra Striped Hearse, it's a small sin blown away by the fine descriptive powers of a master.	2003-12-30

Race relations. End Times. Such a wild mix shouldn't work, since in the hands of most authors it would result in overreaching. But Gruber, in a real swing for the fences, pulls it off. Home run!  Gruber's key for success is in his character development.  The central character, Jane Doe (no kidding!), comes across as a remarkable creation.  A (very) rich woman who happens to be an anthropologist and sorcerer, who also happens to be adept at aikido.  (Sounds like Laura Croft, but believe me, Jane is more resiliant.)  No, she's not Super Woman.  And her passages in the book remind me of a wry Joan Dideon (who can break your neck) caught in a nightmare.  There are times when Gruber is telling Jane's story that the prose authentically soars and riffs (especially in the African and Siberian portions of the story), and in a way that reminds me of LeCarre's \\"foreign\\" scenes from, such as, for example, \\"The Honorable School Boy (Cambodia-before-the-fall).  Like LeCarre, it's clear Gruber did quite a bit of research.<br />But Jane isn't the whole story.  There is Jimmy Paz (and it's nearly as much his story, as it is Jane's), a complex mix of a man.  He's a black Cuban-American homicide detective (with great Elmore Leonard like dialogue). He faces and harbors resentments in his daily life, but works beyond them. He's as much a hero as Jane, and  not some author poster board for speeches and canned sentiments.  Secondary characters, such as Barlow, Paz's fundamentalist-preacher cop partner, or Jane's father, same thing. Fully developed, leaving lasting impressions from their moment on Michael Gruber's stage.  Cant' do much better than \\"Tropic of Night.\\"	2003-12-07

It made such an impression on me, that for the last 3 to 4 years I have been looking for it in used book stores. Higgins was a great crime writer (Elmore Leonard turned to writing crime novels after reading Higgin's \\"Eddie Coyle\\"), but unfortunately, especially since his death, it seems his reputation is shrking down to only that of \\"The Friends of Eddie Coyle.\\"  And that's a shame, since \\"Outlaws\\" is arguably the greater novel.  \\"Eddie Coyle\\" is a fine novel. But with \\"Outlaws,\\" Higgins leapt beyond genre, into great fiction.<br />\\"Outlaws\\" on surface tells the story of a bunch of young college kids turned 60s era terrorists (SLA, Weathermen). But that's only part of it. \\"Outlaws\\" is also a book that captures what America was, is, and is heading toward. Lines converge in a way that bring together the CIA, organized crime, corruption, hypocrisy, infidelity, government sanctioned assasination, and terrorism, and casts them across the rapidly changing (or is it?) moral landscape of our country.  For you see, the robberies of the gang are simply stones dropped into the American pond. It's the ripples that they create that triggers the more real story. Higgin's method is inventive. It's true, most of the action is revealed in a delayed fashion, through conversations (dead on dialogue, of the kind you find in the best Leonard novels).  However, what makes the dialogue so fascinating in \\"Outlaws,\\" is that Higgins moves from one social (or professional) group to another, with complete beliavability. And in the case of the women socialites who dwell on the fault lines of where so many of the story lines converge, there is a chilling accuracy (in particular, at a memorable dinner party) that one finds in the 3 witches/fates of Macbeth. Words can cut and kill. The one truth that does come out: we are all, to some extent, Outlaws. It doesn't get better than this.	2003-11-26
US	52623565	R1HY2BUXF7IWGY	0517584921	515786853	Manhattan Nocturne	Books	3	8	10	N	N	Not quite	Well, Harrison can write. Perhaps too much. One major problem for the novel: Sex. A little in this department goes a long way. I've read plenty of sex scenes in novels, going back to Sonny Corleone shaking the door in the Godfather during the wedding. Good writers seem to know how to place such scenes within the larger context of the novel. Especially so in crime novels. With Harrison however, there seems to be a pornographic line crossed. (Suggestion and mystery - forget it.) Or perhaps it's meant to be a commentary on America and voyeurism.  Indeed, not far below the surface of Manhattan Nocturne are all kinds of commentaries - on sex, on celebrity, on film, on materialism and the power of money.  All are worthy topics, but any novel that tries to tackle them all is bound to fail.  Bound up in all these ruminations is the search for Truth, as Harrison reminds us through the mouths of several characters.  I suppose that's why the character Porter Wren can offer up such clear eyed but intimate details on his lovemaking with his wife. (He's a journalist after all.) But other than revealing there is a  mystery in her desires that has much to do with her, and little to do with him (other than fulfilling a big time male fantasy), it still doesn't reveal much about her other than suburban kinkiness.  (And of course, she's a good mother.)  The fact that Harrison returns to such bedroom scenes should be some sort of writing sin.  <br />On the good side, Harrison does create some memorable characters (Caroline is a good femme fatale).  In fact, Caroline's story within the story was more memorable than the actual story itself..  Dialogue sounds right. And the plot's not bad either, though twisty as hell, with something of a whimper ending. On the bad: continuous name dropping (Tarantino, Dan Quayle, Mayor Giuliani, etc.).  Manhattan Nocturne is simply an attempt to write a Big Important Novel (much like Tom Wolfe's attempts). That never works. A smaller, more focused one would of been a better approach.	2003-11-13

And there are no shortage of these outlaws in \\"Pomona Queen.\\"  Still, I found the novel to be a disappointment.  At its best, there is an Alice-in-the-Valley weirdness to \\"Pomona Queen\\" that works well.   In the novel's opening pages  middle aged vacuum cleaner salesman Earl (Johnny Magic) Dean, trying once again to get a grip on survival, accidently steps back into his past, encountering biker and thug Dan Brown, who is mourning (sort of) the murder of his brother - who happens to be on ice in Dan's living room.  Actually, it's more about revenge, though it's hard to tell, since lines of motivation converge and separate, often in the same conversation.  But that's cool, since following Dan's reasoning is kind of like an amusement park ride through Hell.  <br />More problematic however, is Earl's continuing reveries and/or meditations on the history of Pomona. A lot less of local history would of served Nunn well. No doubt Nunn intended to provide this as texturing.  All those bones and decay and betrayal from Pomona's history must mean Something, even if it's Nothing, though Earl sort of fancies himself as a \\"theologian of hope.\\"  But from a storytelling point of view, given the sheer number of pages devoted to what is in effect a slight-of-hand literary device, the novel gets bogged down with some truly unnecessary information. In this case, a leaner novel would of made for a much meaner one. Nevertheless, there are a number of very fine (and funny) moments in the novel, making \\"Pomona Queen\\" worth a look for those interested in the portrayals of hipsters at the end of the rainbow.  That said, it will be a cut &amp; paste effort, which is always frustrating, since one realizes that a novel's promise was somehow missed.	2003-11-10

The conflict between good and evil, is to some extent kept lower case here (not Good and Evil). Though the crimes of Glen Davis are shocking and extreme, by the novel's end he is a shrunken and pathetic figure, a damaged (but very dangerous) boy who could never accept one simple truth (which his father, the very flawed Virgil Davis, has come to recognize): we are all sinners. On the other hand, the novel's other major characters, use Love as a means to move on, to transcend, the hard things of life. Glen's kind of hate must eventually, in the end, devour itself. With that in mind, it is fitting that Glen's young son represents such a moving on beyond the sins of the father(s). Brown's ability to shape such messages and place it them the mouths (and souls) of his characters, while avoiding preaching, is what makes Father and Son a piece of fine literature.	2003-11-08

But, after getting out of prison, he is willing to give life a new go.  Before doing so however, he receives a message from an old love who is dying in Italy.  This old love -- Jane Graham, also an artist, and a somewhat famous one, turns out to have been the mother of a child Sloane was unaware of.  Apparently Sloane is the father, and he takes on the search for his missing daughter (Connie, now a 40 year old singer in NY), in an attempt to heal the divide between mother, daughter, and to some extent the hole within Sloane himself.  <br />But this is also a crime novel, and the sexual thug, Delaney,  poses a dangerous threat to both Connie and to others. (This guy is a real creep.) Throughout, Harvey's hand is sure, whether painting the nightclub scene in New York, or when actually discussing abstract painting. On surface, this may seem an oil and water mix (painting? crime?), but it works. Harvey integrates seamlessly the art world with the underbelly of the city.  Further, Harvey's research, and depiction, of 1950s New York, with its poets and its painters, rings true within the novel's framework.  One ding -- Harvey's neatly tying up (nearly) of all the loose ends to provide a happy ending (except for one character). Not quite noir -- which is why I'm giving it 4 stars. (I'll call it grey noir.) Still, perhaps we need those from time to time, especially when the story is so well crafted.  Definitely worth a read.	2003-11-05

He's so good that he can write in his sleep -- which may be the problem with A Fine Dark Line. Lansdale's ability in dealing with issues of race, sexuality, good and evil, is remarkable. You never feel like you're being preached to, which is probably a testimony to Lansdale's good common sense. However, in A Fine Dark Line, the ghosts invoked come from other novels. Anyone who has read To Kill a Mockingbird or Tom Sawyer, knows he or she has read earlier and greater efforts. A violent fight at night in a storm; a town mystery or two; a boy entering into early manhood; strange lights down by the railroad tracks; a headless girl. American Folklore 101. Yep. Lansdale's pushing the buttons. Still, this book is worth a read, since you quickly come attached to the Mitchel family and their friends. But if you've read Lansdale's The Drive-in, you'll find yourself longing for the early wild man, as opposed to this tame, mainstream version of a pulp master.	2003-10-01

But after reading The Getaway Man, I may have to reconsider. What the Getaway Man displays is an author who knows his genre. (My 5 stars is based upon a genre homerun -- The Getaway Man ain't Anna Karenina, but for what it is, it delivers.) <br />No need to go too much into plot and character, since so many have done so already. One comment however, Eddie is probably one of the more memorable crime-novel voices you will run across, right up there with Jim Thompson's Lou Ford -- though Eddie isn't evil, just sweetly loyal, up to a tragic point. With Vonda, his one strength in a hard world is turned against him. Probably the closest thing I've read to a Thompson novel, without being written by the master. There's no higher praise.	2003-09-29
US	52623565	RAJVVMUD1P97T	0316154601	239093791	Lost Light	Books	3	3	6	N	Y	Harry running out of steam	Lost Light in many ways is a solid novel. Pacing, character development, action, all are ok. But when contrasted with the series, you get the feeling that Connelly is going through the motions. His shift to first person, though interesting with its Chandler-like echo, feels like an authorial gimmick to give the series more juice. First person is usually a grabber, but here I just didn't sense any real accompanying tension (as one would find with Chandler).  Moreover, at this point in the Bosch series, such gimmicks have the entire weight of the series working against it. In particular, Connelly's need to touch base with previous characters from previous novels. While it's fine to refer to a universe that the author has carefully constructed novel by novel, such touching base needs to be developed slowly, and intergrated naturally into the plot. Here, Connelly's &quot;touching base&quot; is more like a listing of old times, good friends. There is no depth to the re-introductions. These characters are largely pieces, rather than people, to help move the story along. If you are a first time reader of Bosch/Connelly, this could be particularly annoying.<br />I have read 5 Bosch novels over the last year, but I found this one had the least edge.  The seams are showing more and more.  The ultimately red-herring terrorist story, with its post Septemeber 11 world, provided the most interest. I am interested to see how Connelly, and other popular authors, deal with such an darkly topical subject. And here Connelly does deliver, by showing the new paranoia, the ripple effect within law enforcement and how it impacts our freedoms, how even a trip to the library can become something else. <br />To some extent I suppose you should view Bosch as a human work in progress (and you do care about this guy).  At his best, he's a haunted, often angry man, with dark places. However, in Lost Light, Harry has mellowed with age (though the body count, by novel's end, is quite solid) to such an extent, that his little habits, whether it be his love of jazz, or chicken pot pies, is beginning to sound a bit fuddy duddy. Perhaps now is the time to pull the pin on Harry. The unbelievable (and manipulative (in a sappy way))ending provides Connelly with that option. I have to believe he's thinking about it.	2003-09-18

The sheer carnage reminds one of McCarthy's Outer Dark and Blood Meridian. But there's more. Ride With the Devil is also a coming of age novel telling the story of Jake Roedel, a young Bushwhacker (and immigrant's son), who has not known a woman, but who has killed 15 men.      In Woodrell's hands, Jake is a complex mix of child and killer. He has been hardened by a war that, in the contested border areas of Missouri & Kansas, was as murderous as modern day Bosnia.  Robbery, murder, torture, in an eye for an eye conflict, was the coin of the day. Nevertheless, the reader senses the human Jake trying to peek out from beyond the callus. Sometimes it's a moment of tragically misplaced pity for a northern militia acquaintance, or his growing interest  about the woman, the widow Sue Lee, of his \\"near\\" brother Jack Bull.  And then there's growing friendship with Holt, a freed slave who has been riding with the bushwhackers. A common ground gradually develops between the despised immigrant's son, and the mistrusted black man, as they see the south fall apart due to invasion.  Interestingly, Woodrell is able to show both characters growing dissatisfaction for the southern cause, as its increasingly being fought (the raid on Lawrence being a  point of true descent), while at the same time retaining their hate for northerners who seek to impose, through invasion, new rules for the old.  A subtle truth that historians still can't seem to get right, but which acquires an awful plausibility in the half-boy, half-man voice of Roedel.  This is fine novel that should be probably be viewed beyond the genre of a western and/or historical fiction. Certainly, the romance of the novel, is of a truer nature, given it is a time of war, than that of the prize winning Cold Mountain.  Ride With the Devil can sit quite comfortably beside that Frazier's fine novel. It has it's own grim, but ultimately hopeful truths, to pass on.	2003-09-13

So well, that he's unafraid of well worn cliched language, since he places it within a strong plot of cross and double-cross.  For example, check out this late in the novel dialogue between the plotting lovers Luke and Kinnerly:<br />\\"You ever play chess, Luke?\\"<br />\\"I've never played the game.\\"<br />\\"Answer this.  If you put real mone in there, what are ou going to do if the worst you think is true? Track me to South America and kill me?\\"<br />\\"I wouldn't let ou get away with it.  You're right about that and about me sending you ahead to see if I can trust you.  But the money is real.  It wouldn't be a test if it wasn't.\\"<br />\\"We thought we were going to get through this, and still and love trust each other, too. But you're rotten, Luke.\\"<br />\\"We're a pair. Don't tell me you haven't figured out that if we get caught I'll go to the chair.\\"<br />\\"Yes, I thought of that.\\"  Her profile in the dash lights, with her hair blown back, looked as valiant as a ship's figurehead.<br />-- Sound familiar. You bet it does. Whether it comes  from \\"From Out of the Past\\", \\"Touch of Evil\\", \\"Chinatown\\", or \\"Lost Highway\\", such dialogue captures best the dark romanticism of the night. Too often modern writers of noir mock their tradition through deliberately goofy plotting or the use of similar dialogue and setting done in a tongue in cheek manner (the over rated Crumley comes to mind.)  With \\"The Hit\\" Hoar writes in the tradition with a select few of the past and present. I look forward to his future efforts.	2003-08-30
US	52623565	R1X469H5K841SS	0312303556	557837036	The Guards: A Novel	Books	1	13	27	N	N	sloppy and lame	The blurbs on the back of Ken Bruen's novel \\"The Guards\\" are impressive: Boston Teran, James Crumley, and T. Jefferson Parker, who all weigh in with thumbs up. And these are wonderful writers who have written fine books that I really admire. So I'm mystified over their enthusiasm. In contrast, what I found in \\"The Guards\\" was a loosely told story about a drunk cop who pretty much stays that way. Oh, there's a story nibbling around the edges regarding some missing women and the bad men who did them in, but that's pretty much it, though you could probably toss in some mid-life crisis moments as an extra yawn subplot. Justice comes around, as you know it must, but only as a kind of remember-to-burp afterthought.  The novel has virtually no inner tension. It's part joke and valentine to a genre. There's local Galway color -- with various characters who seem to be either members of the Pogues (in particular Cathy B. -- who I wanted to see more of), older Irish thugs (Sutton -- who may or may not be Irish), or stock figures such as quipping Irish priests and iron willed martyed mothers.  The love interest (and not-to-be-believed grieving mom), Ann, is more a sketch of a character than a character. Ian Rankin delivers similar Local Stuff in a far more substantive way. With Rankin, you know you've read a story. In comparison to any Rankin novel, \\"The Guards\\" reads like something hastily written out on a bar napkin. Dialogue is supposed to a big deal with this novel, and it is pretty good. But comparisions to Elmore Leonard, who always remembers he needs a story to go with the dialogue, is simply name-dropping and nothing more. Where the book excels is in its various what-to-read and what-to-listen to suggestions.  (Bruen does have good tastes in those areas.) But that's not enough to escape the ripped-off feeling one feels after reading this mess.	2003-05-24
US	52623565	RLYOI47DYCB6F	0425185176	738776514	Unidentified	Books	2	5	6	N	N	Unrealized	Matthew Costello's new novel, &quot;Unidentified,&quot; opens ominously enough, with a scientist heading to the ocean floor in a minisub to see what he can see. Most horror fans know that what's on the ocean floor will probably not allow the scientist to see the light of day again.  <br />But before the reader can get comfortable, the story shifts to another scientist, working for a genetic research company (Gentech) in New York, who stumbles across a secret file that contains DNA readouts unlike any the scientist has ever seen.  Unease starts to grow, and she gets up to leave with her discovery secreted away, when...the story shifts, to a young student  heading home from her London school, not knowing the danger her father is in. And so on and so on.<br />This pattern of scene shifts maintains itself throughout the novel.  On one hand, it could be argued that such a device heightens tension, keeps the reader turning pages, etc., but in &quot;Unidentified,&quot; this tool instead makes for a frustrating, choppy read.  Costello has a potentially good story on his hands, with its hints at a Lovecraftian horror, a mysterious metal house in the Scottish highlands, a strange town that Lewis Carroll would love, and killers who can crop up anywhere, anytime. Reality is a slippery concept.  And Costello can quickly create believable characters (not an easy thing to do), but after he creates them, he rushes to another scene, another character, another place on the globe. For example, the author goes through the trouble of creating a crusty Jacques Cousteau-like figure (Father Farrand) on a marine research vessel who also happens to be a priest. The reader is intrigued about the possibilities of science and theology and, well, horror.  All Costello ends up doing is having the character become monster meat.  Which is fine, but more could of been done with the character before turning him into chum. Remember the brief, but very effective, appearance of the old Jesuit in the old1930s movie &quot;Werewolf of London.&quot; The old fellow, up in the movie's Tibetan snows, actually had something to say. It would of been nice if Father Farrand would of been given a similar opportunity to say something, foolish or wise, to contribute to the story.   <br />Basically, the main problem is that the author simply never allows his story to settle down into a pace, other than the frenetic introductory one established in the first few pages. And that's too bad, because Costello can write.  I'm not a huge fan of padded horror epics, but this is one case where another hundred pages or more would of added the kind of texture this novel needed. As it stands now, &quot;Unidentified&quot; reads more like an outline for a potentially good book, with a number of very fine character sketches and scenes to build upon (which is why I'm giving it two stars).  But as a finished work, there's not  enough here for even a bad novel.	2002-07-17

But &quot;The Mineral Palace&quot; isn't it.  &quot;The Mineral Palace&quot; is a good novel, but it is overlong and crowded with too many figures and forebodings that drown out a potentially effective ending.  The novel starts out promisingly enough with a scene straight from a Kurosawa film: a dog trotting along with a prosthetic arm in its mouth.  Bena, the main figure in the novel, looks warily at the dog, while constantly doing computations regarding fate -- an effective device that is later dropped at about the halfway point of the novel. Bena is a fascinating and complex character, with her guilts and desires, playing themselves out on the devasted moonscape of Pueblo Colorado, circa 1934. Julavets spends a great deal of time developing her.  And she largely succeeeds.  Where the author fails, is in the sheer accumulation of grotesque figures populating the novel. There is a rich one-legged woman thumping around on an elephant tusk; a fated prostitute who does litte more than shriek throughout the novel; two feed store clerks straight out of &quot;Deliverance&quot;; an unbelievable heart-of-gold Sam Elliot like cowboy, who never grows beyond the Marlboro Man, etc.  None of these figures are bad in themselves, but only half were probably needed (along with about a 100 less pages).  On the other hand there is a wonderful evil figure in Horace Gast, who is central, and one I wish Julavits had of spent even more time exploring his various dark corners along with his relationship the town.  Up to about the halfway point of the novel I was ready to give this 4 or more stars. But the novel seemed to lose much of its energy after this.  Revelations such as infaticide, suicide, and incest, lacked the kind of wallop they should of had on the reader. It seems to me that Julavits, with her remorseless universe, was going for Aeschylus via Thomas Hardy (or perhaps better: William Faulkner).  Still, this is a novel worth reading. Like Faulkner, Julavits delivers chapters that can stand alone as stories. Two, &quot;The Stolen Pillbox&quot; (where Bena meets an on-the-run Bonnie Parker), and &quot;Buffalo Mass Suicide&quot; are fine examples of a short story writer showing her strength.  &quot;The Mineral Palace&quot; is, at 300 pages, an ambitious novel. I hope Julavits' next novel is more pared back. But I also look forward to it.	2000-11-05

Cordrescu's idea of linking the past (Bathory), with present (the current problems in the Balkans as represented in the figure Drake), is  solid.  But as the novel unfolds, he barely scratches the surface of  possibilities. The litany of horrors -- and there are plenty -- eventually  leave the reader bored. The violence and sex become gratuitous when it  becomes apparent that there is no progression in the story, and that what  you're reading seems more and more like a cut and paste job.  The last two  hundred pages are torture (maybe that's the point).  Still, you can find  some good stretches in this book.  But if you have something else on the  shelf (King, Straub -- if its horror you want), I suggest starting there.	1999-06-20

Mr. Farwell can certainly write.  The Stonewall of his book comes across as a real person, warts and all.  Jackson's mistakes are here along with his many victories. The author  explodes a few myths, but objectively, and in the end deepens our  understanding of the man and the general.  There were two nits I did see in  the book: The CSS Merrimac (really the Virginia); and the 1862 date for  Chancellorsville.  But these are minor.  Read this book.	1999-02-26
US	52623565	R1SDBHSES5S7LD	0374112967	950029887	Birthday Letters	Books	5	2	3	N	N	A heart laid bare	Don't listen to the Amazonian critics, or the writers of chopped up prose who are called poets, this is riveting, sad stuff.  As best he can, Hughes lays his heart bare.  Does he hold back regarding himself and his own darkness? Some I think.  But just how detached can one be in such a drama? Are there some self-serving poems?  A few.  Not nearly as many as I expected after reading Henry Taylor's review in the Washington Times.  But that just makes this all the more sad.  He is a human being living through a bewildering situation.  Besides, this book is not a slam on Sylvia.  You come out of it feeling sad at the tragedy of someone losing there mind, and the need to continue loving them, even in death.  A good book to read along with this is the &quot;Unquiet Mind&quot; by Jamieson.  Whatever his personal shortcomings, Hughes clearly loved his wife.  It took a generous heart for him to release this; and sadly, some will revile him for it.  Read this book.	1998-03-04

By novel's end, I was so caught up in little Useppe's fate that I could barely take it.  When through I thought about the novel, and its characters often.  Morante has crafted a modern story of Job -- with its unanswered question of &quot;why?&quot;	1998-02-15
