I picked this book up and was VERY surprised at how easy it reads.  If you want a book that will give you the ins and outs of Apollo without getting bogged down in alot of technical detail buy this book.  The men and women who gave their time and lives for the goal of putting a man on the moon all deserve our respect, they definatley have mine.  Thank You...	2001-05-09

The simple idea of it is so outstanding.  I loved this book and just finished reading it for the 4th time.  The idea of it still just amazes me.  Crichton is one hell of a genius...	2000-09-20
US	50927734	R1BBV26CW3O9SV	039914563X	225323965	The Bear and the Dragon	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Good	Not great.  I have always enjoyed Tom Clancys books often reading them  twice or more and still staying up till 2am reading.  His large storylines  always come together so well and this book was no different.  However this  book could have been better.  I feel like he drew out the beginning like i  always expect of him and then i strap my self in for one hell of a finish.   This book however needed an extra 200 to 300 pages to really make it good.   He compressed the end too mucch and that is something i really never expect  from him.  I still found myself staying up till all hours reading it  though.  If you are a Clancy fan you should read this but if you are just  getting into him read this one last after all of his others(in order  prefferably).  I still eagerly await the next one.	2000-08-30

It was amazing the way it  was written you have to wonder how close that was to the truth.  The action  and drama was just perfectly crafted, and weaved together so well.  The  best WWII fiction book around.  Pick this one up...	2000-08-24

I shudder to think about what would happen if the Chinese did in fact get SEAWOLF the most advanced submarine ever constructed.  The book was masterfully  written, Robinson didn't stay too long on a subject and always kept you  guessing.  I resisted skipping to the end to see how things turned out.  If  you read one submarine book this year make it USS SEAWOLF.   Patrick ol'boy  if you read this i can NOT WAIT for a sequel...	2000-06-12

I was waiting for his next book about 5 min. after finishing his last one, Plum Island.  Plum Island is my favorite novel of all time.  When i was found out that this was a sequel needless to  say i was bouncing.  This was a great book my only complaint is not enough  of my favorite character John Corey.  He is in it but i got spoiled reading  Plum where he is in every page.  If you liked Plum READ THIS.  It is great  to see him back in action.	2000-05-14

I am not a fisherman and have never spent time on the ocean, but this book was incredible.  I went through it so quick and when you stop to think that this REALLY happened it gives you a moment of pause.  My heart goes out to  all the families of the men lost aboard the Andrea Gail.  The afterword by  Sebatian Junger was particulary interesting seeing what has happened to him  since writing this book.  His constant nightmares about being onboard  during the storm.  This book was heartwrenching it is incredible please  read it you will never forget what happened to those brave men.	2000-04-19

This book had a great degree of emotion.  It is a prequel to all his books and i think a running tie for #1 no techno stuff to bog you down.   It really put you in the mind of John Terrance Kelly; one of the first  navy SEALs.  It explains Kellys tranformation into Mr. Clark.  A MUST  READ!	2000-03-13

I first picked this book up when i heard the movie was coming out.  I started reading but the style got to me and I stopped.   After seeing the movie I was entranced.  It is the greatest movie of all  time.  I went back and went right through the book.  I have read it 3 times  to date and love every page.  If you loved the movie read this book it  really delves into the 3 characters and spans years.  I can not put into  words how truely classic this book is.  Wish i could have been a cop back  then.	2000-03-10

I read this book the summer it came out during that time the embassies in Africa were bombed, Rainbow was looking very good about then.   This book has one of the best storylines i have ever seen!   It makes you  think if we really have a group like this out there i think it would be a  good idea.  They aree probably operating right now......and we would never  know.  If one of them is reading this keep up the good work.....	2000-02-13
