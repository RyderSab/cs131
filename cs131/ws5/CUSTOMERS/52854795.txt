From funny to heartbreaking to admirable, the stunning variety of soldiers that entered the Union armies is fascinating.  Some regiments were specifically formed to take in ethinc soldiers of a certain nationality but when few recruits of that group joined they took in all comers.  The ethinic makeup of the Union forces was often times as colorfull as their wide variety of uniforms.	2005-09-22

One need only read accounts of Union prisoners captured early in the war, especially at the Seven Days battles (\\"Fallen Soldier\\" by Andrew Roy comes to mind), to see that poor treatment of Federal POWs was a hallmark of Confederate captivity from almost the beginning of war and preceded the likes of Elmira by two years.  Union soldiers who were exchanged and sent back home or returned to the army reported that Libby and the other tobacco warehouse prisons in Richmond were full of wounded men not being properly cared for, that prisoners had to sleep on floors covered with excrement, had bad drinking water, poor rations, and could barely even breath in the fetid atmosphere of buildings designed to store tobacco, not hold prisoners.  This attitude toward Union prisoners, even while the exchange system was still operating, fostered a like-minded attitude in the North toward prisoners.  I'm not saying that two wrongs make a right, but today's neo-secessionists blind themselves to the fact that bad treatment of prisoners was first initiated by the Confederates.  I give this book two stars as a compromise:  four-stars for the research, but only one-star for drawing narrow conclusions and obviously playing up to an audience of neo-Confederate revisionists who seem to think the only way to somehow explain Andersonville is to scream \\"Elmira\\" while deliberately forgetting about the early-war Richmond warehouse-prisons had no early-war Union counterpart.   <br /> <br />	2005-07-07

This is one of the best narratives of a common Civil War soldier's experiences in battle that I've ever read.  Shepard was a member of the 146th New York Volunteer Infantry, also know as Garrard's Zouaves or the Fifth Oneida.  Shepard was one of the many casualties the 146th suffered in Saunder's Field on the first day of the Battle of the Wilderness.  He recounts not only the battle, but his wounding and being taken prisoner.  When I visited the Wilderness battlefield I took the book with me and re-read it as I literally walked in Shepard's footsteps on the very site where most of the narrative takes place.	2005-05-16

The author does a masterful job of setting up the awesome and ominous battle of the Wilderness, but in the concluding chapters his reflections become unjustly negative toward the National Park Service and local residents.  The NPS doesn't interpret obscure areas of the battlefield to Mr. Cushman's statisfaction, he portrays NPS employees as somewhat cluesless, and local residents are equally out-of-touch about the battlefied.      The simple fact of the matter is that the National Park Service does a spectacular job with what they have to work with and many of the local residents care deeply about the history that surrounds them and are members of the Friends of Wilderness Battlefield organization. Overall the book is very good, but Cushman's concluding pity-party was a real letdown.	2005-04-19
US	52854795	R19R2VZ0ZCA8XD	1589820142	487503212	Cold Harbor	Books	2	0	0	N	Y	Author's ignorance of the battlefield ruins book.	I wish I could be as enthusiastic about this book as some of the other reviewers are.  But, since much has been made about the authenticity and accuracy of this novel, which unfortunately influenced me to buy it, I would be remiss if I didn't point out a very glaring error that spoiled the whole book for me.    <br />I get the distinct impression that the author has never actually been to Cold Harbor, at least not before setting down to write. While knowledge of battlefield landmarks is not necessarily a prerequisite for a novelist as much as it would be for a non-fiction writer, to cite non-fiction works as a source, and then write an incredible line like &quot;there are no graves here and no cemetery&quot; is disingenuous.  <br />Contrary to what Mr. Keith has written and what his characters believe, the Cold Harbor National Cemetery, established in 1866, sits almost in the middle of the battlefield today.  It lies very near the Cold Harbor Unit of the Richmond National Battlefield Park which preserves only a small fraction of this vast battlefield.   Most of the graves in the cemetery are &quot;unknowns.&quot;  Indeed, at the back of the cemetery, on either side of a large white marble monument designed to resemble a 19th century style casket, are two mass burial trenches containing hundreds of skeletal remains collected from the battlefield after the war.  Yet, according to the author &quot;there are no graves here and no cemetery.&quot;<br />This is an odd statement in light of the fact that one of the most famous photographs associated with the Civil War illustrates one of several grim re-burials that took place on the Cold Harbor battlefield after the war.  Indeed this photograph is reproduced in the one of the non-fiction works the author cites as an historical source!  But Mr. Keith gives the reader the impression that the dead all must have somehow vanished into thin air.  Incredibly, there is even a character in the book, a battlefield guide no less, whodoesn't seem to know anything about the  cemetery.  Not to mention that fact that a burial party is also described in the book.  Oh, well.  I guess it's more poetic to pretend that wild flowers are surrogate gravestones.  But a scene in that cemetery, in front of that ghostly white monument standing between those two mass graves, would have been real poetry.  Failing to familiarize himself with the actual battlefield cost the author credibility and a chance to write a scene worthy of Melville or Crane. (I also noted the author's post-war description of Richmond to be rather odd.  He mentions that some of the buildings in the city still showed the effects of gunfire, yet even the most casual student of the war knows Richmond never came under enemy fire during the entire war!)  <br />If the main character of this book could make the effort to visit the battlefield, you'd think the author himself could have done as much.  Then he would have seen for himself that there are indeed graves and a cemetery at Cold Harbor and not just &quot;an open space and not much more than that.&quot;	2004-07-14

I first read this book a little under a year ago and at that time I thought it was great.  I believed ever word written by Hunt, an author I have read and admired for quite a while.  Now, incredibly, it is almost a year later and I have decided to convert to Catholicism and will start RCIA classes in September.  How could I have read and agreed with this startling anti-Catholic tome and just a few months later begun the process of converting to Catholicism?  On the road to Damascus the Lord asked the future Apostle Paul, &quot;Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?&quot; I can imagine how Saul must have felt.  <br />I followed up my reading of this book with a mission; to do more research, not to prove Hunt wrong, but rather to prove him right.  I couldn't.  In my desire to point fingers like Hunt and make accusations at Catholicism, the Holy Spirit confronted me with the question the Lord asked Saul.  I had no answer to give, other than my own vanity.  Instead of trying to be meek and humble like Jesus, I found myself indulging in the practice of falt-finding in others, particularly Catholics.  Even worse I realized I was becoming a false prophet and practicing divination by trying to read the future using Biblical prophecy. I thank the Lord for putting me back on the straight and narrow.<br />I'll give Hunt's book at least two stars because it did set me on the road to discovering the true historical Church which was founded by Jesus and is today called Catholicism.  Remember what the Lord himself said, &quot;Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.&quot;	2004-03-13

For Catholic and Protestant traditionalists who have visited the Holy Land and are convinced the crucifixion and resurrection took place at either the sites of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre or the Garden Tomb, you will be in for a rude awakening.  <br />I can't really add much to the positive reviews that already appear here, so permit me to take away a star from what would otherwise be a 5-star review and gripe on one point:  the authors of this well-written and thought-provoking work give very little credit to the ground-breaking scholarship previously done by the late Dr. Ernest L. Martin in his book &quot;Secrets of Golgotha.&quot;  <br />&quot;Rod of an Almond Tree&quot; is much more accessible to general readers than Martin's weighty tome and makes some new revelations, but the authors' failure to give Martin full  acknowledgement within the body of their text for his discovery years ago of the true site of the crucifixion (hidden in plain site within the scriptures themselves) is a grave oversight.   Don't pass this book up, but if you want to explore this subject in greater depth then &quot;Secrets of Golgotha&quot; is a must.	2004-01-21

The story covers only twenty pages of text (not counting the illustration pages).  It's about New Bedford's \\"Stone Fleet;\\" old whaling ships sent to be sunk in the mouth of Charleston harbor as a blockading measure during the Civil War.  <br />In my opinion it fails as a children's book (Ages 10 and up) on several levels.  We never really get to the know the narrator, a twelve year old boy that helps collect stones from his uncle's farm to fill the empty holds of the fleet.  Although he narrates the story, he remains enigmatic and hence rather unlikable.  The reader will never warm to him as a character or relate to him.  Additionally, the story presented is a depressing one and the author focuses heavily on the futility of the Stone Fleet's mission.  Finally, the illustrations are as dark, depressing and lifeless as the text.  None of the above combine well to make a good children's book, no matter what the age of the reader.  This is the type of pretentious book that a teacher will assign, but that the child will have no genuine interest in reading.  <br />The afterword recounts the true history of the Stone Fleet and is more readable and interesting than the fictional story.  One wonders why the author didn't develop this fasinating moment of history into something more substantial, a longer novel with more depth, better character development and much less depression. It's books like this that turn children off from reading.	2003-10-23

Lee never made the mistake of sending troops into massive frontal assaults against impregnable positions.  Yet Lee was far more experienced at wasting troops in useless attacks than Grant.  One need only examine the disasterous Confederate attacks at Malvern Hill in 1862 and Gettysburg in 1863 to see that Lee had his own share of &quot;Cold Harbors.&quot;  And that is exactly where this book fails.  While Furgurson does debunk some of the myths of Cold Harbor, he acutally manages to bolsters the myth of Lee's saintly invicibility.

The story would have been just as good without all the gender-bending and kink in my opinion, but I guess Follet feels his readers aren't getting enough PC indoctroncation from every other artistic medium, so he decided to make it a major theme in this novel.

Far from being an objective historian, Dilorenzo writes with a huge chip on his shoulder. Slogging through this nausiating diatribe, the reader begins to wonder just what personal slight a man who's been dead for over 130 years could have done to fill the author with such anger. DiLorenzo just can't seem to find anything good to say about Lincoln, or America for that matter. (He and Sean Penn should get together.)  The book reads like another one of those consipracy theories. Every little problem we have today is all Lincoln's fault, or so DiLorenzo says, and according to the author, there is plenty of material to back this harebrained claim up. Unfortunatly most of the works he cites are from both far left and far right fringe writers, commentators, and revistionist historians. As the saying goes, garbage in, garbage out.	2002-11-09

David Levinthal's color photographs are superb, bringing life to these little plastic people and animals at their eye-level, much as we saw and remember them when we were kids.<br />The color photographic layouts of various playsets are divided into three chapters. &quot;Our World&quot; contains great shots of the Marx Dollhouse, Skyscraper, Schoolhouse, Boyscouts, Jetport, Service Station, and &quot;The Untouchables&quot; playsets.

This is one of the most imaginative coffee-table photography books I've seen in ages.<br />Now comes my only negative comment which robbed this otherwise superb book of one star.  David Corey's introduction leaves a lot to be desired.  While it provides some historical information on Louis Marx and his company there really isn't enough info to satisfy the knowledge-seeking reader.  The overblow and pretentious text contrasts sharply with Levinthal's photos injecting cynasism and misplaced intellectualism with photographs of a child's world where that kind of drivel has no place.<br />Corey's self-serving intro is a bit bizarre to say the least.  He writes, &quot;The service-station attendant in my playset was in some ways as tragic as Oedipus, as confined by time, place and action to his inescapable destiny, while I, like the Athenian spectator - or better still, the demiurge - could contemplate the conditions of...&quot;  What the heck is he talking about?

While other successful authors of military novels such as Tom  Clancey go out of thier way to be factually  acurate, Hutton takes a  hapharzard approach to exsisting facts that undermines the authority with  which he trys to speak about the Coast Guard.  He doesn't seem to know the  difference between a 210' WMEC and a 110' patrol cutter.  He doesn't seem  to know the difference between a 44' motor surfboat and 41' utility boat.   Although such minutia may be of little concern to the average reader, the  Coastie who picks up this book (and I can't imagine many folks outside the  USCG even wanting to read it) will become frustrated with the poor research  from the very first page.  <br />Beyond the factual errors the story itself is  rather dull.  It contains cookie-cutter  characters:  There's the alcoholic  officer with a heart of gold who's always in trouble with his superiors.   He falls in love with the female officer who has beauty AND brains.  Then  there's  the token gay enlisted man trying to hide his sexuality, the  commanding officer who's interested only in furthering his own career by  stepping on everyone, etc. etc. etc.  You've seen it all before in a dozen  other formats.  <br />It may merit watching Hutton to see what he produces in  the expected sequal to A Deep Blue Sounding (to be called  &quot;Coxsakie&quot;), but if the factual errors and cardboard characters  aren't gone by then, I know I won't be investing in the third volume of the  trilogy.	2000-06-23

I don't doubt it at all.  Having done time in  the &quot;black shoe&quot; Coast Guard on cutters, I was a first hand  witness to what Dr. Noble mentions: the CG officer corps places so much  emphasis on the seagoing Guard they forget and ignore the small boat  stations.<br />I hope this book will serve as a wake-up call for those at HQ.   I'm certain it will &quot;frost&quot; a lot of behinds.  But its high time  they smell the coffee and make necessary changes before the CG has it alter  its nickname from &quot;Lifesavers&quot; to &quot;Life-losers.&quot;  <br />Every member of Congress and the Senate should read this book to get a  full understanding of the imortance of Coast Guard small boat stations and  why they can no longer continue to remain undermanned, underfunded, and  overworked.	2000-03-30

This edtion of the Coast Guardsman's Manual is getting a bit long in the tooth, particularly in  regard to the enlisted specialty ratings.  Most of the aviation ratings are  gone or have been consolidated and renamed yet you'll still find, for  example, Aviation Structural Mechanic listed and described.  It's the same  with some of the other ratings also.  With the demise of CW (Morse Code)  500kHz maritime distress watchkeeping the Radioman rating was changed years  ago to Telecommunications Specialst.  Its just a pity the CG didn't take  away their &quot;sparks&quot; insignia and make it a cell phone instead.   And one other thing... is the Coast Guard ever going to change that boring  dress uniform?  No wonder the vast majority of Americans have no idea that  the CG is a branch of the military.  The dress uniform makes them look like  bus drivers!	2000-01-09

But in reality the book is told from a very narrow and restrictive point-of-view (. . . )There's nothing wrong with that except he practically ignores the fact that the West 42nd Street sex shops, peep shows, and massage parlors were also an attraction for heterosexual men. The reader will get painfully tired of reading endless descriptions of Delaney's sexual exploits among the XXX theater crowd.   Additionally, the handfull of black and white photos of the empty storefronts of the \\"Forty Deuce\\" were taken after most of the shops had been driven out of business. Without good photos of the way 42nd Street used to be, the vibrant nature of the area is greatly diminished and Delaney's text doesn't make up for it. If you are looking for a social history of the old Times Square, something balanced and better illustrated, try Josh Alan Friedman's \\"Tales of Times Square\\" instead.	1999-11-20

Yes, Russell Banks is a great writer, but let's give the man back his humanity.  Let's assume, just for a moment, that he is capable of writing a stinker.  &quot;Rule of the Bone&quot; is probably Bank's  once-in-a-lifetime awful book.  It's a struggle just to move your eyes  across the pages of this book due to Bank's intentionally awful sentence  structure. Here is a sample:  &quot;In the beginning and all winter I was  only dealing small-load weed to the bikers which was cool becaue A, lots of  kids in Au Sable were dealing then mostly in school where I never went near  anyhow but everywhere around town too so we were like a swarm of flies and  it was low-risk to be one of them what with so few swatters.&quot;  Yes, I  fully understand that Banks wrote the book as if a 14 year old had written  it, but this same technique was done a century ago by Mark Twain.  And  Twain did it better.  And he used punctuation consistantly.  Now, try to  imagine getting through 390 pages of this mess without going blind.  Simply  put, &quot;Rule of Bone&quot; is a gimmick novel for the trendy who like to  pretend it's some kind of great work of art.  Don't be fooled. Emperor  Banks has no clothes.   &quot;Rule of the Bone&quot; is a terrible novel.	1999-10-17

This is the fictional account of a young boy from Maine who enlists in the 20th Maine infantry  regiment, fights at Gettysburg, is captured at the Wildreness, ends up at  Belle Island prison, escapes, returns to his regiment and... well, I won't  tell the ending.  A pity this book has been long out of print.  Despite  being a children's book, it has a rather dark and brooding anti-war theme,  not the usual fair for kids.

I'm older and wiser now, I thought, so  maybe I might finally &quot;get&quot; whatever it was I missed in the first  reading decades ago.  I should have stuck with my initial teenage  impressions.  This book bored me in '70s and it still bored me in the '90s.   Great charactor names like... Major Major Major Major!  Wow, that's really  funny!  Whew!  This book is a stinker.

The  issue frequently under debate is whether to &quot;ban&quot; Huck Finn from  classrooms because of the infamous &quot;N-word.&quot;  This issue  therefore begins and ends with secondary and high school parents and  teachers.  Academics with PHd's have little to nothing to do with this  debate in the real world other than to provide sound-bites for the media.   The people who need this type of book, the non-academic parents and  students who will end up having do live with the results of the debate need  not look to Arac's text except as a sleeping pill.  What could have been a  very lively reading on a stimulating subject is submerged by the author  with the usual academic psycho-babble.  Weigh this book against Shelly  Fisher-Fishkin's popular and highly accessible &quot;Was Huck Black?&quot;  and &quot;Lighting Out for the Territory&quot; and you can see why the  pro-Twain faction always comes out looking better even if they lose the  debate. Arac's book is inaccessible to the average parent (black or white)  who must continually resort to a reactionary mode when faced with the  prospect that their child will have to see and hear the word  &quot;nigger&quot; when Huck Finn is assigned in class.  As a result this  is hardly a work of &quot;scholarship in the service of citizenship.&quot;   It is a work of scholarship in the service of exclusive academia only.  I'm  not saying that the book should have been &quot;dumbed down&quot; for use  by the average reader, but that the text reeks of stereotypical academic  snobbery.  As Huck Finn himself might have said, &quot;This book puts on  airs.&quot;  It's a pity becasue Arac raises some good points, which are  unfortunately lost in ten dollar words and page length sentences.	1999-10-02

The book gets down-right dull whenever Raphael starts talking about his own life and work and you will be skipping  a few paragraphs here and there to find the next direct reference to  Kubrick.  At the end you will find you've learned little to nothing about  Kubrick's complex personality... other than it was indeed very complex.   But I don't think Raphael is trying to portray Kubrick as a  &quot;self-hating Jew,&quot; which recent newspaper articles accuse this  book of doing.  As usual, the media has taken isolated quotes completely  out of context.<br />The book's only real worth is that it provides a rare  glimpse past the tall hedges and security fences of Kubrick's estate in  England, but nothing about rooms and hallways filled with clutter and pets  should come as any surprise.  <br />Some insight into how Kubrick approached a  film during the screenwriting phase could prove enlighting for the serious  student, but overall the book ends up feeling like a hack job that was  slapped together just to take commercial advantage of Kubrick's recent  death and the release of his last film.	1999-06-26

Usually they seem to be nothing more than a ploy by publishers to get you to throw your money away on another game manual when you've already got the one in the box that came with the software.  Often they are too heavy on narrative and don't really bother giving the reader other than a handfull of tips and hints in the usual 200+ pages.  And half the time they just give you step by step &quot;go here, do that, and you'll win&quot; guides through each scenario leaving the gamer with no challanges.<br />Maybe its because Sierra's SWAT 2 fuzzy logic programming has the scenarios reacting differently each time the game is played, but Josh Mandel's strategy guide seems like a real strategy guide, not just another narrative about the game that does nothing more than give away the plot.  Here are usefull tips and hints that tell you how to think like a SWAT officer.  Depending on how well you listen, the outcome of each scenario! , and ultimately the game, is still up to the reader/gamer.  Lavishly illustrated, with a good tip on the margin of almost every page, it also contains a ton of info on real police SWAT tactics.  This is a decent companion to the game and one of the few strategy guides I've ever bothered to read cover to cover.  And it has an index, a rarity for most PC strategy guides!!!<br />Most of the reviews of I've read on the SWAT 2 game have been positive while pointing out some flaws in the game.  After reading this guide I realized the game isn't flawed at all, in fact its almost perfect.  You just have to know how to deploy your SWAT and assault teams and snipers in the proper manner and when to use tear gas, flashbangs, entry explosives and the other tools of the SWAT trade.  No, I haven't master the game yet, but I probably would have given up on it long before if it wasn't for this excellent guidebook.  I can hardly wait for the SWAT 2 mission pack coming out in January '99... and I!  hope Josh Mandel provides another guide for it too.	1998-08-10

Based on notes he made in the field during World War II, the author spends too much time revisiting his every thought instead of describing what was going on. The book does provide a fairly good perspective of a well-educated infantryman in the war if you are willing to skim over page after page of annoying \\"holier-than-thou\\" philosophizing.  But what is worse about this book is the pervasive atmosphere of self-pity that the author exudes.

Not that it matters.  The game is kinda fun but for those who would like to win once in a while its a letdown and the strategy guide doesn't  help other than cluing the reader in on the game's four lame cheat codes.   In a day and age when any decent PC game is totally mouse controlled, this one utilizes a boatload of difficult keyboard commands.  Billed as a nostagia game that harkens back to the days when you played with little green plastic army men in the backyard, the designers seem to have failed to realize that their aging target audience doesn't have the timing or the motor skills anymore to execute lighting quick keyboard strokes in a split second.  Plus, this strategy guide does not bother mentioning to the reader that a critical file needed to play the game does not automatically place itself into the correct folder during install.  It has to be manually copied from the CD onto your hard drive.  Why such a bug is in the game to begin with and why the strategy guide doesn't bother mentioning the problem it is beyond understanding.	1998-06-28

Having once been a Civil War reenactor myself (Yankee) I quit the &quot;hobby&quot; almost a decade ago after having had just about enough of the egos, the political infighting, and the &quot;farbs.&quot;  I wanted nothing more to do with the Civil War because it became such an addiction for me that my personal and professional life suffered.  Unfortunately, there is no Betty Ford Clinic for the Recovering Reenactor and I had to undergo years of cold-turkey withdrawl from my Civil War addiction.   If Horwitz' book had been available to me then, I would have come to terms with my history obsession much easier.  Although I didn't care for the tiresome and ultra-politically correct &quot;hate thy white self&quot; undertone of the book, I found it mostly a humoress read that brought back a lot of memories from my time in the &quot;war.&quot; Reading it has allowed me finally make peace with my obsessional past and I highly recommend anyone interested in becoming a reenactor to delve into this book first before taking the plunge.  No, it won't turn you off on the Civil War or reenacting, but it will help you keep it all in a healthy perspective and hopefully prevent it from sucking your soul away.	1998-06-25

I give Kantor's writting 5 stars.  But the current publisher's inability or unwillingness to secure the rights to McKay's illustrations earns a big fat 1 star.	1998-06-21

The author's  descriptions of New York City evoke the mood of that town to the point of elevating this novel to the status of great literature.  Is it a dectective novel?  Not exactly.  Is it a mystery?  No, not exaclty, and yet it is both and more.  A dark, and brooding story written in the first person, &quot;Manhatten Nocturne&quot; is a compelling book, not for prudes or the faith of heart.  A gritty, tough, and at times sad novel about love, death, hate and everything that makes Manhatten what it is.	1998-06-21

This delightfull and wicked first person narrative of a young college girl's descent into prostitution in New York City would surely get Twain's satiric toes tapping if he were alive to read it.  The low-key, matter-of-fact black humor in this book forms a constant and unrelenting rythem as narrator Bennington Bloom sinks farther and farther into depravity.  But you just can't help smiling at her irony as her life unravels.  A top notch novel by a young author wiser than her years.	1998-06-21

Now, after reading their summary of Moby-Dick, I understand why.  The number of mistakes in this pamphlet are astonding.  For example, in the &quot;Synopsis of Moby-Dick,&quot; beginning on page 10, we see the following statement:  &quot;Ishmael, an islander of Massachusetts, succumbs to the urge to go to sea...&quot;  Islander of Massachusetts?  Since when?  Melville's book clearly states that Ishmael is from Manhattoes.  Manhattoes is just another name for Manhatten Island, as in NEW YORK CITY!  Last I checked New York City is in New York State, not Massachucetts.  This is only the first in a long list of errors of fact and interpretation that riddle this boiled down excuse for a companion guide to one of the greatest books ever written.  You're better off reading a comic book or children's edition of Moby-Dick if you can't handle reading the original text itself.  Cliff's Notes on Moby-Dick is just going to lead the student down the merry path to an &quot;F&quot; on their report card.	1998-06-21

But I wish Shaara had not made his first novel cover a period of several years.  The book's pace is rather choppy, but its made up for with the excellent characterizations, especially that of Stonewall Jackson.  The character of Hancock is rather disappointing.  Maybe Jeff's father sensed that Hancock wouldn't make a good fictional character and that's why he didn't make him a major figure in &quot;The Killer Angels.&quot;  &quot;Gods &amp; Generals&quot; would have gotten a lot closer to &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; had Shaara only focused on the battle of Chancellorsville over a period of several days instead of trying to cover a period of several years leading up to and into the war.  While reading it I kept thinking... OK, lets go, lets go, get on with the show!  Still, its one of the best Civil War novels written and not to missed by those interested in the subject matter.	1998-06-20

It's a wonder how Harry Turtledove has managed to carve out such a lucrative career for himslef by writting &quot;alternative history&quot; novels.  Not that the premise is bad, it certainly suckered me into buying this book, but Turledove's writting style could use a hefty dose of caffine.  Page after page after page of boring minutia about &quot;what might have been&quot; does not make a very entertaining read.  Perhaps the title of his latest book &quot;How Few Remain&quot; is significant. Turtledove may actually be telling his readers that few of these dull alternative history books remain in his head to be written.  If that's the case, the trees in the forest will rejoice at not having to be cut down anymore to be turned into paper that will be wasted on another one of  Turtledove's bogus history novels.	1998-06-20

If you're wondering which book is #2, this is it. McKinlay Kantor's haunting fictional book about the very real Andersonville prison camp is a masterpiece and well deserved the Pulitzer Prize it received. But, unlike \\"The Killer Angels,\\" \\"Andersonville\\" is a very long and at times difficult book to read. Kantor employs an unusual writing style by not using quotation marks around the spoken sentences of the charactors. This is a bit disconcerting to the reader at first, but as the story progresses one realizes it contributes greatly to the other-worldly, dream-like \\"feel\\" of the book.	1998-06-16

Editor James M. McPherson glowingly sings the praises of Frank Wilkerson's manuscript, but he provides no additional details about the life of Wilkerson, something Civil War readers have come to expect when a veteran's manuscript is reprinted.   The book is an incredible read, but the reader can't help but ask the question:  who was Frank Wilkerson?  Where is he buried?  What additional details are known about the artillery battery he served in?   What was the reaction of readers and veterans when Wilkerson's book was first published? McPherson answers none of these questions in his brief introduction.  He only points out that Wilkerson made some mistakes and a few exaggerations in the book, and that historians often quote heavily from it, but that's all.<br />The title of the book was originally: &quot;Recollections of a Private Soldier in the Army of the Potomac,&quot; but the publishers, or McPherson himself, have lamely retitled it &quot;Turned Inside Out&quot; - an obscure reference to the pockets of the battlefield dead after they had been looted.  I can understand their reasoning for giving the book a shorter and catchier title, but one wonders why they simply didn't shorten Wilkerson's original title to just &quot;A Private Soldier.&quot;  That would still describe the book in a  nutshell.  Unfortunaley, the new and enigmatic title will doom this edition to obscurity on the bookstore rack. <br />Wilkerson's narrative is wonderful and I highly recommend it for all types of readers.  But the definative edition of his narrative is yet to be published.  I give Wilkerson's narrative 5 stars. I give McPherson's lazy and disappointing scholarship 1 star.	1998-06-16

For the next two decades this massive volume was found under many Christmas trees. This new &quot;remake&quot; lacks one of the key ingredients that made the original a trully remarkable book: modern-day photographs of the battlefields. Because of the now well-publisized threat to historic battlefields by modern development, and James McPherson's pro-preservation involvement in that cause, I was stunned to see NO photographs of the battlefields to complement the text as in the original. It was those photographs that really brought the war alive for many people in their younger years and its a great disappointment to see they have been completely removed for this new volume. If for nothing else, the original volume provided a dramatic record of how the battlefields looked at their centennial in the 1960's. This new edition could have done the same for the end of the 20th century, because there have been many changes, good and bad, at these sites in the intervening 40 years. But the current publishers obviously lacked any real vision for this re-issue by not sending out photographers to provide updated views. Look through used bookstores for the original volume and forget about this lackluster &quot;remake.&quot;	1998-06-15

You won't.  And this is something that Jeff himself admits.  But &quot;The Last Full Measure&quot; comes much closer to the spirit of his father's Pulitizer Prize winning novel than &quot;Gods &amp; Generals&quot; did.  This book is darker, gloomier and bloodier than G&amp;G, or even KA for that matter. And therein lies its greatest strength.  It is also structured much differently than G&amp;G with fewer main characters and more time spent on the front lines in the heat of combat.   Just as the style of combat has changed during these last two years of the war, the charactors have  changing too.  Lee has grown mentally stronger, physically weaker, but much angrier and less patient with bungling subordinates.  Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain seems to have  discarded his idealism for a far more realistic fatalism.  And Jeff has fleshed out the &quot;new&quot; character of General Ulysses S. Grant in grand fashion, making him much more human, caring, and yes, lovable. The &quot;butcher&quot; from Galena has never been more honestly portrayed in a work of ficiton.  My only regret is that &quot;Gods &amp; Generals&quot; will be made into a movie long before &quot;Last Full Measure.&quot;  This is definately the superior story of the two.  I can hardly wait to read Jeff's next novel, which will again bring back many of these fascinating people in their younger years during the Mexican War.	1998-06-13

I must admit the premise of this book is facsinating, but the excess detail Turtledove goes into slows the pace down to a glacial crawl.  I found my self skipping entire sections, mostly the battle descriptions.  There is nothing really compelling or interesting about reading how Confederate soldiers blast the Union Army apart with modern AK-47's.  The entire book is a forgone conclusion before you get three chapters into it.	1998-06-08

A wounded veteran from Vietnam, Coco obviously has a few lingering issues to work out, but he should have done so with his therapist and not in the pages of this book. One wonders why if he is so anti-war he writes about the Civil War at all. Perhaps he feels guilty about his own morbid fascination with the most gruesome aspects of Gettysburg. After a while the reader wishes that the author would get off his soapbox and just report the facts.	1998-06-04

I first read Peter Benchley's \\"Jaws\\" back in the 1970's, several month before the movie was released. The story gripped me at that time and I still find myself re-reading the book every few years. I like the movie also, but the book is a far different experience. All the basic characters and plot are in the movie, but the book has a vastly different pace and an a rather enigmatic ending that may confuse readers. The central portion of the book involves a love affair between oceanographer Matt Hooper and Chief Brody's wife and you'll wonder what this has to do with the shark, but keep reading. This is a mini morality play in the making. If you can keep an open mind you might notice that this story is far more realistic. The shark is slightly smaller, less acrobatic and not as vicious as its film version. And if the ending puzzles you, then re-read the book's first paragraph. It hints at what really happens to the shark in the end.	1998-04-18

This was my first reading experience with Hagberg, and after finishing it I couldn't wait to tackle some of his earlier novels.  Unfortunately, they just didn't appeal to me in quite the same way.  So I look forward to Hagberg's next adventure, because if &quot;High Flight&quot; is any indication, he's improving as a good story teller.	1998-04-18

He became famous, a bit rich, and unfortunately bought a typwriter to compose &quot;Banco,&quot; the story of what he did after becoming a free man.  While not expecting the same amount of adversity that made &quot;Papillon&quot; such a great read , I feel this post-prison story suffers mostly from having been composed in a different way.  The prose doesn't flow from Charriere's typewriter in the same easy-going style as it did from his pencil in the previous book.  Still a &quot;must-read&quot; for anyone who absolutely has to know what happened next, &quot;Banco&quot; will only leave you a bit deflated and yearning to re-read &quot;Papillon&quot; again.	1998-04-18

If Tom Clancey wrote Civil War history, &quot;Monitor&quot; would be the result.  Although non-fiction, this is as exciting a read as &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; would be if it were set during the Civil War.   Military techno fans unfamiliar with the subject will be fascinated by how advanced and visionary the &quot;cheesebox on a raft&quot; was, and they won't ever look at mid-19th century technology as being quite so archaic again. For those familiar with the subject, you might find a more detailed and scholarly book about the Monitor elsewhere,  but it certainly won't be as enjoyable to read.  This is the kind of book that got you hooked on Civil War history in the first place, and deKay is to be applauded for reviving the clear prose-poetry style of the late, great Bruce Catton.	1998-04-18

Like many people who tackled it with an open mind, I loved it.  But the first time reader who approaches it without warning will often abandon ship before they get very far on the voyage.  Its easy for readers of modern fiction to make the relativily easy transition to the 19th Century literature of Mark Twain or Charles Dickens, but woe unto them who are unprepared to navigate the rocks and shoals of Melville's oceans!  To appreciate Moby-Dick you must love the English language with a passion, for no other book demostrates better what can be done with it.  Moby-Dick contains an ocean of ideas, many of them so subtle you won't see them on a first time reading. So, plan you voyage carefully, or else you might get stove in by Melville's whale and abandon the hunt for truth and beauty far too early.	1998-04-01
