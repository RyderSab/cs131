In this engrossing novel based on the life of middle weight boxing champion Stanley Ketchel the Ragtime era of the early 1900's is brought vividly to life. The story begins with Ketchel running away from home and riding the rails as a teen-aged hobo after a fight with his step father which he believes has resulted in his death. It progresses smoothly into his discovery as a boxing prospect while working as a bouncer in a saloon out West. It then chronicles his rise and astonishing record of wins and K.O.'s both in and out of his weight class. The descriptions of the fights are edge-of-your-seat exciting and gory in places. His womanizing ways are also marvelously and entertainingly evoked. The dialogue is crisp, realistic, and humorous throughout which is one of this author's major strengths along with painting a vivid picture of that time period. Boxing fans and readers who like historical/biographical novels will really get their money's worth out of this book!	2005-10-10

In this practical how-to guide author and long-time treasure hunter Michael Chaplan really delivers the goods. Everything from choosing a metal detector, researching a site, hunting tips and blending into various city environments are covered. One major point that is emphasized over and over again is the fact that \\"treasure\\" can take many forms and be found in many places from the attic to your local park etc. The book advises the reader to be creative when approaching a site both in your research and out in the field. For example, maybe a vacant lot was once a fairgrounds with heavy traffic and presumably lots of lost coins. It also clears up many misconceptions people have of treasure hunting and it's enthusiasts. Drawing on some of his own many adventures, the author draws the reader closer into this fascinating hobby. The text is laced with stories/examples that are entertaining and motivating as well as very practical.	2005-09-22

Veteran 'Sports Illustrated' writer Rick Reilly takes the reader on a light-hearted journey through the world of caddying. He caddies for a diverse bunch both on the pro tours and off including; Donald Trump, Deepak Chopra, Casey Martin and a golf hustler named Dewey Tomko to name only a few. In a witty and acerbic style of writing Reilly familiarizes the reader with all the many aspects of what it takes to be a successful caddy. Something that he laughingly and demonstrably admits that he wasn't. In the process the personalities of these various celebrities (and lesser knowns) are revealed through their rounds with Reilly on the bag. If you're looking for a serious golf read then this book is probably not for you. On the other hand, if 'Caddyshack' happens to be one of your all-time favorite comedies, don't waste any more time reading this review --- get your hands on a copy of 'Who's Your Caddy?'	2005-09-03

In this highly readable book, Frank \\"The Irishman\\" Sheeran reveals his long life of crime as an associate of the mafia. While not a full-fledged member (being Irish), he was a well-respected and very active associate of various crime bosses like Russell Bufalino performing such duties as \\"painting houses\\" --- killing a man. Most notably (and worth the read alone) is his account of how on July 30th 1975 he helped kidnap under pretenses of a mob \\"sit down\\" meeting and shoot his friend Jimmy Hoffa. It seems the mob didn't want Hoffa running for Teamsters president again after his release from jail due to their cozy relationship with his replacement Frank Fitzsimmons. Forget all those crazy stories about how his body was put in an oil drum and buried in the end zone of Giant's Stadium in NJ. Long an FBI suspect in the case, Sheeran along with others like mob boss Salvatore \\"Sally Bugs\\" Briguglio and Hoffa stepson Chuckie O'Brien all played a role in his disappearance and murder. According to Sheeran, he shot him in the head twice and his body was taken from the prearranged safe house to a local meat packing plant and incinerated not far from where he was picked up at the Machus Red Fox Restaraunt outside Detroit. The who's, why's and how's all seem to fit with the known last day of Hoffa which makes this account --- unlike so many others --- credible and believable at every turn of scrutiny. Sheeran's career as a mafia hit man and his seeming indifference to it all is truly chilling!	2005-08-27

So many books have been written about the CIA and FBI over the years. Many of them are by people with an axe to grind, interests/agendas to serve, and or secrets to protect. This book by former high-ranking KGB officer Victor Cherkashin breaks that mold. In it he details his 40-year distinguised career with the KGB including the \\"highlights\\" of his recruitment & handling of the two most damaging spies in U.S. history --- Aldrich Ames of the CIA and Robert Hanssen of the FBI. He clears up a lot of the myths that both were inept bumblers and rates both highly as spying professionals. He also makes clear that both of them were not caught by any great efforts of either the CIA or FBI, but were simply informed on by Russian agents out in the field.  <br />Interestingly, he clears up a lot of the misconceptions about the height of cold war spying in the 80's between the U.S. and Russia. Mainly that a lot of the spying that went on was almost like a game between the two countries with little of National security importance on the line. He portrays it as the old \\"I know something you don't know.\\" game playing out on an international scale like a competition for information. <br />At the end of the book he gives a very valid and timely assessment about the current world intelligence situation, Iraq and terrorism. He argues very convincingly that the Bush administration along with the CIA was well-aware that Iraq had no WMD before the war. Also that the CIA and George Tenet were used as a political tool and later a scapegoat to advance the real reason behind the war --- OIL. He describes the Bush administrations' later spinning of the war --- Operation Iraqi Freedom as \\"laughable.\\" His other main arguement is that intelligence all over the world has gotten too big and too self-important for its own good (probably true). <br />The reader is given an honest matter-of-fact account of spying in the past, present, and future by someone intimately familiar with what is at stake. It's more than a little ironic that we as Americans can read about all this in 'Spy Handler' by someone who was considered a former enemy.	2005-03-08

A lot has been written on the search for the legendary treasure galleon 'Atocha.' Unfortunately, not much of it makes for very entertaining reading. Too many writers have taken a great story of persistence, tragedy and faith and turned it into a clinical and boring historical tome. This book however by Jedwin Smith is a great look at Mel Fisher and his 16-year quest to find the mother lode. The author helped dive on the wreck numerous times starting in May 1985 and then several years later. It is this intimate familiarity with the cast involved that brings the story closer to home for the reader. <br />Mel Fisher is profiled here in all his larger-than-life glory; huckster to his investors, devoted father to his family, and dreamer extraordinaire. Beyond just the glory of July 20, 1985 when his divers uncovered the bulk of his $400 million dollar prize, we learn of all the tragedies that led up to that moment. From the loss of his eldest son, daughter-in-law and another diver in a boating accident ten years to the day before. To the loss of others involved in the 16-year search along the way. It also becomes obvious to the reader that Mel uncovered A LOT of \\"dry holes\\" off of Key West over the years in his long and arduous search. Frustration and utter despair would've crushed most treasure hunters. And where those failed, a collapse in the financing would've taken over, but Mel Fisher is portrayed as a forever optimist with his famous saying: \\"Today's the day.\\" <br />It is easy to see from 'Fatal Treasure' how his infectious dream and optimism motivated others to help him in his ultimately successful quest. Great annecdotes are also provided here by the author including one about how Jimmy Buffett came aboard Mel's boat the day of the big find to perform 'A Pirate Looks At Forty.' He (Fisher) was  named 'President in Perpetuity of Key West' because he so embodied the laid back, drop out of the rat race lifestyle. A little known fact presented is that the author's brother along with Fisher's son Kim and others have continued the quest for the even richer stern section of the ship right up into the present day. Although the pictures in this book are in black and white, the reader gets a good feel for the massive amount of gold, silver and emeralds found. It is over-the-top with regard to bringing this fascinating true adventure to life!	2005-03-04

First and foremost, this book is more of a literary and investigative adventure. It's not until the last chapter that the author actually details his own physical search for the fabled  treasure in Ecuador of the Incan King Atahualpa. A treasure that by all accounts over the last 500 years may be the most valuable land cache of gold and other precious objects on earth. It provides interesting and entertaining background on the other treasure hunters and explorers who went before him on the search. This leads the reader through labrynthine twists of misinformation, questionable documents/maps and several \\"characters\\" the author encounters who come across as gold-crazed swashbucklers. The book is definitely well-researched, but I expected something more along the lines of an Indiana Jones type of real-life adventure and came away with something more along the lines of a day spent in a musty-smelling library....	2005-02-16

Kip Wagner was a full-time contractor and part-time dreamer on Florida's east coast. Walking along the beach one day near his home in Wabasso, a friend found him some silver coins (oxidized to black) after bragging about finding them washed ashore all the time. This set in motion years of research by Kip and his treasure/business partners regarding the 1715 Spanish Plate Fleet of ships lost in a hurricane during July of that year. This historical event is well-chronicled here too.  <br />They hit pay dirt after years of diving, research and hard work finding thousands of gold & silver coins, bars and jewelry making themselves millionaires in the process. One chapter describes sand being mechanically blown away from an area of the sea bed which revealed according to Kip a \\"carpet of gold.\\" It's this along with other descriptions (And great pictures of the finds too!) told in a down-home sort of way that makes this book such a fun and breezy read. If this story doesn't stir your blood with a sense of adventure, then try the fictional 'Treasure Island' or something.

Judge Joseph Crater is arguably the most famous missing person in American history. Since he disappeared from a Manhattan restaurant on the night of August 6, 1930 his name has become synonomous with the missing. In this book by 'Wall Street Journal' assistant publisher Richard Tofel the Crater mystery and the New York of that era are brought vividly to life. A handsome ladies' man, clothes horse, successful attorney, recently appointed NY supreme court judge, happily married man, and wealthy theater enthusiast, he was also undoubtedly corrupt. Bribes, graft, and payoffs were commonplace in the Tammany Hall political machine of his time as detailed at length in these pages. Although he was a well-known political figure, his real claim to fame came as a result of his complete and utter disappearance. A case which to this day, some 74 years later, remains unsolved. Because of his shady dealings, womanizing and other nefarious political connections, the theories advanced over the years would require another much larger book all on their own. Did he run away with a showgirl he'd been seen with? Was he murdered by mobsters? Did he join a monastery? These are only a few of the possible answers and part of the fun and intrigue is that the reader is left to guess for themselves.	2004-10-12

Besides being well over six feet tall, Jack Molinas stood above the basketball competition he faced in other ways. His I.Q. was a whopping 175 and he used his native itelligence and skills on the court to fix college games for Columbia during the 50's. Later on, he was suspended from the N.B.A in his rookie season for working the same scams there. The culmination came with the basketball scandals of the early 60's and his arrest and subsequent five-year prison sentence. After leaving the 'big house' he turned his talents to upholding the law by becoming a renowned lawyer. He had spent his life manipulating and lying to people so it seemed a natural fit that he eventually moved to California with a girl friend and became a porn producer. Ultimately, his mob ties from his fix days and shady connections caught up with him however. Apparently, he had welshed on sports bets to bookies connected with La Cosa Nostra. Obviously, a very dumb thing to do for someone gifted with his level of intelligence. He was shot by unknown assailents in his home in 1974. Clearly, out of all the people he cheated in his life, the author of this book makes very clear that the person he ultimately short-changed the most was himself.	2004-08-21

Technically and intellectually speaking, Thomas Pynchon is a very skilled writer. His prose is deep, detailed, wry, and encyclopedic all in the same vein. The problem is, he also happens to be a very boring and lackluster storyteller. In 'Mason &amp; Dixon' there is a lot of the wry humor Pynchon has founded his long and eccentric career on. The downside is, for every great page of writing, you have to encounter a hundred other pages which drag on with trite and seemingly unneccessary filler. Pynchon is alot like James Joyce in the sense that you either get him or you don't and you either enjoy his often difficult stream-of-conciousness style or you don't. There's no in-between when it comes to any of his few books. If you're looking for something to read by him because you've heard that he's one of the most famous literary eccentrics since J.D.

These shortcomings were all contributing causes of his untimely demise at the hands of his girlfriend Sandy Murphy and her new lover Rick Tabish. The book covers many aspects of their relationship and scheming plans to murder Binion so they could share in his wealth. Most of the other fascinating details of the case were simply not covered by programs like 'Dateline', '20/20', 'Court T.V.' etc which is what makes this book so thorough and interesting. Buried treasure, wild characters, sex, murder and betrayal --- this is one story that like it's unfortunate victim had it all. Interesting developments have happened since the book's release in late 2001. Namely, Tabish and Murphy's murder convictions were overturned due to a technicality involving a separate torture case for which Tabish is still serving time. Murphy is now free and both are awaiting a retrial set for sometime in October of '04. Additionally, the 'Binion's Horseshoe' casino a Las Vegas landmark for 50+ years, was recently closed down for violations involving owed back pay. I can only hope that author Jeff German will take up the pen again when the aftermath of the new trial has settled.	2004-03-02

In 'Handsome Harry', author James Carlos Blake captures the voice of bank robber Harry Pierpont in the same way that J.D. Salinger captured the voice of an angsty teenager in 'The Catcher in the Rye'--- BELIEVABLY &amp; SMOOTHLY. This boldly honest first person narrated novel takes actual events of the great depression years of the 30's and gives a novelistic flair and panache to the way it was running with the John Dillinger gang. Robbing banks and staying one step ahead of the law as we know is a very dangerous profession. This novel puts you right there in the center of the action with hot dames, expensive suits, and bullets screaming from a Tommy gun!	2004-02-29

Want an up close and personal look at what it was like in the Vietnam war and during that whole era? If so, then look no further than this book by Tim O'Brien. His collection of short stories does for the Vietnam conflict what James Joyce's 'Dubliners'does for turn-of-the-century Dublin, Ireland. Through a series of skillful vignettes, O'Brien paints a picture that is as gritty as it is gripping of his experiences in Vietnam as a young soldier. While he has admitted that some of this stuff never actually happened to him, he weaves these short masterpieces so that you could never tell what is fact and what is fiction --- similar to many myths about that war which are etched deeply into our American psyche to this day....I've read most of Hemingway's war stuff and with apologies to that great writer, nothing other than his short story 'Blackass at the Crossroads' comes even close to putting the reader right there seemingly in the middle of the action as O'Brien's book does. If you liked the movie 'Platoon' then you'll definitely enjoy this highly-charged piece of work!	2004-02-14

Josh Gibson was known as &quot;the black Babe Ruth.&quot; In his day, he towered over the other batting talent in the negro leagues like a colossus. Legend has it that he hit more than 800 homeruns including the longest one out of Yankee stadium ever recorded. Because of the color barrier, he never made it to &quot;the bigs&quot; and died just three months before Jackie Robinson broke through. Sadly, he remains a footnote in sports history known mostly to true baseball afficianados.  However, thanks to this book by Mark Ribowsky, he will never be forgotten and will always be accessible to those interested enough to read it. Like the jazz musician Charlie Parker, he was a womanizing drug abuser who died in his mid-thirties. Both men died long before their immense talent ever had the chance to fade away. They also represented two of America's greatest inventions --- baseball and jazz with incredible style and poise. Interesting details here about Josh's time in the South American leagues fill in gaps in his career record. Poignant insight is also presented about the loss of his first wife which set the stage for his depression, self-abuse and eventual downfall. No less an authority than baseball's greatest hitter Ted Williams used his 1966 Baseball Hall of Fame induction speech to praise both Gibson and his pitching counterpart Satchel Paige lobbying for them to be inducted into the hall which they both eventually were. Details, annecdotes and great insights into a great player abound in this book. The writing here by Ribowsky is definitely worthy of his subject.	2004-02-05

A golf writing double-eagle**	Let me say this up front --- Tom Callahan is an immensely gifted writer. He is able through words to take the trite/boring and turn it into the phenomenally sublime. With an encyclopedic knowlege of all things golf along with up-close-and-personal profiles of current &amp; past players, coaches, and associated fathers, he paints through annecdotes a circular, but no less complete picture of Tiger and his place in the great game of golf. This book is NOT per-se, a purely biographical sketch of Tiger Woods, but more of a wholistic and entertaining presentation of the past, present and future of the game and Tiger's place in it. If you love golf, watch golf, and love to read, you'll get more &quot;bang for your buck&quot; here than any other golf book I know of! And I've read quite a few....	2004-01-29

Having gone to high school in the town where this took place, it was truly surreal reading Maurice Possley's book. His detailed and absorbing account of this tragedy however, would make anyone feel close to the subject.... Palatine, IL is as just as it's described here --- a sleepy, affluent suburb of Chicago where the mass murder of seven people would seem as out of place as Swedish models found living on Mars. What was less surprising to me though was the gross arrogance and total incompetence of the Palatine police department described here at length. Having gotten my share of speeding tickets, I had lots of first-hand experience with some of the officers associated with Palatine's P.D. No hard feelings because I was in the wrong, but I began to see how they were just generating money for the department through &quot;speeding revenue&quot;. The sad part is, if they'd spent less time stopping guys like me for doing 10 miles an hour over the limit, they may have solved this case much quicker than the 9 years it actually took them! The really important thing though is obviously that these two killers were eventually called to justice to account for their horrific crimes. Although it was someone &quot;dropping the dime&quot; on the killers rather than good old fashioned police work, the families of the victims now have some closure to this terrible event. What's really disturbing, is that the two perps were only in their late teens, did this purely for the thrill, and managed to evade capture for so long! This is definitely a true crime book that fans of this genre will be raving about for years to come.	2004-01-24

Something about lost treasure just grabs ahold of my attention like no other non-fiction subject. This book is chock-full of such tales and can be read for the entertainment value or as a how to/where to guide for treasure hunting enthusiasts. The only real downfall is that there's no bibliography so you can follow-up the leads and expand your knowledge base. This would also help give more credibility to some of the obscure leads Yenne provides.

Anytime a book gets as much attention as 'The DaVinci Code', I feel compelled to read it. I think the real reason this book has taken off like wildfire is that most people AREN'T familiar with 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail'. This is a historically researched book dealing with the same subjects which Dan Brown basically pirated for his novel. The difference between them is, that truth in this case is stranger and MORE interesting than fiction. The characters in 'The DaVinci Code' were wooden, the plotlines about Opus Dei were awkward, and Dan Brown has an EXTREMELY ANNOYING habit of making every other sentence an italicized thought! It got really cumbersome when I first started reading the novel and became more and more cartoon-like until I gratefully reached page 454.... Another historical book dealing with the same subject matter is called 'Rennes La Chateau' and again the true subject of Berenger Saunier --- a priest who found a mysterious treasure in southern France using clues found in the paintings of Poussin is worlds more interesting and engrossing than Brown's flimsy fictional attempt at it's exploitation.	2004-01-15

Don Simpson lived much larger than life. His monthly narcotics bills (both prescription and illegal) along with his patronizing of high-priced escorts via Heidi Fleiss would put the national debt of some small countries to shame! This is a really juicy, tabloid-like expose of someone who in his day was the undisputed king of Hollywood's bad boys. Beyond all the sensationalism though, is a presentation of his and his partner Jerry Bruckheimer's many successful film collaborations. They were the dynamic duo behind such 1980's hit movies as; 'Beverly Hills Cop', 'Top Gun', 'Flashdance' and many others. The reader gets a genuine feel of what goes into movie-making behind the scenes that we as viewers tend to take for granted. As a producer of money-making movies during the 80's, Don Simpson had no equal. Like many men of his stripe however, he also suffered from narciscism, a lack of personal discipline, and a laundry list of excesses which eventually destroyed him. Similar to Elvis Presley, he was found dead in his bathroom of what was reported to the press as a heart attack. What these sources failed to disclose was that his system was completely overloaded at the time with a variety of different drugs to which he'd become dependent. His is a cautionary tale of Hollywood that gets repeated generation after generation with a cliche-like regularity. Nonetheless, his flaws are what make this biography so damned interesting to read!	2003-12-08

If Howard Jennings wasn't George Lucas's inspiration for the Indiana Jones movies, he very well could've been. This book documented by one of his treasure hunting cronies gives novelistic descriptions of everything from found pirate hoards to emerald gems discovered in South America by Jennings. Seems both the author and this modern-day swashbuckler were also first-rate ladies men throughout their years of treasure hunting adventures together which adds even more spice to the true tales. Danger, intrigue and adventure are the key elements of this book whether you're a treasure hunting couch potato or a serious treasure hunter yourself. Practical advice abounds and the book even closes with some known and not so well known sites for aspirants to follow the leads of. While this book is out of print, the good news is that several cheap copies are available online at places like abebooks.com.

With kernals of wisdom like: \\"What is essential is invisible\\", it touches the very soul of the reader. Antoine de Saint-Exupery has become something of a literary saint due to the enduring popularity of this work.

If you love satire, larger than life characters, and need a good laugh--- this book is definitely for you. Ignatius Reilly is an overweight, lazy, super-smart 30 year old who still lives with his mother. His adventures in the world of work are what drives this novel along with his philosophies of life (what he refers to as his \\"world view\\") which are nothing short of hilarious! To say that he is one of funniest characters in all of modern literature would be a gross understatement. Part Don Quixote and part Falstaff, the fun never stops as he makes his way through New Orleans low society. This book won the author a posthumous pultizer prize for literature in 1981. Sadly, the author committed suicide in 1969 after failing to get it published during his lifetime. Thankfully, his mother discovered the manuscript and as they say the rest is history. I've read an awful lot of books in my time and this one remains my far and away favorite. Discover for yourself what makes 'A Confederacy of Dunces' so off-the-wall good.

The latter is the story of a nobody, forty-something anyman from France whose life changes completely after a visit to Thailand. It explores the seediness of the sex tourism industry there with a boldly philosophical honesty that is truly refreshing. Pornographic in passages and poetic in others, this book keeps your attention from the first page until the very last. Ultimately, it is a story of degredation and the  fall from lazy unconcerned wealth into self-destructive debauchery. The ending is a strangely unexpected one that leaves the reader shaking their head. The quality of the writing is first-rate from character development to setting and place. This lends great credibility to a storyline that is enjoyable and engrossing. Single men will especially enjoy the take on the state of modern relationships between men and women here in the Western world. Through this, the author makes a strong case for Western men to see the value of Asian women as sex and long-term partners. It's been a long time since I've read a current novel that packed this much punch!	2003-08-15

Part owner of the Las Vegas Casino--- 'Binion's Horseshoe', he lived much larger than life. That is until he was (most likely) murdered by his beautiful live-in girlfriend Sandy Murphy and her conspiring lover Rick Tabish. Both are now doing bids of 20 to life pending a possible reopening of their case. Unfortunately, the above book doesn't do his tantalizing story justice. His is a cautionary tale about heroine addiction, immense wealth, fast women and shady characters. It includes buried treasure, hard partying and other vices that make eccentric people like him endlessly fascinating. This book however is too short, and honestly reads like what it is--- a compilation of newspaper articles put together by two journalists desperate to quickly cash in on a legend. For all appearances (too many pictures &amp; not enough prose) it looks and reads like something thrown together on the way over to the local Kinko's Copies! It's truly unfortunate because there's enough intrigue in Ted Binion's life and controversial death for a book ten times the size of this one.	2003-08-03

I've been a golfer now for 12 years and a serious reader for even longer. Having devoured books like 'The Legend of Bagger Vance', 'Golf in the Kingdom' and others, the golf/mysticism genre is one that seems to grow stronger and better all the time. Dr. Chopra's book 'Golf for Enlightenment' is another one in this long line of greats. Taking the now popular stance that golf is truly a metaphor for life, he gives us a mystical novel with after chapter commentary on how that segment applied to the game and to life. Think of it as a seven-step program to freedom and enlightenment through the game of golf. I can say with complete honesty that golf has positively changed my life in so many ways. This is why it's so refreshing to read an entertaining story of how it has shaped other people's lives as well. The book is also a very quick read which will leave you imagining the possibilities of your next round. If you love golf and can't get enough of it's endless mysteries and riddles, then this book is definitely for you!	2003-08-02

Frank Morris was literally a genius and he and the Anglin brothers successfully? busted out of the most famous &quot;escape proof prison&quot; of them all. From details like his nicknames in prison: &quot;Frankie&quot; and &quot;Ace&quot; we also learn about who was on guard that night and various lapses on the part of the prison staff which lead up to the breakout. In addition, there are many never before published photos of the island and principals involved. The author was a little girl living on the island at the time and gives other tidbits about life there for both the staff and prisoners. While her opinion is that the &quot;Tablespoon Trio&quot; did not make it, she also leaves the door cracked open for the reader to draw their own conclusions.

Given Hemingway's giant reputation in the world of literature, it's amazing it took more than 20 years after his death for a book about his views on writing to emerge. Culled from personal letters, his novels, and interviews this short read splices together a thorough picture of his writing style and philosophy. Imagine being at your computer and having Hemingway himself looking over your shoulder guiding you and that's basically what this book can do. Seems like so many famous current authors try to get even richer (like Stephen King's 'On Writing') by espousing their views in books on writing. Hemingway on the other hand obviously had no urge to profit from like-minded books or he would've done so during his lifetime. This makes his observations seem all the more valid and genuine. I found his superstitions about discussing your works in progress to be very intuitive. Clearly, there is a wealth of information on all aspects of writing here making this well worth the read to both established and aspiring authors alike.	2003-03-26

In this fascinating account of Hitler's obsession with grail lore, the occult and and Wagnerian opera, we learn about his crucial but 'lost years' in Vienna, Austria. During this time he was a homeless artist who read extensively and subsisted by selling water color postcards of famous landmarks on the street. The book by Ravenscroft was made possible because of a friendship between the author and a professor of economics who befriended Hitler and was subjected to his visionary tirades on politics during this time around 1912-13. What we discover is a deep understanding on the part of Hitler of the powers associated with black magic and the occult. The legend of the spear of destiny used by the Roman soldier Longinus to pierce the side of Christ is the centerpiece of the story. How it inspired Hitler, provided psychic glimpses for him into the future and how it ultimately allowed him to carry out his twisted mission of genocide and world conquest (though he failed in the latter). Despite what you may feel about him and his actions, no one can deny that he was an incredibly interesting and ambitious man. Through shear will and determination he rose from abject poverty to undisputed leader of a great world power. Ironically, we learn that when the spear fell into American hands in April 1945 and Berlin was under siege, Hitler and his bride Eva Braun committed suicide on Walpurgis Night--- a satanic holiday. This book truly explains the WHO and the HOW behind the WHY of WWII and the background it provides is thorough, well-documented and frankly very entertaining and compelling. Given all the movies about Hitler and WWII, it amazes me that noone has tried to make a movie based around this book. The movie 'Max' was a very weak and thinly disguised attempt but fell short on many levels. Check this little known gem out today.	2003-03-18

As anyone who is serious about golf knows, the game is 90% mental. Renowned teaching professional John Andrisani draws on interviews with Tiger's Mom, Dad, ex-coaches, and current one Butch Harmon to piece together what tips have made him into perhaps the greatest player the game will ever know. That being said, anyone who wants to improve at golf NEEDS to read this book. Lessons with pros are fine, IF you have unlimited time and money to pursue them. Save yourself both strokes on the course,  grief, and money by getting a hold of this book! One of the most impressive aspects of 'Think Like Tiger' is the tips Butch Harmon learned from one of golf's other all-time legends--- Ben Hogan which are passed on here. Additionally, it is interesting to learn that Tiger's mother Tida introduced him to Buddism which he uses to relax, calm his mind, and meditate. His father Earl also tells how he prepped Tiger on the need for ignoring all distractions etc by rattling golf clubs during his back swing and other tricks to build his total focus. There is even a claim made that Tiger saw a hypno-therapist named Dr. Jay Brunza, a former navy man to help him with his pre-shot routine. This may be speculation, but then again, it may not. After all, who could possibly completely explain Tiger's total domination of a game so fickle and capricious? In short, it's fair to warn the reader that 'The Man' himself DID NOT collaborate with Andrisani on the writing of this book. However, Adrisani's keen insigts into all aspects of the game and his other reliable sources, more than make up for this short-coming. I found this to be a short, and incredibly insightful read. If you really want to play better golf, do yourself a favor and get your hands on a copy of this book A.S.A.P!	2002-08-29

This book is like a very poetic and enchanting accident by the side of the highway, despite the fact that disaster lurks, you just can't help looking over and then being drawn in by it. Similar in narrative style to James Joyce, Malcom Lowry is more accessable and his meanings sink in more with the passage of time. It has been weeks now since I finished U.T.V, yet it keeps revealing itself and its meanings in ever more complex ways. Picture a stone thrown into a pond and the ripples circling out into infinity and you get my point. Because of the stream-of-consciousness style, it can be confusing at times. Like any great book though, patience is a virtue that is highly rewarded.

As a big fan of the 'literary lion' of the last century, I have read almost everything he wrote. This book came out 25 years after his death and shows a sensitive side to his writing never previously seen. 'The Garden of Eden' is a twisted love triangle which actually gives the women characters in it a clear voice. He was always roundly criticized for the women characters in his stories being too one-dimensional. Not the case here. He himself described this novel as \\"....the paradise a man must lose....\\" This book is so far different in every aspect from his other works that it is worth the read on that basis alone. While I never read his other post-humous work 'Islands in the Stream', I did manage to read 'True at First Light.' Unfortunately, this manuscript should've remained \\"lost.\\" It was really just a biography of one of his last African safaris with his wife Mary rather than a novel. Anyway, the twists and turns presented by the above title makes it an intriguing and quick \\"page-turner.\\" If you are a Hemingway fan, you'll love this refreshing change of pace.	2002-01-22

It is a metaphor for anything that anyone has lost and can't get back; youth, beauty, idealism etc. The only real problem with this story is that you never want it to end!	2002-01-18

This book is a well-written, funny look at the dating/mating game. While some of the &quot;techniques&quot; are completely off-the-wall, what Casanova is really trying to illustrate by some of them is that humor can go a very long way. The real Machiavelli would definitely have approved of this book since he too was a womanizer. The paradox of it is that the LESS you SEEM like the type to be using these ploys, the more successful you will be. Whether you happen to be; a veteran, a wanna-be, or a gonna-be, this book definitely says something you need to hear! True wisdom and insight scream out at you from almost every page.	2002-01-09

I've read this book twice now, yet I took something completely new away on the second reading. For my money, this book got too low of a rating on the '100 Greatest Novels of the 20th Century' list at #93. While on the bookshelf, it looks long and tedious but no book better rewards the patient reader. Surprises lurk around every turn and suspense builds to unheard of levels. If you don't come away from this one shaking your head with absolute amazement then you can't appreciate great literature. Like fine wine or great art, this book ages well.	2002-01-09

With a great and widely-read book like this one, making fresh observations is difficult. While some of the historical examples seem arcane, the basic principles expressed throughout are as true today as when the book went to press almost 500 years ago. Besides being applicable to politics, 'The Prince' can also be applied to business (especially in today's world) and even love. After all: &quot;All is fair in both love and war.&quot; Machiavelli himself was a very astute Italian politician during the Renaissance and not surprisingly, a womanizer too. He would most likely approve of the lasting popularity of his work despite the fact that during his own life, he tried to hush it up. Page for page, no book in history has said more in fewer pages. Of all the books in the elite category of &quot;Must Read&quot; this book stands out like a beacon.	2002-01-09

From what I gathered, Joyce was trying to intersperse life, death and rebirth into a mythical Irish epic. With it's obscure references, jabberwocky-like sentences and chaotic theme, he has a lot of fun keeping the reader guessing. His chief talent here is playing with words, puns, and puzzles all while trying to tell an obscure tale with no obvious plot. If you enjoy a seriously challenging read and are looking for a novel like no other give this one a try.	2001-12-23

For everyone who is a Doors fan, has read the Morrison bio 'No One Here Gets Out Alive' and loves a good story... buy this book today!!! Ray Manzarek, who probably knew Jim better than anyone being his college friend and cofounder of their wildly successful band has given us a superb first novel. He toys with the concept of Jim being still alive out there in the world. And this leads him on a journey to the Seychelles Islands in the Indian Ocean to find him. The story is moving, touching, and believable to the point that you almost wonder if Ray isn't holding out on us. In any case, the book is well-paced and beguiling the whole way through.	2001-12-21
