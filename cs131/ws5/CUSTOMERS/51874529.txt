Actions have consequences and say a lot about character.  I'm glad these brave men stepped forward, not once but twice, in service of their Nation.  What is the Kerry camp doing?  Trying to undermine the Nation, not once, but twice!  A compelling read!	2004-09-06

I picked up several useful tips in the first few minutes perusing it.  This never happens - usually I look through a PS book looking for things that I don't know already.<br />Scott Kelby doesn't waste time telling you how to take a photograph, but rather gets to the meat and potatoes of digital post processing.  This is great for me, as I need to make the most of my time and this book has helped me to do that.<br />Also, I really enjoy Mr. Kelby's writing style, and am oh-so glad that he came out with this book - it's the best thing to come along for digital photographers like myself, who have a working knowledge of PS but need to squeeze as much as possible out of the program.<br />My sincere thanks Mr. Kelby!  :-)  I love this book!	2004-05-01

This is something I'm learning to take advantage of, and can see the improvement in my pictures.<br />I was also happy to see a section added dealing with color and one on digital imaging.<br />If you've got a basic understanding of photography behind you, then I'd highly recommend this book!	2004-01-18

Wells departs from his previous occupation of writing novels based on fantasy and fabrication and turns to using the methods of science fiction and applying his projections of societal development to his stories.<br />In making his projections of what the future was to be like, Wells saw the enemy as monopolist/capitalist and portrayed them in the future as the great corporation.<br />This was the evil of capitalism, which lead Wells to conclude that the business states would take the place of what was 19th Century Governments.<br />The flaw with this in the novel is that as a result of this new type of order, individuals are victims of the category of person that fate places them in.  People are measured by their utility or lack of utility.<br />Wells' vision is repulsive rather than desirable, and it is clear that he doesn't believe in the ability of society to live up to its own ideals of equality and justice.<br />We've seen this played out on the world stage during the industrial revolution, which gave birth to the evils of communism.  Wells was a visionary, no doubt, but this story underestimates the human spirit and what happens when you combine Democracy with Capitalism!	2003-09-04

Is he the result of capitalism, using technology to gain the liberty of a higher standard of living, which it allows?  Is he despot, savior, evil or compassionate?<br />Nemo epitomizes a vision of humanity, which is arrogantly attempting to create a peaceful world through technology.  The battle is clearly in vein as the characters are hindered by the passions of their natures.<br />Nemo is the rebel, the nation-less man, who has turned away from the machine mentality, dollar diplomacy and imperialist expansionism of his age.<br />Verne creates a self-contained world for Nemo, one in which there is no dependency on capitalism.  The Nautilus produces all that Nemo needs.<br />This freedom is decadent.  The Nautilus produces no surplus value other than to provide for the whims of Nemo, a person dehumanized by the progress of the developing western world.  A world he doesn't understand or is in touch with.<br />Even in his act of political intervention against imperialism through the financing the liberation movement of the Cretans from the Turks was decadent.  The money came from the sea, it was put back into circulation, and it was not the result of production or creativity.  There is no net gain to society by this action.  Encouraging production and industry could have better provided for the people.<br />Though Nemo was creative enough to produce the Nautilus to escape his world of torment, he's nothing more that a narcissist!<br />When Nemo brings the Professor on his trip, it becomes a conquest of the sea.  Nature becomes a possession, no longer mysterious and otherworldly, but just a part of the humanized world.<br />It is Ned alone who sees the vanity of the voyage, but to no avail.  All aboard become trapped in the world of Nemo.<br />A world running from machine and science in a machine.  A world free from governments and country in which he governs.  A world free from captivity in which he holds others captive.  A world which he takes freely from, but gives nothing to in return.  Nemo is everything he disdains.<br />In making his journey of discovery around the world, Nemo fails to make the most important discovery that there is, what it means to be human!h he holds others captive.  A world which he takes freely from, but gives nothing to in return.

It's been more than one hundred years since Huck Finn was first published, since that time there's been very little improvement in man's character.<br />We still see the same things: theft, dishonesty, riots, war, slavery, child abuse, superstition, hypocrisy, murder, and fear!  Though pessimistic, Twain does see some good in man's character, just not much.<br />Since the writing of this book, we've seen the abolishment of slavery (which I think was the reason for Twain writing this story), though we are still fighting the stigma of the prejudices caused by it!<br />We've got all same character flaws, and the best we can say for ourselves is that we still have some of the same redeeming characteristics that Huck had: Loyalty, friendship, sincerity, and love.  These may not be much, but they are enough for hope for the future.<br />These are the things that can help us to grow and progress, as Huck did.  With them, we can open our eyes, and our hearts to our own weaknesses, and in so doing help us down our own rivers.<br />And who knows, perhaps in another hundred years we can look back and be proud.<br />This is the possibility that is Huck Finn!	2003-08-10

Though it's hard to feel sorry for the main character after his hand in murder, you still do, but only slightly!  After all, he did tempt fate, and fate turned on him and gave him what he, and most of the others deserved.<br />As for the writing, this book gave birth to a genre that we still enjoy today!  Hard to believe that a story with the twists and turns of this one could be told so sparcely in words, and yet be so compelling in just over 100 pages!

This is the post hippie generation coming of age!<br />And as with every generation, values and mores are part of the culture.  This story tells of the trails and tribulations of an individual faced with tragedy, the difficulty in dealing with it, and the self questioning it imposes after it is discovered there is no where to run and hide.
