My one reservation is that it seems to be trying to appeal to an international readership--all of the measures include conversions--and includes a few unfamiliar items.  What are continental sausages?  And can I really pick up a package of baby pappadams at the grocery store?  Hmmm--perhaps if I swing by London on my way home...	2005-09-23

To my surprise, the recipes use Splenda to reduce sugar, but include other ingredients such as corn syrup, brown sugar, honey, fruit juice, raisins, sweetened yogurt, candied ginger and canned fruit.  On the plus side, it does give you exchanges and a nutritional breakdown for every recipe; but I will have to keep looking for a Splenda-only cookbook.	2005-07-12

That said, many of the dishes will not appeal to the American palate, including \\"Smoked Haddock with Cream,\\" \\"Kidneys Cooked with Sherry,\\" and \\"Eggs with Meat Juices\\" (seriously).  I doubt that most Americans will end up making most of the recipes.  However, Slater does have an interesting take on keeping the pantry stocked, which I think should pique the imagination of home cooks; and he is always an entertaining writer.  I highly recommend his memoir, \\"Toast.\\"	2005-07-12

They seem to be included to give the feel of the period, and aren't very interesting today.  That said, there are some worthwhile passages in this book, notably those that involve the author's bipolar mother. The problem is that the bulk of the memoir is larded with boomer-generation cliches: the motherly housekeeper, the exotic boarding school roommate, the high school 'fast crowd,' the exotic college roommate, the post-college communal household.  One cringe-worthy chapter in the middle is reminiscent of Neal Pollack's \\"I am friends with a middle-class black person\\"--minus the satire.  Finally, at the end, things just begin to get interesting as the author visits French vintners in the company of Kermit Lynch.  Perhaps the sequel is a better read.  For a far superior coming-of-age-with-food read, try Nigel Slater's \\"Toast.\\" It succeeds more effectively on every level--and all he had to work with was British food!	2005-01-28

However, it doesn't have enough going on to hold the attention of more experienced cooks.  Most dishes are flavored with ginger, garlic, soy sauce, and rice wine--and not much else.  Like many other British-published cookbooks I've had, it is stripped to the minimum.  Still, it's a good primer, with clear instructions and good pictures.	2003-07-04

It's a really engrossing, old fashioned page turner.  It's not a war book at all, more like a weird survival odyssey with a total wiseass: at one point he even poses as a sort of folk singer, probably not your usual POW escape plan.  Great stuff.	2003-05-28

Yes, it would be hilarious satire; in fact, the whole book would be, down to the self-important author's bio.  But alas, it's for real.  Characters in this book actually say such things as :\\"I'm a feminist, but I can still have fun!\\" and \\"When in doubt, whip it out.\\"  This book can only be the testament to the skill of Mr. Anderson's agent.

My problem with this book was that I couldn't just start with a trip to the grocery store.  For example, in order to make one dish, one must first have made 'poultry brown base sauce.'  In order to make this, one must first have made 'brown chicken stock,' which means one must have roasted several pounds of bones, then simmered them with vegetables and seasonings for a couple of hours...you get the idea.  The proper French method, of course, but I began to long for a dish that could be made with (gasp) canned broth or even a boullion cube.  I found this book inferior to the superb--don't let the grim title fool you--AMA family health cookbook. Assuming your supermarket has good produce, Asian, and Latin sections, any of it's recipes are easily achievable.  And delicious.	2002-01-26

The authors have somehow managed to avoid the pitfall of trying to make palatable meals out of skim milk and celery.  Instead, they have chosen dishes that at their best do not rely on unhealthy ingredients.  Butter, cheese, and the like do appear in some recipes, in moderate amounts, just enough to prevent feeling that there's something missing.  Among the best of the book:  Fennel and prosciutto risotto, Bulgur taboule, Butternut squash soup, Minted couscous salad, Fiery pork tenderloin, and a gingery won ton soup that will be in heavy rotation at our house for years to come.	2002-01-25

I first read it when I was fourteen, and find that I appreciate better now at 32 than I did then.  I am delighted to see it revived.  The boost it's gotten from J.K. Rowling, however, has proved a bit of a mixed blessing.  Many people seem to infer from her endorsement that it's of a genre with her writing.  In fact, this is not fantasy, but a beautiful evocation of the life of an observant teenager in 1930's England.  Highly recommended for artists, writers, and Anglophiles.  And may I suggest:  &quot;The Death of the Heart,&quot; by Elizabeth Bowen, for an alternate existence to Cassandra's.	2001-11-19

The protagonists are brought together by their gambling habits, a dangerous concentration of weakness.  With no voice of reason between them, they embark on a  tragic odyssey that kept me spellbound.  If I have a criticism, it's a slight one.

The author definitely gives the impression of a writer who sits down at his desk each day with no firm direction.  However, if you are a reader for whom the destination is less important than the journey, there is much here to interest you.  The protagonist seems to be searching for something to cure his malaise, and this quest takes him from Belgium to small town New England to Scotland, well-wrought descriptively.  Just don't expect a point to it all.	2001-08-04

It's built around a series of snowballing exercises that guide students from thinking about an issue that individually concerns them to becoming knowledgeable on that issue.  In the process they pick up the basics of research, writing, and revision.  It's progressive a la Dewey and Freire, with a heavy dose of logical reasoning, critical readings of sources, and media critique thrown in.<br />One caveat: its layout could use some work.  It's hard on the eyes at times.  But if you're a progressive fyc instructor, you'll like this.  If you're looking for a more standard textbook, it might be too provocative and/or political.	2001-06-24

(And in Washington DC... why, whichever library could that be?)  The mistake they - and, as Baker is arguing - and many other librarians are making is to see newspapers and microfilm as a simplistic either/or choice.  (Wrecking books to speed the process of microfilming them can rather force that choice...) Baker is hard on the faults of microfilm in this book, yes, but as a corrective to the uncritical acceptance that it has too long enjoyed.  Microfilm IS very useful, but it is not a complete substitute for the original.  BOTH should be used, or at least retained.<br />Look at most press coverage of this issue, and in Baker's book, and you'll find that the people defending microfilm, and paper culls, are librarians or those in the information industry.  NOT scholars or readers.  I defy you to find a scholar who has not found themselves thwarted at some point by crummy and unreadable microfilm for which there was no paper backup.  And as for acidification: I use old books and periodicals all the time, and sometimes they do crack or shed little chips of paper.  But most are still usable, and will remain so for many years - especially those which are rarely used, which is often the case with older material.  So why the rush to get rid of them?<br />Does Baker engage in some hyperbole in this book?  Yeah, probably.  Is he wrong to?  I'm not so sure.  The destruction he is describing, and the rate at which it is happening, requires a very loud wake-up call.  If you're buying this expecting a Baker novel, I guess you will disappointed.  But if you love books like his &quot;The Size of Thoughts,&quot; or if you are simply someone who truly cares about old books and writing - and yes, I include most librarians in that group - then you really need to read this.	2001-04-18

Quite so.  This book has the suicidal weariness of Brideshead Revisited, and a protagonist that you'd like to shake some sense into, a la Of Human Bondage.

This book's weakest point--a literary gimmick--kicks in early: a writer begins to hear a voice narrating her life, accompanied by, you guessed it, the clicking of typewriter keys.  However, as annoying as this trite little  device is, it has all but disappeared midway through the book, letting a  somewhat more complex concept take over.  The plot itself involves  smuggling and tangled relationships, with a wink at English Catholicism.
