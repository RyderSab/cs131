There are hundreds of books written about the early national period in our history. For the reader, the question becomes which are the books worth reading. For example, in the case of Miller's book, why should you read this one instead of Elkins and McKitrick's The Age of Federalism? The latter book is much the newer (1994 compared with Miller's original publication date of 1960), presumably benefits from all the great history that was written in between those two dates and won the Bancroft Prize. <br />I guess it all depends on what you are looking for. Miller's book was the standard history prior to the publication of Elkins and McKitrick's tome. If you have read about this era of our history you have come across many references to Miller's book. As history goes, it is a little more old fashioned in its interests. Miller's book focuses more closely on the main leaders and events of the period (i.e., it is a little bit more of the great man school of historical writing) and is probably a more standard narrative. <br />Miller has many felicities that make him still very much worth reading. I feel that I have read fairly deeply in this time period and have read many of the more specialized histories of the period. I didn't find anything in Miller that would need radical revision. What he covers, he covers very succinctly, in telling detail and with little of the partisanship that still attends writings about this period (why people feel we have to make a choice between Hamilton and Madison, for example, I will never know- they are both equally (ir)relevant to our politics). He covers the opening days of the new government, the emergence of Madison as a leader in Congress, of Hamilton as a leader in Washington's cabinet, the economic debates, the agrarian philosophical underpinnings of Jefferson's thought, the fateful struggle between Jefferson and Hamilton which was energized by events like the Whiskey Rebellion, the Alien and Sedition Acts, the Quasi-War with France, Jay's Treaty, the XYZ affair and all that other good stuff. <br />One of the ways that I evaluate the historians I read on early America is how much of a flavor they give me of the people of the time. For one thing, these were a people who knew how to fling a good insult: President Adams was once described as being \\"foremost in whatever is detestable\\" (p. 233 of Miller). Miller gives us plenty of this flavor and of the character of his protagonists. In fact, I have ordered a copy of the writings of Fisher Ames because of the quotes from this book cited by Miller. Miller's discussions of the qualities and accomplishments of Jefferson and Hamilton throughout the book are particularly exemplary. <br />Miller also points out some aspects of some of the noted controversies that I do not remember having read before. For example, in summing up his history of  the Alien and Sedition Acts and the resulting Kentucky and Virginia resolutions, Miller points out, \\"The Republicans did not question the principle that government must punish libels- they merely demanded that such prosecutions be undertaken by the states rather than by the Federal government...when they came into power, the Republicans transferred these trials from Federal to state courts, where the common law was enforced in all its rigor\\"(p.237). So much for state's rights being all about the protection of individual freedoms. <br />I personally feel that what occurred during the 1790's was a struggle for national dominance between two (largely) sectional elites which was complicated by the fact that one elite was the more economically sophisticated, the other was more politically adept, they were both appealing to a population that was rapidly evolving towards more democracy (for white men with a little property) and both had to deal with the wild card that was the politics of Pennsylvania. I think you will find plenty of support for this point of view in any history of the period. <br />Miller's book does havesome flaws. I hate the way he cites his sources. Miller writes a paragraph full of stuff that needs citing and then ends it with a single citation that does not clearly tell us what is the source of what. For example, Miller starts a chapter on Jefferson with the claim that during the Confederation period that Jefferson \\"wished to see the Federal judiciary made supreme over the state judiciaries in order that it might prevent the states from encroaching upon the authority of the Federal government\\" (p. 70). I would love to read that \\"wish\\" in context but I defy anyone to tell me where to look from Miller's citation. <br />But this is a geek's complaint (and I stand proudly as that American history geek). For the average reader Miller's book should be seen as just what it is: short, solid, insightful and still very much worth reading.  <br />So here is my answer to the question of Miller vs. Elkins and McKitrick: read both. If you are new to reading about the period, start with Miller. If your interest is piqued, then read some of the great specialty or popular histories of the period. Then cap it off with Elkins and McKitrick. Be sure to keep copies of the Library of America volumes of Washington, Hamilton, Jefferson and Madison near by. Whenever one of their writings is referred to, go read the original. (I am serious. This is the only way to separate what our ancestors actually wrote from the conservative claptrap hagiography that is written about them). And then write to me and explain to me how we progressed from those men thru Jackson and Polk and Lincoln and the Roosevelts to George I and George II. <br />	2005-10-02

John Taylor of Caroline is largely unknown these days yet in the 1780s thru the 1820s he was one of our most influential political theorists and commentators on the Constitution.<br /><br />His contributions to the pamphlet wars of the 1790s helped clarify the differences between the emerging Jeffersonian opposition and the positions of Hamilton, Adams and other Federalists. Later, starting with the publication of Arator and continuing through to his New Views on the Constitution, John Taylor developed a powerful variant of the so-called South Atlantic Republicanism. Taylor's philosophy (a powerful mix of state's rights, an emphasis on the rights of the {white} individual, Adam Smith's economic theories, veneration of farming and a fear of the \\"monied\\" interests) was influential for decades. It is difficult to read deeply in the history of the early republic without having to deal with Taylor's ideas and influence. In particular, I would think it very difficult to understand or appreciate antebellum Southern culture without an understanding of Taylor.<br /><br />But, I am going to assert, there is a darn good reason that his philosophy has been largely forgotten by all but the most fervid state's right advocate. Simply put, Taylor's particular form of republicanism is based on his ideas about the agrarian life and that is based on his views on slavery. More on that later.<br /><br />The book under review by Robert Shalhope is a form of intellectual biography. Shalhope is a great and influential historian (it is impossible to read contemporary academic history of the period and not see his name cited). Shalhope assumes that the reader is largely familiar with the great public events of Taylor's time and makes little effort to relate those events (if you need the background reading try Miller's The Federalist Era and Smelser's  The Democratic Republic for solid, short intros). Shalhope gives the broad outlines of Taylor's life- enough to see that on the personal level he was a sympathetic and very upright man (given his own morality). Mostly Shalhope is interested in exploring how the structure of Virginia life impacted Taylor's thought and vice versa.<br /><br />Along the way, he gives excellent summaries of all of Taylor's writings.<br /><br />Shalhope sees those writings as having a thematic arc that takes Taylor's thought from a form of \\"Revolutionary republicanism, once held in common with the larger national community, to a sectional ideology\\" (p.9).<br /><br />The earlier phase of Taylor's thought is explicated in his \\"An Enquiry into the Principles and Tendency of Certain Public Measures\\". Taylor claimed that the following six principles were fundamental:<br /><br />1. The Constitution established a republican form of government.<br /><br />2. Congress has the power to tax only for the public good-not for the<br /><br />good of private persons.<br /><br />3. The ultimate legitimacy of any legislation is derived from the people...<br /><br />4. which was regularly delegated by elections to representatives.<br /><br />5. A representative was legit only as long as he was impelled by the common good.<br /><br />6. Whenever any of the above was not true, the government had been usurped<br /><br />and was no longer legitimate. (p.76)<br /><br />The body of the pamphlet is spent explaining how these principles are imperiled by the Bank of the United States. Taylor seems to have been incapable, according to Shalhope, of seeing a bank as being anything but a fraudulent device to transfer money from those who actually earn it (the farmer, the mechanic) to those who don't (the \\"monied\\" interest, the stockjobber, the speculator, etc..).<br /><br />One could make the case that the rest of Taylor's writings were simply improvements on the themes of the 1790's pamphlets. But Shalhope sees a second phase of Taylor's ideas beginning to emerge with the publication of  the Arator essays in 1810. These newspaper essays presented not only Taylor's extensive knowledge of agriculture (he was a very successful and innovative farmer) but also his ideas on an ideal society (p.127).<br /><br />Taylor believed that there was a \\"common interest\\" that it was the duty of government to represent. This common or \\"natural\\" interest was based on the ownership of land. Land made fruitful by the work of the agricultural and laboring classes. This is true wealth and, by creating it, there was a natural fostering in those classes of necessary republican virtues. Natural labor led to lives of simplicity, honesty, frugality and temperance. It created men who were self-sufficient, beholden to no one yet who cared for their neighbors and their country. The representative of the country must be faithful to this interest and encourage it above all \\"artificial\\" interests if the young American nation was to survive as a bastion of freedom. Artificial interests were those of the stock-jobber, those of the paper money men and those who wanted a constant national debt. If the representatives were corrupted into the service of artificial interests, then we had become a nation of slaves. Thus the Arator essays were designed to bring about a renaissance of agriculture and thus of true republicanism (p.136).<br /><br />Many of the reforms that Taylor was to suggest in these and later writings were designed to maintain the health of this natural agrarian political economic foundation. His writings are full of intelligent warnings about not mistaking the ability to vote with freedom, about the political machinations of the wealthy capitalist (he actually used this word in some of his later writings {p.187}) and various constitutional changes that could help to foster the political position of the farmer.<br /><br />But there is always the presence of slavery. By the time of the Arator essays, Taylor owned 145 slaves (p.110). Since the essays are written for the Southern farming elite, they are full of suggestions on how to get the most out of your \\"animal labour\\", i.e., your slave. This gets to the crux of what I find so odd about Taylor and, for that matter, Jefferson and Madison and all the others. They wax poetic about the republican nature of<br /><br />farm labor but they weren't the ones doing the real labor. They merely oversaw. These weren't small family farms. Many of the founders (like Taylor) were solicitous of their slaves but only as long as displayed \\"complete submission\\" (p.142). They were terrified of being subjected to the schemes of the money men but they had no problem wielding a far more terrible power over their slaves. Yeah, they were conflicted but so what? A conflicted tyrant is still a tyrant. And ask yourself this- would our culture be so understanding of their conflicts if their slaves had been white?<br /><br />And so in the end, I am left with a great book about one of our great men who was terribly wrong about the centerpiece of his political theories. You can read Taylor for insights into Southern culture at the time or for insights into the early constitutional debates. You simply cannot read him for a usable political theory. His time is past to which I say (and I am an atheist), \\"Praise God\\".

Mr. Murphy's review below is a good example of this. For some reason, many people want to beatify certain individuals and trends in our early history and then judge histories of that period by how well they cleave to that reader's historical construction. The best example of this is the way that readers or historians react to Alexander Hamilton. <br />The problem with this tendency is that it distorts our reading of the history of that period. Here is a thought. I suggest that few people would be arrogant enough to claim that they had a standard by which the present could be judged. There are more things on heaven and earth than are dreamed of in your philosophies and so on. Well here is the Taylor axiom: \\"If it doesn't work for the present, it doesn't work for the past\\". <br />This is only to claim that we need to start seeing our past as not one reality but many different realities that were experienced by many different types of people. People who were liberal, radical, conservative, Whigs, rational and religious all at the same time. Otherwise, we cheapen them in the name of our pet ideas. <br />A case in point. Banning's book while strongly influenced by Pocock's work can be equally said to be as strongly influenced by Bailyn, Wood, Maier,Cunningham, Peterson, Foner and Ketcham. To claim that Banning is just channeling Pocock is to not see Banning through your ideological forest. <br />Furthermore to claim, that anyone who \\"really\\" knows his Jefferson will see through Banning's argument is a subtle ad hominem. I would appreciate actual quotes or some sort of evidence to back up such a claim. In any case, I am evidently not as knowledgeable as Mr.Murphy in that I am impressed by what Prof. Banning has to offer us. <br />Banning's thesis is that the Real Whig (or the \\"country\\" ideology) was initially useful to the Revolutionary situation because it helped them to conceptualize and justify their opposition to British policy as a unwilling protest against the corruption of the British regime. <br />But later these same arguments became useful to the rising opposition to the Hamiltonian economic program. The arguments proved even more useful in delineating different apporachs to foreigh affairs and central to the fight against the Alien and Sedition Acts. <br />Part of the reason the Country ideology fit the Jeffersonian's purposes so well is that their political situation was analogous to that of the Country party. Like Bolinbroke in his struggle with Walpole, John Taylor read the rising opposition not as the beginnings of a \\"party\\" (a dirty work for at least another 30 years) but as the reaction of \\"patriots\\" who were fighting against degeneracy and ministerial influence peddling (Banning, p. 200). Furthermore the Jeffersonians were initially a minority in Congress. \\"By nature, criticisim of corruption was a weapon of minorities, who...claim that influence had perverted the expression of the people's will in order to claim that they spoke for the majority\\" (Banning, p.74). <br />Overall, I find Banning's argument for the influence of the Country ideology on the Jeffersonians to be very persuasive. <br />Are his arguments flawless? Heck, no. On pp. 138-9, Banning makes an argument that Hamilton \\"may\\" have been influenced by a reading of Hume and certain \\"Court\\" replies to the Country arguments. By the next page, that \\"may have been\\" has become a definite influence. I like to call this particular fault \\"arguing from wishful evidence\\". But apart from a few faux pas like that, Banning comes across as learned and judicious. <br />This book is well worth the early American history reader's time to explore. And it should also be noted that Banning has published a companion volumn called Liberty and Order which contains many of the original writings that he refers to throughout his book. This brings me to one point in which I am probably in complete agreement with Mr. Murphy. As good as it is to read about these wacky guys and gals, it is even better to read their own writings. It's our history, people. We should own it. <br />	2005-09-10

John Larson has written one of the more important studies of the political economy of the antebellum republic. He has given me a new way to look at antebellum politics and an insight into the transition from the republican ideology of the founders to the triumph of laissez-faire capitalism in the post Civil War period.<br /><br />Before I explain his thesis, I want to express my admiration for aspects of his scholarly ethic. Larson has read deeply in original sources. He is as familiar with the daily debates in the U.S. Congress from around 1790 to 1860 as anybody I have ever read.<br /><br />He is equally at home in the writings of Washington, Jefferson, Adams, Madison, Gallantin, Jackson, Van Buren, John Taylor, Stephen Douglas, Henry Clay, Calhoun, ad infinitum. Readers of history owe a debt to writers who mine deeply into original sources. I thank Larson for that.<br /><br />I appreciate his apparatus of notes and bibliography. I learned about at least five books that I will read in the future. His footnotes are worth reading. He will often in a footnote refer to several different authors on an issue who disagree with each other. Another great service.<br /><br />All the more reason for me to be dismayed by one flaw in his writing that I will discuss later.<br /><br />Larson is telling the story of early attempts to build a transportation infrastructure in this country. We ended the Revolutionary War as thirteen separate countries. Most founders saw the need to unite the country by making economic interchange more open and easy.<br /><br />The problem was that we were largely a people that had for several hundred of years faced the Atlantic seaboard. Our economy was based on great port cities like Boston, New York and Baltimore. But with the push westward the need grew to create an efficient means to trade between the interior and the seaboard.<br /><br />The problem was that whatever technology was chosen to meet transportation needs (roads, river improvement,canals) all required large amounts of money. It really was more than any one person or even group of people could raise at the time. The ventures also tended to be risky. Canal engineering was nascent. Technical issues were solved (often poorly) as the canals were being built. It might be years before investors would see a return if ever.<br /><br />For these and other reasons, the supporters of these projects turned to the state and federal governments for the financial means to build the needed infrastructure.<br /><br />And there the fun began. The politics of the time was not conducive to the national government uniting behind the idea of supporting the building of improvements.<br /><br />Larson is very good at expounding all the byzantine (and sometime overlapping) schisms that fought over these issues. There were strict constructionists (usually from Virginia) who claimed that the federal government did not have the constitutional authority to build roads or canals. Nationalists like Henry Clay argued to the contrary. There were sectional schisms between east and west, north and south. There were concerns about the growing power of new states to make demands on the original thirteen, about the growth of the Slave power, about cabals of oligarchs lying in ambush to grow rich on taxes. There was competition between canals and railroads.<br /><br />Behind all of these theoretical and political differences were the economic interests of the areas that would be effected by the improvements and those that wouldn't.<br /><br />And in the middle of all this political folderol is the success of the Erie Canal. The Canal had many advantages over other projects. The elevation difference that the entire Canal had to confront was only 600+ feet. Thus technical problems were minimized. The Canal was brilliantly promoted in New York by DeWitt Clinton. The building was very well managed. They built it one section at a time and started running the completed section to supportthe building of the more difficult sections. This was very different from most projects that typically tried to build all sections at once to keep all the different constituencies effected by the canals happy.<br /><br />The success of the Erie Canal made New York City the business and capital center of North America. The irony of that is that the capital accumulation there would later make possible the building of railroads that would doom the Canal.<br /><br />All of this is told within the framework of what I see as Larson's main theme. He is appalled by the transition from the republican rhetoric of the founders to the liberal capitalist state that would give us Jay Gould. Larson feels that because of the intransigence of Southern oligarchs, of the facile and self-serving paternalism of the Jacksonians and all the other politicians who blocked every effort by the national government to build and control our infrastructure that we were driven into the unfeeling hands of the corporate capitalists. We never got a chance to see if government could build and run these improvements in the interests of the people.<br /><br />I have two comments. In spite of my heartfelt sympathy with his point of view, his own history documents that most every time the government was involved it became a means of enriching those involved. Sad but true. The greed of the capitalist was usually more efficient than the greed of the politicians.<br /><br />My last comment is in regard to Larson's writing. I felt many times that he simply didn't even try to present his story fairly. It is very easy 150 years later to see how hollow a philosophy is. The business of the historian is to try to present that philosophy to us in such a way as to help us see why it was taken seriously at the time. Larson's disdain for the constructionism of  John Taylor or for Jackson drips from his pen. This is his one failure as a historian. Don't avoid the book just because of that. There is too much to be learned here.	2005-08-25
US	50300521	R3QVINQ65NUGD0	0674004302	527393722	We, the Jury: The Jury System and the Ideal of Democracy	Books	5	8	9	N	Y	Dated but brilliant	There is a canard that to not know history it to be doomed to repeat it. Usually I have found that most people who read history do so in a manner that distorts it to fit their own views on contemporary issues (Newt Gingrich is a good example of this). This is not necessarily a bad thing but the reader should be self-aware.  There is some truth to the canard. It is impossible to read in early American history without realizing that many of the same issues that the founding generations dealt with are still being played out in the political arena.  I came to this book because I was looking for detailed background on the historical evolution of the jury, especially in regards to jury nullification. Over and over again in the ratification debates, various founders discuss the need for the jury to be able to decide on the law itself not just the facts of the case.  Abramson gives an excellent succinct discussion of the history, as well as the history of other aspects of the jury's role; e.g., the unanimous verdict, preemptory challenges and the application of the death penalty.  What makes these discussions particularly incisive (ironic?) is that Abramson contrasts our historical realities with an ideal of jury deliberation.   In his ideal type, the jury is a model of deliberative democracy. People bring to their jury duty the sum total of their knowledge and experience and work together to fashion a unanimous verdict based on a worked out sense of community justice. Abramson, I believe, regards this model as the ideal that juries have striven for over the centuries. One aspect of this ideal that he emphasizes is that it is only on a jury that most of us get to actually participate in the act of governance.  As a juror, I decide when and how to apply the law to my fellow citizens. At that moment, I am the government.  Abramson adds a new touch to this by insisting that jurors as members of the various groups that make up their identities (gender, class, religion, ethnicity, etc.) bring to the deliberation the different points of views that represents those groups. As long as we don't act as blind voting blocks for those groups but still listen, debate and decide together, we are still living up to the democratic ideal of the jury.  Abramson's discussion is incredibly rich. I will detail one further aspect of it in order (I hope) to whet your appetite.  In regards to jury nullification, Abramson makes an useful distinction. We may no longer have a legal right to nullify the law when on a jury (Sparf and Hansen v. United States, 1895) but we always have the power to do so. Jury nullification continues to occur (I would argue that the only way to understand the OJ Simpson verdict is as an instance of nullification). Abramson wants us to face up to this reality. We should instruct juries as to their power to nullify. His main argument for this is that nullification works only to an acquittal, not to convict (p. 92). In this I think he is a bit naive or relying on a bit of definitional legerdemain. Juries can and will decide to ignore a judge's instruction about the admissability of evidence and will on occassion convict someone on the basis of evidence they are not supposed to consider. This can only not be considered nullification by definition. But, like Abramsom, I am willing to take the leap on nullfication because I simply believe in the American people as a whole to try to get things right.  My main complaint against the book is of a different order entirely. This is a book that is badly in need of a second edition. Not one that has the new preface that the other reviewer mentions but a complete updating of the evidence, examples and discussion.  The first edition came out as the OJ trial was dominating our scandelmongering press and there is much that has changed in our legal system since then. I would love to reread this book in a up-to-date edition.  Until such time of grace, I cannot recommend this present edition highly enough. Abramson has taught me an enormous amount about our legal system. Whether arguing for unanimous verdicts or against preemptory challenges he is learned, thoughtful and fair to all sides. And, as always, I am made hopeful but the writing of someone who really believes in what we can be as a democratic people.  In fact, perhaps the praise I should be paying to the author is that he lives up to his own ideal of deliberative democracy. So should we all.	2005-07-23
US	50300521	R221H45IGWF76	0865972885	78796814	The Federalist	Books	5	12	20	N	Y	History, Veneration and The Federalist	We want our founders to be demi-gods and our original texts to be divinely inspired. For an example of this nonsense, please see the first review on this page.<br />I want to offer a vision of The Federalist in historical context. I will argue that to see it thus enlarges its greatness will allowing us to admit its faults.<br />In many ways, the developments that led to the Constitution of 1787 started as soon as colonists reached our eastern shores. We had at least 150 years of experimentation in writing charters and in representative governance behind us by 1787. After the Declaration of Independence the States either wrote new constitutions or reaffirmed old charters. The national government wrote the Articles of Confederation and we lived under that from 1781 to the late 1780s.<br />The Federalist should be seen as part of that ongoing development. More specifically, it should be seen as part of the ratification debates in New York. Largely written by Madison and Hamilton, these papers reflect the compromises that the founders made in regards to the Constitution. Madison had wanted the President to have a veto over any state laws. Hamilton had favored a President for life during good behavior (read #78 in re the appointment for life of federal judges to sense the fervor that Hamilton felt for the benefits of lifetime tenure). Neither man believed in the necessity of a Bill of Rights. Madison eventually saw the political necessity of such amendments. During the first United States Congress he wrote up the Bill of Rights and guided them through passage. This way he could make sure they did not grow too numerous.<br />As a whole then The Federalist should be seen as rhetorical and political arguments for passage of a Constitution that the authors had some doubts about.<br />Of course, as Publius they could express no doubts. Madison, Hamiltion and Jay used this pseudonym which was a typical rhetorical device of elite writers at the time. (See Saul Cornell's The Other Founders for a nice discussion of the variety of rhetorical strategies used by writers during the ratification debates.) The idea was that hiding their identities would allow readers to focus on the quality of their arguments. As a result, there are many passages that can strike the modern reader as duplicitous because Publius pretends to know nothing of what went on during the convention. Madison and Hamilton, of course, were instrumental throughout the Constitutional Convention.<br />Publius works his explication of the need for the Constitution by critiquing the Articles of Confederation then by going thru the new document, article by article supposedly answering all objections. His counterarguments are largely of two types. In the first type, he will state a political principle so \\"obvious\\" that any \\"candid\\" reader will instantly agree to it. Publius then builds his arguments from there. The famous paper #10 is one such chain of argument. Or Publius will demolish the arguments offered against the Constitution by pointing out that the article objected to is contained in some or many of the States' constitution and have resulted in no such problems. Many of these arguments are justly famous. Number 10 is very much worth reading. (Although I still find it curious that when Madison asserts that a man's property holdings has a great influence on the way he thinks it is celebrated as political realism but when Marx says much the same thing it is decried as class warfare. But that's just me.)<br />But the reader really does get a sense at to how much thought went into the various checks and balances and the competing claims of the states and the new national government. To me this is where the glory of the book lies. We as a people thought our way out of the failure of our first experiment in nation building. We avoided civil war (for a while) and did not become the victims of foreign manipulation. We don't have to make our founding fathers and mothers demi-gods. Intheir fully flawed humanity, they dazzle aplenty.<br />Finally, it should be noted that The Federalist as a piece of political rhetoric avoided some issues entirely. The main problem that most Anti-Federalists had with the proposed Constitution in re jury rights had to do with the following phrase: \\"such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed\\" (Article 3, Sec.2, Para. 3). Whig thought at that time insisted on juries being as local as possible. Blackstone stated that jury trials should be held within the county of the crime. This guaranteed that local knowledge of the crime, the defendant and the victim would be maximized in the jury pool. Trying cases in distant jurisdictions or without juries had been some of the main provocations of the British prior to the revolution. Men like Patrick Henry saw that phrase in the Constitution as a clarion of the tyranny to come from the new national government. The Federalist does not speak to this issue at all. Instead, Hamilton focuses on arguments about whether jury trials are guaranteed for civil cases and even has Publius argue that maybe we should limit jury trials a little because juries are so bad with complicated issues, blah, blah.<br />Should all Americans read this book? Yeah, probably. Are we the worse if they don't? Again, probably yes, but what we really need as a people is more of a sense of our history. I would rather have more people read a good series of books on our history as a whole (I recommend the Oxford History of the United States as one excellent ongoing series).<br />But if you want to get to know two great minds at work on political issues that are still relevant then this is your book.

The debates surrounding the adoption of the Constitution continue to be thoroughly exhumed for insights into what our Founders were thinking. The writings of the Anti-Federalists both in the press of the time and in the state conventions that approved the Constitution have been reconsidered. I recently reviewed a history by Saul Cornell that considers those writings to be the beginnings of a dissenting tradition that continues to this day. <br />One of the things that strikes any reader of recent histories of the ratification debates is what a gold mine it is for philosophy of history. There are few historical moments that can offer greater insight into the difficulties of determining what were the intentions or motives behind the speech and actions of historical actors. Depending on what reading background, theory of human nature and political persuasion a historian brings to their readings of these debates it is possible to see Madison, Hamilton and the other players as having any number of motives. <br />Max Edling has obviously lived and breathed the volumes of the ongoing publications of The Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution. More importantly he has studied deeply the history of nation formation in Europe. The lesson of that branch of European history has been that the modern European state was formed by the exigencies of war. Baldly put, European states started to force each other into maintaining large armies (or navies) even during peacetime. This development fed and was fed by a revolution in state financing. The majority of the monies to maintain their armies and fight their wars came from loans. In England, this became a large funded public debt which was religiously serviced by taxes and securities. <br />This is the background against which Edling wants us to see the ratification debate. The Federalists ignored their instructionsto amend the Articles of Confederation and wrote up a whole new document, our present Constitution. The most controversial portions of that document related to the maintenance of a peacetime army and the unlimited ability to raise taxes. Our Anti-Federalists, who Edling sees as the American progeny of the English \\"Country\\" dissent traditions saw this as the road to tyranny. Standing armies in peacetime had been murderously used to squelch dissent in England (the killing of 7 at St. George's Fields in 1768) and in America (the Boston Massacre in 1770). <br />The Federalists, on the other hand, argued that we had no choice. England remained to our north and Spain was to the south and at the mouth of the Mississippi. The English had refused to turn over forts in the west as agreed in the peace accords. Unless those troops were removed and the forts handed over there was no way to assert control over the formidable Indian tribes of the Old Northwest. <br />Even worse, the federal government under that Articles of Confederation was insolvent by 1787. The various states ignored the requisitions of the Congress, the certificates that we had used to pay off the Continental Army at the end of the Revolution were worthless, we had defaulted on loans from France and Spain and had actually had to borrow more money from Dutch lenders in order to pay them the servicing on debts we already owed them.  <br />The Federalists believed that the key to rescuing our credit and our ability to defend ourselves (remember that modern wars are always fought on credit) was for the Federal government to be able to establish and collect taxes directly from the people. A government without a source of revenue is a beggar. Here's another thought for you; Who would fight for us the next time? Knowing that we had failed to pay troops some of whom had fought seven years in our Revolution? <br />Again, the Anti-Federalists had concerns over the power of the national government to tax. It was their belief that the state legislatures were far more representative of the people's wishes than the national government could ever be. The new national government would would feel any number of  temptations to lay more taxes on the people. Recent English history showed that this was quite probable. <br />One aside- it is very clear from Edling's argument that in the thought of many of the founders on both sides of the ratification debate that the final stage of legitimizing any law was the willingness of the people to obey it. In other words, if there was wide spread resistance to any measure passed that it was the legitimacy of the measure that was questioned. The people's representatives were seen to have failed in their function. Can you imagine our George II operating under such conditions? Just imagine how the Anti-Federalists would have reacted to the Patriot Act!  <br />My only problem with Edling's argument is that it is too monocausal. I think that Edling has made an enormous contribution to our understanding of the debates of the founding. But if I had to use only one prism to view those debates, it would be the concept of localism versus distant government. I tend to read the Federalists as wanting a strong national government that was also somewhat distant from the people. It had to be able to raise taxes, borrow money and wage war. Otherwise it would inevitably dissolve. They also wanted a legal system that was a little further out of the control of local juries and judges. They wanted the ability to set national economic policy. They wanted to create a political culture that would continue to allow the \\"natural\\" elite to rule and put some breaks on mobocracy, etc.. I believe that they realized that the only way to legitimately do that was to create a stronger more effective national government. <br />In any case, Edling's book is now necessary reading for a fuller understanding of the political context in which our founders lived. Start reading, people. <br/>	2005-05-23
US	50300521	RX0XYJHJ0X5CX	0195140567	751473956	The Virtues of Liberalism	Books	5	7	9	N	N	The location of our responsibility	As the reviewer below mentions, this is a collection of articles that Kloppenberg has published at different times over the years. I agree with the reviewer below that there is some overlap between the articles. In fact, the whole argument would have been greatly strengthened by just rewriting the articles as a new book. Kvetch, kvetch, kvetch. <br />Yes, it could be better but what we have here is one of the strongest combinations of historiography and actual history possible. There are so many virtues to this book that to complain that it could be better would be downright inane of me. <br />Kloppenberg is exploring several themes in the course of these articles. The first is that the past is messier than it is usually presented as being. There is a tendency in much historical writing to want to simplify that messiness in order to argue a particular point. Thus the whole republicanism-liberalism debate. Kloppenberg wants us to accept that our founders drew from multiple traditions including Protestantism, republicanism, an early liberalism restraint by natural law and the Scottish Enlightenment. They themselves saw these traditions as largely compatible. They were not interested in intellectual consistency as much as working through the issues of the times within the institutions they were trying to create. They tried to balance competing values and interests. Gosh, just like we do. <br />His second major theme is the centrality of religion to all American thought but especially to our political thought. \\"The language of religion...was pivotal in enlisting the allegiance of eighteenth-century Americans to the republican cause. Thomas Paine was an American hero when he sprinkled Common Sense with biblical allusions...he became a pariah when he attacked Christianity in The Age of Reason\\" (p.62). Christianity later sustained the abolitionists, the woman's movement, the Knights of Labor and the progressives.  Kloppenberg wants to claim that perhaps the major reason liberalism seems to no longer speak the majority of Americans is that it has become aggressively secular. <br />Finally, Kloppenberg wants to assert the centrality of pragmatism to both historiography and political and cultural practice. In fact, pragmatism becomes the method by which we balance competing claims of all kinds. The pragmatic method is presented as being an ongoing balancing act between competing values, between knowledge and faith, between the rights of the individual and the responsibility of the individual to their community. <br />I want to emphasize a couple of points that Kloppenberg makes here. He quotes the following from Walter Lippman's Drift and Mastery:  <br /> \\"Everyone is compelled to omit infinitely more than he can deal with; everyone is compelled to meet the fact that a democratic vision must be made by the progressive collaboration of many people\\" (p. 130). This is a difficult but important point and gets to one of the paradoxes of Kloppenberg's approach. The idea is that politics is never-ending and is constantly being revised. Everything is open to question by the democratic community. This is where my review title comes from. The location of our responsibility is in submitting honestly to this type of political practice as constant critique (p.89). <br />Not only is our knowledge provisional but it must also be seen as contextual, i.e., as the product of a particular time and place. All of our cultural values are as well. Our rights such as free speech or \\"the duty of mutual respect\\" are the result of centuries of hard and sometimes bloody \\"cultural labor\\"(p.159). I mention that particular duty because I am often dismayed by the tone of reviews of political books on Amazon. Mutual respect may be a value we are losing and we are the smaller for it. <br />I greatly admire Kloppenberg's learning and approach to these issues. I think he is absolutely on the right track. My major issue with his approach has to do with the dialogue betweenfundamentalists (of all kinds- scientism, religious, political) and those (like myself) who see tolerance as being a sine qua non for democracy. I recognize that tolerance for a fundamentalist is a very questionable value. If you really believe you know the truth why would you tolerate falsity? This seems to me to be the major challenge facing any form of deliberative democracy- how do you get everyone to agree to play by the rules? <br />I would like to make one last compliment to Kloppenberg. This is an incredibly learned man. He seems to have absorbed so much of not just our cultural tradition but that of France, England and Germany's that it is a little bit scary. If you are curious to see more of his methodology at work or some of that learning on display take a look at his Uncertain Victory: Social Democracy and Progressivism in European and American Thought. It is one of the great works in intellectual history in the last twenty years. <br />	2005-04-18

This book is a well-focused incursion into several ongoing debates in early American historiography. Anyone who has read academic history about that period in the last thirty years should be aware of the republicanism-liberalism debates as well as the arguments surrounding the development of capitalism in the early republic.  <br />Shankman's book focuses on Pennsylvania politics during the years of the Jefferson and Madison administrations as well as the decades immediately prior and after. Pennsylvania had the most advanced and diversified economy of any of the states. For that reason, Shankman believes that the arguments among the various factions of the Jeffersonian party ended up being of great consequence. Much of the rest of the country followed Pennsylvania's lead and the broad consensus that came out of Pennsylvania in regards to the meaning of democracy and the state's role in economic development became the national consensus for the first half of the nineteenth century. <br />Shankman's first chapter is a superb exposition of the development of the opposition to Hamilton's economic policies and to Adam's assertion of national power in reaction to the Whiskey Rebellion and in the passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts. His exposition is concise and very even handed. On the state level, three strands of Jeffersonians emerged: the Quids, the Snyderites and the Philadelphia Democrats. Shankman delineates their differences and traces those to differences in their geographical origins and social status. <br />As long as they were a party of opposition these three variants were able to work together. With the election of Jefferson in 1800 their differences fractured their alliance. <br />This is the meaning of Shankman's title. The \\"crucible of conflict\\" is practically a mantra throughout this book. The idea is that the political debates and electoral conflicts in Pennsylvania drove the Jeffersonian's thought in directions it would not otherwise have gone. In the end, they had to either give up some of their cherished ideals or be brushed aside in state politics as irrelevant. <br />For example, one of the basic assumptions of the thought of the time was the idea of \\"the people\\". There was this sense that there was a common interest that united the whole populace. If no one started out from a position of too much relative wealth or political influence and if all were allowed to freely pursue their dreams then no major conflicts could develop among the people. If there was discord, it was due to distortions in the system, e.g., the judges manipulating the judicial system in defiance of the majority (the more things change...) The problem that the Jeffersonians had to face was \\"the creative endeavors of certain citizens were causing inequality to grow among citizens\\" (p.168). <br />The eventual solution to the issue of equality and economic development was to allow everyone an \\"untrammeled right to pursue his self-interest\\" (p.165). <br />This development is played out in Shankman's telling of the 1805 governor's race. This chapter is another incisive exposition. Shankman is an excellent writer. <br />One final but very important point. In his final chapter, Shankman positions his thesis in the ongoing debates that I mentioned at the beginning. He expounds on Merrill and Wilentz' point that it is easy to look back at this period and to see the development of a capitalist economy as being inevitable. They point out that while everyone back then embraced \\"commerce and commodity production\\" that that is not the same thing as capitalism (p.240). This is a common problem in historical writings. A wide open development is seen as having been almost inevitable. One of the real strengths of Shankman's book is that he reminds us just how wild and wooly in possibility this period was. Capitalism was not inevitable. We could have gone a different way. This is a superb telling of why we went the way we did. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-04-06

The Other Founders by Saul Cornell represents a needed correction to our historical understanding of American history from 1787 to 1830.   The tendency of scholars since the early works of Pocock, Robbins, Bailyn, Woods and McDonald has been to write about that period in terms divorced from a vocabulary of economic interests or class.   The other great simplification has been to see the period in bifurcated categories. Federalist vs. Anti-Federalists is the dichotomy that Cornell takes on. Does anyone think that the current American political scene can be adequately summarized as Democrats vs. Republicans? Is our current political and intellectual scene that much more complicated or nuanced or diverse than that of the founders? Only the Arrogance of the Present could make that claim.   What Cornell does is show that Anti-Federalism (A-F, for short) was a uniting of diverse interests and ideas for the purpose of opposing the Constitution. There were three major variations of A-F that Cornell delineates. There was the elitist version associated with thinkers like Richard Henry Lee and Elbridge Gerry. There was a \\"middling\\" A-F associated with New York and Pennsylvania thinkers like Melancton Smith. There was a plebian A-F associated w/ writers like William Manning and William Petrikin. By the way, getting to know these two characters is worth the reading of this book. Cornell is excellent in this early part of the book at explicating how these different types of A-F thought differently about issues like federalism, localism, the powers of juries vs. judges, representation and the role of political clubs and popular political rituals.   After A-F failed to stop ratification, they were united by their demands for a Bill of Rights. After the success of that endeavor, A-F was united by its opposition to the consolidationist tendencies of Hamilton and Adams. After the 1800 election brought to power administrations that shared their general concerns, the fault lines within A-F begin to split the movement. In the end, A-F split up into various strategies of constitutional interpretation that opposed what the Marshall court was doing.   All of this history is contained within 300 well-written pages.   There are a couple of methodological points that I want to make and then a few general comments.   The first methodological comment is that Cornell argues for a reevaluation of which were the most influential A-F writers on the basis of which were the ones whose essays were reprinted the most. This seems fair although it shunts to one side some of the more powerful A-F writers like Brutus.  The second methodological point is that Cornell uses Habermas' notion of the public sphere to great effect in this book. My problem with this is that occasionally he interjects that phrase into a quote by an A-F writer or, in one case, by Madison. I found myself wanting to go to library to read the original quote to see whether this usage might distort the meaning of the Madison quote. To introject a modern theoretical concept into a source quote is always (IMHO) questionable even if its use is arguably justified. There are bound to be distortions. But this is a somewhat minor point.  The first general comment is this. What is unique about ALL of the political theorists who wrote at this time in our history is that they were ALL either working politicians or public intellectuals. They were writing in response to the issues of the day, to the economic needs of their neighbors and to the shifting tides of power. Intellectual consistency is prized by theorists, by those isolated from life or who wish to impose on life a tyranny of ideas (if you cannot think of a current example for what I am saying than, for doG's sake, go read a newspaper). The Madison of Publius was not the same Madison who wrote the Virginia Resolution or the Report of 1800. Neither was the same Madison who served as our fourth President or the Madison in retirement from public life. This was a huge intellect responding to a vastly changing world. He realized that he had miscalculated and had to rethink basic issues. There is no one Madison that we can lay claim to. This is one of the strengths of Cornell's presentation.  Which brings me to my second point. I have a question to all those who advocate an \\"originalist\\" interpretation of the constitution. Whose \\"original\\" interpretation? Why theirs over the others that were being discussed at the time? Indeed, why theirs over ours considering how much the world has changed in the interlude? And would many of us really want to live under a national government as imagined by any of the founders?   I challenge y'all to read this book and then email me your answer. Let the debates begin!	2005-03-17
US	50300521	R23E13YNXJ2LI8	0226895637	473791613	Self-Rule: A Cultural History of American Democracy	Books	5	18	18	N	N	A history of our democracy	Robert Wiebe has written a brilliant history of the American meaning of democracy.  <br />Over the years, Wiebe had (he passed away a few years ago) read deeply in democratic theory whether written by philosophers, social scientists or what he calls publicists (what I would call popular commentators- people like Kevin Phillips, Robert Bellah, William Greider, Irving Kristol).  <br />He concluded that most of their writings about democracy had been skewed by a lack of any historical foundation. Their theories had no cultural specificity and no sense of what had worked as opposed to ideas about how democracy \\"should\\" work.  <br />This book is the result. He chose about 60 core writings (one by each author with the singular exception of Rawls who is allowed two). The introduction is a very enjoyable summing up of the some of the problems that Wiebe has with these core writings. It comes down to the fact that, whether from the left, right or middle, all of the authors feel that We the People have failed to live up to our responsibility to see it their way. (Please note that Wiebe is much more elegant about how he argues for his point). <br />Wiebe then launches into his historical corrective. He has three major themes about the history of democracy in this country.  <br />The first theme is based on his assertion that, \\"societies organize around the rules of who works for whom, and the beneficiaries protect those rules in the name of all that is good in this world and holy in the next\\" (p.23). Wiebe asserts that there have been two major changes in those rules in our history and that those changes have created three major stages in our democratic history.  <br />The second theme is that our democracy has two major components: the collective and individual or, in another phrasing, popular self-government and individual self-determination (p.9). These components have sometimes worked with each other and sometimes against each other.  <br />The final theme is how the various institutions of democracy (e.g. voting qualifications) have been used to tame or obstruct some of the \\"excesses of democracy\\"  <br />Wiebe (I am stating this very baldly) sees the major changes as occurring sometime around the 1820s and the 1930s. In the first case, we moved from a system that was still based on deference to elites in all aspects of our lives. As a people we looked to leaders in our churches, in our local communities and on the national level to represent us, to act in our common interest. Many Americans arrived on these shores legally obligated to their employers. We were a nation of apprentices, indentured servents and tenants. Wiebe's democratic changes began with challenges to that form of work structure. Indentured servitude was challenged in the courts and lost. Apprenticeships began to disappear. After the War of 1812, the Native American no longer had any European power that helped them resist American incursion on their lands. We stole as much land from them as we could including large chunks of Alabama, Georgia and Florida. The U.S. government then sold that land cheaply and in small parcels. As a result, by the 1850s, almost 90% of American farmers owned their own land.  <br />Such self-directed work was reflected in the political realm. The mandate broadened to include all white men. And those white men played the democratic citizen with a fervor throughout the 19th century that has not been matched since.  <br />In some ways, this is the period of American history that Wiebe sees as having been the most democratic. The political power of the time was diffused so there was little chance for effective corruption. White men exerted control locally and nationally. When the discussion broke down, we went to war, i.e., the Civil War. But afterwards, after the brief interlude of Reconstruction, we went back to white men deciding within their own communities how to do things. Please do not read me or Wiebe as saying this was a good thing- itis simply the way it was. The 1930s put an end to all that democracy by establishing a national elite working together with local middle class elites. The national elite was not so much one of money as of values. Wiebe sees this compromise between national and local elites as born of the necessity of the 1930s. The national government determined the shape of policy and the local elites were allowed how to put it in place. Choices were presented as not being about competing values but about the rationality of policies. Such things should be left to the experts, the technocrat.  <br />This particular compromise worked until the 1960s. Previously marginalized groups (African-Americans, women, Native Americans, etc.) began to assert their rights on the streets, through the courts or through Congress. When the national elite institutions like the Warren Court began to challenge the local elites over their control over their own communities then the war of values began again.  <br />This is where Wiebe leaves us. I cannot overstate how more insightful his presentation of the argument is then my summation. I have rarely marked up a book as much as I have marked up this one. His arguments and insights cut across the political spectrum and are fueled by a faith in our ability to decide our own fate as a collective and as individuals. He does not feel that we have to be more educated, more rational, less religious or more serious. Wiebe wants us to simply show up, act and demand control over our lives. His solutions can be summed up in the idea of diffusing decision making. I have serious doubts about how easy he makes some of this sound (I wonder sometimes if it is possible to universalize the rights enumerated in or \\"emanating\\" from the Constitution. Yet I know we have to keep trying). But I cannot express how refreshing is Wiebe's attitude and faith in us. This book deserves the widest possible audience and discussion. <br />	2005-02-25

I wish I had known of this book when I first started to read seriously in American history. Simply stated this is a great place to start in the study of the 1770-1800 period. It is a little outdated but it is dealing with a lot of historical work that remains essential. The following is a partial list of the authors whose work Shalhope has tried to contextualize within his interpretive framework: Joyce Appleby, Bernard Bailyn, Joseph Ellis, David Fischer,  Jack P. Greene, Nathan O. Hatch, Rhys Isaac, Isaac Kramnick, Kenneth Lockridge,  Drew McCoy, Jackson Turner Main, Gary Nash, Caroline Robbins and Gordon Wood. <br />In six very well written and compressed chapters ( the whole book is less than 170 pages!), Shalhope outlines the main ideological framework of the \\"old order\\", the emergence of \\"revolutionary republicanism\\" as effected not just by political thought but by current religious movements, developments in the arts and changes in the economic realm and finally the transition to the liberal democratic thought that Shalhope feels was characteristic of the early nineteenth century. <br />Shalhope makes several points that are worth discussing. For someone like myself (an agnostic who leans toward atheism in my dogmatic moments) one of the more challenging aspects of American history is how often the impetus toward reform and/or revolt was deeply religious. The rise of Baptism in the 1760s and 1770s would prove to be profoundly democratic. \\"Baptists sought an orderly, moral community, a more secure center of social control centered in the people themselves rather than in a gentry-controlled social hierarchy.\\" (p.36) The locus of authority shifted from the gentry to the saved individual within their fraternal community. This is one of the many ways in which the \\"old order\\" broke down and which would have implications for post-Revolutionary politics. <br />Shalhope also writes very well about the shifting meanings of virtue during this period. This period saw Locke's thought shifted from natural equality to a \\"natural right to equal opportunity\\" by reformers like Richard Price (p.48). Virtue began to shift in meaning from an emphasis on civic virtues like the selfless love of country (exemplified by Washington) to economic virtues like frugality and personal economic autonomy. <br />Shalhope explores these shifting meanings in his last chapter which focuses on the conflict in the 1790's between the Federalists and the Republicans. <br />I would love to have a chance to actually converse with the author on several points. I have notice in many writings on this period a determination not to see the schisms of the time in anything approaching a class framework. The emphasis is always on political thought or ideology but not the emerging economic classes whose attempts to justify the breaking of restraints on their activity inspire so much of that thought. <br />Shalhope (I feel) circumnavigates this issue by placing the conflicts within a hierarchy/localism context (derived from the work of Kenneth Lockridge).  The Federalists are the party of Heirarchy- they stood for more centralized economic and political control. The Republican becomes the party of Localism- they stood for diffused localized control that was more democratic in its nature. I find that a useful way to look at things but I also think that there was an emerging sense among the working and \\"middling\\" peoples of this country that their needs were not represented by either the Republican or Federalist elites. I just have a hard time seeing either Jefferson or Madison (as great as they were) as being the champions of the \\"mechanics\\". <br />I would love to debate the issue with Shalhope. Thelearning that resulted would be one-side but, heck, I could use some good learning. But I digress. <br />To sum up, in spite of being somewhat out of date, this is an enormously useful book for anyone reading about the political history of this period.

One of the pleasures that I take as a leftist (not a liberal, mind you, but a leftist) in reviewing American history books is in the debunking of the hagiography that passes for the biographies of our great men. <br />But for anyone who claims to want to look at history with a hard realist eye there is one uncomfortable fact that (like a well-aimed rock tossed by Clio herself) smacks you upside the head now and then. <br />The truth is that there are great men and women. And that it is simply not possible to make these individuals seem small without fudging the facts. <br />Flexner, in this his second volume of a four volume standard of American biography, makes the strongest possible case for the greatness of George Washington. <br />Washington was a farmer, a man who delighted in his domestic life. He was also an exemplar of the classical mindset that was common among the founding generation. For these men and women, fame was to be sought as the founder of a just constitution or as the general who served his country to save it from foreign or domestic enemies not as a career or a means to power. <br />In some ways, Flexner's Washington reminds me of his near contemporary, Tecumseh. Both men seemed to have sought power as a modality of service. Hard to even imagine in this the Era of the Millionaire Serving His Own. Among other virtues, this book serves to remind us that there are many types of patriotism and that some of them can be the foundational virtue for truly admirable lives. <br />The structure of this book is quite brilliant. All but the last chapter is a straightforward narrative of the eight years that Washington spent as the Commander-In-Chief of the Continental Army. The last chapter, \\"Cincinnatus Assayed\\", serves as a summing up of Washington's quality as a general and an explanation of how that service prepared him for his Presidency to come. All of his points have been made by the preceding narrative and seem inconvertible. <br />Two examples: Washington struggled throughout the war with the unstable financing of his army by the various States. Part of the problem was the fact that the continental currencies became increasingly worthless. Under the tutelage of his friend, Robert Morris, Washington gained an understanding of the need for a strong national economy and monetary system. This understanding would then influence his reaction to the Hamilton-Jefferson debates that were to largely mark Washington's Presidency. <br />Another point that is worth pondering is how Washington's innate merciful nature served the development of a growing sense of nationalism in the various States. Whenever possible, Washington did not punish Tories, enemy soldiers, his own soldiers who violated his orders or civilians who lived in the areas where the war was being fought. <br />He seemed to understand that if you want to win the hearts and minds of a people that it is necessary to treat them as much as possible as if they were your neighbors. Time and time again in Flexner's narrative it is apparent how much this policy of restraint added to Washington's prestige and effectiveness. Our current George should pay more attention.  <br />Finally, I would also like to recommend Charles Royster's great A Revolutionary People At War as a companion volume. Royster very effectively tells the history of the Army from the point of view of its soldiers. These two books together make it obvious just how lucky we were in the great founding generation. I can say this as a leftist and an American (not a contradiction and never has been): these were great men and women. We would do well to study their example. <br />	2004-11-25

We tend to forget that up until the late nineteenth century most economists saw their field as a branch of politics and/or ethics. <br />The purview of this altogether brilliant book is the Federalist period thru the Monroe administration. McCoy elucidates the main theories of political economy in the early Republic and examines how practical politics forced the likes of Jefferson, Madison, Hamilton and many others to change or adapt their views. <br />What these men were concerned with was the longevity of our country. A republic required a virtuous citizenry. In order to maintain such a citizenry, the republic must be run in such a way as to produce such paragons. <br />It is important to keep in mind that this was a period of time that tended to see republics as doomed in the long run. Accelerating that decline was the development of the manufacture on non-essentials or luxuries that were typified by the advanced economies of Europe. The manufacturing of these luxuries seemed to inevitably lead to the sort of personal and governmental corruption that every good American saw in Great Britain. <br />What came to be seen as the Jeffersonian solution to this issue was the idea of the yeoman republic- that we would be largely a nation of independent farmers. Such men were beholden to no one so they would naturally be more inclined to look to the public interest. They would eschew luxuries and live a reasonably simple life. They would be busy enough to be free of the debilitating effects of indolence (it is evident from McCoy's pages that the fear of the Great Unwashed wandering without occupation thru the streets drove many a founding father to researching and writing about political economy). Yet our yeoman farmers would have enough time to read and study the great issues of the day. Since we had an enormous frontier for future population growth to claim and cultivate it would be decades before we would have to deal with the economic consequences of population growth. <br />It is easy to mock such a viewpoint (and I admit to a wee mockery above). But it would be impossible to mock the scholarship that is used to develop the history of this viewpoint. <br />The first two chapters of the book set up the rest of the history. In these chapters, McCoy examines assumptions about luxury, indolence, mercantilism, and foreign trade in the writings of Mandeville, Ferguson, Adam Smith, Hume and Franklin among others. The chapters are gems of compression of exposition. <br />To me, however, the book gets more interesting in the later chapters as the above Jeffersonian synthesis emerges and the successive administrations of Jefferson and Madison attempt to use it to guide us in our foreign and economic policies. Here we are dealing with the thoughts of Albert Gallatin and Alexander Hamilton as well as numerous lesser writers. And here our ideological assumptions are battered by the stubbornly self-serving policies of Britain, France and Spain. <br />The main result was that to one degree or another both Madison and Jefferson were forced to eventually come to terms with the necessity of developing our own manufacturers and developing an internal market for their goods. <br />This is a thoroughly enjoyable extremely well written book which elucidates one of the earlier examples of an ongoing American tendency to confuse our ideological assumptions with the bones of reality (as it were). It is an important lesson to keep in mind that the assumptions about human nature that any one economic theory make are usually among  the most nave and the most political aspects of that economic theory. So I guess the title of my review should be: Does anybody else realize that we are still doing political economics? <br />	2004-09-12

The author, Graham Lock, accompanied the quartet on their tour. The book includes transcriptions of ten or so interviews Lock did with Braxton as well as with the other members of the group. These are connected with concert reviews, stories of the tour and essays on Braxton's ideas on musical languages, systems of notations, etc. This is not a scholarly book. It is an enjoyable read that serves as an excellent introduction to the work and thought of one of the few musical geniuses that resides on the planet.<BR>Braxton holds forth on every aspect of his music (from his innovative solo work to his compositions for four orchestras or the notated composition for one hundred tubas!) as well as on his ethical, political and spiritual beliefs. Some of this stuff will seem pretty out there to most readers but what emerges is a portrait of the artist as a very thoughtful, passionate, and thoroughly engaging man. Braxton and his cohorts are very much worth knowing.<BR>One side note- for those of you who are Braxton freaks (as am I) it is worth noting that three of the concerts from this tour have been released on the Leo record label. All three are available from Amazon for your multi-media listening pleasure. They are Birmingham(1985), Coventry (1985) and Quartet (1985). The latter should really be listed as London (1985). I recommend any of the three, especially the Coventry concert. This truly was one of the premier quartets of the eighties.	2003-08-26

My purpose in writing this review is a little different than usual. Normally I want to give some summary of what the author has written and offer a wee bit of criticism. With William Reddy's The Navigation of Feeling, I plan to take a different tack. I want to try to summarize this book cogently enough so that others want to read it and write their own reviews. This is a book that should be thoroughly discussed on the pages of [Amazon.com] and by more competent reviewers than myself.<br />Reddy's complex argument is presented in two parts. The first half of the book is a summation of research drawn from cognitive psychology, cultural anthropology, and contemporary philosophy in such a way as to present a new theory of emotions. Reddy's theory is designed to work our way out of the impasse presented by the Cartesian dualism common to cognitive psychology and the postmodernism common to cultural anthropology.<br />In the section on cognitive psychology, Reddy is trying to establish several points. The first is that the separation of emotions from reasoning simply doesn't hold up in the research. The second point is that emotions are not just simply experienced. They can be monitored, controlled and possibly changed by individuals. Our ability to do this is in itself regulated and somewhat determined by the culture we live in.<br />These results are supported by what Reddy derives from recent work on emotions in the field of cultural anthropology. Here the predominant theoretical approach is social constructivist. Reddy again wants to emphasize several points. One is that the research indicates that there is tremendous difference in emotional expression from culture to culture although they all seem to draw from the same large pool of possible human emotional expression. The second point, which was original to this reader, is the point that \\"the ethnographic data routinely contain traces of collective shaping of emotional effort and collective elaboration of emotionalideals\\"(p.56). When an individual succeeds in living up to these ideals, they are encouraged and admired. Indeed, such successful emotional control may become a source of power for that individual.<br />So far, what Reddy is presenting is a picture of the emotions as being culturally constructed and circumscribed but also as an area of individual endeavor. In effect cultures create \\"emotional regimes\\" that monitor and encourage certain types of emotional expression. Individuals can master their emotions to fit into these regimes through their own efforts and can even over time act in such ways as to change the regimes. How Reddy feels that can occur he explains in the philosophical section of Part 1.<br />Reddy wants to avoid a postmodernist approach that is based on the signifier/signified relationship. He feels that this leads us to a dead end where all cultures are equally \\"valid\\".<br />Reddy wants to move from Saussure to Quine. Instead of arbitrary signifiers, Reddy wants to use the concept of \\"translation\\". Reddy sees the main advantage of this move as being that translation allows us to deal with two qualities of utterances that the signifier idea does not. \\"...the poststructuralist concept of the sign, because it entails operating with only one code at a time, is by far inferior to ...translation...An utterance occurs not just in the context of a single background code, but also in the presence of material available in many other codes: not just sensory codes...but also procedural codes (p. 321)<br />Another benefit of the concept of translation is that it restores to the individual that agency, that ability to critique one code because of its lack of fit with the other codes that make up the individual's experience.<br />Where Reddy feels that this leaves us is with the idea that 1. we can outline a history of the emotional regimes of a culture. This allows us to move beyond the static explanations of emotions offered by anthropology and psychology. It alsoallows us to deepen our historical understanding by broadening the context of history. It allows us to see one more facet of what was expected of and done by the people that populate our histories.<br />The second major result of all this is that Reddy feels that his theory allow us to critique and evaluate emotional regimes for how much freedom they allow the members of that culture.<br />I mentioned above that Reddy's argument was presented in two parts. The second half of the book is Reddy's attempt to offer a case study by applying his theory to the French Revolution. I am totally incompetent to evaluate this portion of the book and so will leave that to other reviewers. However, I did find his theoretical constructs to have explanatory power given what little I know about that period.<br />Give this book a try. It deserves a far wider popular audience than only one review on [Amazon.com] would indicate. I would compare in ambition and scholarship to Charles Taylor's Sources Of  The Self. If you learned from that book (and how could you not?) you will enjoy Reddy's. And even if you do not feel up to writing a review write me and let me know what you think.	2003-06-05

There has been an ongoing and vigorous debate in the philosophy of history for the last thirty or so years concerning the ways in which postmodernism should or should not impact the writing of history.<br />In this delightfully polemical book, Richard Evans does not try to engage the writings of the major postmodernists. Do not expect to find counterarguments to the writings of Derrida, Foucault, Lyotard or de Certeau. It is in the writings of thinkers like Hayden White, Frank Ankersmit, Dominick LaCapra, Keith Jenkins, Elizabeth Ermath, Joan Scott, etc. that the major claims of the postmodernists have been made for history in the English speaking world. It is with their writings that Evans engages in debate. This does not, however, put him in the camp of conservatives like Gertrude Himmelfarb, John Vincent, David Harlan and Keith Windschuttle.<br />Evans is arguing for a middle position- one that emphasizes the recalcitrance of the \\"facts\\", i.e., the historical records. Evans denies that all of history is interpretation and that no one interpretation is better than any other. He believes that careful and honest shifting of the historical record will show some or one interpretations to be better grounded in that record than others. On the other hand, he is excited by some of the possibilities for history that have been opened up by those working historians whose work he admires and who are identified with the postmodern camp, e.g., Simon Schama, Theodore Zeldin and Orlando Figes.<br />One of the main points of his critique is that Evans feels that postmodernism removes the possibility of any sort of critical perspective- he reiterates the old point that if there is no grounds to prefer one interpretation over another, if there is no such thing as a fact than there is no reason to prefer the views of the standard histories of the Holocaust over those of a denier, e.g., David Irving.<br />This is not the best of the books I have read recently on historiography. Berkhofer's Beyond the Great Story retains that distinction. It does have the advantage of being very well written, very clear in it's presentation and quite enjoyably feisty. Evans' style is like that of a good lightweight- constantly circling, jabbing his opponents, sensing a weakness and then throwing the combination.<br />If you think my pugilistic metaphor to be inappropriate, ... for a series of short essays Evans wrote in reply to his many and equally nasty critics. This site is probably the best way to figure out if this book is for you.<br />As for me, I have come to realize that this is a debate without end. Evans did not really settle anything for me. Neither has anyone else I have read lately. He does give you a lot to think about and he points the reader in the direction of a lot of interesting work done by other people.yond the Great Story retains that distinction.

Consider the following quote from the final chapter: \\"A new form of reflexive history would resolve the dilemma by...seeking to operate in the conceptual spaces posed by  the contradictions between textualism and contextualism, between social and rhetorical construction of reality, between normal history and metahistory.\\" (p.266)<BR> I consider this quote important because Berkhofer is actually trying to practice what he preaches in his writing in this book. He is summarizing the results of the critical work done in history in the last thirty or so years by at least two major schools of criticism. The schools are (roughly) 1. deconstructionist (or textualist or rhetorical) and 2. oppositionist (which includes social constructionist or multicultural or feminist critiques).<BR> The critical approaches are as rough on each other as they are on what Berkhofer calls normal history, i.e., history as practiced by professional historians. Therein lies the rub. Berkhofer is not trying to sort out the arguments for us. He points out all the possible ramifications of these critical schools he can think of in regard to a particular topic and does not really even indicate which he thinks is the most correct.<BR>Berkhofer wants readers and historians to start thinking deeply about the way they construct histories. He wants us to examine the rhetoric employed to express arguments or to emplot narrative, to what extent history is shaped by the institutional practices or the politics of the profession, what theory of social groups or of individuals does the author use and what is the author's theory of time (cyclical, degenerative, progressive, pastiche, etc.). What is the author's epistemology, how does s/he see the structure of power within both their own culture and the one they are writing about (are they liberal, radical, republican, conservative and how does that reflect on the history they write)?  As a personal aside, if you think this is not an issue with truly professional historians then you should read some in the liberal/republican/protestant debate that rages about the Revolutionary and/or Federalist periods in American history.<BR> The above is about one third of the issues that Berkhofer feels that historians and their readers need to start thinking deeply about if we are to face up to the challenges presented by the critical schools mentioned above. Along the way, he summarizes the work of dozens of scholars and practices some of the type of reflexive criticism he is suggesting on many others. However, he very much leaves open the avenues that \\"reflexive history\\" should explore. The last thing he wants to do is impose his own hegemonic regime on the new field.<BR> I have a mixed reaction to the book. I have learned quite a bit from it. I am going to make a conscious effort to read histories in the future in some of the ways he suggests to see how helpful or revealing it is. <BR> However, it is also an annoying book. It is full of jargon (how many times do we have to see hi/story to get the point?), it could have used an editor that read it a little more closely and ultimately I think Berkhofer should also have let us know his own thoughts on many of the issues between the contextualists and the textualists.  He has no trouble letting us know the inadequacies of liberal pragmatist historians like Thomas Haskell or James Kloppenberg. Why not do the same for Hutcheon, Rooney, Carrard, de Certeau, White, etc.?  He is fond of suggesting the use of different typefaces as a means of  demarcating different voices in a text. Perhaps he could do the same in his own book- one allowing for the \\"spaces of contradictions\\" in the arguments of others and another for his own thought?<BR> One final thought- somewhere in the book, Berkhofer tells us the story of a Native American student of his who refused to read an assigned text because the author referred to the theory that  the ancestors of the American Indians came across the Bering Straits thousand of years ago. This did not jibe with what he had been taught in the creation myths of his heritage. The student felt that if the author got that wrong, how could he be trusted at all?  To which I say- too bad.  Am I supposed to include everybody's creation myth (including the Bible) each time I write a text of evolutionary theory? We do not all have the responsibility to preserve everybody's traditions. At some point all we have to do is say what we ourselves think.<BR> This is not a book for everybody. Most casual readers of history do not need to read it. In spite of one of the reviewers below, you will not be washed aside (by what-the vanguard of the radical deconstructionist historians?). Those of us who do like to read our histories critically, with a suspicious eye, would do well to study this book. It is a difficult and annoying read but I, for one, have not read anyone else who raises so many important issues in one volume.	2003-02-15

One of the great revelations I had in college many, many years ago occurred in the stacks of the library. I was doing some research on Wilhelm Dilthey and found myself looking at several thousands of books devoted to the history of philosophy. At that moment I began to have some idea on how difficult it is to acquire a magisterial overview of any field of inquiry. It takes a lifetime of study and the mastery of several languages to develop have such an overview. And sadly, that knowledge sometimes gets pored into a book that relatively few people ever read.<br />This book by Georg Iggers represents that level of learning. Iggers specializes in German intellectual history but has read deeply in the historical work done in Italy, France, England and the U.S. of A. as well.<br />What he is trying to do in the brief book (147 pages of text, 23 pages of footnotes) is to give an overview of the most influential approaches to history of the last century. His work is divided three main parts. The first section covers the latter part of the 19th century and the early 20th. This period is dominated by the influence of Ranke and his ideas. Iggers also discusses the influence of Weber, Troeltsch, Meinecke, Karl Lambrecht, Parrington, Beard, Becker and many others that were involved in these early disputes. Obviously, Iggers can only cover a few of these people in any sort of depth but he seems to have a gift for summarizing the main point of a debate in a few lines.<br />One note of caution: with any such survey, I cannot help but wonder how accurately the author is expressing the views of those s/he is writing about. Iggers interprets Dilthey in a way that I disagree with but which is common enough. This is the only time in this book that I found myself disagreeing with his presentation except for that on Hayden White. More on that later.<br />The second part of the book covers the period just before and after WW II when the other social sciences began to make their influence felt in way history was practiced. Iggers talks at length about the body of work surrounding the journal, Annals . He also covers the work of the Historical Social Science school in Germany (Hans Wehler, Eckert Kehr, and Jurgen Kocka among others) as well as Marxist historiography from that period (people like Maurice Godelier in France, E.P. Thompsom and Christopher Hill in England).<br />This second part of the book was the most informative for me. I was ignorant of many of the Germans and obviously haven't paid enough attention to the work of Braudel. Iggers is great for orienting yourself to explore some of these schools of history.<br />The last section is on the postmodern critique of history, the development of schools of microhistory, and the rise of schools of history focusing on women or ethnicities that are outside the grand narrative of Western History.<br />I found the most interesting subsection to be that on the Italian school of microhistory. Carlo Ginzberg is probably the best known proponent to those of us who can only read English. Proponents of this school feel that large scale theories about history do not represent accurately the life experience of the actual actors of history. Their focus is on a much smaller scale- the semiotics of a village during the lifetime of one person.<br />And now for Hayden White. I have never been able to read Metahistory. That may be more of a reflection on my inadequacies as a reader rather than White's as a writer. Iggers summarizes White's argument as something along the lines of all historical writing must use the same rhetorical devices of emplotment as does fiction therefore it has no more truth value than fiction. If this is really what White's argument amounts to, it borders on the absurd. I find myself wanting to give White another try just to confirm my suspicion that this does not really represent his argument adequately.<br />This is a bit of a quibble however in regards to this excellent volume by Iggers. This survey could profitably be read by most sophomores or juniors majoring in history or philosophy in college. The writing is clear, the scholarship is daunting (especially in regards to the German historians) and the presentation is pithier than my review (sigh). Iggers may be a little unfair to some of those he discusses but he does his job as well as it can be done, I suspect. It really is up to the reader to go from there.<br />As for myself, even though I have read in the philosophy of history off and one for over twenty five years, I still learned quite a bit.

US	50300521	RWGTFCFGFUVD4	0801865352	980355969	Objectivity Is Not Neutrality: Explanatory Schemes in History	Books	5	23	24	N	N	The writings of a deeply philosophical historian	This is a deeply thoughtful book. Thomas L. Haskell is an excellent historian who brings to his reflections on his craft a deeply informed philosophical bent. This book is a collection of his writings from over twenty years.<br />The first thing to note is that the title of the book may be somewhat misleading. It is the title of a review that he wrote of Peter Novick's great book, That Noble Dream, on the history of the historical profession in the United States. Haskell's main thrust in that essay and the others that make up the middle section of the book is that objectivity is a social process to which individuals contribute provided that they have or develop a willingness to submit to perpetual criticism. To Haskell, the core skill required is the ability to suspend one's own POV and to \\"enter sympathetically into the alien and possible repugnant perspectives of rival thinkers\\" (p.60- my emphasis added). This is much more effortful than it sounds but more on that later. This whole section of the book is an examination of how the ideal of professionalism developed, what it entails, what constitutes its philosophical and political justifications and how it gets practiced or not practiced currently. One of his many points that is worth pondering is to recognize that most of what we take for granted as our commonsensical knowledge of the world is based on expert opinion. \\"If there is anything at all that justifies the special authority and trustworthiness of community-sponsored opinions, as I believe there is, it lies in the fact that these truth claims have weathered competition more sever than would be thought acceptable in ordinary human communities.\\"(178) This is worth thinking about- to the extent that the research programs of science and the humanities become corporation or nation state directed is the extent to which we should become more hesitant about taking their \\"community-sponsored opinions\\" at face value. One of the sad ironies of the current state of science is that even though our knowledge of the world gets increasingly arcane and complex and therefore increasingly hard for us to judge, the grounds we have for trusting experts seem to be increasingly shakey.<br /> One of the things that I like about Haskell's book is the way he takes the time to develop subtle arguments. The third section of the book is an example of this. Haskell puts forth an original and powerful thesis that is a variation of the old idea that it is anachronistic to judge the past by the standards of the present. Haskell goes deeper than that. He is interested in what he calls, \\"the conventions of moral responsibility\\" (238). These are the rules for assessing blame, responsibility and praise. Haskell's point is that over time more and more of our societal and personal life has come to be seen as something that we have control over. This has occurred in part because we have come to have an increasingly rich repertoire of recipes (Haskell's term drawing on the work of philosophers H.L.A. Hart, Douglas Gasking and Joel Feinberg) that allow us to accurately work our way to a desired result. As the recipes spread in use through out a society and as it becomes increasingly possible for individuals to control the shape of their future, the arena of moral culpability grows. We cannot be held accountable for what we cannot reasonably change. We can be held accountable for not living up to everyday standards. Haskell applies these ideas to the rise of the humanitarianism during the late 1700s and early 1800s. He points out the example of abolitionists like Wendell Phillips who early on in his career maintained a distinction between the exploitation of slaves and that of poor white laborers. At some point in the 1800s it became less common to assume that the lower classes of whites were completely responsible for their situation. Up until then, their plight had been seen to be the result of their moral laxity or their inability to master the arts of self-mastery. As the culture began to acknowledge the possibility that the working poor may not have much control over much of the circumstances of their lives, it became less possible to hold them accountable and reformers like Phillips showed greater and greater sympathy for their plight.<br />Haskell feels that the rise of capitalism was instrumental in the developing of the culture of humanitarianism. I will leave it to you to read his book to see how he develops this argument. Regardless of how you end up judging his success (I found his argument to be more intriguing than convincing), I believe you will be persuaded by his idea that such a history of the conventions of moral responsibility is necessary in order to have a true appreciation of the past.<br />As I said at the beginning, this is a deeply thoughtful book. It does not stake out popular nor easy positions but challenges the reader to really engage the past in a way that may be as revealing about our own moral presuppositions as about those of the period or people we are studying. I found it to be very much worth the time and effort of careful reading.f-mastery.

It does not stake out popular nor easy positions but challenges the reader to really engage the past in a way that may be as revealing about our own moral presuppositions as about those of the period or people we are studying. I found it to be very much worth the time and effort of careful reading.	2002-11-12

This book is one of the best books I have read on the ideology of the revolutionary and constitutional periods in American history. It deserves to be read alongside the works of Gordon Woods, J.G.A. Pocock, Joyce Appleby, Bernard Bailyn and all the others who have done so much to reveal to us the full complexity of that marvelous period of time.<BR>This period of our history has undergone an extended period of bitter contestation in the last few decades. At one point, the predominant interpretation of this period was that it was one of Lockean liberalism. The theory was argued by historians as different as Leo Strauss, C.B. Macpherson and Louis Hartz. Then came the extraordinary work of Woods, Bailyn and Pocock as well as Carolyn Robbins, Douglass Adair and others. This work suggested that the American Revolution was perhaps best seen as the last act of a renaissance political philosophy- the republican politics of civic humanism.<BR>Whitehead once suggested that the history of philosophy could be seen as a series of footnotes to Plato and Aristotle. Perhaps the historiography of the American Revolutionary and Federalist Periods for the last thirty or so years could best be seen as a series of footnotes to Hartz and Pocock.<BR>Kramnick seems to me to suggest the best answer to this debate: everybody's right. The founding fathers and mothers were extraordinary people and we do them a disservice if we see them as single minded ideologues. We want to use them as trump cards in current political and ideological debates but they are more, much more than that.<BR>Yes, many of them were Whigs who saw the politics of their times in terms of the corruption of political or civic virtue. But many of these same were Protestants and budding capitalists who were starting to define virtue in terms of the industriousness, the abiltiy and talent of the individual. Kramnick is an excellent guide to the interplay of these diverse ideologies. He wants to reassert the importance of Locke. I think he is right to do so. It is hard to read the writings of those times and not hear the echos of Locke. One can hear it in the writings of Jefferson, of Madison, of Paine, of Hamilton, of James Burgh.<BR>This book is a sure and fair minded guide both to the historigraphical debate and to the period in question. Kramnick is to be congradulated on his modesty. Unlike many intellectuals, he seems to know that his ideas have limits and that others may be as good or better guides to some of the issues he discusses.<BR>It is a shame that this book is out of print and only available as a used book. If you love this period of our history, if you are fascinated by the intersection of political philosophy, practical theory of governance, assertion of the primacy of individual liberty (usually by slave owners), the protection of class and property interests, by all the wild contradictions that this period offers, this book is for you. Read it alongside Woods, Adair, Pocock, Powers and all the others who are trying to lay out for us that wonderful and strange brew that is the history of those times.<BR>p.s.

Read the reviews below and note that some of the reviewers tend to regard McDonald as an advocate for the States and some read him as an advocate for the Feds.<br />Readers will tend to find in this book evidence to support their own views. That should suggest that McDonald has succeeded in giving us a fairly objective history of the issue. I feel he has. Sort of.<br /> The first part of the book does seem to meander. That is the nature of the beast. I have never read any comprehensive history of constitutional history that does not meander. Many different issues were argued during the first sixty years or so of our constitutional history using States Rights on one side or the other. I think you would be very hard pressed to name one major national figure in that time frame who did not argue both sides of the debate at different times in their lives or in regards to different issues. Madison, Hamilton, Jefferson, Jackson, Webster, Clay and Calhoun all are associated with one side or another on the issue yet all at some point in their careers argued the other side.<br /> Individual states showed their flexibility on these issues as well. In the chapter on the period immediately preceding the Civil War, 'Dissolving the Union', McDonald notes that the North began to preach nullification while Southerners began to praise the Court.<br /> The latter part of the book probably seems more focused because the issues were more focused and the positions of the players more dogmatic.<br /> I suspect that most of us still find ourselves on both sides of the debate depending on which issue we are discussing. As an Oregonian, I have been annoyed recently by the Federal government trying to contravene the wishes of the people of my State in regards to the Death with Dignity Act. On many other issues, I have supported that same Federal government when it interfered with the laws of individual States, e.g., in the case of laws nationalizing voting rights. Now, before, y'all jump all over me for inconsistency, ask yourself in you are not in the same boat. And while you are at it, ask yourself if most political issues do not involve making a decision on more than one constitutional issue. And whether how much of a role that States' Rights play in our reaction to an issue depends on our feelings about the other constitutional issues involved.<br /> Consider that the political and economic issues debated in this country have always had that type of complexity and I believe it will be clear why McDonald's history is not a nice flowing narrative.<br /> While I think McDonald's history is useful, I find myself questioning some of his judgments. I think he has a tendency to make statements that are not supported by evidence. On p. 120 McDonald claims, 'Jackson brought such disrepute to his office that that vital function of the presidency could scarcely be performed again for the remainder of the century'. This strikes me as a wee bit of an overstatement.<br /> I also find his handling of certain events to be questionable, e.g., the notorious caning of Charles Sumner by Preston Brooks. McDonald seems to feel that Sumner was malingering. Maybe. Maybe I would feel like malingering too if struck repeatedly on the head with a gutta-percha cane. In any case, I remain a little skeptical about McDonald as pure historian. But don't take my word for it. I am just some schmuck who reads a lot. Read one of his books and decide for yourself.<br /> If the issue of the relative power of the States vis-a-vis the Federal government is of interest to you then this is a useful book. If you have a strong opinion you will find additional support for either side within these pages. If your opinion on these issues is unclear, this book should be of use in sorting out some of your ideas simply by the way you find yourself reacting to the various arguments.<br />One final note- in evaluating what happened to the South after the Civil War, it is important to also keep in mind the monumental and systematic terrorism that was unleashed on black people during this time. The reaction of Southerners to Reconstruction is probably the strongest argument for federal intervention in the political lives of the states. The protection of minorities from the majority was one of the main reasons Madison and others pushed for the writing and ratification of the Constitution. Which minority is the focus of that protection at whatever historical moment is one of the story lines of our constitutional history. It is altogether too easy to forget this when reading a book like this one. I cannot recommend highly enough Eric Foner's great book on Reconstruction as a general background to reading about the era.the various arguments.<BR>One final note- in evaluating what happened to the South after the Civil War, it is important to also keep in mind the monumental and systematic terrorism that was unleashed on black people during this time.

It is well-written, thoroughly researched and very well thought out. I want only to add a few specific points that might further perk your interest.<BR> Keyssar is able to present succinct summations of complex historical and legal issues. For example, one of the themes of the final historical chapter is to outline how the Warren Court developed the standard of  \\"one man, one vote\\". In a few brilliant pages (pp. 298-302 of the paperback edition), Keyssar gives a synopsis of just how complicated and convoluted even this standard can be. Keyssar points out that this standard works only where there are no structural biases to the way that the individual votes are aggregated. A simple example: in my home city of Portland, OR, we elect our city councilors at-large. For a majority white city, this has the consequence of making it more difficult to elect minority councilors. Keyssar lays out the complexities of the debates on the resulting issues from this line of thought with clarity and fairness.<BR>For me, another of the pleasures of the book was learning about some lesser known moments in our national history, e.g., the Dorr War in Rhode Island in 1841-1842. This is part of one of the overall themes of the book, which is the class bias that has always been (and still is) part of our politics. Keyssar is very good at explicating how both parties have played that game.<BR>One final point that Keyssar makes and which is worth reminding ourselves of in light of the last election. There is no constitutional right to vote for the President for any of us.  To quote: \\"... the Founding Fathers, in writing the Constitution, declined to institute any national suffrage standard at all: for pragmatic political reasons of their own, they left to the states the power to determine the contours of the franchise\\"(P. 329).   There have been subsequent Amendments and Voting Acts all phrased negatively to limit the state's ability to disfranchise certain voters or from using certain techniques to disfranchise but nothing that positively asserts the individual's right to vote. <BR>Keyssar in his afterword written post-Election 2000, points out that the Supreme Court of the United States affirmed that fact in it's majority opinion in Bush v. Gore. <BR>Keyssar quotes that opinion, \\"The individual citizen has no federal constitutional right to vote for electors for the President of the United States unless and until the state legislature chooses a statewide election as the means to implement its power to appoint members of the Electoral College...[and] the State...after granting the franchise in the special context of Article II, can take back the power to appoint electors.\\" To our current crop of Supreme Court judges, that means, as Keyssar points out, that the presidential electors (and thus the President) \\"need not be chosen by popular vote at all.\\" Now that is States Rights for you with a vengeance. If there is an afterlife, John C. Calhoun loves Justice Scalia.<BR>Whether or not you agree with Keyssar's point of view (which he states very clearly), you cannot help but learn from this book. He presents an enormous amount to think about in a lucid and interesting fashion. I definitely agree with all of the reviewers below- this is one of those books that everyone should read. Not all will agree with it's conclusions but it would start and improve many an excellent debate and might inspire some action.	2002-05-26

If you have read my reviews of the first two volumes in this biography you already know my opinion of Remini and of his subject. Suffice it to say that if you are serious about learning about American history these volumes are for you. Not only are they an excellent introduction to many of the political and social issues of the era but they also allow the reader to wrestle with our national proclivity toward uncritical hero worship. Our past leaders were every bit as complex, as flawed and as human as our current crop .... What follows is a small portion of what I have learned from Remini's hard and honest labors.<BR> Jackson's accomplishments were extraordinary by any standards and some of them are quite ironic. He very much believed in states rights yet he probably did more to strengthen and expand the executive part of the federal government than any President until Franklin Roosevelt. Consider the following (all discussed in Remini's volume):<BR>1. He was the first President to use the pocket veto. He was the first to use the veto power for nonconstitutional reasons. We are so used to our Presidents using the veto because of policy disagreements with legislation that we forget how much of a shift this was in the balance of power as envisioned by the original generation.<BR>2. He reformed every department of the federal government and greatly expanded the bureaucracy as a result. He eliminated much of the graft that was rampant at the time and (at least, gave the impression of) greatly democratizing the civil service by making it more of a meritocracy. All this inevitably led to more people working for the government. A lot more people.<BR>3. Jackson changed the relationship of the various Cabinet members to the President. He was the first to fire a Cabinet member because of a disagreement over policy. Up until then Cabinet officers and ambassadors, because their appointments had to be approved by the Senate, were regarded as being accountable more to Congress than to the President.<BR>This is only a partial list of the ways that Jackson's Presidency changed the stature of the Executive branch of the government.<BR> Jackson's ideology (as I see it) comes from him trying to work out the tensions between his state's rights philosophy with his military experience, which taught him the necessity of a clear uncontested chain of command with his love of and trust in the people. I will comment on only one portion of that dynamic. Like so many of our leaders, the tensions in Jackson's ideology led him into conspiracy theories. He believed in and trusted the American people to always make the right decisions (the ones he would have made) and almost always credited any electoral reverses to cabals acting to befuddle and delude the populace. <BR>As a result, he became one of ablest early advocates of putting a good spin on the issues. Early on in his first term he helped to establish a newspaper that served as the official organ of the administration. Altogether, Jackson was a fascinating and maddening character.<BR>I find myself greatly in the debt of Remini. Jackson has always repulsed me by his blatant racism and his paternalism. Remini has humanized Jackson quite a bit for me. I am more appreciative of Jackson's great accomplishments and I have learned quite a bit of the politics of the time. I will be reading Remini's book on Van Buren next along with Seller's biography of Polk. One of the ways that I evaluate the work of a historian is by how much they increase my interest in further reading on their subject and on the period in question. By this standard, Remini belongs to my first rank of American historians.	2002-04-20

During the course of writing these volumes Remini became more and more convinced of the centrality of Jackson's life in the development of this country. Each of his volumes takes this theme and developes the argument in a different way. In volume 1, Remini focused his attention on how Jackson's early military and political career resulted in the vast expansion of the American territory. In this volume, Remini is focusing on how Jackson's first Presidency can be seen as both a renaissance and a remodeling of the republican values that inspired the revolutionary generation to their acts of rebellion and to the founding of a new government. <BR> Those of you who have read my review of the first volume know of my personal dislike for Jackson as a racist and as a violent bully. During the period covered in this book, Jackson comes off better as a person and more efficient as a racist. I am not going to go on too much about Jackson's treatment of the Indians. Remini gives you all the details and has recently written another book focused only on this part of Jackson's life. This is one of the few areas of interpretation that I disagree with Remini. He is a little too willing to write what happened off as inevitable and the product of the time. I will only suggest that there will be many Germans who at some point in time will start to say the same thing. At what point does the passage of time start to imply inevitability and to act as an excuse? Enough on this.<BR> On to the good stuff. This volume is a brilliant work that combines the terse lucid synthesis of the work of other great historians with Remini's own patient and detailed research. I cannot tell you how much I have underlined parts of this book or copied passages into my commonplace book.<BR> In the opening chapters, he lays out the evidence for his thesis that the era of Monroe's presidency was rife with corruption. Jackson became convinced that the government was devolving into a system of patronage, bribery and influence. It seemed as if the President was starting to be able to appoint his successor in that the Secretary of State had usually become the next President. At this time there was no opposing party to the Republican party.<BR> Jackson became the most important single factor in the development of the Democratic Party and indeed bears much of the responsibility for the way the two party system operates today. During the course of his presidency Jackson made major strides in turning this country over from being a republican form of government to a democratic one.<BR> One does not have to read any of the founding fathers very deeply to realize that the original Revolutionary generation had an abiding fear that the people would gain too much power and initiate a form of tyranny especially threatening to the moneyed classes. A good deal of the origin of the electoral college can be traced back to this fear. We couldn't have the people just electing anybody to the Presidency- there had to be a way that more responsible and sober citizens could brake runaway democracy.<BR> Jackson worked to reverse much of this during his tenure in office. He offered several constitutional amendments to eliminate the electoral college. He felt it had been used to subvert the will of the people in 1824 and that it would be again. While running for his second term he encouraged the use of a national nominating convention with freely elected representatives voting on the choices for the Vice Presidency. This was the first time this had been done. <BR> He allowed the working and lower classes into the White House and listened to their complaints and requests. He felt his role was to be their living embodiment. There is no denying that Jackson was a patrician (he owned 150 slaves) but he seemed to feel a remarkable identity with the commoner sort of people in our country.<BR> Jackson is also remarkable for the way that he expanded the power of the presidency during his administration. He used the veto power more times than all of his predecessors combined. He was the first President to use the pocket veto and the first to initiate legislation.<BR> All of the wonderful and bizarre complexity of the man is on display in these volumes. Remini gives wonderfully written and detailed explanations of the inside politics of the administration, the Bank War, the Nullification Crisis, his Indian Removal policy and Jackson's personal life. He hasn't changed my mind about the personal quality of the man but he has made me appreciate many of accomplishments of the man.<BR> This is truly an extraordinary historical work- one of the best biographies I have ever read. If you feel intimidated by the three volumes there is a one volume condensation available. But if you love American history go for the full work. These books will reward the time and effort spent absorbing them.	2002-03-20

This meticulously researched and wonderfully written book is the first volume in a three-part biography of Jackson that will undoubtedly set the standard for years to come.<BR> Part of what makes Remini's work so useful is that he does not rely solely on American sources but has also dug deep into the Archivo General de Indies in Seville, Spain in order to try to see Jackson from the viewpoint of the Spanish colonial government. It was this research that led Remini to his main thesis in this book which is that Jackson, thru his military exploits against the Indians of the southern United States (notably the Creek, Choctaw, Cherokee, Seminole and Chickasaw tribes) and against the Spanish in Florida did as much or more than any other individual to extend U.S. territory into much of Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, and all of Florida. One of the more interesting revelations of the book for me was the mutual admiration and the shared goals at this point in their lives between Jackson and Monroe's Secretary of State, John Quincy Adams.<BR> In fact, Remini makes a good argument that Jackson's military exploits in that region were is what enabled Adams to deal so successfully with the Spanish in negotiating the Trans-Continental Treaty of 1819. This treaty formalized the recognition of the European powers of the territory added to the U.S. by Jefferson in the Louisiana Purchase. Up until then the purchase was widely recognized as illegal.<BR> So why don't I give this book a higher rating? I think that Remini falls prey to a common tendency of American historians who take on the task of writing the lives of our great men. As a reading public, we do not seem to want to acknowledge the dark side of our leaders or our history. As a result, it is difficult to write biographies that do not border on hagiography. Remini for the most part avoids this failing. He is clear about Jackson's violent (murderous, really) temper, his tendency to bully others until they gave in and his paternalism. This is not a man I would have wanted to know.<BR> Where Remini does not quite live up to his own standards is in regards to Jackson's (to my mind) overt racism. Jackson regarded the presence of the Indians anywhere in territory that was being settled by Americans as unacceptable unless the Indians were willing to give up their tribal territories, accept a farming plot and become good little American citizens. Remini tries to convince his readers that Jackson the paternalist hated only the tribes not the individual Indians and that therefore Jackson and his policies were not racist (see the discussion on p. 337). I leave it up to the reader of this review whether this defense is adequate. I think that the last fifty years has amply proved that a racist can befriend individual members of the hated group as long as that individual keeps their place. I think that this is actually a rather common type of racism and Jackson exemplifies to a plentitude. To be fair to both Remini and Jackson he had a life long history of defending the underdog if they applied to him for protection.<BR> Of course, this makes Jackson a paragon of the southern culture of the time but we also need to be honest about our own history. Jackson was a racist, he initiated Indian policies that were, at the least, marginally genocidal (the Indians called Jackson, Sharp Knife) and he was still one of our greatest men, one who had an enormous influence on our historical destiny. Remini, the good honest scholar that he is, gives us enough material and detail so that we get enough of the story so that we can sort out our own vision of the truth.	2002-03-04

I am not a man of faith. I do not believe in the existence of God and I believe the whole issue is unimportant. More important than the existence of God (which is a question neither side can settle) is the question of how to live our lives now. I came to this book as I always come to religious writings and practices; will this help me to understand others or myself better? Will this teach me to be more loving, to live more mindfully, with more compassion?<BR>From this point of view, this is a wonderful book. Not because it answers all questions (or any questions for that matter). If anything it creates more ambiguities, it raises more challenges. That is a good thing. Many of the other reviewers seem to react to Thich Nhat Hahn based on whether or not his is the True Buddhism or just one man's opinion. Fair enough. But unless you are so fortunate as to have some sort of satori or God decides to drop in for a chat what else do you ever have but one person's opinion? It seems to me that what we all do is find something that seems to make sense to you, a practice that carries you along your path and you practice. Thich Nhat Hahn will help most readers to do this. This is a man of extraordinary faith who is apparently equally diligent in trying to live his faith. I do not know about the other readers but this man is a wonderful and unnerving challenge to me in my ideas on how to live my life. <BR>Throughout the book the author suggests very simple practices to improve mindfulness and diligence. He calls us back to the breath always. In my experience, whether doing yoga, tai chi, chi-kung, kung fu, meditation or just plain living this is always the beginnings of real practice.<BR>The presentation of Buddhists dogma that the other reviewers find so wonderful or controversial is, I believe, very well done and is as clear as could be hoped. It is also very arcane. I was not aware that there were Twelve Levels of Independent Co-Arising, Seven Factors of Awakening, Six Paramitas, Five Powers, Four Immeasurable Minds, Three Bodies of Buddha, Two Truths and, yes, a Partridge in a Pear Tree. Sorry, I could not help myself. My point is that a lot of this part of the book is probably most useful after having been read, lived and read again. For someone looking for a true introduction, this part of the book will seem a little much. Parts of it seem a little PC as well such as the occasional emphasis on sex abuse. I cannot imagine that was a burning issue back in the days of the Buddha. This is not a problem for me- it just shows that the author's religion is a living one. <BR>Wonderfully though, what also comes through, is the author's spirit- that of a gentle, compassionate and strong person. I have not read any of his other books. After this I will read more. I have already found some of the practices helpful and will continue to try to integrate them into my life. Give this book a chance. I do not think it will answer all of your questions. How nice would that be if we could get that from a book? It will give you a deeper understanding of Buddhist's beliefs and practices. Some of the practices suggested may help you to live your life. What more could you hope for?	2001-10-31
