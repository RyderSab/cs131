Dallas was the type of man women, at least grounded mature women, would love to settle down with. He was respectful, not just after quick sex, and a wonderful single father. His sister Carmen let herself become a victim of a user but I was glad when she found her true self and no longer allowed a man to define her. Priest was a complex character full of surprises. All of this turned the novel into a quick, enjoyable read. Thanks Travis and keep them coming.	2005-04-12

I started reading it on the plane and finished it the next morning. It was off the chain. Mister Mann Frisby is a talented brother and I hope he gets his rightful attention. He certainly deserves it. His character development is on point, his storyline was comprised of a lot of elements that people try to sweep under the rug in society, i.e. some women being sorry parents and having a lax attitude about whom they lie down with and make babies. I loved the main character Sticks and I enjoyed his ingenuity of not revealing his real name until the last third of the book. I was going crazy not knowing it but I think that was the author's point.  <br /> <br />Sticks is a single father who lucks out, or at least thinks he does, when he discovers that a Teletubbies tape has a whole lot more on it than children's entertainment. In an age where so many entertainers and athletes are getting caught in sex scandals, this is a timely book. The arrogance of those who assume they can do whatever they want and not have to pay for their actions amazes me so this was a \\"real book.\\" Sticks had to deal with a lot of drama, greed, and betrayal and even though he was far from perfect, I felt compassion for him because he was a man attempting to do the right thing the best way he knew how. I would highly recommend this book to anyone desiring a rollercoaster of a read.	2005-04-12
US	51122824	R7NQ6AFGIEYXA	0976029200	901848833	Harlem's Dragon	Books	5	8	8	N	N	An Overlooked Gem	I am a huge supporter of self-published authors, having started out as one myself, so I often purchase books based on that fact alone. Such was the case when I came across Harlem's Dragon a couple of months ago at Karibu Books in Maryland. I had never heard of it or the author but loved the cover and bought it. I finally got around to reading it and was throroughly impressed by the author's writing style, character development, and story concept.  <br /> <br />Chemah, the main character, is a man who has made some wise and some bad decisions in his life, mainly when it comes to women. He marries an aggressive and ultimately obsessive woman who loves sex and the control she can have over men by using it to her advantage. All of the characters have interesting issues and personalities and that makes up a good book, in my opinion. <br /> <br />A lot of people reviewing books make comments about how hot sex scenes are and how they compare to my books and that I better watch out or move over. While I find it amusing since I am on bestseller number nine, they are totally missing the mark. It is not about sex scenes; it is about what leads up to them and why readers care about what is happening between the characters engaging in sex. That is what erotica is and David Rivera has it going on in that department.  <br /> <br />But he has more talent than that. This book is a combination thriller/erotic/relationship novel that keeps it real from page one to the final word. I am surprised this is the first review of this book. That means people have been sleeping on this book and that is a shame because it is certainly a worthwhile read and one of the most entertaining books on the current market.	2005-04-03

The Broker has an excellent storyline but it dragged in places when the author gave intricate details about Italy and the language lessons.  They somehow detracted from the book from me so I am holding back that fifth star. With that said however, I would suggest this book for anyone intrigued by different countries and who is a lover of his previous works.	2005-04-03

This book proves my point. The characters in this book, everyone from Dante to Donna to Shorty to Taniesha and last but not least, the First Lady and Bishop, come to life throughout the pages. As a preacher's kid myself, I am well aware of all the stone-throwing and freakiness that goes on behind the scenes in a congregation. The main people looked up to in the church are often the most scandalous of the bunch. I really loved the Dante character because he was a \\"real man\\" who did not rely on his sex organ to make his most important decisions. He was forgiving, loving, and compassionate; everything most women want in a man but fail to find or often overlook similar to the way Taniesha almost did in the novel.  For a fast-paced entertaining ride, you can never go wrong with a Carl Weber novel. This one is definitely a conversation piece that I am sure bookclubs across the country are eating up. I loved the excerpt from his upcoming novel and can't wait to read it.	2005-04-03

Kelly Robinson raises his game with each consecutive novel that he pens. This is no exception. The Strong Silent Type is a wonderfully engaging tale of two people caught up in life and all the pitfalls that it brings. Yet they manage to keep sight of the important things in life and that is a rarity. So many people harp on the negative instead of drawing from the positive. <br /> <br />Deacon's stuttering problem is a nice twist to a classical romance. There are many people living with that problem and others that cause them to have low self-esteem. I applaud Robinson for tackling the issue head-on and showing that what makes us different can also make us special and unique. I fell in love with the Deacon character and the Maria one was equally as unforgettable. She was a real sister who had gotten into the wrong man and the wrong things early on in life but turned her life around, which is commendable. It shows that we can overcome our mistakes and move on to achieve something more positive. <br /> <br />I would suggest this novel to anyone and I hope that the masses will discover it. It is truly a story that will touch people right where it counts: in the heart.	2005-03-29

I am so glad that clubs exist that give exposure to untapped literary talent. That is what happened in this case. <br /> <br />I had never heard of this book even though it has been out for quite some time but I am glad I did and enjoyed it immensely. The main character, Ross, is the epitome of racist having been raised by parents who trained him to feel above others. He finds himself living in the projects after attacking a black man who wanted his representation as a literary agent. Finding himself out of his element, he is still full of venom until a grandmother and her grandson rescue him from being slain. They care for him despite his obvious snobbish attitude toward them. What happens is a \\"change of heart\\" as the title suggests. <br /> <br />I loved this novel because it shows that even though we are conditioned from birth to have certain beliefs, we can learn differently if we are willing to accept change. This reminds me of an independent film by Keith Plummer called Mentality that deals with a similar concept. <br /> <br />I am looking forward to Mr. Watkins next offering. This one was definitely worth my time and held my attention, something that happens less and less these days with the books lining the shelves with redundant storylines. Thanks for writing something unique.	2005-03-29

The characters are not flawless, which means they are like actual people and not picture perfect.  They have flaws, they make mistakes, they love, they hate, they hurt, and that is what life is all about.  I read this book while I was in the emergency room right before Christmas and though ill, I could not put it down.  As someone who reads every day and does acquisitions for a publishing house, that is saying a lot because it is often all too easy for me to toss a half-read book onto a pile.  Pete is a fantastic author who is coming into his own.  This book will make people think, it will make people realize that you cannot escape the past, and it will have people remembering the characters and the storyline long after the last page.	2005-01-04

I decided to purchase it because I had heard the title before.  I returned to my hotel that night, opened it, and never put it back down until I was finished.  A quick, easy read, this book is not one for people seeking a \\"deep book.\\"  However, it gives an interesting spin on what happens to people after we die and how those we cross paths with throughout our lives all truly play a significant part in our existence.  The main character is killed while trying to save a child from being hurt on an amusement park ride.  Once he gets to heaven, he sees people he had almost forgotten all about and they each teach him a valuable lesson about his life.  The author has an incredible imagination, one I can't help but admire, and this is a cute book (about a heavy subject--death) that most would sincerely enjoy.	2004-11-28

I was honestly surprised by how much I enjoyed reading this historical fiction.  The main character of the book travels to the United States to live with a maternal aunt and her husband after her grandfather who raised her dies.  She is accused of being a witch because she knows how to swim well and because she befriends an elderly woman who lives by Blackbird Pond.  It is a story of romance, of forgiveness and of family bonding.  I would suggest this book to both young and older readers alike.	2004-11-27

The storyline had a lot of potential but like so many others have said, the story was not flushed out enough and the characters were seriously underdeveloped.  However, I do believe the author has potential so I have purchased his second novel and will see if there is a vast improvement.  After all, we must all start somewhere and writing is about growth with each project.  I think he has the ability to tell a better story but if you are just looking for a fast read to kill some time, this book is so-so.	2004-11-27

Blackfunk III, like its predecessors, is a compelling novel about crime, sex, and love. Presley has a contemporary voice that draws readers in from the first page and it is hard to put any of his books down.  I would agree that the series should be read in order but even as a stand alone book, this one carries its own weight.  I look forward to his next novel, one that is excerpted at the end of Whatever It Takes.  Presley remains one of my all-time favorite authors.	2004-11-27

I stayed up all night completely caught up in the book and finished it in less than 24 hours.  I was glad to see a new storyline involving both the Wolf and the Weasel.  They have always been villians to reckon with.  Once again Patterson made Cross a likable human being full of determination despite his flaws.  The Wolf character was a bit confusing but that is what made the book interesting to me.  That a person could be so cunning and evil and convince so many others to sacrifice for him.  I found the bombings and terrorism to be plausible  because of today's society.  I can't wait until the next Alex Cross novel drops.  The first ten were just a teaser of what is to come.	2004-11-27

I happened to pick it up in a train station on the way out of town and liked the title.  While I could appreciate the great details and forensic evidence revealed in the book (much like Jeffrey Deaver's Lincoln Rhyme) the book moved just a little too slow for me and took me a while to finish.  I enjoyed the protagonist Kimberly Quincy.  She was a complicated soul with much baggage after the murders of her mother and sister at the hands of a madman.  I could feel Kimberly's pain as she frantically searched to find at least one victim alive.  The only thing in the book that seemed unrealistic to me was the Nora character having slight psychic abilities.  It might have been better to bring her back into the realm of things in another manner.  I do intend to read other books by this bestselling author because I like her style.	2004-11-26

She has a way of taking a difficult subject and writing about it with ease.  From the very beginning of the story, some women will be able to relate to the plight of the daughter.  Many have been there and done that: had to use sexual favors to stay afloat.  When you add the mother Esther, who has to be one of the most self-centered characters ever portrayed in books, into the mix, the novel becomes a real page-turner.  This is definitely a good selection for anyone looking for something different.  As always, her writing is excellent and flawless.	2003-12-07

I was a huge fan of his first novel Pipe Dream.  It was as real as it gets and so is The Bridge.  The author manages to draw the readers into the characters so much that you actually feel like you are bearing witness to their lives, their dilemmas, and their pain.  When a young girl comes up missing, people who have hated each other and ignored each other for years band together to try to get her home safely.  Accusations and blame are thrown all over the place, leading to a climatic ending.  What I really enjoyed about this book is how the author showed us what some young children must endure on a daily basis in order to merely survive.  It is a serious wake-up call.	2003-08-17

It was outstanding.  The author has a remarkable way of telling a story and his characters come to life vividly on the pages.  <br />I truly felt for Lincoln, the protaganist of the story, and how he had to make choices (whether right or wrong) in order to survive.

I picked it up and started reading it without having the slighest idea of what it was about.  I did not even read the back cover.  I just knew it was a Gloria Mallette book so I purchased it and dug right in.  <br />The book is riveting from page one.  I was captivated with the relationship between Meika and her single father Troy.  When tragedy suddenly struck, I was shaken because it was totally unexpected since I was reading without forewarning.<br />The torment of losing a child is one that no one ever wishes to go through.  I truly felt compassion for Troy's parents as well as for Meika.  The fact that her mother was a recovering addict and totally unfit to be a parent was unnerving as the court system once again failed by allowing her to take custody.<br />All of the characters were wonderful but Vann was my favorite.  He was a strong young man who stepped up to the plate without hesitation to soothe the pain of his parents, handle all of Troy's affairs and track down his murderers.<br />Mallette has once again given her readers a tale to remember.  For those that love a good mystery mixed with a complex tale of family love and devotion, this is an excellent choice for summer reading.	2002-06-23

He shows us that who we become as adults is directly related to what happens to us during our childhood.  He does it in an entertaining way instead of a &quot;preachy&quot; way and his writing is extremely smooth and entertaining.  The four main characters in the book all have emotional baggage left over from their childhoods and it shows in every action they make.

Johnson has written a sequel that will keep readers riveted to their seats wondering what will happen next.  Beginning five years from where the first book left off, we are reintroduced to Julius Harris and the sons he abandoned during their childhood: Austin, Marcus, and Caleb.  <br />Julius' cancer has gone into remission and he feels like he has a new lease on life; especially since his youngest son Caleb is being released from prison and coming to stay with him.  The only problem is that Julius promised to look after Caleb's woman and child.  Unfortunately, the woman had other plans and moved on with her life.  Caleb is heartbroken and determined to find them.  Ultimately, he finds them shacking up with a violent drug dealer.<br />Marcus is now married and expecting his first child.  He has decided to cut his brothers out of his life: Caleb for refusing his attempted prison visits and Austin for seemingly neglecting his children.  However, Marcus' wife is not having it and insists that he does the right thing.<br />Austin is separated from his wife and in the middle of ugly games involving his visitation with the children.  He is mad because his wife allows them to spend more quality time with his brother Marcus than with him.  Accusations and fists start flying and one wonders if there will ever be a resolution.<br />Well, the book finally does bring closure to the family issues when Julius' cancer returns tenfold and the three sons must decide whether to forgive him or not.  The scenes in this book between father and son, brother and brother, and husband and wife are so overwhelming that it brought me to tears.  This is definitely one of my favorites of the year and I highly recommend it.	2001-11-21

Well, I found the book in a local bookstore recently and sunk into the brief 168 pages the next day.  Chance and Roberta have been married for years.  After trying unsuccessfully to produce a child for a long period of time, they resort to drastic medical techniques.  Roberta does become pregnant and the couple has never been happier.  That is, until Roberta insists on going to an amusement park in her third trimester.  Michael and Lauren, their best friends, agree to go along and the day turns out to be unforgettable.<br />Michael insists that they stay a little longer and go on one more ride.  Roberta selects the ferris wheel, one of her childhood favorites and something slow enough for a pregnant woman to deal with.  Unfortunately, the negligence of the ride operator and a faulty safety bar transform into a series of tragic events.  Roberta plumments to the ground and ultimately to her death.  The baby is recovered by C-section but only lives a few minutes.  After the burial of the two, the guilt and accusations sink in.<br />Believe it or not, this is where the book truly begins.  Fueled by obsession and determination to replace the wife and child he lost, Chance becomes a madman, a stalker, a killer. Eric L. Bowers weaves an erotic, suspenseful tale and will leave readers desperate to see the movie that nobody can seem to find.	2001-11-20

Here it is Monday and I have already read it and LOVED IT!  Tahira is a hilarious storyteller and definitely one to watch in the near future.  The book covers a few months in the life of your average 21-year-old African American woman.  Her name is Na'Imah but people just call her 'E' to prevent themselves from jacking up her name.  She is involved with a brother named Aaron, who thinks he is the master playa but really ends up playing himself.  <br />Throughout the short novel (130 pages) readers are delighted with Na'Imah's escapades that run the gamut from sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll (actually, hip hop in this case).  The book contains some of the funniest scenes I have ever read, mostly because I am from the D.C. area like the main character and can picture everything she is saying.  From trading three puffs of ciggaweed at the Wendy's drive-thru for some extra chicken nuggets to her girlfriend Amber that follows her around stores trying to buy the exact same clothes Na'Imah selects for herself, this book is a keeper.	2001-11-05

His father was murdered in the middle of bedding down the next door neighbor after Malcolm had spent his entire adolescence witnessing his father make a mockery out of women.  His mother was the greatest victim of all but stayed with his father because he was the only love she had ever known.<br />After charging high school classmates fifty dollars each to escort them to their proms and figuring out he could get away with it, Malcolm turns to the gigolo life and for twelve years, charges women two hundred dollars an hour to wine, dine, and blow their minds.  But even playas get tired of playing and Malcolm's thrill is gone once he lays eyes on Toni, a graceful dancer who steals his heart after a gutsy performance on stage.<br />Simon, Malcolm's best friend, owns a successful nightclub in Atlanta.  In between jet-setting from Chicago to Los Angeles, Malcolm spends some quality time in Atlanta with his buddy.  Simon has his own problems, including a club manager with sticky fingers and a fiance that is fed up with his lack of attention.  Simon has neglected Cynthia by dedicating so much time to his flourishing business so she turns to a shady minister for sexual satisfaction.  <br />Ariel, who replaces the thieving club manager, is sick of her mother pressuring her to settle down.  As a last resort, she turns to a dating service and ends up involved with a stalker followed by a married man.  Ariel is looking for a mixture of handsome looks, financial stability, and toe-curling sex.  Eventually, after getting mixed up in a few violent incidents, she realizes that what she was looking for was in front of her the entire time.<br />The Maintenance Man is a quick, fun read.

This time by Paul, a man who professed readiness to settle down even though he was on a personal mission to satisfy every woman who was being satisfied at home.  After catching Paul getting busy in their own bed, Andria hands him the proverbial walking papers.  <br />Rashaun is a successful man who has also been hurt one time too many.  After discovering a sex tape labeled &quot;blackfunk&quot; that contains the love of his life engaged in consensual rape with his best friend, he decides that he will never fall in love again.  As usual, one should never say never.<br />Temptation and loneliness draw Andria and Rashaun to each other like moths to a flame.  The only question is can they commit to one another while deep-rooted issues are still hanging over their heads.  On top of the obvious trust issues, Andria comes from a dysfunctional family and Rashaun has always felt the pain of being nicknamed &quot;Blackey&quot; because of his complexion.  <br />Then there are their friends, who have just as much emotional baggage as they do.  Andria has a married girlfriend that is still acting like she is single and bedding down men at will.  Rashaun has a friend that thinks he was put on this earth to get his freak on and nothing else.  Then there is Paul, Andria's ex who attempts to make her jealous by hooking up with one of her friends.  <br />Filled with erotic sex scenes, informative dialogue about the history of &quot;blackfunk&quot; dating back to slavery days, and witty twists in the plot, Blackfunk is a different kind of read that will have readers mesmerized long after the last page has been turned.	2001-11-05

It took merely an afternoon to read it but the storyline draws you in and grips onto you until the conclusion.  I really would have liked to see more.  It is a rather short novel.  However, being a fan of the Godfather trilogy, Goodfellas, Hoodlum, and other gangster flicks, this novel definitely reads like a movie and would be interesting to see on screen.  There are no sugar-coated parts of this book.  The author keeps it real and I can truly appreciate that.	2001-10-16

If not for reading an email about the novel, I never would have known it existed.  The following day I was at the bookstore, saw the dramatic, enticing cover, read the synopsis on the back, and decided to give it a try.  I could not put the book down.  I locked myself in a room and read the book from cover to cover.  <br />The book starts out with a prominent Hispanic politician being murdered in a crack house. Samuel Jackson AKA &quot;Black&quot; isn't even present when the incident happens but his friend Leroy, while innocent, is all up in the mix.  Guilty by mere association, the police begin a massive manhunt for Black and Leroy, who are on the lam with two female addicts.  <br />Black was once a man who had it all: a home, a wife, and a son.  Like so many people, he got a little taste of crack and life as he knew it ceased to exist.   Leroy could have been anything he wanted to be, but drugs got a vise grip on him also.  Black and Leroy are the walking dead.  They have no dreams.  They have no goals.  They have no ambition other than making sure they have drugs when they are ready to get high.<br />This novel is powerful for so many reasons.  First, it is a powerful example of why people should just say no to drugs.  Secondly, it is suspenseful and reads like a movie.  Jones keeps it real by stressing the fact that African American men are often scapegoats in the justice system.  Thirdly, Jones is a magnificent writer and hopefully will get the recognition that is so well-deserved.  Anyone that can make a reader sympathize and even route for four crack addicts is a writer to watch.  This book is a wake up call.  I just pray that the people who can be most effected by it have it shoved into their hands by a concerned friend or family member.	2001-09-17

While this book did not bring me to tears like A Lesson Before Dying, it did move me in many ways to read how much the elderly black men endured at the hands of white men early on in their lives. They dealt with so much that they all decided to gather with their weapons and simultaneously confess to a murder that none of them committed.  The basis of the storyline itself is ingenious and worth the read.  Ernest Gaines is definitely a master of the written word and he proves it yet again.	2001-09-05
US	51122824	R23E5HMPQNOWGD	0446607738	702895641	Toyer	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Extremely Impressive!	I cannot explain how caught up I was in this novel from page one.  Only two other books come to mind that captured my attention so immensely during the first chapter.  Toyer is not a serial killer, even though he turns successful, ambitious, beautiful women into living dolls for sport.  He stalks these women, learns all about them, and then uses his charm to get invited into their homes, drug them, and use a surgical utensil to stop their brain functions.  What is even more disturbing is that these women are told during their drug-induced state that they are &quot;next.&quot;  Toyer asks them what they were planning on doing the next day because they both know it will never happen.  They all know of him and dread the thought of lying in a dormant state for eternity with their friends and family surrounding them with lost hope.  A fate most would consider worse than death.  <br />Toyer is smart.  He knows that by not killing he could never be sentenced to death.  In fact, the act of criminal mischief only carries a relatively short prison sentence.  What is even worse is the motive behind his actions.  One would have to read it to believe it.  <br />Maude is a psychiatrist assigned to the living dolls.  They have become her children and every time she receives a call in the middle of the night alerting her that another young lady has been found, her anger grows deeper.  She lashes out at the police and district attorney's office that are seemingly doing nothing because they are more concerned with actual homicides.  She ends up reluctantly teaming up with Sara, a local, overzealous reporter that is also determined to bring Toyer down.  After Toyer personally attacks Sara and &quot;toys&quot; with her emotions, making her prepare for the inevitable, he simply walks away.  He is messing with them big time, proving that he is in charge and can and will get away with whatever he chooses.<br />Maude, even though she is put on suspension for speaking out in the media, begins a regular conversation with Toyer in Sara's newspaper in an effort to talk humanity into someone who has none.  Toyer loves it, he loves the attention, and the editor-in-chief of the paper loves the sales.  So what's next?  Toyer decides that he will write a book, describing chapter by chapter how he ruined the lives of women that had everything going for them.  A publishing house agrees to pay out millions of dollars for the book but Toyer decides that he wants the money divided between the families of the victims.  What a psycho!  <br />There is so much I could say about this book because there is so much to be said.  It is a big book--482 pages--but it is captivating, scary, and downright entertaining all at the same time.  Even more than that, it is believable and that is what is most frightening of all.	2001-09-05

Secondly, I have lived in North Carolina, right on the outskirts of Charlotte.  Third, because the main character could be anybody's child who loses his or her way due to peer pressure, unbridled lust, or just plain old lack of common sense.  Thai, the main character, kills a man over a woman more so on principle than love and also because one of his friends so kindly or so stupidly places a gun in his hand.  He flees DC until he can ascertain whether or not he is a suspect in the murder and goes to visit his childhood friend who has relocated to North Carolina.  His friend has pretty much started over with a job at a family-owned business, a decent woman, and material possessions that are attractive to Thai.  Thai still dreams of going to college, even though he has done what so many recent high school graduates do: put it off for a year or two or three or forever.  I truly enjoyed this novel but would like to know what decisions Thai made upon his return to DC.  Did he turn himself in and confess?  Did he at least tell his father?  Did he decide to accept the open invitation and move to North Carolina?  Did he ever return to school?  Hmm, now that I think about it, all these questions would make up an interesting sequel.  Hopefully, one is forthcoming.	2001-09-05

Add all that up and you have a realistic, entertaining, hilarious sophomore novel that will have you up all night glued to the pages to find out what happens next.

The cover and title caught my attention so I started to read it and could not put it down.  The main character, Susan Given, a DA, was interesting to say the least.  She is on the edge of a breakdown, more than likely from being overworked, and decides to take a friend up on a vacation offer.  She ends up on an island where she befriends a native named Ascension, only to bear witness to his killing weeks later.  She returns home to NYC, only to have to end up dealing with the same people from the island in the long run.  While I felt that a little too neat and convenient as far as storylines go, I did find it ingenious.  Susan has to deal with an impending divorce, an overzealous boss, raging hormones in her two daughters, an oversexed niece, and an array of other problems all at once, including a serial killer aptly named Rice Krispies.  I would definitely read another &quot;Given&quot; mystery and plan to order Given the Crime right now.	2001-08-20

A woman that had been repressed sexually by her husband for the entire length of their marriage who finally decided to take a walk on the wild side.

It shows throughout the novel in his descriptive dialogue and ability to craft a story.

Thad wanted to live his life his own way and not the way that his father or girlfriend had envisioned it.

Jeffrey Deaver is the master of suspense in my humble opinion.  No one weaves a thriller together quite like he does.  His latest novel, The Blue Nowhere, is no exception.  Phate is a killer, a killer that finds out every intricate detail of his victim's life beforehand by snatching the root directory of their computers.  He is a hacker, the best of the best, a wizard and there is only one person that can stop him: another wizard.  <br />Wyatt Gillette is trying to quietly serve out his three-year sentence at a federal penitentiary for computer tampering.  However, he jumps at the chance to help track down a killer when the local authorities arrange to get him released for 72 hours.  He gets even more excited when he discovers that the killer is one of his old running buddies.  Wyatt and Phate had founded The Knights of Access together, both geniuses in their own right.  But there was one slight difference: Wyatt did it for fun, just to see if it could be done, and Phate did it for evil.  So they parted ways and now it is time for them to have the ultimate showdown.  Typing more than 100 words per minute, trying to outsmart each other, the police fade into the woodwork as they go after each other for vengeance, glory, and for the love of the game.  <br />This is not a good novel.  This is a great novel.  If you have never experienced a Jeffrey Deaver ride, this is a good place to jump on the bandwagon.	2001-05-15

Something that is causing African-American authors to speak freely about sexuality. This freedom of expression seemed non-existent as recently as two years ago. It was considered taboo. Now, all bets are off. Such is the case with Got To Be Real, a collection of four original love stories penned by some of America's most famous African-American male authors. In Caf Piel, Eric Jerome Dickey takes you on an escapade with Bobby as he travels to Mexico in search of a man that owes him thousands of dollars for photography assignments he was commissioned for. During his time there, Bobby--one of the characters from Dickey's novel Friends and Lovers, falls for the sexy Alejandria. Alejandria is involved with John, the man that Bobby has come to find. It is a story of forbidden intimacy that is entertaining and well-written. In Kenya and Amir, Marcus Majors clues us in on how Amir, the brother of Myles--the main character from his novel Good Peoples, gives up his playboy ways and falls in love with Kenya. By the time you get to Good Peoples, Kenya and Amir are married with twins and it was delightful to gain firsthand knowledge of how Kenya won over Amir's heart. Marcus Majors is extremely gifted, especially when it comes to dialogue, and is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors. In Money Can't Buy Me Love, E. Lynn Harris talks about the romantic dreams of James Whitmore Thorton. James is sick of fly-by-night love affairs and is searching for a man to settle down with. The only problem is that when Mr. Perfect finally walks through his door, so do all of his secrets. It was refreshing to see E. Lynn Harris step away from his infamous character Basil and I look forward to seeing him doing that more often. In I'm Still Waiting, Colin Channer takes us on a detailed journey to Jamaica where Michael Chin-See, a legendary music producer, comes out of semi-retirement to help boost the faltering career of the lovely Patience Olayinka. As always, Channer's descriptions draw the reader in and makes it seem like you are actually there. While I would like to give this book a four, I can't because of the poor editing job done by the publishing house. I don't know if there was a tight time frame that had to be met, but I was very disappointed that a major house would put a book on the market that has so many errors. After awhile, they begin to take away from the pleasure of the reading experience.	2001-05-14

That is something I have never experienced before in a fictional book.  It was rather frustrating at first but the storyline grabbed me so I continued on.  Burdon Lane is an arms dealer.  He works for UniArms full-time as a front but his real career is dealing in the illegal stuff.  He and his buddies don't just throw some guns in a trunk and hit the road either.  They have elaborate plans involving Fed Ex trucks and falsified paperwork just in case they get questioned.<br />Burdon is asked to make a run with some of the fellas and they have to take the U Street Gang from D.C. with them.  It is a bad mix because racial slurs and tension fog up the air.  Burdon is paired with Jinx, a cool brother that doesn't even flinch when someone points a loaded gun at his head.  They get to the &quot;point of sale&quot; and all hell breaks loose.  Instead of a customary drug deal, the U Street Gang is being set up for the assasination of a famous African American figure.  <br />From then on, bodies start dropping like flies and Burdon and Jinx, two people who can not stand each other, end up as the most unlikely of allies.  They are determined to clear their own names, stay alive, and put some type of method to the madness.  If you are a big fan of ganster novels, this is a good one.	2001-05-14

Richard has been married to Estelle for eight years and while he  loves her deeply, there is a serious threat to their relationship. Namely,  Estelle's mother Rubylee. Rubylee is a woman who has always managed to get  whatever she wanted by utilizing two things: her criminal instincts and her  vagina. She will stop at nothing to get the material things she craves,  which is why her gold-digging behavior wreaks havoc throughout Richard and  Estelle's marriage. Not to mention Estelle's &quot;welfare queen&quot; sister who,  along with Rubylee, doesn't believe in an honest day's work. Richard has had  enough of the leeches and decides that he is sick of being &quot;taken for  granted.&quot; On the flip side, you have Nina who has been married to Jay for more than  twenty years. Jay believes in being in total control of his life and his  woman, even if that means keeping her from pursuing her educational and  professional goals. They have a daughter with her own set of issues and Nina  is tired of turning her head to the obvious. She also has had enough. Richard and Nina have known each other in passing for years. Richard  occasionally attended Nina's aerobic classes, moreso to admire her than for  health reasons. Ironically, they both end up in the Caribbean on vacation,  searching for answers to their separate dilemmas. Now this is the part of  the book where you might need to have a glass of ice water standing by to  cool you off. That's all I am going to say on that. :-) Taken For Granted is a refreshing read for people who have found  themselves in their forties wondering what in the hell happened to their  lives, their aspirations, and their sanity. A person doesn't have to give up  on hope just because everyone else around them has. That is the lesson in  this novel: no matter how hard life gets, with the right determination and  wise decisions, it can always get better.	2001-05-14

I guess I am just spoiled by the Alex Cross series because every single time James Patterson steps away from it, I am left in a state of disarray. However, unlike the other times he has ventured off, this time he came up with an incredible concept. Someone is killing people but not just any people. Someone is killing couples that have been married for less than 48 hours. In one case, less than a single hour. The killer keeps mumbling, &quot;What is the worse thing a person could do?&quot; Well, if ripping the dreams and hopes away from people who have just embarked on a new life together isn't the worst, I shudder to think what is. Linsey, a homicide detective in San Francisco agrees, and she is hell bent on solving the cases. So much in fact that she forms the Women's Murder Club consisting of herself, a district attorney, a medical examiner, and a reporter. Together they begin to unravel the madness and nothing and no one are what they seem. If you are James Patterson fan, this is right up your alley.	2001-05-14

Not a semblance of love but real love; unconditional love; emotional love.  In a million years, I never thought I would be able to relate to this book but I had heard so many wonderful things about it that I just had to purchase it and I am so glad that I did.<br />While I have known less than a handful of people that have done prison time and have never been involved with a man that has served, this book goes much deeper than that and deals with the issues that any woman must deal with at some point in her life.  What issues?  The definition of love and what we seek from a man.  A lot of women search their entire lives and never find what asha bandele found as a visiting poet to a penitentiary.  She found Rashid, a Muslim serving twenty years with life tagged on behind it for second degree murder.  She found a man that understood her, a man that listened to her rid herself of all the demons of her childhood, a man that did not judge her when she revealed her previous promiscuous behavior, a man unlike her previous husband who was there physically but never touched her body or her soul.<br />asha's word are so vivid and detailed that they are almost arousing in nature.  I pictured all that she went through: the humiliation of being searched when she visited him, the negative comments from friends and family members who simply could not understand how she could love a convicted felon, the pain and anguish of her decision to have an abortion instead of trying to raise a child alone.  While I felt her pain, I also felt her joy.  The joy of a man telling her that she is perfect despite her physical imperfections.  The joy of being able to get to know a man mentally for years before sex came into play.  The joy of knowing that no matter what else went wrong in her life, someone loved her unconditionally.  This book has truly helped me see the light.  It has taught me to never take things like the ability to hold hands or lie beside a lover, even in moments of anger, for granted.  I think that every woman should read this book because the honesty and candor of her words, the thoughtfulness of letting people into her life through her memoir, makes one realize that if she can heal, so can all of us.	2001-05-14

After his wife Willie Mae deserts him, taking the kids with her, Johnny gets into serious trouble with the law and finds himself on the run. On his way to New Orleans, he makes a little detour and ends up with a disgruntled housewife, Shirley, and her son. Shirley is so determined to get away from her husband that she jumps at the chance to leave with Johnny, a complete stranger. Johnny realizes the errors of his ways yet again when he finds out that Shirley's husband is the head of a crime ring after he sends a couple of his henchmen to New Orleans to bring his wife and child home.  Despite one bad turn after another, Johnny still finds the time to get involved in the civil rights movement that eventually leads to the Voting Rights Act. He even finds time to shake hands with Martin Luther King, Jr. For those that enjoy books with historical value, The Devil to Pay offers an extremely realistic opportunity to experience some of the discrimination our parents had to endure.	2001-05-14

While at first, I was hoping she would shout out her problems to the world to put an end to the anguish, I grew to appreciate the author letting it drag out for years.  Why?  Because it really happens like that.  I was watching a talk show the other day and the guest was a woman that was abused by her stepfather from the ages of 3 to 27.  The characters in this novel are flushed out beautifully and you will be riveted to the pages.  Mary Monroe did a wonderful job with this novel and I can not wait to read whatever she publishes next.	2001-05-14

I first read the novel when I was in junior high and the only thing I remembered from it was this freaky movie theater scene. That and the fact that it was good. Now that I am grown, I took a lot more away from it this time.<br />Francie is twelve and growing up in 1930's Harlem. She has two older brothers who have totally different aspirations in life. One wants to be a hoodlum and the other wants to quit school to become an undertaker. Her father, a number runner of course, is too proud to go onto public assistance and that causes a lot of turmoil between her parents. She has a best friend that likes to beat her up most of the time. Old white men try to feel her up whenever they get a chance. Francie really endures a lot for a person her age. If you are into period novels, this is a must read because it gives insight in a generation we know nothing about.	2001-05-14

I doubt that  anyone who reads it will walk away without saying, &quot;Dang, something like that  happened to me once!&quot; It is just that real.  I love the way that the novel is broken down into three sections that  portray the relationships between different couples: Chris and Tamara, Jamal  and Shameika, and Stephen and Deandra. Chris is stunned that a woman has  touched him as deeply as Tamara while Tamara is dealing with serious trust  issues. Jamal is the type of man that every woman dreams about but Shameika  is not ready for him. She is a playette with emotional problems stemming  from her childhood. Stephen has been a playa his entire life, believing in  tasting every flavor of the rainbow, until he meets his match in Deandra who  didn't have any intention of commiting, especially to a man like Stephen.  All of the main characters go through transformations in this novel, just  like everyone goes through them in real life. Even better is that the men  are hanging buddies and the women are all sistergirls. That way you are  afforded the opportunity to witness interaction between all of them and get  to know the characters in depth, even when their particular intimate  relationship is not the center of attention. The sex scenes are hot, the drama is in high gear, and the three stories  flow together with ease. This is definitely a must read for 2001 and will  surely become a classic: a book that our children will read when they get to  the stage of seeking out Mr. or Mrs. Right. I would not dare give away the  juice. You will just have to pick up the novel when it hit the shelves and  drink it in with your eyes. Trust me, there is never a dull moment. That in  itself is a blessing as some novels tend to drag on without offering anything  substantial other than a high word count. LUVALWAYZ will have you riveted to  your seat. Shonell and JD do an incredible job of bringing the individual characters  tolife through their witty dialogue and actions. They have a true gift with  words and I have the feeling that their writing careers, whether partnered or  individually, will flourish in the African-American literary marketplace.	2001-05-14

Not only that, Massey does it with a tale that reads like a movie and keeps you turning the pages to see what will happen next. Jason Brooks is the typical teenager. He has best friends that he hangs out with, he has a cute little girlfriend that he dotes over, and he has been drooling for months over the perfect bicycle at the local store. However, Jason also has parental problems: his father is rarely home and his mother drowns her sorrows in alcohol and takes out her frustrations on Jason. One night Jason has had enough of his mother's abusive behavior and runs outside, climbing up the nearest tree. His imaginary friend, one he invented years before, talks to him causing Jason to lose his balance and fall only to end up in a coma. When he wakes up, strange things start happening. The bicycle he has always wanted ends up on his yard, his father starts coming home and spends time with both himself and his mother; things are just a little too good. Then the madness starts. Time begins to stand still while Jason and his friends are in the middle of various activities and they end up in this strange place that they appropriately nickname Thunderland. I don't want to say any more but I can honestly say that I never want to go there in real life and neither should you. However, it is a daunting, spellbinding place to visit throughout the pages of Massey's book. Massey is a wonderful author and his words leap up off the pages. This is a great debut novel.	2001-05-14

First of all, it takes you back to a simpler time and I have a predilection for novels that give some insight into what my parents and grandparents had to endure.  I have read several Cole Riley novels and the first thing that struck me was his ability to capture not  the dialect and surroundings of a time period, but also his ability to entwine that with historical facts.<br />Frank is a man's man who feels that his wife should be the proverbial &quot;barefoot and in the kitchen.&quot;  They have at least eight or nine kids when the novel starts out and Frank barely lifts a finger to help out with them.  Once one of their daughters drowns because of poor parental supervision, Frank snaps and can't deal with it at all.  Thus, he flees and ends up in the arms of a bisexual female whose jealous female lover will stop at nothing to get Frank out of the picture; even physical violence.<br />Back at home, Frank's wife has become involved with a playboy who spends his time sparingly between his two women.  The kids do not like their mother's new love interest and yearn for Frank to come home.  Add to that, the fact that Little Frank is mentally-challenged to the point where he exhibits violent tendencies toward his siblings.  Whenever Frank does make a pit stop, his wife tries to convince him that Little Frank will sooner or later snap all together.  Frank will have no parts of that theory and thinks it is all in his wife's imagination, even though he is missing in action the majority of the time.  Eventually, the unimaginable does happen and they are faced with the most difficult decision of all.<br />If you are looking for something different, I highly recommend Hot Snake Nights.	2001-05-14

I just knew it was going to be my type of book. Apparently my expectations were too high because I found myself highly disappointed. <br />The book did not grab me from the first page or even the fiftieth page. In fact, from page fifty until page two-fifteen, I was waiting for the roller coaster ride to begin. When I got to page one hundred, I paused to read the back cover again and figured that all the excitement the back matter promised would happen at any second. <br />Maceo Redfield has two best friends, Billy Crane and Holly Ford. Billy has been seeing Maceo's only true love, Felicia AKA Flea. One day while Maceo, known as the Watcher because of his astuteness between pitches on a baseball field, is waiting to get his hair cut at the neighborhood barber shop, all hell breaks lose resulting in Billy's death and Felicia's disappearance.<br />Because Maceo feels that Billy would have done the same for him, he decides to find out who killed his friend at any cost. Plus, he is still head over heels in love with Flea despite a new relationship. Thus, he tracks her down and gets her to reveal the truth. At least, the truth as she knows it. <br />While I feel the writer has a wonderful writing style and a delightful gift for dialogue, the novel simply didn't satisfy my cravings for suspense. Maybe if I had never read other novels like Whoreson by Donald Goines or Rough Trade by Cole Riley, The Dying Ground would have enticed me in some manner. However, I think I will pass on the sequel.	2001-05-14

For anyone that has endured family drama, which is everyone that doesn't live in a glass house, A Day Late and a Dollar Short will hit home big time.<br />Vy, the matriarch of the family, has been to hell and back during her fifty-four years. She has a husband, Cecil, who steps out when he feels like it until he steps out one time too many and ends up becoming somebody's baby's daddy in his golden years. She has a son, Lewis, that needs to run to the nearest AA meeting before his disease kills him and/or makes him end up in the slammer for the umpteenth time. She has three daughters: Janelle, Charlotte, and Paris. They are all going through men drama, kid drama, addiction drama, or all of the above. <br />The thing that is amazing about this novel is that you get to hear all of their distinct voices. That in itself, is quite an undertaking. One that McMillan pulls off seemingly with ease. The underlying premise of the novel is this: Make amends, institute changes, and live your dreams before it is too late. Do everything you have ever dreamed about: get an education, buy your dream house, tell someone you love them. Otherwise, you might end up like the characters in the novel, wake up one day, and find yourself a day late and a dollar short.<br />I give this novel 5 stars on the RAW Scale.	2001-01-28

Such is the case with Whoreson.  From the first chapter, I was hooked when I discovered that the main character's birth name was actually Whoreson.  His mother, Jessie, a prostitute, selected that name after she gave birth to him less than an hour after turning a trick.    Jessie, along with her mentor Big Mama, raised her son to do one thing: become a pimp.  He studied it like an art form, learned from those he considered the masters, and got his Ph.D. in Pimpology.    There are numerous women in this novel with low to non-existent self-esteem that allowed Whoreson to turn them into prostitutes when he was too young to even get a driver's license.  Especially Boots, whom Whoreson meets while she is pregnant and still tricking for her rent.  For those who have ever wondered what makes a person decide to stand on a street corner, whether male or female, and sell their bodies for money, this book offers a significant insight into their lives. This is not a pretty book, but being that the author lived the majority of it, makes it remarkable.    Whoreson, a semi-autobiographical novel that Goines wrote while he was incarcerated at the Jackson Penitentiary, is a fictional masterpiece.  In and out of jail seven times, Donald Goines was shot and killed in Detroit in 1974 while he sat at his typewriter working on his latest novel.  Having sold upwards of 10 million books worldwide, even though he has been given very little recognition in American media, I truly believe that we lost one of the best AA authors in history too young and too tragically.  I can only imagine how many other masterpieces he could have churned out, being that he wrote as many as eight in one year.  There is no one to compare him to.  To even attempt to compare him to another author would be an injustice.  If you haven't been turned onto Donald Goines yet, you are missing a world of incredible literature.<br />I give Whoreson a 5 on the RAW Scale.	2001-01-28

Curtis Bunn has penned an excellent novel on relationships from a male's perspective.  Julian, Greg, and Larry have a lot of  baggage (hang-ups about women passed on from past relationships with lovers, mothers, and friends).  Enter a slew of women boggled down with their own baggage and it gets extremely interesting.    At first, I was skeptical about reading the novel because I assumed it would be yet another relationship drama full of male-female bashing and stereotypes.  Not so.    The stories entwined into Baggage Check are so realistic, they will bring back memories for anyone that has ever loved before.  The three men in the book show that males can be sensitive to the needs of females and discover the true priorities in life.  Greg, after losing the only woman that ever mattered to him over money, realizes that the love of a woman is the most valuable asset.  Larry, the playa of all playas, meets his match in the form of the lovely nurse Renee, who leads him to not only love but also to the Lord.  Julian, after having his heart crushed by a straying lover, finally finds his ideal mate, giving up his self-imposed list of prerequisites (no children, no long distance, etc.)  Curtis Bunn is an author with a remarkable voice and I suspect he will be around for years to come.  His talent for details and descriptions is outstanding, but even they can't hold a candle to his talent for writing emotional-driven dialogue.  In a world of AA literature heavy-laden with mediocre relationship novels pushed onto the public by publishing houses more concerned with quantity than quality, Baggage Check is a step ahead of all the rest.  I give this novel a 5 on the RAW Scale.	2001-01-17

Sistaz Book Club<br />Tired of all the romance novels full of perfect people that seemingly walk on water gracing every single page?  Looking for something a little &quot;rough&quot; around the edges?  Look no further.  Rough Trade by Cole Riley is it!  All of us have best friends.  People who are there for us through thick and thin.  People who say, &quot;I'd give my life for you!&quot; Ask yourself this: What would you do if one of your friends actually did give up their life so that you might live?<br />Such is the dilemma for Velma.  After being caught in the proverbial wrong place at the wrong time, Velma's friend Claudia sacrifices her own life to save Velma's by begging their assailants to let Velma go and do as they wish to her.  Claudia's body ends up so butchered and brutalized that her family cannot even identify her body.<br />Shunned by Claudia's family and mutual friends, blamed for leaving her friend behind to die, Velma's guilt drives her out onto the streets of Manhattan.  A walking zombie, Velma doesn't care who uses her for sex because at least they provide a temporary buffer for the pain.  After descending into a world of drug addicts and sex for trade, Velma finally meets and falls in love with an aspiring artist.  With the help of her sister, Velma goes to counseling and even reconciles with her mother.  Everything is going well until...<br />...people around her start dropping dead and rumors start flying like wildfire that Claudia is not really dead.  That she is alive and on the run from some very nasty people.  Velma, determined not to let her friend down again, resorts to desperate measures in order locate and rescue her friend.  She ends up in the pits of hell, inside a house full of torture and death, simply because she cannot get over the guilt of betraying her friend.  But, will Velma ultimately be the one that is betrayed?<br />This book is outstanding and takes the reader into a world that, even if they could imagine it, they would never want to enter except through the pages of a book.  I give this book a five on the R.A.W. Scale.	2001-01-05

While a lot of people I discussed this book with seemed disturbed about Winter, I think  it was just a reflection of fear because the character was so real.  There  are young women walking the streets as I type this with the same  reflections on life, the same shallowness and materialistic outlook, the  same misconception that the right sexual techniques can get them everything  they ever wanted in life.  I know women like Winter, as frightening as that  concept is.  I could picture every page actually happening and to me, that  is what makes a book excellent.  Sistah Souljah has given me a lot to think  about.  How can I reach out and help someone that has fallen off the right  path?

She is just as avid a reader as me and I go over her house to get reading  material whenever I have run through all of my own.  Now I own a copy of  this book myself.  I just had to have it.  No book has come closer to  evaluating my real life.  If the things in one chapter didn't happen to me,  then they have certainly happened to someone I know.  I think this book  should be required reading for all women, no matter what their age or race.   It helps put a method to the madness of our daily lives and the things we  endure in relationships.	2000-08-05

The character development and backstory were both done beautifully.  Once my son is old enough to understand it, I plan to have him read The  Harris Men.  I particularly felt for Caleb and I would love to see a  sequel.	2000-07-19

I kept telling myself that this book would get better if I just gave it a chance but it never did.  I bought this book because of all the 5-star reviews and because it was number two on the rack in the bookstore where I  purchased it.  I only wish I could get my money back.  I give the author  two stars for effort but the book was just down right silly, unrealistic  and had extremely poor editing.  While I commend her for completing a  novel, I think I'll pass on whatever she writes next.	2000-05-22

Personally, I am confused about some of the previous reviews from people who couldn't appreciate Mr. Riley's talent.  I loved the book!  I read an average of 3-4 books a week and Harlem is hands down one of the best books  I have ever had the pleasure of reading.  His character development was  excellent, his descriptions of Harlem were outstanding and the storyline  was superb.  This book was in a word, the BOMB!	1999-03-08

I thought Chocolate Star was excellent.  The characters were well-developed, realistic because they had problems and the writer is  extremely talented.  I can hardly wait to read something else by her and  have suggested this book to anybody who will listen.	1999-03-08
