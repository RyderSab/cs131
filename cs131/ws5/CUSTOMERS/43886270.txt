While this is my least favorite among the Bloomwood stories, it was still a great read.  In this story, Rebecca's wishes seem to come true when she finds out that she has a long lost half sister.  She immediately assumes the best, and believes she has a new best friend.  Not to mention that the timing couldn't be better, since Rebecca's long time friend Suze, seems to have moved on and made new friends and experiences without her.  But nothing ever goes as planned in Rebecca's life, and she and her sister couldn't be any more different.  I found this story to be a little too unbelievable, but it was a fast read, and worth my time.  I hope you like it!	2005-07-16

But to anyone who knows the character of Rebecca Bloomwood, this is not an easy, uncomplicated task.  Between dealing with the planning of her pushy soon-to-be mother-in-law, and her own inability to make a decision, Rebecca finds herself in the middle of two completely different weddings...being planned on the same day...on two completely different continents!

In this book, she attempts to conquer her spending urges and get herself financially stable.  She ends up learning a lot more about herself and life than she had expected.

Having read all of Woods' Stone Barrington novels, I had no doubts that this book would be anything but great!<br />Will Lee is the President of the United States, and his wife is the head of the CIA.  Though they are advertised as the main charaters, I didn't feel that their parts were that involved in the storyline.<br />To quickly sum up the story, a highly trained assassin is killing very prominent figures in the US government.  Throughout the story you will follow those trying to track down this crazed man/woman, as they race this mad person before he/she kills others.  And as I hate to give away too much information, just know that this book is a fast read that you will not be able to put down until the end.	2004-06-21

It really took a different look at coping with the loss of a loved one.  The story follows a character, Holly, who recently lost her husband at a very young age.  The book follows her and her close friends through the year that follows.  Holly has received notes from her husband, one for each month, that are intended to help her move on with her life, in a positive direction.<br />I was amazed how on one page I was crying and at the next I was laughing, and two pages later crying again!  My only disappoinment with the book is that the age of the author can be seen in some immature aspects of the book, such as the partying and drinking of the characters.  However, it is still a great read, and I would recommend it to any female looking for a unique, quick read!	2004-05-22

As an avid reader of Stuart Woods, I was really looking forward to this book, where both of his series characters would meet up.  Overall, the plot of the story was great, but there were too many incidents that it all too unbelievable.  Stone and Holly managed to escape death too many times, and their personal relationship with each other was a little too hard to believe.  I have to give it 3 stars, however, for the good plot, and also the great continuation of characters, interlocking all the books together.  I really love that quality about Woods' writings, that he always brings back past characters.  However, I am still waiting on Arrington Carter to make an appearance in a Stone Barrington novel.  So if you are a reader of the series of Stone and Holly, then you definitely need to read this book to keep up with these characters.  If not, then I wouldn't recommend this book, because you would be completely lost in the history of the storyline involved.	2004-05-22

Through what some might call fate, Denise meets Taylor, a local volunteer firefighter.  There is an immediate connection and the two grow close quickly.  Through twists and turns, Taylor's past begins to get in the way, and the stability of their relationship is questioned.

I am a new fan of James Patterson, having seen the movie 1st to Die and recently read 2nd Chance.  Although I read this book in two days, it was only so that I could move onto something else, not due to an overwhelming interest.  Let's just say I was greatly disappointed with this book.<br />The plot of the book is quite simple...Peter Mullen is murdered, and his new lawyer brother decides that it was not suicide nor accident, but murder.  He sets out on a mission to prove who the was involved in the murder, but due to the criminals large income and influences Jack is unable to do so for quite some time.<br />That part of the story line was OK, but from there on it was all downhill.  I don't want to give the ending away to those who haven't read it, so let's just say that the ending was a little unrealistic.  Also, the book was quite vulgar to mankind, with Peter being involved in all kinds of sexual relationships.  I thought this gave the story a trashy touch that was unnecessary.  It helped out in solving the murder, but it could have been written differently.<br />Don't take my opinion as gold.  Read it and find out for yourself!	2004-01-02

Things get a little close to home as they start to become victims!<br />Some people say that this book was predictable.  While in some aspects it was predictable it was still full of surprises, so it was not a total give away.  I like a mystery in which I can speculate &quot;who done it&quot; and this book gives that opportunity.	2003-12-31

This book did a great job of capturing the feel of the show, but it is just not the same.  It is a great book, I just believe I enjoy the television show in all its drama better than the book.<br />In this story, there are two murders to be solved.  The first is a missing wife.  Her husband is suspected for the murder, but seems to have an alibi.  The second murder revolves around a stripper who is strangled on the job.  Everyone seems to be blaming her ex-boyfriend, but there is too much evidence that points to a female.<br />No matter how crazy the murders seem, they are never to hard for the CSI's of Las Vegas.

She was involved in a hit and run accident, with no witnesses, and only evidence that lead the investigation no where.<br />Miles can hardly get on with his life, and things do not get any better when his son's teacher, Sarah, tells him that his son is doing poorly.  She suggests a lot of individual help and offers her time after school.  Throughout the course of the school year, Miles and Sarah become good friends and begin having a loving relationship.  It is the first time in the two years since his wife's death that Miles is able to open up and begin to get on with his life.<br />A sudden twist occurs when it is discovered that Sarah is somehow linked with Miles wife's death.  Will he find out her secret?  And will their relationship last?<br />Overall the book was great.  I just thought the ending was a little weak.	2003-02-21

As the third book in the Holly Barker series, I believe Blood Orchid is the best yet!<br />Still recovering from the shock of Jackson's death and trying to move on with her life, Holly must now deal with attacks on her own life!  The book opens with Palmetto Gardens up for sale, and the high-bidders in a pool of blood.  Enter  Ed Shine, the highest bidder left alive, with a hefty 60 million purchase!  Palmetto Gardens becomes Blood Orchid Estates, and the corpses start piling up.<br />There are several attempts made at Holly's own life, and her new boyfriend/under cover FBI friend is not much help, since he and Harry Crisp (making an appearance in each book of the series) are both with-holding information from her...not to mention that someone has bugged her house.<br />Soon the intruder ends up dead in the river and Barker begins to investigate.  She ends up south of Orchid Beach with possible Mob involvement, a dead Russian, a suspicious restaurant, and more and more dead bodies.<br />Holly must determine who is bugging her and Ham's houses, who is trying to kill her, and why.  Is Ed Shine and Blood Orchid involved?  Or is this stemming from a past case and someone Holly put behind bars?<br />The story starts with murder and ends with murder.

I am typically a reader of Woods' Stone Barrington series, but since he cannot write them fast enough, I sought out his other series, in which this is the first book.<br />The Orchid series follow a character named Holly Barker, who is retired from the U.S. military.  She takes a position with the Orchid Beach police, and upon arriving the chief is murdered.  While getting accustomed to her co-employees, the Orchid Beach community, and her new friend Daisy, Holly must try to solve the case, while also investigating a mysterious 'members only' development called Palmetto Gardens.  And to top things off, the ex-chief hinted to Holly before his murder that he thought something 'suspicious' was going on in the department.  Holly must decide whom she can and cannot trust.<br />The book did tend to be a little unrealistic with the qualities of Palmetto Gardens, but overall if was still a great read.  A keeper for any Woods fan!	2003-01-14

Many friends have suggested reading Dean Koontz. From the comments they have made, he seemed to be the kind of author I would like. I have purchased several books that sound interesting and that I assume I will like. This book was the first that I have read out of those books. I hope that I was not led astray by my friends and I hope that this book is not a vision of what his other books will be like.<br />When I first started reading this book, I thought it was going to be great. I was really intrigued after the first few chapters, when Joe was trying to deal with the loss of his family, who died in a tradgic plane crash. It has been a year since the accident, and he cannot quite cope with his loss. Who could deal with this when you entire family is lost and world turned upside down? I believe the events of 9-11 made this more heart felt.<br />Then things started to go down hill. Families of other victims in the story started killing themselves, and a mysterious doctor seemed to be responsible. Joe starts to research this woman and discovers that she was the sole survivor from the crash. When visiting the crah site, he discovers that she was not the sole survivor, however, but that she did escape with a young child, Nina...which happens to be the name of his daughter.<br />Through the rest of his book, Joe is strung along, believing that he is helping this doctor woman who is hiding his long lost daughter and he will soon be reunited with her.<br />...<br />Perhaps the ending was my biggest disappointment of this book yet...I thought this ending [was bad]!	2002-06-27

Stone's job is to separate her from her lover, Lance Cabot, who is involved in some &quot;illegal matters&quot;.<br />John and Lance Cabot are always one step ahead of Stone, keeping him guessing as to the truth of what they really are after.

This is what Stone must figure out.<br />And of course, what book would it be without the appearances of Stone's old time flame Arrington and old NYPD partner Dino Bachetti.<br />I greatly enjoyed this novel and cannot wait for the next one already!

I have been following the Stone Barrington series, reading them all in sequential order, one right after the other. I do have to say that this book is not like the others thus far. I did not read this book with the passion to finish it because it was great. Instead, I wanted to keep reading it just so I could finish it and move on. It seemed to drag too much on Stone's personal life, which ended up not even having a real significance in the end of the novel. Take away all of this &quot;mush&quot; and the book still had the Stuart Woods mystery, suspense, and thrill. If reading the series, definitely read it, because you will miss out on a lot, but it is not one of my favorite Woods' novels.	2001-10-19

So he gets placed in the mental institution where he thinks everything is a party until he finds out he cannot leave until they release him.  The book really isn't too hard to follow, but if reading it for school, I would reccomend the Cliff Notes.  They always have those great hidden ironies!

I read this book quite some time ago and thought it was great...suspenceful, surprising, the whole nine yards.  However, I would not recommend reading the rest of the books in this series.  It gets kind of repetitous and annoying.  Just this first book will give you the idea of the theme for these books.	2001-05-30

Well, it is hard to write a review on a book like this, without giving away the ending!  So, I will just say that the threatening calls start again, and this book will keep you on the edge of your seat.  I enjoyed it and hope you do too!	2001-05-30
