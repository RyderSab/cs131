As with the previous Calamari/DiPasqua books I've reviewed, The Novena Book combines informative and readable text with stunningly beautifully illustrations in a manner few other manuscripts can match.  Their works grace my living room both because they are a treat to the eyes of my visitors and because I turn to them frequently for my own spiritual and educational formation. <br /> <br />In The Novena Book: The Power of Prayer Calamari and DiPasqua take a comprehensive look at the concept of Novenas.  The introduction highlights the powerful nature of this prayer format.  At the heart of the book is a lengthy series of chapters on Saints, Angels, the Madonna, and the Divinity.  Each section on the saints provides a brief biographical or informative statement, an illustration, and a Novena. Rounding out the volume are additional prayer resources and a helpful topical index.  The book features Novenas to several well known saints and to a few who make become your new favorites.  I'm looking forward to sharing Novenas with my sons as we anticipate the rapid approach of the holiday season.  The Novena Book: The Power of Prayer is the type of book you'll want to give as a gift, but be sure to purchase a copy of this treasure for your own spiritual library. <br />	2005-09-23

I learned about Paul and Joan Plum when I was lucky enough to run across their latest book Teach Me about a Church Inside & Out: Discussions and Activities for Children.  This simple yet expansive paperback introduces children and their parents to the various items related to our Church and Catholic liturgy.  Alphabetically, the book defines terms from Altar to Vestment, providing informative descriptions, outline illustrations suitable for coloring, and interactive elements to engage the reader.  I have found this book to be an excellent teaching tool with my own children, especially my young Thurifer.

In her new book Homeschooling with Gentleness: A Catholic Discovers Unschooling (Christendom Press, October 1004, paperback, 132 pages) takes a look at this \\"gentle\\" variation to the traditional homeschooling path.  As a mother of two Catholic school students, I must admit that I initially approached Andres' book from a perspective of suspicion.  My reading of this book, however, produced much fruit in the form of an enhanced appreciation for my own role, and especially that of my children themselves, in their own educations.  In his comments on the book, noted author and professor Ralph McInerny reminds us that \\"The Church has always insisted that the parents are the primary educators of their children.\\"  Far from being critical of formal education, Andres book is a positive and uplifting commentary on the concept of \\"unschooling\\" and shares ideas and suggestions that will be of value to any family, regardless of your educational preferences.	2005-08-30

Every once in a while, someone stops their routine and makes time to help someone in need.  These moments of service and caring, whether small or large, have the cumulative effect of making our world a better place for us all. <br /> <br />In her new book Every Monday Morning (Kregel Kidzone, July 2005, hardcover, 32 pages), author Linda Hutton tells the tale of one little corner of the world, one special man (and his loveable dog), and his efforts to help someone in need.   <br /> <br />Mr. Peters is a creature of habit.  Each day, he ventures through his neighborhood with his beloved dog Joey.  He's the type of neighbor who takes time to say hello and to introduce himself to strangers.  His daily walk takes him past the tree he's planted in honor of his late wife.  He always stops to lovingly pat the tree.  Mr. Peters doesn't seem to stray too much from his routine.  He even tells the same jokes and stories, but those in his neighborhood love and appreciate him and always laugh at his stories. <br /> <br />Upon learning of a group of people in great need, Mr. Peters becomes so engrossed in his loving plan to help and serve that his routine falls apart.  During the course of one non-routine week, he does something simple, yet extraordinary, to help a special group of needy children.   <br /> <br />Every Monday Morning features lovely watercolor artwork by Karen O. Murley and a story that will emphasize the importance, and rewards, of Christian service to every soul, whether child or adult, who's fortunate enough to discover this book.  It offers encouragement and an example - each of us can depart from the bustle of our own everyday commitments to make our own little corners of the world better for everyone.	2005-08-04

It may be difficult to know where to turn to determine the Church's teachings on medical ethics issues.  Along with reading Papal Encyclicals and staying abreast of statements by our Bishops and the Vatican, another helpful resource for Catholics is Good Care, Painful Choices: Medical Ethics for Ordinary People by Richard J. Devine, CM (Paulist Press, September 2004, paperback, 272 pages.) <br /> <br />Written in non-technical wording, Good Care, Painful Choices provides an accessible overview of many of the most common issues facing us today.  Father Devine, who recently celebrated the 50th anniversary of his ordination, has spent the bulk of his career in higher education and currently teaches Medical Ethics full time at St. John's University.  <br /> <br />I greatly enjoyed the clear, comprehensive and not overly technical presentation of the medical ethics topics presented in this book.

We all know about the perils of peer pressure and want to guard our children against them.  We also recognize that this can be one of parenting's most difficult challenges. <br /> <br />In their new book, Lenny Loses His Lunch (Kregel Kidzone, May 2005, hardcover, 32 pages) authors Dan Taylor and Damon J. Taylor give parents of children ages five and up a fun way to discuss the importance of taking a stand when faced with negative peer pressure.  This newest tale in the \\"God Can Use Me\\" series is a fun retelling of the biblical account of Daniel in the lion's den. <br /> <br />Lenny is a lion, but not a very brave one.  He tends to be a follower, choosing to participate in the activities the other lions pursue, even though they go against his own tastes and conscience.  All too often, he crumbles under the peer pressure of the other lions and makes the wrong choice. <br /> <br />Daniel, on the other hand, isn't afraid to take a stand.  His bravery and constant obedience to God land him in a tough spot.  He has to rely on his trust in God's plan to see him through a very dangerous test of his faith.  He stands firm in his faith, and teaches Lenny an important lesson - taking a stand for what you believe in, although scary sometimes, is always the right thing to do. <br /> <br />Lenny Loses His Lunch, although a fun fictional take on the Daniel stories, conveys the important biblical principles at hand.  A wonderful tool for opening early discussions on peer pressure issues, the book features cute sideline dialogue as a bonus to Damon Taylor's bold and eye-catching illustrations.  The book's emphasis on following God in our lives choices is an important message to share with children of any age. <br />	2005-07-15

O.K., I'll admit it...he had me with the title. Before I even cracked the cover of Matthew Lickona's new book Swimming With Scapulars: True Confessions Of A Young Catholic (Loyola Press, April 2005, hardcover, 278 pages), I found myself intrigued.  Gratefully, having now read and re-read the book in its entirety, I'll say I was not disappointed.  As a matter of fact, this book is among my favorites for the year - not because I agree 100% with everything Lickona writes in this memoir, but because of his stunningly gifted delivery and the honesty with which he shares his soul.      Swimming With Scapulars is the story of one young man's journey of faith.  The faith involved happens to be Catholicism, but the appeal of this book is not found in its theology, but rather in the glimpse it gives us into the development of spirituality in this young man.  Lest you think that Matthew is out to paint himself a saint, he's not - he shares his shortcomings, the temptations he faces, and his sins with a forthrightness that leaves you feeling like you really know him by the book's end.  Many of my favorite passages in the book deal with Matthew's relationships with family - his parents, his brother, and now his wife and children.      Treat yourself to the experience of reading Swimming With Scapulars - you will find yourself entertained, enlightened, and perhaps even inspired to examine the development of your own \\"soul story\\".	2005-06-01

Up until this moment, I hadn't really accepted the fact - although he'd reach the chronological age, he still seemed like my little boy.  Suddenly now, in the middle of his thirteenth year, I'm back to reading parenting manuals and seeking helpful advice in manner that I haven't done since my youngest was in the throes of the terrible twos. <br /> <br />Living with a teenager can be an adventure.

From my reading of Herrera's book, I've come to the perspective that this time as the mom of a teenager is as fleeting as were those toddler years; I should come at it with a sense of humor as large as the sense of love I feel for my son.   <br />	2005-05-26

In my mind, Mary looks a lot like a younger version of many of the important women in my own life.  For many, images of classic Madonnas by Rafael or sweet holy card remembrances are the face of Mary.  Despite her \\"look\\", worldwide devotion to Mary remains constant.   <br /> <br />As distant lands have come closer through the wonder of air travel and the Internet, new doors have been opened and many of us seek to learn more about the practice of Catholicism in other parts of the world.  Watching the sea of humanity present at the recent events at the Vatican, I marveled at the flags and faces representing so many fellow Christians from around the globe.  The universality of our faith struck me as I watched an Italian mother, a young Caucasian and an African gentleman all clutch their rosaries in the moments leading up to the announcement of Pope Benedict XVI's papacy. <br /> <br />Thanks to a wonderful new book by Ann Ball, we can learn more about stories, devotions and images of Mary from around the world.  In The Other Faces of Mary (Crossroads, December 2004, paperback, 160 pages), Ball introduces us to Mary through the eyes of our fellow Catholics in places such as Vietnam, Nigeria, India, Japan and more.  Ball and the many contributors to this book share with us a beautiful gift - the wonderful pictures that accompany the stories and reflections in this book left me wanting to travel to these places and see my own Faith through fresh eyes. <br />	2005-05-06

However, many new parents find themselves swamped once the child arrives, and parenting manuals frequently gather dust on the bookshelves as well intentioned moms and dads struggle just to keep everyone fed, clothed and relatively clean.  By the time our children reach school age, most of us are so busy driving them to their various activities that we take little time for parenting enrichment. <br /> <br />One new resource for parents, the latest book by Chick Moorman and Thomas Haller, The 10 Commitments: Parenting with Purpose (Personal Power Press, December 2004, hardcover, 157 pages), is well worth the time of any parent.  In this book, the authors challenge parents to adopt a new approach - \\"grace-full\\" parenting.  Using real-life examples and practical ideas, the book lays forth ten commitments every parent should make towards putting the role of parent and the family unit at the top of one's priority list.  Regardless of the age or number of children in your family, the book is a sound and inspiring primer and a reminder of the importance of truly engaging in our job and blessing as parents. <br /> <br />Read my interview with Thomas Haller at [...] <br />	2005-04-27

In these days before mobile DVD players and satellite radio, Daddy could spin a tale that would keep us swept up for hours and begging for more.  While I don't have my father's storytelling creativity, I love to share wonderful books with my own children.  <br /> <br />One of my new favorites is The Ballad of Blue Eagle (Synergy Books, October 2004, hardcover, 48 pages).  This first in a planned series is a father-son team project created by Steven E. Jones and his son, illustrator Steven E. Jones, Jr.  A lifelong Texan, Jones grew up listening to his father tell tales of Blue Eagle and his life safeguarding the various creatures of Peaceful Valley.  After his father's death, Steven wisely wrote these stories down for posterity.  The Ballad of Blue Eagle is a beautiful collaboration between Jones and his son Steven Jr., who has artfully illustrated this classic children's hardcover.  Steven Jones Jr. brings the characters of Peaceful Valley to life with his bold and sweeping watercolor scenes.  The themes present in The Ballad of Blue Eagle emphasize virtues you will want to share with your own children:  peaceful coexistence, community, friendship and not judging others.

Granted, life during my teenage years was much less complicated than what today's teens face - but some of the basic issues confronted by a young lady never change.  Susie Shellenberger has written a wonderful book that should be on the top of each caring mom's (or aunt's or grandmother's...) list of books to share with her daughter. <br /> <br />Written in an upbeat, conversational tone, How to Help Your Hurting Friend doesn't make any assumptions.  It rightly starts with a section on making friends and walks the young reader through the steps to being a great girlfriend.  Rightly, this section of the book culminates with Shellenberger's advice to \\"Be Jesus to those around you.\\"  This is great advice for any of us!  Shellenberger's wisdom seems to point towards relationships made better by fostering a giving and loving spirit, rather than what a person will take out of a relationship. <br /> <br />The meat of How to Help Your Hurting Friend is Section Two, which walks the reader through various scenarios that tragically, but realistically, come up frequently in today's society.  Eating disorders, depression, internet addictions, illness, self destructive behaviors and sexual abuse are each given detailed treatment by the author.  The list of \\"do\\" and \\"don't\\" suggestions at the end of each of the units provides teens with a good, proactive list of steps they can take to help a friend in need. <br /> <br />The third section of the book contains several letters to Susie, complete with her helpful responses covering a myriad of situations.  Also included are some helpful questions, prompts and inspiring articles. <br /> <br />Overall, I believe that How to Help Your Hurting Friend is a great resource for any teen or young adult, although the book will have strong appeal for young women.  I plan to read severalof the sections of the book with my thirteen year old son.  I have to say I gained quite a lot from reading the book myself.  If you learn nothing else from How to Help Your Hurting Friend, the one point of wisdom \\"Be Jesus to those around you\\" is worth the cover price.	2005-04-25

My family has been caught up in the home improvement craze for years, but our children have gotten in on the act too since becoming fans of one of those \\"home makeover\\" shows.  So when we took our teenager to pick out paint chips for his room last summer, we shouldn't have been surprised when he chose a \\"moon rock\\" green hue, embedded with grains of sand and flecks of glitter.  OK...we invited his involvement in the project, so we were going to have to live with the results!

In her new book When Lightning Strikes Twice (Twenty-Third Publications, January 2005, paperback 142 pages), she offers hope and encouragement to those facing the recurrence of difficult circumstances in their own lives. Following a victorious bout with cancer and after six years of good health, Alborghetti received the devastating news - lightening had struck her for a second time: the cancer was back. She found this second battle to be much more difficult than the first, and her experience led her to examine why that was the case. She found that others on similar journeys had the same experience.  <br /> <br />In the book, Alborghetti shares her own story, as well as those of others who found themselves faced with repeated tragedies. Marci's words of encouragement throughout the book spur the reader to proactive solutions and to a greater reliance on one's relationship with God in the face of life's challenges. Each chapter closes with a unique prayer, questions for reflection and concrete action steps. Though aimed at those who may be facing recurrent difficulties, the book has merit and value for anyone looking to transcend a time of pain, sadness or personal grief.  <br />	2005-04-11

As a resource for making contemplation of the Rosary a part of your life, authors Michael Dubruiel and Amy Welborn have compiled the book Praying the Rosary: With the Joyful, Luminous, Sorrowful, & Glorious Mysteries (Our Sunday Visitor, June 2003, hardcover, 64 pages).   <br /> <br />Though compact in size, this book can and will have a tremendous impact upon your life if you choose to read and implement its suggested format.  The book's introduction reiterates the Holy Father's call to this perfect form of Christian contemplation and points to the Blessed Virgin Mary as a role model for contemplating the true mystery of Jesus Christ, his life, death and resurrection.  Bearing both the Nihil Obstat and the Imprimatur, Praying the Rosary incorporates all four sets of mysteries, including the new Luminous mysteries. <br /> <br />Welborn and Dubruiel follow the format suggested by Pope John Paul II in Rosarium Virginis Mariae  including the announcement of the mystery, scriptural references, contemplative silence, the formal prayers of the Rosary (including a short prayer phrase following each Hail Mary related to the specific mystery), and a brief concluding prayer for each mystery.  Newcomers to Rosary devotion will find the compendium of prayers at the completion of the book a helpful resource. <br /> <br />Complimenting the suggested format, stunning artwork graces the pages for each of the mysteries.  Contemplation of these wonderful icons provided courtesy of St. Isaac of Syria Skete allows the user yet another point of interaction with the mysteries of the Rosary. <br /> <br />This book's compact size makes it the perfect tool for incorporating the Rosary into your daily devotional routine.  The hardcover format is durable and will stand up to daily use.  Thebook will easily slip into a purse, briefcase, day planner or coat pocket.  Praying the Rosary has taken up permanent residence in my \\"home away from home\\", my vehicle, where my boys and I daily contemplate the mysteries of the Rosary in our own effort to better know and love Jesus Christ.  We pray each day, joining our hearts and minds with countless millions around the globe, for peace in our own little corner of the world and beyond. <br />	2005-03-23

During this Year of the Eucharist, Catholics looking to more fully appreciate the sacrament while enriching their family or parish celebration of Holy Week should look to the wonderful new book Come to the Table:  A Catholic Passover Seder for Holy Week (Plowshares Publishing, January 2005, paperback, 96 pages).  Author Meredith Gould, Ph.D., writes from an educated perspective - describing herself as a \\"Jew by identity, a Christian by faith, and a Catholic in practice\\".  Gould's additional books include The Catholic Home: Celebrations and Traditions for Holidays, Feast Days and Everyday (Doubleday), which carries the imprimatur of the Catholic Church.  As an adult convert to Catholicism, she writes in a manner which will encourage Catholics to examine and embrace the richness of traditional Jewish rituals and symbolism surrounding the feast of Passover. <br /> <br />Having been raised in a Jewish home, Gould opens her book with reminiscences of family Passover celebrations.  With many Jewish friends of my own, I have discussed the wonderful family gatherings of this holiday and the memories created through the act of coming together in faith and celebration.  I am looking forward to sharing Meredith Gould's Catholic Passover Seder with my own family and friends this year as a part of our Holy Week celebration. <br /> <br />As background information, Gould supplies a history of the rituals and symbols of the traditional Passover feast.  An informative and touching section of the book entitled \\"Reconciliation and Teshuva\\" comments on the evolving relationship between Jews and Catholics, up to an including recent Papal acts and writings and current events such as reaction to Mel Gibson's film The Passion of the Christ.  Given this background, Gould recommends an emphasis on what we as Catholics share in common with our Jewish brethren.  The Catholic Passover Seder does not draw entirely on the traditional Jewish Seder, but rather provides an alternative inspired by and structured upon the original format but based in Christianity.   <br /> <br />The bulk of Come to the Table contains practical, step by step instructions for planning, preparing and conducting your own Catholic Passover Seder.  Gould's Seder may be used in either home, small group or parish settings.  A complete appendix section provides additional prescriptions for carrying out a successful Seder in your parish.   <br /> <br />I walked away from my experience of reading Come to the Table:  A Catholic Passover Seder for Holy Week both educated and inspired:  educated on this history, symbols and rituals which underpin this antecedent to our Holy Thursday Eucharistic traditions, and inspired to celebrate this new tradition in my own home and faith community. <br />	2005-03-13

In the first of their planned series, Gayle Somers and Sarah Christmyer offer a comprehensive look at the first eleven chapters of the book of Genesis from both an intellectual and a relational perspective.  These opening pages of the Bible are examined from a uniquely Catholic frame of reference, in light of Catholic tradition and Church teachings.  Intended for either group or individual study,   Genesis Part I: God and His Creation (Emmaus Road Publishing, November 2004, paperback, 140 pages) features a ten lesson study.  A complete appendix on the reading of the first chapter of Genesis, and lesson summaries and guides are also included.  <br /> <br />A few years ago, as the sole Catholic in an interfaith Bible study group, I would have welcomed this resource for its wonderful emphasis on Catholic fundamentals, the Catechism, the sacraments and overall Church teaching.  Whether you're looking to embark on a new dedication to the discipline of scripture study, or to enhance your current knowledge of the book of Genesis, the Hearts Aflame series is to be commended.	2005-03-09

Antoinette Bosco's wonderful book for children examines the passion of Jesus Christ from the perspective of the plants and animals who fill his favorite garden.  The opening pages of the book enable this love story to play out, introducing us to the dogwoods, the robin, the heart-shaped flowers, and of course their special friend Jesus.   <br /> <br />As the story plays out, we follow the Passion story from the moment of the agony in the Garden, through the Crucifixion, and ultimately Jesus' Resurrection.  Most children's books that I've seen on this topic can be rather frightening, but Bosco and illustrator Patricia Mattozzi have managed to relay the story of Jesus' death in a manner which is gentle and not frightening.  Mattozzi's illustrations are wonderful, luminescent depictions that warm the beautiful tale Bosco has crafted. <br /> <br />The book's subtitle rightly calls this \\"An Easter Legend\\", for there are indeed some imaginary aspects to the story, but its main themes of Jesus Christ's transcendent love for each of us shines through.  Don't save this one for Easter - it's a story to be loved all year through! <br />	2005-03-02

Books	5	0	0	N	N	Prayer Takes Many Forms	In her charming new book How Did Bible Heroes Pray (Kregel Kidzone, February 2005, hardcover, 24 pages) author Mona Hodgson helps children explore the concept of prayer and how to integrate it into their own daily lives.  Hodgson points to the heroes children may be familiar with in the Bible and shares how each of these special people turned to God in prayer.  For each example given, the author cites the relevant scripture passage for further research and edification.  As Daniel turned to God on his knees, children are encouraged to pray to God using this posture.  As Samuel lay in bed listening to and conversing with God, children are reminded that they too can take quiet time in bed to pray. <br /> <br />Next Hodgson turns to detailing situations when children might feel led to pray.  Jonah's fear, Job's sadness and Jesus' need for \\"alone time\\" with his father are all situations to which today's child can relate.  Reminding ourselves and our children that facing moments of uncertainty or disappointment with prayer is a valuable lesson we can offer our families and students.  <br /> <br />This book is geared at children ages five and up, as each page features only a few lines of text.  A noteworthy contribution to How Did Bible Heroes Pray is the artwork of illustrator Hollie Gillett, whose delightful illustrations feature a broad cross section of ages and races on a pallet of beautiful backgrounds. <br />	2005-02-11

In the new book Duncan Carries a King (Kregel Kidzone, January 2005, hardcover, 32 pages) authors Dan Taylor and Damon J. Taylor introduce the character Duncan the Donkey.  Duncan feels lost and useless, unable to ascertain his purpose in life.  He looks around him and sees the friends he grew up with pursuing meaningful jobs that make a difference.  He has a strong desire for God to use him in some way, but he sadly is unable to determine a vocation. <br /> <br />Blending fiction with Biblical accounts, the authors introduce the story of Jesus sending his disciples to find a young donkey that he will ride into Jerusalem, fulfilling a prophecy from Zechariah.  Duncan the donkey learns that God does indeed have a purpose for his life - God has specifically chosen him to carry his son Jesus into Jerusalem.  Duncan's triumphant entry into the holy city leaves him wondering what plan God has in store for him next. <br /> <br />With bold illustrations and a plot that aligns closely with the New Testament account of Jesus' entry into Jerusalem, Duncan Carries a King is the perfect tool for parents looking to teach children the message that God has given each of us unique and precious talents.  Also included in the book is a special section for parents including objectives and discussion questions for parents or teachers.  Children will love Duncan Carries a King for its creativity and the loveable Duncan.  Parents will appreciate the book for its emphasis on prayer, patience, perseverance and a serving heart. <br />	2005-02-04

The opening pages of the story find a father sharing the Bible with his son and in turn taking time to read it with him.  From here, the true action of the book begins as this gift leads to all kinds of imaginative thoughts.  As the boy learns stories from the Bible, he begins to act out the accounts in his own little world.   <br /> <br />Sprinkled throughout the book are references to classic Old Testament accounts.  Readers will love how the boy absorbs and then finds his own take on the stories of Noah, Joseph, Moses and others.  Holmes illustrations lend life to the story - I was particularly drawn to the variety of facial expressions in the book.   <br /> <br />The book's end finds the boy sharing the gift he's received and loved so much with a friend.  This gentle approach to witnessing to our faith will make sense to kids - who wouldn't want to share a gift that brings so much wisdom, enlightenment and fun?  If You Give a Boy a Bible is aimed at children ages four through eight years of age, but I'm willing to predict that most grown ups will learn a thing or two from this enjoyable book. <br />	2005-02-04

In the new book Saint Brendan and the Voyage Before Columbus (Paulist Press, December 2004, paperback, 32 pages) author Dr. Mike McGrew and illustrator Marnie Saenz Litz share the story of St. Brendan and his legendary voyage to North America.<br /><br />Through lyrical prose and vivid illustrations, this book recounts the life history of Saint Brendan, the Irish monk who spread the message of Jesus Christ in his own land of Ireland and, legend states, beyond to the land of Tir-na-n-Og and to its native \\"painted saints\\", a thousand years before Columbus set sail for North America.  Whether fact or fiction, Brendan's voyage has sparked the enthusiasm and adventurous spirit of many, including sailors who count him as their patron saint.<br /><br />The great value in providing children with the images of concrete role models is that it helps them see that they too can capture their dreams.  McGrew shares Saint Brendan's story with zeal and energy, stressing the saint's reliance on God's protection and his appreciation for God's hand in the nature surrounding him and in his brother monks.  Children who might not sit still for a dry recitation of the facts of a saint's life will be drawn in and inspired by this book and its message to trust in God and pursue your dreams.  Aimed at children ages four through eight, the book will also be enjoyed by older adventurers and those interested in the lives of the saints.	2005-02-04

Time spent helping Daddy at home relates to Jesus' childhood years working with Joseph in the carpenter's shop.  A family picnic helps to recall the occasion of the miracle of the loaves and fishes.  Climbing a tree reminds the child of the story of the diminutive Zacchaeus, who was so anxious to have a good view of Jesus that he climbed to the top of a nearby sycamore. <br /> <br />As parents, one of the greatest gifts we can bestow upon our children is the knowledge that whatever happens in life, we can always call upon our friendship with Jesus Christ.  He is there for us in times of trial, as well as moments of triumph.  Jesus I Feel Close to You underscores this perpetual presence and reminds the reader to call upon and nurture this special friendship.  Its simple message of intimacy and trust are something you will want to share with your child time and again.  A comprehensive list of Bible references at the end of the book provides a great resource for parents who want to go to the \\"source\\" for sharing these great stories with their families.   <br />	2005-02-04

Serving as writer for countless Catholic periodicals has given this convert to the faith an excellent vantage point from which to seek out instances of devotion in today's younger generation.  This wonderful book provides an up close look at how younger Catholics are responding the Holy Father, John Paul II's call to be \\"the Hope of the Church\\".   <br /> <br />Drake shares numerous instances of young men and women leading lives of profound service and dedication to the Church.  An increase in vocations, new and creative means of evangelization, and use of the Internet to deepen and spread the faith are just a few of the examples Drake cites.   <br /> <br />Readers will be encouraged by these first person accounts and inspired by the role models they meet in the pages of the book.  Perhaps most importantly, they will likely be prompted by Drake's positive, infectious enthusiasm and by promptings of the Holy Spirit to join these young, future leaders in embracing and truly living the teachings of Jesus Christ.	2005-01-20

Anderson grabbed me from page one.  This is probably due to the fact that Nancy takes time to share her own experience and marriage prior to jumping into suggestions for how you can improve yours.   <br /> <br />In the first section of the book, we learn why Nancy calls herself a \\"cheater\\" on the first page and we experience the strains and near break up of her own marriage.  Thanks to the power of prayer, true forgiveness and the guidance of loving parents, Nancy and Ron were able to work through the challenges they faced and have now gone on to be happily married for 26 years.   <br /> <br />Given this backdrop, the second section of the book is filled with helpful principles that will enable couples to avoid the many extramarital temptations that may crop up in even the strongest of Christian marriages.  Nancy shares her ideas and widsom in a fun, very readable fashion.   <br /> <br />The \\"things to do\\" and \\"things to think about\\" sections at the completion of each chapter help to pull together the concepts presented and to apply them to one's own relationship.  This is a great resource for couples in all stages of marriage and equally valuable to couples either happily married or facing challenges.

Author, academician and geographer Dorothy Drummond has accomplished this undertaking, and succeeded in pulling it all together into a book that is at once informative, unbiased and filled with hope.  Holy Land, Whose Land?

Perhaps more remarkable, however, is her ability to draw the reader into a topic that many choose to disregard as beyond understanding.

I find Catholicism for Dummies (Wiley, June 2003, paperback, 384 pages) an excellent resource for both my own research and for teaching the faith in a straightforward yet comprehensive manner.  Authors Rev. John Trigilio Jr. and Rev. Kenneth Brighenti have compiled a wide-ranging resource which will be of help for anyone looking to increase their knowledge of and devotion to their own practice of Catholicism.    Written in a concise, organized fashion, the Catholicism for Dummies offers practical information on all of the most basic elements of Catholicism, including - but not limited to - the Four Marks of the Church (One, Holy, Catholic, Apostolic), the structure of the Church, basic beliefs, worship types, the Sacraments, the Mass, and much more.  Timely (and at times controversial) issues of concern to most Catholics are discussed.      I found especially enjoyable the \\"Part of Tens\\" which relates the stories of remarkable Catholic role models and landmarks.  The two appendices, one detailing the popes and a second outlining a brief history of the Church, are helpful additions.

They may not know the meaning or origin of the words they pray, but the prayer itself is a part of their core, their identity, their soul.  In her latest book The Words We Pray (Loyola Press, October 2004, paperback, 210 pages), Amy Welborn gives her readers a gift - the gift of prayer, of knowing not only the words to our favorite prayers, but the stories behind them and the occasions in life when turning to them can provide solace and joy. <br /> <br />I have long admired Welborn's ability to write.  Picking up one of her books, or treating yourself to an article she's written is like a combination of having lunch with a friend and a tutoring session with a knowledgeable mentor.  The Words We Pray continues this tradition for me, as Amy Welborn captures so effectively the essence and origin of traditional Catholic prayers.  The book opens with Welborn's heartfelt description of her own \\"journey\\" towards an eventual embracing of prayers such as the Salve Regina.   <br /> <br />The true stars of The Words We Pray are the prayers themselves.  Welborn has included eighteen of the most popular and powerful Catholic prayers, and has richly described their histories and traditions.  When we as Catholics turn to God in communication using these wonderful gems of our Faith, we take our place in the Communion of Saints who have over countless years turned to these prayers to seek intercession and aid.  Welborn's book concludes with an interesting discussion of \\"where our prayers go\\" and the value of praying vocally, using traditional prayers.  The Words We Pray serves not only as a valuable reference, but also as an invitation to a deeper and richer prayer life.  <br />	2004-10-27

Cirner acknowledges the wisdom of the spiritual masters who have lent classic wisdom to the topic of living a holy life, but offers this book for those looking to \\"bridge\\" their own spiritual journeys to such classical writers as St. John of the Cross or Teresa of Avila.   <br /> <br />Cirner's six keys, prayer, Scripture and spiritual reading, the sacraments, community, virtue and forgiveness, are each laid out in a chapter concluding with reflection questions and an inspirational prayer.  The book could be used as a small prayer group resource, or would be excellent for individual contemplation and reflection.  Additional literary references are recommended for each of the Keys, offering the reader a treasure trove of resources for the challenge of growing a deeper spiritual life. <br />	2004-10-11

Most days I'm just busy ensuring that four sets of teeth get brushed after every meal - the thought of being loving, joyful, peaceful, patient, kind, good, faithful, gentle and exercising self control can be daunting.  Thank goodness for encouraging authors like Elisa Morgan, who not only inspire the heart, but also offer the tools to keep me aiming at and running towards my spiritual goals. <br /> <br />NAKED FRUIT gives moms the tools they need to open their hearts and souls to accepting the Spirit's gift, and equips them to grow in their relationship with God and with those whose lives they touch.  Author and MOPS International President Elisa Morgan's concept that the \\"Naked Fruit\\" of a relationship with God is simply becoming (as best we can) like Jesus is as refreshingly satisfying as the first bite into a luscious orange on a hot summer afternoon! <br /> <br />The book's brief, yet insightful chapters end in thought provoking (but manageable) \\"Fruit for Thought\\" exercised designed to help busy mothers see a clear path to growing more fruitful in their own circles of relation.  Although the book is aimed at mothers, any Christian looking to honestly make the world a better place and wanting to grow in love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self control will doubtless benefit from the experience of reading, savoring and digesting NAKED FRUIT. <br />	2004-08-25

Very young children will quickly learn the answers and make the story their own.<BR>The artwork in the book is bright and colorful and will attract little readers with its use of a fun and interesting array of animal friends.<BR>It's good that this is a durable board book, because you're likely to read it time and again throughout the year with your favorite readers.	2002-10-25

As a fiction lover and fan of inspirational books such as the Mitford series, I was overjoyed when I heard about the publication of A Miracle for St. Cecilia's.  Why? Because in today's world, there is always a need for books emphasizing the theme of Hope - hope in times of despair when it seems that the odds are stacked so staggeringly against us.  Katherine Valentine manages to spread the good news that there is good cause to believe in Hope, and she manages to tell a great story while sharing this good news.<BR>Set in the charming but declining mill town of Dorsetville, A Miracle for St. Cecilia's unites a cast of characters who, while engaged in their own personal struggles, come together to fight for a cause close to their hearts.  Their beloved Catholic church, the focal point of their spiritual lives and social structure, and a source of financial and emotional support for their decaying community, is about to close.  The book brings together an unlikely band of heroes:  a dad with a deadly disease, a troubled young computer genious, three aging retirees (one of whom is Jewish, but a good friend to the church), a retired hunting dog, an elderly Irish priest, and the Pastor of St. Cecilia's who has great intentions but just can't seem to pull his parish out of the red ink.<BR>The story moves along nicely and pulls the reader in quickly. I fell in love with the people of Dorsetville and found myself thinking about the many communities across our country who find themselvs facing these same troubling circumstances in their own places of worship.<BR>As a Catholic, I appreciated this book for its attention to doctrinal and liturgical detail.  I feel, however, that its message has broader appeal and that it will touch the hearts and souls of many.  Katherine Valentine has created a wonderful book here and I look forward to reading the next in what I hope will be a series of books related to these charming characters.  Treat yourself to this book, and buy it for a special friend!	2002-10-14

I am constantly on the look out for quality books for children dealing with faith related topics and was thrilled to find Milo With A Halo!  Umina's Milo is an irresistable character who is sure to be a hit with readers young and old.  The book's major theme is that God is with us always and is truly our very best friend and companion.  This is a message that we all need in our lives, whether we're 3 or 93, and parents will find great joy in sharing it with the precious children in their lives.<br />The books use of rhyme and repetition will appeal to even the youngest of readers.  Each bold, bright illustration captures the spirit of Milo and his companions as he searches for a \\"best friend\\".  This would be a great book for any young child - also a great gift for Baptism or First Communion celebrations!  I will be waiting for more adventures with Milo and looking forward to sharing them with my family!  Congratulations to Lisa Umina, Andrea Karcic and Halo Publishing for creating an imporant resource for families looking to teach and learn about the love of God.	2002-07-28

My fellow travellers must have wondered what was going on with me...alternating between furious highlighting and underlining, giggles, sobs of emotion and lots of head nodding and smiles.  Beth Corcoran's book touched my soul in a way few others have - it spurred me to immediate action.  The book is organized into short chapters with &quot;personal touch&quot; life application opportunities and brief devotional offerings at the conclusion of each chapter.  Beth's writing style is consice, witty and touching.  By the end of the first few chapters, you feel as though you know this woman like a sister or a dear friend and you want to reach out and share your heart with her.  The &quot;personal touch&quot; issues will provoke meaningful life change in women of any age, regardless of whether or not you have young children.  Beth's goal is to help us grow closer to God and to grow as women, individuals and mothers.  The book is a quick and enjoyable read, but you will find yourself coming back to sections and rereading again and again.  I would highly recommend this book!	2001-02-22
