Why has our nation's healthcare system descended into a chaotic battle between the forces of personal and corporate gain, and that of compassion? Is our medical system deteriorating? How can ethics and morality be restored?    Prescription For Greed answers these questions, as it enlightens its readers about the most serious problems our country must face. Its quality of life, even survival, depend on the issues the authors explore.    The book is as excursion into the problems of modern medicine, set within the context of a mainstream novel; an instrument of education, at the same time it entertains.    Co-author J. Willis Hurst is a former chariman of the Emory School of Medicine and has been involved in healthcare and teaching for over thirty years. The insight the novel provides is fueled by his passion for his field, as its characters reveal the profession's deepest secrets. His son, co-author Phillip W. Hurst, is an international business consultant. Specializing in behavioral systems analysis, he has a PhD in Psychology, which gives him extraordinary perception as a writer.    This knowledgeable team provides a crucial resource for healthcare consumers. You can learn as much as you might in a college course, as you experience a compelling and interesting story. Because the authors live in Atlanta, where the story is set, they are able to add a distinctive regional flavor.    The plot surrounds the fictional Dr. Connelly. A leader in medicine and cardiology, he has grounded his proteges in respect and honor for their vocation. When one's situation causes him to be vulnerable to financial temptation, all are affected. They undergo trials and tests of their values, as well as their friendship. Their patients' and their own lives depend on the outcome. The choices they make will altar them forever. Threaded with political intrigue, as well as romance, Prescription For Greed is well worth reading.	2001-05-28

Wildflowers of Georgia is a feast for the intellect and the eyes. The book contains information relating to Georgia's wildflowers and their native habitats, as well as suggestions for hiking trails and other sites where one can view them.    The common and scientific names of the plants, as well as location and season pictured, are meticulously documented. However, It's the high impact vivid photography that makes this work delightful.    The authors spent eight years traveling the state searching out and capturing these flowers on film. They are as lavishly showcased as if in a floral show. For many of them the display may be a rarity. Human activity and development have placed their survival in danger.    The eighty-six photographs presented in the book are divided into four physiographic regions. The authors introduce each region with explanations and anecdotal experiences. Their writing style gives the reader a feeling of comfortable companionship. One can sense community within these pages as we are invited to share in the comaraderie of viewing and enjoying Georgia's most colorful and dramatic resource.	2001-01-03

Christopher Camuto writes a powerful narrative describing his exploration of the Cherokee homeland in the appalachians.    He seeks communion, a connection he can sense in what is left of the natural landscape and wildness around him. It is as elusive as the dying Cherokee myths, as tangible as the arrowheads and village sites he finds.    Camuto refers to the Appalacians as the Cherokee Mountains, their former nomenclature, because it is to the Cherokees they really belong. The rape and exploitation of their land parallels the rape and exploitation of their culture.    Camuto's search for a wildness, that now remains only in remnants, is set in counterpoint to the reintroduction of the red wolf into the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The most important clan animal of the Cherokee, it is symbolic of the differences between the Cherokee and the early Europeans. One revered its wildness and sought to preserve it. The other despised and killed it. One honored the wolf's home, seeking harmony with the land and its spirits. The other saw something untamed that must be destroyed.    The author's journey begins as the wolves are being set free. Like many of the members of this first Canus Rufus release who step beyond their shrinking boundaries, Camuto confronts the vestiges of civilization at almost every turn.    Set against continual references to Native-American mythology, and the history of the area, Camuto's book allows the reader to share his insight into the Cherokee view of the world. Unlike many who write about early culture, he does not attempt to steal  it as his own. His statement that he is not Cherokee and thus can never totally understand, adds credibility to the objectiveness of his observations. It also demonstrates humbleness of endeavor, a bow of respect to the Cherokee nation.    The book is firmly rooted in place as it combines the ethereal with the tangible landscape. Those who cherish wildness and honor those first here, will also treasure this book. In many ways , it is a sad obituary, lamenting that which was, as it examines what is left. The reintroduction of the red wolf represents one small, but hopeful, step in the restoration of that which is lost.	2001-01-01

These are just a few of the absurd images shared in this charming book.  In A Buzzard Is My best Friend, Margaret Anne Barnes describes her family's experience on a 112 acre farm. Searching for solace beyond the suburbs, they sought the peace of a country home. Little did they know what lay ahead.  As they moved from crisis to crisis, family members learned as much about themselves as they did about farming. They also learned about the animals and birds around them.  An ice-water rescue by ducks, and peacocks in a paddock are just a few of the situations they encountered.  Written in an engaging companionable style, this memoir explores the triumphs and tragedies of rural living. A celebration of bonding and values, it is peopled with an assortment of personalities, including four-legged creatures. Its insights are lessons for all generations.  Originally published in 1981, the work has been reprinted by the Mercer University Press, a testimonial to its timeless appeal.  (This book was a joy to read, not only because of its interesting story, but because of the fantastically good writing.

According to Bowerman, one of the first things you should do is make the commitment. Once that is done, you'll be surprised at what comes your way.     A main focus should be the corporate world.
