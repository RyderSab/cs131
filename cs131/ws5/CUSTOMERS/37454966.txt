As his past becomes clearer to him, he sets out with knights on the 5th Crusade as a squire - but largely in hopes of finding his lost father. <br /> <br />Amidst various adventures and misfortunes, John's path crosses with none other than St. Francis of Assisi and intertwined with a true piece of history involving a visit to the fierce ruler of the Saracens. <br /> <br />An interesting and engaging story for middle-school children - especially 5th to 8th grade. It offers a surprisingly balanced view of the Crusades as well as beautiful themes of faithfulness and forgiveness.	2005-05-22

It is comprised of 201 colorful flashcards with very simple artwork on one side  and the word (represented by the picture) in English and six other languages on the other. The language covered are Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Russian and Latin. The audio CD runs through all the cards, carefully pronounced, one language at a time. (e.g. one section runs through all the cards in Japanese, a different section runs through all the cards in Latin). This simple and reasonably priced package is thoughtfully put-together and has many uses. <br /> <br />Supplement to Individual Foreign Language Program - the languages chosen are those that Power Glide sells entire course for. Thus, these cards can be used with the appropriate segment of the CD to practice vocabulary for one specific language already being studied. <br /> <br />For those planning on having their children study a specific foreign language in the future, this would be very simple program to purchase when they are quite young. The preschool and early grade school years are an excellent time to pick up vocabulary. <br /> <br />Finally, having all six languages together makes for an intesting comparison between the languages - on a very simple level. For my children, who are beginning to study Latin in 3rd grade, this is a great place to realize that there are many words in many languages related to Latin. <br /> <br />The cards are organized into categories such as: numbers, months, colors, clothing and family members. <br /> <br />I would have given the product five stars if only the pictures were more beautiful.	2005-04-27

(This feature is nice both because it makes it easier for beginning students to choose from a limited vocabulary and because it eliminates confusion about which ending should be used to fit precisely in the crossword.) <br /> <br />This is a fun and easy way to practice vocabulary and have a little variety in your Latin studies.	2004-08-09

The story is quite engaging (my 11 year old daughter LOVED it!) and is conceptually interesting as well. Each visit to the past brings the characters farther back in time and presents a piece of the puzzle they're putting together in their heads - a bit of the sense of perspective that history gives us, the struggles that are dealt with in every age, and the importance of faith and perserverance. <br /> <br />I also enjoyed the little details present in the story - like how the children are called by their own names by \\"relatives\\" in each era, but their names and the names around them are believably related to the time-period. Costumes and manner of speech are attended to quite nicely as well. The story is set in the 1950s and the time travel sequences eventually take the characters all the way back to Roman Britain.	2004-08-09

The reader is introduced to the names of thirteen different animals, numbers from 1-12 and 100 (both in Roman numerals and written out in Latin). This is all done in an early-reader type format with simple, realistic line drawings and large, easy-to-read words.  <br />  <br /> This would be a great book for young children (approximately 4-8 years old) whose older siblings are studying Latin - particularly in a homeschool setting where they are exposed to some of the lessons and may overhear (and be curious about) some of the words. <br />  <br /> The back of the book includes complete translations of the Latin text (although these are fairly simple to surmise from the pictures), a pronunciation guide, glossary and other notes. <br />  <br />	2004-07-21

The story is told through the eyes of four-year-old Bonnie. Her understanding father helps her through frustrations in trying to keep up with her older siblings. The simple stories contain truths that will be appreciated by very young children. In one example, the father announces that the child who shows wisdom and bravery will be awarded a special arrowhead that he found. Each child shares stories of acts of courage until one really stands out. My four and six year old girls really enjoyed this as a read-aloud and my eight devoured it eagerly on his own (and he can be hard to find books for at this stage).<br />We're looking forward to reading the other three titles in the series - Schoolhouse in the Woods, Up and Down the River and Schoolhouse in the Parlor - due to be republished soon.	2004-07-12

These true stories were told within the family by Caddie herself until her own granddaughter compiled them into a best-selling book around 1930. Don't let the date set you off - this is a real page turner with something in it for everyone. It has stood the test of time remarkably well.<br />Caddie and her family grew up in Boston, but made the drastic change to rural life a few years before the story begins. While Caddie's mother encourages a high level of civility in the rough wilds of western Wisconsin, her father is permitted to allow Caddie to grow up running around with her brothers because of concerns of a sister who died of consumption. Caddie is quite the tom boy in her pre-teen years, but what a delight to see her world through these eyes... adventures with curious Indians, a mischievous uncle, loyal siblings, school bullies and a simpler life. Especially touching is Caddie's relationship with her understanding father, whose unusual past is revealed in a surprising fashion to the children.<br />Great for children and adults (like me) who missed it the first time around! By the way, you can visit Caddie Woodlawn's house when you're in the vicinity of Menomonie, Wisconsin. There's not a lot to see, buy our family really enjoyed the experience.	2004-06-26

(a good children's book about this incident in particular is \\"Number the Stars\\" by Lois Lowry)<br />Andre and Magda Trocme and the city of Le Chambon France who provided a place of refuge for many Jews.<br />Padre Niccacci of Assisi, Italy, who rescued many Jews, even hiding them in the cloistered convents (this is also the subject of a movie called \\"The Assisi Underground\\").<br />Each story is approximately 20 pages in length, followed by a collection of six shorter stories (a page or two each).<br />The stories are written in a way to be inspiring to children without getting too gruesome or overwhelming in \\"mature\\" details. Although this isn't a great work of literature, the heroism of the stories come through to help children begin to grasp the idea of evil in the world while putting their finger on excellent examples of those who did something about it. In this way, the book is neither depressing nor pessimistic, but instead allows the noble actions of great people to live on in the understanding of young people today.	2004-06-26

A diligent student will take from it, not only a useful grasp of vocabulary (which can be very helpful on the SAT as well as for those going into scientific or medical fields), but a better understanding of the English language, the experience of a mind-broadening exercise and the development of a more precise and logical way of thinking about language.<br />The text is designed for high school (and three more volumes follow this first year text), but could be used as early as 6th or 7th grade if taken at a slower pace and with some supplementation. Its companion Grammar volume is an essential component.<br />Henle uses a relatively brief vocabulary (focused primarily on Caesar's Gallic wars) in order to hone in on the grammar concepts. By the end of this book, a student should have a solid foundation and be ready to start translating some basic Ancient texts. This text does assume a certain grammar foundation prior to tackling Latin. Some of this can be reviewed while studying the Latin. A helpful prior grammar understanding would include: basic diagramming and an understanding of the following terms: subject, verb, direct object, indirect object, pronoun, adjective, adverb, conjunction, preposition, possessive adjective, predicatve nominative, etc.<br />The downside of the limited vocabulary is that the rather un-varying vocabulary can make the book somewhat tedious. In our homeschool co-op, where I've been teaching Henle to a group of teens, it has worked quite well to spread this text out over two years, but supplement with other material. We have added some fun vocabulary to our working base from the \\"Latin is Fun\\" text by John Traupman (which we had studied before Henle). Each student also has a Latin dictionary.<br />I frequently assign the students to write additional sentences (in English or Latin) for their fellow students to translate. These are particularly enjoyable when the students are encouraged to write funny sentences. We play some games on occasion - Latin Bees, Latin \\"Pictionary\\", Latin Rummy (write Latin words on playing cards and try to make grammatically correct, if silly, senntences), etc.<br />We have also recently started reading from \\"Lingua Latina\\" by Hans Oerberg in addition to Henle. This has worked out well as pronunciation practice as well as helping the students think through some of the Latin without translating.<br />Another fun assignment is a \\"Latin Treasure Hunt\\". I gave the students a list of common Latin words, phrases and abbreviations that are used in the U.S. today - such as \\"emeritus\\" and \\"bona fide\\" (you can find a very extensive list of such words in \\"Amo, Amas, Amat and More\\" by Eugene Erlich). The students translate the list and look for examples in text, print, conversation, on the Internet, etc. and see who can come up with the most. This has really opened my students eyes up to noticing relations between the Latin language and \\"real life.\\"<br />Finally, a good exercise for the mind that requires some of the same multi-level thinking skills as Latin is to play chess!	2004-06-26

Further Adventures of Caddie Woodlawn	Caddie Woodlawn's Family (originally titled \\"Magical Melons\\") was written several years after the award-winning best-selling original \\"Caddie Woodlawn\\". This is a more loosely connected selection of stories about Caddie and her family which covers a wider span than the original book and even overlaps a bit. Although it sounds a little funny, it works (and even makes sense) since these are true stories written down by Caddie's granddaughter.<br />The stories are simple, but delightful. Not only do they give readers a glimpse into a different era (and in a way that isn't overly sanitized or modernized), but the stories are delightful in and of themselves. They are so real in illustrating the way children are and the way life is. And the icing on the cake is that they really happened.<br />If you liked Caddie Woodlawn even a little, you certainly won't want to miss these gems.	2004-06-26

I think the stories are rather groundbreaking for their day in that they're sort of anti-Leave it to Beaver. Rather than a \\"perfect\\" and orderly household that's just-so middle class we have a hectic family of four teen and young-adult children and a widowed father who is frequently out of town. While there father is loving and they have a substantial \\"support system\\" in each other and in friends and neighbors, many of the conflicts and plot-lines center around very real confusions, temptations and philosophies that teens struggle with. It's nice to see ideas like the value of earning your own money, the dangers of \\"going steady\\" too soon, the difficulties of early marriage, the beauty of a simple wedding and the importance of love and understanding in dealing with \\"difficult children\\" incorporated into engaging stories. Teens will benefit from grappling with these ideas in a story before they face them in real life.<br />The stories are very girlish - there's a lot about dating and clothes.

The perky and social Rose adjusts well to the big-city Catholic high school - making lots of friends and even being invited to the Senior Prom by the most popular boy in school. Blanche, on the other hand, more nervous and shy by nature, is incessantly teased by her schoolmates and struggles with her own internal fears about life. <br />Despite Blanche's objections, Rose and their mother (who was recently widowed) befriend a scruffy (dread-locked) transient, \\"Bear\\", who spent time in Juvenile Hall for drug possession. <br />A page-turning adventure and mystery unfold in which appearances are not always what they seem and the two sisters grow in faith, friendship and determination. <br />In the background of the story whirl a myriad of ideas about life, love, courage, fear, reality, death and much more that teenagers (and adults too) struggle with. But in the end the reader walks away with a sense of hope and that, yes, life is difficult and many bad things can happen, but even so God is in charge and the truth will come out in the end if we don't give up.<br />If the average person on the street today were asked how they would define \\"a fairy tale\\", I think they would describe a story in which \\"perfect\\" people had certain adventures, but in the end lived happily ever after. Unfortunately our modern ideas of fairy tales come largely from animated Disney movies of the past 50 years.<br />\\"The Shadow of the Bear\\" is based on the classic fairy tale \\"Snow White and Rose Red\\". Yet it is nothing like our common idea of a fairy tale because our modern definition is flawed. Reading this book, might, in fact, enhance your idea of what a fairy tale is.	2003-03-18
