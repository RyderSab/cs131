The meritocratic world has three classes of people: Zek-Tiv's (executives) who run things and settle scores in blood, Zone-Dwellers who resemble 1984's proles and also settle scores in blood, and the rest of the world, which is basically a huge sharecropper society. <br /> <br />The \\"hero\\" of the story has qualms about his day job, which mostly involves running bloody civil wars for profit, and almost saves his soul by defecting to the UN, but in the end the golden handcuffs work as well as ever.  I liked that touch. <br /> <br />All this has come about because of globalization which, among other things, was put in place to keep the western world permanently up, and everyone else permanently down. <br /> <br />In this book the violence is ultra, the sex is pornographic, the background is an anti-market rant.  Oh, and there's a cute reference to his other books. <br /> <br />I finished the book, but didn't particularly like it.  It's simply too much of a rant.	2005-03-15

Maybe it's about a China that's now gone, but it's a great read nonetheless. <br /> <br />For me, well, I once worked with a bunch of Chinese guys, in the US and in Japan.  Personally, I think Theroux's observations of ordinary Chinese people are right on the mark.  What struck me most was the Chinese laugh.  It's true what he says, that the laugh usually means anything but mirth.  Sometimes it's to cover embarrassment, sometimes to cover pain, but rarely is it the loud laugh that speaks the vacant mind. <br /> <br />Talking to buddies of mine who've traveled in China, mostly by train, and in the last couple of years, I'm struck that not all that much has changed.  Maybe for the top 0.25%, but that's about it. <br /> <br />Anyway, a good read.	2005-01-12

From the book I got that:<br />- Islamic culture reached its peak of power around 1453.  Since then it's been on a downward slide.<br />- The Turks, being the major Islamic power, were the ones to take the brunt of the impact with the West.<br />- The Turks have asked themselves what they can do to compete with the West.<br />- The Turks want at least to \\"Modernize\\", if not to \\"Westernize\\", and have taken steps in that direction.<br />- Part of this modernization is a separation of temporal and spiritual authority.<br />- The rest of Islam has missed out.  Rather, the rest of Islam wants Western greatness, but without what makes the West great.  It wants the attributes without the attitude.<br />The end result is that you've got about 700 million people seething with jealous rage, wanting to bring the infidel low.<br />This rage, originally directed at Great Britain and France, is now directed at the United States.  This is a huge problem for the U.S., as recent events have shown.<br />The solution?  Well, how do you change the mentality of 700 million people?<br />Iran and Turkey emerge in the book as the major influencers of the Islamic world.  Turkey is pretty pretty secular, and has applied for membership in the EU.<br />Iran has been a major exporter of Islamic terror, but it looks like the Islamic revolution in Iran is on the skids and is only kept in place by armed, imported thugs.<br />If Iran should go secular, like Turkey, the Islamic world might finally begin to modernize.<br />I'm not holding my breath, however.	2002-08-26

The Irish RC church did its level best to become a dictatorship.  And came close to achieving that goal for some time.

It goes on to detail the church's unique contribution to Irish alcoholism.  <br />From there we get to the persent day, when people are objecting to child abuse by priests and nuns and the church is responding by saying that if people won't play the church's way, then the church is going to take its football and go home.<br />This book is a good detailing of an organization that's received a well-deserved comeuppance.	2002-02-28

You can get through it in an hour or so.  It's the reflection it inspires that last a long time.<br />Basically, this book is the story to date of Horowitz's interaction with the reparations crowd, especially as it exists at America's universities.  It's told in a pretty relaxed way, much less polemic than his usual style, but this makes the story all the more chilling.  A number of ideas emerge:<br />1.  America's universities are no longer hospitable to the free discussion of ideas.  Instead, a bunch of left-wing bullies control the discourse.  When left-wingers can't silence through heckling or threats of violence, they immediately employ \\"sensitivity\\" to get administrations to silence ideas they don't like.<br />2.  Black Americans are encouraged to self-segregate and spend their years at university learning about anti-black bias and how to claim victim status.  The end result is that the gains of the civl rights era are being squandered.<br />3.  Left-wingers no longer wish to engage intellectually.  Instead, when an idea is deemed hostile, the person putting out the idea is labeled \\"racist\\", at which point they can be ignored.  Actually, accusations of \\"racism\\" are now sort of like waving garlic at a vampire: the accused is supposed to recoil in horror and immediately give up.  Much of the outrage of the left is concentrated on those who refuse to give up the ghost, but instead pursue their ideas.<br />4.  Newspapers more or less go along with the left.  Horowitz points out a \\"Time\\" magazine article where the most prominent part of the article was a picture of a woman holding a sign accusing Horowitz of racism.  The woman's whacky political convictions were never discussed.<br />5.  Black leadership preaches attitudes towards whites not far removed from what Hitler had to say about jews.  And there's a whole college movement devoted to furthering these ideas.<br />Horowitz may have started on reparations, but this book points out that America's universities by and large are leftist cess-pits, dedicated to nothing less than the destruction of America.  Think of this book as you would of turning over a rock in your garden.  You're not sure what you're going to find, but you know it's not going to be pretty.<br />David Horowitz deserves a lot of praise for attempting this Augean cleansing.	2002-02-01

Recasting the Mahabharata into modern India.<br />Two bits struck me:  the story of Karna, the driver's son, and Drona teaching the Panduva.  The first because of the way personal brilliance can be discounted on the basis of family tree; the second for the retelling of aiming at the crow and Drona's promise to Arjuna.<br />2.  The names.<br />Apart from the characters from the Mahabharata, there's also whole new cast of characters who reflect the modern world.  Two names stand out in my mind.  &quot;Gaga Shah&quot; is the story's name for the Aga Kahn.  Given the antics of the various Aga Kahns, &quot;Crazy Emperor&quot; is not a bad characterization.  Then there's Zinna as Karna - &quot;The Hacker Off&quot; - hacking off Pakistan - &quot;Karnistan&quot; - for himself.<br />3. Showing the relevance of myth.<br />Personally, I have a tendency to discount the mythos in favor of the logos, but mythos comes first, and recurs.  Casting the Mahabharata onto modern history is a great way to show there's nothing fundamentally new under the sun.<br />This book made for a great over-Christmas, by-the-fire-with-an-adult-beverage read.	2001-12-26

A couple of days ago I heard an NPR story about the rise in homelessness since the arrival in Washington of a Republican administration.  &quot;Right on time,&quot; I thought.<br />I mention this because it's mentioned in this book along with a number of other issues that &quot;go away&quot; during Democrat administrations and are used to flay Republicans.<br />If you listen to original sources and then listen to the reporting, you can identify case after case of left-wing bias in the major media.  Unfortunately for the media, the bias is so obvious and so at odds with reality that people simply stop listening.  It's a realization of Sillitoe's &quot;Here are the lies!&quot; from &quot;Travels in Nihilon.&quot;<br />This has not normally been remarked upon, people simply voting with their clickers.  Viewership of the news on the three major networks is in the toilet and people are turning to alternative news sources.  For myself, I find it odd that Chomsky can argue that there's some cabal of large corporations force-feeding us this tripe when people are obviously turning away from it.  The service Goldberg has done us is to point out that the emperor has no clothes.  For that alone he rates five stars.	2001-12-21

In the chapters that followed he showed examples of the principles in action, but then began to drift.<br />By the end of the book he'd returned to a recurring theme: his involvement with, and separation from, the Black Panther Party.  By then it was far from obvious how any of this might fit in with political war.  On top of which, if you've read his other books and his Salon columns you've already seen this material a number of times.<br />So, three stars.  Don't get me wrong.  I think DH is a great man.

That's the only real way to react to this book.<br />The story itself is sad enough: a kid born into poverty, denied education, drawn to revolution, and then betrayed by it.  <br />What makes it more sad is to look at Ireland and see just how much today's Ireland reflects the power grabs that went on during the War of Independence and the following Civil War, and have continued ever since.<br />Ireland today is ruled by an elite that comes directly from the 1916-1923 period.  Until the mid 1980's your only real political choices were Fine Gael and Fine Fail, two centrist parties whose only difference was over the 1922 peace treaty with England.  Both parties favor a strong central government, with all the evils strong central government brings - see Charley Haughey for a recent example.<br />Having grown up in, and run screaming from, Ireland, I can see Henry's growing enlightenment, which becomes my enlightenment and causes me then to reflect on Irish history from 1923 to the present day, and see just how much of it has been driven by power-hungry animals out to do well for themselves at the expense of all others.<br />And don't get me going about Irish anti-semitism.<br />It's enough to break your heart.	2001-01-01

First there's the atmosphere: the book completely captures the atmosphere of Ireland in the 1960's (and the 1970's, I guess).  I kept nodding my head as the iconography kept bringing  me home: guilt, poverty, drunkeness, snobbery, the Pope, John Kennedy, John  Wayne.  Then there's the insanity.  I think adults like to forget that a  child's thought processes are a lot different from theirs.  Francie's just  trying to function in a world that looks down on him and maltreats him.   He's just not mentally equipped to do so, and in the end it gets to be too  much and he snaps.  The description of this process is magnificently done:  the put-downs; the home life; the running away; the reform school; the loss  of mother, friendship, and innocence.  The only really odd thing about  Irish life is  that there are so few Francies.  I just can't say enough  good about this book.	2000-02-18

So much so that *I* dreamed of being a general.  I'm older now, and can see just how self-serving the book really is.  It's basically the work of a gigantic ego  paying homage to itself.  Lots of stress on all the things he did right,  nothing about the wrong.  For example, his flapper marriage is disposed of  in about two sentences, and there's no explanation of how he got caught  with his pants down, first in the Phillipines and then in Korea.  It's  almost as if he needed a crisis to be all that he could be.  Anyway, de  mortuis nil nisi bonum.

No-one has any ambition.   No-one's doing anything but partying and trying to look good.  Life is the  stimulation of nerve endings.  It makes you wonder why the characters  bother to live their sad little lives.  In tone, if not substance, this  book reminds me of &quot;Resentment,&quot; by Gary Indiana.

It must be his English background.  After reading David Horowitz, I never expected to see a left-winger present anything but excuse and coverup for the current  occupant of the White House. Hitchens tests that assumption by going over  the history of the Clinton administration and showing in short order what a  monster we have as President.  Zola couldn't have done better.  Beyond  that, there's the sheer brilliance of the language.  Hitchens' writing is  informed by his education and his concern for humanity.  It's inflamed by  Clinton's betrayal of all Hitchens holds dear.  The result is spare,  impassioned, sublime prose.  His treatment by Clinton's propaganda  buzz-saw: &quot;a pelting calumny.&quot;  Janet Reno: &quot;a biddable  mediocrity.&quot;  Brevity truly is the soul of wit, and Hitchens has wit  to spare.	1999-11-03

Every time I travel I bring a couple of thick books to pass the time.  Most recently  I read Ms. Miller's book, along with &quot;Inside the Arab World,&quot; a drier, more academic/statistical tome by Micael Field.  Her book is a first-hand account of her experiences in the Arab world, ranging across North Africa into the Middle East, and makes for compelling reading.  More importantly, her account dovetails nicely with Field's more academic observations.  I finished her book with some sadness: individual Arabs are generally kind, hospitable, generous, exhuberant, but for some dysfunctional reason, they generally want to be controlled by a tyrant.  The result is a world where rule is by terror, problems are solved by violence, corruption is rampant, and chaos is the norm.  Through all this, ordinary people try to live ordinary lives.	1998-03-23

I read everything in the English section of the local bookstore, and his &quot;New York Trilogy&quot; was one of the books I devoured.  The &quot;New York Trilogy&quot; stuck in my mind because of the relentless grayness and over-control of the lives described therein.  Everything was *so* carefully considered, including the assorted manias of the various dysfunctional characters.  &quot;Leviathan&quot; continues this grayness and over-control, to the tune of &quot;Sympathy for the Unabomber.&quot;  It plots the self-destructive trajectory of a writer accidentally turned protest-bomber and reads like a &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode produced by a really depressed team.  The strange thing about Auster's books is that, like a really bad traffic accident, they draw me as they repulse me, so that when I get about 90% of the way through one of them, I'm saying to myself &quot;For God's sake, put this thing down.&quot;  Then I finish.
