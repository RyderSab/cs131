To his credit he does a pretty good job of summarizing many of the ways that modern western society is badly discriminatory against men and has been getting much worse over the past few decades.  For example, among his many criticisms of women's rights for abortions he points out that the child who's future is being decides also has a father, and fathers have no rights and less consideration in today's debate over \\"a woman's right to choose.\\"  Hies effectively summarizes discrimination against men at work, in government, in schools, in law, in the military, in health care, in families, in the media and in just about every part of society today.  His summaries often take the immediately apparent or widely published discrimination and fail to look a little deeper.  For example he explains how Title IX enforcement has badly hurt college athletics, but fails to point out that Title IX is about education, not athletics, and if adequately enforced, would prohibit pervasive discrimination against men throughout the rest of college campuses.  Hise criticizes Janet Reno for the DOJ strong arm tactics in the Elian Gonzoles case, but fails to notice that Reno's tactics were supporting a father's rights to HIS son.  So in this report, Hise sloppily supports the war against fathers.  Hise criticizes Christian denominations for allowing themselves to be taken over by women, and points out that many Christian denominations which have been taken over by women are rapidly losing members.  But although he reports that many corporations are promoting women of questionable qualifications to their upper management, he fails to mention that many of those same major corporations with female management are losing money and market share.  As a highly knowledgeable reader I notice the omissions and inaccuracies, but for someone who is coming into awareness these omissions are minor compared to the wide ranging information in the book.   <br /> <br/>I was most disappointed in the Christian bias of the book.  Hise seems to assume that \\"men\\" is synonymous with \\"Christian,\\" despite his own data which shows that 80% of attendance and the large majority of administration of Christian churches is now female.  Men have never been the majority of attendees in Christian religion even when men once dominated it's administration.  Now it's pretty obvious from Hise's own data that men have left the Christian churches in huge numbers.  If he's trying to play to a Christian audience in the US, that means playing to an 80% female audience, according to his data.  What about us men?  What about the majority of us men, who now are not Christian?  The War Against MEN is being fought against us too.  We find most Christian churches as female dominated as schools and government, as Hise himself reports.  I would have been far more favorably impressed with Hise's book if he leaned a little less on equating men with Christian.   <br /> <br />One part of the book that is very good, and pretty unique, are the chapters on personal and political counter attack strategies.  While his suggested strategies are a little milquetoast to the more radical men's rights activists, they do give many men some real ways to begin to reclaim our manhood and work toward equal justice under law. It's good advice, and it's a place to start.  The book is worth while for those chapters alone.  Get a pre-nup before considering marriage, avoid the NY Times and LA Times for accurate news, start voting carefully in local elections.  All of these and more are things men can do right now to begin the reclaiming of our lives and families.   <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-07-14
US	49910606	R6BZHX1NFZ2B7	006073132X	150560620	Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything	Books	4	1	2	N	Y	And?	I'm left wondering what good is it.   For example there is a long chapter that reviews the popularity of children's names cross-referenced with race and income level of parents.  For example, from reviewing the data one could tell that some names for middle income white girls were slightly more popular among middle income families than for low income families in 1990, but the names that had been popular among middle income families in 1980 had become slightly more popular in the 1990s.  So what?  For young men and women today who got named something in 1980 it's 25 years too late for their parents to change what the kids were named.  And today's parents are naming their kids something else by now, whatever is popular, so the data collected in the 1990s is 15 years out of date.  The authors fail to show how any of this information is going to be more relevant than the price of yogurt on Mars.   <br /> <br />There is a chapter that talks about the relative fears vs. actual safety.  It uses an example of a parent who sends a child to play with a neighbor family that has a pool because the closer neighbor has guns and the parent is afraid of letting her child play with a gun owning family.  The authors point out that a child is 100 times more likely to die from the pool than from a gun, so the fear driven decision is irrational.  Another safety concern of parents is the car seat requirement.  While statistics show that putting children in care seats does reduce child injuries in car accidents, it's mostly from being in the back seat rather than the front seat, not from the $300 car seat.  The authors point out that a lot of common fear is generated by merchants with products to sell, such as $300 car seats, rather than real solutions to real risks.  But so what?  Are merchants going to stop using fear to sell products, or people going to wise up?  Somehow I doubt it.  <br /> <br />One chapter dealt with the wide decline of crime in the 1990s and correlated it to varioussupposed caused such as increased numbers of police, harsher prison sentences, etc.  The authors show that while other factors are part of the reduction in crime, the greatest cause for most of the reduction has been abortion of unwanted children who would have grown up in poverty and become criminals.  Statistically, no particular child of poverty has to become a criminal, but birthing more children into high risk lives assures a higher number of criminals in 20 years.  The tempting conclusion of that statistic is to favor mandatory abortion children from poverty families, or forced sterilization of poverty and drug addict mothers.  Of course such draconian measures would be politically unpopular for a variety of moral and ethical reasons, so we are left without the authors advocating any practical use for their statistical and economic information.  <br /> <br />It's an interesting book, and has a variety of unusual economic information, but little of value to anyone trying to formulate or advocate public policy.  What public policy, for example, does one advocate after finding out that \\"Sarah\\" was a popular name for middle income white girls in 1990?  Off hand, I can't think of any.  <br /> <br />	2005-06-28

This is a well documented discussion of how to get blood from a stone, or put another way, how to enforce indentured servitude, a form of slavery, to the maximum advantage.  It smacks of 17th century studies aimed a adjusting the size of cotton bales to maximize the total pounds of cotton each slave could load per day. What it fails to address is that indentured servitude, and all forms of slavery, have been illegal in the US since the Civil War.  Of course David Chambers is a professor of law, and therefore blinded to moral or ethical considerations that might have been in his book. Instead of elimination of a hateful system of servitude of men, he proposes a massive tax on all non-custodial men to pay women for breaking up our families and taking our children.  Unfortunatly you can't make wrong into right by doing wrong more effectively.  Like the 99lb \\"optimum\\" bale of cotton, an optimum way of extracting money from men has little merit.  Another father is driven to suicide every 6 minutes in the US after lawyers take away his family and bind him into the involuntary indentured servitude called \\"child support.\\"  This book fails to address any of the massive human toll or to propose any real solutions. It merely fantacizes about ways to tighten the already overstrained legal screws.  <br /> <br />I'm sure that attorneys, judges, and bureaucrats who earn their livings on the backs of emotionally distraught fathers who are already suffereing emotionally from the loss of their children will enjoy the read.   <br /> <br />	2005-06-14

The title is quite misleading.  The Amazon listing also says, \\"Book Illumination in the British Isles 600-800.\\"  Unfortunately that amendment is not shown on the cover, only on the inside title page and I missed it.  I find that contradictory anyway since classic Celtic culture had pretty much vanished by the end of the Roman Empire.  The title implies a book about painting of classic Celtic culture, a millennium spanning culture famous for it's art.  Unfortunately that's not what this book contains.  If you are looking for a book describing early Christian art from Irish Bibles this might be an excellent book to buy.  It wasn't what I expected after reading the title.   <br /> <br />The civilization generally called \\"Celtic\\" consisted of a number of culturally related tribes and peoples dispersed across Western Europe.  Celtic culture is generally identified by it's artwork including some very fine examples of sculpture, pottery, gold ornamentation, and painting which has been found in graves and other locations from Austria west.  Gaul was probably the center of Celtic culture in the centuries when the Celts were strong enough to sack Rome.  Many, many fine examples of Celtic art are still found in museums and galleries today.  When I opened this book after reading the title I expected to find plates and descriptions of classic Celtic art.  The word \\"CELTIC\\" is after all printed in huge letters on the top of the cover.  Anglo-Saxon art is less well known than Celtic art, and I was curious to learn how Anglo-Saxon art succeeds the Celtic art.  After all, the time period of the Anglo-Saxons was later than that of the Celtic culture.   <br /> <br />I was seriously disappointed with this book.  The works shown in this book are almost entirely from christian bibles other books drawn and inscribed by Christian monks.  The script in the plates (the paintings) is Latin or vulgate Latin, not the Celtic Ogham alphabet. Many of the symbols shown in the paintings are said bythe author to be of Persian origin.  Hello?  When did Persian Christian art become Celtic?   <br /> <br />I found no examples of art from the historic Celtic culture in this book.  Yes, the examples of early Irish Christian bibles were influenced by Celtic artistic history as well as Roman and Persian.  I don't really believe that a Persian inspired portrait of Saint Mathew or Jesus is \\"CELTIC painting,\\" even if the artist was Irish.  Missing entirely was art from a thousand years of Celtic culture before and during Roman occupation of Celtic lands.  As for Anglo-Saxon painting, you have to look really hard to find where that is even mentioned inside the cover.  <br /> <br />	2005-06-13

To me, a practical guide is something you can use step by step to accomplish something.  Doors to Other Worlds does give a pretty good survey of various kinds of \\"mediums,\\" table lifters, channelers, floor bangers, christian revival chit readers, healers, and Oija boards.  Some of the 19th century table lifters might have made the Las Vegas \\"magic\\" show circuit if they had lived today.  Buckland says that there aren't any left because entertainment has moved on to electronic media.   <br /> <br />I'm not sure who is being served by this book.  Experienced mediums, witches and psychics might enjoy reading the history of mediumship, complete with pictures of many 19th century spiritualists.  But for experienced mediums most of the \\"practical guide\\" instructions seem inane and useless.  Also left out are many of the usual cautions that teachers of such arts generally include.  For example students of talking boards such as the Oija are usually cautioned that you have no idea what spirit is guiding the message nor whether they are benevolent or malevolent.  Likewise channeling students are often cautioned, \\"Just because someone is dead it doesn't mean that they are smart.\\" Buckland seems to assume that every message received from spirits is valuable and somehow worthwhile.   <br /> <br />As a practical guide for beginners it's overly simplistic and glosses over much of the detailed practice, study, and training that one has to go through before someone can do the kind of things described.  Unless someone is born with a special gift, say for levitating tables, and who among us are, this \\"practical guide\\" contains little or nothing by way or guidance in how to really go about it.  Likewise automatic writing doesn't just happen by holding a pen while not paying attention.  I found very little of practical value or guidance that could be used as a \\"practicalguide\\" if the subtitle suggests step by step instruction on how to accomplish any of the things described.  If anything was given it was the description of how some of these \\"readings\\" might be faked.  I was left more with skepticism of the mediums than convinced in their authenticity.   <br /> <br />I did find the history of mediumship interesting and the survey of many psychic techniques worth the time spent reading the book.   <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-06-13

I have been using the National Construction Estimators for about 30 years now. I've found that their information is amazingly accurate. I first started using NCE for residential construction as a small contractor in the 1970s. During the 1980s and 1990s I used the latest revision for job costing at major government facilities. Since 2000 I'm using the latest edition to cost out repairs and upgrades to apartment buildings. Each year they get the latest prices and revise the book. This year is no exception, the latest edition is full of facts, figures, rules of thumb, detailed material costs, and everything you need to figure construction work from the smallest job to the largest. Whether you want to add up each spike and yard of concrete, or figure estimated complete subcontract work, this book gives you the tools.

US	49910606	R3T7O90J776JNW	0745626890	761641058	The Masculinities Reader	Books	2	10	66	N	N	Feminist views can't teach you about masculinity.	In the introduction the author states that feminism is the most important discourse of the 20th century.  He recites feminist dogma about men as if it were unquestioned fact, \\"sustaining unequal material advantage, opportunity, status, and privilege,\\" p-3.  I'm sorry, but I don't believe that feminism and feminist women have any more valid things to contribute to an understanding of men and masculinity than the National Socialists contributed to our understanding of Jews.   <br /> <br />The rest of the book continues to be a compilation of feminist men bashing couched in scholarly language.  For example, in essay 8, Naming Men as Men, the author starts out by claiming that many writers use \\"men\\" in the titles of their books but actually don't interview men in the text.  The author of this statement then cites feminist women to support his theory.  Much of this essay, like the others, is devoted to women and how men are now supposed to adjust to whatever women want.  In conclusion the authors says that \\"this chapter has sought ... to identify the gendered nature of power and power relations in contemporary organizations. In other words, it has repeated feminist dogma about men and power.   <br /> <br />One flaw that is pervasive is reliance on feminist writers as authorities on men, p-147 for example.  The book is supposed to be about men and masculinitites.  Why do they think that females have any clue about men and masculinity?  Do the authors review men and masculist literature?  Not so you would notice.  In addition, the feminist concept of \\"the patriarchy\\" is continually given credence as an accepted standard rather than recognizing it as misandrist propaganda.  A more reasonable approach to understanding men would be to forget the prevalent feminist theories and to start looking at men.   <br /> <br />Use of the concept of \\"the patriarchy\\" throughout this book is a dead giveaway at it's intent and focus.  As Sam Keen says in \\"Fire in the Belly, on Being a Man,\\"P-196, \\"Perhaps the best rule of thumb to use in detecting ideological feminism is to pay close attention to the ideas, moral sentiments, arguments, and mythic history that cluster around the notion of \\"patriarchy.\\"  \\"Patriarchy\\" is the devil term, the code word for the evil empire of men, the masculine conspiracy that has dominated human history since the time of the fall.\\"  In The Masculine Reader, \\"the patriarchy\\" is probably the most commonly used word and concept. Anyone wanting to learn about men and masculinity would be far better off reading Sam Keen.  <br /> <br />A serious discourse on men and masculinity is badly needed.  Unfortunately this book is very wide of the mark.  You can't learn about men by reading and believing the misandrist theories of anti-men feminism.  A better book real understanding of men is a serious need.   <br />	2005-04-21

I had heard on a radio home improvement program that concrete kitchen counters are popular in some other countries.  Complete Masonry has one chapter on concrete counter tops, but the example they give is an outdoor barbecue, not a kitchen.  The techniques can be adapted to a kitchen, but it's not the same as having illustrations of specifically what I want to do. <br /> <br />Other than that, Complete Masonry has lots of information for the home gardener or handy person.  You get pictures and details for laying out and construction of walks, stairs, patios, walls, ponds, rock gardens and all kinds of decorative and imaginative masonry work around the home.  It's aimed at the home improvement market, not for the professional mason, although a professional might get some creative ideas from it's illustrations.  Complete Masonry starts with very basic teaching such as \\"what is a shovel\\" and works up to include all the details you would need to construct the projects in the book.  Like a lot of Sunset books it's full of ideas and examples of very elaborate projects, though the projects appear to have been done by skilled professionals.  Even so, with a little practice you could probably finish any of the projects if you have a little construction skill and are willing to do the work.  It's a good idea book, and a practical how-to home improvement book.   <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-04-20

Throughout the book Ellis gives personal insights into the nature of women, how their nature led him down dead end relationships, and how much women disregard and even hate men.  For the \\"women's studies 101\\" misandrists they can see the fruits of their prejudice.  The women in Ellis's tale end up with worse dead end lives than he does. The women end up alone, unloved, unwanted, and lost.  That is going to be the fate of young feminist women, the fruits of their hatred, unless they make some radical changes and begin trying to get along with men.  Like Ellis, I don't expect the WS crowd to change any time soon and actually listen to a man's story such as this one.  It ought to be must reading, but none of them will read it.   <br /> <br />It ought to be on the bookshelf in every high school and college library, every Fraternity house and young man's bedroom. Page 246 has a program outline for a future \\"Men's Studies\\" curriculum that is legally required under Title IX at every university that teaches \\"women's studies.\\"   In a land that has no government commissions on men and men's issues, I learned that there are so many government women's commissions that they have to have an organization of women's commissions to keep them all straight, p-248.  One effective tactic that feminism has long used is \\"consciousness raising.\\"  Those of us men who are as old or older than Ellis lived through many consciousness raising episodes.  His book is a beginning of a consciousness raising for men.  Most of us are so used to being disrespected, used, abused, and kicked around that we are no longer even aware of it most of the time.  Ellis ought to be mandatory reading for all young men, and for women too.  <br /> <br />	2005-04-18

It has a lot of nice pictures, and some details about the more simple parts of framing with metal studs.  But it leaves a lot out.  Whenever anything gets complicated Mr. Clark says, \\"your foreman will tell you\\" what to do.  He doesn't explain to the reader how to decide what will be wanted.  That leaves out every reader who is a foreman level and above.  It's not a book for builders, contractors, architects, designers, engineers, supervisors, or anyone wanting to convert from light frame wood construction to metal framing construction.  For example, there are no structural calculation tables for bearing walls and no reference to where one might look to find structural calculation data for metal framing. One chapter talks about structural framing and mentions that the components are a heavier gauge than non-structural walls, but there is nothing to say how much heavier gauge is needed where, or how light of a gauge can be used in non-bearing walls either.  There is nothing about how to select the gauge or type of material for particular applications. All of that kind of information is left to \\"your foreman will tell you.\\"<br /><br />And, it's not very good for the workman on the job either.  My son bought my copy because he was out working on a commercial job where metal framing was required.  By the time he had gotten around to buying the book after working a few days, he had learned just about everything he needed to know from other workers.  It's not all that hard or complicated to bend down a few tabs.  He gave the book to me saying that he found little or nothing he could use on the job.  Yes, there are a few helpful hints here and there in this book, but overall it's a real disappointment whether you're a workman on the job or a supervisor wanting to know how to select material for the job.  Maybe it could be used for a classroom teaching of beginner framers.  They could get some good ideas before starting on the job site.e job site.  <br /> <br />	2005-04-13

In \\"Vittorio,\\" Rice departs from the usual list of characters, Armand, Pandora, Lestat, etc., to introduce another and only slightly related branch of the vampire family.  Vittorio was the son of a rich noble family from the mountains of northern Italy in the 16th century.  His family associates itself with the Medici of Florence, Italy, and tries to stay out of wars and politics.  Vittorio grows up learning both cultural knowledge of literature, mathematics, and art in addition to manly arts of knighthood. Unknown to Vittorio while growing up in the peaceful mountain valley castle of his family is the existence of a vampire cult called \\"The Court of the Ruby Grail.\\"  These vampires had, apparently for hundreds of years, demanded and received children, criminals, and other sacrificial victims from surrounding villages and nobles.  When Vittorio's father refuses their renewed demand for sacrificial children, the vampire cult kills his whole family.  Vittorio, who is only 16 years old, survives when he meets a young \\"girl\\" vampire and it's love at first sight.  In the subsequent chapters Vittorio gets captured and taken to the castle of the Ruby (blood) Grail vampires and learns of their horrors.  We are entertained by their blood red mass at midnight before a statue of Satan with sacrificial victims lined up at the communion rail to be bled dead.  We never are told where these vampires originated, but loyal Rice readers might presume that they may have come originally out of the Satanic vampires who have plagued Marius for many centuries.  Ursula convinces the elders to spare Vittorio once more and he is taken to Florence and dumped on a street.  He is taken in by monks associated with the Medici, for indeed as his father's heir he has a small fortune in the Medici banks.  From there he meets guardian angels, and they call a major angel.  They help him go back to destroy the Ruby Cult by daylight, but he can't destroy Ursula, his true love.  At nightfall she awakes and tricks him into becoming a vampire himself.  True love has triumphed over vampires and angles, and the two of them live together happily ever after.  <br /> <br />This book raises the philosophical question of whether or not it is acceptable to sacrifice the infirm and helpless of a society for the others to be wealthy and prosperous.  Both in Vittorio's family lands, and in the town of Santa Maddalana, the people had sacrificed their children and their week in order to prosper.  They had no crime, no infirm, no sick, no plague, none of the suffering that usually plagues human society.  But is prosperity and peace worth the horrible price?  The question has troubled philosophers and politicians for a long time.   <br /> <br />[Note:  The Ruby Grail cult apparently numbered about 46 vampires.  In Rice's vampire novels, every vampire needs about 1 victim's blood per day. That comes to about 16790 victims per year, or significant city in the 16th century.  It comes to about 840,000 deaths in a 50 year human lifetime, more than even the largest cities.  That seems to me to be a non-sustainable depletion of human population.] <br /> <br />	2004-09-22

The story of Pandora fills in more of the holes in Rice's vampire series.  Pandora has been mentioned previously in more than one novel, and is a significant minor player in Blood and Gold, the story of Marius.  In Pandora we hear about her childhood growing up in a rich Roman family. Marius who is not yet a vampire, is the younger son of another family.  She meets Marius in Rome at age 10, and at age 15 her father refuses Marius' request for her in marriage. For some unknown reason, when Pandora is age 35, one of her brothers causes the other members of her family to be assassinated in a political plot. Pandora flees with Jewish merchants to Antioch where she meets Marius again. By now Marius is a vampire and keeper of the ancient mother of vampires.  Much of her story describes her trials getting settled in Antioch, another conflict with her traitor brother, her conversion to a vampire by Marius, and the first attack by Satanic vampires.  Little is told about the subsequent 1800 years before she ends up in a Paris caf where she writes the story. I found it to be an entertaining afternoon read.  I enjoyed Rice's obvious research into Roman life, but I was disappointed in not learning more about her life during the centuries while Marius searched for her. For example, we learn nothing of the Indian vampire with whom she apparently spends centuries traveling around the capitols of Europe during the Middle Ages. Maybe Rice is saving that for another volume.   <br />	2004-09-22

Bonewits greatly expands the material in print on this subject. He brings together his knowledge from many years of hands on ritual work and makes it accessible to neopagan clergy in a clear and understandable manner. Bonewits begins with a whole chapter of definitions of words used in neopagan religion but poorly understood by many. Even someone who's been teaching pagan rituals for decades can take time to ponder the definition of &quot;worship,&quot; &quot;rite,&quot; of &quot;liturgy.&quot; Chapter 2 discusses the commonalties that neopagan rites have with those of other large and small religions. The elements that are needed to be effective in a religious ceremony in one religion are also needed to be effective in the next. And what is a religious ceremony anyway? For that matter what is a religion? There is a chapter on people factors, how do you prepare for and deal with a wide variety of different people who may show up at your rituals. You may get people who are loud or quiet, have physical or mental disabilities, etc. Other thins deal with preparations, briefings, rehearsals, manna, magic, and what to do when things go wrong. There are too many topics to list in a review.  <br />  <br /> Rites of Worship is not a cookbook for neopagan rituals, it is rather instructions on designing your own rituals, and essential knowledge that can be gained either from making all the mistakes yourself or learning from someone with decades of actual experience. I would recommend this book to everyone studying to be neopagan clergy.  <br />  <br />	2004-07-24

From the overleaf we expect an expose' of brainwashing and indoctrination. He breaks that promise on the first page of Chapter 1.  It's not that Shapiro objects to universities indoctrinating youth, he's just mad because they don't indoctrinate them with his views.  In chapter 1, Shapiro complains that universities are NOT teaching (his) moral absolutes.  I purchased the book looking for information about how universities might be teaching one sided political agendas, and I agree with Shapiro's complaints about the overboard advocacy of racism, feminist sexism, gay/lesbianism, and other leftist political agendas. But the main point of this book is the lack of teaching of right wing moral values, not what is suggested by the title. Some of it is just poorly written.  For example he cites a Google search as scholarly research. Some of it is Christian religious dogma; for example he claims that The Bible was written by one person, God.  What about Mathew, Luke, Mark, and the others? Shapiro goes way beyond objecting to leftist one-sided teaching and demands one-sided right wing teaching.  He argues that science classes ought to teach divine creation instead of evolution. He demands teaching of moral absolutes instead of telling the students that they have to find their own.  The book is raging hypocrisy.  He claims to expose indoctrination and brainwashing while criticizing universities for failing to indoctrinate and brainwash with his agenda.  Overall it's a poorly written rant with confused objectives and a hard core right wing fundamentalist christian agenda.	2004-07-11
US	49910606	R1GTBQQCS55DO6	0060987529	558936324	Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Stretched a little thin	I bought Confessions after reading and enjoying Maguire's Wicked.  In Confessions Maguire weaves a tale of how the ugly stepsisters come to be in the situation of the common fable.  In this version, the evil stepmother comes to Holland with her two daughters after leaving her husband in the dark of night.  We are originally told that he was killed by an angry mob of villagers, but as the tale goes on we become less and less certain of how and why that happened, or if he was even killed. Evil stepmother arrives broke in a Dutch town and eventually becomes housekeeper for a merchant of some means.  After a few months she poisons the merchant's wife and takes over the household. She hopes to use his money to acquire finery, but her greed causes her to push him into risky ventures and big losses.  Finally she sets her hopes on marrying one of her daughters, Iris, to a Prince who is coming to town seeking a wife. <br />I found the story to be overly contrived in many places, stretching the credibility of characters and the scene to breaking.  Gregory apparently tried to make the story as unusual as possible to be in the spirit of the original Cinderella story, but I think he overdid it.  The master painter also paints the unspeakably hideous, the stepmother is not only mean she's a murderess, the daughter Cinderella is not only beautiful she's been kidnapped and kept hidden away, the father is not just henpecked he's financially ruined and psychologically destroyed, all in all it's unreality pretending to be reality and a little much.  <br />Maguire also takes all the magic out of the story.  There isn't any magic fairy godmother, and no magic slippers.  The golden dress, carriage, and shoes have a mundane explanation.  It was an interesting read, but not as much fun as Wicked, not as humorous, not as magickal, and not as much of a reversal of characters from the other perspective.  In Wicked Dorothy ends up an assassin and the Witch of the West kind heated if misunderstood, but in Confessions the evil stepmother is still evil. Cinderella isn't as browbeaten as in the original fairy tale, but she's still suffering under an evil stepmother who murdered her mother and badly hurt her father.  So I give it 4 stars.  It's an entertaining story and fun to get a different perspective.	2004-07-09
US	49910606	REXN1UFALX52R	0738705764	395273788	When I See The Wild God: Encountering Urban Celtic Witchcraft	Books	4	5	8	N	Y	Wild God in every MAN	There is a Wiccan tradition myth that men learn from women and women learn from men.  Over the past half century there has probably been more Wiccan women willing to teach men than willing to learn from men, as De Angeles alludes to in her second chapter. Through this book she sets out on a journey to teach men about Wicca. <br />Most of the book is similar to many books on basic Wicca.  De Angeles' approach is to use a lot of Celtic words and God names rather than plain English like many other similar books.  She also, in the introduction, says that she is focusing on teaching men.  There are chapters on basic Wiccan techniques such as calling quarters, invocation of Gods, blessing your tools, and so forth.  I found the Celtic names both interesting and confusing, although it might be a good way to learn a few Celtic words.  The Gods she writes about are mostly Celtic which seems to be the focus of her own practice.  She briefly mentions other Gods such as Bel, who was known throughout the ancient world, but only briefly without the identification and connections. We get only the reflection of Bel as He was known in Celtic lands.  De Angeles includes basic ritual outlines that a beginner of no specific tradition could use in ritual. <br />One chapter on Scholar and Warrior stresses non-violence, a modern view that I personally can't find much historical support for.  Certainly it's not from Celtic warriors of history such as Brennus or Vercingetorix.  I suspect that De Angeles' the peaceful warrior philosophy comes from modern feminist or certainly female philosophy, and not from Celtic traditions.  Perhaps she could do with more learning from men as well as teaching men. <br />I found her Appendix on \\"To Ride the Tiger\\" especially pleasing.  It's all about love and sex the Wild God.  In some deep way Wicca is about wildness, and the wild God of life and love in the earth and in each of us.  De Angeles approaches this topic several times in various chapters.  <br />Overall it's a pretty good book for men who are starting out in Wicca or even progressing along a Wiccan spiritual life and want to reclaim the magic of our Celtic ancestors.  De Angeles makes a big point of connecting with one's own ancestors, and thus those of Celtic ancestry, or even partly Celtic ancestry can find magic in its pages.	2004-07-09

Speak the truth and let the chips fall where they may.<br />Elder confronts the sacred cows of PC belief head on.  He takes on racism, sexism, the medical industrial complex, the decline of marriage, the liberal media, and other \\"unspeakable\\" topics without flinching.  He describes going to a library in a poor section of LA.  Outside several \\"oppressed\\" youth are skateboarding on the sloped landscaping.  Inside only Korean kids study, not a single \\"oppressed\\" minority kid.  The largest part of the book is about the black racism and black victimology, combined with white condescension.  Elder well describes how these forces combine to keep so many blacks from achieving decent lives. <br />Elder goes on to confront the myth of the \\"Glass Ceiling\\" and the faux medical crisis.  He shows how these myths create huge problems for society with their lies and faux victims. Other topics where \\"what everyone knows\\" is ripped apart are the war on drugs, gun control, the welfare state.  <br />Neither is Elder just spewing a republican or democratic view.  One chapter is entitled \\"There isn't a dime's worth of difference\\" and he blasts both parties for failing utterly to address any of the most important social issues of our time.  <br />I thoroughly enjoyed the book, but perhaps that is because I agree with Elder on virtually ever issue.  I don't know if anyone who wants to continue believing the status quo cultural myths will read and learn, but they ought to.	2004-07-09
US	49910606	R124SVQNXAGBBA	0312858310	728673628	Witchlight	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Not her best work	I read Witchlight over a weekend as a fill in and relaxation.  The plot focuses on a woman &quot;Winter&quot; who lost her memory due to some psychological trauma, and is struggling to regain her memory before the evil demon becomes too strong.  For me, that kind of plot is questionable at best and this one tries our imagination way beyond credibility.  While I sympathize with authors who use common nouns for names, &quot;Winter&quot; was a name that was often confusing in context.  In the plot, Winter and some college students began dabbling in dark magick some years ago and formed a magical group where they conjured an artificial elemental, but were too inexperienced to clean up after themselves.  Winter gets pregnant, leaves her ne'er do well boyfriend and goes home to her abusive though rich parents.  She forgets all about college (including the abortion and the magic) and becomes a successful Wall Street broker.  Some years later her ex-boyfriend is almost killed in a motorcycle crash and is in a coma for years.  Lost in limbo land between life and death he tries to make contact by summoning the artificial elemental which is still wandering aimlessly around the nether reaches of darkness.  It begins to haunt the former members of the college circle, and Winter's torment begins.  The book deals with how she tries to remember all that she's forgotten.  Most of the other characters are cardboard, including the two professors at the psychic Institute where she turns for help, but rejects most of the help.  Action is stilted and unnatural.  Memory loss is treated in unrealistic ways.  The artificial elemental is either very, very powerful or weak depending on plot at the time.  Winter turns out to have psychokinetic power to destroy electric devices and other things.  And after the long build up the ending is trivial.  It just stops, the elemental goes away, and they live happily ever after.  I was disappointed.	2004-06-15

Contributors include well known neo-pagan writers such as Judy Harrow and Otter G'Zell, some pagan scholars like Dennis Carpenter, Ph.D., and some authors who's names I didn't recognize.  I found myself wishing the editor had included a brief bio, CV, or credits for the various contributors. That's a serious fault.<br />The first section is about &quot;The Goddess,&quot; a popular but somewhat increasingly controversial view of Wicca and witchcraft.  Significantly lacking is co-equal focus on The God.  Left out is any significant mention of the harmony and equality between Goddess and God that are important to many neo-pagans.  The publication date is 1996, so perhaps it is understandable many neo-pagans were still being overwhelmed by feminism, &quot;The Goddess&quot; and &quot;women's spirituality&quot; largely originating in California.<br />One chapter deals with pagans who try to mix Jesus with paganism, and hold to both conflicting religions.  The author describes how some pagans are unwilling to give up cultural Christianity even though they also have adopted The Goddess or other pagan religious teachings.  Asatru and the Norse traditions of neo-paganism is covered in another chapter.<br />The scholarly approach to paganism begins to bring pagan religion into mainstream theological study.  One chapter deals with the psychology of being a marginal person who's values are different than the cultural norms.  One chapter describes the phenomenon of summer gatherings.  Still other chapters deal with the possible origins of Wiccan theology and morality.  Published by a University this volume makes neo-paganism more accessible to scholars of psychology, sociology, or theology, and can be a resource for any scholar writing a research paper on the emergence of new-paganism.	2004-05-07

Well, hers are not the stereotypes of black robes and pointy hats, but they include priests demanding sex for rituals and arrogant priestesses.  Sure, there is some truth in all stereotypes, but do we really need another rehash of the worst ones about Wicca?  In addition she is much to focused on Salem, MA, for a book of nationwide interest.  Yes, it's a \\"Witch City\\" tourist trap, and yes, it does get a lot of media attention on Halloween, but no, her local gossip is not relevant to 99% of American Wicca. Her advice to Wiccans not to go to Salem on Halloween and parade for cameras is good. One page included a mistaken lecture on the Old English pronunciation of \\"Wicca.\\" She apparently read it somewhere, because I've seen the same mistaken rant elsewhere recently.  <br />There is a lot to like in the \\"Out of the Shadows\\" too.  There is advice on how to meet the media, what to say and wear.  Another chapter deals with legal issues that a Wiccan might face at work, and considerations about church deductions and the IRS.  One chapter identifies 3 things that Wiccan beginners say which immediately identify them as beginners.  One was not to say that your ancestor was burned for witchcraft in Salem.  It is my personal gripe that she goes along with the current Salem Chamber of Commerce denial that there were any actual Witches who were victims at the Salem trials. Several of those convicted admitted that they were \\"witches,\\" but their names have been scrubbed from the current CofC denials. She escapes with a quibble over the definition of \\"witch.\\"  She's probably right though, that living in Salem she probably hears it a lot more than is credible.  That again is more applicable to her local area than the rest of America.  The other 2 beginner identifiers she lists, \\"grandmother witch\\" and \\"shaman training\\" are indeed wide spread beginner faux pas.  <br />The chapter on witch wars was a little shallow, although kudos to McLelland for fessing up and admitting her own part in one some years ago.  <br />Overall it's a pretty good book, and will be useful to someone who wants an overall survey about Wicca.  It is good too that some of the skeletons in the closet are hung out to wither away in the sunshine of public knowledge.	2004-05-04

As the cover suggests it focuses primarily on the &quot;elementals,&quot; air, water, fire, and earth from a Wiccan perspective. Deborah explains clearly why things are done the way they are, providing understanding instead of merely giving recipes or how-to instructions. I would suggest this book for novices who are working with a coven or teacher.  It will help the novice to understand why the teacher does things in a particular way and not some other way, what options might be chosen instead, and how that would change the ritual.  It could provide a basis for discussion of the ritual design with the teacher. It's a good &quot;text book&quot; if you will for a teacher to assign to her or his students.  For a more experienced reader it has a broad perspective and descriptions of other ways to do the same thing that you may not have thought about in a while.<br />She discusses the mythological difference between directions, elementals, and guardians. Why, for example, do many Wiccans limit directions to 4, leaving out up, down, center, spirit, in, out, forward, backward, or any others that some groups add? Deborah Lipp often gives more than one example of how you might do the same thing rather than just &quot;do it this way.&quot;  She explains why you might choose each version.  In reviewing the book I found that she reminded me of several aspects of ritual that I had learned years ago but had not thought of recently and I enjoyed the review of principles. <br />In part &quot;Elements of Ritual&quot; is similar to a lot of other beginner books of which we have seen too many over the past few years.  However, Deborah Lipp's offering is one of the best of those, and is aimed at more serious students than your run of the mill &quot;teenage witch&quot; book.  Yes, those who are focused on one particular tradition will find things to disagree with, as you will with any book written by anyone but yourself, but that's where you have a talk with your teacher or priest/ess about how your practice differs from hers. <br />As another reviewer already said, the advanced student of the Craft might be more interested in reading Grey Cat's &quot;Deepening Witchcraft,&quot; or some others targeted on a more advanced audience.  For a beginner's textbook that includes why as well as what and gives alternatives, &quot;Elements of Ritual&quot; is pretty good.	2004-05-02

Sidoli combines Jung's theory of the psyche with Fordham's theory of the primary self and some of her own original thoughts into a combined work on how disruptions of normal childhood bonding at an early age can have profound affects later in life.  The book is heavily written in psychobabble jargon and theory.  It is aimed at those who are schooled in psychology rather than a popular audience.  Much of the book consists of long descriptions of individual patients from her clinical experience.  While this is common in psychological books, &quot;anecdote&quot; is not synonymous with &quot;data.&quot;  One can selectively choose examples to illustrate virtually any theory, and the examples given only consist of the author's opinion about the examples. Personally, I found the long descriptions of individual actions and weeks of therapy meetings with particular clients to be tedious, irrelevant and essentially meaningless.  The conclusions are that children who have bonding and relationship problems at a very young age, from birth onward and perhaps even before, often have resultant psychological and physical problems later in life.  These same problems often cause parents to do a poor job as parents, and continue the cycle to subsequent generations.  Personally I prefer plain language to psychobabble, but professional and amateur psychologists will enjoy the level of theory that is found in the book.  It's interesting, well thought out, well presented, and aimed at a scholarly audience.	2004-04-29

Ellen Cannon Reed's last volume is perhaps her best.  She is now gone from this plane, and her passing was something of a shock to those of us who had the privilege of meeting her.  Before passing from this life she left us with her wisdom of the Wiccan path that she had learned through years of hard work, years of dedication to her religion and spiritual path, and years of helping others to find the true Heart of Wicca.  In Heart of Wicca, Ellen talked about what it means to follow an initiatory mystery path, rather than just another religion.  She explains why coven study is so important to those who sincerely want to follow in her footsteps and be initiated into the mysteries of Wicca.  Sure, she says, you can learn it by yourself, but very few manage to do so.  The initiation comes from the Gods, not from the elders who help you to find your way.  The mystery is that which can not be explained but must be experienced for yourself, and few will find it without a guide.  In a few pages Ellen explains what Wicca is and why it is so powerful to those who are initiates.  We now recommend Heart of Wicca to everyone who wants to follow a Wiccan path, but doesn't know where to begin, or how to filter out all the many \\"how to\\" books now on the market.  She writes about covens, about teachers, about religion, about mysteries, about magick, about students, about initiation, and about Wicca.  She tells beginners what they need to know to start on the path, and she explains to Wiccan Elders how to think about teaching the beginners.  Ellen's wisdom is timeless, and we are grateful for this book of Crone's wisdom that she left for us.	2004-04-27

I found the continuous vampire killings to have become boring after the previous books.  The explanation of how Lestat gets involved with Christian theology is strained and confused.  I finished it to find out how it ended, but reading it got tedious.  I can't decide if it's vision is over reaching, or maybe Rice was working to hard to top her previous efforts and fell short.

The story is about some alien world, Diamondia, where some energy eating alien species adopted human food and mannerisms some centuries ago but now have started a very bloody war against the half billion humans who now inhabit their planet.  Compounding the mix are the Earth Federation and some mysterious telepathic &quot;darkness&quot; that takes over people's brains.  Our hero is from the Earth Federation Negotiating Committee who is there to negotiate peace, or let the humans fall to cut expenses.  Various factions plot against each other in a confused tapestry of irrational but deadly subplots.  Technology on this fictional planet ranges from extremely futuristic to mundane 20th century.  Taxies are very much like 20th century earth.  Psycho hypnosis projectors are futuristic.  We're also supposed to believe that the alien prostitutes are suitable and more fun than human prostitutes.  Some allusion is made to conflict between human men or &quot;males&quot; as the author calls them and the women who have not joined the &quot;women's union.&quot;  I found it confused, dull, and disappointing.  Read it if you're a die hard Van Vogt buff or student of 20th century Sci Fi classics.	2004-03-01

It's a charming saga of prehistoric peoples somewhere in California.  Our heroine gets afoul of her husband for adultery, and decides to run off instead of facing the death penalty allotted to her. Her angry husband and his brothers follow her for weeks with murderous intent.  During her escape we read of her many exploits trying to throw them off her trail, the birth of her baby alone in a cave, and how she manages to cross a raging river with the newborn.  Always heading west, finally she's taken in by a coastal tribe.  Meanwhile the coastal tribe has their own problems.  The mammoth migration has declined in recent years and they are forced to look elsewhere for a home. The angry husband eventually shows up and a deadly confrontation results.  I found the story readable.  The battered wife, angry husband confrontation is a bit overdone.  Do we really believe that he would spend a year and risk death to find and kill a adulterous woman who ran off and kept going?  I didn't believe it.  The disaster that befalls the coastal tribe is a little overboard too, but I guess it's almost believable.  With those exceptions it's a good entertaining read for the hot tub on an afternoon.	2004-03-01

Now on the top half of the Captains list, Hornblower is given command of a small squadron of ships and sent north in as much of a political gambit as a naval one.  There are no real naval threats to Hornblower's fleet, a few coastal raiders on British shipping, but the one they find is easily dispatched.  Forester spends time detailing the use of bomb vessels, ungainly ships with large mortars in the center.  They are used to shell and destroy a ship in a harbor and enemy positions on shore.  When Napoleon attacks Russia he sends one army north towards St. Petersburg along the eastern most end of the Baltic, and of course Commodore Hornblower is there to save the day and negotiate a switch of sides by the Prussians. It's a little short on naval lore and a little long on period politics. A contrived dalliance with a Russian lady gives Hornblower flees, and then typhus. At the time it was written it was pretty unusual to have an adulterous affair in a fiction of this kind. It gives more variety to our understanding of British Naval operations in another area of the world.	2004-02-28

There are countless sad stories of children who have been taken from their parents homes and put into foster care where they were tortured or killed.  Even if there is some valid suspicion about the parents, the cure is often much worse than the problem.  In what has grown into a huge and insane monster, the CPS industry breaks up families and destroys lives with no legal hearings, or even legal recourse for those who are targeted.

Hornblower is in a Spanish prison in Rosas after sacrificing his ship Sutherland by attacking and destroying an enemy fleet.  Along with his loyal lieutenant Bush and his servant Brown, Hornblower is soon loaded on a carriage for the trip to Paris where he is to be hanged as a public display by Napoleon.  But of course it's hard to hang a man when the author is on his side.  The carriage breaks down in a snowstorm and as luck would have it there is a river and a boat nearby.  Always a man of action Hornblower makes his escape and stumbles into the home of a left over royal sympathizer who helps his party to hide until spring when they can make their way down river and escape.  In the French port, Hornblower assumes the identity of a Dutch officer, commandeers a captured English cutter, Witch of Endor, and a crew of slave laborers to sail out of the harbor under French noses.  Despite his constant self doubt he returns triumphantly to England where he finds out that during his absence his wife died, his beloved Barbara's husband died, and instead of losing his rank for losing his ship he is knighted to the order of the bath for heroism (and politics).

After returning home from a very successful voyage to the Americas Captain Hornblower is assigned to a larger ship of the line with two gun decks, the Sutherland. He is assigned to the fleet blockading the Mediterranean coast of Spain where Napoleon's French fleet and the Spanish navy are prevented from supplying Napoleon's armies.  In classic Hornblower style Hornblower isn't content to sail idly back and forth, so he finds ways to attack harbors, canals, and a French army near the shore. After several courageous engagements Hornblower becomes the only English ship between 4 enemy vessels and their safe harbor.  The remainder of the English fleet is over the horizon, several hours away under sail in light winds.  Following orders from the fleet Admiral Hornblower attacks all four, severely damaging three of them before the superior weight of the more numerous enemy fleet renders his ship useless.  The wreckage drifts down current into the lee shore and a Spanish harbor where Hornblower is captured.  As usual, Hornblower is filled with self doubts.  If he ever escapes will he be stripped of his rank or even hanged for losing his ship?  Will he ever see his beloved Barbara, wife of the Admiral, again?

The first half deals with Hornblower's trip home to England as a passenger on a water hoy (a supply ship that brings water to ships of the line).  The water how is such a dog that after several days of beating back and forth they are still where they began.  When they finally do get a fair wind they are chased by a larger French brig and only by some of Hornblower's usual trickery and bravado do they turn the tables and escape.  The battle is a little too unbelievable for me; it relies too much no surprise and a sleeping French crew, which I found beyond the realm of possible. Nevertheless our hero returns safely to England. <br />The second part of the book is another short story about how Hornblower was assigned to be some kind of spy in Spain to deliver fake messages ordering the Spanish fleet out to sea.  It's more plausible, but a short story.  <br />Despite its shortcomings, the detail of ships and sailing in the early 19th century make the Hornblower series must reading for any man who loves the sea.	2004-02-26

Beat to Quarters was the first of the Hornblower books that Forester wrote.  It's a tale of adventure off the west coast of Central America during the early part of the 19th century.  Among the problems that Captain Hornblower faces are the changing politics of Spain, are they on our side, or against us. Are we supporting the rebels fighting Spanish rule, or helping them?  Hornblower has to capture a much larger Spanish ship twice, once from the Spanish, and once from the rebels he turned it over to.  Like all the Hornblower adventures, Forester includes a lot of detailed description of the daily life and hardships of life in the English Navy during the age when ships were of wood and men were of iron. After his final sea battle, which sinks his prize and prevents him from gaining prize money, Hornblower has to careen his own ship on a hidden beach to patch it up before the long trip home.  He meets Lady Barbara in Panama, who is to be his future wife and love, but that is for a later story.  Whether you read them in the order written, Beat to Quarters first, or in chronological order of Hornblower's life, it's a rousing good tale of the sea, of men and of honor.	2004-02-26

Truth or Dare is more of a prejudicial feminist hate piece about men than it is about Wicca or paganism.  For example, chapter 2 provides us with feminist revisionist history, with a catch.  Starhawk goes on about how ancient men were conscripted into armies and dehumanized or killed, and then concludes with &quot;and that's how women have been oppressed by patriarchy.  I read that chapter conclusion and said &quot;huh?&quot; what did I just read.  There is nothing in the chapter to support her prejudicial conclusion, in fact the reverse is supported.  Every chapter seems to out-prejudice the preceding one.  The text is deceptive.  It seems to be positive but has an undercurrent of misandry.  After each chapter I found that I was angry at the misandry I had read and would take a week to cool down before trying to read the next chapter.  After 5 or 6 chapters I figured out that I really didn't like it on a deep emotional basis and stopped reading.  Men hating feminist pagans all love it because it supports and encourages their misandry.	2004-02-23

I first read the original edition many years ago when I was just discovering Wicca and it was all the rage.  Starhawk's Spiral Dance inspired a huge number of young women to become Wiccan but with a price.  Wicca is a religion of harmony and balance between God and Goddess, it is not a \\"Goddess religion.\\"  Nor is there a real place in Wicca for feminist men-bashing and separatist misandry. For two decades many people believed that Wicca was a \\"women's spirituality\\" rather than a balanced and harmonious religion for everyone.  What was gained by the beautiful writing and poetic mysticism is lost in the divisiveness and misdirection.  The original edition of Spiral Dance wasn't as polarized and hateful to men as later works by Starhawk or the more recent revisions of the Dance.  If one can get past her misandry she has a lot of creative vision.  It isn't another spell book, and that part is good. But in the end she has never given up being Jewish.	2004-02-23

The authors take a pragmatic approach to the subject of the many round decorations that have graced barns and homes of Pennsylvania for hundreds of years.  Especially among Pennsylvanians of &quot;Deutch&quot; or German ancestry, the fancy round &quot;hex signs&quot; are a cultural identification as well a decoration for their barns.   Perhaps these signs also have magickal meaning as a ward or protection.  The term &quot;hex&quot; means a magic spell in German, and &quot;hexen&quot; means witch.

One of the problems one encounters is that while the geographic descriptions in the novels are pretty good, it takes a good bit of imagination to follow the adventures around the real estate.  The Companion solves this problem by providing maps of each scene of action and reference points to follow.  Horatio would never have put to sea without a good map, and neither should you.  The last half of the Companion is the &quot;biographer's&quot; story of how he came to write each novel.  Frequently he was on a cruise or vacation somewhere and imagined sea battles taking place where his cruise ship now leisurely sailed.  It's interesting to see how Horatio's life unfolded.	2004-02-21

Much of the futuristic speculative science is not yet either obsolete nor proven impossible 60 years later.  Some of the high-tech foreseen by Vogt includes genetic engineering that was used to modify natural mutant humans for various reasons.  There is a war between the one class of mutant/gene-altered people and normal people.  The gene-altered mutants have taken over Mars and are launching a major space war on the 5 billion normal humans on Earth.  The Martians have thousands of huge and heavily armed space ships that earth science, for some reason, has not developed. There are some psychic mind reading mutants who are hated by everyone, but they secretly control the Earth government.  Our hero finds abandoned underground machine shops left by the mutants, and single-handedly builds a space ship much more capable than anything the Martians can manage. He also finds time to build a fortress disguised as a farm defended by an array of super beam weapons, and lots of other unique stuff all in abut 3 years.  In the end he finds true love and the book ends with the Martian attack still imminent.  The portrayal of racial hate of mutants by normal humans appears to reflect the 1940s racial attitudes and irrational hatreds that were much in contention during W.W.II.

Much of the futuristic speculative science is not yet either obsolete nor proven impossible 60 years later.  Some of the high-tech foreseen by Vogt includes a society run by a mega-computer which selects leader based on a mental discipline and philosophy called &quot;Null-A.&quot;  Our hero enrolls in the annual selection by the computer after some years of study.  Selected winners are sent to an imaginative colony on Venus. Everything in perfect order, until he finds out that his brain has been tampered with, he isn't who he thinks he is, and nothing is as it seems.  The Earth is a pawn in a galaxy wide political plot wherein one evil dictator is planning to destroy Earth and Mars as and use it as justification to start a huge interstellar war.  Our hero finds out that his brain has been genetically augmented to give him extra abilities, and his body is being cloned and the clones receiving his mental patterns so that when he is killed the clone takes over without loss, a sort of immortality.  Typical of early sci-fi the characters are mostly cardboard cutouts.  There is a woman in the plot, and he almost but not quite manages a relationship.  In Vogt style it ends when he gets tired of writing without the reader finding out what ever became of the space war.  Still, it's an entertaining read on a lazy afternoon.	2004-02-21

Pinker seems to have a hard time deciding whether he's writing for a popular audience or a scholarly audience.  Blank Slate is full of references and names of previous researchers as a work written for scholars would have, but has a rambling intuitive style more common in popular works.  The first part of the book defines a sociological theory called &quot;The Blank Slate&quot; as the assumption that all kids are born blank and learn everything from their culture, nurture, as opposed to nature.  He then spends several chapters giving arguments why a &quot;blank slate&quot; theory doesn't fit human experience.  In the last half of the book Pinker expounds on applications of human nature to social and ethical questions such as gang violence and politics.  He gives us a theory as to why someone who favors a free economy most likely wants social controls limiting individual behaviors.  In his chapter on &quot;Gender,&quot; Pinker talks about feminism saying, &quot;most women don't consider themselves feminists... yet they agree with every major feminist position. (p-343).  It is plainly apparent throughout the book that Pinker probably doesn't consider himself a feminist, yet he agrees and supports every major misandrist feminist position.  Perhaps it comes from the intellectual collegiate society where misandrist feminism is required to stay employed or get your book published.  There are many dogmatic PC beliefs stated as facts that are either wrong or contradict other theories.  I wondered for a while if he put those in as a nod to on-campus PC-feminism so the book could be written, or if he really believes them.  By the end of the book its clear that he really believes all those PC stereotypes and assumptions. In the last part of the book he rambles on about &quot;the arts&quot; and literature, fields that are obviously way out of his expertise. A more discerning reader can skip over the political agenda and gain some insight into human nature.

The back cover begins with a list of cultural stereotypes about men, beginning with &quot;Why do men have to control the TV remote and channel-surf?&quot;  Some men do, and some women do, but many men don't.  Throughout the book Gurian uses contemporary psychobabble to justify and reinforce all the men-negative stereotypes that a female dominated culture has promoted over the past 50 years.  Despite the title he continually digresses to talking about women and women's brains frequently throughout the book.  Occasionally Gurian approaches toward some real insight about men, but each time quickly backs away into a morass of jargon and the same old stuff in a new wrapper.  He describes himself as a &quot;bridge&quot; man, which he defines as a man who thinks much like a woman.  If you're a woman wanting to have your stereotypes reinforced, this is the book for you.

The latest Potter novel continues the magical story of a boy growing up in a society of witches and wizards.  The biggest complaint that I have is that it is too long, if that is possible.  At 870 pages the weight of the book makes it hard to hold up while reading.  And while all of the sidebar adventures were interesting it kind of dragged in the middle.  The main plot elements of Harry's conflict with the Dark Lord was not advanced very far.  The scene near the end with the magical combat between Dumbledore's Army and the Death Eaters went on too long.  I got the impression that she is writing that scene more as a movie script than for a novel.  On the positive side Rowling doesn't shy away from inclusion of dark aspects in her \\"children's\\" books.  One of Harry's friends dies (or does he?).  Characters are rarely all good or all bad.  Fudge from the Ministry of Magic is a villain despite being in charge of protecting people, perhaps an education for teenage readers about how real governments are so often wrong about most everything.

Fisher begins by claiming that \\"It (Wicca) is a modern religion attempting to reinvent the spirit, the ideal of ancient Goddess worship without many of the downfalls.\\" (Introduction, page 19)  She continues to describe Wicca as Goddess worship and to liberally scatter common feminist misandry throughout the book.  It soon becomes apparent that the \\"downfalls\\" she alludes to from \\"ancient Goddess worship\\" are the part where the ancient Goddess loved and honored Gods and men as well as women.  \\"Wicca...is indeed a Goddess tradition.,\\" page 32.  The entire Chapter 3 is on the \\"Immanence of the Goddess.\\"  Although she mentions the God in passing once in a while, it is very limited and strictly second fiddle, when she isn't describing men with contempt. In the chapter on \\"Sexuality, Sacred Sex, and Gender Roles,\\" we find \\"...sex is a unique celebration of the Goddess.\\" (p-186) A page later she's talking about \\"the plague of pedophilia, rape, and incest.\\"  In contrast to Fisher's feminist Goddess only view, a Wiccan web site that says, \\"those beliefs are not a part of Wicca. Wicca is about balance and equality. Between God and Goddess there is no superior and inferior, and we are in need of both.\\" Fisher's Chapter 5 is on \\"Balance,\\" but duality is confused with polarity.  Duality is inherently monotheistic, and throughout her chapter on Balance she talks almost exclusively about the Goddess.  Wicca, on the other hand is about polarity, complementary attraction, and harmony, not countervailing forces each trying to fly apart.  God and Goddess are equal, in balance and harmony in Wicca.  From the web site, \\"Wicca is about equality and balance. Men and women are exactly equal before the God and Goddess.\\"  When God is forgotten or disregarded, when men are repeatedly bashed, the philosophy is not very Wiccan at all.<br />Wicca is not a Goddess religion, nor a God religion.  Wicca is a religion of balance and harmony between Goddess and God, between men and women.  Neither is above the other, and criticism of one by the other is out of harmony and contradictory to the philosophy of Wicca.

They go into detail on how a badly flawed political training program masquerading as \\"studies\\" is now being promoted and taught at virtually every college.  Instead of education, young women get dogma.  Instead of intellectual challenges, young feminists are taught to accept the party line without question.  The authors include reviews of government agency promotion of the dis-education now accepted on college campuses.  Where \\"knowing\\" replaces scholarship, where victimology replaces competency, where hate replaces wisdom, that is today's \\"Women's Studies\\" program.  Title IX is mentioned in passing, but the question of an equal education required by law is not asked.  With over 700 colleges in the US now funding misandrist propaganda classes called \\"Women's Studies\\" why aren't any of them required to also teach equivalent classes for men under Title IX?  Even as bad as Women's Studies comes off in this book there is other, and perhaps equally valid and more damning criticism left out. <br />The book needs to be widely read by every college administrator and by every legislator who has to vote on college budgets.

The Triumph of the Moon, by Hutton,<br />Hutton is a British historian who has spent 10 years or so researching pagan history.  He recent book deals with the social and cultural forces that led to the emergence of Wicca in the middle of the 20th century.  He then chronicles the major trends in Wicca in the last half of the 20th century.  In one chapter he discusses the Starhawk/Budapest feminist California liberal misandrist turn that paganism took in the 1980s.  Hutton describes how their badly misandrist and overly emotional writing lacked any scholarly credibility, but nevertheless had a major impact of Wicca and paganism in general for two decades.  With publication of Hutton's book and others we are finally beginning to see some signs of returning to a more balanced pagan literature. <br />His history is incomplete however, and he makes some of the same mistakes and assertions that he criticizes others for making.  For example in the first half of the book Hutton extensively details literary references to witches and claims about historic roots. Many pages are each devoted to Margaret Murray and others.  Then toward the end he waives off all of that in a page or two by simply asserting that it has been disproved.  He provides nothing close to supporting data to demonstrate that claim.  A few years ago I attended a workshop by Dolores Ashcroft-Nowikci (21 books and other publications listed on Amazon) where she described in detail her study of an actual pagan village that kept itself hidden since the Norman invasion, and which had written records of village life since that time. According to Nowicki the village was finally over run by urban sprawl in 1990 but most of the residents have relocated to a new hidden village that still follows pre-christian pagan traditions.  Nowicki says that her mother was born in the pagan village.  Either Nowicki was lying to everyone who has attended her workshops describing the pagan village, or Hutton's scholarship that \\"disproved\\" the survival of actual pagan villages is sadly lacking.  I have also researched or become aware of several other pieces of information that leads me to believe 1) that some of the historical witch trials and hangings were in fact people whom modern pagans would recognize as pagan witches, and 2) that some family tradition witches were actually surviving pagan witches.  Hutton asserts that all claims to any pagan survival have been disproved, and in fact are not possible, but he offers no proof and provides no data.  A widely published author, Initiate Wiccan HPS, and leader of a Ceremonial Magick society in the UK such as Ashcroft-Nowicki cannot be waived off by assertion without some evidence that her claims are false.  My own family admitted to being witches at the Salem trials, but their stories have been deleted from current histories rather than researched and discounted.  You won't find their names on lists of witch trial victims published in the last half century.  Today's historians would rather claim that all the witch trial victims were really Christians.  That's not scholorship, that's just avoiding the disagreable facts. <br />On the positive side Hutton does provide a lot of information about Gardner and subsequent Wiccan history.  His observations about the state of Wicca today are interesting.  I was especially fascinated by the discussion trying to fit Wicca into anyone's scholarly classification system for religions and religious branches.  Wicca, it seems, doesn't fit any classification system and religious scholars don't know what even to call it.  I would recommend the book to all Wiccans and interested parties, but keep in mind that it's not the last word on a lack of pagan roots.	2003-05-14

He documents and discusses Gerald Gardner's creation of Wicca in the 1950s.  The contributions of several other people are also credited.  The one drawback is that he blurs all his data to support his premise that Gardner (and friends) invented the Wicca as a whole new religion.  Kelly hypothesizes that Gardner, Dorothy Clutterbuck, and some other friends formed their first coven in 1939 as a new creation.  He insists that there was no prior witchcraft from which they drew workings, beliefs, morality or rituals.  Every part of Gardnerian Wicca documents that do not appear to have come from an identifiable source he credits to Gardner himself.  Overlooks the fact that there was a witch museum before Gardner took it over.  The reader may be tempted to ask, if Gardner invented it all what was in the museum before Gardner?  Kelly stretches logic to deny possible connections to prior magical or pagan sources.  If you want a book on the development and progression of Gardnerian Wicca during the 1950s, this is a good source.  If you're looking for hard evidence about Gardner's sources and prior connections this is probably not your book.	2003-04-30

Mithraism celebrated its mysteries in caves and caverns beneath the ground, a representation of entering the underworld of the soul.  <br />Mithraism is a \\"mystery cult.\\"  Its religious teachings were mysteries, journeys through the underworld of the soul.  David Ulansey interprets the symbols on Mithraic art, and proposes a theory on the origin of the Mithraic religion.  The most common Mithraic art is the \\"tauroctony\\" which is a picture of Mithras slaying a bull beneath astrological symbols.  Ulansey proposes that Mithraism originated in Tarsus during the first century BCE.  He theorizes that Mithras is the constellation Perseus, seen above the constellation Taurus, and portrayed as slayer of Taurus.  He theorizes that the astronomical discovery of the precession of the calendar through the astronomical signs caused a major religious upheaval in lands where Gods were astrological.  He theorizes that the Stoic philosophers and religious leaders in Tarsus, a city in Asia Minor, created the Mithraic religion because of this new scientific revelation.  The spring equinox at that time was coming out of Aries and moving into Pisces.  Two thousand years later it is now moving out of Pieces into Aquarius, the so-called age of Aquarius.  Ulansey theorizes that the Stoic philosophers in Tarsus, using the new scientific of the precession of the solar rotation, calculated backward more than two thousand years to an age of Taurus, and based the Mithraic religion on the end of the age of Taurus, supposedly envisioned as Perseus slaying Taurus.  The new religion was then supposedly picked up by Clinician pirates and spread throughout the Roman Empire. <br />Ulansey's analysis leaves a lot out and raises more questions than he answers.  The first question that comes to mind is why the name Mithra instead of Perseus?  He suggests that the name comes from the King of Tarsus who was named for Mithra, an Iranian God. He suggests that since the images of Perseus and Apollo were both often seen on Cilicean coinage in similar images, it was obvious to call God by the name of the King, Mithra. The reader may be left wondering where this leap of logic happened.  Also left out entirely is any explanation or theory about the involvement of the Iranian God Mithra, whose worship predates Roman Mithraism by at least several centuries, and for whom the succession of Kings of Tarsus was named.  It seems unlikely that Mithraism doesn't have roots in an earlier version, as evidenced by the previous succession of Kings of Tarsus. I was left wondering.  <br />But the biggest thing left out of the book is the \\"Mithraic Mysteries\\" the subject promised by the title.  Not addressed, described, or even mentioned is the secret religious rituals, celebrations or initiations of the mystery cult.  It may be that nobody knows what they were, similar to the lost Eleusinian mysteries, but if they are unknown why are we promised an explanation of their origins in the title?  On the whole I was disappointed, not because the author's explanation was lacking, but because I read through to the end and the subject of the Mithraic Mysteries had not even been mentioned.	2003-02-21

Unfortunately he rapidly gets bogged down into Freudian psychobabble that makes us wonder if he's writing from the iron mines on Uranus.

He invents a household maid robot from commonly available parts. Here we are fifty years later and engineers still haven't figured that one out. Seriously underestimated are the computer sensors, controls and programs that are required for such a machine. I suppose he ought to be given credit for being aware of the possibilities of computer controls in the 1950s when computers were huge vacuum tube devices. Transistors hadn't yet been invented, or at least not well known. He didn't foresee the end of tubes. His computer memory was built of hypothesized on memory tubes.  Oh well.  Despite his depiction of electronically controlled robots, his far future engineers still used slide rules, forgetting that calculation is one of the easiest things for a computer to do, far easier than controlling a robot or drawing a plan.  <br />His characters were pretty much one dimension.  Heinlein never did learn to be very good at characters even years later.  The plot is interesting for all the techo geeks.  He gets swindled out of his company by an evil woman and deposited in 30-year time suspension \\"long sleep.\\"  She looks him up later though she's now old and he's still young. I got a laugh at the vision of 2001, the year he returns to life.  Many things have changed but in ways he didn't imagine. We do have lots of computers, but no robot maids, nor FTL space travel, nor time travel.  There never was W.W. III, for example. The business swindles are hard to follow.

It comes at a time when there is a resurgent desire to find the old traditions among what Grimassi describes as \\"neo-Wicca.\\"  His downfall is that he bases much of his description of Wiccan and cultural history on the feminist fantasy of a peacful prehistoric matriarchal Goddess culture.  If it had been mentioned once in passing, a variance from recognized archeology into wishful fantasy wouldn't be a big problem, but it recurs again and again throughout the book.  The myth of a peaceful matriarchy later replaced by a dominator patriarchy is misandrist nonsense that has no valid place in traditional Wicca. Wicca isn't about sexual prejudice. I would prefer accuracy to prejudicial revisionism. <br />Another downfall occurs in chapter 1 where Grimassi describes the history of modern Wicca from Gardner to the current division between traditional Craft and eclectic neo-Wicca.  Left out entirely in his modern history is the huge impact that occurred in the 1970s and 1980s when feminist Goddess witches in very large numbers came into contact with Traditional Wicca.  Their Goddess dominant theologies and eclectic teachings were in conflict with the teachings of traditional (Gardnerian, etc.) covens.  One can hardly comprehend how Wicca in the US went from Gardnerian covens to neo-Wicca without talking about the overwhelming number of Goddess oriented feminists who came into witchcraft without the coven teachings or the traditional beliefs during those years, and by force of numbers had a profound influence on everyone involved.  Perhaps this is left out because Grimassi still seems to be under the influence of the mythos added to Wicca by these groups.  His description of the roles of the Priestess and Priest in a coven, chapter 10, relegate the Priest to what Buckland once called, \\"a glorified alter boy.\\"  Traditional Wicca, it needs to be remembered, was profoundly influenced by Gerald Gardner, who was anything but an altar boy.  <br />Even when describing Men's Mysteries, chapter 15, he says, \\"The men's mysteries rose out of the matrifocal cult of the Neolithic period.\\" Nonsense! There never was a widespread matrifocal cult in the Neolithic period except in the fantasy land of modern feminist revisionists.  Men have always been leaders and teachers of our people and our ancestors' people. The men's mysteries need not be filtered through some imaginary female sieve before being claimed as divine male power.  <br />If one overlooks the many obvious instances of revisionist historic fantasy and puts a lot of salt on anything related to historical reference, there are several parts that fairly well describe modern Wiccan belief and practice.  Rituals, ethics, morals, beliefs, magick, and so forth are accurately portrayed.	2003-01-21

He traveled around finding and documenting folkways of minority groups, Gypsies, for example. While on travel in Italy he met an old woman who told him tales of witchcraft and gave him some of their words. Aradia is a short little book containing translations of the words that Leland got from the old woman.  It contains the oldest known version of what pagans now call \\"The Charge of the Goddess,\\" although it was not called that in this book.  It also advises witches to be naked in their rites, and after the feast is over to make love in the darkness. <br />First published in 1890, Aradia is must reading for anyone who is studying pagan or Wiccan traditions.

He hypothesizes a class in \\"History and Moral Philosophy\\" taught by a former Colonel who retired from the military after losing some body parts.  Much of the book deals with the moral philosophy that might be taught in such a class.  Citizenship, and voting, is limited to those who have volunteered for and completed government service.  Probably half the book is the story of a young man's career in the Mobile Infantry.  The other half is moral philosophizing.  Heinlein has always been two steps ahead of the rest of the crowd on morals and philosophy as well as being out front of technology.  Do humans have a right to conquer space and take it from other species?  Should people who won't volunteer to do government service have a right to vote for government leaders? Can government be codified into established scientific principals?  Should generals be required to lead their troops into battle as even kings once did?  The moral questions addressed are many and diverse.  I have always enjoyed Heinlein's moral attitude, freedom is fundamental, not government control.<br />There are no women to speak of in the book. There are no female troopers.  Unlike later Heinlein novels that have lots of flagrant sexuality you'll find none here. Aboard ship there are armed guards posted at the separation between women's quarters and the men's quarters. Even when the troopers go to a \\"district\\" for R&R he says nothing of what they do there.  It's still the one-dimensional women typical of 1950s sci-fi genera. Despite half a book of moral philosophy, none of it deals with male/female relationships.<br />I read it first forty years ago and re-read it again now.  Unlike the recent movie where the troopers went against the \\"bugs\\" with ineffective guns that had to shoot each one a hundred times before it was killed, Heinlein's troopers were well armed with deadly weapons.  \\"Shoulder to shoulder\\" was 300 yards apart killing everything between with \\"flamers\\" and hand held explosive projectiles.  The bugs fought back with weapons too, also unlike the movie.  Almost 50 years after it was written there is very little that is technologically wrong. Perhaps he underestimated the speed of computers recalculating courses, which would take less computing than running the trooper suits, but most of it still reads like plausible future tech.<br />I wonder at the $.. price shown.

It copies the movie, and has all the flaws.  The troopers in the movie had no guns.  We're expected to believe that they flew starships and the best personal weapon they could find was an automatic rifle hardly better than 20th century. They had no guns.  Even a battery of civil war field pieces would have been a major improvement.  A Sherman tank would have been a miracle.  Given the starship technology a viewer/reader would expect them to carry real guns that fire real destruction, not those puny ineffective popguns they died holding.  The lack of credible weapons makes these troopers seem like ineffective jerks and destroys the credibility of the whole thing. <br />Heinlein's troopers wore armored suits and carried weapons sufficient to destroy everything alive within several hundred yards.  They had to pay attention when they got within half a mile of each other so they wouldn't wipe each other out. Not these fools, they have to fire a hundred rounds to kill one unarmed bug. Pathetic and unbelievable.<br />The original Starship Troopers spends half the book discussion moral philosophy of government, command structure of troops, and the morals of space exploration. This has none of that.  What a waste.	2003-01-21
US	49910606	RBTDG35ADLO2I	0671552864	263433244	Circles of Stone	Books	3	4	6	N	N	Women good, men bad.	The book is a feminist fiction that uses badly distorted prehistory to explain *why* all men are bad.  A major part of the three plots is women's deception of men about fatherhood.  One of the Zena characters supposedly learns that females get pregnant after mating with males by watching animals, but keeps it secret because giving such knowledge to men would destroy emerging human development.  It's a preposterous feminist myth from the beginning, even the female animal seemed to know how to make a baby, but somehow the reader is supposed to presume that early human women did not, and men didn't either.  The book describes a hypothetical million years of lying and deception by women toward men in fictional women's Goddess society.  Eventually the lying and deception catches up with them when men discover how they have been deceived all those thousand millennia.  The men are understandably angry. Evil men reject the whole dishonest feminist utopian society they have labored under for so long, bringing death and destruction to a land where female utopian peace and balance with nature always reigned.  <br />On the brighter side, in the first section of the book the author paints a vivid picture of how some parts of life were lived during the time when pre-human ancestors were developing in the Great Rift Valley in Africa.  The later section about prehistoric culture in what is now France was not very well portrayed.  Several important parts were mixed up such as ice rapidly forming to the north and driving people south while the climate underwent big changes.  And of course the Goddess culture, called \\"Mother,\\" is represented throughout the book without any corresponding God imagery, a feminist revisionist of history.  It's an enjoyable story in parts, if you can overlook the many inaccuracies and prejudices.	2003-01-13

Rather than a manifesto, Levison leads us on a sometimes humerous recount of a loser going from one low wage job to the next.  He wants us to believe that his misfortune is the fault of greedy lying employers, but at every turn he's his own worst enemy.  In the first job he describes lying about experience to get a job in the fish market of an upscale grocery.  His first day on the job he violates the dress standards of the employer.  Within weeks he's routinely stealing food and other products, and focusing more on his smoke breaks than the flow of customers at the fish counter.  He blames the manager for firing him.  He gets a job as a restaurant cook in a rapidly expanding chain.  When they recognize his ability and degree and want him to move up the corporate ladder he doesn't like the responsibility and quits.  Much of the book is about the Alaska fishing industry where he works for a few weeks rather than for a season. In a few weeks on a fish processing ship he gets into fights, carries a gun in a drug deal, and gets sentenced for driving without a license.  He probably makes a good move getting out of fish processing and onto a boat, but quits after a few more weeks.  He says he's had 42 different dead end jobs since graduating with a degree in English, and with his attitude its no wonder.  There are Alaska fishermen who saved money from a season or two and bought their own boat, or opened a boat building shop in the off season.  But Levison makes a few bucks and flies home to blow it all before being broke again and finding his next dead end job.  It's probably a realistic picture of the dead end people who work dead end jobs.  Its not a manifesto or call to arms of any political nature.	2002-11-10

What once lasted a lifetime now comes and goes so fast that few men are lucky enough to raise their children.  Long before most children grow up the average American wife files for divorce, takes the house, the car, the bank account, the kids, and leaves the man in a state of indentured servitude not unlike a form of slavery.  Author Jed Abraham provides a divorce lawyer's perspective on what happens to today's man after he marries and starts a family.  Some practical advice, other than not marrying under today's sham laws, includes guidance for pre-nuptial agreements and other precautions for the man who must marry.  A large flaw is that he, being a lawyer, absolves lawyers and judges from blame.  Jed blames \\"the law,\\" not those who practice the law.  I find that to be morally ridiculous, because its divorce lawyers and judges who use the law to destroy so many million men and children.   A great portion of blame rests right at their doorstep.  Left out too are other courtroom disasters that now plague men such as the radical new crime called \\"spousal rape,\\" MANdatory arrest laws for frequently fictitious domestic violence complaints even when the man complained about the woman's violence, and the persecution of men for phony child abuse complaints.  <br />Jed does offer suggested changes in divorce law that would greatly help young men.  The future is really grim if something isn?t done, and done soon.  It's a must read for every man thinking about marriage.  It's a must read for every women wondering why men \\"won't commit.\\" It's a must read for every elected state representative and Congressman.

I'm sure it will be well received by pseudo intellectual feminists wanting affirmation of their own misandrist prejudice, but anyone else would be wasting their time.  In a footnote to the prelude the author thanks \\"especially women\\" for providing him with information about dominant men.  He extensively cites folk customs of a particular subdivision of Algerian people and extrapolates that into a general condemnation of men and western society in general. On every page are unsupported misandrist assertions and prejudicial rhetoric.  It reads like a poorly written parody of a KKK lecture on relations between blacks and whites, except its about men and women, and he's serious.  The author beats around the bushes filling the book with page after page of common feminist hate propaganda, and then finally gets around to his real message in the Appendix, which is about \\"the gay and lesbian movement.\\"  Not that he hasn't used a lot previous references to gay sexual domination though, it's in every chapter.  Apparently a gay author, he finally reveals why he has no experience or understanding of normal relationships between men and women, and why he's willing to publish anti-male dogma that promotes disharmony between women and men.

Phyllis's second book at least admits that there are men in Wicca, a big improvement over her first book. However, she still has a way to go before admitting that men in Wicca are acceptable. She admits that men are there BUT says men must change, which is another way of saying that men are not okay, which is another way of expressing deeply held misandrism. Sexist prejudice is an unfortumate inclusion in a book about Wicca, a religion that usually rejects sexism and other kinds of prejudice, and I expected better from Phyllis. Men such as Gardner, Sanders, Buckland, Fitch and others have always been among the leaders of Wicca, and probably always will be. Its a shame that Curott can't seem to write a Wiccan book that accept the male half of Wicca. Men do not need to change to be acceptable.<br />Other than her continuation of sexist theology, the rest of the book is pretty good. It does include recent political positions on history, accepting claims of recent revisionists.

The author continually uses loaded male-bashing language to describe men and male bodies. Straight men talk about \\"men,\\" not \\"heterosexual men.\\" He quotes feminist women as experts on how men feel about being soldiers, as if a woman who has never been a man or a soldier or in a war has any clue what she's talking about. He cites all the usual radical feminist male bashers as authorities on men's behavior, feelings, and language. It's openly an attempt to undermine straight men and, the author hopes, to begin to prevent male bonding. Its a negative bash of men from cover to cover. His purpose is to undermine men.
