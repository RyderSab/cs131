I read the book since I didn't have a general  understanding of the Soviet Union under Stalin, and now I feel I have a  good grasp of what went on, both on the Leninist/Stalinist organizational  level, and on the personal level of not only Stalin, but many of those who  were liquidated.<br />If the book was originally written in Russian, this is  then a very good translation: easy to read and no clumsy expressions. I had  a hard time putting it down. As far as content, I feel I \\"learned\\" a  lot,  not just about the personality of Stalin, but also that of Lenin, Lenin's  wife, Trotsky, Motolov, Stalin's wives, his children, and others, all very  surprising, intimate and interesting stuff.<br />An excellent, smooth flowing  account about people and their character. I give it a strong five star  rating.	1999-11-26

Once the war  was finished, what were the consequences to the people, the military, the  concentration camp prisoners, and, most importantly, the politicians,  especially Truman, Roosevelt, and Stalin who receive excellent coverage in  this book. Some good surprises come to light...<br />I give the book five  stars for its analysis of the European civilian, military and political  situations in the aftermath of surrender.. With regard to the portion of  the book covering Japan, instead of describing the Japanese occupation in  detail, which I had been expecting, Weintraub spends far too much time on  the atomic bomb and political infighting in Japan prior to surrender, both  of which are covered far better by Richard Rhodes in \\"The Making of the  Atomic Bomb\\" and in \\"Japan's Longest Day\\" published by the Pacific War  Research Society (Kodansha International).<br />Still, quite good reading.	1999-11-15

At first glance, it appears the book is to be about dreadnoughts and maybe even some of the battles they fought in. But no, it's about, on one hand, the royalty of Europe and how they didn't get  along, and, on the other hand, the British parliamentarians, and how they  too didn't get along. <br />The closest the reader gets to getting aboard a  ship is when the Kaiser or some other member of a royal family climbs into  his royal yacht. Except, every now and then someone would talk about  Germany not needing so many dreadnoughts, and Britain complaining about the  cost of meeting ship-for-ship such expensive competition. <br />The book is  excellent for several reasons: (1) it is very well written, (2) it holds  your interest in an almost spellbinding manner , and (3) it provides a very  clear understanding of what Europe was like from about 1890 to about 1910.  It was nothing like it is now, neither politically nor boundary-wise. To us  now, it was almost like life on a different planet. <br />To the reader  interested in World War I or II, this is essential reading, almost a  prerequisite, since the author creates a very clear picture with  personalities and events and especially the way of thinking back then, of  an antiquated Europe that had as its future, an inevitable bloody path into  the modern world. <br />The World Wars don't make sense unless you understand  the root causes that this book narrates.	1999-11-12

However, the coverage is very broad, rating a five star for  those wishing to obtain an understanding of the Navy's role in World War  II, but rating about a 2 or 3 star for serious students of the war.<br />There  are a number of excellent points to be made about the book: (1) it is easy  to read; (2) Morison talks \\"Navy talk\\" without apology (so get out your  dictionary at times); (3) maps are generally there when you need them,  although more camnpaign maps would be appreciated; (4) Morison speaks with  authority on the subject since he was really there; and (5) a nice touch:  an evaluation, in the last chapter, of the U.S. Navy commanders who had a  say so in how the war went.<br />This is a very fine book for the general  reader and those specialists wishing to get back to the \\"broad picture\\" or  string of events. For the student of the war, the book lacks depth in  specific events, and this is certainly excusable since volumes have been  written on specific events, such as Okinawa, Tarara, Overlord, the sinking  of the Yamato, and so on.	1999-10-25

Massie's \\"Dreadnought, Britain, Germany, and the Coming of the Great War\\" which  seems to just stop after England declares war on Germany in August  1914.<br />Gilbert gives us a brief introduction to the war (not as good an  introduction as Massie's, but adequate), and covers the various campaigns  of the war in detail, enough so that the reader has a very good  understanding of the different forces affecting those soldiers at war and  those civilians and politicians back  home.<br />The author keeps the war on a  \\"personal\\" level, treating us to mini-biographies of some of the players,  and then, pages later, describing how they were killed. Apparently there  were quite a few poets in the English army since every now and then,  Gilbert quotes from them, especially the ones who get killed. And there are  many of them, since this is mostly deadly trench warefare.<br />Gilbert keeps  to realistic detail which helps us read his book not as a history but an  account of the war and those who fought it and what they actually went  through. For this and for the fact that he keeps the reader alerted to the  overall military and political \\"big picture\\" I have to give him five stars.  <br />The book is a complete and interesting picture of the war for the  general reader. I enjoyed reading it and felt I now have a better  understanding of how European life and attitudes were so diferent back  then, and how the boundaries of Europe had to end up where they are today.	1999-10-25

It is more an autobiography than a narration about the Black Sheep squadron. However, I  rate it five stars because it delivers what I was looking for, an excellent  narration of Boyington's internment in a Japanese internment  camp.<br />Reading the book, it appears Boyington wrote it himself without the  help of a ghost writer or editor, and it shows. It rambles at times,  meditates, confuses, dwells on his drinking problems... But overall,  Boyington delivers the goods: (1) a pre-war background; (2) his work in  China; (3) the Black Sheep aviators; (4) his being shot down by the  Japanese; (5) his internment; and (6) after the war.<br />Boyington, the  author, treats us to the use of  \\"tough guy\\" 1940-1945 words and  expressions, which is refreshing, and he goes into detail on some events  which could have been left out but which, nevertheless, are very  interesting (traveling as a missionary, adventures ashore, etc.) and give  the book a special touch.<br />His capture by the Japanese was what I was  after, and I was well satisfied. Boyington goes into great detail and, by  his method of writing, makes the reader feel you could actually see him  sitting there begging sake from the Japanese guards while he worked in the  kitchen preparing for one of their celebrations.<br />A nice book, better  written by Boyington than by a ghost writer. It captures the essence of the  moment.	1999-10-25

Reading Shreeve's book is like listening to a PBS nature program on TV and not watching it. You hear interviews of famous anthropologists and then  scenes of students digging at Neandertal sites or currators showing types  of skulls to the author.<br />Shreeve does not \\"tell us\\" what to believe; his  process is to \\"reveal\\" opposing thoughts and somehow let us decide for  ourselves. The author lets the story revolve around two subjects that I,  the reader, was really interested in: (1) who the heck were the Neandertals  and did they die out, or did they mix in with the Cro-Magnon people; and  (2) is there anything to the Eve hypothesis, and when did this lady start  us.<br />The author generally lets you hear one side of the story, then the  other on the Neandertals and on Eve. As he progresses it all begins to seem  clearer and clearer, and actually quite interesting. The impression I  received, as a reader, was, yes, there were Neandertals and they died out  and did not mix in in any permanent way with the Cro-Magnons; and, yes,  there is an Eve somewhere out there and she is not that far off in  time.<br />The way Shreeve writes certainly keeps the readers interest and  attention, even though he deliberately lets one scientist influence the  reader one way and then another scientist turn the reader another way. It  is like a book of discovery which makes the reader think and not just  read.<br />I enjoyed reading this book, and may reread it again later to see  if I missed something!	1999-10-25

The book  is very readable and helps provide a clearer understanding of that piece of  history from the attack on Soviet territory to the Soviets entering Berlin  as Hitler took his life. Therefore the 5 stars.<br />Although Alan Clark  presents his reasoning for what he chose to report on, I, the reader, still  felt a little left out. - I expected more of Moscow, on the one hand, and  more analysis on the Russian political picture towards the end, on the  other.  In some cases, Clark would lead us somewhere, but then not follow  through. Thus the 3 stars.<br />Overall, however, this book is must reading to  the World War II scholar. In keeping with where Clark leads us (to  Stalingrad and Soviet commandos' street fighting), I would recommend  reading Commandos from the Sea : Soviet Naval Spetsnaz in World War II  (Naval Institute Special Warfare Series) by Iurii Strekhnin, et al - For a  broader view of where Clark takes us in his detailed \\"Barbarossa\\" analysis,  I would strongly suggest the reader pick up a copy of Why the Allies Won by  Richard Overy.	1999-08-12

For example, he feels it may  have been possible for the Russians alone to defeat the Germans. Or, if  England were defeated early in the war, we in the U.S. might have had to  live with the situation of a Nazi German Europe. And, did we win through  Hitler's mistakes, or did we win by the economy of war goods America  produced in great quantities?<br />Overy gives credit where it is due,  contrary to any current political correctness. He gives credit to the  Russians and explains in detail why - he gives credit to the effectiveness  of Hitler's leadership, or generalship, and he carefully explains that also  - and, he introduces a lot of  generally-ignored \\"what if\\" questions that  cause the reader to think.<br />According to Overy, the Second World War was a  complex string of events and human considerations. If it had not proceeded  exactly the way it did, and events occur as they luckily did in some cases,  we would now be looking at a different \\"new world order.\\"<br />Excellent  analysis, interwoven with some imagistic action from time to time to keep  the reader on his/her toes.

This is a very exciting book with a very realistic, and certainly not boring, account of a boat semi-adrift for about a month without water and without food in the South Atlantic Ocean. This is a very true World War II  story, with the Doggerbank being a German supply ship (blockade runner)  returning from Japan and bound for German-occupied France with its precious  cargo, and the ship being sunk mistakenly by a German submarine before it  reached its assigned port.<br />The book is a translation, so you can expect  some of that clumsiness that occurs in such instances; however I was  impressed how well the story came through in English -- during the early  part of the book the reader could almost smell the diesel fumes from the  old German ships as well as the sauerkraut that the German chef was famous  for cooking down in the ship's galley.<br />The book is divided into three  parts: (1) how the sole survivor of the Doggerbank managed to finagle his  way aboard the ship; (2) the second part is very suspenseful as the  Doggerbank passes through a school of u-boats; and (3) the third part is  the very best account of how people behave and hold up during a shipwreck  (and I've read Nordoff and Hall and The Old Man and the Sea )...<br />Overall  the book is easy reading, exciting, and revealing to the reader.  It holds  the reader's interest to the point the reader wants to finish the entire  book in one session. (It took me two...)  A five star book by anybody's  accounting.	1999-07-13

If you were expecting an exciting, hold-your-breath account of British spies doing dangerous and crazy things and commando frogmen sneaking up enemy rivers and blowing up German ships, you are in for quite a  disappointment.  This book is simply a long-winded description of the  organizational structure and strategic planning and strategy of British  deception intelligence agencies during the war with Germany.<br />But, to be  honest, the book does what it proposes to do: tell the story of British  deception practices from an organizational standpoint, all of which is very  boring to the average reader looking for spy adventure, but perhaps quite  valuable to a serious student of World War II or a person who themselves  participated in the British deception practices since the book mentions  every possible name, committee, group, office, MI5, MI6, Sir this, Sir  that, people such as Lt. Col.  Strangeways, Major General Sir Frederick  Morgan, etc.  involved in the effort . (Very dry stuff, I dare say...) On top  of that, on every page occurs the word notional or notionally, which is  very strange usage of English to an American reader, as is the use of  the  word Schwerpunkt, used occasionally.  <br />Overall - for the average reader  this is a TWO STAR book - there is some very interesting information in  this book which will expand your knowledge of World War II deception  practices by our friends the Brits; however, I found myself skipping a  paragraph here and there, and then a page or two,  and several times my  eyes glazed over. But, for the professional researcher, this is a FIVE STAR  BOOK containing a lot of basic information about the spy business. What  worked and what didn't, and why. How is strategy developed, coordinated,  implemented. Can it come back and bite you? How do you confirm the  effectiveness of your deception efforts. And so on. I should think it would  be a required reading (text) for a course given by the CIA or NSA.	1999-07-06

This is a pretty good book. The author, William Breuer, does a fine job in creating a story that encompasses both the technical and the human sides of the Allied invasion of the French Riviera just after the Allied Normandy  invasion of the western coast of France. Breuer also creates just enough  background as to where we are in the campaign's action, and then fills in  those scenarios with human figures, both American, German, and French  Resistance.<br />The book has several phases, all of which are well done. The  first is the preparation for the invasion by the Allies and all the  problems that went along with it, plus the concern by the German Generals  that an attack was likely. The second portion deals with the airborne  troops landing in the dead of night, and the adventures that went along  with such a risky undertaking. This portion is perhaps the most interesting  and installs in the reader some of that Walter Middy feeling.<br />The author  then goes on with the landing of the gliders, the beachhead  bombings,  attacking the beaches by assault troops, and continues on until the  campaign is considered a success by the Allied forces. <br />Although the book  is comprehensive, it is not boring reading  but rather some very positive  reporting. What is exceptional about the book is that the author has  written it from the serviceman's level rather than from the general's  level. The author therefore presents us with a lot of answers that we, as  lowly privates and corporals want to know.: how G.I.'s got hurt jumping out  of airplanes; what Axis Sally told the troops on the radio; how the Germans  acted; how the French Resistance acted; how two soldiers walked up to a  hospital in German territory and banged on the door, and then, discovering  their mistake when a German opened the door, bluffed and demanded that the  Germans surrender or their invisible Allied force surrounding the building  would fire on them. The bluff worked!<br />Very enjoyable reading. Provides a  thorough understanding of the southern France invasion.	1999-07-02

It is well written with both action and information in mind.  The action  standpoint is superb and makes the reader wonder how Capt Werner and his  crew ever survived the punishment they took in their little fragile  &quot;egg&quot; as aircraft and ships constantly dropped bombs and depth  charges on them.  From the information standpoint, Werner gives us a very  comprehensive and interesting description of what it is like inside the  early u-boats. It is hard to imagine how the crew lived like they did in  their constantly rocking boat: without bathing for months, eating moldy  food, suffering from constant humidity, freezing or roasting as the season  might be (no airconditioning or heaters), and not having proper sanitary  conditions (using a bucket in rough seas, etc.) Very good detail on u-boat  life both aboard ship and in port.  From another information standpoint,  Werner gives us a good description of what average Germans were thinking as  the war progressed, what sort of damage ordinary citizens were taking as  the war proceeded in depth over Germany both from the heavy air bombardment  plus the advancement of Allied armies from the south, east, and north.   Werner is also a &quot;ladies man&quot; so we do hear a lot about the  girlfriends in every port, so to speak, plus German submariners' night life  in different occupied locations. (They seemed to like France a lot.)  It is  good that Werner provides you this gamut of information: living inside the  boat, dealing with the difficult navy bureaucracy, joys of in-port liberty,  his nice but unfortunte family, the Nazi party bother, and so on since it  furnishes the reader with a rounded out picture of life during these  unusual times.  Werner is lucky to have come back alive, and we are  fortunate he wrote this book. His family and many of his friends were not  so fortunate as the reader will see.	1999-07-02

If you can get by some of the European-style bravado and the Communist titles, such as Hero of the  Army, and that sort of thing, the book is worth reading and provides  valuable insight into the work of these people.<br />Essentially, this book  covers the Soviet commandos (all sailors) on the Danube River in areas  largely occupied by the retreating Germans and in the Crimea area during  the time the Germans held control there.<br />The book is broken up into short  &quot;adventures&quot; or missions, each of which is exciting enough to  keep the reader glued to the pages. Some of the missions are incredible but  yet believable since they do make sense. What these commandos do, or did,  is somewhat like the work of U.S. Navy Seals.<br />The book is a translation,  so it does have a stilted tone to it; however, the narrations are so well  done descriptively, that you get the impression it must be a beautiful work  in Russian. And it probably is.<br />The book is easy reading, very revealing,  and exciting. The characters are very real and act in a Euro-macho manner,  making the reader chuckle at times at their naivete.	1999-06-28

This is an easy-to-read-and-understand history of the background of Naziism and how it led to the concentration camps and then to Auschwitz in particular. For readability and coverage, I have to give it five stars.  Once you read this book, containing plenty of good photos, and plenty of  documentation, you do have a pretty good understanding of what Auschwitz is  all about.<br />This book is a translation of the book &quot;Guide to the  Museum&quot; which is sold at Auschwitz. Since it is addressed to the  audience of Auschwitz museum-goers, it does have a good bit of that  political neutralism you find in institutional documentation as well as the  good look of a book you walk out of the museum with and show later to your  friends.<br />It is a little glossy chapbook of sorts, but well worth reading  to those not that familiar with the subject, or for those wishing to  refresh themselves of Auschwitz history in general.	1999-06-28

Where once the u-boat was invincible, each run becomes a 50/50  suicide run, worse odds that playing Russian roulette with a pistol.  <br />Blair notes that it took him 11 years to complete his research and write  this book, and it shows.  You could not ask for a more complete assessment  of u-boat activity during the war than Blair provides.  However, it's not  for the weak reader. Reading this book requires stamina, but the reader is  rewarded in the end with getting a very good &quot;feel&quot; for the  u-boat situation in general. It's almost as if Blair, by hammering in each  individual sailing, sinking, or abort, gets you to see the &quot;big  picture.&quot;<br />I like the author's interjection of ancillary material  from time to time: the possibility of losing Enigma decrypts; the land  invasion of Europe; where the boats went when the end of the war was  announced, and so on. I also like Blair's outspoken opinion on various  contemporary subjects such as the overbearing Brits, the vote-concerned  politicians, the &quot;unfair&quot; war crimes trials, and so  on.<br />Exceptional reading; the author knows his stuff.	1999-06-10

The author is not only meticulous in describing practically each u-boat sailing during this period, but he tends to keep the reader's interest in what could be a dull assignment, by  explaining pertinent background information and providing in-depth detail  on various crew members, making many of them &quot;come to life&quot; in  the words on the page. At the same time, he keeps the reader informed on  what is going on in other parts of the war that could affect u-boat and ASW  (anti-submarine warfare) operations and practices, such as code breaking,  Hitler's rash decision-making, Operation Torch, dropping off of secret  agents, sabateurs, and/or commandos into enemy territory, development of  radar and sonar and HF direction finding, u-boat activity on the U.S.  coast, military officials involved, etc. This book is important  historically since it not only provides an extremely detailed account of  operations, but it reviews it from an American standpoint based on the  author's incredible current research and his reading of British historians,  and then commenting on divergences of viewpoint or, in some cases, the lack  of British commentary on certain embarrassing happenings. - As some  reviewers have noted, Blair tends to &quot;stick with the facts&quot;  instead of sensationalising, and in the process gains the reader's trust.  Excellent u-boat history, engrossing reading.	1999-05-24

On the literary side, this book will put  you to sleep since reading Goldhagen is like reading a very long and boring  college psychology paper: it is not reader-friendly although there are  certain portions that I admired that I thought stood out quite well. - As  for Goldhagen's analysis of the feelings of the &quot;ordinary&quot;  Germans, his analysis is weak and spotty because his hypothesis is weak or  poorly stated or poorly chosen and his arguments appear &quot;forced&quot;  to agree with this limited hypothesis. - I feel the subject is very  important, but that the author disapointed me since he could have done a  better job.	1999-05-04

The author does a superb and comprehensive job in informing the reader of the status of medicine and Allied medical  organization during World War II. - I give the author five stars because  he: (1) described the contemporary diseases and medicines as well as types  of battle casualties; (2) narrates how the medics and field hospitals  followed the troops into battle; and (3) gives us a good understanding of  the development of military medical organization and the problems it had.  On top of that, Cowdry keeps interesting a subject that otherwise could be  boring, and, better yet, he starts at the beginning (Pearl Harbor) and  takes us right through the war to the final atomic bomb and how the medics  adapted and continued to do their stuff, including work on POW's. Good  imagery to keep the reader's attention. Covers all theaters. An excellent  background history, essential for students of WWII history.	1999-05-04

The author(s)apparently know what they are talking about with regard to the battle of the bulge. However, it is written in a pretty dry and boring manner, almost, like another reviewer stated, seeming  to be written as a college paper that is trying to get &quot;all the  facts&quot; in. The detail is terrific, and probably important, for the  military historian reader interested in what battalion was where, or what  company commander did what, or which army advanced here or there, or  withdrew so many miles, etc. But, for the general reader it is kind of  boring, although I thought the asides on the lives of the military officers  were somewhat interesting. Overall, not light reading, very little of that  imagery and word magic necessary to keep your eyeballs glued to the page.	1999-04-21

I had read quite a few books on the  Holocaust and wondered what happened after the war. Kaufman answers this  question clearly and to the point, and for this I give him five stars. - As  for the book's readability, as noted in previous reviews, the narrative  introduces us to several Jewish families in different East European  countries, and lets us &quot;follow them&quot; closely from the war's end  to after the Berlin Wall fell. The result is quite good and, at the same  time, very surprising and unexpected, at least to me; the characters are  alive and real and they and their histories will remain in the reader's  memory for some time. - Overall, I think Kaufman did an excellent job in  answering my question as to what happened to the European Jews after the  war. I was impressed.	1999-04-14

Capt. Waters, in this book published by the Naval Institute Press in  Annapolis, covers in great detail a number of the Allied North Atlantic  convoys which were under constant ferocious attack by German U-boat wolf  packs in 1942/1943, and which resulted in initial heavy losses of  American/British cargo ships, right on through 1943/1944 when the situation  was reversed and German U-boat losses rose to such a substantial level that  they were withdrawn from the area. Capt. Waters is quite thorough in  describing all facets of the struggle: how convoys were put together, how  they were to be protected by escorts, the shortage of escorts, the massive  sinking of cargo ships, frustration in watching ships go down, which  countries supplied what effort and so on. Capt. Waters provides interesting  accounts of sinkings, rescues, prisoners, storm damage, people, a number of  &quot;little things&quot; that keeps the account at a personal, exciting  and imagistic level. - This book is quite good and worth &quot;five  stars.&quot; In addition, Capt. Waters gives us several  &quot;freebies&quot; or appendices: one is on Ultra, another is on German  U-boat aces, another is on the weapons used, another is convoy protection  by aircraft. Highly recommended as fast moving, highly informative wartime  narrative.	1999-04-06

Do not expect more than that of this book. - As far as the maps,  they are very well done in that the top half of practically each page  contains a colorful map showing where each country's borders changed to and  where all the concentration camps were located; in addition major camps and  ghettos are detailed down to the street level and, in some cases, to the  building level. In other words, if you wanted an easy-to-read color-coded  street map of the Warsaw ghetto or the Lodz ghetto, you would find it here.  - As for the skimpy text, the text generally follows, or explains, the  beautiful maps on the top half of the pages. Only basic information is  provided: abbreviated situational/historic background, what area(s) the  camp served, what they did in each camp, how many people died in each one  of them, how many were Jews, Romas (Gypsies), Russians, Poles, and,  especially, how that camp fit into the general order of things at that  time. - A very nice book with heavy glossy pages, very detailed in a  statistical and often impersonal way, with maps, both general and detailed,  that you won't find anywhere else in one collection. - For someone who is  not at all familiar with the Holocaust or how it fit in with World War II  activity, or for even those who fail to believe the Holocaust actually  occured, this is probably the best volume to read before going into the  subject matter further.	1999-04-05

Books	5	2	2	N	N	GOOD BEHIND-THE-SCENES OF WORLD WAR II	I have to give the authors 5 stars for being consistent and meeting their goal of describing what went on &quot;behind the scenes&quot; during World War II, even though the title is a bit deceptive since it doesn't tell  &quot;dirty little secrets&quot; but rather provides interesting facts and  sidelights you don't see in history or narratives devoted to the war. One  of the previous reviewers said that this book was for the reader who had  already read about the war, or had good knowledge of it, and wanted to know  more about what went on behind the scenes, and that reviewer is quite  correct. It pays to have a good general knowledge about World War II since  the book doesn't cover events of the war (except for an appendix in the  back listing chronological events) but rather is full of &quot;little  stories&quot; in many cases supported by statistical tables. (Did you want  to know how many ships were sunk, how much money was spent, who had the  most casualties, etc? Tables keep you totally informed. Or did you want to  know how the Italian frogmen sunk British ships? Or did you want to know  about the German jet, or the Japanese rocket plane?) A lot of the book is  pure commentary, but it is very interesting. An excellent companion book,  for that is what it is.	1999-03-23

It is very comprehensive and provides you an excellent understanding of how the Pacific War graduated,  island-by-island, from Guadalcanal to Okinawa. It keeps everything in  perspective. The author writes in a very reader-friendly manner; maps are  good; and the Marine story is dealt with in a straightforward manner with  appropriate references to what other units (such as the Army and the Navy)  were doing while Marine action was occuring. The only problem I had was  &quot;what happened to Pappy Boyington?&quot; The author intersperses major  events with little interesting &quot;side stories,&quot; such as Boyington  shooting down Japanese planes, and later he being captured, and later  Boyington on Truk cussing and with the Japanese pilots threatening to kill  him. So what happened to Boyington? Otherwise an excellent and  comprehensive account, very readable and, like another reviewer states,  very re-readable.	1999-03-15

But  then I thought back about my shipboard days in the Navy in the Pacific, and  realized this book is a simply a collection of BS stories like we'd tell  each other late in the evening over coffee and cigarette smoke in the empty  mess hall. Some of those stories were spellbinding and convoluted as are  Manchester's, all somewhat necessary to keep the listener's rapt attention.  One of the previous reviewers complained about Manchester's  &quot;inconsistency&quot; but that is what late night mess hall  storytelling is all about. That's the characteristic background from whence  these &quot;inconsistent&quot; tales come. - (I'd have loved going on  liberty with this guy to see what kind of stories he came back with...)  Read it with patience and understanding.	1999-03-08

He provides a  division-by-division, batallion-by-batallion, company-by-company account of  the American forces as well as the same sort of detailed account of the  Japanese forces (the Japanese in italics, which is very helpful). This is a  well written military account and sticks to the subject. The author tends  to stay away from  individual G.I. stories, and creates instead within the  reader the feelings of the entire batallion, company, or other combat  group, American or  Japanese. When the author decides to stray from his  account, he tends to put little &quot;boxes&quot; off to the side with such  periferal information. Photos are good. Maps are adequate. As for being  biased against MacArthur, the author criticizes MacArthur, but does not  really criticize any more so than other contemporary military history  authors. Prefer answers the questions you may have had of the New Guinea  campaign. To be absolutely thorough, Prefer also provides an Orders of  Battle section in great depth. A good readable book and good reference  material.	1999-03-01

Cdr. Gallantin deserves five stars  not only for his account of battle but also for all the other contemporary  background information he provides about U.S. submarines in general, about  Navy personnel (both officers and enlisted men), about submarine customs,  about submarine tracking equipment, submariners' family life as well as  onboard life, and so on. For those readers interested in World War II  submarine action, this is a very good book, probably the best currently in  print. The only problem I had was the size of the book, which is one of  those economy pocketbooks which snaps shut on you if you loosen your grip,  and also makes you stretch the tight book open to read to the end of lines  on the left page; I would have much preferred reading it in a larger  format, say a softbound 6x9&quot; on quality paper. But, despite all this,  the Commander wrote a good story backed up by some post-war  analysis/information which fortunately is now declassified and available to  Gallantin and other World War II authors.	1999-02-22

The account is well  researched and clearly identifies numerous Marines, what they did, and what  happened to them.	1999-02-16

Overall, the account is very interesting and clearly written, with  much detail about the scenario as well as the Marine and Navy personnel  involved. The author brings the reader to the reef and the lagoon where the  landing Marines are being shot one after another in a seemingly fruitless  attempt to take this tiny little island. The account is well illustrated  with easy to read maps. This is important because the island being invaded,  Betio, is only one island in the Tarawa lagoon. If the reader is looking  for a professional, well-researched account of this invasion, this is  probably the one.	1999-02-16

Spurr presents an excellent and very readable account of the last sailing of the Yamato on it's suicide mission to Okinawa. The author switches back and  forth between the American side and the Japanese side, and, because of  this, presents two sides of the same event. And, when reading both sides,  the reader gets the impression that the author has done one heck of a job  of research. The American characters, and especially the Japanese  characters, come alive as real people, in real situations, in real action.  Spurr has done an excellent job in both research and presentation; the book  is exciting and hard to put down once you start reading. I was also  impressed with the clarity of maps and diagrams, which, in most books of  this period, are so small and blurry they are impossible to read. A great  battleship. A great story.	1999-02-08

The author very carefully  presents facts about the general and lets you the reader make up your mind  on where the truth lies. Manchester does not appear to &quot;take  sides&quot; in this book; he does not take the general and make him a god,  nor does he denigrate what the general has done. He presents the many sides  of this mysterious general and lets you, the reader, put it all together  which is not difficult, since Manchester provides you the tools to do it:  plenty of rich detail, plenty of quotes, excerpts of memos and messages,  much detail on his private family life. Again, Manchester does not tell the  reader what to think. For example, with the fall of the Philippnes, it  seems that the general has made up his mind to stay and, along with his  family, expects in a matter-of-fact way to commit suicide rather than be  taken prisoner by the Japanese. You wonder about his wife and child, but  Manchester doesn't tell you what they want to do: he lets them speak. - An  excellent biography and significant historical account. Probably the best  ever on MacArthur whether you like the general or not.	1999-01-11

Most of the interview, which is written at the Playboy interview  level, is about the Dutch judge's opinion of the methods used in the  trials, and provides a good insight into international law with respect to  war crimes. Judge Roling, and several other judges assigned to the trial,  appeared to be outcasts for various reasons, and Roling creates the  impression, without saying so, that much of the trial was simply a kangaroo  court meant to satisfy political motives. A very interesting account, but  not for the faint hearted reader.	1998-11-30

Yahara is a senior staff office of the Japanese Army defending Okanawa, and he describes the invasion and assault by the overpowering American forces, as well as his strategy to prevent rapid  defeat, which already was a given. This book is quite good, in that: 1) it  presents the view of the beseiged Japanese; 2) it is fast moving and  gripping; 3) and it presents many of those &quot;little facts&quot; that  are missing in history books, such as: how was it in the caves, what did  they eat, how did they escape, did they do stupid things, what did they  think of the Americans, what was it like to be around so many dead Japanese  bodies, what was it like to be captured, were there Japanese POW's  and how  did they react; did they help the American M.P.'s. - This book is quite  good and easy to read, plus has plenty of historical detail and maps. (The  maps are hard to read though...) But overall, the book has value to the  reader of light material as well as to the student of the Pacific War. -  NOTE: the first page of Yahara's account is spellbinding: the Japanese Army  hiding in caves up in the mountains, with Yahara looking down and  reflecting at the hundreds of gray American Navy ships offshore, and the  Marines pouring ashore completely uncontested. It's almost like reading the  glorious acceptance of death in Yahara's mind; a strong impression of an  inevitable death sentence which the Japanese defenders accepted  unhesitatingly and proudly.	1998-11-30

The reporting is meticulous from both the  American and Japanese positions. The author must have been a &quot;fly on  the wall&quot; at both Japanese headquarters and aboard their ships, as  well as at the Pentagon, Roosevelt's office, and at Pearl Harbor, since  there is no other way to account for the rich day to day detail that he  provides the reader.

George Smooth is one of those brilliant scientists you expect to write a book with a lot of equations and boring text, the scientific stuff. Well, Smoot does a wonderful job in this text by getting his readers to start out  with the basics of science and scientific history in a simple and  easy-to-understand-and-comprehend way, and gradually leading you on in a  very interesting manner to the subject of the book: the big bang and the  echo of the noise it made. No boring stuff. That was the first reason I  liked the book; the second was that it shows you that to prove something in  science is not easy: it takes one heck of a lot of grunt work and  time-consuming experimentation along with a lot of travel and a lot of  trials to prove your point. In this book, Smoot shows us that the apparent  (to us) &quot;boring&quot; life of a scientist or learned professor is  actually not boring at all, but persevering and exciting (and at time  disappointing and frustrating), and, if you prove your hypothesis, quite  ennobling. - This book also does something that few other authors has  attempted: he lists in the back of the book many hundreds of those who have  helped him in his task, which makes you realize that in today's world no  scientist operates alone, but necessarily acts as the leader of his/her  scientific project. A really nice guy and superb author.	1998-10-28

However, I was impressed that the author was able to make me, a  non-Maya-history person, get a pretty good grasp on what he was trying to  convey, as well as the method he  followed in attempting to solve the code.  - The reason I purchased this book in the first place was because a long  time ago I read a National Geographic article on the Maya code and how it  was indecipherable until some day somebody would be clever enough to figure  it out. After reading the book, I, a non-scholar, came away with my  curiosity satisfied and proceeded on my way. - And, yes, I strongly agree  with the 1997 reviewer who recommends that &quot;bad mouthing&quot; others  does not belong in this kind of book; to do so causes the book to appear to  be a vanity printing.	1998-10-22

This book is kind of unique since it essentially covers only the last day  or so in Tokyo prior to the surrender by the Japanese government at the end  of the Second World War. Reading about this one day makes it seem like one  of the longest days in history since so much happens: the government trying  to surrender; the emperor under seige by the army; junior officers in the  army trying for a coup d'etat; officers getting murdered; officers  committing suiside. Very much detail and a very clear description of what  happened that day in Japan. Reading this book you get to know the  characters involved and also their personalities. It's almost like reading  a novel. A very powerful one, but a true story. I'd recommend this as MUST  reading for students of the Japanese War. For the general reader it might  be a little too detailed, but it's worth the reading.	1998-10-22

Twining, USMC	Books	3	12	12	N	N	A GOOD ACCOUNT BY ONE OF THE TOP MARINES INVOLVED...	For those deeply involved in reading about the Guadalcanal campaign during  World War II, this book is MUST reading (five stars) since it presents the  &quot;inside&quot; story by one of the major U.S. Marine Crops officers  (Twining) participating in the campaign from the beginning until the Army  took over. For the average reader, however, the account is not  spell-binding and even weak in that the author notes that many early  campaign records were purposely destroyed when it appeared the Marines  might have to evacuate. - Keeping in mind that this is not a broad  historical account such as Richard Franks' &quot;Guadalcanal: The  Definitive Account...&quot;, but rather a Marine participant's journal, it  is very good down-to-earth substantiating reading and provides a lot of  local color and personalities that the writer can place in an  autobiographical piece that a professional author concerned with history  will in most cases ignore. Nice reading.	1998-10-19

However, in this case, Pogonowski comes up with a very helpful format  by providing some historical text followed by numerous large maps showing  that historical activity. This book is very useful if you are reading  accounts of Polish history -- or even a Sienkiewicz novel -- and need to  see the CONTEMPORARY map so that you can associate the history or story  with the ever-changing map of Poland and the Polish Commonwealth. - I like  what the author did. It's very useful. And I recommend the book highly as  an auxiliary reading tool.	1998-10-16

Plus, obviously, some followup on  how she was eventually arrested in the U.S., etc.  This text is a very good  historical and legal account about Tokyo Rose (the one chosen for this  book), her biography, her time in Japan, how she got involved, how she was  arrested in the U.S. and so on, but the narrative is so detailed that it  becomes boring and tends to lose the general reader's interest. On the  other hand, if you are interested in Tokyo Rose's life and personal  problems, and demand a lot of very detailed and specific biographical and  prosecutorial information, this is the book for you. Sorry, not what I was  looking for...	1998-10-16

Despite this book being written just shortly after the American  Revolution, it is surprisingly modern in thought and attitude. It is also  the very best book I've ever read on the American Revolution and really  helped me to understand it much more clearly. Here is why I liked it: 1)  Ramsay gives you a very clear and understandable situation of the colonies  prior to the Revolution; it all now becomes crystal clear in the reader's  ming; 2) he also gives you a very easy understanding of the events that led  up to war and why they occurred; 3) he provides a good account of what our  political leaders were doing during the war, and he provides an equally  clear picture of the English king and politicians, especially the British  Parliament; 4) he never says Benjamin Franklin but always Dr. Franklin, and  makes you realize the power and respect that, may I say it, Ben Franklin  had at the time both here and in England, making you wonder why he wasn't  elected the first president; 5) he shows you the power of lawyers (no  lawyer jokes here) and how, without them, we would never have gotten our  independence; 6) he wonders about the same environmental problems we worry  about today, causing the reader to feel he is ahead of his time, and, 7)  most importantly, the accounts of battles, big and small, and especially  how the civil population tolerated all this goings-on or opposed it...  Despite some of his contemporaries saying Ramsay plagerized [sp] parts of  the book, I really didn't care since it flows so well, presenting so clear  a picture of events and an understanding of those events.	1998-10-16

(In  fact there is only one kielbasy recipe lsited.) - The author(s) describe a  period in Polish history, all of which is very informative, and then give  you recipes for the foods that were prominent at that time. As a result,  you don't get the standard list of Polish recipes, but rather a unique  package of traditional food, going way back. A very nice arrangement and  very nice recipes. Easy to read (very interesting) and printed very nicely,  and it makes you hungry just reading it. Also note: since it goes back in  history, it does ALSO contain those special Lithuanian dishes.	1998-10-16

I had expected this to be an exciting book about spying during the Second  World War, and it was about the spies, but not about events, but about the  people involved and where they traveled to and the disguises they used in  their missions, what colleges they used as fronts, how many books they took  with them, etc. - If you are truly interested in the mundane minute  documentation about the people this is the book for you; but it's not the  book for the general reader. It's too specific and detailed with very  little &quot;spy&quot; action. Not reader friendly.	1998-10-15

There are 3 significant observations I've made while  reading the set of books: 1) his description of the English kings and  queens is easy to follow and his characters are alive (except for the  constant stream of nobility getting their heads cut off), not boring; 2) he  also devotes a lot of the story to America, more than the other  &quot;colonies,&quot; and 3) his history of Britain during the time of the  American Revolution is very skimpy, biased, and does not deal with the real  issues America faced. The book is very poor in dealing with the American  Revolution, but overall the book is essential and easy reading for the  consumate history reader.	1998-10-15

So, if you are NOT really THAT interested in the  subject, it could be a 2-star reading for you.<br />The author talks about  rationing, the various services and how they were formed, what to do with  German and Japanese aliens, rationing of moonshine,  discussion about  nisei, issei, etc., lots of nice information, (some really interesting  stuff) but I was a little disappointed by the &quot;dryness&quot; of the  writing and the fact that the author did not mention some of the more  obvious subjects I personally would like covered, such as Axis war  prisoners interned in the U.S., U-boat activity off the U.S. east  coast...<br />A comprehensive book, but dry, sort of like a very good college  paper. A confusing little book: it lacks that extra zest you expected, but  you still read every word.	1998-10-13

So much had been taken  out to make it concise and easy to read that it lost a lot of voice and it  especially is lacking the Churchill flavor of action and detail that makes  the six volume set exciting and monumental.	1998-10-13

This book sort of explains the question &quot;how could normal people do  such terrible things?&quot; or &quot;how could normal people act that  way?&quot; -  When those normal people are put into a situation that is  abnormal for them and where they are the superior force there is no telling  how far people will drift from their previous normal behavior and thinking.  This book is very interesting in that it shows that most people will  conform to even disgusting behavior  if they start to feel it is the norm  through indoctination, reality, or peer pressure. - . An interesting study  of how people can be modified in their thinking and behavior.	1998-10-13

This book provides a quite open view of the battle of Midway from the  Japanese viewpoint as seen after &quot;all the facts were in.&quot; - The  author seems to provide more useful information in this little paperback  than do much larger hardbacks. The account is fascinating, rich in Japanese  detail, well described, and goes into a what-went-wrong and why reasoning  as each episode unveils itself. If you want to read about the battle of  Midway in the Pacific War, this is the first book you should read.	1998-09-24

This is an excellent and very thorough account of the activity at  Guadalcanal. I was impressed since the author portrays the U.S. Army, Navy,  Marines without bias to any one service, as well as discussing concurrent  Japanese views, plans and strategies. The story unfolds very nicely. It is  not simply a boring factual account since it delves into personalities,  which makes the characters somewhat real. Excellent book.	1998-09-23

I wondered whether this was going to be a boring self-serving narrative,  but once I started reading it, it was so interesting that I couldn't stop.  Ugaki details his day to day activities and lets you know his opinions and  insights as he goes along. You get to like the guy, even though you know,  in some cases, he's trying to fool himself about who's going to win the  war. He is involved in just about everything in the Pacific War, and he  narrates nicely. One of the best parts that you look forward to is where he  and Yamamoto are shot down by U.S. planes. (Yamamoto is killed, but Chief  of Staff Ugagki survives miraculously.) - The editor of this book every now  and then corrects Ugaki (in italics) when Ugaki makes claims, such as ships  sunk and planes shot down. This is extremely helpful, else you might think  like Ugaki. This way you can sort of analyze Ugaki and where he's coming  from. - Ugaki, the consumate samurai ends the book by demanding a kamakazi  plane so he can die gloriously by sinking an enemy ship. He is  unsuccessful. In the end, you sort of like and admire the guy. Very good  reading if you are into the Japanese version of the Pacific War.	1998-09-23

This book contains everything you ever really wanted to know about the sex  lives of the popes and anti popes. (Apparently there were anti popes in  Rome as well as in Avignon.) The book is interesting and even humorous, but  not a serious work of history. Easy reading. It's also a good review of  which pope was which and what sort of people they were personally.	1998-09-23

I agree with one of the reviewers that this book is &quot;not what I  exactly expected.&quot; It is more of a personal account that dramatic  reading. However, if you can get through of a lot of the personal stories  that you are not interested in, the activity in code breaking is  informative. - Not the greatest book of non-fiction, but it could be a  5-star to the Brits involved.	1998-09-23
