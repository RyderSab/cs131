And by &quot;terrible&quot;, I of course mean badly written.<br />Why write this book at all? Apparently Moore's movie &quot;F9/11&quot;, which is doing tremendous box office business as I write this, savages Hardy's hero, the faux-President GW Bush. So, apparently in revenge, he writes a vapid, torpid, churlish and poorly written poison pen piece. And wow, is it ever a piece of... Well, you get the point.<br />The thing is, poison pens can be fun. I mean, look at the works of Dorothy Parker and H.L. Mencken, who regularly skewered politicians, actors, bartenders, directors and anyone else on the American scene with deftness and nonchalance. Mr. Hardy attempts to go after Moore with all the savoir-faire of a street hooligan armed with brass knuckles; but yet does no more damage to Moore or his cause than an anaemic canary. He appears to have forgotten the old adage for satirists: If you can't write something brilliantly insightful, at least be funny.  <br />In the end, the book is little more than boring and brutish tirade. Which may say more about Mr. Hardy than Mr. Moore	2004-06-30

Wodehouse's wonderful upper class twit, somehow becomes involved in the surrealistic universe of H.P. Lovecraft and the wise Jeeves pulls him out. Cannon could have played this strictly for cheap laughs, but no, he clearly and genuinely loves these characters and does all he can to make this an honest and truthful pastiche. I truely love this book (or, at 89 pages, booklet) and only wish I could buy it in hard cover because my copy is falling apart from constant re-reading.	2004-02-17

If you happened to come across a mention of the Kabbalah while checking out some other New Age books, Matt's book is for you. Starting at the very begininng of Jewish Esoteric thought, Matt develops his ideas in a clean, concise fashion, which is something new for commentators on the Kabbalah. If, on the other hand, you are a serious student of Kabbalah or have a passing familiarity with Jewish esoterica, this book will soon reduce you to boredom.	2001-11-06

Here is a book that everyone, Indian or non-Indian, should read by tomorrow at the very latest. Ward Churchill is an extraordinarily gifted Indian (a term he prefers over &quot;Native American&quot; or &quot;Aboriginal&quot;) activist whose prose cuts like a curve-bladed scalpal. Churchill doesn't want to memorialize what American society likes to think of as ancient (and therefore, best forgotten) wrongs; he wants to talk about how white society destroyed and keeps on destroying the Original People of the New World. And he isn't going to do it with quaint tales and stories. He wants you to understand that his people are dying. Right now. This very second.<br />This book, a collection of essays collected over the years, isn't full of the latest spiritual word from Indian Country; don't read this if you want to learn how to construct a sweat lodge &quot;like the real Indians did.&quot; Read this book in order to learn how to be a member of the Wannabe Tribe and you will experience deep spiritual anguish as Churchill's words tear you a new exhust pipe. He doesn't care about your spiritual development; he wants you to understand that genocide is being committed even as you read these words.<br />Get this book. It will hurt a lot to read it, but its better than shutting your eyes to over five centuries of genocide.	2001-04-06

There is nothing better.<br />Having said that, let's look at the book from the science fiction angle. Matiasz knows and effectively uses every tropism of modern SF to very good effect. The use of &quot;other sources&quot; to push the exposition, the plot devices (missing atomic weapons, a Hidden Hero, the idealistic young protagonist who, by learning, reveals all). Wonderful.<br />And even if Matiasz uses trops, he never, ever sinks to stereotypes. There are cops that, while trapped in the System, are also caring and real. And a lot of the comrades are also idiots and buttheads. Every character is real.<br />This book is nothing like the stuff so-called Libertarian SF. It is profoundly and wonderfully great.	2001-04-06

No one, not even ....com, was blind-sided worse by the dot.com crash than this book. Based on the obsolete notion that the so-called New Economy was eternal, it gives new meaning to the word \\"hubris\\". Supposedly detailing the various stereotypes inhabiting the e-companies that sprang up in the wake of the Internet (the \\"Young Entrepreneurial Technocrats\\" of the title), it sets out to prove that everything is cool in E-Land. Sure thing.<br />Paying obsequious homage to the big money powerhouses of E-Land, he also backhands the working class (his words) of the \\"New\\" Economy. You know, the poorly paid, overworked mouse jockeys sitting in their cubicles pounding out code so you can enjoy the newest game based on the last newest game. Of course, when the bubble broke, they were \\"let go\\" (or down-sized or \\"de-hired\\") by the thousands, and now there is a new type of Yettie: the Homeless Nerd.<br />There is also venom for the supposed &quot;fools&quot; who sensed something amiss about the E-Economy: the Analysts and the Journalists. Supposedly anxious about the E-Economy out of jealousy for the dot.com millionaires, they are presented as leeches ready to jump to the E-Economy the first chance they can. Of course! Why on earth could anyone doubt the eternal growth potential of the New Economy unless it was through malice.<br />Sifton blathers on in blind optimism about how Everything Has Changed. Clearly he's never heard Tulip Panic or the Great South Sea Bubble. All those Homeless Nerds are now learning that, no matter how casual he lets you dress, the boss is still the boss.	2001-04-04

Two words for those people: Ba Loney! Those are the same people who think all left-wing books and movies have to follow the precepts of socialist realism: dull and dreary and, in the end, useless.<br />This book has shows Moore to be sharper and a lot angrier than he lets on in his successful movies and television programs. In fact, I was expecting Downsize This! to be a lot lighter than it is. Instead, it's a lot of laughs, but each laugh has a bitter little barb inside.<br />Those still complaining about \\"reaching the people\\" could take a lot of lessons from Moore, and I have no trouble recommending it to anyone who has suddenly realized that things aren't all that great in this tired old world of ours.	2001-01-17

After 55 years of intense and rabid anti-communism, most people can be excused for accepting the old cliches about American Communists: dour, unfeeling and fanatical in their devotion to Moscow's orders. This joint autobiography of Agnes (Sis) Cunningham and Gordon Frieson shows us that, instead, Communists tended to be pretty much like all of us. Driven by a desire to create a better America and repelled by the &quot;everything's for sale&quot; attitude of the two main political parties, they labored through poverty, blacklisting, lynch mobs and government sabotage towards that better America. And they did it all with a song on their lips and in their hearts. An excellent book for those who want to know more about a period when only the very brave questioned the government and the system we live under.	2001-01-17

SF, though, is a bit of an in-group thing,  and folks who really love SF are only too happy to set up endless in-jokes  about their favorite writers, series, etc.<br />Mike Resnick has created yet  one more first rate collection of alternate history stories, but in this  case it is stories about SF writers and trops turned slightly on their  heads. What if Fritz Leiber became an actor instead of a great SF writer?  What if a slightly funnier and intelligent SF writer had  &quot;developed&quot; Dianetics? WARNING: if you're new to SF or not a deep  and heavy fan, some of these stories will run right over your head so  often, you'll develop athlete's foot of the scalp. If you worship the  genre, though, this is your book.<br />Oh, and the title?

Dealing with a future where countless plagues have ravaged humanity, it details an expedition to Titan. By medical necessity, the crew rarely physically interacts with each other  and, in that sense, the relationships are somewhat stilted, somewhat like  &quot;Caves of Steel&quot;.<br />This novel harkens back to the days when  science fiction was about ideas and the characterization was of secondary  import.

Lots of history, which is always  great, besides the usual road info. Take it, 'cause without it, you'll soon  be on that unique BC mountain highway feature, the Runaway Lane!	2000-06-13

His books are always a treat for everyone, SF fan or not. Here, Banks shines  up the old SF plot device of aliens studying our culture, and does right well by it.  Compare this with any of the Star Trek novelizations and I think you'll  agree with me that SF is not dead, it's just stuck in a bit of a loop right  at the moment. With writers like Banks, science fiction will always retain  its ability to surprise, enlighten and thrill us.	2000-06-13

I bought this book in anticipation of a long and arduous car trip through the Canadian Rockies. The roads in that area are absolutely deadly to a car and more so to drivers. Hence, I was looking for something to read when my spouse took over the wheel, something amusing that would take my mind away from the 400 foot drop and the avalanches. This book is it. Sorta. A lot of these stories are of the &quot;American Abroad&quot; school: nope, it ain't like back home at all. This can be funny for awhile, but soon one starts asking why, if they hated not being able to order a Cheeseburger in English in Katmandu so much, did they bother going at all? Then there's those humorists who simply use travel as a hook for their funny stories. Simply put, these stories are the traveller's edition of &quot;three guys go into a bar...&quot; Humor has to be about more than cheap laughs, otherwise it becomes very stale very quickly. Simply put, this book is amusing for a while, but don't expect more than a fast, shallow read and then back to negotiating those hairpin turns	2000-06-13

All the great writers are here, with one exception: there is a signal lack of modern nature writers (last half of the 20th Century). Beyond that, the selection  of great nature writers is first rate.<br />The real problem with this book is  that it is so big and the binding so weak you really can't take this book  into nature to read it. I took it with me during a trip to the north end of  the Queen Charlotte Islands; the moment I found a spot to relax and got the  book out, I found I was wrestling with a ten pound weight that flopped all  over the place. So, a warning: this book is for the fireside or a cozy  evening in bed, not the field. Otherwise, wonderful!	2000-06-13

If you're looking for a guide to explain the intricate game mechanics of this often arcane  RPG, better look elsewhere. If, on the other hand, you're eager to start playing Mage: The Sorcerers Crusade  but know diddly  about the Renaissance (a not-inconceivable  problem given the state of  education nowadays), this book is what you need. In fact, I would suggest  it for anyone needing info about this wonderful period of history. If only  regular textbooks were this exciting &amp; interesting! There is also a  nice little essay on period fencing and dueling which I recommend highly to  the incipient swashbuckler out there. You can do no wrong with this little  gem in your Mage collection. Avanti!	1999-07-14
