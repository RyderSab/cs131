It's arranged alphabetically in English, but in the back is an alphabetic list (without illustrations) in Croatian. <br />The pictures are quite charming, they appear to have been selected from a wide range of sources, and most of them look like the kinds of pictures found in 1960's era school readers.  <br /> <br />My only  real complaint is that some of the words they choose to include are rather odd, with the partial result being that some very common words are left out.  Do we really need to know how to say both 'field mouse' and 'mouse'?  'Bumble bee' and 'bee'? Both 'horn' and 'antler' are included, even though the Croatian word is the same for both.  And we learn such relatively obscure words as platypus, badger, fir tree, and lighthouse.  Which would be fine except that, while we learn many color names, we DON'T learn orange or purple. Quite a few other common nouns and adjectives are also omitted.  (There are comparatively few verbs, but that makes sense since learning the infinitive of a verb isn't much use without learning the tenses, and this book doesn't even begin to touch on the extremely complex topic of Croatian grammar.) <br />A few minor errors in pronunciation as well, but for the most part the pronunciation table seems accurate.  <br /> <br />A worthwhile purchase for any beginning Croatian student, regardless of age.	2005-05-01

I found this book very unhelpful.  The main problem is that there is no way to use what you have learned, or be sure what you are learning. The book consists almost solely of dialogues (each one written in greek lettering, transliterated into english lettering, and translated, all on the same page). There is also information on sentence structure and grammar, and each dialogue chapter includes a vocabulary list. <br /> <br />What the book lacks is any sort of interactive component.  There are no exercises. No passages to translate or questions to answer to demonstrate your understanding.  The book basically expects the learner to memorize the stuff by rote, a VERY outdated method of learning languages.   <br /> <br /> <br />While very basic, \\"Teach Yourself Beginner's Greek Script\\" is much more useful, providing plenty of exercises (most of them fun and imaginative) to support the information in each lesson. <br /> <br />Off to find another more advanced 'teach yourself greek' book, I guess.  <br />	2004-11-20

He requires that you stop treating all your migraines and simply suffering through them, until they .. somehow .. stop occuring on their own.<br />Buchholz is a firm believer in the most extreme version of the 'rebound' theory of migraines -- that, by treating our headaches as much as twice a month, we are, in fact, causing them to happen. (Isn't it funny that nobody ever suggests that, by using pain relievers, arthritis sufferers, or people with cancer or post operative pain are actually 'causing' their pain, but that migraines are, in some mysterious way, caused by the very drugs we need to take to treat them and make our lives managable.)<br />He then follows this with the the old 'it's all caused by what we eat' so you need to also eliminate all the foods you have ever enjoyed from your diet'  snake oil, that I've also heard a thousand times before. (And no, he gives no scientific rational for any of his theories. He fails to even attempt to explain how using narcotics or triptans more than twice a month cause migraines to suddenly start to occur on a daily basis. (Yes, I've seen the 'rebound' theory before, but most doctors who subscribe to it at least claim that it results only after daily or near daily use of pain meds, not once in two weeks!)<br />If you only get the occassional headache, you may find it worth dropping all your meds for  a few months to see if it helps.  But for the rest of us ... we'll stick with what we have, however, imperfect, and keep looking for a more rational, definitive cure.	2003-12-02

At that time, a book like &quot;The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding&quot; was a Godsend to mothers who wanted to breastfeed their babies.  It not only offered them emotional support, and the knowlege that they were doing right by their babies, but it gave them some basic, practical advice on how to nurse. (And how to fight a medical and social establishment that would assume formula-feeding at every turn.)The advice wasn't extensive, but it was better than nothing. It let women know that it was ok (indeed, even desirable) to feed babies on demand, and that most babies would want to eat more than every 3-4 hours in the early weeks. It let women know that it was ok to nurse for more than a few weeks or months. It let women know that it was ok to delay solids past 6 weeks... or even 4 months. Oh yes, and the book also introduced readers to LaLeche League, a hands-on, personal, mother-to-mother support group where women could meet other women who were also nursing their babies.<br />Today, bookstore shelves are overflowing with breastfeeding books. Most general babycare books offer tolerably good breastfeeding advice.  Most doctors and hospitals are reasonably supportive and knowlegable about breastfeeding. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding for a minimum of one year. <br />And... unfortunately, as a general breastfeeding book, Womanly Art has outlived its usefulness.  Its general breastfeeding advice remains minimal and, sometimes, dated.  Its tone has become far too strident for many mothers.<br />If you are interested in a book about LaLeche League, and are already committed to, or at least very open to, its particular mothering philosophy, the book is worth a read.  But it is very much a book about LLL's philosophy (which extends far beyond breastfeeding), NOT a book about how to breastfeed. Forbreastfeeding books there are many, many better choices available.<BR>  <BR>Women who just want breastfeeding advice/information are likely to be offended and turned off by the book's tone and, and minimum, will be frustrated at having to wade through the philosophy in order to find the practical advice.	2003-06-25

She takes gymnastics classes, but with this book she can also work on skills at home, on her mat. (Her MAT, Ninjahawk, not the carpet! Carpeting is not designed for learning front-handsprings, unless you have high hopes of breaking your neck.)<br /> It shows and describes a nice variety of skills. My only complaint is that it covers skills for both girls and boys, so much of the content (rings/pommel horse/paralell bars) is useless.

A gentle, delightful, and timeless series.  My only problem with it is that it a definitely sanitized picture of life on the lower East Side.  The family seemed to be entirely too well-off considering that Papa worked as  a junk dealer. (They ate well, (kosher meat at least once a day, and usually twice) dressed well, lived in a large, well-furnished flat, (had a piano, even!)  vacationed at the seashore, never seemed to worry about doctor bills when the kids got sick, and  the kids got plenty of  pocket money. (A penny a day went a long way back then!) And still, in virtually every chapter the author went on about how poor they were...   In real life, a family in such circumsntances would have had to take in borders, send Mama and Ella to work in the factory, and struggle to just make ends meet.  Still, if you can remember that it is 100% fiction, this book (and indeed, the whole series) make a great read.	2003-03-16

Hats off to Bradt for producing this guide in the first place.  The three destinations covered in the book are about as &quot;off the beaten track&quot; as it's possible to get without falling off the edge of the Earth. They are 3 tiny islands floating in the middle of the South Atlantic.  None can be reached by commercial air service.  St. Helena is accessible by a regular, but quite infrequent passenger ship traveling between England and Cape Town. (The schedule of which requires visitors to spend either only a couple of hours/days on the island, or several weeks.)<BR> Ascension is a stop on a few of the St. Helena runs. Tristan, the most remote of all, is served only by the occassional freighter or private vessel.<BR>Not surprisingly, none of the destinations is exactly overflowing with tourist attractions [though St. Helena, of course, has some Napoleon sites], but this (along with their inaccessibility) means that they aren't exactly overflowing with tourists either.  Which, for some people, is what gives them their appeal.<br />No, I won't be visiting these destinations any time soon.

And some beautiful illustrations as well.<BR>Other reviews have summarized the contents nicely, so I won't bother.<BR>I took one star away, because a few of his statistics strike me as questionable. (I'm not sure that they are wrong, so I won't down-grade him more than one star.) For example, he claims that the average age at marriage was 26 for women, 28 for men. Which seems quite high to me. (While it is a myth that everyone married at 15, early 20's seems more realistic. Unless he is including remarriage of widows/widowers in his figures, which would, of course, bring the average up.) He also claims an average birthrate of about 3 children per family, with a 'survival-past-childhood' rate of less than 2 ... a figure which would have resulted in the total disappearence of the population within a few generations. And finally, while he doesn't give specific literacy figures, he seems to imply that literacy was quite widespread ... which was not the case, and continued to be not the case for quite some time after the introduction of movable type. (Books were extremely expensive, well beyond the means of even the middle classes, let alone the vast peasant/working classes. Most people had no use for reading. The gentry/nobility were usually literate [at least the male half]. Below that level of society, outside the monestaries, very few people could read or write.<br />Despite these flaws, the book has a lot of interesting information. (Though he does seem to be trying VERY hard to demonstrate that various objects/stories/songs/games/activities were used/read/sung/played/done by children ... rather than by society as a whole.)Well worth the read, though it might be worth waiting to see if it comes out in paperback.	2002-12-02

While the title of the book is \\"The Worth of Women\\", the dialogue spends FAR more time talking about the lack of worth of men. (The author's basis thesis seems to be that women are virtually perfect, so the occassional \\"bad\\" woman is either an utter anomoly, or has been made \\"bad\\" due to the influence of men; while men are basically evil, and the even rarer \\"good\\" man is an anomaly.)

So it isn't all factually accurate.<br />WHile a few of the \\"Little Houses\\" still exist, most are long gone.

(For example, when Pa added the bedrooms onto the claim shanty at the beginning of \\"Little Town on the Prairie\\", Laura describes it as \\"building the other half of the house,\\" meaning, to my mind, that the rooms should have been side by side; the same size as the original shanty room. THe author here shows them as being one behind the other, and taking up only half the legnth of the shanty.)<br />The recipes, while interesting, seem less historically accurate than the ones in the \\"Little House Cookbook.\\" (Almanzo's \\"Long Winter\\" pancakes probably wouldn't have had eggs in them.)<br />And there are a few other minor factual errors, both in relation to Laura's real life and to her life as portrayed in the books.<br />Still a very worthwhile purchase for anyone interested in the book series.	2002-12-02

Contrary to what one reviewer wrote, this is NOT a book that tells you what to expect if you give birth in a hospital with an OB.  Believe it or not, not all OBs tell their patients that epidurals are gifts from God, and that no woman would want to do without one unless she is out to 'prove something' or is misinformed.<BR> Not all OBs 'rely heavily on inductions' in their practices. Not all hospitals chain women to monitors for their entire labors, confine women to bed, and offer mothers epidurals as soon as the contractions get a bit uncomfortable and the cervix has started to show some change. (I mean.. gosh... if I'd been offered an epidural at that point I would have gotten one while still laboring at home at 1 cm.)<br />Why are women riled up?  Perhaps because some women don't like being told that, if they don't want to plan on an epidural from the start, it must mean that we are misinformed,trying to be a martyr, or that we just don't know how much labor is going to hurt. (And that, once we start laboring, we will almost certianly change our minds anyway, so we may as well just plan to have one from the start.)  We don't like being told that we will appreicate being confined to bed, because women don't really want to walk around during labor anyway.<br />I am assuming that HER patients are patients who want a high tech, 'managed' labor. (Other women would likely run screaming.) And that's fine.  But she should make it clear in her book that HER style of birth managament is not the only one, and not the best one -- but is simply the style that she prefers for herself.<BR>She should make it clear that a more natural birth (even with an OB, in a hospital) is just as safe, just as acheivable,and for many rational, informed women, far more desirable.<br />And I disagree with the idea that most other books are anti-epidural.  Most books give a balanced view of the pros and cons of epidurals, and note that if a woman needs pain relief and other, more natural methodsare not desired or ineffective, an epidural is a good choice.  They do NOT say, as Brasner does, that epidurals are perfectly safe, and she can't understand why any woman would want to labor without one.  (Which is both, IMO, inaaccurate and narrow minded.)<br />Not a good pregnancy book for anyone, except possibly for a woman who doesn't want to make any choices in her labor, or understand what is going on ... in which case she could just as easily save her money and not buy any books at all.	2002-10-22

As a collector of 19th century text books, I was interested to find that this book and others, are being reprinted for use by homeschoolers.<BR>This book, while a fascinating historical reprint, really serves to demonstrate what was WRONG with schools 2 centuries ago, and to dispute the belief that modern schools are bad and old fashioned schools were good.<BR>When the blue backed speller was first used, students were expected to simply memorize columns of spelling words, and recite them, orally, for the teacher. That was pretty much the sole curriculum for the first several years of schooling. (After which they moved on to actual reading books.)<br />Can a modern family use this book?  Sure, in combination with other texts, and with more modern teaching methods.  Is this book the secret to literacy?  No. And anyone familiar with history would know that functional illiteracy is not a modern problem. Students a century or two ago were just as likely to leave school barely able to read or write. The only difference was that, at that time, it was possible to get through life fairly easily with minimal or no literacy. Children who really struggled in school during the 19th century simply LEFT. With no compulsary attendance laws, the poor student would leave school after a couple of years and go to work on the parents' farm, or in the factory, or be apprenticed out to learn a trade.<br />I'm sure this book would be of some use to a homeschooling family. But the reason homeschooled children tend to learn more rapidly than their public schooled peers has nothing to do with the books being used. It has to do with the amount of time and attention paid to the needs of the students. There are far better books available for families who want to home school; books that take into account modern knowlege about how children learn. (Webster believed that it was not necessary for children to know the meaning of the words they learned to spell. He believed that rote memorization was the best way for children to learn.)	2002-10-17

He wrote guidebooks for the 'average' traveller who couldn't afford luxury hotels and didn't need crystal chandeliers (or even private bathrooms) and caviar, but wanted to see the world. <BR>Today, Frommer is one of several publishers of such guidebooks and is, in most aspects, the worst. (Though the guides that focus on only one or two cities are usually quite good.) The books typically list only a small handful of hotels and restaurants for each destination. Attractions listings are also quite limited. While Moon and Lonely Planet don't give quite as many details about each listing, they provide far more options, as well as better, more detailed information about the practicalities of travel. (How to get there, what the ticket is likely to cost, how often transportation runs, etc.) And with the internet offering websites on most hotels and major attractions (though few restaurants, especially outside the U.S.)<br />readers seeking out details can usually just check the website.<BR>(&quot;Let's Go&quot; guides are also excellent, though targeted at the lowest end budget traveller,  and  they don't cover the Carribean.)<br />Other problems with this particular guide:  Several islands are omitted without explanation. (Anguilla and St. Barts are not typical bargain destinations, but they do have inexpensive lodging available, and are both easily visited as day trips if desired.) <BR>Annual updating seems minimal at best.<br />Not a terrible guidebook, and if visiting the carribean and you want to cover all bases, this is a good choice to supplement some better guides and some time on the web. But perhaps it's better borrowed from the library than purchased.	2002-10-09

It ISN\\"T just their opinion that breastmilk is best for babies, so if they use some strong words to get mothers to breastfeed, and help them succeed, they are only being honest.<br />A few of these reviews made me laugh.  Several reviewers criticized the authors for saying, for example, that you should nurse whenever baby is hungry... resulting in them nursing 24/7 for days on end and not eating or sleeping. Surely, as adults, we can use a little common sense to interpret what we read.  Yes, parents are allowed to eat and sleep too, and nature does not intend for babies to nurse 24/7 for weeks. (Though, if the complaining mother had tried a sling, or getting some help from her spouse or friends, she could have eaten while nursing...) If co-sleeping doesn't work in your family, put baby in a crib. <br />And as for the reviewer who said that the Sears told mothers to avoid treating illnesses so they could nurse ... I suspect she misunderstood.  I don't have the book in front of me, but what I THINK they meant was that you don't HAVE to wean to treat most illnesses.  The vast majority of medications are perfectly safe to use while nursing, (or have a safe alternative) yet many doctors will tell mothers that they have to wean, at least temporarily, if they are ill and need to take medication.  The point is that the risk to the baby from traces of maternal medication in the milk is far, far smaller than the risk to the baby of being fed formula instead. (Even for a short while, and since few mothers are able to pump-and-dump for several weeks and then get baby back on the breast, even 'temporary' weaning very often ends up being permanent weaning.)<BR>And comfort nursing does not teach bad habits...<br />Yes, the Sears do encourage new mothers to stay home with their babies, if possible.  But if the mother can't, she can't, and the book does discuss the issues of employed mothers. (And, to respond to another reviewer, you really CAN get out of the house during the firstyear while nursing on demand, comfort nursing, and using cloth diapers.)<br />If you want a book that tells you that \\"breast is best, but formula is just as good, and if you just don't want to nurse, or you have some minor difficulties and want to quit, that's perfectly ok too,\\" I'd recommend \\"What to Expect\\" or any of the other general parenting books.  But if you want an honest, well-written text that promotes breastfeeding, doesn't mince words, and helps mothers to succeed, this is an excellent choice.	2002-10-09

So I have no immediate plans to visit Disneyland <BR>Paris, but, as a committed Disneyphile, I decided to<BR>check this one out, to see if, if and when I DO<BR>someday go to Paris, it would be worth a visit.<BR>Now, I don't know for certain how identical DLP is to<BR>Walt Disney World, but from the guidebook, you would<BR>think they were virtual clones.  While DLP has a few<BR>unique rides (which get their own, original descriptions),<BR>most of the ride descriptions, and the guest comments,<BR>are lifted directly from the other guidebooks. Isn't it<BR>AMAZING that a mother visiting DLP with her son had<BR>EXACTLY the same experience on Dumbo as a mother who visited<BR>WDW a decade or more ago? Much of the other information<BR>(advice on visiting with kids, planning your day, understanding<BR>traffic flows, meeting characters, etc.) is also reprinted,<BR>virtually word for word, from the other Disney guides.<br />Of course there is some unique information. The hotels and<BR>restaurants are described (the latter very briefly indeed -- 3-10 lines per restaurant, with no real description of the food, and only the most general indication of cost); you can apparently buy cigarettes in the park in Paris, and the few rides unique to DLP are described. (Interestingly, he doesn't seem to care for most of them.) He also gives basic information on getting to Paris, finding in-town hotels, and so on.<br />But most of it is just a tired rehash.  Instead of giving us<BR>a generic \\"DisneyX\\" book, why couldn't he focus on what makes<BR>DLP different from the other parks? I'd guess that most readers, at least most American readers, have already been to either WDW or DL, and already know the basics. They are not going to be planning a trip to France JUST to take Junior to DLP as their first visit to a Disney park. <BR>If Sehlinger REALLY doesn't want us to<BR>go to DLP (he doesn't like most of the unique rides; the few rides for which he mentions differences from the U.S. version[for example, the French \\"Haunted Mansion\\"], get a poorer review here, and he thinks the food is lousy and overpriced) why not just say so, and save us the cost of the book.<br />OTOH, if you've never been to any Disney park, and never read a<BR>Disney Unofficial Guidebook, this might be of some use.	2002-06-27

This was NOT the book's fault.  Early entry was cancelled last fall, after the 9/11 tourism slump -- which was after the book had already been published.) But other information SHOULD have been up to date. Restaurant reviews include discussion of dishes and prices that haven't been right for 5 years or more. And some restaurants aren't mentioned at all. (Beaches and Cream; Plaza.) Fastpass has been available for quite some time, but is mentioned only as an aside for most rides. (Using fast-pass can virtually eliminate waits, yet he usually sugggests it as an unimportant option.) The book is also focused on guest who visit during the busy seasons. For off-season travellers, most of his tips (esp. his touring plans) are unneccessary and confusing.<br />I also found it amusing and ironic that, in the earlier editions, he complained about slow restaurant service, suggesting that buffets would help matters. So now, when Disney has changed several sit down restaurants into buffets -- he complains that buffet food isn't as good as freshly cooked!<br />Still, a useful guidebook that should, ideally, be used in conjunction with at least one other guide for a more accurate overall picture. (And word has it that some of the errors will be corrected in the 2003 edition.)	2002-06-26

I mean, the title of the book IS \\"Great Museums of Italy,\\" NOT \\"Art from the Great Museums of Italy.\\"  I knew, when I bought the book that, given that it was trying to cover 8 major gallories in about 230 pages, there would not be more than a small representative selection of works from each musuem; but, even so, I expected much more than I actually got. While each museum IS represented by a small selection of major works, large amounts of space are devoted to text on the history of the museum and its collections, detailed descriptions of the works shows (discussion of the artist, the provenance of the work, etc.), and photos of the interior and exterior of the building.<br />If you are interested in museum history, this may be the book for you (and even I found interesting the picture of the Brera Gallery in the late 19th century, with artwork hung, literally, edge to edge and floor to ceiling on the walls -- and comparing it to pictures of the galleries today, with some major paintings getting an entire wall to themselves, and most others spaced widely on the gallery walls), but, as a book for museum lovers, it provides a frustratingly minimal selection of works.<br />A few other issues with the book:<br />1. Reproduction of the art is often poor. At first I thought that  maybe the pictures themself were dirty/faded, and the printer had done the best he could. But, when I compared a couple of pictures in this book with reproductions of the same pictures in my 1970 \\"BreraMilan\\" (by Newsweek Books), it seems that this is not the case. Mantegna's famous \\"Dead Christ is noticibly more washed out and bluish in the newer book, while Caravaggio's \\"Supper at Emmaus\\" is far darker and lacking in color contrast.<br />2. The inclusion of the Ufizzi Gallery is a bit of a puzzle to me. Being, with little question, the most important gallery in Italy (perhaps second to the Vatican Museums), the Ufizzi is already well covered by numerous, well printed, art books, several of which are still in print.
