Second, many parts of the body and engine are similar to many other cars, and at points throughout the book it feels like the authors just copied and pasted whole sections from another manual in the Haynes series.<br /><br />This book would benefit from a section at the front where the engine is thoroughly diagrammed. I would like to be able to look at a series of photos and know how to identify every part of the car. Maybe even they could stoop to the level of giving us a sentence or two about what each part does. As it's set up now, I find myself flipping between chapters a lot to find where a particular engine component is located.<br /><br />For more advanced mechanics, those suggested components aren't necessary, I'm sure. But I get the impression that's not who this book is aimed at in the first place.	2005-09-07

The characters she brings to life are memorable, and it's hard not to look back on them with affection.<br /><br />Still, if you're considering this book for an Advanced Placement English class or in preparation for one in the future, you should be aware that while the debate over whether this book is great literature continues, the AP Board has come down on the side of those who say it isn't. If you're looking for writing from the American South that is AP-worthy, I strongly recommend Flannery O'Connor or William Faulkner. Also worth a try is Eudora Welty.	2005-08-30

His style--clean-chiseled characterizations and sentences that cut to the chase--was unlike the work of his contemporaries.<br /><br />Most novels that influence literature in this way die a short death. They are stylistically innovative, but soon other writers perfect what they pioneered. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald manages the amazing feat of simultaneously innovating and perfecting. In that, the novel is pure genious.<br /><br />The Great Gatsby is the saddest novel I have ever read, because it goes to a deeper level than just tear-jerking. It ends in a place of complete emptiness, despair, and loss. It's a book that will satisfy you emotionally and intellectually, and also a book that will show you how powerful true emotion can be.	2005-08-30

Every breath, every step, every bad joke has significance because it could be your last. \\"The Things They Carried\\" is a remarkable achievement in the wide span of elements it is able successfully to blend into a masterpiece: the deeply personal and the broad overarching systems, humor and horror, the momentary and the everlasting, the base and the transcendent, the thick confusion of the Vietnam jungle and the vast clarity of a composed mind. At times this book is difficult to stomach. O'Brien's story is haunting, and when it comes to mind long after you've read it, you may find yourself reflecting that if you knew every breath and step and bad joke was full of significance, a lot in life might be hard to stomach, too.	2005-08-30

Forget how simple it is to boil the Bible down into a practical lifestyle for today. Here is the Bible in all its historical complexity, in a rigorous and dependable English translation.<br /><br />This NRSV is, in many ways, quite accessible: It is well designed and cleanly arranged. The detailed notes and scholarly chapter introductions help break up big questions into manageable pieces. For Protestants like me, this is especially helpful when it comes to the Apocrypha. Also, at the sentence level this is an approachable and even warm translation. The \\"N\\" in \\"NRSV\\" means no \\"thees and thous\\" to trip over, as well as the elimination of gender biases not found in the original Greek and Hebrew.<br /><br />In other ways, this edition is very challenging. Gone are the \\"Apply This!\\" tips from your Evangelical pals. No one's explaining why Nehemiah is a good example of leadership, or the church today can take heed to Paul's letter to the Romans. You don't even get the comfort of \\"B.C.\\" and \\"A.D.\\" in the dates, which instead are represented as B.C.E. and C.E. In readability, it's less wooden than the NASB but not nearly as liquid and simple as The Living Bible or The Message paraphrase. It demands close reading and real pondering.<br /><br />The power this edition holds for Christians is not that it will confuse and disorient, but rather that it forces the reader to notice that God's Word is always before us, that we can never get our minds around it or capture it with watercolor illustrations and leather book covers. Reading this Bible is a unique experience. Like seeing God's face, it is at once frightening and comforting, for we know we are seeing the omnipotent almighty who rules all truth and yet loves us enough to allow us to find it.	2005-08-29

The Chronicles of Narnia and \\"Mere Christianity\\" are great books, in part because both are highly accessible to a general audience. If you want to swim out into deeper, more difficult waters, The Screwtape Letters are a fabulous collection for intermediate swimmers who wish to prepare themselves for more.	2005-08-29

In 1957 Lewis wrote a letter to an American boy in which he wrote, \\"I think I agree with your order [i.e., chronological] for reading the books more than with your mother's. The series was not planned beforehand as she thinks.\\"<br /><br />Give this order a chance and you may find yourself delighted and surprised. These books are so beautiful it would be difficult for them to be ruined by any choice of sequencing. Lewis was, after all, a reader of medieval literature, in which chronological order was the accepted fashion for structuring a narrative. He seemed to find the variation found within that structure endlessly amazing.	2005-08-26

However, when they tried to apply it to their relationship with me as their son, a lot of it just didn't compute. The love between a child and a parent doesn't fit neatly into one of Chapman's five (such a small number!) love languages, regardless of how much they wanted it to.<br /><br />The truly great books that have been written teach us how complicated and messy love is and can be. Not only does Chapman undermine this lesson with his quick and easy categories, but he also severely neglects the very subject he has chosen as his title: language. Yes, \\"Words of Affirmation\\" is one of his five \\"languages,\\" but there are so many other ways in which humans use language to express love for each other besides by offering explicit affirmation. (Think, for instance, of the teasing between Fred and Ethel on \\"I Love Lucy.\\") And is it really helpful to think of receiving gifts, acts of service, and physical touch as \\"language\\"? The metaphor is detrimental. Gifts, actions, and touches can carry great meaning, but they do it in a very different way than language does. That is part of the wonder and mystery of human existence.<br /><br />Nothing can replace the use of actual language, of forming words into the spoken sentence \\"I love you.\\" Other ways of demonstrating our love for one another back up this bit of language. They do it specifically by being something other than words.	2005-08-26

You shouldn't expect to read this book and walk away with six points to remember and apply. But you can count on enjoying the sharp writing and the engaging stories. It's unbelievable that a book about the human mental capacity to make split-second decisions could be this readable.<br /><br />This book ultimately adds up to a great big \\"something to think about.\\" But the earnest work and feeling Gladwell has invested in this book of real substance make mulling it over deeply rewarding.	2005-08-26

The first: these are excellent slam poems. The second: these are (mostly) disappointing printed-page poems.<br /><br />If you have experienced slam poetry, either live or via audio or video recording, \\"Aloud\\" helps you appreciate how performance-intensive slamming is. A group of juvenile delinquents can perform a scene of Shakespeare and still retain much of its poignance and beauty, for such was Shakespeare's skill with words. Not so with most of the poems in \\"Aloud\\"--in the wrong hands, they could be very disappointing slam poems indeed. Had others written and performed them, they likely would never have made it into this collection.<br /><br />In short, all but a few poems in \\"Aloud\\" don't measure up to the canon of printed-word poems humans have amassed over the centuries. And yet, when read aloud, or considered as only half of a slam poem (the peformance being the other half), they can surprisingly come to life with power and grace.	2005-08-12

If reading, writing, and 'rithmatic aren't a person's strong spots, he may still be very bright in other areas. When Gardner first began studying and writing about multiple intelligences, it seemed revolutionary. Now it defines the accepted mainstream in how adept teachers conduct their classrooms.<br /><br />When such a great mind decides that he wants to turn away from multiple intelligences theory and put his energies elsewhere (for the rest of his life if he can find the funding), it is worth noting what that area is. Gardner has explicitly said the subject of \\"Good Work\\" (both what it is and how we can foster and encourage it) so interests and engages him that he could study it for decades to come. It seems to me that suggests it's not a bad idea to inquire what \\"Good Work\\" is all about.<br /><br />Gardner and his colleagues wonder what work that is both excellent (of the highest quality, no cut corners) and ethical (of the sort that makes you proud to look yourself in the mirror and announce what you do for a living) looks like and where it thrives. Their approach is simultaneously scientifically rigourous and achievably applicable.<br /><br />We live in a time when the corporate model of profit through any means (or any means that won't turn away most consumers) dominates the business mindframe. We need a new paradigm and vocabulary for discussing what success is all about and how it can be reached. Gardner and his partners have begun that great work.	2005-08-12

His discussion goes on for roughly 350 pages yet rarely becomes repetitive or obtuse. Much has been written on the aesthetics of many other art forms both high and low--music, painting, and architecture, for instance--even though most of us freely acknowledge that what makes these art forms wonderous and human is impossible to explain in plain language. Why are we moved by melody, drawn in my a painting, or surprised by a great building? It's possible to discuss these questions but not to pin down the answers. The wonderful thing is how these discussions become more pleasurable rather than less so because they have no definite end.<br /><br />In this vein, McFee's lengthy book on the aesthetics of dance is not conclusive. Yet while McFee never pins down exactly why humans dance and enjoy watching others dance, he firmly nails down components of the answer that enrich and enliven thought and discussion on the subject of dance.<br /><br />\\"Understanding Dance\\" is not a practical guide to how to watch and quantify particular dance performances. There is no glossary, and you won't find a chart explaining the differences between jazz, tap, modern, and ballet dance styles. Still, its unique approach makes it a worthwhile and memorable read both for people deep in the world of dance and also for people just getting their feet wet. Rather than being full of jargon and dancing fundamentals, this book takes a broad and high approach to the subject of dance. You won't learn the difference between a pirouette and a grand jet&eacute;, but you will understand much more deeply why it is so pleasurable and inspiring to watch a ballet troupe (or any group of dancers) perform.	2005-08-12

Lewis is: he is endearing, humble, and gentle--a man of style, grace, and quick wit--while remaining tough, straightforward, and confident. Even if you don't pay attention to what Hugo is saying, the way he says it could carry you though the book enjoyably.<br /><br />Hugo's intent in assembling this book of lectures and essays is to teach and instruct hopeful poets, and for him the soul of poetry pedagogy is basically (and simply) to save students time, to show them what they would eventually teach themselves if they continued writing on their own.<br /><br />The danger in \\"The Triggering Town\\" is that Hugo is at once demanding and seductive. He doesn't put his suggestions and opinions in uncertain terms, and yet he avoids coming off as a control freak by expressing his thoughts so beautifully and clearly. Reading Hugo, it's difficult not to be wooed into becoming a Hugoite.<br /><br />Make no mistake: There are far, far worse things for a poet than to follow Hugo's advice and methods. Still, if a poet is never able to shrug off some of Hugo's axioms, she will never achieve true greatness. Conventional wisdom has it that only after you have learned to follow the rules can you break them. There is truth in this. But it possible to be taught the rules so well that one can never break them. It is a daunting task for any poet to muster up the sense of authority to dismiss Hugo's teaching. If a poet is too shy and insecure to throw away his teacher's instruction (as many greats are), perhaps the best path is to avoid the formal instruction Hugo offers and to simply read the fruit of great poets instead.	2005-08-12

While every other major news source in America was trying their hardest to sneek people into the ground zero scene (the New York Times got a reporter in because he was wearing a Marines t-shirt and he simply didn't leave for about two weeks), the Atlantic thought carefully about how best to cover the story and then asked permission to the appropriate people to get William Langewiesche on the scene. Since a higher-up knew and respected Langewiesche's work, Langewiesche was given total access to everything--the entire site of Ground Zero, all records, all meetings, all people. No other reporter in the world had such access.<br /><br />Langewiesche writes in a narrative style that paints a human picture of what happened while giving information that no one else had access to.<br /><br />I recommend this book. It's not an \\"objective\\" (read: inhuman) account, but neither is it a politically tainted account. William Langewiesche has spent years abroad covering wars and disasters; he recognizes the extent of the loss of life and the contours of horror and hope that surround Ground Zero, yet his account is not one of either mourning or hero-worship, as much as those responses are warranted. His account is one of a well-trained journalist who was really there in the middle of things for months. Langewiesche has earned my trust but he has not earned everyone's. Regardless of how trustworthy you decide he is, I think his report, which includes straight factual reportage as well as his personal analyses, is important. He has done the work of historians several decades ahead of time, and personalized it, since he actually spent lots of time at the site and built relationships with many of the people involved in orchestrating the unbuilding effort.	2002-10-29

Which is a big part of why it (unlike the other titles) accomplishes the feat of being literature handily.<br />Usually, when I finish a fast-paced book, I put it aside and think about how enjoyable of a read it was.  Then I think about it some more, and that's about my only thought: that was a good read.  In contrast, reflecting on Winter's tale raises a host of deep questions, of which our culture of guns and violence is only a small part.  Winter's story compells us to reconsider our notions of self and loyalty and identity.<br />Two things set this book apart from others that may seem like it: First, the pace is ferocious, but not just because of plot and character.  Winter writes in language that forces us to sprint to keep up, language that buzzes and pops and surprises.  Second, this book is compelling in a way that many other books described as \\"compelling\\" are not--it actually compells the reader toward something, toward deep introspection and specific questions that ring of universal consequenses.<br />With scenes darker and tougher than any Spielberg film, narration quirkier than Catcher in the Rye or Clockwork Orange, and writing that reveres language in a way Bret Easton Ellis (American Psycho) falls far short of, this book is truly of high literary merit.	2002-07-02
