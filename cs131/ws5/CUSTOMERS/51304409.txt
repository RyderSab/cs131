From basic trekking to how to ride a camel. The book is written from a UK perspective and as such is a different way of looking at things. The kayaking section is weak as are the mountaineering and skiing sections but it makes up for this in the expedition travel side of things.	2005-10-03

I had hoped it would be up to the standards of the authors previous book Weapons of the Navy Seals Volume 1 from a few years ago (there never was the promissed V2). However this book falls short of the mark. The information is dated and there are very few illustrations. The information presented on pre 1990 is pretty good, however the lack of photos and supporting data is a great detraction. I really hope the author does follow up with better supported title. Until then I reccomend Pushies book on Weapons of the Navy Seals.	2004-11-27

The kind that you prep at home.

Unless you have no idea of kayaking this is not the book for you. The information is so basic and elementary that I was vey disapointed.

As many of these are no longer availible this is a good collection for the newby interested in the history of 1960-1980 special operations.	2002-11-02

All the information in this book could be gleaned off of the net in avout 20 minutes. So look elsewhere for this information. I believe that &quot;Baz&quot; is cashing in on America's fears.
