This is the most awful tripe I have ever read in my life.  He's a cross between Rush Limbaugh and the imperial wizard of the KKK.  This book is one long tirade against women, gays, blacks, immigrants, you name it.  I too am tired of extreme liberal thinking, but this book is one long rant without any facts to support his claims.  It's all \\"those guys back then were true patriots\\" to crying the typical conservative agenda which goes something like this: \\"We're (conservatives) are getting persecuted.  They will outlaw our religion.  Please send $___ to my organization so that we can fight those filthy liberals away so that we conservatives can be free to push our agenda.\\"  <br />Getting rid of a extremely liberal government and replacing it with the type Savage advocates is akin to getting rid of white supremacist laws and replacing them with anti-white laws.  We need a balance between liberalism and conservativism.  <br />To be honest, this book is a lot more angry and hateful sounding than the book 'My Awakening' written by David Duke, a high ranking Klansman.  Even Hitler's writing is more coherent and polite sounding than Savage.<br />Read this book to know how people like Savage think.  I learned in my academic career that you are best to read books you don't agree with, so that you can understand where they are coming from.  As my father so often advised me, \\"Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.\\"	2003-10-07

I'd like books out there to discuss the dangers of anti-white predjucie. I'd like books out there that show it is just as racist to stereotype whites as it is to stereotype blacks or jews.  As for the 'white power' reviewer-he is obviously a racist, a self hating white person.  As well, calling Hispanics a 'race' is nonsense.  There are hispanics who are white, and there are hispanics who are black.  There are Italians who are white, and there are Italians who are black.<br />This typical 'white men are all racist' book reminds me of a quote from the movie, Lean on Me.  Morgan Freeman is standing in front of a group of inner city kids, to which he says, &quot;If you do not suceed in life, I don't want you to blame the white man.  I don't want you to blame your parents.  I want you to blame yourselves.  The responsibility is yours.&quot;  That line alone should already mean something for all of us.	2003-09-21

I am a recent college graduate and I can relate to many of the modern day students in this book.  The programs like &quot;diversity&quot; and &quot;affirmative action&quot; are hidden agendas against whites and Europeans to feel collectively guilty for all the oppression against non-whites.

What he said really reflected the times of how blacks were treated in America.  Even as a white guy, I thought he was making many blanket statements about whites, but then I had to keep reminding myself, \\"These were different times, put it into context.\\"  If he said these things today about whites, then I would say he was just making excuses, but there definitely was institutionalized racism against blacks at that time.<br />Some people say these problems against blacks still exist.  I disagree to a certain extent.  I think most problems blacks face today are to their own making-high crime, unwed motherhood, rap, etc... True, there are whites (and blacks too) that are personally prejudice against people not of their kin.  Malcolm X had a point back then about how the whites made it hard for blacks to get ahead, but such an excuse doesn't work today.  Look at the many preferential treatments offered to blacks and Hispanics.  As well, why is Malcolm X any better than Booker T. Washington, someone who spoke in much higher regards about black American than did Malcolm X?<br />I do think Malcolm X's message about standing up for your rights can be applied to any group: gays, atheists (such as I am) and even whites(?).  For example, Malcolm X had persuasive arguments against racist whites, which I use against predjudice theists who tell me, \\"You stupid atheists!  There are no atheists in fox holes. This is 'one nation under god'.\\"<br />However, I do think Malcolm X would have been more successful than to write off all whites as bigots. There were whites that were against the way blacks were treated, but what could they do about it?  They could have lost their jobs or even their lives possibly, by standing up for black rights.  I mean, wouldn't you call me a bigot for making negative blanket statements about non-whites?  Same thing goes both ways.  It is ironic that Malcolm X thought the 'white man is the devil' yet it wasblack racists that gunned him down!<br />Read this and a book by Larry Elder called 'Ten Things You Can't Say In America'	2003-07-08

Populations rise and fall over time. Even if the West and Europe increase their numbers they will have draining resources. More people in a society, more resources it takes to acquire it. China had this same problem, which is why they had to limit the amount of children they had.<br />I find it a little appalling how Buchanna uses the founding fathers to justify his arguments, yet complains about the Ten COmmandments being taken down. First of all, the founding fathers were very against have religion mix with politics, and they would have greatly approved of removing the Ten Commandments off government property.<br />There is nothing wrong with maintaing Christian values. The problem is when religioin mixes with politics. When that happens you have countries like Iran or Ireland. Those countries aren't getting along, and that is due to the government pushing religion with politics.<br />I do certainly agree with Pat that many of the immigrants don't care about America, and are making us have to adapt to their cultures.  If you want to live in someone's country, then YOU learn their language, YOU respect their culture.  The Europeans and Asians respected our culture when they came here, why can't the immigrants today?<br />I also agree with Pat that the double standards and hypocricies with the black rights/gay rights groups have got to stop.  Sure the murder of Matthew Shephard was terrible, but why is it worse than the 4 white, hard working college students that were murdered in Wichita, KS?	2003-03-11

It would make sense that kids learn the dangers of homophobic bigotry, by reading this book.  It will open your eyes!  The same anti-gay stereotypes then, are the same ones now.  <br />This book is about a gay man who survived the Pink Triangle, and took him over 25 years to tell his story, as their were still many anti-gay laws on the books there.  This man never wanted any public or economic gains from telling his story. In fact the Nazis had more contempt for the gays than they did the 'inferior racial groups' they persecuted.	2003-01-22

I am really tired of both Democrats and Republicans.  They both seem to have an agenda to screw with our lives.  Ann Coulter, seems to display the 'us vs.them' tirade.<br />First, Coulter states liberals hate Christians.  Really?  So what about Martin Luther King...or Jesus? They were Christians.  As well, I can name Republicans that are very critical of Christianity. I can also name conservatives that are against capital punishment and pro-choice, yet Democrats who take opposite views.<br />As well, I don't care for how Coulter called Ventura a bigot, simply because he pointed out religion is a crutch. He's right.  It is.  People not only are attached to religion, but the fundamentalists seem to have an agenda to use the governemnt to promote their views.  That's why Ventura called religion a 'sham and a crutch.'<br />Second, she condones the bigoted crazy statement by Falwell.  In case you don't remember, Falwell blamed 9/11 on gays and secular humanism.  Even Bush called Falwell \\"ludicrous\\"!  <br />Yes, liberals do seem to be anti-wealth, preferential treatment, and condensending at times.  However, Coulter is just doing it from the other side, as far as I am concerned.<br />As the Libertarian motto goes, \\"Stay out of our wallet (to liberals) and out of our bedrooms (to conservatives?\\"<br />Or another joke for you: Why are Conservative Christians so angry?  Because they are worshipping the biggest liberal of all. Ha!	2003-01-22

One for example, was how he downplayed the history of the KKK, making them look like \\"innocent vigilantes.\\"  That is what the Klan has said for many years, and that is how they manipulated frustrated whites to join.<br />Another thing hard to swallow was when he stated homosexuals have molested millions of kids.  Where on earth did he get that information, because I didn't see any sources for it.  Gays and child molesting aren't a correlation.  Straights molest children, too.  Duke is right that homosexuality doesn't produce children, but that doesn't mean it is harmful.  I mean, look at the many single mothers out there, who get knocked up, their husband/boyfriend leaves, and then we have to pick up the tab.  So actually, single motherhood is more of a drain on society than homosexuality.<br />It was interesting however, reading his Racial Evolution theory. I don't know if I would agree with it, but it sounds interesting, nonetheless. It is also true, that blacks commit more crimes than whites, and that even black taxi drivers won't pick up blacks.  It is also ironic that we have all this \\"embrace diversity\\" stuff, yet we call whites bigots, simply because we want to preserve our culture.<br />The innacuracies, and the fact that he sounds like Hitler's Mein Kampf, are why I can't give this a higher reading.  However, If you want to understand the mind of Hitler, read Mein Kampf. If you want to understand the mind of Duke, then read this. For now, I will walk on a type rope when listening to extreme liberals and extreme conservatives. Maybe it's the fact that he was a former KKK member that bothered me.	2002-10-06

This is a wonderful book, and shocking being that here is man who was so endowed in Christinaity, and after 35 years of his life walks away from it. He is not telling people how to think, just why he feels a certain way he is correct. Nowhere in this book does he ever tell people what to think; it's impossible to do that in atheism. This book gave me a deeper insight into atheism, because I am already a skeptic. I can relate to many of his experiences... He studied for years to be a preacher. He has written a lot of Christian music that is still selling today. He went on missionaires, and he himself, said he was 100% for sure of Christianity, then later became 100% unsure. ...Read this book with an open mind. Barker is not saying he is better than others, or that he is right. He is merely giving another side to the traditional religious arguments that people believe without question. Even he said that you don't have to agree with him a number of times throughout this book. <br />This book is a challenge to theists, especially statements as \\"Why does life have to have meaning\\" to attacking the popular theist arguments as Pascals Wager to Ontological Argument.  The only reason people are giving this a low rating, is because they are too scared to have their beliefs challenged.  It scares them to realize that a god might not exist, or that their is no heaven  or hell.  <br />Learn to stretch, because if you aren't stretching in life, you arent growing.

Yes, I am a white male, who is fairly conservative, but I am no bigot. I have black friends, and a gay family member. I love them dearly and get along with them fine, and am very in favor of them having equal rights. Did you know that Cheney and Powell are pro-gay rights in their free time? Did you know during the Civil Rights era, more Republicans voted for the Civil Rights bill than did the Southern Democrats? Remember, Lincoln was a Republican, the KKK during the 1800's attacked blacks AND the white republicans, because the Klan wanted to keep the strong Southern Democratic vote.  It's too bad our schools aren't teaching those facts.<br />In fact, Elder is also pointing out that there were Republicans who busted their hump to get blacks equal rights. For example, Nixon was the first one to instate Affirmative Action, and Reagan increased social spending during his administration. <br />Elder is not saying racism doesn't exists. He is just saying that blacks need to look at how far they have come, instead of using past treatments to justify what he calles, \\"Victicrat mentality.\\" Even he admits to being called the \\"N\\" word, but he said we need to not spend our energy on bigots, because that doesn't help us accomplish our goals in life.<br />I think we all suffer, whether we are black or white, gay or straight, woman or man. Calling Elder \\"smart and stupid\\" as one reviewer did, shows that he is having a knee jerk reaction to someone speaking the truth.  Yes, it is interesting as Larry points out that blacks are the first ones to complain about racism, wanting special rights than do so other minorities that come here.  <br />Booker T. Washingtonan African American once said this:  <BR>       \\"There is a class of colored people who make a business of keeping the troubles, the wrongs and the hardships of the Negro race before the public.  Having learned that they are able to make a living out of their troubles, they have grown into the settled habit of advertising their wrongs-partly because they want sympathy and partly because it pays.\\"<br />Congratulations Larry for speaking the truth.

I assume from the first reviewer of this book that he hates to admit that evil has been done in the name of Christianity.  He has a hard time seeing it done today, because we have a seperation of church and state.  Look, this book may come as a shock to many Christian readers, but these are facts we can't deny.  For example, America is a beautiful country, but in our history there is racism (KKK), the Civil War and the brutal murder of gay student, Matt Shepard.  The same goes true for any other organization/country.  What ever has done good, has done bad too.<br />This book provides a very detailed, factual account of people being killed in the name of Christianity from it's inception up to the present.  You read about mennonites (anabaptists) getting executed by Protestants and Catholics, Jews being stripped of their Civil Rights, and everyone else who didn't take Jesus as their saviour.  It is truly sick and stupid that the laws in those days prosecuted someone just because of a difference of opinion, espeically religious.  How gruesome and brutal were Christians to people who differed with them on an opinion?  Well, picture you are a Muslim, and preaching the Koran on the streets of England.  First the government burns your books, since they are not pro-Christian.  Second, you get whipped over 300 times until you have no flesh on your body.  Third offense, you will get your tongue cut off, a \\"B\\" burned into your skin for \\"blasphemer\\", exiled or executed.  Isn't that a good reason, and why our founding fathers established a seperation between church and state?<br />This is a good book, though very long.  But, hey it's a history book, right?	2002-07-24

This is the best book on freethinking that has walked the face of the earth.  Many religious people say his arguments can be figured out by a three year old.  Well, I have a rebuttal: Do we need to read the bible to know we shouldn't kill others?  The more ironic thing, is that the religious conservatives know they have they basis for their claims, and when someone uses facts to prove them wrong, they can't handle it.<br />Paine points out that the Catholic religion was more cruel than the Greek religions.  The reason is because in Greek times, religious people welcomed philsophers and scientists.  In the days of Christianity, the free thinkers and scientists were burned at the stake.  The Age of Reason means you think outside of oppressive thinking, which generally happens to be religion.

One reviewer made the comment: &quot;I want answers!  I can get more answers from a Teen Magazine&quot;  What an ignorant statement, I think.  Because Socrates says that the best knowledge comes from knowing that we know nothing.  The problem with the Bible, is that people think it is all the answers.  It isn't to be expected  to be the answer for everything, just as this book isn't suppose to be the answer for everything.  These are merely theories.<br />What I like about the book is how Socrates thinks we should be good for the sake of it, rather than for what it gets us.  For example, why do we tell our children to be just?  Does being just mean being cruel and cunning underneath, while they are financially successful and appear to be honest?  Socrates claims that the truly just person will be good even though he doesn't always get what he wants in life.  Basically that justice is it's own reward.<br />One thing I agree is that artists, as Socrates says, is that they tend to create illusions.  But, I don't agree that they need to be censored; that's just hogwash.  Nor do I think that a village should raise a child, or that a man should stick to one career his whole life.  In their time, they lived by the authority of the poets, whereas nowadays people go by the Koran or the Bible for their answers.	2002-01-02

He is more a Libertarian in that sense, as well as I am.   <br />Elder points out the resources we waste be fighting the war on drugs.  The government has no right to tell you what you can and can't do with your body, yet they make drugs illegal.  I bet it is probably tied in with money, but they (the burecrats) never point that out.  Eating and spending too much time at your job can put a strain on your family as well.  How come we don't have any so called &quot;War on Working Overtime&quot; or &quot;War on Overeating&quot;?

He got his financial freedom by investing in the stock market, and am sure he has more financial freedom than many MLM people.  <br />Another thing that MLM won't tell you is that there is risk involved with MLM as there is in any business enterprise.  As a distributor you can get terminated, your downline could quit either because they or lazy or they found a better MLM opportunity.  <br />MLM is one option to be self employed, but not money that you can live on.  Some MLM people I know are on the road all the time with MLM, so it's a lot harder than some of them will tell you that it is.	2001-08-12

The reason I have the title &quot;Compeltely Missed the Point&quot; is in response to the reviewer from this August.  Investing a small portion of your job income every month will build up enough passive income so that you won't need to work for a living the rest of your life.<br />By the way, I know some millionaires who special entities so that they have less of it taxed, in order to pass more on to their kids.	2001-08-12

My only problem is that he includes many jokes from Jammin' In New York, Back In Town and earlier ones.  I do think he is a man that I would love to have his thinking...except for the drugs.<br />I will say that somethings I hear him writing are funnier than when I 'hear' him say it.  You have to have a creative imagination.  Like his part on telling golf players to &quot;pick the f---ing ball up!  You're lucky you found the f---ing thing!  Put in your pocket and go home.&quot;  You have to be able to picture George or someone on a golf course telling some old, uppity businessman snobbily telling Carlin to get out of his way, while Carlin tells him a thing or two.  Get it?<br />I would rather be a skeptic like George than blindly follow a lot of the BS that the politicians, Religious Organizations and celebrities tell us.  The reason people find him offensive is that they can't think past his fowl language.  Sure I am offended by some of the jokes he says about the things I do, but he gets you to think on your own.  The only reason he cusses is to add power.  Words are power.  <br />It's like what Henry Ford once said, &quot;Thinking is the Hardest work there is.  That's why so few people do it.&quot;	2001-08-02

I have the confidence to write a book now after reading this. It's already 100 pages long. The key is that YOU NEED TO DO WHAT HE MENTIONS IN THE BOOK!! It's like buying a piece of exercise equiptment and expecting it to take fat off your body without doing any exercising.<br />Even Robert Allen, Walt Disney and GEORGE LUCAS had a ton of rejection. As well, they had to start from somewhere to get money to start their dreams. If they can do it, why can't you? Even if you fail, you'll be steps ahead of the people who don't take action but have the gull to criticize you.   As Yoda told Luke Skywalker &quot;Do or do not.  There is no try.&quot;<br />WIth that said, buy this book and go for it.  What have you got to lose?	2001-06-30

Books	2	39	47	N	N	I'm starting to wonder if he really had a &quot;rich dad&quot;	Now don't get me wrong, but I loved Rich Dad Poor Dad!  That book taught me that it's not the school smarts that get rich, but it's the peristent people that do.  Even Calvin Coolidge said that once.  Also the psychology helped a lot too.<br />But, looking at how this book really didn't say anything different from RDPD, along with all the new &quot;Rich Dad&quot; books, I think that he is just simply capitalizing off a fad.  Think about it!  Isn't a coincidence that all these investing books and people who say &quot;I made a milllion&quot; are popping up all the sudden?  You notice how real estate was the top thing in the 80's and how you rarely(only some infomercials) are seeing anything about real estate?<br />The best finance book that GIVES you technical answers is &quot;Multiple Streams of Income&quot; by Robert Allen.  I would say that reading that along with &quot;Rich Dad Poor Dad&quot;, and take action, that you will do well.  But, after RDPD, I am starting to believe that is starting to test our wits!	2001-06-10

I am surprised when I speak of George Carlin's humor and logic people always say &quot;He has a dirty mouth&quot;.  FOLKS!  LISTEN TO ME AND ESPECIALLY TO GEORGE!  He is trying to get a point across with his humor, which is exactly what comedian Lenny Bruce was doing many years ago.  If all you see is the cussing, then you miss on an opportunity to think.  It's like the old saying &quot;What you see is what you get&quot ...Braindroppings is hiliarious!  I really love his take on religion, politics, and fallacies that many of us seem to believe in.  One line he says is &quot;I don't want something that's good for headahces.  I want something that's bad for headaches and good for me.  As well, I don't want the doctor prescribing me pain pills, I need relief pills&quot;<br />HE also makes fun of euphisms that many of the liberals like to use.  They like conservatives, don't think about what they are doing and as well he thinks the euphisms are a form of lying.  He's absolutely right!  Calling someone cripple versus &quot;differently abled&quot; is crap, as well it is a vague term.  <br />But, I don't want to spoil it for you.  Go ahead and buy this book!  It will put a smile on your face and will get you to start thinking.	2001-05-01

While I do agree with him about cutting up ATM cards, paying cash, I think it is stupid how he sees it stupid to plan for retirement!  If it is so stupid and pointless to plan for residual income, then why the hell did he write this book?  He gets residual income for that!<br />The point of saving and investing your money while you are working is so that you can have the free time to NOT work! IT'S CALLED DELAYED GRATIFICATION, and that is what most people don't have because they think short term.  Most people would rather work hard, spend all their money, and repeat the process rather than use their brain to work hard once and let the investment/residual income support them.<br />Yes it may be based entirely out of fear to want more retirement money, but fear is the same reason people don't want to invest!  The reason I save and invest, involved with MLM/Affiliate programs is because I DON'T WANT to put up with an employer for the rest of my life and it is based out of desire not fear!  If I don't have the residual income, then I don't have a life because I have to work incessently to pay the bills.

I was thinking while reading this book, &quot;This guy is rude&quot;, but he is trying to tell people the hard core facts about MLM.  I just left an MLM that says you can only be a distributor if let the company deduct a certain amount of $ from your bank account every month(it's a long aggravating story!) <br />One reviewer said that Lant is just trying to get people to join his MLM, but he did say that he doesn't believe that people should only join his MLM.  He only said to join after trying many times to get the CEO of the MLM company you are in to follow the techniques he learned the hard way.  Even if you join his, he wants you to review it and to get the &quot;sign up and wait for the quick gauranteed commission checks to pour in&quot; attitude.  He even admits that he made that mistake.<br />According to Lant, you need to find a MLM company that really wants to help distributors, has suggestions, doesn't require you to buy products/pay monthly fees, follows Legal guidelines, and that you need to learn how to keep on top of your downline.<br />He does seem rude, but he even admits that he is very tenacious!  That is what is takes to get what you want out of life.	2000-12-29

I foolsihly thought that the movie was accurate, but this book proves me wrong.  It would have been good for the movie to be just like this book, but of course the show business just wants to make it look good to make a profit!  As well, maybe the movie makers had to change some things around or they would get sued.     If I were going to make a movie about him, I would base it on this book.  The movie was a good movie, but not truly about the real Ritchie Valens...same as the Buddy Holly Story.	2000-10-24

I LOVED rich dad poor dad and cashflow quadrant!!  They gave me a good  insight on the real truth about money and that the school is designed to  train people to make their bosses rich.  But, Rich Dad's Guide To Investing  was nothing new really.  It was the same thing from the first two books,  but rephrased.   Don't get me wrong, I very much agree with Kiyosaki's  first two books and his board game, but this 3rd book is not worth the  money.  Just pick up the advice from his first two books, the game Cashflow  and you'll do fine.	2000-09-06

My brother was killed three years ago and I was so flamed when these ignorant middle aged and old people would say &quot;It's  so hard on the parents&quot; or they even said, &quot;The poor  grandparents&quot;. Hello!  The grandparents do not have the bond with the  grandchild as the siblings do.  Siblings are around with each other more,  so therefore they bond is stronger.  There was a lot of people saying many  other ignorant things, but it would be way to long for me to go into great  detail here about each ignorant comment.  But I feel the most ignorant  comment I hear is &quot;It's only hard on the parents&quot;.    I can't say  that I know what it is like to lose a parent, child or spouse...because I  never have!  That is my complaint with people when they are more concerned  about the parents and even grandparents well-being, than the siblings.  I  ask them, &quot;Why do you think it is not hard for the siblings?&quot; and  they say, &quot;Well,  I never lost a sibling, but I did hear that it's  hard on the parents&quot;.  I say, &quot;No offense, but if you have never  experienced what I have experienced, then you should not go around giving  advice on the subject.&quot;  That is what I want other reviewers who read  my comment to understand...and DO!   For example, if you are not a doctor,  how smart would it be for you to go around giving advice on the medical  field?  Exactly!  I'm serious, if you never have experienced it, then you  just keep quiet.	2000-05-04

I thought Rich Dad Poor Dad was pretty good, because it taught me somethings I never knew and reminded me of where I do and do not want to be in the long term.  Cashflow Quadrant  abolishes the myths about investing and I loved how he seperated the  Employees and Self Employed on the left side and the business owners and  investors on the right side.  I am starting to invest into some mutual  funds, and plan to get educated to sell and invest in real estate.  I know  just about everyone in the world is described well in this book.  For  example, my grandfather is a self employed person and belives it is wrong  to obtain any money through investments.  My dad on the other hand thinks  it is foolish to only rely on a job or being self employed.  I just want a  career and to have most of my money towards investments.  Most of my  co-workers that have gotten fired are in deep trouble because they never  knew or took advantage of the information in this book.  If they have  investment money, then they wouldn't have to be worried about getting  fired.      Buy this book!  If you don't, you will never be aware of  investment opportunities, and will have no choice but to take orders your  whole life.  Remember, what you do with the paycheck in your hand is your  choice.  If you blow it all to consume, then you will be poor.  If you take  the paycheck and put some of it towards investments each time, then you  will be getting out of the rat race quicker.

The man who wrote this book is PURE genius!   I'm only 21 years old, and just by reading this book I feel like I am a million times ahead of the  game compared to professionals who are years older than me!  I have  recently been saving up since reading this book, and I know it will help me  years down the road when I start my own business.    I see nothing  wrong with this book, and anyone who thinks otherwise is exactly the same  kinds of people that Robert Kiyosaki points out in this book. The average  John Doe doesn't understand the concept of investing into a good business.   I quote Mr. Kiyosak, &quot;If you're in a hole, stop digging!&quot; My  great-grandfather had his own business, and told my father,&quot;It's best  to get $1 from many people rather than get $100 from only one person&quot;  He said that at a time in America when people belived that  good grades  made more money... but still people have the same poor &quot;money is  bad&quot; mindset today!  In a class I took last year at college, the  professor asked all of us what we would do if we won $1 million?  Like most  people, everyone in the class said, &quot;I would buy a car, a house, big  stereos, stuff like that&quot;  I can't believe people are that ignorant!   When it was my turn to say what I would do if I won the lottery, I replied,  &quot;I would save it up, and invest it into a business like a fitness  center, apartments in a college town or help my younger brother buy a  guitar shop when he gets older&quot;  Everyone looked at me like I was from  another planet when I said that!  Again, this is the best book on  financial advice I have ever read!   I can't thank Robert Kiyosaki enough  for the advice he gave in this book-he is one of the FEW smartest business  men in the world!   It really has prepared me for the future.	1999-11-05
