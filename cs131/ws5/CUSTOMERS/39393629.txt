I reviewed GETTING THE WORDS RIGHT and gave it 5 stars. It's an excellent book. This one is mostly bad, punctuated with some good tips. The newer edition may be better as it includes some new thoughts and ideas. But theyre not in this edition. And this is the one youre considering. I have 2 problems with this edition: It's mostly quotes of other writer's stuff, AND Cheney's own writing never quite grabs your attention. I mean, I wanted to pay attention! but my mind kept wandering, and my reading was forced. At the end I had no idea what I had read. But Cheney can be excellent.	2005-10-03

It fails all of the important criteria for a good book: It's not well-written, it's not interesting or engrossing, and much of the content is implausible.

A book has to capture my attention: This one does that. And a good book should never break-the-spell with crude interruptions...like gross factual errors, improbable-implausible action, and gross incongruence in the traits of the character's. There are no \\"What in hell was that all about?\\" moments in this book. Brady's experience in Korea is similar to my Vietnam experience, and it's similar to other recollections of Korea. But the bottom-line is: Is this book a \\"keeper\\" for the library? It is.	2005-10-01

There are a very few books on writing that make a significant and immediate impact, and this is one of them. The experience of reading it is like a paradigm-shift of your thinking about how to express yourself clearly and effectively in print. Gunning also researched what makes readers happy and unhappy, turns them on-and turns them off. You would think writers would have mastered the lessons in this book during the fifty-plus years it's been around; but they havent. And once you read this book youll notice awful writing everywhere!

It's certainly as good as Jon Franklin's book, and Franklin's book is excellent. I can't agree more; too much of what gets written is too wordy and has no unity of anything.

This is the best of its type I've come across. I'm impressed. However the author doesnt address how you cope with idiots, and the system is filled with idiots: who run amok over the crime scene, destroying evidence; experts who know little or nothing about what they profess, severely damaging investigations; and political pressure to make certain outcomes likely. People get highly annoyed when your report is contrary to their bias and expectations. And newbie judges and lawyers. They arent scientists and they arent detectives, and they are arrogantly clueless when it comes to much of what you discover. This book is well-written, the author knows his stuff, and it's interesting.	2005-08-09

My chief objection to this book is it perpetuates the myth about \\"Crackers.\\" In 1895 artist-writer Frederic Remington came to Florida and wrote a story about Cracker Cowboys and their whips. The whip part got remembered, and the part about them being rustlers and thieves got forgotten. The Hendry's, especially, had a difficult time with these rustlers, and there were range wars at times. The so-called Cracker Cowboys were hired by powerful and influential interests to steal the cattle. My old man was a rustler! and stole many a herd of cattle here in Florida, but in the 1950s and 60s. Anyway, in the 19th Century Floridians generally regarded \\"Crackers\\" as lazy drunks who made their living stealing chickens & hogs, begging, and hunting. Prince Achille Murat observed that they generally squatted on private land until forced to leave, and I have read where they often camped on town squares and other public places, and made a nuisance of themselves.Crackers were at the bottom of the social order in Florida. Most Floridians did not consider themselves to be Crackers in those days. Today these Crackers would be called \\"trailer-trash\\" or \\"homeless.\\" And throughout the 19th Century Floridians made fun of them and ridiculed their ways. And it's all there in the periodicals and newspapers of those times. But the book is interesting, otherwise, and excellent when the author writes about what she knows.	2005-08-02

It was interesting for the first half and became tiresome afterwards. I didnt find it difficult to read at all. And I learned a few things. But the self-promotion is poorly concealed, and I'm not sure why the reader needs to know Maples drives a Cadillac and makes major bucks. Another turn-off is his whining about others who are involved in his investigations. I have to cope with morons every day. It's part of the job. To correct and work around their blunders. But the book is a fair primer of the vocation.	2005-07-26

The book resonates with my own experiences, and those related to me by kinsmen from the very same communities, at or about the same times as the author writes of. A few of the names I've heard before. And I'm familiar with the places. But more importantly, the book depicts times and places and peoples who are no more. Floridians and Georgians have lost their independence and self-reliance, and this is what the book is about....confronting life as it is and accepting whatever ration God gives you. It's an excellent example of what modern times have cost us.	2005-07-26

Crackers were NOT the colorful common folk of Florida. Crackers were NOT Florida cowboys with whips. 'Crackers' were the bottom of the white social order in 19th Century Florida. Achille Murat, an early pioneer of Florida, said of them, \\"poor citizens, generally not very industrious who, not possessing the means of buying lands, live upon those of others, and work them until they are expelled by the proprietors. Their poverty is entirely the fruit of their idle and drunken habits.....every dispute is amicably terminated by the fist.\\" 'Crackers' were vagrants and drunks and poachers and thieves and beggars. So the authors need to re-consider the title of their book. No self-respecting Floridians of the 19th Century would think of themselves as 'Crackers.\\" The white-trash were 'Crackers.'	2005-07-25

I also like the fact that events and people in the book are plausible and reflect my own experiences of the war and Vietnam. In short, the book is pretty good entertainment. On the other-hand I tend to be impatient with \\"Tortured Warriors\\" filled with angst about their experiences in the war, and Mr.Brennan treats us to a full ration of his angst and self-pity.

The cops I know try to bust tourists taking photos of the cruise boats at the docks, or slam old ladies against walls at the airport, or drive around in squad cars marked SEAT BELT ENFORCEMENT UNIT.

It's written well and interesting and plausible. But Schneider needs a punch in the nose for his attitude about the Air Force. Schneider! Airmen by necessity are REMFs. You cannot repair, maintain, and arm aircraft in the boonies. It's all high-tech. The aircraft were for your benefit, not our's. All of us worked 12 hour days, and 6 day weeks. We also repaired a few tanks and other army vehicles, to help the grunts out. Our food tasted like @#$%& and our toilets were generally overflowing with the same. We stole C-Rations from the army because it was better than what we were fed. And we were mortared and attacked. So get-over it. But your book is pretty good otherwise.	2005-07-04

I mean, it's well written and interesting, but the information about NecroSearch is a distracting digression that imposes itself upon otherwise interesting murders.

To get my 5 STARS the book has to be one I'll keep and read again a few times because it's so outstanding. But this is an interesting and enjoyable book. I call it a 'motel book' or 'cruise book.' Trust me, you can do alot worse. And I looked forward to reading it from the beginning. On the other-hand I work in law enforcement and I dont know anyone like Dave Carbone. Maybe it's just where I live, but around here the detectives step on their private parts more often than not, and it's frustrating to watch cases go up in smoke because of dum detectives and dummer judges.

When you consider how the government and American People conspired to send its sons to war and tied their hands in the actual combat. It was the worst kind of treachery that demands: You go and fight, and I'll hold your coat, your horse, and your weapon.<br /><br />My only problem with the book is there is too much combat action. Over-kill. It ruined the balance and the mix.	2005-02-21

I give it 4 stars because I never met any officer in Vietnam, or anywhere else, like Kirschke describes himself. And I certainly didnt meet any Kirschke's in Vietnam.

The book would be much better if the good doctor didnt whine so much. He's whines about everything. And when he isnt whining he's kissing David Hackworth's butt. I mean, I wanted to cry when the poor-baby doctor was compelled by the evil army to treat grunts rather than continue his medical education in a rear-area hospital. And when Doc Poor-Baby finally became a REMF, he whined about that, too.<br /><br />Poor-Baby, MD whines about the endless hours of work yet has the time to write long, detailed letters to his girl-friend every day. This makes me suspicious of his veracity.<br /><br />Officers of every stripe had lives of comparative ease and comfort in Vietnam. And they pulled 6 months in combat zones, not 12 like the grunts.	2005-02-03

I was at Phan Rang for part of the time Carl Adams was there. His book comes across as the Real McCoy. Vietnam airbases get very little coverage, and it was delightful to discover Carl's book. I bought one copy for me and a copy for another PRABite. I worked with the dog handlers on a few occasions and vividly recall the dog's interest in devouring me as we rode along in the same jeep in the \\"Juliet\\" sector. It's a toss-up as to which was the worst threat...the dog...or sitting inside a canary yellow flood-light cart out on the perimeter at night, trying to keep it running. Carl writes well and illuminates an aspect of the Vietnam experience that doesnt get the credit it deserves...the Air Force Security Police.	2004-10-22

It will absorb your attention and it's rarely dull. On the other-hand its style reminds me of the W.E.B.Griffin Action-Hero books. Everything and everyone in the book is \\"too this\\" and \\"too that.\\" The book is autobiographical. Krekorian depicts himself as the best there ever was...Best Surgeon, Best Commander, Best Husband, Best Friend...Best (fill in the blank). Everyone in the book is a Superhero or a Super-villain. There is no grey. I wondered for a moment if Krekorian and W.E.B.Griffin were separated at birth, but discounted the idea when I further reflected that Krekorian probably had the perfect childhood. But it's not a bad book if you like W.E.B.Griffin, and I don't question the author's basic honesty. There likely are mortals like Ed Krekorian out there in the world...somewhere.	2004-10-21
US	39393629	R24RQ5RLJPGL9L	0743225252	409334755	The Yearling	Books	5	8	9	N	N	A Cracker Classic	I'm a 7th generation Floridian though not a Cracker. Cracker's in the Olden Times lived on the edge pretty much like the Baxter's did in this 1870s tale. Life in the Florida \\"scrub\\" was always difficult and always a challenge. Sugar-sand, pines,and palmettos. Crackers existed by hunting, foraging, fishing, theft, and farming enough corn to take care of their most basic needs. Killing a deer who eats your corn was the reality, killing a bear who slaughters your calf was the reality. Killing a neighbor who poached your hog was the reality. Because these kinds of insults to your welfare could not be tolerated, and Crackers had no luxuries or slack to draw upon when emergencies came along. Root hog! or die! This is what the book is about: Making the transformation from a child-like innocence of life, to a mature acceptance of the harsh realities of living. Many adults never make the change. Rawlings elevates and enobles the Baxters somewhat; in reality they would have been coarse and crude and unsympathetic characters, hardened by a life of hard-times. But the book is about becoming an adult and setting aside childish things and ways. Excellent writing and absorbing story.	2004-10-21
