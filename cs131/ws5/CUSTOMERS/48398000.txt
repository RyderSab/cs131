The new prequel to the \\"Left Behind\\" series by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins is nothing short of phenomenal. Though it isn't as powerful as some of the previous novels in the series (Including the emotionally-charged conclusion, \\"Glorious Appearing\\"), \\"The Rising\\" is compelling nonetheless.<br /><br />The parts dealing with Marilena Carpathia and the birth of Nicolae are genuinely frightening. It felt as if Satan was in the room with me as I read this part. I had to stop every now and then to pray that this wouldn't take a hold of me. It was THAT scary at times.<br /><br />Nicolae's story runs parallel with the story of Rayford Steele. We see him as he grows up, and becomes strongly against God and religion, while chasing his dreams of becoming an airline pilot, marries Irene, and raises his children. His story is told with the humor, emotion, and excitement that we have come to expect from LaHaye and Jenkins.<br /><br />\\"The Rising\\" is riveting stuff that will chill you to the bone, and will challenge anyone's beliefs. I highly recommend it!<br /><br />Grade: A+	2005-07-29

When I first read this novel back in 1998 (A hundred years after the novel had been written), I was expecting a good horror novel. What I got was a powerful novel of faith and hope within the story of a Martian invasion. Mankind is powerless against these invaders, their weapons useless. But in the end, Mankind wins anyway, thanks to the Master of Heaven and Earth. H.G. Wells' novel is a masterpiece that deserves a place in everyone's collection of great science fiction!

It has been nearly six years since I read this book, but it's tragic look at America's treatment of the Native Americans has lingered with me ever since. It is a look at how \\"manifest destiny,\\" the belief that Anglo-American expansion was decreed by God, lead to, among other things:<br /><br />-The seizing of Indian lands;<br /><br />-The raping and murdering of women and children;<br /><br />-The futile attempts by the Indians to stop this conquest, and;<br /><br />-The forced relocation of Native Americans to \\"Indian Reservations,\\" a similar process that Hitler used on the Jews during the Holocaust.<br /><br />The cruel and barbaric treatment of the Native Americans in the nineteenth century the is still the greatest sin America has ever committed, and one from which it will never be free from. \\"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\\" is a powerful and tragic book that shows how the need for power and expansion leads to the destruction of those who, according to some, \\"stand in the way of progress.\\" I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Grade: A+	2005-06-15

Clarke's \\"2061: odyssey three\\" is the third installment in one of the most successful science-fiction book series ever written. While the narrative doesn't flow as steady as it did in the previous two entries, it is still a fascinating novel with great and unusual characters. The novel also captures both the loneliness of men stranded on another world, as well as the fears of those who are coming to their rescue, wondering if they'll get there in time, or if the planet's population will pose a threat to them.<br /><br />The main story of a rescue mission sent to retrieve a crashed ship from Europa is told with great attention to detail. But then, we soon learn, that there is more to this story than just a \\"rescue mission,\\" as it is all part of a plan to involve a part of humanity in the evolution of Europa, whether they wish to or not.<br /><br />\\"2061: odyssey three\\" is a great adventure tale that takes us back to the moons of Jupiter (or Lucifer, as in the case of this story), and should satisfy both the \\"Space Odyssey\\" fans and fans of all science-fiction.

Most moving is his account of the extermination of the family camp, all of whom died bravely.<br /><br />\\"Eyewitness Auschwitz\\" is riveting storytelling that will keep you engaged from the beginning to the end.

Jim Garrison's powerful book, \\"On the Trail of the Assassins,\\" is important reading. In it, Garrison recounts his investigation into the assassination of President John F.

It questions the validity of the Warren Commission Report, and provides startling evidence that the Central Intelligence Agency may have been involved, and that Kennedy's assassination was a coup d'etat. The evidence Garrison presents leaves little room for doubt.<br /><br />If there wasn't a conspiracy involved to assassinate Kennedy, then why does the U.S. government, OUR government, withold information in connection to the assassination?

Although this book was a good read when I used it as the basis for a paper in seventh grade, I reread it again after studying more about \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, and found this to be very inaccuarate. Either Bronwyn Mills did not study that much about him, or she read all the \\"Politically Correct\\" info about him. Some of the inaccuracies I noticed:<br />1) The book states that General Richard S. Ewell was killed at Second Manassas. In truth, Ewell was wounded, and lost a leg. This is false because Ewell took command of half of Jackson's Corps after his death, and his command led to disaster at Gettysburg.<br />2) The book states that Cavalry General J.E.B. Stuart was killed on May 12, two days after Jackson. In truth, Stuart did die on that date, but it was May 12, 1864, over two YEARS after Jackson's death.<br />3) The book suggested that Jackson was for slavery, and felt that the blacks were a bunch of murderous types. This is totally false! Jackson was very uncompfortable with slavery. But his beliefs were that everything was a part of God's will, and knew that slavery would be abolished, but in God's time. One thing not mentioned much is the fact that Jackson sent in funds to aid in the creation of a Sunday School for African Americans, and he regularly went there to see how things were going, and even joined in prayer services there.<br />In short, this book mostly conforms to the \\"Politically Correct\\" version of \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson.

Grant fought under seperate flags in a fight for the future of the United States, they fought under the same flag in the name of Manifest Destiny in Mexico! GODS AND GENERALS takes the reader to a time thirteen years before the American Civil War, back when the men who would lead two seperate American armies in a fight to preserve the Union led men under the United States flag in an attempt to gain more land for America. Once again, Jeff Shaara gives us an enlightening look at war, cleverly taking us back to the Mexican War. He has made us care for these men like no one ever has! Santa Anna, whom I always pictured as a very evil person, has been presented as a man with ideas of his own, not evil ones, just different ones! And the myths about Robert E. Lee are finally being put aside, and Lee is now being presented in novels not just as an officer, but as a human being as well! Anyone who enjoyed THE CIVIL WAR TRILOGY (THE KILLER ANGELS, GODS AND GENERALS, and THE LAST FULL MEASURE) will enjoy this one! I guarantee it! Grade: A+	2002-02-01

THE LAST FULL MEASURE may never live up to THE KILLER ANGELS, but this novel is compelling in it's own right. As Michael Shaara was able to do with the battle of Gettysburg, Jeff Shaara puts us on an emotional and spiritual level with the men who fought in the last two years of the Civil War and beyond, while once again making sure that the real-life events are told with almost 100% accuracy! You're with Robert E. Lee on his death bed; you're with Joshua Lawerence Chamberlain as his men storm the defenses of Petersburg; and you're with U.S. Grant at Cold Harbor. Jeff is a fine novelist, and his father's legacy will never be forgotten! Followed by the novels GONE FOR SOLDIERS and RISE TO REBELLION, all of which were preceded by Jeff's first novel, GODS AND GENERALS! Grade: A+	2002-01-05

The novel not only puts you into the bloodiest battle on American soil, but the novel also puts a human face on the well-known characters, as well as staying almost 100% accurate to the real events.* Michael Shaara proves that he is one of the greatest authors of our time. This is a must read for anyone who loves excitement, drama, and history. Followed by GODS AND GENERALS, THE LAST FULL MEASURE, and GONE FOR SOLDIERS, all three written by Shaara's son, Jeff. Grade: A+<br />*Ronald F. Maxwell almost copied the story 100% for GETTYSBURG,<br />the acclaimed film version of THE KILLER ANGELS.	2001-12-31

It has everything you'd like to read in a  novel: action, suspense, romance, and comedy. It sticks close to the movie,  adding only little differences and a little more bad language (which it  could have done without). This and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; are the  best war novels ever written.	2000-09-14
