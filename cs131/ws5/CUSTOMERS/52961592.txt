With the publication of this book, Word have completed the best commentary on Deuteronomy in a century.  Samuel Driver's legendary commentary will still be useful for occasional reference, but for most purposes it is finally superseded by this one.  It is in the standard Word commentary format, so users of the series will know what to expect.  Particularly useful is the discussion about the impact of the Dead Sea Scrolls, found long after Driver's death.	2002-05-27

Mathematics intrudes into his children's books, especially Sylvie and Bruno.  There is nobody better qualified to explain this side of Lewis Carroll to the non-mathematician than Martin Gardner, author of the Annotated Alice and for many years the compiler of the Mathematical Puzzles column in Scientific American.  This book will delight Carroll's many fans and may intrigue many who would not normally be attracted to children's fiction.  I also recommend the two books on Lewis Carroll's puzzles by Edward Wakeling; as a professional mathematician, he brings a complementary perspective.	2002-01-08

However, it has in miniature most of the good features of his larger work.  As expected from this author, he marshals strong arguments against the Documentary Hypothesis but does not adopt a fundamentalist position on Mosaic authorship.  While not such a must have as the two completed volumes on Genesis, it is still valuable.	2002-01-08

As is expected from this author, his aim &quot;is to seek to interpret the book of Exodus as canonical scripture within the theological discipline of the Christian church&quot; (which means, of course, his version of theology).  This may disconcert those who do not agree with his precise shade of liberal evangelism, especially in the sections headed &quot;New Testament Context&quot;.  However, once this hurdle is overcome, this book is packed with useful information.  There are few if any thorough textual and philological studies of Exodus, and the notes here are probably the best available on these topics.  The sections headed &quot;Literary and Traditio-Historical Analysis&quot; discuss (among other things) the Documentary Hypothesis, but Childs is not overly concerned with this aspect since he is more interested in the canonical form of Exodus.  The most valuable parts are the &quot;Old Testament Context&quot;, which discuss the meaning of the text and its relationship to the rest of the Old Testament.  These sections, plus the extensive textual and philological notes, constitute an excellent commentary on Exodus and fully justify buying this book.  The other parts can easily be ignored if you disagree with them.	2002-01-03

Most of the historical background is obsolete and best ignored.  It adopts an extremely critical stance, much of which is discredited and even quaint.  However, the book is not yet worthless, because it has a still unrivalled analysis of the Hebrew grammar and an extensive treatment of textual variants from the Septuagint and elsewhere.  Don't throw it away, but supplement it with a couple of newer works, such as the three volume magnum opus of Westermann.	2001-12-25

This book is essential reading for anyone who wants to know what the Hebrew really means.  There is also a lot of helpful background material (though after nearly 40 years this is no longer up to date) and thoughtful analysis.  Speiser was no fundamentalist, and was often prepared to say that the text is not to be taken literally, but he was less &quot;critical&quot; than many authors.  He believed firmly in the Documentary Hypothesis, and each passage is carefully dissected into its J, E and P components, but this material can be ignored by anyone (including myself) who rejects that hypothesis.  There is probably no single commentary that would suffice for a detailed study of Genesis, but this book should be one of the commentaries at hand for the serious student.	2001-12-25

This may well have been true in 1926 when it was first published.  However, it is far from true today.  In the last 80 years, a flood of new light has been cast on the Old Testament by archaeology, comparative linguistics and other disciplines.  This has improved the understanding of every book, and of Job more than most.  (Ironically, Dhorme did as much as anyone to render his own book out of date; his decipherment of Ugaritic, a language similar to Hebrew, led to a flood of new light on the grammar and vocabulary of Job.)  Thus, while this book still has value and is a model of how a commentary should be written, it has been superseded by more recent commentaries (notably &quot;The Book of Job&quot; and &quot;The Book of God and Man&quot; by Robert Gordis).	2001-12-24

It can thus take no account of the enormous strides in Biblical research in recent decades.  Anyone studying the Book of Esther would need to get some more recent publications.  However, this book is not yet superseded and should not be neglected by the serious student.  For example, its study of text criticism and the value of the various Greek translations for that purpose is still unmatched.  Some readers will be put off by Paton's view that there is little or no historical value in Esther, but this attitude can easily be ignored and the book used for its valuable material.  In summary: use this book with care, supplement with more recent books, but don't ignore it.	2001-12-24

Collins believes that Daniel himself had no hand in writing the book, but that it was the product of the age of the Maccabean struggle.  However, he presents all the evidence and arguments fully, being fair to those of a more conservative viewpoint.

It offers a complete list of comets and possible cometary sightings up to 1799; for each comet he summarises the available observations.  The author has made extensive searches through Chinese, Babylonian and European sources, many of which are hard to come by.  Many of the earlier entries are very short and repetitive, but that's the nature of the scanty observations.  He quotes orbital elements whenever they are available; he is undiscriminating here, as many of these elements are so dubious that they are excluded from the standard catalogues.  The nature of the observations changes dramatically over time, from quaint references to broom stars to careful telescopic observations by great observers like Messier and Herschel.  It will be interesting to see if Kronk can keep up the same standard in later volumes when more recent comets, observed with ever more sophisticated equipment and even space probes, must be discussed.	2001-11-19

However, when using this book, you must always allow for his biases.  He is quite explicit about them: \\"I represent an evangelical approach to the Old Testament, and, accordingly, give high marks to good commentaries that come from a similar perspective.\\"  He does add \\"I can appreciate and learn from writers who write from a perspective different than my own\\", and indeed sometimes recommends books by Catholic or Jewish authors, but that does not mean that he is prepared to rate highly, or even acknowledge the existence of, all books with a different perspective.  For example, there is no mention in this book of the excellent and widely acclaimed (Roman Catholic) New Jerome Commentary nor of the (Jewish) Soncino, ArtScroll or Judaica Press commentaries.    Many books that he considers \\"critical\\" get short shrift.  If he bothers to list them at all, he gives them only one or two stars, and rates them \\"S\\" (only for Scholars) even if they are of a more popular level.  Examples of this include Soggin's \\"Introduction to the Old Testament\\" and Wevers' Ezekiel.  (To be fair, there are exceptions, such as Zimmerli's Ezekiel.)  It would take too much room to list other books that have poor reviews or are omitted.    Commentaries on Daniel show this effect most clearly.  Hartman & Dilella's and Porteous' commentaries both get very poor reviews.  The one by Collins is rightly praised despite being \\"critical in its approach\\".  However, it is the one by Goldingay that is hailed as \\"perhaps the most comprehensive commentary on Daniel listed here\\".  This is a fine book, but it offers far less material than Collins.    It has been said that Longman's favourable review of Hamilton's Genesis shows his tolerance of people with different views.  However, Hamilton is a fellow evangelical.  Their theological differences, such as they are, would not show up nearly so strongly in Genesis as in say Daniel.  For Genesis, his tolerance would be shown by better assessments of the commentaries by von Rad or Speiser (he admits that the latter is a \\"must-buy\\" for the scholar yet he rates it only S**!), or the inclusion of the one by Meir Zlotowitz    In summary, this book must be used with great caution by anyone who does not share Longman's prejudices.	2001-10-17

The opening part of Genesis is among the most difficult and misinterpreted sections of the Bible; Cassuto is a sure guide, explaining difficulties and resolving apparent discrepancies.  He is a firm opponent of the Documentary Hypothesis, rebutting its arguments comprehensively.  On the other hand, he never falls into the trap of slavish fundamentalist interpretation.

Some of these old volumes still have value today.  Here is a new volume in this great tradition, the result of 15 years' work by a great scholar.  In this densely packed book, made even denser by the use of small print for the more technical sections, you will find nearly everything worth saying about this &quot;minor&quot; prophet.  MacIntosh casts a powerful new light on the text of Hosea by showing that many of the hard to understand passages can be explained by realising that Hosea spoke a Northern dialect of Hebrew rather than the dialect of Jerusalem.  At a stroke, he clears up difficulties that have perplexed his predecessors for generations and caused William Harper (author of an earlier ICC commentary on Hosea) to propose dozens of amendments to the text; MacIntosh shows that these are mostly unnecessary.  However, he does find evidence of some editorial activity and explanatory glosses added by priestly circles in Jerusalem.  In summary, this book is hard going, but those willing to persevere will find one of the very best commentaries ever written on a minor prophet, and a book that holds its place among the best commentaries on any Bible book.	2001-10-16

(The first, by his nephew, appeared in the year of his death.)  Reed was able to talk to many people who knew Carroll, including several close relatives, and even to the sexton who buried him, so this book is a significant source of information.  Reed includes several interesting letters from Carroll (some, amazingly, not reprinted in Carroll's collected letters) and photos.  On the down side, Reed's speculations are often more nonsensical than anything Carroll wrote.  This book probably started the myth that Carroll had a split personality - the lecturer in mathematics from Oxford being somehow detached from the writer of children's stories.

Indeed, there is disagreement about the meaning of the word &quot;canonical&quot;; I take it to mean divinely inspired and fitted to be treated as part of scripture.  A related problem is when the canon was closed, so that no further books could be added and, equally, none could be removed.  There is a vast store of evidence on these questions in the Rabbinic writings from 1300 to 1900 years ago.  However, the information is very difficult for the non-initiated reader to understand.  Sid Leiman, a master in his field, has extracted all the relevant evidence and provides a thorough explanation.  The book is not easy going, and may require two or three readings before you can grasp all of its rich store of information, but do persevere if you are interested in this subject.	2001-07-30

This was a reaction to the Roman Catholic doctrine that the teachings of the Church are as important as the Bible.  Catholics point out an obvious problem with the Protestant position: the list of books, or canon, is itself a tradition, and indeed for the Old Testament the Protestant and Catholic canons differ.  Beckwith seeks to obviate that problem by arguing that the Old Testament canon was firmly fixed before the time of Jesus in a form identical to the current Protestant one, that Jesus endorsed this canon and therefore it has divine sanction.  This book is thus polemical.  Beckwith marshals a vast amount of evidence, and this gives the book some value, but he is biased and selective.  Further, whenever he comes to a difficulty that he cannot overcome, he blithely dismisses it.  For example, faced with the substantial additional material in the Catholic versions of Esther and Daniel compared with the Protestant ones, he does not attempt to show that the canon consisted of the Protestant versions of these books.  Instead, he calls this a problem of textual criticism rather than canon.  Textual criticism deals with odd differences of words, maybe the occasional whole verse added or omitted, but never with the addition of several extra chapters!  Beckwith's other fault is that he has long digressions on matters of at best marginal relevance.  In summary, you can admire the erudition in this book, but treat everything it says with great caution unless you can check it.	2001-07-27

He includes everything from textual criticism to his controversial canonical criticism (see his book &quot;Introduction to the Old Testament As Scripture&quot;).  The latter means, in this case, that he does not deny that the book can be split into Isaiahs 1, 2 and 3 but he dismisses it as irrelevant and concentrates on the book as part of scripture.

His commentaries on Samuel and Deuteronomy are still well worth reading; indeed, they are still unsurpassed in some aspects.  Why is this book different?  Firstly, Driver died before finishing it; most of the general commentary, and much of the &quot;philological notes&quot; (which occupy half the book), were by G B Gray.  While he was a fine scholar, he was not quite in Driver's league.  Secondly, Job is probably by far the most difficult book in the Bible to deal with.  It is written in complex, allusive poetry which even Driver could not understand.  In the last 80 years, a flood of new light has been cast on the Old Testament by archaeology, comparative linguistics and other disciplines.  This has improved the understanding of every book, but Job has benefited far more than Deuteronomy and Samuel.

I would not suggest that this should be the only commentary on Daniel that you buy.  If you want only one at this level of technicality, I suggest the one by J J Collins; it is far more recent and easier to read.  However, I recommend that you get this one as well, because Montgomery was a master of his craft.  His discussion of the Greek versions of Daniel, for example, has not yet been superseded and is still well worth studying.  Have both on your bookshelf, and you will know nearly everything that is worth knowing about the Book of Daniel.	2001-06-06

Although first published nearly 100 years ago, it is a font of information still not readily available elsewhere and remains the finest available commentary on Deuteronomy.  Of course, it must be used with some caution, but it has stood the test of time remarkably well.  For chapters 1-11, there are commentaries by Duane Christensen and Moshe Weinfeld, and Christensen's commentary on the rest of Deuteronomy should appear soon, but Driver will still retain some value for the foreseeable future.	2001-05-08

The author has compared many translations of Isaiah, into English, French, German and other European languages.  Whenever these translations differ in their interpretation of a passage and the author considers that this is due to translators' disagreements about the original Hebrew text of Isaiah, he discusses the merits of the different implied textual variants.  Thus this book is essential reading for anyone puzzled by the differences between the Authorised (King James) Version and more recent translations, or between two modern translations.  There are two sorts of omission, however.  He only refers to passages where he thinks that there is genuine uncertainty about the text, so he omits the famous debate about whether a virgin or a young woman will have a baby, presumably taking this to be a problem in interpretation not textual criticism.  Also, he ignores places where there are interesting variants in the Septuagint or Dead Sea Scrolls but all of the translations he has consulted agree with the Massoretic text.  Despite these omissions, this is a very worthwhile book and future volumes in the series will be welcome.	2001-05-03

However, even without that I would have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone who uses X-11.  The authors have a profound knowledge of the workings of this complex program.  They give a detailed and comprehensive description of what X-11 does and some explanation of why it does it.  Thus the book will be invaluable to all X-11 users, and it should be in the library of every statistical office that uses X-11.  What it does not really cover is how to use the voluminous output from X-11 to ensure that the seasonal adjustment is optimal.  I hope that the authors will write a sequel covering that ground, but in the meantime buy this anyway.	2001-04-30

It is far more comprehensive and easy to understand than Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensis (BHS).  Particularly valuable is the essay on the lengths of the lives of the patriarchs from Adam to Abraham, where the Massoretic text, LXX and Samaritan pentateuch differ.  Unlike BHS, Hendel presents his favoured reconstruction of the original text, rather than reproducing the Massoretic Text and confining amendments to footnotes.  Many will find this preferable.  However, it is not such an original approach as Hendel claims, having been used by Ball in the Polychrome Bible (oddly omitted from the list of references).  A strange gap is that whereas Hendel lists even trivial variants from a handful of Hebrew manuscripts, he totally omits even major variants from all other Hebrew manuscripts.  While most scholars argue that mediaeval Hebrew variants have little value, a selection of the most important ones would be of interest.	2001-04-05

It serves that function superbly, but it is also one of the best books ever written on the textual criticism of the Hebrew Bible.  It is well worth buying even if you do not have a Biblia Hebraica.  Some may prefer Tov's book on the subject, but ideally you should have both.	2001-01-15

For those people who understand what this means  and are interested, this book is quite valuable.  It gives much useful  information from a variety of sources, some of which are very difficult to  access.<br />Despite the review by Freedman, the fact that it cites the Snaith  Bible is not a problem since Mynatt only uses it as an alternative Hebrew  bible to BHS and it would not affect his argument if he had used the  Letteris Bible.	2000-01-19

It prints the text from the 10th century Aleppo codex, plus variants from the  Septuagint, Vulgate, Dead Sea Scrolls, Talmud, other Rabbinic sources and  several mediaeval manuscripts.

Orlinsky is one of the  greatest ever bible translators - he was also involved with two other major  translations, the RSV and the NRSV.  While it would not be difficult to  find a few places where I would have translated differently, on balance  this translation is as good as any now available and better than most.	1998-08-28
