Has she seen his wife? The man reports his wife missing to the Belfast Maine Police, but the man's story is full of holes. Did his wife really disappear or is something more sinister afoot? <br /> <br />Enter Hannah Gray, investigator/counselor. The police have asked her for her help in the crime. And as it happens, the missing woman is a friend of Hannah. While plunging into the disppearance of her friend, Hannah is embroiled the construction of the House from Hell. Will the problems with her contractors and the building site ever end? Will the true story of the missing Victoria ever come to light? <br /> <br />Based on a true crime that still remains officially unsolved, Evora Jordan's tale moves along smoothly. Unlike some mystery tales, Hannah Gray never seems to be a gimmick or a bundle of quirks posing as a person. Hannah could be the lady next door or the person in front of you at the grocery store. Some passages recall Ann Rule with the attention to detail and the lives of everyone involved in a missing persons/crime investigation. Small things like Hannah's love of a good McDonalds breakfast sandwich or the dedicted bargain shopper's experience at Deny's.  <br /> <br />A attentive and clever reader may figure out the who and wheres before the end but Tainted Sand will not be a tainted read.	2004-10-27

Becky's got a half-sister Jessica thanks to Mr Bloomwood's premarriage adventures. But the biggest shocker isn't the long-lost sister, but the mere fact that Jess loves her beloved rocks more than shopping.  <br /> <br />The fourth volume (yes, it has been 4 Shopaholic books) moves along rather smoothly. There's not the same I am Becky, Becky is me (aka addicted to shopping) feeling as in volumes one and two.

And what made this particular author a sensation? The young woman in question was Phillis Wheatley, an African slave writing poetry in English. Her slender books of poems was a literary first, causing critics to mutter. <br />Brought before an panel of eighteen learned gentleman of the time, Phillis Wheatley proved that persons of African descent could think, read and write works of literature. For a few brief years, Phillis was a author known to both the colonies and Europe, think Oprah, think Alice Walker, think Maya Angelou of her day. Sadly, with Revolution at hand, her literary career stumbled with Phillis and her only surviving child dying much too young.<br />But that was not the end of Phillis Wheatley. Her surviving works have endured and been subjected to levels of awe and loathing in the centuries since her death. In some camps, Phillis Wheatley is a mother of the slave narrative, in others a sell-out, an Aunt Thomasina making her then masters happy. <br />Author Henry Louis Gates, Jr does a wonderful job of looking at the literary life of a much loved and much reviled author. The only jarring point? The covers of this fine volume are much too close together, THE TRIALS OF PHILLIS WHEATLEY was a quick read and I found myself sad to have the book end.	2003-08-08

However not everyone's efforts are worth the time to read or the money spent. Luckily, Emily W. Leider is one of a rare breed, a writer who truly respects her subjects. DARK LOVER: THE LIFE AND DEATH OF RUDOLPH VALENTINO doesn't give into the all too easy route of sexy gossip combined with careless writing.<br />Rudolph Valentino, like Leider's previous subject Mae West, radiated sex, sin and sensuality from the silver screen even to this day. DARK LOVER explores Valentino's youth in Italy, his early years in America, his peak as a Hollywood love god and his tragic death at the age of 31. <br />Under the costumes and behind the smoldering eyes was a man seeking love and family even as he make some disasterous life choices. Case in point, Valentino's two marriages to women who for their own reasons were light years away from the Madonna of the Hearth Valentino longed for. <br />The end result is a beautifully researched and fully fleshed portrait. Even buying DARK LOVER for the pictures alone is well worth the cover price for the evolution from gawky Italian boy to Hollywood legend.<br />If you have an unlimited book budget or save your pennies for books, DARK LOVER is a must have for the Hollywood fanatic.	2003-07-31

Not even my least attended event went as badly as the ones in \\"Gossip Hound\\". Grace IS the Publicity Department at tiny publisher Hatto & Hatto whose books seem to be destined for the remainder tables as soon as author signs a contract.<br />The Hatto & Hatto authors are a mixed bunch from the diva who thinks she is Danielle Steel to the poor gent behind \\"Sucking Stones\\". The novel is littered with disasterous publicity events including one where \\"Sucking Stones\\" is mistaken for being true stories of rock and roll groupies.<br />As Grace toils away and deals with mystery author whose works is being pushed on her by an exotic new maid, journalistic vixen Belinda is working her way to the top with the aid of her massive bosom.<br />Okay, so the plot is predictable.

Some have revealed horror stories of horrid abuse, neglect and alienation.<br />A person could be tempted to lump &quot;Uncommon Knowledge&quot; with the rest. But that would be doing Judy Lewis and her story a grave injustice. Unlike other Hollywood children, Judy Lewis entered the world in shadow circumstances that are still debated to this day. <br />In 1935, a blue eyed, blonde baby girl was born to Gretchen Young and her married former lover. Gretchen was better known to the world as the film star Loretta Young and her former lover was the smoldering Clark Gable. Compelled to save her career and image at any cost and her strong Catholic faith barring abortion, the young mother chose to hide her pregnancy and child from the world.<br />Judy Lewis was the baby girl. To the world, she was the adopted daughter and beloved daughter of Loretta Young. To the film world, she was Gable and Young's secret love child, the truth of her heritage stamped on her face. Lewis herself never knew the truth until adulthood. <br />Written without the consent of her mother, Judy Lewis builds a strong case for her story. The photos scattered throughout the text show a young woman to an adult, her resemblance to Clark Gable radiating in every pore. Other photos reveal her close resemblance to the Young family.<br />Like many other Hollywood children, Lewis was subjected to more nannies than time with her mother. And the complete silence from Young in regards to Judy's &quot;adoption&quot; and who she &quot;truly&quot; was left a heartwrenching void in Judy's life, one that even years of working as a family counseler can not erase.	2003-05-08

Gloria Swanson exuded something special from every inch of her tiny frame. Unfortunately if Gloria Swanson is known at all today, it is for her role as Norma Desmond in &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; and too many people assume Gloria was Norma in real-life.<br />Her very candid autobiography reveals a women who was more than just a clotheshorse. Her formal education was limited but like Joan Crawford who came after her, Gloria never stopped learning. Like many film stars, she endured a string of unhappy marriages and paid the price for her fame and career literally in blood.<br />But there is much happiness in her life. Swanson was the mother of three children, an avid advocate of natural medicines and healthful living with a keen interest in the arts. <br />Sadly, Gloria Swanson has passed on and her book is not readily available in the major bookstores. The time taken to obtain a copy for your own is well worth the price.	2003-05-04

Her rise from unknown to Queen of Cosmetics is told in a lively fashion with her youthful fascination with beauty to her first forays in beauty salons to her acceptance by the major department stores. It seems that through the sheer force of her personality and handful of potions, Estee Lauder would convert even the most stubborn persons to ardent Estee Lauder devotees wether it was in rhe beauty salon, office or evalator.<br />A favorite story is Estee slipping off her heels after an extremely busy sales day at a department store and going over the accounts. Realizing she is two dollars short of her $1000 sales goal and with a few moments before the store officially closes, Estee slips back on her shoes and springs into action, selling enough product to bring her total day's sales to the desired $1000.<br />One shortcoming of the book is Estee Lauder's decision to not give dates of events unless absolutely necessary. We know when Youth Dew is introduced and the official founding of Estee Lauder but otherwise Estee remains mum. She does mention in the introduction to the book the debate over her age but does not settle the matter one way or another. One can understand her desire to be an ageless woman. The image of a cosmetics queen is one of eternal youth and beauty. Her fellow Cosmetic Queen Mary Kay Ash also did a little dance around her true age with her memoirs. <br />For the Estee Lauder devotee or even a student of fashion and cosmetics \\"Estee: A Success Story\\" is a must read.	2003-05-04

Her moment of white-hot fame is long faded and Clara Bow would not be a name remember by the average moviegoer. If she is remembered, it is for wild rumors about her instatible love life with anyone and anything to cross her path.<br />Thankfully David Stern has taken the time to carefully look at the true facts of Clara Bow, a film star so popular at one point that there would be a Clara Bow film for each season to meet the public's Bow fix.<br />Clara Bow could be consider the Uber-Star Rises From the Depths of Poverty to Incite the World. She was born in poverty, raised in a fractured home with a mother who turned tricks to make ends meet. Like so many other film stars, the young Clara was sexually abused. Her exceptional looks brought her to Hollywood.<br />Once in Hollywood, Clara defined sex for the nation, being crowned as having \\"IT\\" by no one less than Elinor Glyn (think a 1920s Jackie Collins or Judth Krantz). <br />After a series of scandals, Clara went from IT girl to reclusion, spending her remaining years with her film-star turned politican spouse. <br />For those willing to look beyond the scandal and rumors, \\"Clara Bow: Runnin' Wild\\" is a must read.	2003-05-04

For anyone who read Moveline magazine back in it's heyday, Eve Golden wrote witty video reviews along with other contributions.<br />Golden turns her attention to Jean Harlow and the result is stunning. The tragic, short life of the wisecracking blonde from the Mid-West is told without being too sugar-sweet and refrains from wallowing in gutter like a cetain 1960s biography of Harlow. Jean Harlow was a nice person with a longing to be more than just the blonde bombshell the public saw, not a nymphomaniac who needed a navy fleet and an ocean of booze to get through the night. <br />The layout of the book and the photographs are amazing. Reading this in hardcover is knowing you're reading some very special beyonf the usual as-told-to film/tv/ star tat that crowds the Biography sections.<br />For the film buff or newbie that wants a worthwhile read that's not hard on the eyes, \\"Platinum Girl\\" is a clear winner.	2003-05-04

The end result is a well-researched and well-written text that takes the reader from the shores of Europe to a small chain of islands where the dodo and it's genetic cousins made their homes.<br />Sadly, the dodo and it's genetic cousins were doomed to extinction with the arrival of Europeans (starting with the Portuguese). The plump, flightless animals were slow breeders with a single offspring per mating season and no natural enemies. Add ravenous creatures (Homo sapiens included) into their safe mircosphere and diaster was assured.<br />Pinto-Correia traces the few captive dodos in Euorpe and the fates of their remains. Now, the only things the modern world has of the dodo are a scattering of bones, some paintings and sketches and the cultural understanding that to be a dodo is to be doomed.<br />A must read for the natural history reader or devotee.	2003-05-04

But under that cloud of hair was a charming and witty person who if she was alive today, I would love to listen too. David Stern shows the young woman who was under her mother (Mama Jean)'s thumb but not completely down-trodden.

Two Hollywood murder cases wrecked havoc on the lives of those closest to the victims. One was William Desmond Taylor. The second was Paul Bern.<br />When Paul Bern was found dead one morning, suspicions flew and continued to haunt his young bride Jean Harlow until her own tragic end. Did Paul Bern kill himself? Did Jean Harlow do it? Did he really beat poor Jean to a pulp, pushing her to the edge? Or was another force at work?<br />Like William Desmond Taylor before him, Paul Bern had a secret life that Hollywood knew little about. A woman, Dorothy Millette had lived with Bern as man and wife before his Hollywood glory days. Could Dorothy have reappeared in Bern's life and pulled the trigger on her former lover/common law spouse before ending her own life mere days later?<br />The only people who will truly ever know what happened at those in the room the night of Bern's death. But Samuel Marx builds a strong case for Paul Bern being murdered and not at the hands of his young wife. If Dorothy Millette was the real murderer, the rumor mill of 1930s Hollywood and a certain Harlow biographer of the 1960s did Jean Harlow and Paul Bern a great injustice and insult.	2003-05-04

Not wanting to dull my brain with endless hours of television, I cracked open \\"Mapp & Lucia\\".<br />Ten pages into the book and I was hooked. Lucia, her period of mourning almost over is looking to regain her iron control on her hometown. First action, regain her star role as Queen Elizabeth in the village fete.<br />As I read Lucia's plots and plans, a strange thought hit me. Lucia is the creature Hyacinth Bucket (the main character of the BBC's Keeping Up Appearances) secretly dreams of being. Having taken over the fete from her dazed and confused friend, Lucia goes onto greater pastures, the hometown of Miss Elizabeth Mapp, reigning social goddesss.<br />Miss Elizabeth Mapp (known as Mapp) plots with her friends to rent out their respective homes a profit. Lucia and her best friend (a gentleman who brings to mind a cross between KUA's Richard and AYBS Mr Humphries) move and slowly begin to take over the town. Mapp is not pleased and a genteel war of one-upsmanship begins between the two ladies. <br />Drawings are rejected from the art exhibit, parties given, ownership of produce and fruit desputed with the poor town in the middle. Matters come to a head on Boxing Day (December 26) when Mapp decides to steal a longed for recipe that Lucia refuses to give to her. <br />Lucia stumbles on her rival in the kitchen and both women are swept out to sea on Lucia's kitchen table (yes, Lucia's kitchen table, this is a not a mis-type). The town mourns the two ladies as lost and the Great War of Mapp-Lucia as over.<br />Okay, enough said. You'll have to succumb to the collective charms of the ladies Mapp and Lucia yourself and find out all the bits I've left out. Now, I'm off hunt down and read the rest of E.F. Benson's wonderful books.	2003-05-04

Joshi, the collection includes a wonderful brief biographical sketch of Lovecraft that goes beyond the usual scant information usually seen about the author and marvelously detailed notes that not only discuss references in the story itself but give a short history of each story's publication and further reading suggestions. <BR> The number of stories included the Penguin editions may not be as vast as the recent Del Ray trade paperback editions. However the true Lovecraft devotee and those new to the Providence Gentleman will be thrilled with the vast amount of information contained between the covers.	2001-10-04

Confess...you've seen the cover and peeked at the inner flap...<br />The chronicle of a former stripper who decides to have one last fling with stripping before she weds. Not every part of the book is compelling or deep. Some parts have appeared elsewhere on-line. And the ending left me wanting more. <br />However there are gems among her adventures. The sequence involving classes at the stripper school is a complete hoot. And reading the chapter on the history of striptease after watching a program on Dixie Evans added to my reading experience. <br />This book WILL NOT tell you how to be a stripper or claim to be THE book on the striptease life. It is an interesting look at one person's adventures in the shadow world of striptease.	2001-10-02

Unlike most recent Lovecraft fiction offerings, &quot;The Shadow Out of Time&quot; focuses on Lovecraft's final tale concerning Nathaniel Wingate Peaslee, a professor at the infamous Miskatonic University who undergoes an amazing personality change that leads to a mysterious expedition under the deserts of Australia. Working from Lovecraft's own handwritten manuscript along with the common versions, the result is &quot;The Shadow Out of Time&quot; as Lovecraft himself must have visioned the final product. <BR> Along with the corrected text, there are the marvelous detailed notes, appendices and history that readers have come to realize as the hallmark of a Joshi/Schultz collaboration. And like other Joshi/Schultz edited volumes, &quot;The Shadow Out of Time&quot; is a must have item for the complete H.P. Lovecraft library. Hopefully many other volumes devoted to other Lovecraft classics will follow.	2001-10-01

Charming and highly informative book on HP Lovecraft/Lovecraft related movies including all the usual suspects (ie the Stuart Gordon/Jeffrey Coombs/Barbara Crampton titles) and short films that might escape the attention of the average filmgoer. Misters Strysik and Migliore prove their love of both cinema and all things Lovecraft. with this fast paced read chock-full of eye candy (three cheers to Armitage House &amp; Beyond Books for the wonderful layout)...<br />Besides the in-depth and witty reviews, there are interviews with the people behind the adaptations and an introduction from top Lovecraft scholar, S.T. Joshi. After finishing Lurker In The Lobby was ready to race off to the local video store (the only thing stopping me was the lateness of the hour) and rent enough films to keep me glued to the couch for hours.	2001-09-19

Finally, the long awaited annotated edition of HPL's essential essay of horror/weird fiction is here...<br />The only flaw/drawback to this edition is the decision to keep all annotation notes in the back of the book unlike previous annotated Lovecraft works. Granted, having the annotations at the bottom of the revelant page did slow down a straight reading of only the text in the annotated story collections. However, an indepth reading was not hampered by having to track down the exact footnote/annotation. <br />Even with this minor design point, your Lovecraft library deserves this new annotated edition of a Lovecraft classic...Once again, S.T. Joshi proves his status as THE Lovecraft scholar with his in-depth research that sheds new light on this classic work for the modern reader.	2001-09-05

An addiction to Ripperology and other infamous cases of true crime originally drew me to this book. A warning: THIS IS NOT AN ITEM FOR THE FAINT OF HEART. Even with the various Ripper related books I've read over the years, parts of the prose had me cringing in horror.<br />The most compelling prose in the various selections lies in the exploration of the six most common Ripper suspects (The Butcher, The Priest, The Poet, The Physician, The Psychic and The Prince). Even a casual reading can turn into a marathon reading session.<br />The language used is graphic and the images presented can be quite disturbing. Small details from the real Ripper case files such as the contents of victim Catherine Eddowes' pockets are woven in the narrative, adding that extra bit of realism to draw you into the insular world of Whitechapel during the murders.<br />Ripper! is not another volume in the endless flow of armchair detective volumes that litter the true crime section of your local bookseller. You will not come away with a definitive answer to who committed these crimes. Buchanan does not force his opinions or wild theories about the Ripper's true identity on the reader unlike most Ripperology selections. Instead the reader is offered a look into what visions may have filled the mind and compelled the person behind the Ripper murders.	2001-09-05

Have recently signed up for a networking course at the local community college and honestly had no clue about ANYTHING to do  with networks. Best used as a primer for what networks are. If you have a  good grasp of network basics already, then this book will not be the best  buy.	2000-06-08
