Former National Lampoon satirist Tony Hendra has crafted a compelling narrative of his remarkable faith journey in \\"Father Joe: The Man Who Saved My Soul\\".  <br /> <br />Picking up the book, the first thing I was struck by was the sheer beauty of the writing. It's like reading a work of art. <br /> <br />Hendra begins his story in suburban England as a clueless adolescent boy who somehow finds himself being wrapped up in an older woman's adulterous fantasies. When her (very Catholic) husband discovers their affair, he drives Tony to a Benedictine monastery for a weekend of intense spiritual direction. At first scared out of his wits, Hendra encounters a monk -- Fr. Joseph Warrilow -- whose gentleness and charity are disarming and magnetic.  <br /> <br />Tony finds within Fr. Joe a holiness and meaning to life that he'd never encountered before. This was a face of Christianity that, until then, that he hadn't experienced. He is fascinated with the Benedictine way of life: their brotherhood, their manual labor, their musical prayer. He left the monastery a truly different person -- his heart larger than ever, his life purposeful, and his soul soaring to the heavens. He knew it then: he wanted to be a monk. <br /> <br />(And I might add: reading Hendra's descriptions of his spiritual highs and lows is almost a spiritual experience in and of itself. He captures the essence of the joy of conversion and, later, the despair of doubt. There are a great many spiritual treasures in this book: don't miss out them!) <br /> <br />Tony spends the remaining years of high school as a sort of monk-in-waiting. Visiting the monastery as often as he can, speaking with Fr. Joe, finishing his schooling only as a concession to the temporal world.  <br /> <br />Then something unexpected happens. He is accepted to, and against his will, attends, Cambridge University. In the midst of his time at Cambridge, he became fascinated with the burgeoning field of satirical comedy. Slowly, he delvesdeeper and deeper into satire, and -- without realizing it at first -- becomes less and less interested in the spiritual life.  <br /> <br />Somehow, his loss of interest in the Benedictines eventually translates into a complete falling out from his Christian faith. He lives for satire, moving to the U.S. and writing for the National Lampoon, and trying to \\"save the world\\" from the designs of rightists like Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. He indulges in drugs, hatred, promiscuity, and all sorts of other base pleasures. Against his will, be becomes a (bad) husband and father -- twice. At one point he attempts suicide.  <br /> <br />Hendra's story will really take you to the extremes of life: from a childish cluelessness, to a joyful holiness, to a dark life of quiet desperation, to ... well, I've given away too much already. Suffice it to say that, from this low point in his life, he does seek out that man that stood in his memory as a lighthouse of hope, Fr. Joe. <br /> <br />It is a very emotionally and spiritually intense book: one that will bring tears to your eyes, a smile to your face, and, perhaps, a little peace to your soul. Ultimately it is a more than worthwhile read. (There are also, I might add as an aside, some very interesting reflections on the changes in the Church during the '60s from the perspective of a man who basically missed them at the time.) <br /> <br />My only complaint about the book is that sometimes Hendra lets his liberal political sympathies taint his spiritual reflections. Toward the end of the book, for example, in the middle of an emotional reflection on Fr. Joe, he sticks in an awkward jab about the Church's supposed bad treatment of homosexuals. <br /> <br />In any event, there are so many spiritual gems in this book, I wouldn't want to blow its few drawbacks out of proportion. These little revelations -- mostly in the form of spiritual direction from Fr. Joe -- will truly speak to readers about their own lives, faith, spirituality, and vocations. Yes, \\"Father Joe: The Man Who Saved My Soul\\" is essentially a vocation story: how a funny-looking, humble, culturally irrelevant monk helped a headstrong, naive, curious boy become the man that God wanted him to be.	2005-08-28

Liberal reviewers denounce the book, and some conservative reviewers are gloating about it. Did we read the same book?  <br /> <br />Byron York's \\"The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy\\" is a detailed political analysis of the Left's unprecedented organization in the 2004 election. The most committed elements of the American Left came together like never before to defeat George W. Bush. Independent activists like George Soros, Michael Moore, MoveOn.org, America Coming Together, Air America, and the Center for American Progress emerged and circumvented the traditional party structure in order to ensure Bush's defeat. <br /> <br />In spite of the money and effort poured into the cause, Bush, of course, won the race by 3 percent. York's diagnosis is that the new players -- MoveOn, ACT, etc. -- essentially were preaching to the choir, while the whole time thinking they were forging a broad, national, anti-Bush consensus.  <br /> <br />Drawing from interviews with key operatives, York documents the inside story of the 527s and other new groups that emerged in 2004. He demonstrates how MoveOn.org grew from an idea into a powerhouse of the Left; how America Coming Together grew out of MoveOn; how George Soros became interested, got involved, and legitimated MoveOn and ACT; and how these fringe groups found themselves at the center of the Democrats' run for the presidency. He also documents how these groups stretched the campaign finance law that they had so vigorously supported. <br /> <br />But the scary part is this: York, a columnist for National Review, notes that in the wake of conservative icon Barry Goldwater's landslide defeat to Lyndon Johnson, conservatives took decades to build the institutions of the conservative movement that we know and love today (a network of think tanks, grassroots issue-based groups, talk radio shows, etc.). Now, the 2004 election could be for liberals what that 1964 election was for conservatives: a turning point. But conservatives took decades to overcome the Democratic majority (at least in Congress). Conservatives today don't have that big a majority and the Dems are nevertheless organizing to re-establish a sizeable political majority of their own. Just today (8/7/05), there was a Washington Post story about rich liberals pouring money into creating new \\"progressive\\" think tanks.  <br /> <br />\\"The Vast Left Wing Conspiracy\\" is a warning for conservatives, one which they would be wise to take seriously.	2005-08-09

There are a million different ways to assess people's personalities. \\"Personality Plus\\", however, sticks out from this sorry group like a sore thumb (I mean that in a good way). The author, Florence Littauer re-packages the ancient Greeks' thinking about personality into a Christian perspective on personalities, personal improvement, and social relationships.<br /><br />The Greeks thought there were essentially only four types of personalities: sanguine (talkative, life-of-the-party), melancholy (introverted, artsy, deep, perfectionist), choleric (workaholic, ambitious, leader), and phlegmatic (go-with-the-flow, nonchalant).<br /><br />Frankly, I've found the wisdom of the ancient Greeks to be far superior to modern methods that seek to categorize every little aspect of your life. Mrs. Littauer, weaving in personal experiences, anecdotes, and her knowledge of the four personalities, has written a wonderful little book on \\"how to understand others by understanding yourself\\". You'll be an expert in no time.<br /><br />She discusses the personalities themselves, their strengths and weaknesses, methods of improving on your strengths and overcoming your weaknesses, relationships among people of various personalities, blended personalities, and more. (Of course, she includes a self-test that you can take to determine your personality.)<br /><br />It is no exaggeration to say that learning about these social dynamics and personal realities can improve your friendships and even save your marriage! This is because you will learn to recognize, accept, and deal with other personalities in a systematic way that you otherwise wouldn't have been taught.<br /><br />I docked the book one star because Mrs. Littauer tends to charicature certain personalities. She will dwell so much on your weaknesses that you'll think to yourself, \\"I'm not THAT bad!\\" Then again, at least she gets her point across.<br /><br />Mrs. Littauer includes a short Bible quote at the end of each chapter, and dedicates a short chapter to the importance of loving Christ, who completes us as persons and who wants to use our unique talents in His Divine Providence. But it is not a book of theology or Scriptural hermeneutics; \\"Personality Plus\\" is constructed in such a way as to be accessible to believers and nonbelievers alike.<br /><br />Indeed, everybody should know about the four personality types. Don't delay!	2005-08-03

Frankly, the situation is starker than you think. In \\"An End to Evil\\", David Frum and Richard Perle detail a comprehensive, realistic strategy that could be (indeed, should have been) employed against the terrorists that continue to threaten Western society. <br /> <br />(Full disclosure: I listened to the abridged audio CD.) <br /> <br />From governmental reform, to homeland security, to international diplomacy and military force, Frum and Perle offer specific -- and utterly sensible -- recommendations on how to triumph in this new global struggle. The authors have an insiders' perspective, having both served in the Bush 43 administration. They give broad perspective (sorely lacking from news accounts these days) on the strategic challenges posed by, and political realities within, Europe, China, North Korea, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria, the United Nations, and more. They tell you what really happens in the bureaucracies at the CIA, State Dept, Defense Dept, and FBI, and what needs to change.  <br /> <br />I was nearly deterred from buying this book because of a melodramatic review that characterized the authors as wanting to start World War III, and recklessly invade various countries. The book's hyperbolic and uncreative title seemed to give credence to this idea. But I am thankful that I ultimately did buy the book, because that's not at all what \\"An End to Evil\\" is. It's a sobering, factual look at the current realities of national and international security.  <br /> <br />As it happens, most of the authors' advice is designed to achieve swift, peaceful, and advantageous resolutions of conflicts and potential conflicts in various global hotspots, but first and foremost--and here they differ from the politically correct forces of appeasement--their overriding goal is to keep Americans, and innocent civilians worldwide, safe from Islamic terrorism. Therefore, they do not flinch from diplomatic or military confrontation if that is what is needed. Their outlook is truly global, and very comprehensive, addressing both Islamofascism and its roots, both domestic and foreign policy, etc. <br /> <br />The authors pull no punches, and they take this War on Terror seriously, as should all Americans. Potential readers would be wise to ignore the typical hysterics of those reviewers who simply don't take this war seriously. For those Americans who do, \\"An End to Evil\\" is well worth reading.	2005-08-03

What does Christ really expect of us when He instructs those who would be His disciples to give up their worldly possessions (e.g., Mt 19:21-24)? If you're like me, you've always gotten a little nervous around passages like these and maybe you try not to think about them. <br /> <br />But everyone concerned about living an authentically Christian life should read Fr. Dubay's \\"Happy Are You Poor\\". It's a personally challenging exploration of the meaning of the virtue of poverty (\\"Blessed are the poor\\"). That is to say, it will challenge you to deepen your commitment to Christ and His Kingdom.  <br /> <br />Fr. Dubay tells us flat out that he thinks we ought to hear the true message of Gospel poverty that too many are afraid to proclaim (or practice): Christians must lead radically simple, frugal, and charitable lives. Demonstrated through Scripture and most prominantly through the lives of the saints, Fr. Dubay's book is a formidable challenge to our current lifestyles.  <br /> <br />The first four chapters of \\"Happy Are You Poor\\", which comprises \\"part one\\", are almost entirely preliminary (and mostly boring). In them, Fr. Dubay (rightly) pleads with readers to approach his book prayerfully and with an openness to correction and admonishment. He spends a long time lamenting the fact that the virtue of poverty has been watered down by many good natured folks trying to make sense of their religious vows. They reduce saintly poverty (to which we are all called) to a vague sense of \\"detachment\\" from material goods or to an \\"availability to others\\" with one's time and self. The book is largely geared toward that audience -- those who have previously misinterpreted Gospel poverty.  <br /> <br />But then he goes on to describe Gospel poverty, and its concrete demands based upon each state of life (married, single, celibate, vowed, etc.). This part is invaluable, no matter who you are. Before you know it, you'll be seriously considering lifestyle changes (for the greater glory of God!) that you wouldn't have before. Fr. Dubay even includes an examen in the back of the book for personal reflection and growth.  <br /> <br />This is a topic that needs to be discussed more. If anything, the possibility that this is God's will for you should be reason enough to buy this book. Indeed, He calls all of us to the virtue of poverty. How are you living it?	2005-06-30

What I got instead was a liberal author hitting me over the head with his political correctness and his opinions about the Church.<br /><br />MOST OF THE PEOPLE PROFILED IN THIS BOOK ARE NOT CANONIZED SAINTS, so if saints are what you're looking for, then you should [[ASIN:0060692995 look]] [[ASIN:0385491824 elsewhere]]. \\"All Saints\\" instead includes a rather silly assortment of Catholics, anti-Catholics, heretics, Protestants, and non-Christians who the author personally considers holy -- e.g., Galileo, Gandhi, Thoreau, Wesley, Hus, Camus. I honestly hope these people are in Heaven, but Ellsberg defeats the very purpose of a devotional book about saints. Surely there are many people in Heaven who have not been canonized, but canonizing saints allows us to (1) imitate true examples of heroic virtue and successful Christian life, and (2) pray to people who we know are in Heaven and whose intercession with God is therefore powerful! Including so many uncanonized people in this book really undermines its devotional purpose.<br /><br />Sadly, you can't get past the introduction without encountering the author's ideological agenda. He laments the absence of gender-inclusive language in the writings of saints, and insists that we need more saints who pursued social \\"justice\\", not necessarily personal \\"charity\\". He says that our current canon of saints recognizes mostly only \\"conventional forms of piety\\". (Read any writing of any saint. The saints were anything but conventional! That's why they're saints: see Matt. 7:14.) Ellsberg also reveals that he hopes \\"to expand the popular understanding of holiness itself\\". Please. If there's any value to a book about saints, presumably it's because THEY can teach US about true sanctity -- so close are they to God. Yet Ellsberg unabashedly sets HIMSELF as the authority and arbiter of sanctity.<br /><br />Anyway, you get the point. You buy a devotional book like this because you want to be challenged and uplifted by the wisdom of the saints.

As a Catholic, I was hesitant to read a book that I feared would take Koranic passages out of context and then present them as proof of Islam's falsity (precisely because this is what many people do to Christianity). A friend lent me this book, however, and assured me that it wasn't agenda-driven or unreasonable. I noticed that the co-author, Daniel Ali, is a former Muslim, so I decided to give it a shot and I'm so glad that I did. (I learned more about Islam from this book than I did from my religious studies class!)<br />Given Islam's rising popularity and rapid expansion into Western society, we cannot afford to ignore Islam's claim to be God's final revelation. Despite our best intentions of tolerance among all religions, we cannot be closed-minded to the possibility that a religion might proclaim untruth -- or even injustice. \\"Inside Islam,\\" which contrasts Islam's claims with those of Christianity, is a must-read for all Christians, and Catholics in particular.<br />Utilizing a highly readable question-and-answer format, the authors draw from a huge base of knowledge of Islamic theology, scholarship and tradition to demonstrate that Islam cannot be what it claims to be. Extensive endnotes provide the reader with the opportunity to cross-examine sources.<br />You will read how Mohammad's exposure to Christian heresies distorted his view of Christianity and how these misinterpretations have been incorporated into the Koran -- and how they still inform Muslim views of Christians as idolators to this day. (Mohammad, for example, apparently thought that the Trinity was a union of God, Mary, and Jesus -- and that God had sexual relations with Mary in order to conceive a son. Mohammad understandably saw this crude idea as unworthy of a perfect God.)<br />You will read how fundamentalist Muslims can appeal to the Koran and the Hadith to support their ideas about the inferiority of women, theinferiority of Christians and Jews (who are called \\"apes and swine\\" in the Koran), and the imperative to fight unbelievers.<br />You will learn how the conceptions of God, humanity, salvation, and the afterlife radically differ in Islam and Christianity. (I thought these theological contrasts were alone worth the entire price of the book!) You will read about the Koran's curious \\"abrogation theory\\" which attempts to reconcile contradictions in the Koran by insisting that Allah can change his mind about morality and truth.<br />\\"Inside Islam\\" is a profoundly important book. I would recommend it to Catholics, Christians, and even Muslims. To avoid it, assuming that Islam is a \\"religion of peace\\" since it is a religion at all, would be myopic. This book's only agenda is the pursuit of truth. Give it a shot -- you'll be surprised by what you find.	2004-05-30

Theologian George Weigel's new &quot;Letters to a Young Catholic&quot; is a remarkable peek into the Beauty of Catholicism. It should be required reading for all Catholics, Protestants -- and even non-Christians!<br />There is perhaps nobody more suited to write a book like this than George Weigel. Mr. Weigel is the author of more than ten books, including &quot;The Truth of Catholicism,&quot; &quot;The Courage to Be Catholic,&quot; and, of course, the much-celebrated biography of Pope John Paul II, &quot;Witness to Hope.&quot;<br />&quot;Letters to a Young Catholic&quot; is very much a roadmap of modern Catholicism. Mr. Weigel takes readers on a literary tour of the Catholic world. We visit the most likely and unlikely of places -- from GK Chesterton's favorite pub to the Vatican's Sistine Chapel -- as Mr. Weigel demonstrates that the world and the Church are &quot;the arena of God's action.&quot;<br />He expounds on Catholicism's belief that God's presence can be experienced through art, history, literature, and even other people! As Weigel says, &quot;we can touch the truth of our salvation&quot; -- this life matters!! You'll never think of the Holy Catholic Church in the same way again!<br />I have never been so struck by the sheer beauty of truth as I was when I read &quot;Letters.&quot; In every destination Weigel takes us, he finds opportunities to expound on the Catholic understanding of the world -- and of reality. <br />Weigel's writing is clear, concise, and convincing. I'd recommend the book to anyone and everyone. Catholics will rediscover the majesty of their Faith, and non-Catholics will be touched -- and challenged -- by the Beauty of Truth.	2004-05-16

I am a social conservative and previously supported the War on Drugs because, well, drugs are bad.<br />But I read this book and became convinced that the U.S. couldn't have devised a better strategy than the War on Drugs to ENRICH drug dealers and INCREASE harms affiliated with drug abuse. If Americans had ANY IDEA how reckless and counterproductive our current drug policy is, there would be HUGE political pressure for change. <br />That's where &quot;Why Our Drug Laws Have Failed&quot; comes in. Conservative judge James P. Gray -- who presides over the Superior Court in Orange County, CA -- is certainly &quot;in the know&quot; about drug abuse issues. With over 20 years' experience as a judge, Gray is on the front lines of the War on Drugs. A former prosecutor and self-proclaimed &quot;drug warrior,&quot; Gray's own efforts only persuaded him that the War on Drugs is causing much more harm than good. <br />(I took off one star because Gray is a decent writer, but much of his sentence construction is a little clunky.)<br />This book should be required reading for EVERY American voter! Judge Gray will convince you that America is only shooting itself in the foot and dragging down other countries with it. (Indeed, Gray promises in his introduction: &quot;No one who reads this book and thinks objectively about the issues it raises will favor a continuation of our present drug policy.&quot;) This is not just rhetoric -- even with all the sweat, blood, and money we pump into the drug war, there are more drugs on our streets than ever before! We couldn't have devised a bigger failure if we tried.<br />Thankfully, the author does detail numerous common-sense alternatives to the two extremes of drug prohibition and drug legalization. <br />&quot;Why Our Drug Laws Have Failed&quot; demonstrates that our War on Drugs is needlessly and recklessly tearing apart lives and families. That should be enough to give liberals AND conservatives pause.	2004-05-05

Kreeft, a Catholic professor of philosophy at Boston College, has a brilliant command of logic. And he makes it accessible to the average reader. <br />&quot;Three Approaches to Abortion&quot; is divided into three parts. The first is Kreeft's main argument, his &quot;Apple Argument Against Abortion&quot; which argues in 15 steps from the premise that &quot;we know what an apple is&quot; to the conclusion that &quot;abortion must be outlawed.&quot; The second section is an essay by Kreeft describing 15 motivations behind the pro-life movement. The third section is a delightful (imaginary) dialogue between a pro-lifer and a pro-choicer. In it, Kreeft refutes the 15 most common pro-choice arguments. <br />There is no doubt that &quot;Three Approaches to Abortion&quot; is a great read and a welcome contribution to the pro-life cause. Kreeft portrays the book as &quot;thoughtful and compassionate&quot; and says right in the preface that the book is meant to be read by pro-choicers. <br />I found in this book an abundance of thoughtfulness but, unfortunately, a lack of compassion. He makes great points throughout the book -- inspiring many &quot;Eureka!&quot; moments in me -- but I think he lets his moral disgust with abortion get the best of him.<br />Particularly in section 2 (which he admittedly calls a &quot;pro-life motivational map&quot;) as well as in a brief &quot;historical postscript&quot; to section 1, Kreeft's logical arguments give way to polemical attacks against the &quot;culture of death.&quot; Which I totally agree with! My only problem is that they'd probably serve to offend any pro-choicers and confuse any atheists who may read the book.<br />It's unfortunate, because Kreeft is a great, great writer and philosopher. If you're pro-life, don't miss &quot;Three Approaches to Abortion&quot;! If you're pro-choice, buy the book and skip section 2.	2004-05-02

Lipsky had unprecedented access. He effectively portrays the (harsh/unfortunate/disappointing) realities of life at West Point, but that's ultimately all he does. He begins and ends the book proclaiming his admiration for all those he met, but he never explains why. <br />Although he tries to expound on the merits of service, the portraits of cadets and servicemembers he presents are almost always negative. One cadet is a total failure, socially, militarily, and academically; one expects a story of triumph over the odds -- but he ends up graduating West Point just barely, and without any friends. Another cadet has just about the worst luck ever: his friend dies, he has trouble with his girlfriend, etc. One expects him to find meaning in his life through service in the armed forces, but the book ends with him resigned to duty he doesn't really want. <br />On the whole, there are some insights thoughout the book, but I was ultimately disappointed and left asking myself why Lipsky wrote the book in the first place if he was only going to offer such a bleak picture of life as this?

I just finished reading Peter Kreeft's &quot;A Refutation of Moral Relativism.&quot; I couldn't imagine a more thought-provoking, eye-opening, and genuinely meaningful book.<br />Kreeft, a professor of philosophy at Boston College, examines the definition, history, and importance of moral relativism. He makes an impeccable case that the current controversy over the nature of morality -- that is, whether it be relative or absolute -- is THE most crucial debate of our time. <br />The book opened my eyes to a whole new way of thinking about Western culture. We are so conditioned to believe that morality is relative that such conditioning affects our thinking, our language and diction, our schooling, our media, and (obviously) our morality -- our very way of life (and thus, maybe, our afterlife?). Kreeft makes the case that, with so much at stake, we cannot afford to be wrong.<br />A master logician and philosopher, Kreeft takes on the arguments for moral relativism one by one. His refutation is devastating; he demonstrates that most arguments for relativism are logically self-contradictory and, indeed, that morality cannot be anything other than absolute either in theory or in practice. (He even shows that tolerance--often an explicit reason for belief in relativism--is a virtue only achieved through moral absolutism.) <br />Afterwards, Kreeft turns his exacting lens on absolutism, its assumptions and its role in reality. He is, if nothing else, supremely objective and fair-minded.<br />But don't let the thought of reading about logic and philosophy turn you off! Professor Kreeft as much for the average reader as he does for anyone else. His writing is accesible, reasonable (in the most literal sense of that word), and, above all, ENJOYABLE. As his subtitle indicates, the book is in the form of several interviews, or debates, between a moral absolutist, 'Isa, and a moral relativist, Libby.<br />&quot;A Refutation of Moral Relativism&quot; should be required reading in all philosophy courses dealing with morality. It is perhaps one of the most underappreciated books ever published. Professor Kreeft's message is so profoundly deep and meaningful that it can change the course of Western culture. Don't go another day without reading this book!	2003-11-08

What I found was not the polemical denunciation of anti-Catholic prejudice that I had craved (in order to feel vindicated) but rather a careful, erudite--at times sociological--study of anti-Catholicism which I ultimately found no less fascinating!<br />Chapters 2 and 3 (there are ten total) concern the history of American anti-Catholic bigotry. Consisting of largely classic nativist paranoia about anti-Catholicism, the history itself I found to be rather dry. But I stuck with it, and I'm glad I did. Understanding the history of the prejudice, Jenkins demonstrates, is necessary to understand anti-Catholicism as a whole. Indeed, many of the vicious ultraliberal attacks on the Church that we encounter today are strikingly similar to the ultraconservative bigotry of a century ago. The book picks up pace after Chapter 3, however, as Jenkins explores topics like gay and feminist anti-Catholicism, Catholicism and the news media, Catholics in art, Catholics in Movies & TV, the recent sex abuse scandal, and what he calls \\"Black Legends,\\" distortions of Church history. The chapter on clerical sexual abuse is so engrossing that it is almost worth the price of the book by itself!<br />Throughout the book, Jenkins explores the definitional aspects of anti-Catholicism in addition to the topical aspects that I listed in the previous paragraph. He explains the difference (however slight) between anti-Catholicism and anti-clericalism. He notes that to spitefully disparage \\"the institution\\" of the Catholic Church, as opposed to \\"the members,\\" is to practice de facto anti-Catholicism since, unlike other religions, the institution is so deeply central to the Roman Catholic faith itself. He also explains that \\"it is not anti-Catholic simply to assert that the Church's position on a given issue is dead wrong, nor that Bishop X or Cadinal Y is a monster or menace to the public good. ... It is quite a different matter [however] to say that some essential features of [Catholicism] give rise to evil or abuse and that the evil cannot be prevented without fundamentally changing the beliefs or practices of the religion.\\" The author is a realist, not a sensationalist or somebody looking for controversy. Readers will be impressed with Jenkins.<br />It is important to note that Philip Jenkins himself, a distinguished professor of History and Religious Studies at Pennsylvania State University, is an Episcopalian. Indeed, he has no vested interest in defending Catholicism and doesn't hesitate to criticize the Church when the situation merits. But he calls on America to recognize that harmful anti-Catholic intolerance pervades popular culture in such a manner that would be unimaginable concerning Muslims, Jews, homosexuals, or blacks.	2003-05-04

Since there are no editorial reviews posted on Amazon, I assumed that this book was a collection of articles by contemporaries DEBATING history. In any case, although this book wasn't what I was looking for, it seems very substantive as far as primary sources go. It also seems like it is directed more at history teachers looking for teaching materials. <br />Contains articles (written by historical figures from John Winthrop to Thomas Jefferson to Frederick Douglass) about the original English colonization, the question of Native Americans, Puritans and religious tolerance, the Revolutionary War, the formation of the Constitution, the National Bank, Sedition Act, Jay Treaty, Louisiana Purchase, Federalism, immigration, expanding suffrage, annexation of Texas and war with Mexico, slavery, secession, and Reconstruction.	2003-04-16

Whether you are a committed Catholic or an ex-Catholic, you will benefit from this book.<br />The one aspect of &quot;The Truth of Catholicism&quot; that stands out in my mind is its philosophical/theological approach to issues. This isn't a conventional book in the sense that one can &quot;open&quot; to &quot;the&quot; chapter on, say, contraception and find answers. Mr. Weigel's book is brilliantly cumulative; that is, understanding of succeeding topics depends on understanding of certain Catholic principles and concepts that he spells out before discussing the actual &quot;controversies.&quot; &quot;The Truth of Catholicism,&quot; for me, was eye opening because it explained these bedrock principles that, as a Catholic, even I had not understood or been aware of. It really gave me an appreciation for the sheer depth of Catholic philosophy and thinking.<br />My only complaint is that the book was just too short! Regrettably, the author leaves some to be desired on the issues of divorce and ordination of women. As I was reading I wanted to dialogue with Mr. Weigel, ask him questions about this or that conclusion. But I do recommend the book wholeheartedly!	2003-01-24

It is very readable and actually spurred my further interest in the topics of Church structure, procedure, and politics.     It is, however, left-leaning. Not in the sense that Mr. Allen shoves his viewpoints down the readers' throats, but rather in the sense of saying things and bringing up issues that an orthodox Catholic would not. He gives the false impression that the Pope has authority to change church teachings on women's ordination, contraception, homosexuality, and the usual liberal priorities. And he refers to heterodox theologians as \\"reform-minded\\", and frowns upon Rome's insistence on orthodoxy.    Anyway, \\"Conclave\\" begins with a job description of the papacy and then details the main issues about which electors will be concerned. (I found this background information especially helpful.) Mr. Allen then explains exactly what will happen in Vatican City from the moment the Pope passes away, walking readers through the announcement of the Pope's death, the funeral arrangements, the assembly of the cardinals in Rome, the actual voting process, and into the first few days of the new papacy. Contained in the final chapters are explanations of the various voting blocs--for lack of a better term--within the College of Cardinals and biographies of possible candidates.    John Allen's \\"Conclave\\" is a concise, erudite, and, above all, fascinating account of the history, politics, and process of papal elections. Lay Catholics will benefit from this book; for me, it served as a solid introduction to the Vatican as an institution and to the issues that face the Church today.	2003-01-16

I usually don't write reviews of books that already have scores of them already written. After all, what could I possibly have to contribute that somebody else hasn't already said?<br />But I finished this book literally minutes ago and I consider it one of the best books I've ever read. An Indian immigrant, Mr. D'Souza brings a unique perspective to the topic of American culture and politics. He lays out a realistic and intellectually impressive argument that &quot;there is something great and noble about America.&quot; He revisits the history of Western civilization and offers an interpretation that is foreign to any contemporary student of American and European history: that--above all else--the West, with America embodying its ideals, has had an undeniably positive impact on people's lives throughout the world. <br />D'Souza takes on tough issues, like the impacts of slavery, racism, colonialism, and the cultural permissiveness that the non-Western world hates, with skill as a writer and erudition as a philosopher, historian, and political analyst. &quot;What's So Great About America&quot; is my first D'Souza book, but it certainly will not be my last. Mr. D'Souza's writing is personal and smooth; he seamlessly weaves anecdotes with facts, history with philosophy, and humor with logic. I couldn't get enough of this book.<br />One last note that is important to make is that Mr. D'Souza is as far from partisan (or even ideological) as one possibly can be. He takes on everyone from Noam Chomsky to Robert Bork. Don't dismiss the book upon seeing its title. It is not the &quot;feel-good&quot; book that the cover makes it out to be; it is profoundly intellectual, even eye-opening. It will, if nothing else, broaden your worldview.	2003-01-12

Weighing in at only 83 pages, this book leaves much to be desired. Most &quot;chapters&quot; consist of only a review of an issue's history followed by a series of questions about it, in a food-for-thought manner. <br />To be fair, the book seems like it is intended for religious education classes or other discussion groups. For the individual reader, however, I would look into George Weigel's book, &quot;The Truth of Catholicism,&quot; Peter Kreeft's &quot;Catholic Christianity,&quot; or Alan Schreck's &quot;Catholic and Christian.&quot;<br />I give the Most Reverend Pilarczyk credit for doing what many Archbishops should be doing--which is seeking to better educate the laity about Church teachings--but this book, unfortunately, just isn't substantive.	2003-01-04

So you may take this review with a grain of salt, since I'm reviewing this book in the midst of my European History course.<br />So far, the book has been great. The Princeton Review's AP United States History review helped me so much that I decided to stay with that company for my Euro class, and I haven't been disappointed. The book does a great job with reviewing major periods of time and has helped me study for tests. One particularly hard era to learn about is the &quot;Rise of Monarchical States&quot; (1500-1700) when we had to memorize the accomplishments of various monarchs (most with similar names!) from various countries. &quot;Cracking the AP European History Exam&quot; read like a story and really helped me remember each figure.<br />I recommend the Princeton Review's &quot;Cracking the AP European History Exam.&quot;<br />(Note: The book's cover says the author is Kim Magloire, when in fact it is Kenneth Pearl.)	2002-11-22

If you love English literature or are writing a research paper on Ishiguro, this book is great. But casual readers should first try &quot;The Remains of the Day,&quot; also by Ishiguro.	2002-11-22

So take this review with a grain of salt, because I'm in the midst of my Bio course. <br />THE GOOD: I'm someone who has always had some trouble with science. This book actually has helped me a lot in terms of studying for tests and being able to conceptualize certain biological processes. The diagrams are clear and the quizzes after each chapter are helpful.<br />THE BAD: As noted in a previous review, there definitely are typos and errors in the book. Just in Chapter 6 (Molecular Genetics), for example, the book erroneously states that guanine is a pyrimidine while cytosine and thymine are purines (p. 74) and confuses the terms \\"transcription\\" and \\"translation\\" (top of p. 79). <br />OVERALL: I will continue to use this book and would recommend it to others. But DO NOT think you can use it as a teacher; it should be used only as a supplement to class notes and/or a textbook. Many times, however, I could not understand what the textbook was trying to say and \\"Cracking the AP Biology Exam\\" really helped me out. In my humble opinion, the good outweighs the bad.	2002-11-22

A Pale View of Hills is somewhat slow moving, but there's more than meets the eye. Lovers of literary analysis and interpretation will love all of Ishiguro's writing, including this novel. Hidden meaning is everywhere.<br />A Pale View of Hills is about a Japanese woman, Etsuko, now living in England dwelling on the recent suicide of her daughter. As she recounts her life, a reader may note striking parallels with her memories and her present suffering; is it possible reality and imagination have faded? An interesting aspect of the novel is its theme of intergenerational conflict. Set partly in post-WW2 Japan, conflict develops between the old generation, whose regressive ideals are now socially unacceptable, and the new generation, who look toward a future of Americanization.<br />(For all you English buffs out there, Ishiguro is not a bad choice for a research paper, provided you have access to critical analysis. My local library was able to get books on Ishiguro's writing--which are rare--from university libraries in the state. The internet was also useful.)<br />For the casual reader, while A Pale View isn't a bad book by any means (it is very readable), perhaps Remains of the Day would be more engaging.	2002-10-06

I promptly returned the book. <br />She basically repeats the same things over and over: that young people pay more into the system and get very little out of it. The disproportionate amount of money going towards seniors is an interesting issue, but I've basically summed it up for you here; there's no need to buy the book.<br />I might even had agreed with her had she not gone on and on about it.

Strobel, a former atheist and journalist, asks the tough questions of Christianity's defenders and scholars, and the answers he receives are compelling. <br />The message is that doubt shouldn't discourage you; doubting is healthy and will lead to stronger faith. Reason and faith aren't incompatible at all; they're complementary, and \\"The Case for Faith\\" demonstrates that beautifully. <br />This is a profoundly meaningful book; a must-read for theists and atheists alike! <br />One note: if you've already read several books on the existence of God, then you're probably familiar with most of the material in this book.
