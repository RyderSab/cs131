She touches upon many issues that are facing Japanese society - social pressures, immigration issues, prostitution, credit card abuse, marital relationships, work ethic - just to mention a few. These topics are all wound around a killing of a man and a whodunnit scenario. It's a good murder mystery, but it's even better if you are interested in learning about the Japan away from cliches like manga, anime, hi-tech, rich economy etc.<br /><br />Her recent novel, \\"Grotesque\\", has not yet been translated into English.<br /><br />If you like Japanese writers, I would also highly recommend Miyabe Miyuki, who has written over 40 books in Japanese, with just a few having been translated into Japanese. \\"All She Was Worth\\" is a great moden Japanese suspense novel.	2005-09-07

I now have a daughter and have been knitting a variety of things for her.  Although the sweaters in the book are adorable, I have several criticisms about this book:<br /><br />(1) it is NOT a book for beginners, as many of the patterns use fairly difficult techniques, which I was surprised at, with no real explanation about them (I had to look some of them up in my Vogue Knitting reference book); (2) there are no pictures of what the garment looks like - the photos are all nice and adorable, but if you can't see the finished shape the directions can be confusing - I had to re-knit parts of the sweater featured on the cover because I couldn't see how it all fit together.  The patterns are cute and adorable once finished, but they do take some time and patience to complete.	2004-08-30

I see that several reviewers have pointed to glaring mistakes in the computer front of this book, let me say that ALL the Japanese items in the book are COMPLETELY inaccurate and nonsensical! Prime example, in one scene he has the CEO of a Japanese company praying to the &quot;shichigosan&quot;, explaining that it is the 7 gods of good fortune. Well, I laughed out loud when I read that, because &quot;shichigosan&quot; is the Japanese kids festival that is celebrated when kids are 7,5 and 3 (i.e. 7 in Japanese is shichi, 5=go, you get the point). What he meant was &quot;shichifukujin&quot; the 7 gods of good fortune. A tiny bit of research could have easily avoided those horrible pitfalls. Other than these faux pas, the story is staid, characters boring, ending predictable. I had actually read the Davinci Code first, which I enjoyed (but not as much as all the reviewers hyped it up to be) but was completely disappointed with this book. I his publisher reads these reviews and edits the book properly!	2004-04-13

I was extremely disappointed with the second Baby Wise book. I loved the first one and pretty much followed it for my now 5 month old daughter and she did sleep through the night just at 7 weeks! Which was amazing. Coming off that high, I was eager to read the second book to see what insights the authors had to offer. My opinion is that the first book was so good and popular, they wrote a second book without much original thought. The authors re-hash the first book and some of the &quot;ethics&quot; lessons (this book focuses on behavior and ethics) they give are a bit, shall we say draconian. Don't waste your money, flip through it in the bookstore and buy yourself a nice thriller or murder mystery instead!	2004-04-13

At first I was skeptical, because I am not a big fan of Ken Follett, but when I read the new introduction by Follett in the book I was intrigued. In it he talks about how writers should stick with the type of book/story that got them a bestseller and it's a folly to deviate. But he did. He also says that the critics overlooked this book, yet it has beeen a strong seller, which has been mainly due to word of mouth (I hadn't heard about the book), which is the best kind of advertising. I couldn't agree more and it is an amazing book. The fictional story follows the building of a cathedral in 12th century England. Not only is the architectural history wonderful, but so are the various characters Follett populates the book with. The story is immensely capitvating, with good vs. evil (it is a cathedral after all) battling it out all the way. I'm not a big fan of historical fiction, especially the Medieval kind, but I found this book a great page turner and am glad Follett meandered down this path away from his usual genre. Good for him!	2004-04-13

I am an avid reader of all kinds of murder myesteries, but being part Asian, it is always fun to read a book where the main character is Asian.  In fact, in all the mainstream murder mysteries, this is the only leading Asian heroine.  April Woo is an American-Chinese raised in New York and is now Lieutenant in the homicide squad.  Not only is the story gripping, but the characters are wonderful and so are the side plots - April's overpowering know-it-all Chinese mother (very credibly depicted by Glass), April's on going love affair with hispanic partner, side plot of psychiatrist that helps her on her cases and so on.  So far, all of Glass' novels have been a gripping great read.  I can't wait for the next one!	2003-07-21

Although the main character, a famous Japanese cellist, surprised me.  She's not a stereotypical Japanese woman and Banks has done some good research to make her a real character.  I was definitely impressed by that (hence 3 stars).  But the story itself really didn't do much for me.  In the end, the demure Japanese cellist became a satire for the typical &quot;anime&quot; woman fighter, which was a bit disappointing. But like all of Banks' novels, it is well written and very readable.	2003-07-21

However, no book has moved me as much as this one.  Written by a German, this book takes a completely different approach to the topic of the holocaust and the rise of the Nazis, a human approach. It allows the reader to read about this time without feeling intimated or uncomfortable.  Schlink broaches the subject in a very unique way, very indirectly, but lets the reader understand the horrors of that period in German history - I was very moved.  The story itself is very clever and well written.  It's hard to say that one enjoyed reading about such a topic, but it was for me a very refreshing and refined way to look at how this period in German history affected Germans.  Not in an in your face way.  This is a fine piece of literature.	2003-07-19

I am not a huge Africa fan and was a little apprehensive about reading this book.  However, it came highly recommended from a good friend and I have always been interested in reading a novel by Paul Theroux.  I was very pleasantly surprised by the book.  Theroux writes very unassumingly and is easy to read.  He is definitely well-versed and well-researched in what he writes about.  Including a wide range of additional information, simply added as tid-bits or anecdotes - without sounding condescending or like a know-it-all.  That I found very impressive.  Obviously his knowledge of Africa is vast, having spent a lot of time there in the past.  I very much enjoyed this book, although it is quite daunting at first, since it is so long, but in the end it is a journey through Africa, so taking that into consideration, it's not that long.  For anyone that wants to get a glimpse of Africa and knows very little of Africa, this is probably a good primer to get started on.  And for those who love Africa, I think the book is a wonderulf journey.	2003-07-19

Having said that, both kids that read the book loved them and were eagerly awaiting the sequel.  The squel definitely was not as well written as the first (but that's an adult point of view and my friend's kids didn't really think so....), and Colfer must have read some of his reviews, because he did seem to put more effort into include more positive themes for the kids, which is good.

I am so enthralled by the characters in the book, I just couldn't put it down.

Yes, as Harry's evil cousin, maybe.  As an adult, I enjoyed the book, but I'm not sure I would want my children to read this.  The premise and characters are interesting, yes, but some of the themes in the book like: greed is a good thing, deceiving is OK as long as its a means to an end and money makes the world go around - I found a little disturbing.  Aren't today's children already too fixated on possessions and money?  I'm not sure if I'm over reacting, but especially compared to Harry Potter, these themes stick out so obviously in this book.  I prefer Harry.	2002-06-14

I am part Japanese and was intrigued by a modern novel with a slice of Japanese plot.  This novel, which basically is 9 stories in one, started out brilliantly.  The Japanese portion is well-researched, well-written and amazing in the way the author captures some of the unwritten and taboo themes in Japanese society - teenage antagonism towards society, growing issue of mixed children fathered by Japanese businessmen and Philppino prostitutes, break down of family values and young adult's work ethic, just to mention a few.  It is probably the best and most realistic portrayal of Japanese society I have read to date.  I was hooked and in awe.  The stories set in Hong Kong, China and St. Petersberg were also gripping and enjoyable.  I liked how he wove the Japanese plot with the Hong Kong plot.  For me it was pretty much the last 2 stories that killed the book.  Somewhere the author fell off the edge of the cliff and went gaga.  Maybe I just don't have the literary appreciation?  I don't know.  I have just asked my husband to read the book and tell me if I'm gaga or not.	2002-06-14

It is very innovative and refreshing to read such a well written story.<br />They story revolves around a possible 36th Vermeer painting - there are only 35 in known existence. Vreeland makes the painting, in a sense, the main character and whole book revolves around the people that have been touched by it.  I don't want to give too much away, because I read it without knowing anything about the book and that makes the unfolding of the story extra special.<br />I like the compactness of the story, but was amazed by the writing.

In fact, reading some of the Tamil was fun.<br />I had a bit of difficulty getting into the book at first, but by about a quarter of the way into the story, I was hooked.  The characters are very vivid and likeable and Davidar's ability to intertwine current events and Indian history into the lives of his characters is uncanny - withouth sounding like a history lesson.

Being half Asian, it is great to not only see a leading Asian character, but also see someone capture the Asian culture and essence so well.

Being half Japanese, the \\"Japanese\\" aspect of this book annoyed me to no end - can one be more cliche?  Don't waste your time or moeny reading or buying this book.  If you want an excellent Japanese murder mystery (although both writers I mentioned can be classified as excellent murder mystery writers even outside of Japan), look for books by the two authors I mentioned above.	2002-05-13

Base's pictures are so awesome, everytime you open the book, you see something you haven't seen before.  Kids just love them!  The added code mystery at the end is also fascinating and challenging for kids - but probably 7 years+ in age, if they want to solve it.  A great way to get kids into reading!	2002-05-12

I have always been fascinated by codes and Singh has put together a comprehensive book on the history of codes.  Having read many books on codes, Singh was still able to enthrall me with some historical stories that I had not come across.  It's not just technical stuff, but is written with the novice in mind as well.  But the book holds enough technical information to keep the enthusiast interested as well.  The version I bought has a crypt contest in the back, which I enjoyed working on - I was only able to solve the first 3 or so puzzles, but it was a lot of fun.	2002-05-12

When I told my mother, who is Japanese, that I had found a great Japanese mystery writer.  She was shocked.  Her response was \\"I read his books when I was young!\\".  But we both had to agree that Matsumoto Seicho was a classic murder mystery writer.  Just classic - people don't write mysteries like that anymore.  He has written so many books, I wish more would be translated into English.  If you are not a Japan-phile, you will enjoy this book emensely!	2002-04-25

John Thaw was the perfect Inspector Morse and thinking back at reading this book, makes me so sad that both Inspector Morse and John Thaw have passed on.	2002-04-25

But after having read it, I couldn't figure out why?  Why was this book translated?  There are so many amazing Japanese writers, why does another bizarre Japanese writer have to be translated.  It makes me wonder what people think of Japanese writers when they read these kinds of books. For me he is in the same bizarre and waste of space category as Murakami.	2002-04-25

Yes, the story is interesting and research amazing.  However, the characters were too flat and the plot too obvious.  What happened to the great plot, twist, shock?  I am sorry to say that I was disappointed with this book - but do highly recommend his other books!	2002-04-25

However, I was very disappointed at this latest book, which has an interesting premise and is obviously thoroughly researched.  But the characters are flat and the plot obvious.  What happened to all the exciting twists and shocks?	2002-04-25

This novel together with Vikram Seth's \\"A Suitable Boy\\" are my most favorite novels.  Ghosh follows the tale of a family through three generations, ups and downs, wars, civil disturbance, love and death - until present day Burma.  The end is a little bit rushed, but doesn't take away from the overall feel of the book.	2002-04-25

I was intrigued enough to go out and buy the book during a recent trip to Malaysia and even more excited after reading the book.  The subject is unlike any story I have read - it takes place around two boys that make it big in the comic business, during the ups and downs of WWII, Europe and New York.  The characters are amazing and the writing flowing nicely.  It is nice to just accidentally pick up such a book and enjoy it so much.	2002-04-25

The writing is not as gripping and more scientific - at times I felt like I had to really force myself to read some sections.  However, the story of the sphinx (whatever that may be....) is fascinating and wish more research could be done by scientists of different kinds of genre to find out more!	2001-09-30

Inspector Rebus is the main character, who lives and works in Edinburgh and like many leading investigators not only has marital and relationship problems, but has issues with authority and following rules.  OK, so far that doesn't sound too exciting, but the story itself is very gripping and has many twists and turns - you can't blieve who the culprit is!  I am now very much hooked on Rankin and have bought 2 of his other books (as a starter!).	2001-09-30

I mentioned Graham Hancock to some archeologists I was staying with during a recent visit to Cairo and they fobbed him off as irrelevant and amateurish.  However, I found his ideas and thoughts amazingly thought-provoking and having visited many of the places that Hancock analyses in his book found it even more fascinating.	2001-09-30

Not so much based on Bletchley Park (as most of the codebreaker books about Britain), this book gives an intriguing insider's look into the day-to-day happenings and life of a codebreaker.  It isn't always simple codebreaking and beating the enemy - its bureaucracy and sometimes the enemy is within your agency!  This is not the book to read if you want precise historical analysis, it is more a supplementary book after you have read more academic books on the subject (I recommend Singh's &quot;Codebreakers&quot;).  This book can make you laugh outloud (like I did on the trans-pacific plane ride) as well as make you almost cry at times.  Leo Marks does a great job at keeping the story realistic-feeling - this is not a James Bond book.	2000-12-08
