That's a matter of opinion.	The idea behind this book is that hikers in Washington's North Cascades, defined in this book as north of Stevens Pass/U.S. Route 2 to the Canadian border, primarily want to see scenic panoramas as distinct from primeval forest, lakes, rivers, birds and wildlife.  If that's your primary goal then this hiking guide that describes 110 outings (25 mostly-short backpacks and the rest day hikes) may prove helpful.    For each hike there is a chatty opinion section telling why the authors liked or disliked the hike followed by a facts section providing a brief summary of how to get there and, in a general sense, how to follow the route.  The authors rate each hike with a 1-4 boot print rating (1 = Don't Do and 4 = Premier).    Ironically the authors ridicule hikes they deem not scenic enough for the summer season but recommend them as so-called shoulder season hikes that present forested lower elevation waterways as a good thing to do when snow still blocks high country trails.  Well, duh...  Fully a third of the backpacks are rated \\"Don't Do\\" which makes me wonder why the authors don't suggest more recommended hikes.    I've hiked the majority of these trips and generally agree with the authors' assessment but not their conclusions.  The fact is it's not possible to do many multi-day hikes in the North Cascades without traversing forested valleys that connect the higher elevation scenic gems.  And many memorable trips, especially in the inevitable inclement weather common to the North Cascades, are memorable for the subtleties of forested wilderness and bodies of water as opposed to the grandeur of sweeping panoramas.    There is a detailed index of place names, three pages of official park and forest  information sources with phone numbers (but few specific web listings), unremarkable b&w photographs and no large scale maps.  A helpful introductory section for people unfamiliar with the region provides cautionary information about bears, cougars, noxious insects, etc.	2005-08-08
US	52492795	R3Q15RGARMT6T6	0743226712	53542661	1776	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Inspiring, entertaining and sobering	Historian David McCullough traces the course of the American Revolution through the torturous first year of organized warfare between the rag tag Continental Army and the largest army and naval force expeditionary launched to that date by Great Britain, the greatest colonial military power in the world. <br /> <br />This book is not about the great ideas and statesmanship that surrounded the era of the Declaration of Independence.  It's about the dirty, bloody nitty-gritty of translating the notion of independence into actuality by means of armed conflict.  1776 traces the months from late-1775 through 1776 when military initiate and success seesawed back and forth.  The Americans first force British forces, along with hundreds of sympathetic New England Tories, to abandon Boston.  Then superior British forces outmaneuver and outfight the colonials to capture New York City.  Finally after being driven in retreat across New Jersey the supposedly beaten Continental Army counterattacks in December 1776 to defeat British forces at Trenton and elsewhere.  Although not militarily decisive, the December attacks have a Tet Offensive-like impact on the British who figured they had already beaten the rebels but are shocked to learn the Americans are too stupid to realize they've been beaten. <br /> <br />McCullough's unvarnished description of ill-disciplined, bawdy, drunken American soldiers is humbling to read but their repeated ability to hold their own, and even occasionally prevail, against better armed, better fed and clothed and better trained and disciplined British/Hessian troops is both heartening (to Americans) and cautionary (again, to Americans) in reflecting on the success of subsequent anti-colonial \\"rebels\\" and \\"insurgents\\", many with goals less ideal than those of America's Founding Fathers. <br /> <br />1776 is well crafted, entertaining, thought provoking and highly recommended to students of American and world history and current events. <br />	2005-08-08

I am also familiar with the history of the forcible domination of Middle Eastern and North African Christian and Jewish societies by Islamic hoards launched by the Mohammed himself, the 800 year Islamic domination of Spain , the brutal Islamic domination of Orthodox Christian societies in Greece and the Balkans until less than 100 years ago and the despicable treatment of non-Muslims in every Islamic-majority country down to the present.  <br /> <br />So what?  Well...  I am constantly and increasingly amazed and dismayed how many friends and acquaintances, many with postgraduate educations, have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA what Islamic societies are actually like (subjugation of women, honor killings, etc.) or that any of the events I describe above actually occurred.  Just a week ago an intelligent, educated friend who often visits Europe said words to the effect, \\"Yes, yes, Islamic terror is awful but didn't we start it all with the Crusades?\\"  I was appalled he had no awareness that the Crusades were a much-too-late response to Muslims overrunning the Holy Land 500 years earlier or anything about the historic Islamic quest for world dominance at the expense of all other belief and social systems. <br /> <br />The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (and the Crusades) is a useful \\"second opinion\\" about to Islamic dogma, thought,  tradition and history for those have only heard the version presented by PBS, the BBC and various Islamic apologists.  It will enlighten any non-Muslim who wants to understand what Jihad is all about.  While arguably superficial by necessity because Spencer covers so much ground in a relatively small space, it provides enough information for most people.  This book can also serve as an introduction for those inclined toward deeper study of religious, historical and comparative social analysis books that treat Islamic topics more comprehensively. <br /> <br />I'm buying copies of this book to give to friends and business associates who need this information.  The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (and the Crusades) should be on the desk of President Bush and every one of his cabinet officers. <br /> <br />	2005-08-02

Although seemingly a coffee table book, it is also a good reference for many blanket patterns.  <br /> <br />From the earliest says of interactions between Europeans and Native Americans blankets played a major role in trans-cultural trade. The manufactured woolen blankets were thicker, warmer and more colorful than traditional Indian blankets laboriously made from woven animal hair. The colorful patterns became particularly important to the Indians who relied on the blankets as \\"robes\\" or overcoats for social occasions and ceremonies. The Indians draped the blankets over their shoulders and held them in place by clasping the edges together with one hand. Antique blankets that were actually used by an Indian will be heavily worn at the location where the edges were grasped.  <br /> <br />The trade blanket is a rare instance of a positive, mutually beneficial collaboration between European Americans and Native Americans. The Indians received a superior product that enhanced their lives and the Europeans responded by developing patterns derived from, but not really replicating, traditional Indian decorative themes. Pendleton still manufactures these blankets and nearly half are still purchased by Native Americans.  <br /> <br />The book contains 60 full-page or two-page color photographs of classic trade blankets, presumably from the collection of Dale Chihuly, the famous Seattle glass artist. There are also 24 classic black and white photographs that show Indians wearing trade blankets in the late 1800s and early 1900s. And there are large color photographs of wonderful trade blanket-inspired glass art Mr. Chihuly created.  <br /> <br />The text includes essays by Mr. Chihuly on collecting blankets and how the blankets influenced his art. There is also an essay by an historian on thehistory of the blankets, their manufacturers and trading them with the Indians from the 1600s to the present.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended to anyone interested in Native American history or folk arts in general. There is an outstanding image-keyed index to the blankets, classic photos and glass art.  <br /> <br />	2005-06-03

Despite not liking to shop at Wal-Mart myself I don't have any stronger feelings against them than against other \\"big box\\" stores such as Home Depot, Target, K-Mart or Lowe's.  As far as I'm concerned they're all temples of materialism that blight the landscape and cause traffic jams.<br /><br />So what's wrong with Wal-Mart in particular?  Bill Quinn, the curmudgeon author of this blog-like diatribe, relies on unnamed sources, data (some of it improbable) without references and lots of anecdotes that may or may not be true.  His redundant message is that the Bentonville blankety-blanks, as he repeatedly refers to Wal-Mart, possesses the (in)human characteristics of \\"evil\\" and \\"greed\\" and manages, apparently thorough some satanic process, to violate the laws of economics and simultaneously treat all employees, vendors AND customers like dirt and single handedly destroy small town America's utopia-like \\"mom and pop\\" main street commerce (whatever that meant in the 1990s after decades of Sears, K-Mart, etc.).<br /><br />But every so-called shady or dirty tactic the author singles out to revile Wal-Mart with is practiced in some form by all aggressive, professional retailers.  And do so-called \\"mom and pop\\" stores always provide health insurance and pay more than minimum wage?  Hardly.  And if vendors and service suppliers lose money selling to Wal-Mart then 1) why did they sign the deal and 2) why are they selling to Wal-Mart more than once?  These complaints make no sense.<br /><br />Quinn's suggestions for \\"fighting\\" Wal-Mart range from common sense (storekeepers update your business skills) to ineffective (letters to the editor) to improbable (running for political office).  This moonbat even suggests such retro-60s touches as forming a protest to chant (I'm not kidding here) \\"one, two, three, four, we don't want your lousy store.\\"<br /><br />Quinn is a fanatic.  He sums up by writing, \\"The long and the short of it for me is, Ihate Wal-Mart.\\"  And that, in essence, is all he says in 171 pages with lots of white space that reads like it was written over a long weekend and is six years out of date.<br /><br />If you're a Wal-Mart hater you might enjoy this.  Otherwise save your money and fight Wal-Mart by spending the same amount on something fun at a \\"mom and pop\\" store.  Or from Wal-Mart or an Internet retailer, whichever you like, because in America we're not only free to say what we want but we're free to shop where we want.<br /><br />No index, no references for many key assertions, no new information since 1999.	2005-06-03
US	52492795	R15ZGE8AD87JXN	0192835149	668628608	The Call of the Wild, White Fang, and Other Stories (Oxford World's Classics)	Books	4	2	4	N	N	Great stories with a few odd elements	I'm reviewing a shorter compilation of Jack London stories not currently available on Amazon, but all of the stories are also in this book. <br /> <br />I bought the book to revisit the \\"cold weather stories\\" such as Call of the Wild and To Build a Fire while holed up last winter in my snowy mountain redoubt.  I enjoyed the cold adventures and descriptions of living and working outdoors in subzero weather before the era of goose down, Thinsulate, Gore-Tex and nylon.  I was not too surprised to learn my recollection of these stories that I first encountered forty-odd years ago was not particularly accurate (not unlike other distant memories I investigate) and I enjoyed reading them. <br /> <br />Having said that, a lot of these stories are downright DEPRESSING...London was a well regarded writer and commercial success in his short lifetime.  But he was apparently a tormented person, driven to alcohol and suicide by age 40.  His dark view of human nature and the need for and desirability of radical socialist revolution is a theme of several stories.  One of them, The Dream of Debs, fantasizes about a bazaar socialist rebellion in San Francisco.  The \\"working class\\" secretly colludes to hide away food for themselves and then calls a general strike that brings the \\"ruling class\\" to its knees by imminent starvation.  The result is that everyone gets their pre-strike jobs back with greatly improved income and working conditions for all the strikers.  It never occurs to London, apparently a \\"true believer\\", that some of the \\"rulers\\" might not reopen their businesses as they would lose money or that they would cover their increased costs by raising prices to the workers' detriment as consumers.  Oddly, London could not fathom that his story's affluent protagonist would do anything after the strike except rehire his house full of domestic servants at much increased wages, even welcoming back those who stole his food and abandoned him to battle starvation.  Weird... <br /> <br />Nevertheless, these stories are well written with vivid, pithy language, colorful descriptions and surprising plot twists.  They are excellent reading for would-be writers of all ages and, at least regarding the \\"traditional\\" stories, are excellent tales of heroic adventure in the frigid late-19th century north country. <br /> <br />	2005-05-09
US	52492795	R2ATIYHXUQNOZ2	0671792172	226539248	Pacific Campaign: The U.S.-Japanese Naval War 1941-1945	Books	4	24	26	N	N	Good overview	The most interesting and useful part of this book for most people may be the first 113 pages that describe events preceding Pearl Harbor as Japan, starting with their annexation of Formosa in 1895, maneuvered for two generations toward war with the United States. <br /> <br />Published in 1991, author van der Vat pays no homage to \\"the greatest generation\\" who fought the war in the lower ranks but focuses on their parents' generation, men largely born before 1895, who, sometimes wisely and sometimes not, actually strategized the war and lead the U.S. to Victory (Roosevelt, King, Nimitz, Halsey, MacAuthur, et al).  The profiles of significant senior Japanese officers will be new to many Americans.  Also, the author makes a good case that the two pronged assault toward Japan, MacArthur through the Solomons and Philippines and Nimitz through the Marshalls, Marianas, etc., was a poor strategy that needlessly prolonged the war by dividing Allied resources. <br /> <br />Another interesting aspect is the fanatical, even suicidal, attitude of so many Japanese both before the war and during pitched battles.  This lead the U.S. to conclude that the only way to get them to stop fighting, either on a remote atoll or on their home islands, was to apply ever greater firepower.  It sounds in some ways like the philosophy and practice of the Islamic supremacists the U.S. is fighting in recent and current times. <br /> <br />A few interesting tidbits were new to me.  For example, the famous Normandy D-Day landing was not the largest or even the second largest single-day U.S. amphibious assault of the war; the largest was on Luzon in the Philippines and the second largest was on Okinawa.  The first B-29 raid of the war was against Japanese forces in Bangkok.  The Japanese killed 250,000 Chinese civilians in reprisal for (very little) Chinese support of the 1942 Doolittle (Thirty Second Over Tokyo) air raid.  And, things never change, a U.S. congressman blabbed in a press conference that during a \\"fact finding trip\\" to the Pacific Theater he learned that the Japanese were failing to sink U.S. submarines because they were setting their depth charges to explode at too shallow a depth; the Japanese picked this up and thereafter improved their ability to sink our subs...  Finally the Japanese had a significant atomic weapons program dating from before 1942 and one of their principal development sites, captured and dismantled by the Russians, was in what is now North Korea (!?). <br /> <br />This 429-page book is recommended as a \\"refresher\\" for someone who is familiar with the general facts of WWII in the Pacific but is vague on the specifics or someone with no prior knowledge who wants to learn the details (units, ships, commanders) of the principal campaigns and battles. <br /> <br />The maps could be better and the photos are mostly well know from elsewhere. <br />	2005-05-05

The \\"problem\\" illustrated by this 278-page non-fiction book is the increasing contact between humans and mountain lions (cougar, puma, whatever...) in the Western United States. <br /> <br />Baron focuses on the encroachment of the big cats into urban Boulder, CO in the 1990s with a consequent tragic result for both cougars and people.  The lion/human interactions escalate from the occasional urban sighting - at first denied by wildlife authorities - to cougars killing deer within city boundaries to killing pets to killing farm animals to stalking and threatening humans to, finally, an incident in which a lion kills a high school student athlete as he runs in broad daylight on a hillside above his school. <br /> <br />This tale, with lots of footnoted references, also tracks the efforts of a Boulder parks department employee who, from his experience with people being killed by wildlife in Yellowstone NP, recognizes the growing potential for a deadly cougar/human encounter.  But he can't convince state game officials to take the problem seriously, partly because game department officials believe Boulder brought the problem on themselves by allowing deer, the cougar's favorite food, to proliferate far beyond normal population density by the city's anti-hunting bias.  Apart from the dead high school student, there are cautionary tales about a college-age woman who is treed (yes!) by cougars while running in a suburban area and an adult male attacked and injured on a popular day hike. <br /> <br />But other than recoding and mapping the locations of cougar/human encounters - which Washington state just passed a law requiring - what can be done to avoid cougars becoming habituated to (i.e., not fearful of) people with the eventual conclusion on their part that humans are valid prey?  Nobody knows. <br /> <br />Baron's book is well written, entertaining and educational.  My only complaints are about the author's occasional rambles into non-relevant aspects of some of thecharacters' lives and the lack of photographs.  There's one photo of a cougar track in the snow (good to memorize if you live in or visit cat country!) and one of a cougar shot by Boulder police.  But in a book which goes into depth about several characters I'd like to see pictures of them as well as some of the locations where incidents occurred. <br /> <br />Recommended for anyone interested in North American wildlife or anyone living in \\"cougar country\\", which currently is most any place in the Western United States. <br />	2005-05-04

There really aren't too many so-called dirty little secrets revealed and most of the material is not controversial, but the book does have a lot of interesting perspectives and factual data re the war.  Eschewing the chronological approach Dunnigan and Nofi write a lot of short interesting chapters on everything from a sketch of the pre-U.S. involvement history of conflict in Vietnam and adjoining nations (which still continues as the growing ethnic Vietnamese population continues suppressing and displacing minority groups) to summaries of each aspect of combat (Army, USMC, helicopters, air war, Naval campaigns (perhaps the weakest section), etc.), descriptions of major actions and incidents and overviews of in-country \\"cultural\\" issues (drugs, racial relations, popular music, etc.). <br /> <br />One hallmark is lots of statistics on various topics (casualties, military demographics, air craft, weapons used, etc.).  Most of these are from official sources and source references - increasing lacking in much today's politicized nonfiction - are provided.  Some of the statistics are explained and provide illustrative insights but unfortunately some of the intriguing data are not well explained. <br /> <br />For instance, there's a general impression that surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) were the overwhelming danger to U.S. aircraft and air-to-air combat was a significant aspect of the war.  But the authors present statistics which show that only 11% of aircraft lost in combat were lost to SAMs, 4% were lost in air-to-air combat while the remaining 76% were lost to anti-aircraft artillery and various conventional ground-based weapons fire.  However, the authors don't clarify that many, if not most, of aircraft losses occurred over South Vietnam where SAMs and MIGs were not available to our adversaries.  The 25% rate of US Navy loss to SAMs and MIGs compared with only 12% for USAF/USMC presumably reflects that the Navy operated relatively more over North Vietnam itself from Tonkin Gulf-based carriers while the USAF/USMC operated a larger percentage pf their fixed wing aircraft over the South. <br /> <br />Another fascinating tidbit are the statistics about deserters who accepted amnesty in the mid-1970s - many of whom had gone to Canada - showing they were disproportionately (86%) in the lowest two classifications out of four military intelligence test classifications.   <br /> <br />A suggested reading list, multi-page glossary and extensive indexing give what is basically an entertaining read for military history buffs who are not expert on Vietnam a bit of extra value as a reference for further study. <br /> <br />Recommended for Vietnam War, Cold War and general military history buffs and is an excellent book about the Vietnam-era for people not even born before the war ended. <br /> <br />Reviewed on the 30th anniversary of the fall of Saigon. On April 29, 1975, Radio Saigon began playing Bing Crosby's \\"White Christmas\\" (an interesting fact NOT mentioned in this book) as a signal to begin Operation Frequent Wind, the evacuation of all American personnel from South Vietnam. <br /> <br />	2005-04-30

This well written, fast paced books relates the story of a middle class Afghan family a year after American-led forces liberated the country from the Taliban.  The incidents and anecdotes are told to and witnessed by a female Norwegian journalist, Asne Seierstad, who lived with the family for three months. <br /> <br />Other reviewers have described the overall book well, especially the systematic oppression of women in the pursuit of some ideal - for who? - Islamic purity.  But the author's anecdotes also illustrates why most Islamic economies are immune to advancing the welfare of their own people. <br /> <br />Sultan, the Kahn family patriarch who lets Seierstad observe and write about his family, is a merchant straight out of the medieval caravan era.  Most of what he sells, using his uneducated sons and relatives as indentured servants to operate his bookstores, consists of Iranian and Pakistani produced merchandise exorbitantly marked up in price because he benefits from having little or no competitive market.  While piously professing a desire to modernize Afghanistan he steadfastly refuses to invest anything is his country's economy or even in his own sons.  Consider how unfavorably this compares with how East Asian patriarchs invest in their own economies, businesses and families. <br /> <br />Sultan's eldest son Mansur, a semi-educated seventeen year old, meekly submits to being treated like a dog by his father but whenever his father is away copies his father's tyranny and abuses his aunts, sisters and even his loving mother - telling her to \\"go to hell\\" when she says something Mansur doesn't like - , every chance he gets.  But the telling thing is just how lazy and irresponsible the misogynistic little wimp is when his father is not there to threaten him.  When Sultan goes to Tehran on business for a month he gives Mansur several tasks to complete - cataloging inventory, picking up shipments, dealing with charges against a thief - but Mansur fritters theentire month away reveling in freedom from his father's control and fails to complete even a single task.  This is typical of punishment-driven Islamic culture where most people only do what someone forces them to do and accomplish nothing without supervision so that little improvement is made without reliance on the hated infidels or other foreigners. <br /> <br />The author relates the Kahn family stories and lets the events speak for themselves.  But in an epilogue describing how family members became estranged after her departure Seierstad tells how frustrated and appalled she was with how Sultan, a man she initially perceived as sophisticated and \\"liberal\\", treated his family, especially the women.  She relates that she bit her tongue many times to avoid comparing their behavior and customs unfavorably to the (superior in her view) way things work in her native Norway. <br /> <br />Ironically Ms. Seierstad, who generously, and perhaps naively, donates the profit from this book to the Afghan education system, may be spending too much time in the Middle East to realize that Islamic culture is changing Norway and Scandinavia more than Norway and Scandinavia are changing Islam.  For example, the Swedish company IKEA recently bowed to demands by Islamic Scandinavian immigrants and reissued all their product instruction manuals to avoid offending Muslims by depicting women assembling everything from cupboards to beds.  The new manuals show only men or cartoon figures whose sex is unclear.  And in recent years there has been a surge in rapes and gang rapes in Norway attributed to Islamic men, mostly Kurds.  In their trials the Muslims invariably claim as their defense that the Norwegian women dress too provocatively.  Unbelievably, some Norwegian elites, including a senior judge and a female university professor, agree and have publicly said that Norwegian women should dress more conservatively so as not to offend the cultural sensibilities of Islamic immigrants.  And some of the largest, but vacant, churches in post-Christian Oslo are being converted to mosques.  Sultan Kahn may yet have the last laugh on Ms. Seierstad as Europe converts itself to Eurabia in the next twenty years. <br /> <br />This book is recommended as a well written bit of \\"new journalism\\" with colorful stories and harrowing descriptions about contemporary life in Afghanistan. <br />	2005-04-30

The is little or no discussion of theological aspects of each character but rather an effort to gather known facts and references from disparate sources about each man (no female characters are covered) in an effort to provide an account of their probable life story, particularly after Christ's crucifixion.  It is particularly interesting to learn about the evidence of travel and missions for the lesser known apostles and explanations and theories about Apostolic journeys to India.  McBirnie tries to stay with verifiable facts and sources that are considered historically reliable rather than speculate too much about unknown or unknowable matters. <br /> <br />Following 44 pages of general background on the early Christian era and available historic sources McBirnie provides a chapter each for 19 men in 250 pages.  That is followed by an appendix listing New Testament references for each character, five-page bibliography and a seven-page index. <br /> <br />I did not find the author is be as negative regarding relics, etc., as some other reviewer do. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book and recommend it an entertaining read as well as Christian study reference. <br />	2005-03-16

And the Europeans who many of us like to think of as so relatively advanced at that time turn out to have inferior vessels and skills to many of the Chinese and Arabian vessels they encounter in the Spice Islands. <br /> <br />Magellan rises to a high position in the Portuguese nautical establishment, which was more advanced than the Spanish at the time, but then falls into political disfavor that frustrates his vision of circumnavigating the Earth.  It's amazing how quickly he manages to convince the Spanish king to back him, although the Spanish always view him and other Portugese in the crew with suspicion.  Although it was corrupt and causes Magellan delays and frustrations, the account of the Spanish bureaucracy that regulates shipping and exploration is fascinating.  It sounds incredibly \\"modern\\" in its scope and methods. <br /> <br />The most disheartening aspect of the story is how brutal Magellan and many of the others are to his own crew, South American Indians and some of the people they encounter in what is now the Philippines and Indonesia.  Some of the brutality is arguably necessary by the norms of the day to maintain order and discipline.  But the killing and mutilation of the locals seems not only criminally arbitrary but counter productive to the explorers' own interests. <br /> <br />The book is well written, entertaining and highly recommended. <br />	2005-03-16

Harden's approach is a well crafted, articulate chronology of events interspersed among interviews with then-still-living civil engineers and workers who built the dams (including the author's father), self-described redneck barge crews, American Indians, irrigator farmers, nuclear engineers, supposed \\"downwind\\" victims of nuclear engineers, wildlife management officials and environmental activists. Oddly, he never interviews any significant politician, and he describes the actions of civil service engineers and bureaucrats as if they built this multi-billion dollar project over forty years on their own fanatic authority, sort of like renegade CIA agents supposedly taking over a jungle-clad third world country without anyone telling them to. <br /> <br />The gist of A River Lost is that beginning in 1933 and ending in the 1970s, Federal and quasi-Federal agencies, acting under the direction of six presidents, converted one of the world's largest and wildest rivers into an all-but-completely tamed series of lakes behind hydroelectric dams. The result is a massive amount of inexpensive electricity, irrigation for more than 500,000 acres of farmland, an economical means to transport commodities from an interior desert toward Asian markets and, totally unplanned by its originators, a means to produce plutonium for atomic bombs that ended World War II and armed the U.S. in the Cold War. The most negative side effect was the virtual destruction of the Columbia's unimaginably immense migrating salmon population along with a traumatically negative impact on remnant groups of American Indians dependent on the salmonfor sustenance and culture. <br /> <br />Harden makes a pretty good case that farmers and industries who benefited from the Columbia River industrialization only repaid a small fraction of the cost, Indians were not consulted, respected or compensated, billions of dollars were lost on an ill-conceived nuclear power project and there's been a lot of environmental damage, primarily to salmon and other fish populations, as well as possible damage to human health. As unpleasant as it may be for some of the \\"bad guys\\" in this saga to acknowledge I think the basic story is accurate. But as for Harden's expos of unfairness, corruption, self dealing and unforeseen or unconsidered negative impacts... and from a government program!... how shocking! <br /> <br />Well, not really. A similar narrative could be constructed about virtually every large-scale government economic development and social engineering project since the 1930s: other river development schemes, so-called urban renewal, interstate highways, War on Poverty, public education system, etc., etc., etc. All of those programs have winners, losers and, typically, unintended, unacknowledged or uncompensated environmental, health or social costs. Such is the nature of government programs, but nobody seems able to resist them. <br /> <br />To me the most interesting aspect of this book is how Harden characterizes, or declines to characterize, the political affiliation of key players. <br /> <br />The initial Grande Coulee project and its unthinking destruction of salmon runs and Indian culture in the name of New Deal progress, and later the atomic city at Hanford, all occurred under President Franklin Roosevelt. Harden tells us that after WWII the remainder of the dam building, salmon and Indian destruction, sweetheart deals for farmers, barge operators, electrical utilities, et al, were driven through Congress, no matter who was president, by two powerful Washington senators, Magnuson and Jackson. The two senators were each in office about 40 years, and Harden refers to them ten times, asserting they abetted much sweetheart dealing, environmental damage and so forth. But Harden doesn't identify Roosevelt, Magnuson or Jackson as Democrats. <br /> <br />Then, with all the dams built, all the subsidies enshrined, all the salmon dying and Magnuson and Jackson gone from the scene, an environmentalist-led \\"Salmon War\\" heats up in the early 1980s. That's when newly elected Washington Senator Gorton appears in the same paragraph where Harden refers to \\"evil... political games\\" and - finally! - Harden fearlessly dares put a name to regressive forces that refuse to right wrongs wrought by half a century of dam, irrigation and atomic energy programs. We learn Senator Gorton is a... a... a... Republican!!!!! And when Gorton reappears in the story Harden tells us once again, in case we missed it, that Gorton is (still!) a Republican. <br /> <br />Things get worse again for salmon because, as Harden tells it, a mean Republican is elected to replace a nice Democrat as governor of neighboring Idaho. Apparently it's no problem, because its unmentioned by Harden, that Democrats almost always governed much larger Washington where most of the salmon's problem is located. Anyway, we learn that although Democrats controlled congress for about 56 of the first 60 years of the Columbia River development things only become hopeless for the fish when, just before Harden completes the book, Republicans take control of Congress in 1994.  Did I mention Harden is a Washington Post reporter? <br /> <br />My own postscript is that in the ten years since Harden wrote A River Lost irrigators' fortunes declined as foreign producers undercut even their subsidized costs. The aluminum industry imploded. Communities Harden characterizes as terminally whitebread are increasingly dominated by Mexican immigrants. The Colville Indians who lost prime fishing grounds to Grand Coulee Dam now benefit from its cheap electricity because they own the largest lumber processing mill in Okanogan County as well as three well-lit casinos in the Columbia Basin. And some Eastern Washington counties now spend more on fish habitat restoration than human health care. <br /> <br />A River Lost has excellent sketch maps throughout each section that help place people and events. There are nine pages of footnotes and sources and thirteen pages of index. But as far as I can tell there's no mention to which political party Franklin Roosevelt, the guy who started the whole thing, belonged. <br /> <br />	2005-03-16

I've made quite a few of the recipes and can report they are easy to follow, reproduce good results and give budding BLF types some badly needed ideas for sticking to the nutrition part of their Challenge.  Several recipes are outstanding; my personal favorites being Mom's Chicken Enchiladas and Turkey Sloppy Joes, while some are unappealing to my taste which is par for the course with any cookbook.  One unique aspect for BFL buffs are 69 useful pages in the front that explain \\"Eating for Life Facts\\", and in the back are another 54 pages with a section of recipes and comments from typically inspiring BFL Challenge winners, two weeks of BFL meal plans using recipes from the book, and some useful basic cooking tips for neophyte chefs. <br /> <br />Now, three warnings:  First, quite a few \\"recipes\\", perhaps 5%-10% of the total, are really BFL meal/snack suggestions that don't need a color page of instructions (e.g., half a cantaloupe and cottage cheese or two sliced hardboiled eggs with a sliced orange).  More problematic is that there is absolutely NO nutritional data - e.g., calories, protein/carbohydrate/fat mix, etc. - for the recipes.  This is particularly disappointing because even cookbooks that don't claim to support a physical transformation program often have this information.  Yes, I realize BFL emphasizes controlling portion size rather than calorie counting, but I'm a little suspicious that many recipes are heavy on the carbo side of the protein/carbo equation because so many have bread, tortillas or pasta which Mr. Phillips normally discourages.  Along this same line many recipes are \\"comfort-food\\" to most Americans that rely on some form of cheese, sauces or dressing; without taking GREAT care to use fat-free ingredients these will easilybecome comfortably negative component of one's physical transformation. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to people looking for recipes that combine the BFL protein/carbo philosophy with basic American-palate-friendly family type home cooking.  But to avoid blowing your BFL Challenge you'll need to be VERY careful about ingredient choices and focus intensely on portion control, which is the ultimate key to BFL nutrition success. <br />	2005-03-15

Rather it provides an overview of the Royal Navy's submarine operations from the 1960s to the early 1990s by tracing the careers of six Royal Navy officers as they rise from Midshipman to submarine captains and, in some cases, on to Flag rank.    In following their careers we learn about training philosophy and living conditions in the Royal Navy and some of their submarine operations in the Atlantic related the countering the Soviet navy; the development and deployment of Britain's SSBN nuclear deterrent; and operations in Malaysia and elsewhere as the British withdrew from East of Suez.    The most extensive operational descriptions are about the 1982 Falklands War.  According to the author the Argentine Navy prematurely launched its attack on the Falklands, to their disadvantage and the U.K.'s advantage, when a Royal Navy SSN made an unscheduled departure from Gibraltar.  The Argentinians interpreted that event as a sortie to confront them in the South Atlantic, but it actually involved responding to a Soviet action in the North Atlantic.  The stalking and sinking of the (former U.S. Navy) heavy cruiser General Belgrano by HMS Conqueror is covered in detail as are other important contributions by RN SSNs such as surveillance of Argentine airfields to provide early warning of impending air strikes on the British fleet.  There is a tantalizingly brief description of an RN SSK's (diesel-powered submarine) epic 100+ day roundtrip patrol from the UK to Argentina related to commando insertion operations.  The highlight of RN ASW operations is the destruction - in a surface action - of the Argentinian submarine Santa Fe (former USS Catfish).There are 14 pages of black and white photos; an appendix listing of all RN submarines commissioned since 1958 (but no decommissioning dates); a list of all RN \\"Flag Officer Submarines\\" from 1946-2001; a three-page bibliography and an 11-page (really small print!) index.     \\"We Come Unseen\\" is highly recommended to anyone interested in Cold War and other late-Twentieth Century submarine and naval history, the Royal Navy or Cold War politics and military strategy.  Unfortunately for the curious, author Jim Ring doesn't divulge as much classified information as Sonntag and Drew did in \\"Blind Man's Bluff\\" (an SSBN captain asserted to me two years ago that a lot of the classified information in the later was initially divulged to the authors by a member of Congress...).	2004-12-21

Books	4	1	2	N	N	The "WUP, WUP, WUP" of Hueys fills the air again	Dustoff is the self-published memoir of a 20-year-old US Army Warrant Officer's year of combat helicopter pilot MEDEVAC duty in Vietnam (1969-70).  It provides a highly decorated pilot's fascinating perspective on one of the most dangerous and important combat support functions of the war, always told in a modest manner that discusses command politics and leadership issues as well as the combat evacuation adventures.  The author, who went on to an Army career that culminated in the rank of Lt. Colonel, also gives an overview of combat medical evacuation history, philosophy, and techniques; provides a memorial chapter naming more than 200 soldier/airmen who died in Vietnam MEDEVAC operations; presents a technical section with diagrams on the UH-1 helicopter and its rescue hoist.    The book is interestingly and well illustrated with period black & white snapshots, presumably taken by the author and his comrades, that give readers a feel for what it looked like.  Larger scale maps would have helped to better follow the \\"war stories\\".  The text would have benefited from additional proofreading and editing.    The book includes a \\"bonus\\" CD recording of radio conversations from one of the author's actual 1969 combat MEDEVAC mission.  It really makes the incident \\"come alive\\" for readers with no such experience, and author seems INCREDIBLY cool in an incredibly stressful situation where he and his crew are hoisting wounded GIs out of the jungle in the middle of a night firefight.      I recommend this book highly as an example of the kind of military memoir that all veterans - not just those with such distinguished combat records as Lt. Col. Vermillion - should prepare for their families and friends.  It is a good read for anyone interested in what it was like in Vietnam, Army helicopter aviation or military medical support operations.	2004-09-08
US	52492795	R22PRL79C200VM	0670872822	356377311	American Colonies (Penguin History of the United States)	Books	5	14	15	N	N	Good review of things I forgot (or maybe never knew)	Taylor provides an extensive - 526 pages including bibliography and index - overview of European colonial initiatives in the Atlantic, North America and parts of the Caribbean from the early 1400s - when Portuguese and Spanish proto-colonists got their feet wet, so to speak, by colonizing the Azores, Canaries and Medeiras - through Spanish and Russian efforts on the West Coast in the early 1800s.  Substantial space is given to colonial efforts of the French, Dutch, and Spanish as well as English settlement in the eastern Caribbean and the east coast of what eventually became the United States. <br /> <br />A tragic theme throughout the book is the encounter between Europeans and Native Americans that decimated the latter, primarily through inadvertent introduction of diseases but also through warfare, slavery, appropriation of their land and destruction of the environment on which the Indians relied.  Taylor also describes how the Indians repeatedly collaborated with or benefited from European traders and colonists when they perceived - often erroneously - that the Europeans' actions benefited their own economic and strategic interests.  And, yes, the Indians traded in slaves - either other Indians or Africans - as well.  The role and some of the impact of enslaved Africans on Colonial development is also described throughout the book. <br /> <br />Regarding the English colonies that became the original thirteen United States it's helpful for Taylor to remind that most of the colonies had unique beginnings that influenced their cultures and economies and politics for many years after the American revolution.  For example, South Carolina essentially began as a colony of the fabulously wealthy colony of Barbados, and initiated use of enslaved Africans on a scale that dwarfed the Chesapeake tobacco plantations.  And Pennsylvania started relatively late but grew quickly and prosperously as the initial English Quakers were quickly outnumbered by industrious German familyfarmers as opposed to indentures servants or slaves. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Euro-American settlement, the formative history of the United States and the interaction of Europeans with Native Americans. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-08-04

One way to access such older Christian worlds is through the Vintage Spiritual Classics series that makes classical Christian works accessible to believers who often haven't read anything written prior to currently-living Evangelical writers.<br />This is arguably a good introduction to the thoughts and beliefs of early Christian monastics, both male and female.  This is a period all Christians should study since it reflects the origins of most early Christian theology and practice derived from men and women who were sometimes just a generation or two removed from the Apostles.  It helps Christians get in touch with their spiritual roots and offset some of the spiritual nonsense that occupies much of the shelf space in most Christian bookstores.<br />However, I found this relatively thin (221 page) book a disappointment.  First, although it's a first edition for this publisher in 1998, it's actually a reproduction of work translated by a woman who died in 1965 at the age of 76, so who knows when it was actually prepared.  Then, it's a translation of source documents for the stories and sayings, but they're sometimes less than easy to follow or \\"pithy\\" in this format.  One really needs  to dig for the most compelling and enlightening material.  There are a number of more contemporary, extensive and more usefully translated books on the Desert Fathers, a number of which are listed in this book's two-page \\"Suggestions for Further Reading\\", virtually all of which post-date by 10-20 years this book itself.<br />I suggest consulting Orthodox Christian WEB sites and publishers for good summaries, explanations and references for the philosophy, beliefs and practices of the Desert Fathers since the Orthodox denominations are arguably the DesertFathers' direct descendents in today's world.	2004-05-11

This semi-large format book covers all the aircraft used in the Vietnam conflict, with a chapter for 1949-1959 and then a chapter for each year 1960-1975.  In each chapter there are many color and black and white photos, color engineering drawings of important aircraft, descriptions of strategies and tactics, many firsthand war stories and profiles of significant aviators.  The focus is on U.S. Air Force, Army and Navy aircraft, and there're all here: choppers, counterinsurgency craft, recces, patrol and SAR platforms, bombers and fast movers.  There is also relatively limited material on the South and North Vietnamese air forces, North Vietnam's air defense system and neighboring countries' aircraft.  The pre-1965 years, often forgotten, are particularly interesting; did you know that when the French returned after WWII they used some abandoned Japanese military aircraft?<br />Appendices summarize U.S. and South Vietnamese air force order of battle throughout the war, list all carrier deployments and associated carrier air wings from 1964-75, a chronology of all U.S. Mig kills with details for each shoot down (including two by enlisted B-52 .50 cal gunners!), a very useful alphabetical reference with brief technical details for all U.S. and foreign made aircraft used in the theater from 1945-1975, and an excellent index for finding all references and photos for particular aircraft types.<br />Another reviewer asserts \\"there are a lot of errors in the text and captions in this book\\", but fails to provide a single specific example.  There are hundreds of picture captions and hundreds of pages of text, and the material seems consistent with other sources so the bulk of the material must be accurate.  Perhaps that reviewer's particular area of interest or expertise was slighted or had some errors.<br />I enjoyed this book, pull it out to read often and recommend it highly.  It is a \\"must\\" for Vietnam and Cold War history buffs, model aircraft builders and Vietnam vets.	2004-05-11
US	52492795	R1Z5A96VNZ3T0K	0345447069	545444148	Walking to Canterbury: A Modern Journey Through Chaucer's Medieval England	Books	2	37	43	N	N	Not a Much of a Pilgrimage and Not Much of a Story	I have to take exception to most of the other reviews.  Please hear me out.    The author, a man of Native American and English heritage, wrote an earlier book, Walking the Trail, about a several month walk tracing the infamous Cherokee \\"Trail of Tears\\" backward from Oklahoma to his home in northeast Alabama, as well as two other books tracing historic American routes.  Mr. Ellis says his trip to England to follow the medieval Christian pilgrims' route from London to Canterbury Cathedral, described most famously by Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, was an effort to connect with his English heritage.  I finished the book concluding that Ellis' so-called pilgrimage was just a way to provide his publisher with a sequel to sell based on the reputation and success of Ellis' earlier writing.    For someone supposedly seeking to understand his English roots Mr. Ellis invests minuscule effort in the process.  He commits only nine days to his first trip to England:  arrives in London, departs the next day a seven-day, 70-odd mile walk, spends the last night in Canterbury, then returns to London by train to catch a flight back to the U.S.  Such a short trip can't provide enough material for 295 pages, so Ellis pads the book with flashbacks to his Trail of Tears walk  plus a lot of material about medieval English history, customs, daily life and English and non-English Christian practices.  Some of the historic material consists of pages-long quotes from other books.  Mind you, the historic extracts can be interesting, but there are better sources for such things and the book's subtitle promised \\"a modern journey through Chaucer's medieval England.\\"    Ellis focuses on some fairly odd people for someone saying he wants to get in touch with his English heritage.  His most significant encounters are with unemployed, spike-haired, slackers and their pet iguana (he actually tarries an extra day to party with  them), Swedish, French and Dutch tourists, an Iranian immigrant and several bar tenders.  No significant encounters with farmers, police officers or teachers.  And certainly none with Christians.    Ellis' walk is hardly a religious pilgrimage.  His own beliefs are Native American/New Age (i.e., deifying created objects rather than a Creator) and he expresses scant respect for Christianity.  On one occasion Ellis hurts his back when he trips in the forest and experiences excruciating pain.  That night, seemingly for the first time, in desperation he prays for relief.  The next morning he experiences a self-described miraculous healing.  Then, rather than credit God for healing him, and perhaps seeing the occurrence as \\"a sign\\" to repent and complete the trip as a true pilgrimage of thanksgiving as medieval Christians would have, Ellis quickly explains away his healing as a fluke.    Ellis encounters some New Age tourists from Holland.  They are lead by a Dutchman calling himself Geronimo who, for unexplained reasons, came from Amsterdam to England to practice some half-baked version of Native American spirituality in an attempt to relieve urban angst.  Ellis writes: \\"Geronimo's teaching Native American spirituality when he has no such heritage disturbed me.\\"  But a few pages later non-Christian Ellis perceives no hypocrisy in himself when he arrives in Canterbury and, among secular visitors there to see the historic building and its art, makes a spectacle of himself by ascending the Cathedral steps on his knees in imitation of a pious Christian pilgrim.  Afterward Ellis celebrates the conclusion of his \\"pilgrimage\\" at a bar where people mock Christian heritage, then leaves early the next day to rush back to Alabama.    Ellis is a bit of an odd traveler, to boot.  He lugs a 40 pound backpack of camping gear and spends a third of his nights in a tent in the semi-rural landscape, sort of like camping in the suburbs while walking from New York City to someplace in Connecticut.  And he cooks on campfires several times at historic sites and just off the road in scraps of forest and farmers' fields.  I've made walking tours in the British Isles and can tell you people just don't do that sort of thing; most people don't build campfires anymore when they hike in the U.S.  One bit of  quaintness - the trip occurred in 1999 - is Ellis talking about the great pocket knife he always carries and uses to carve figures in his oak walking stick.  Ahhhh, pocket knives.... remember when we were allowed to carry those when we traveled in the good old days before 9-11?    I don't recommend this book.  The stories aren't that good and you can easily find better sources about the history of Canterbury or medieval England.  I bought it because I enjoy making and reading about both Christian and secular pilgrimages, but this isn't, to my disappointment, really a pilgrimage book.    Walking to Canterbury includes a small scale sketch map of the route, some small black-and-white reproductions of medieval scenes, a three-page bibliography of sources used for the historic extracts and a grainy photo of the author.	2004-04-05

US	52492795	R1QQLVMTT3OLD0	1557504032	832776549	Flash Point North Korea: The Pueblo and EC-121 Crises	Books	4	19	19	N	N	Still, Nobody Can Say Why They Did It	This book provides a detailed chronology of the United States' response to the North Korean capture of the USS Pueblo and its crew in January 1968 (1 KIA and 82 POW) and the downing of a USN EC-121 electronic reconnaissance aircraft (31 KIA) on April 1969, less than four months after the release of Pueblo's crew.  It does not recount more than the bare outlines of the two incidents themselves.  I served in a Navy unit in Japan that was the permanent station for two of men killed in the EC-121 shoot down and participated in post-shoot down deployments in that theater during 1969-70.    Commander Mobley traces the U.S. response from Washington and in the Western Pacific to each event.  Both incidents follow the same pattern: 1) initial confusion and inability to respond to the attacks in real time, 2) a rush to deploy military assets into the region, 3) a period of air and naval saber rattling in apparent preparation for retaliatory strikes against North Korea and 4) eventual standing down for a negotiated release of the Pueblo crew and, well, nothing at all for the EC-121 shoot down.  Both events take place against a backdrop of a major war in Vietnam, where South Korea (ROK) and North Korea (KORCOMs) were both involved,.  In both cases the North Koreans took, and won, the calculated gamble that the U.S. would not risk opening a \\"second front\\" in Northeast Asia.  Lame U.S. response to both incidents, especially from the then-new Nixon administration in 1969, illustrate how unprepared the U.S. was (and is?) to engage the North Koreans.  Oddly, in that era the ROK's forces were numerically much stronger than the KORCOM's and their martial governments were seemingly anxious. to attack - they, after all, suffered more casualties than the U.S., plus the KORCOMs tried to kill the ROK president in 1967.    As Mobley describes, but, in my opinion, fails to put into full context, the period from about November 1966 through mid-1969 saw hundreds of actions between KORCOM and both ROK and U.S. forces along the DMZ and along the ocean boundary on both the Sea of Japan and Yellow Sea coasts.  These several hundred firefights are, along with the Pueblo and EC-121 incidents, referred to by participants as the Second Korean War, a small scale war that claimed more than 1,000 ROK and U.S. casualties (the approximately 186 U.S. casualties - 75 KIA and 111 WIA from all services - are a significantly higher casualty RATE than U.S. forces suffered during Desert Storm) and a larger number of KORCOM deaths (most fought to the death rather than be captured).  By treating the Navy incidents as almost totally separate from the U.S. land and ROK land/sea incidents (which were NOT much publicized at the time since the media usually can't handle more than one story at a time, and Vietnam was the big story) Mobley does not capture the feel of the era that participants in-theater experienced.  Also, Mobley glosses over or fails to describe some post-EC-121 U.S. responses in the theater.    Mobley illustrates how the ROK land forces at the time significantly outnumbered estimated KORCOM forces, although the KORCOMs had a numerical advantage in tactical aircraft.  The U.S. air forces were pathetically small - although more could be brought in - and U.S. Army units were under strength, and remained so, due to needs in Vietnam.  The big question remains, \\"What was  North Korea trying to do?\\"  The best Mobley comes up with, and it's as good an answer as anyone else has ever publicly provided, is that it was all related to some internal policy struggle among North Korean elites (hawks v. super hawks?) that died down when the risks began to outweigh the perceived internal political and propaganda advantages.  Or perhaps, as one U.S. official remarked following a seemingly pointless KORCOM outrage, \\"That's just what they do.\\"    I recommend this book to anyone interested in Cold War, Korean peninsula and Northeast Asian military and political history.  The author isa former U.S. Navy officer who served in Korea and Northeast Asia a number of years after the incidents described in this book.  His primary sources, documented in footnotes and a bibliography, are from declassified DOD and State Department records, Congressional hearing records and oral histories of senior civilian and military officials.  The maps are inadequate in either detail or content to follow the progress of deployments or identify the location of some events.  Several black and white photographs add little information since they are of well know people (e.g., President Johnson and Defense Secretary McNamara) or widely published stock photos of military aircraft and vessels.	2004-03-21

Something - the apparent resurgence of Hush Puppy shoes among \\"hip\\" people, is one example the author provides - seems to come out of nowhere and can't be explained by conventional cause and effect.  That is, the Hush Puppy company was not promoting the product but youthful, New York  City \\"trend setters\\" found them in thrift shops, their friends and \\"followers\\" started wearing them and demand skyrocketed in an exponential fashion.  The natural phenomena that best explain this are epidemics; they start small with a few victims and then can spread rapidly to millions of people.<br />Gladwell's basic premise is a useful construct for understanding some social-economic phenomena.  And any student of history knows that relatively few people can make enormous changes, with Christ and his original 12 disciples being the most dramatic instance.  But Gladwell takes much too much space to drag out the same basic point.  One chapter of nauseating detail about the evolution of the children's television program Sesame Street is the most pointlessly drawn out part of the book.  Also Gladwell relies solely on anecdotal evidence with little statistical support and no original research.<br />If you can find a magazine article on this topic - and it sounds like some of the chapters are reworked articles - you may learn all you need.  The writing is well done; there are no charts or graphs to illustrate the principles.  I'd give it two-and-a-half stars if that was possible.	2004-03-21
US	52492795	R2EHWY3W41PWPT	0684811642	9851575	The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order	Books	5	134	168	N	N	The West IS declining.  Deal with it.	Huntington articulates how the economic and demographic decline of Western Civilization relative to several of the world's other major civilizations, especially the Sinic (Chinese) and Islamic, is remaking the so-called world order.  Cold War alliances were a passing phenomenon in which inter-civilization alliances temporarily formed to repel a common ideological foe, and U.S. attempts to maintain those alliances against other American foes, e.g., Islamic fundamentalism, are doomed to failure.  Western countries, including the U.S., need to accept and deal with the relative independence of formerly subservient nations.<br />The truly amazing thing about Huntington's thesis and examples is that he published it eight years ago, based on data and events through 1995.  He almost perfectly profiles (if PC types will forgive me the term) the backgrounds of the 9-11 terrorists and their cohorts.  And he describes how East Asian states will turn away from the U.S. and toward China as the Chinese recover their three thousand year old traditional hegemony over the region.  He also predicts that Russia, the core state of Orthodox civilization, will, after flirting with Westernization, return to attempting to establish its own traditional hegemony over Orthodox allies and neighboring states.<br />Huntington points out that it was European population explosion, as well as technological superiority, that propelled Western Civilization to colonize other continents (North America and Australia) and dominate virtually all other civilizations.  Now the tide has turned as relative population growth drives non-Western immigrants to Europe, North America and Australia.  The spread of Western, especially U.S. commercialism, should not be equated, as many American elites naively assume, with acceptance of liberal Western political and social norms.  Huntington points out that just the opposite is occurring.  As non-Western civilizations prosper from adoption of Western technology they create wealth and independence that allows them to celebrate and assert THEIR traditional values.<br />A particularly interesting point Huntington makes is how U.S. and Western obsession with containing other civilizations' nuclear weapons is failing.  Countries seeking such weapons do so not with the intent of necessarily using them on neighbors but having them to prevent military domination by the U.S.  Huntington reminds us that during the Cold War the U.S-lead West insisted it needed to maintain tactical nuclear weapons to offset the perceived conventional force superiority of the USSR-lead Warsaw Pact nations.  Now that the U.S. has demonstrated dominant conventional military power that nobody else can hope to match, everyone thinks they need nuclear weapons or nuclear-armed allies to protect their independence.  Huntington points out that South Koreans seems a lot less concerned with North Korean nuclear arms than Americans or Japanese are.<br />Finally, this book makes one think that the so-called War on Terrorism is somewhat misguided.  The tactic is terror but the real conflict is inter-civilizational rivalry.  An interesting schematic on page 245 illustrates Huntington predictions of emerging civilizational alignments.  For example, the West will align more closely with Latin American and African civilizations and to some extent with the Orthodox (Russia).  He postulates that Islam will be in greater conflict with virtually ALL other civilizations with which it has regular contact EXCEPT Sinic (China plus the other East Asian countries excluding Japan).  And it's happening.  The UN structure created by the U.S. and Western Europe at the end of WWII IS  a forum for containing and frustrating U.S. and Western interests.   And let's face the truth.  A senior Canadian politician's recent characterization of his country's embrace of homosexual marriage and legalization of marijuana as \\"wellsprings of national pride\\" provides ample evidence that Western civilization IS in decline.  Start studying Mandarin...<br />The book is illustrated with some useful generalized maps and numerous statistical charts to support Huntington's thesis.  HIGHLY recommended to anyone trying to figure out what's happening in the world and why \\"winning the war on terrorism\\" (whatever that means) will not solve all problems.	2004-03-21

It marked the end of French dominance in Indochina and the French Empire itself; propelled the aggressive USSR/Red Chinese backed Viet Minh into power in North Vietnam, then into conflict with the U.S. and its South Vietnamese ally; on to conflict with Cambodia and its former ally, China; and contributed to generally increased Cold War tensions from Korea to Germany; North Africans who fought for the French in Viet Nam were soon fighting against them back in Algeria. <br />I read the entire book, which is something of a challenge since there is arguably too much information in this 500 page, small type face work.  The days of the pre-battle preparation and the 58-day siege itself are told in great detail and with dozens of similar-sounding small unit abbreviations and difficult-for-most-Americans to remember French and other foreign names.  It's almost overwhelming and one is tempted to skip a lot of it, but the hundreds of details and vignettes give the reader a cumulative impression of the thousands of actual details and vignettes experienced by the combatants (from the French forces' perspective) that actually comprised the unimaginable, for anyone without infantry experience, hellish experience.<br />The approximately 20,000 men in the French Forces' represent a startling diversity of nationalities.  It was, after all, a colonial French force.  The initial garrison had only 13% French Mainland troops, although since a third of the volunteers who jumped in as replacements during the siege were French the total French Mainland representation was about 18%.  The largest number of troops were Foreign Legion (26%, mostly German, Eastern European and Spanish) and Vietnamese Regulars (27%), followed by North Africans (18% of the initial garrison, almost none of the volunteer replacements, mostly Algerian and Moroccan) and the remainder were Vietnamese \\"auxiliaries\\" (upcountry ethnic groups, 10%) and less than 2% sub-Saharan Africans.  The North Africans sustained the highest casualty rate, 68% of their numbers were killed, missing or wounded and the Foreign Legion casualty rate was nearly 60%.  French Mainlanders who were only 18% of the battle force comprised 25% of those killed.  There were about 12,000 total casualties before the 360 mile death march to POW camps and many more deaths.<br />Clearly, the besieged troops fought gallantly and fearsomely - Viet Minh casualties were perhaps four times higher - but the initial French strategy, if you can call  it that, of drawing the Viet Minh to a remote battlefield with little strategic importance seems idiotic and the logistical execution was, at best, mediocre.  French fortifications were pathetically inadequate and only after the battle began did officers request instruction manuals for building fortified trenches!  The initial Viet Minh artillery barrage was so unexpectedly overwhelming, despite surprisingly accurate pre-battle intelligence about Viet Minh capabilities, that the French artillery colonel who bragged Viet Minh guns would never touch French Forces committed suicide shortly after the battle started.<br />A few French idiosyncrasies will astound American veterans.  Within the fortress throughout the battle were two official French Army Mobile Brothels, one with Vietnamese women and the other with Algerians.  Although they couldn't bring in enough engineering materials to properly fortify their positions the French made room on pre-battle supply flights for 45,000 gallons of wine, and then airdropped additional French Army-developed wine concentrate during the battle itself, causing troops to mount aggressive missions into Viet Minh lines to liberate wine concentrate that fell outside the fort!<br />Both sides fought with American equipment.  Most of the French artillery, radios, vehicles, aircraft and even one aircraft carrier that supported the garrison came from the U.S.  The Viet Minh got lots of American artillery and other supplies the Chinese had captured in Korea, where a cease fire occurred less than nine months before the battle started.  During the battle about 10% of the Viet Minh ammunition came from air drops that fell into Viet Minh lines, often from C-119s piloted by American civilians.<br />As the situation deteriorated the French begged the United States to unleash B-29s to carpet bomb the Viet Minh.  More than 60 bombers plus jet escorts staged on Okinawa and in the Philippines (some reportedly repainted in French colors), USAF officers made planning flights over the battlefield, and two U.S. carriers deployed to what 10 years later would be called  Yankee Station in the Tonkin Gulf.  In the end Eisenhower, as well as the British, declined to intervene in support of the French, a fact that contributed to France all but dropping out of NATO.<br />In a section about the French forces' experience in Communist POW camps Fall describes how during the battle Viet Minh political commissars gathered prisoners every morning to tell them details about how badly the battle had gone the prior day for French Forces.  POWs who agreed to sit in a special section and cheer each time a piece of bad news or casualty count regarding the French forces was read got extra food and medicine and did not have to work so hard.  The Communist captors awarded such prisoners who cheered their own side's losses with the title of \\"progressives.\\"  It reminds me a little too mcuh of some self-styled &quot;progressives&quot; in the U.S. in 2004.<br />The grainy black and white photo reproductions are interesting, especially seeing the pictures of some of the warriors - man, some of those French generals had big noses!  Sketch maps throughout the book supposedly illustrate the battlefield and how the lines evolved over time but I found them incomprehensible.<br />Highly recommended for military history and Cold War buffs or military veterans.  Anyone who thinks things aren't going so well in Afghanistan or Iraq needs to read this for a sense of perspective.	2004-01-06

US	52492795	R3U7DV3XD1Z3TZ	0684857804	880656084	ROLLING THUNDER: Jet Combat From WW II to the Gulf War	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A Fascinating View of Air Warfare Development	This book analyzes the evolution of jet air superiority warfare from the German Me-262 of 1944-45 through the mid-1990s.  More than being a mere compilation of aircraft performance statistics, photographs and macho war stories (all of which are somewhat lacking), Rolling Thunder analyzes the major jet air superiority campaigns to date - late-WWII, Korea, Cold War bomber-intercept development, Vietnam, Israel's 1960s-80s conflicts, the Falklands, Desert Storm and post-Desert Storm in the Balkans and the Iraqi \\"no-fly zones\\".<br />I do NOT agree with other reviewers who compare it unfavorably to more narrowly focused books or complain about focus on the U.S. Air Force (there's a lot about German, British, Israeli and non-Western air forces)  And let's face it: the U.S. Navy did not have good enough jets to maintain air superiority in Korea and in Desert Storm the Navy only downed two Iraqi jets compared to 30 for the USAF (and half of THOSE were accounted for by one unit!).  The number of misspellings, typos and date errors is relatively minor and NOT distracting from the overall book quality.<br />Besides well-written complex narratives explaining how tactics and weapons use evolved over time, Rendall emphasizes the importance of human factors in achieving battlefield air superiority.  While it's important to have the highest quality aircraft and weapons, it's still - to date, at least - pilot ability and tactical leadership make the ultimate difference.  This is most strongly illustrated by Israel's ability on many occasions to establish air superiority - with air-to-air kill ratios of 50-to-1 - even with comparable aircraft and Britain eventually beating back Argentine aircraft that outnumbered them by more than 6-to-1.<br />One of Rendall's most thoughtful insights is the fundamental advantage of Western culture's celebration of individual excellence, competition and initiative.  Non-Western air forces, most significantly the Soviet Union, relied heavily on central ground control of large numbers of aircraft and mediocre pilots rather than letting a small number of superior pilots and air warfare leaders act with individual initiative.  Soviet training showed its spectacular weaknesses in the annihilation of its client states' air forces, most notably Egypt, Syria and Iraq.<br />There's a fascinating description of declining Soviet pilot skill levels during the 1970s-80s due to their leftwing obsession with a form of pilot \\"affirmative action\\".  Rendall says that to ensure weaker pilots would not be \\"left behind\\", and thereby reflect badly on the pilot selection/training establishment, the Soviets systematically reduced pilot training standards.  They had many outstanding pilots, but their average pilot skill level steadily declined even as their aircraft performance and weapons quality increased.<br />At the end of the book I understand how Western - especially American/Anglo - air forces came to dominate their actual and potential adversaries.  However the incredible cost of developing and deploying new aircraft is almost beyond the range of even the United States - an F-80 cost $90,000 in 1946 and today's fighters can cost more than $30,000,000!  And if the United States ever loses a couple of AWACS at the same time during combat the air battle will quickly descend into total confusion.  Finally, Western air forces and other superior military capabilities have driven our adversaries to employ suicide bombers and other asymmetrical tactics not easily countered by conventional forces (Saddam Hussein is probably the only person in the world dumb enough to take on the U.S. armed forces (twice!))<br />I REALLY enjoyed this book and recommend in the highest possible terms to anyone interested in modern warfare, late-20th Century international conflicts and the history of technological development.  Rolling Thunder's weakest point is its unfortunate title, which was the name of an air campaign that, despite pilot skill and gallantry, was notably ineffective while losing and resulted great aircraft and aircrew losses due to strategic, political and leadership flaws at the highest levels of the U.S. military and civilian government.	2003-07-25

When the smoke cleared 134 sailors were killed - often in the most agonizing manner imaginable - and more than 100 more were seriously burned or otherwise injured. The explanation of the how the fire started (technically from equipment failure, but the failure would never have occurred if plane handling crews had not deviated from safety regulations) and got out of control (obsolete ordnance exploded on the flight deck in less than one-and-a-half minutes, before the initial fire could be contained). To me that is the best part of the book.    The tales of the fire from the perspective of several young \\"citizen sailors\\" and the carriers experienced CO and wizened Engineering/Damage Control officer offer a heart wrenching view of the conditions faced by those fighting the inferno. Although some of the sailors exhibit \\"attitude problems\\" (as did I as a citizen sailor in the same era) they fight bravely with inadequate equipment and (according to the author) little fire line leadership (Freeman says lots of the equipment and the best trained firefighters were lost in the explosions at the beginning of the fire). The courage, tenacity and eventual success of the citizen sailors in saving the ship belies the snide, condescending remarks Defense Secretary Rumsfeld recently made comparing the U.S.'s current military to supposedly inferior draft-era servicemen (the sailors, while not draftees per se were also not, by 2003 standards, \\"professionals\\"). The book would have been stronger if Freeman had tracked down some junior officers and senior petty officers who fought the fire, since there's virtually no account from anyone between E-4 and full Commander.    Overall I enjoyed the book and, sad though the story is, recommend it to anyone interested in aircraft carriers in general and the Vietnam-era Navy in particular. If you are knowledgeable about the Navy and carriers, be warned there are lots of errors (e.g., Forrestal was certainly NOT the most powerful carrier at the time, that honor clearly goes to Enterprise) and repeated wording errors really grate on a sailor's ears (e.g., ships don't have \\"mess halls\\" as Freeman repeats over and over, they have \\"mess decks\\"; also a quote from the CO addressing the crew as \\"comrades\\" (?!) rather than \\"shipmates\\" is improbable). A review of this book in the August 2003 Naval History magazine REALLY pans it and calls it \\"historical fiction\\", but I wouldn't go that far. There is a documentary on the Forrestal fire, Situation Critical - The U.S.S. Forrestal, also sold on Amazon.com.	2003-07-13

The experiences of early jet-to-jet combat as well as close air support and strategic bombing are told in chronological order and illustrated with dozens of B&W as well as color photographs, including many two page spreads.<br />Some of battle recaps are amazing.  Many times 20, 40, 60 or more North Korean/Chinese/Soviet Mig-15s came up to battle F-86s and other \\"UN\\" fighters in extended battles over hundreds of square miles.  B-29s were attacked by Migs despite jet escorts and there was lots of danger, day and night, from AAA and other ground fire.  The USAF was never able to take air supremacy for granted.<br />There are appendixes listing all the \\"aces\\" (the only US Navy ace flew a WWII left over F4U Corsair to shoot down North Korean biplanes!), other notable pilots (future astronauts, etc.) and order of battle listing all USAF, US Navy and British Commonwealth units and the planes they flew.  The emphasis is fully on the \\"UN\\" side of the war (mostly USAF, but some sections on US Navy and land and carrier based British and Australian units), with virtually no photographs (except gun camera shots) of Communist aircraft and very little about their pilots.<br />Highly recommended to Korean War and aerial combat buffs, veterans and military historians.	2003-06-30

The hypothetical reconstruction of the catastrophic torpedo explosion that first killed the men in the torpedo room and then, following a far more powerful secondary explosion of other torpedoes that blew off the SSGN's entire giant bow section (Kursk was three times larger than a Los Angeles Class SSN!), about 85% of the entire crew is the most interesting part of the book.  Only 28 men in the nuclear reactor spaces, who gathered below the escape hatch in the ninth - farthest aft - compartment to await rescuers, survived the initial catastrophe.  After Kursk sinks the story bounces somewhat confusingly back and forth among the survivors, the Russian surface fleet and rescue vessels, families and officials at the decrepit, depressing Kola Peninsula Russian Navy Bases (where reportedly more than a dozen submariners commit suicide each year) and the Norwegian-British military and oil industry rescuers.<br />The saga illustrates how pathetic the Russian Navy is (the Northern Fleet is supposed to be a world-class military force but actually is barely a local coast guard, despite massive nuclear weapons), and how their culture of blame avoidance contributed to incredible delays in, first, even noticing Kursk was lost and then talking a long time to find the sub's resting place just 350' below the surface.  While the Navy provides misleading and knowingly inaccurate information - even to would-be rescuers - they can hardly get their rescue vessels into the water and then prove unable to dock with Kursk's escape hatch.<br />In contrast, a British Navy submarine rescue officer takes initiative to begin assembling rescue crews and equipment before his own navy, much less the Russians, ask for assistance.  The oil field divers and their support vessels likewise drop their lucrative work on the Norwegian coast and deploy quickly to the accident scene, only to be pointlessly held at a distance by inept Russian naval officers for several precious hours before being permitted to dive on Kursk.  Although the commercial divers quickly get in position to prepare Kursk to receive the Royal Navy's rescue vessel they determine the aft compartment where the survivors held out has already been slowly flooded due to \\"lack of structural integrity\\" where the drive shaft pierces compartment nine.  If the Norwegians and British had been allowed on the scene earlier the outcome MIGHT have been different.<br />I rate this book good, but not great.  It will appeal mostly to submarine buffs and those seeking insights into the remnants of dysfunctional Soviet (Czarist?) cultural norms that will keep Russia backward for the foreseeable future.  There don't seem to be any blockbuster revelations that haven't been reported elsewhere, and the prose is not exceptional.  There are 252 pages plus crew roster, index, two small scale maps, a small scale schematic diagram or Kursk and 23 b&w photos.	2003-06-27

Co-written by &#8220;plankowner&#8221; crewmember, Lee Vyborny, and a professional journalist, Dark Waters tells the inside story of the delayed, far-over-budget initial construction, the crew&#8217;s selection and torment by the infamous Admiral Rickover and the difficulties of putting a totally unique vessel into operational service.  NR-1, which is still in service, has a tiny 130 horsepower nuclear power plant, displaces a mere 409 tons (compared to 6,900 tons for the Navy&#8217;s Los Angeles Class SSNs), and operates with a crew of 12 or fewer.  Its most unique aspect is an ability to operate and maneuver indefinitely at depths up to 3,000&#8217; and search out and recover lost objects (e.g., a top secret missile from a sunken aircraft) or pry open our adversaries' military secrets (e.g., a Soviet underwater detection system in the Mediterranean).<br />During the ten year operational period Vyborny writes about, NR-1 suffered many &#8220;near-death&#8221; experiences due to equipment failures and the inherent hazards of operating a tiny submarine &#8220;on the edge&#8221; for extended periods.  Several tales of the crew&#8217;s ability to get themselves out of tight jams (there was no way anyone on the surface could help them) are riveting, inspiring examples of men living up to the highest traditions of Naval service.  These sailors&#8217; little known &#8220;inner space&#8221; explorations are as intriguing and inspiring as many of NASA&#8217;s outer space exploits of the same era.<br />Unfortunately NR-1&#8217;s post-1970s operations are barely mentioned in Dark Waters.  Likewise, reference is made to increased Navy-civilian NR-1 science operations, but few concrete examples are provided.  Unfortunately the book contains some factual errors.  For example, Vyborny asserts NR-1 &#8220;has become the oldest operational boat in the Navy.&#8221;  Even assuming, which is not clear from the context, that by &#8220;boat&#8221; Vyborny means submarine, that is not a correct statement.  USS Dolphin (AGSS 555) went into commission in 1968, several months before NR-1 was launched; despite a fire and near-sinking last year, the Navy so far has kept Dolphin in commission (DBF!).<br />As a former Navy Spook I sometimes cringe when books like Dark Waters, Blind Man&#8217;s Bluff, etc. disclosure formerly classified Cold War capabilities and operations.  At the same time I&#8217;m proud of the heroic and inspired efforts, as well as willingness to endure danger and discomfort, that lead to our Cold War victory, and believe these stories need to be told.  I recommend Dark Waters to anyone interested in submarine technology, deepwater exploration, nautical adventure and Cold War history.	2003-03-20
US	52492795	R38LJBELFX9014	0312233965	641321782	Why Angels Fall: A Journey Through Orthodox Europe from Byzantium to Kosovo	Books	4	27	35	N	N	Don't Dismiss This Book Too Quickly	As a Christian who is not Orthodox, but studies and is sympathetic to Orthodox beliefs and practices, I struggled with this book.  It's frustrating when non-believers critique Christian topics because their very non-belief renders them unable to understand Christian life and culture.  But since believers often can't or won't provide useful critiques of faults in Christian organizations and practices, who else but non-believers like Victoria Clark will do the job?<br />Yes, Clark drags up embarrassing or even repulsive incidents in Orthodox history and paints an unflattering portrait of many of the priests, monks and nuns she encounters on her 18-month \\"pilgrimage\\" through several Orthodox countries.  But by the end of the book Clark seems more sympathetic to the plight of a 2,000 year old body of believers who have suffered centuries of Islamic and, to a lesser extent, Western European dominance and persecution.  Clark positively describes the growing vitality and energy associated with monastic communities in countries she visits.  And she describes, although a little grudgingly, warm encounters with Orthodox clergy and lay people.<br />A theme Clark explores which also troubles me is the tendency of contemporary Orthodox churches to emphasize nationalistic and even militaristic, as opposed to Christian, agendas.  The seeming lack of Orthodox interest in missionary endeavors and converts is also disappointing, but seems consistent with the xenophobia Clark exposes among some Orthodox.  It seems many Orthodox are more interested in maintaining their separateness, keeping their wounds unhealed and playing the martyr than building on and attracting converts to their community.  If Orthodoxy offers the prospect of a superior lifestyle and superior way to worship and know God, which I believe it may, then why don't Orthodox more enthusiastically display this side of their faith to \\"outsiders\\" - or in some cases even their own nominal adherents?  Then perhaps Orthodox, particularly in Russia, could stop whining about Catholics and Protestants \\"stealing\\" from their flock.  The Apostles certainly were not afraid to competitively demonstrate the superiority of their faith in the religious hodgepodge of the Roman Empire.<br />Clark's non-belief is humorous is some ways.  Several times she marvels how some \\"coincidence\\" allows her to meet just the right person or make just the right connection to propel her research to a new insight.  A Christian wouldn't be so surprised by such \\"coincidences\\".  Near the end, reflecting on some of the admirable Orthodox she encountered, Clark writes, \\"They made me wish I could believe as they did.\\"  Poor Victoria Clark... another soul unable to move beyond her dead end belief in postmodern, secular humanism.<br />I do not recommend this book as your only source for information about Orthodox history and current affairs, much less theology and beliefs.  But Orthodox and would-be-Orthodox should read it and ponder Clark's points as should anyone wanting to better understand the political situation in Orthodox nations.	2003-03-15

One page briefly describes the person and something about their life and philosophy; the second provides a supposedly complete list of the small number of items each person lived with or took on a trip.  It's thought provoking as to how much - or how little - stuff we really need to live a good life.  At the same time it's a VERY brief book that can be read in about 30 minutes.  Because there is a bibliography listing one or more sources for or about each person this book might best be considered an introduction/reference for those wanting to study the philosophy of simplicity.  It's also a good inspirational gift for someone who wants to simplify their life.  Too bad publishers don't provide little books like this for a more reasonable price.	2003-03-03

The cover blurb of this short book by an American Benedictine monk promises Celtic Spirituality \\"introduces a mysterious and extraordinary spiritual world (that) developed among the Celtic peoples sixteen centuries ago.\\"  Fr. Timothy's book tells something of pre-Christian and early-Christian Celtic social structure, customs and worldview and provides a few examples of Celtic prayers.  But this book is primarily the HISTORY (i.e., names, dates, administrative structure) of Christian institutions in Celtic lands and not an exploration of Celtic Christian beliefs and practice or, more specifically, how those beliefs and practices shaped the Celtic people before they came under Norman and English domination.<br />Fr. Timothy emphasizes that Ireland was the only early-Christian culture in Western Europe never controlled by the Roman Empire.  The Celtic Church, while strictly Trinitarian in belief, celebrated God's gifts of nature and humanity in a relatively non-legalistic manner.  Then he recounts the history of the Roman church eventually dominating the native Irish, until the 1840s Potato Famine horror destroyed both the economy and any remaining traditional Celtic social structure and laid mid-Nineteenth Century legalistic, conservative, hierarchical Roman Catholicism over impoverished, dysfunctional Irish families.  Fr. Timothy asserts the result, today's image of \\"Irish Catholic\\", is a foreign, inauthentic Irish Christianity far removed from its Celtic roots.<br />All of that may be true and interesting, but I finished the book still not knowing exactly what Celtic Christianity is and how, other than making pilgrimages to contemporary retreat centers scattered through Ireland and Britain, one might pursue modern day Celtic spirituality.<br />Although Ireland's lack of Roman domination is mentioned several times and Fr. Timothy mentions Eastern Orthodox Christianity in passing a couple of times, his Roman Catholic-centered world view never lets him, if you'll allowme a newly popular but already overused phrase, connect the dots.  Since St. Patrick and his peers brought Christianity to the Celts at a time, around 400 AD, when all Christians were still \\"Orthodox\\" and other books demonstrate direct connections between the Celtic Church and the Eastern Christian monasteries of the Desert Fathers, it seems logical to conclude that Celtic Christianity was the local version of what still lives on as Eastern Orthodoxy.<br />There is a fairly long bibliography (virtually all for books published in the 1990s) and a list of organizations sponsoring Celtic retreats, revival, etc. (although not a single Internet address is provided).  A few black and white photo reproductions are unremarkable.<br />I enjoyed reading Celtic Spirituality, and recommend it as a short history of Christian Church administration in Celtic cultures but feel one needs to look elsewhere to learn more about Celtic (Orthodox) Christianity itself.	2003-03-01

The Left just can't just come out and admit that the world, especially formerly enslaved Eastern Europe, is better (not perfect but better) subsequent to the USSR's demise.<br />Hollywood pumps out film after film about the alleged evils of United States domestic and international shortcomings (of which there are many) and one-sided sympathetic portrayals of left wing heroes, but Charen says \\"Quick: try to think of a single movie about the horrors of Stalinism.  This is not a failure of imagination.  This is moral meltdown.\\"<br />Charen provides a memorable metaphor for American liberals' inability to realistically perceive the relative successes and moral positions of the United States and its Cold War adversaries.  She points out that liberals turn the Lords' New Testament words inside out to the effect that liberals couldn't see past the speck of sawdust in the United States' eye in order to see the plank in the Soviets' eye.<br />Useful Idiots is well written and makes its points, but for many readers Charen will be preaching to the converted.  I recommend challenging your left-oriented friends to read and discuss this book with you.	2003-02-19
US	52492795	R2JYAJAO6W3TOM	055338029X	243328997	Flags of Our Fathers	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Has a message for the Appease Saddam Now crowd	Flags of Our Fathers tells the story - before, during and after WWII - of modest men singled out by fate to become immortalized in 1/400th of a second by a chance photograph capturing what was - to the participants - an insignificant moment.  The Photograph, which - incredibly, given 1945 technology - was published in Sunday newspapers all over the United States just two days after the actual event - galvanized the nation and evolved into a symbolic emblem not only of the Marines but of all Americans who rose to the demands of the occasion to roll back totalitarian forces in the Pacific and Europe.<br />Some reviewers correctly point out that Flags of Our Fathers is rife with factual errors and questionable interpretations, undeserved criticism and apparent ignorance of Navy and Army contributions to victory.  Therefore, anyone seeking a comprehensive history of the Battle of Iwo Jima, much less the entire Pacific campaign, needs to look elsewhere.<br />But every American who wants to understand WWII should read Flags of Our Fathers to learn that men are able to endure and persevere under conditions of unimaginable pain and horror for a righteous, or even not-so-righteous cause.  And then, although many are killed or horribly maimed, some will come back and, despite the horror that never completely leaves their minds, lead lives that fulfill the old cliché, \\"Living well is the best revenge.\\"<br />And another group of Americans who may not be interested in WWII should also read this book.  One anecdote retells a 1975 Thanksgiving dinner episode between author James Bradley and his Iwo Jima-veteran father, Jack.  Younger Bradley, fresh back from living and studying in Japan, lectures his father with the discredited apologist myth that \\"American insensitivity to Japanese culture and FDR's severing of their oil supplies forced Japan... to attack Pearl Harbor. ... Japan was the victim.\\"  Younger Bradley, who no longer shares that naïve, revisionist view of WWII, expected his father to argue with him.  But the then-52 year old veteran who \\"knew a hell of a lot more about why we got (into the war) than I did... just nodded\\", and passed his then-ungrateful son another slice of turkey.<br />Recently a young know-it-all representative of the Appeasement At All Costs movement in the United States recited the same tired, apologetic-for-totalitarianism argument regarding Iraq that James Bradley lectured his father with.  They and everyone else who really wants to understand the difference between America and totalitarian regimes, whether 60 years ago or today, should also read this book.	2003-02-02
US	52492795	RSQL8I7CDQZ8	0345426355	302173523	Monitor: The Story of the Legendary Civil War Ironclad and The Man Whose Invention Changed the Course of History	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Most famous ship in US Navy history?	This slim volume recounts the history of USS Monitor which, in its famous engagement with the CSS Virginia (Merrimac) on March 9, 1862, rendered all wooden warships obsolete and initiated a naval arms race among world's navies that climaxed 80 years later in the Pacific battles of World War II.<br />Monitor's creator was a Swedish engineering prodigy named John Ericsson who had supervised 400 men as a canal engineer by age 16.  For an 1829 railroad design competition built a steam locomotive that established a land speed record by covering a measured mile in 57 seconds (63 mph).  But the contest sponsors changed the rules to defeat foreigner Ericsson and his attempts to provide innovate designs to the Royal Navy were also rejected.  In frustration Ericsson emigrated to the United States and in 1837 invented the first practical screw propeller to drive steamships through the water.<br />In 1861 Union intelligence indicated the Confederates were rebuilding the scuttled former Union warship USS Merrimac as a heavily armed ironclad.  If that ship (rechristened CSS Virginia but generally called simply \\"Merrimac\\"), broke the blockade of Hampton Roads then US coastal cities, including Washington, DC, would be vulnerable to attack.  The Union needed an ironclad quickly, and Ericsson already had a plan!<br />Monitor's keel was laid in Brooklyn, NY on October 25, 1861, and Ericsson and his numerous subcontractors worked 108 days and nights until on February 9, 1862 USS Monitor was turned over to the Navy.  Exactly one month later Monitor faced Merrimac at Hampton Roads.  Objectively the battle was a tactical draw, but strategic victory went to the Union.  The Union blockade was preserved, the Confederates remained bottled up and Britain and France, who were leaning toward supporting the South, decided to remain officially neutral.<br />This book tells the story of the design, construction, combat history, demise and legacy of USS Monitor in a well-written narrative format.  It provides enough details for general readers interested in naval, engineering and civil war history.  It may be too general for the serious buff, but I recommend it as an amazing tale to everyone else who wants to know more about this important historical event.<br />There are some small reproductions of period etchings and photos and a good map of the Hampton Roads battle area.  The only thing missing are good schematics of Monitor's interior design.	2003-01-19

Its not a pretty story, and its not a story familiar to many Americans.<br />The gist of the problem for the British was that Britain had an insatiable demand for tea and silk, but there was virtually nothing the Chinese wanted to import from Britain.  Therefore British traders in Canton imported opium from British-owned plantations in India, creating millions of Chinese opium addicts (including the emperor himself).  Not only did drug dealing more than offset their negative balance of payments, it eventually generated nearly 10% of British tax collections.<br />The first Opium War erupted in 1839 when the Chinese officials got serious about suppressing the opium trade and resulted, among other things, in the British navy and numerically small but well-armed ground troops opening various Chinese ports by force and obtaining possession of Hong Kong.  The second Opium War, in which French navy and army forces joined, resulted in the conquest of Peking and the destruction of immense artistic and cultural wealth when the Summer Palace complex was looted and burned.  In fact the words loot apparently came into the English language in the first Opium War from a Hindi word lut.  Queen Victoria even named a Pekinese dog sent to her from the sack of Peking Lootie.<br />Nobody comes off well.  The British are uniformly horrible, and the French only slightly better.  Americans are not active belligerents (excepting one occasion when a US Navy captain intervenes, despite contrary orders, to help the British), but American traders and consuls are involved in drug dealing.  And, yes, the Chinese are victimized, but many Chinese grew wealthy as opium importers (the authors describe one Chinese as the worlds wealthiest man), most officials were corrupt, incompetent and uncaring regarding their citizens welfare, and Chinese soldiers serving in the British army commit as many atrocities as the Brits and Sikhs.<br />While the British ignore this sorry episode and Americans are largely ignorant of it, the Chinese remember Western aggression and their victimization all too well.  Opium plagued China for another century, although most was home-grown by 1900.  On the eve of World War II 10% of the population was addicted, with 30% of Hong Kongs population addicted (Not the image of efficient British colonial administration, is it?).  Massive opium addiction did not end in China until the Communists brutally cracked down on it after their 1949 victory.  The authors conclude, The Great Helmsman just said no.<br />I recommend this book as an excellent overview of 19th Century Western interaction with China and an important piece of knowledge for those who would understand Chinese wariness towards the West since 1949.  The few reproductions of  paintings and photographs are interesting, but the large scale map of China is inadequate to follow the complex series of military actions.  There is a bibliography for those who want to study the subject further, although many of those books will be hard to come by outside a major university library.	2003-01-16

There is a brief chapter, in chronological order, for each sub giving a summary of its war history, a description of how it was lost and two and a few photographs of the sub and perhaps some of its crew and related ships (e.g., Japanese ships it sank).  Appendices include a summary of all the losses in two pages and a summary by submarine of the losses each one inflicted on the Japanese.  One important missing element in the submarine loss charts is an analysis of the cause of loss; a significant number were actually lost to sea conditions (e.g., running aground), systems failures or friendly fire, as opposed to combat.  While the precise cause of loss, if known, is included in each sub's story, it would be enlightening to also have a summary in the appendix.  Also a chart mapping the loss locations would provide another useful perspective.  Recommended as a reference for looking up the &quot;quick story&quot; of each of these gallant crews and boats.	2003-01-05

Chenoweth (a combat artist in Korea and Vietnam) has created a phenomenal large-format collection of 200 years of American combat art.  More than a so-called coffee table book, Col. Chenoweth tells the fascinating backgrounds and field experiences of the combat artists and the battles they both participated in and interpreted with their talent.  After a century of relying on battlefield photographic realism, it is amazing to see how \\"less accurate\\" drawings and paintings provide an emotional realism almost never captured in photographs.  It's also refreshing to see so much coverage devoted to post-WWII conflicts and the extremely high quality art representing Korea, Vietnam, 1980s Lebanon, the Gulf War and Somalia.  Military history students and buffs will want to refer to this book for a unique perspective on the conflicts they study.  This work is particularly heavy with the work or Navy and Marine Corps artists.  Well reproduced art, well written and HIGHLY recommended!  Bravo Zulu and Semper Fi, Col. Chenoweth.	2003-01-05

Dr. Wicks' series of brief, mostly single-paragraph, thought-provoking vignettes centers on four themes: Experiencing the Lord, Availability, Clarity and Ordinariness.

The most unique and haunting images are underwater photographs of sea growth-encrusted submarines taken on research and archeological expeditions around the world.  There is a small bibliography, list of relevant websites and source for each reproduced painting or photo.<br />I recommend this book.  While not providing full details on any of these famous incidents (virtually all the submarines are the topic of at least one full book and numerous articles) this book is a good overview for anyone interested in naval and submarine history.  It makes a photographic/painting supplement for the more demanding submarine researcher or buff.	2002-12-13

It focuses on how the most senior government officials (President, VP, Powell, Rumsfeld, Rice, Tenent, etc.) worked as a team during the last three months of 2001 to prioritize, formulate and conduct the successful military campaign to disrupt Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda stronghold. Controversial U.S. domestic responses (indefinite detention of suspects, the unsolved anthrax attacks, airline security efforts, etc.) are barely mentioned. <br />Even though the events covered in Bush at War occurred barely one year ago, we lose track of perspective in our \\"news\\"-saturated culture. It's amazing to recall how much happened, and has already been mostly forgotten, in such a short time.<br />The most informative part of the book is the process by which senior government officials cooperatively (more so the initial months than, according to media reports, subsequently) addressed an unanticipated event. The most surprising part is how truly unanticipated the attack was and how unprepared for response the U.S. military was. Former Clinton administration officials, from Clinton himself on down, assert they were actively engaged in pursuit of bin Laden/al Qaeda subsequent to the Nairobi and USS Cole attacks. Yet as of 9-11 the Central Command apparently had ABSOLUTELY NO contingency plans for attacking al Qaeda strongholds in Afghanistan other than more wimpy Clintonesque Tomahawk missile strikes on empty training camps (which President Bush wisely refused to do). Some American forces were ready to go against al Qaeda strongholds in just a few days but the vaunted defense planners had no contingency arrangements for temporary air bases in the region; this turned out to be the primary delay in mounting a military response. Also surprising, in light of more recent events, is the President's initial insistence, despite pressure from certain officials, on not getting sidetracked by Iraq (so much so that he cancelled a previously approved strike against Iraqi missile sites that had fired on U.S. aircraft in order to avoid the impression Iraq was being attacked in response to 9-11).<br />Bush at War is based on extensive interviews with the principals and access to contemporaneous notes of then-secret meetings. Famed Washington Post investigative reporter Woodward is not known for being soft on government officials. Therefore, the highly positive picture of the President's and senior officials' performance in the initial weeks of the United States' escalated conflict with militant Islam is reassuring. Despite some media portrayals, President Bush comes across as a very competent leader.<br />I recommend this book as a starting point for more detailed reading on what has, and has not, been accomplished in the non-Islamic world's response to the militant Islamic forces that seek to destroy or contain non-Islamic institutions through out the world.	2002-12-07

Tales of pre-War submarine training and Navy life and liberty in the Philippines and China set the backdrop for the story.  Unlike some WWII submarine books this one includes lots of perspective from the sailors, and their wives and sweethearts, as well as the ship's officers.<br />In December 1941, S-39 and several other *pigboats* (a term for the already obsolete S boats used by sailors on the then-modern *fleet boats* which, themselves, came to be called pigboats by the nuclear-powered submarine generation) made the first war patrols.  When it became clear the Japanese would conquer the Philippines S-39 withdrew, shooting, from the ruined Cavite Navy base near Manila: foraging for supplies among island villages, sinking two Japanese ships, suffering depth charge and bomb attacks, refitting in soon-to-be-conquered Dutch-dominated Indonesia and finally limping into Fremantle, Australia on one engine.  By March 1942, S-39 had three war patrols under her belt.<br />A few months later, after extensive repairs and operating from Brisbane with a new skipper, S-39 makes a short breakdown plagued patrol and then, on her fifth patrol in August 1942, runs hopelessly aground off a remote island near New Guinea.  Unable to re-float the stranded sub, S-39's crew scuttles the vessel and swims through dangerous stormy waves to a nearby reef to await rescue from an Australian destroyer.  After some of the crew spends the night standing on a reef in water that rises above their waist during high tide, everyone makes it safely back to Australia.   In an afterword we learn, sadly, that both of S-39's skippers and several other crew members we've come to know through this book perish in other submarines lost during the War.<br />There are useful sketch maps of each patrol.The best feature of the book may be the 57 black and white photos.  Most of them are of the men whose words and actions are portrayed in the book.  I found myself referring to them often as the story unfolded. <br />I recommend this book highly to everyone interested in naval and submarine history.  It's a chance to look beyond the *big picture* of strategies and admirals to recall the importance of the day-to-day struggle to persevere and succeed even when circumstances or equipment are not ideal.  Even though S-39 was not the ideal vessel to aggressively pursue the Imperial Japanese Navy in early 1942, her officers and crew lived by a code articulated, many years later, by none other than Miss Piggy: *You gotta go with whatcha got.*	2002-12-02

Mr. Burrows has written a detailed account of United States Air Force, Navy and CIA airborne electronic and photographic reconnaissance efforts from the end of WWII through the US Navy's P3 incident on Hainan in 2001. The development of specialized aircraft (U-2, SR-71), electronics and camera equipment as well as modification of ordinary aircraft (B-29, B-47, C-130, etc) for reconnaissance missions is covered in sufficient detail to satisfy everyone expect hardcore technical buffs.<br />Besides detailed descriptions of 16 Cold War shootdowns that involved US deaths - many of which did not become widely known until recently - Mr. Burrows presents evidence to support the premise that many crewmen initially survived shootdowns only to be murdered or die in Soviet prisons. There are also many tales of crews that returned with damaged aircraft, and sometimes wounded men, to their home base or after a period of Soviet incarceration. The efforts of families of lost crewmen to find out what happened to their relatives, despite stonewalling by both the US and foreign governments, add a deeply human touch to what would otherwise be a recitation of interesting facts and scary war stories.<br />There are lots of footnotes supporting the events described and a number of photographs of lost aircrews and some of the aircraft they flew.	2002-09-25
US	52492795	R2L0ISDG36VDHA	0471415340	458416481	October Fury	Books	4	30	31	N	N	Eyeball to Eyeball with Nuclear Torpedoes	Just in time for the 40th anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis, Peter Huchthausen provides an \\"I was there\\" account of the Crisis from alternating perspectives of U.S. Navy destroyer crews attempting to enforce a blockade of Cuba and Soviet submarine crews that unknowingly stumble into the largest antisubmarine warfare force ever assembled during the Cold War. In 1962 Huchthausen was a junior officer on the American destroyer USS Blanding which hunted the Soviet submarines and inspected Soviet freighters withdrawing from Cuba with ballistic missiles.<br />Other sources provide better overviews of the strategic and political aspects of the Cuban Missile Crisis, but the unique aspect of October Fury is the story, based on Huchthausen's interviews with former Soviet submarine officers, of what happens to four Foxtrot Class submarines when the USSR attempts to move them from their base near the Artic Circle to the port of Mariel in Cuba. The Foxtrot crews, unaware of the larger ongoing Soviet deployment of land-based ballistic and surface-to-air missiles, bombers and other forces to Cuba that will soon trigger the Crisis, depart the Kola Peninsula in early September 1962, with orders to make their way to Cuba while avoiding detection by American forces at all costs. As the submarines near the Bahamas in mid-October the U.S.-Soviet face off over Cuban-based nuclear weapons has commenced and the Foxtrots receive orders to cancel their voyage to Cuba and deploy instead to combat patrol stations in the Atlantic and Caribbean . The rest of the book details action over several days as the Soviet submarines vainly try to remain undetected while American destroyers and aircraft hound them mercilessly, trying to force them to surface and withdraw. There are several tense encounters between the Soviet submarines and their American tormenters that nearly result in actual combat.<br />Huchthausen's writing would benefit from more editing to eliminate wordiness and repetitions (we're told three times that a pre-Crisis American military exercise was called \\"Ortsac, which is Castro spelled backward\\") and some of the dialog wording sounds improbable. The one small-scale chart showing the area of ocean and islands where the destroyer-submarine confrontations take place is grossly inadequate to help readers follow vessel movements as each side jockeys for advantage. And the former destroyer officer should have asked a submariner to edit the descriptions of submarine operations to correct some terms and details.<br />Despite these shortcomings, I greatly enjoyed October Fury and recommend it to everyone interested in the Cuban Missile Crisis, Cold War military topics, submarine adventure and signals intelligence (SIGINT). Huchthausen's depiction of the Soviets' ambitious intended military deployment in Cuba and the operations of the Soviet Navy and its submarine crews will fascinate Cold War buffs. Readers won't want to put down the dramatic, detailed, back and forth descriptions from submarine and destroyer crew perspectives as the Crisis builds up and fades away. This story has the potential to make a great movie. A Foxtrot submarine like those in this book is currently on display to the public in Seattle...	2002-09-20

Bamford's descriptions of the mechanics of SIGINT operations and quotations from interviews with former military SIGINT operators ring true. Bamford starts with a coherent description of how NSA (National Security Agency) grew out of the communications intercept and cryptologic successes of WWII. Then he has sections that provide detailed accounts of major Cold War incidents that have already been widely written about (Ivy Bells, the Pueblo, the Liberty, Maddox) along with accounts of some activities that have not been so widely written about from a SIGINT perspective (Suez incident, Africa, Cuba) and a provocative, thought provoking perspective on the successes and failures of SIGINT in Vietnam. Finally he devotes, in my opinion, far too much space to chapters describing the details of NSA buildings, computers and bureaucratic infighting that will only interest hardcore SIGINT geeks or foreign intelligence operatives.<br />Many incidents Bamford writes about are, by definition, controversial and there are other seemingly well-researched accounts that provide different perspectives than found in this book. I recommend you consult those other sources as well if you wish to get a more complete picture of specific incidents. I give this book a three star rating because the writing is not that good and it covers such a broad range of material that few readers will be interested in everything he writes about. Finally, many of Bamford's assertions are based on still-classified documents that Bamford says were somehow made available to him for this book. Who knows?	2002-09-19
US	52492795	R5ZUKOGCRX9E6	0385500912	463676104	The Mountain of Silence: A Search for Orthodox Spirituality	Books	5	11	13	N	N	Things Lots of Christians Don�t Know About Christianity	Kyriacos Markides, a Cyprus-born sociology professor at an American university, is a former skeptic who sought spiritual truths in the South and East Asian religions, but then came to realize the Orthodox Christian faith of his youth is also an \\"Eastern\\" religion with roots in mystical practice.  Markides begins studying Orthodox mystical traditions among monks at Mount Athos in Greece - \\"the Christian Tibet\\" - but most of the book is a recounting of dialogs on Christian spiritual and theological beliefs with a former Mount Athos monk, Father Maximos, who is abbot of a monastery on Cyprus.<br />The theme of the book is that Western Christianity, both Roman Catholic and Protestant, is hopelessly entwined in a philosophical, scientific, rational approach to trying to know God.  By relying on human reason to \\"prove\\" God's existence and rejecting the spiritual knowledge and practices of the early Church \\"fathers and mothers\\" - \\"the holy elders have taught throughout the ages that God speaks to human beings only through the heart\\" - Western Christians have rejected the core of Christianity.  Only a few Christians can be monks and nuns totally devoting themselves to using ancient techniques for spiritual growth to move as close as possible to God as is humanly possible.  But the existence of monastic communities provides a environment to both preserve the ancient knowledge and make it accessible to lay seekers.<br />The most important thing in moving beyond slavery to worldly concerns and toward Theosis (union with God) is the sublimation of our egos and a commitment to Metanoia (transformation of the mind and heart).  This is accomplished by adhering to Ecclesia (comprehensive set of Christian practices, e.g., prayer, fasting, ritual, study).  Now, Evangelicals, don't cover your ears and run away screaming \\"works righteousness\\".  These practices aren't about \\"getting saved\\".  They are about moving to a higher spiritual plane, something Evangelicals pay lip service to but, in fact, DON'T HAVE A CLUE how to accomplish.<br />The conversational, dialog approach to complex subjects makes this a good introduction to Orthodox ideas.  The footnotes and bibliography provide guidance for further pursuing Orthodox beliefs and practices and a three-page glossary provides reference definitions for Greek theological terms that, for this beginner, need to consulted on a regular basis.<br />I recommend this book highly, especially to non-Orthodox Christians who, even though they choose not to \\"convert\\", will find Father Maximos' explanations of the Beatitudes, hell, etc., provide a thought provoking contrast with Protestant and Roman Catholic interpretations.	2002-08-29
US	52492795	R2MNK6DL9A2JPH	0465007201	758212963	The Savage Wars Of Peace: Small Wars And The Rise Of American Power	Books	5	22	27	N	N	Give War a Chance	The Savage Wars of Peace is a fascinating summary of the United States' successes and failures during 200 years and twenty-plus \\"small wars\\" from the Barbary Coast in 1801 to the Philippines in 1899, the Mexican border in 1915, the Yangtze Valley in 1927 and Kosovo in 2000.  This well written book provides both entertainment and food for thought.  Most of these \\"small wars\\", especially the numerous pre-World War II conflicts, are little, if at all, remembered.  Even military professionals seem to have forgotten some of the principles and lessons learned which could have served us well in more recent forays.<br />Besides the entertaining narratives, Boot makes a convincing case that 1) murky conflicts without identifiable conclusions or \\"exit strategies\\" can lead to favorable results (although sometimes it takes hindsight to realize that), 2) fighting styles that limit casualties (on both sides) can achieve lasting results and 3) there have been far more undeclared \\"small wars\\" in American history than big ones and yet the professional military perceives the small wars as aberrations rather than the norm.<br />The Savage Wars of Peace  makes a great jumping off point for detailed study of the individual campaigns.  The 22-page bibliography plus 34 pages of notes provides many starting points for further research.  My only criticisms are that I would like to see more photographs and maps, and the proofreader needs to check more carefully for a few date errors (e.g., on page 305 a Marine unit arrives in Vietnam in June 1966 and then engages in a significant action in September 1965; which year is correct?  This type of thing occurs elsewhere.).<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book and highly recommend it to everyone interested in U.S. history or military history and strategy.	2002-08-06
US	52492795	R1VGBEPANE8V6Q	0700611711	379119260	The Pueblo Incident: A Spy Ship and the Failure of American Foreign Policy	Books	2	35	44	N	N	A Questionable Perspective on this Infamous Incident	As a former Navy spook who served in the Korean Theater during 1969-71, I hoped this book, published on the eve of the 35th anniversary of the North Korean capture of the USS Pueblo, would provide useful new insights into this infamous incident. Unfortunately it does not. More or less consistent accounts of the details surrounding the ship's capture and the crew's imprisonment, and the policy and operational shortcomings up to the senior levels of the US Navy and the National Security Agency, have been published elsewhere over the years. This account adds little of significance in this area.<br />Instead, Professor Lerner focuses on the \\"failure of American policy\\" and the notion that the \\"Cold War mentality directing (United States) policy decisions\\" caused the United States to incorrectly focus on the Pueblo seizure as part of the international communist conspiracy. Professor Lerner assets, unconvincingly in my opinion, that North Korea's attack on the Pueblo was motivated solely by an indigenous ideological concept called \\"juche\\", an extreme form of \\"self-reliance\\" which Lerner says North Korea espoused from 1955 onward.<br />In other words, the attack on the Pueblo was just North Korea's way of asking to be left alone so they could build a peoples' paradise based on \\"having an attitude of a master toward the revolution and construction of one's own country\\"(??). Professor Lerner further asserts that despite the Pueblo attack occurring just eight days before the launch of the Tet offensive in Vietnam, any notion that North Korea ever participated in a concerted effort to support North Vietnam's imposition of totalitarian socialism on South Vietnam was just the result of a tendency by the United States' military to see pro-North Vietnamese adversaries behind every tree. \\"Other evidence (none of which Professor Lerner specifically cites) suggests a lack of cooperation between (North Korea) and Vietnam.\\" Also, Professor Lerner argues that the Russians certainly had no involvement because a former KGB officer told him so in an interview (!) and \\"Soviet complicity might also have threatened ... superpower rapprochement\\" that was allegedly occurring. Finally, he says North Koreans would never act in concert with other totalitarian socialist regimes because such an action might backfire and result in \\"strengthening the position of American 'hawks'\\".<br />The arguments and theories in The Pueblo Incident - A Spy Ship and the Failure of American Foreign Policy are unconvincing.<br />First, Korea practiced \\"juche\\" for hundreds of years as evidenced by the 19th Century characterization of Korea as the \\"Hermit Kingdom\\" for its tendency to attack foreign ships that entered its harbors as well as execute shipwrecked sailors who washed ashore. So what? South Korean society evolved from their isolationist tradition, and even socialist states like Albania and Romania practiced forms of \\"juche\\" from the 1950s through 1990s without attacking, everyone who ventured near their borders. \\"Juche\\" doesn't explain the North Korean need to attack and murder 31 men on a US Navy plane more than 90 miles off their coast in April 1969, their large-scale commando raid on a South Korean island hundreds of miles south of the DMZ, stepped up North Korean aggression that caused more than a 1,000 U.S. and South Korean casualties along the DMZ from 1967 -69, etc. etc.<br />Second, North Koreans have publicly and proudly announced that they collaborated with the North Vietnamese in the 1960s. Their most significant involvement was sending North Korean pilots to fly MIG jet fighters in opposition to American pilots in Vietnam, just as Russians had flown against American pilots in Korea 15 years earlier. There really is evidence to refute assertions of non-involvement by North Korea in Vietnam.<br />Third, no doubt North Korea was something of a renegade to the Soviets and the Russians probably did not know in advance about the attack on the Pueblo. Nevertheless,supporting North Korea was clearly an element of Soviet policy. When the U.S. Navy assembled carrier battle groups in the Sea of Japan the USSR positioned 16 of its surface warships between the US fleet and the North Korean coast, as well as deployed a number of submarines in the area.<br />Yes, the record shows that in many instances the United States misjudged the intention and capability and motivation of our Cold War adversaries (as they did ours). In the aftermath of the attack on the Pueblo the United States assembled a large naval task force and deployed additional Air Force units in the Korean theater which was a prudent response given our commitment to protecting South Korea and Japan and the fact that a state of war still existed in Korea.  Once it was determined the Pueblo attack was not a prelude to greater hostilities, the United States withdrew most of those forces and patiently sought the crew's release through diplomacy and negotiation.  Was that a foreign policy failure?<br />This book has a few interesting photographs I hadn't seen before. I recommend it to people interested in the Cold War and the ongoing Korean conflict history as long as they consult other sources to get a more balanced and complete view of the incident.supporting North Korea was clearly an element of Soviet policy.

The second is the author's spiritual awakening from committed agnosticism to, apparently, embracing his wife's Greek Orthodox faith (naturally non-believing Mr. France spent many years doing religious broadcasting for the BBC).  I say \\"apparently\\" embracing Orthodox Christianity because following what Mr. France seems to consider an \\"experimental\\" baptism he lets the topic fade away.  That's too bad, because Mr. France's evolving spiritual insights are far more interesting than his pale Greek imitation of Peter Mayle's delightful book about French country living,  A Year in Provence.<br />Mr. France starts out ridiculing local monasteries for not adapting to modernity as illustrated by, in his view, their old fashioned insistence on \\"proper dress\\" for tourists coming to gawk at religious art objects (Cover up those bikinis and Speedos sun worshippers!).  Gradually, as he gets to know the local Orthodox community, priests, nuns and lay people alike, his thinking changes.  For example, Mr. France says that as an Oxford University graduate he thought \\"humility\\" meant \\"never make your superiority to others apparent to them\\".  Then, observing some Orthodox nuns at work he concludes \\"real humility... is thinking of others so completely that you do not think of yourself at all.\\"  Mr. France comes to realize, \\"I had been thinking and reading for forty years, slowly amassing knowledge but not advancing in understanding,\\" which he concludes may, after all, only be accessible through means other than human reason.  This eventually leads to his baptism.  This book would have been better and more distinctive if Mr. France focused solely on his spiritual awakening, gave more in-depth profiles of the Orthodox-influenced aspects of the islanders' lives and told us whether or nor he had fully embraced Christianity.<br />Mr. France refers several times to the concept of  \\"cognitive minority\\"; i.e., having a different world view than one's surrounding culture.  As a non-Christian on Patmos he found himself in a cognitive minority, among locals at least.  I have a feeling that when it came time to publish a book that would be visible to the British and North American media elites Mr. France still identifies with he couldn't bring himself fully \\"out of the closet\\" as a believer.<br />Despite the inconclusiveness of Mr. France's spiritual journey, I recommend A Place of Healing for the Soul - Patmos for the person interested in the spiritual development/pilgrimage and moving-beyond-materialism aspect of the book.  The secular local color and British couple-adapts-to-quaint-local-lifestyle part isn't worth the price of admission.	2002-07-20

I'm an adult and I have even have a university degree in geography, but I found Maps and Mapmaking so interesting and useful that I bought a copy for myself.  It doesn't come across as being written specifically for &quot;young people&quot;, but, rather, Ms. Stefoff's writing is just plain straight forward, well crafted and to-the-point (apparently she's not an Academic).  This is a great reference source of 1) &quot;mini-biographies&quot; (all most of really want to know) of famous personalities in mapmaking, exploring, etc., 2) explanations of technical mapmaking and geographic terms (bathymetric maps, antipodes, etc) and 3) mini-essays on topics such as the history of mapmaking in Japan.  Topping it off, throughout the volume there are well-reproduced illustrations, many in full color, of old map reproductions, technical diagrams, etc.  I can't understand why this great book is not sold more widely. It's fun to read through when you first get and then keep as a reference or to share with others.

Nevertheless, he is apparently so dedicated to the notion that journalists have a duty to provide the public with accurate, unbiased information that he has written this book to expose the systematic left-learning slant that dominates print and TV news coverage and editorial opinion.<br />Goldberg debunks the notion that the media can be considered unbiased just because, for example, they often reported negatively on President Clinton (gee, it's kind of hard to put a positive spin on being disbarred in one's home state isn't it?).  The thought provoking perspective that Goldberg presents and documents is the interesting notion that media liberal bias is deeply and subtly institutional rather than overt and conscious.  Journalists, he assets, simply believe that liberal political and social ideas are &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;correct&quot; while any other perspective is intrinsically flawed or ignorant.  For example, journalists assume that the proper person to interview on any women's issue is always a NOW representative and the proper person to interview on any racial issue is always a member of the NAACP establishment.  Someone with a non-liberal perspective must always be identified as conservative or right-wing, while people with a liberal (i.e., &quot;normal and correct&quot;) perspective are not actually called liberals or left-wingers (&quot;the only time the media uses the term &quot;left wing&quot; is to refer to a part of an airplane&quot;).<br />Goldberg says that most members of today's media consider themselves more intelligent, more perceptive and better educated than the general public.  I findsuch a self-view by journalists to be a joke when you consider that the field is littered with ex-beauty queens and people with &quot;communications&quot; degrees that are devoid of any meaningful content in topics like economics, business, history and science.<br />The author says that when he first mentioned Dan Rather as an example of entrenched liberal media bias in an editorial in 1995, he told Dan beforehand about the article and Dan said to him, &quot;We were friends yesterday, we are friends today and we'll be friends tomorrow&quot;.  However, Goldberg says that what Dan really meant was, &quot;As far as I'm concerned you're dead&quot; and has literally never spoken to Goldberg since.  Wow, that Dan's one tough pseudo-Marine!  (Rather likes to tell people that he's a former Marine, but according to the author of Stolen Valor, Rather washed out of the Corps in the 1950s before he could even finish Boot Camp).<br />If you're a liberal read this book thoughtfully and see for yourself whether Goldberg doesn't make some valid points.  If you're a conservative read the book to learn why your worst fears about the media aren't paranoid.  And if you're a news executive read this book to learn why more and more of your audience is rejecting your product because what your journalists tells us doesn't ring true to most Americans' real world experience.	2001-12-04

Mr. Burrows has written a detailed account of United States Air Force, Navy and CIA airborne electronic and photographic reconnaissance efforts from the end of WWII through the US Navy's P3 incident on Hainan in 2001.  The development of specialized aircraft (U-2, SR-71), electronics and camera equipment as well as modification of ordinary aircraft (B-29, B-47, C-130, etc) for reconnaissance missions is covered in sufficient detail to satisfy everyone expect hardcore technical buffs.<br />Besides detailed descriptions of 16 Cold War shootdowns that involved US deaths - many of which did not become widely known until recently - Mr. Burrows presents evidence to support the premise that many crewmen initially survived shootdowns only to be murdered or die in Soviet prisons.  There are also many tales of crews that returned with damaged aircraft, and sometimes wounded men, to their home base or after a period of Soviet incarceration.  The efforts of families of lost crewmen to find out what happened to their relatives, despite stonewalling by both the US and foreign governments, add a deeply human touch to what would otherwise be a recitation of interesting facts and scary war stories.<br />There are lots of footnotes supporting the events described and a number of photographs of lost aircrews and some of the aircraft they flew.  The lack of chronological order throughout the chapters, and frequent flashforwards and flashbacks, make some of the incidents hard to follow or recall.  I would also like to see pictures of each major aircraft mentioned and a summary of all the non-fatal shootdown and attack incidents.  I recommend this book.	2001-11-27

Many medal books focus on personal decorations, but this work, as the subtitle indicates, traces the development of United States Navy and Marine Corps campaign medals from their origin around 1900 through 1996. For each medal there is narrative describing it's creation, usually including a synopsis of the key events of the conflict, requirements to receive the medal, date the medal was issued, and one or more good-sized color photographs. There are also sections on quasi-official pre-1930 commemorative medals, Arctic and Antarctic service medals, attachment devices, unit citations and other ribbon-only awards, foreign campaign medals, and some information for estimating the age or authenticity of old medals.    The emphasis on pre-WWII campaign medals such as China Relief Expedition Medal (the Boxer Rebellion), Nicaraguan Campaign Medals (there are two!) and Yangtze Service Medal (think \\"Sand Pebbles\\") along with period photographs of sailors and marines wearing those medals is the most interesting part of the book. In many instances there are lists (but not specific service dates) of specific ships that were awarded certain medals, which adds to the appeal of this book as a source for historical studies.    I enjoy skimming this book frequently for historical tidbits and sharing it with people interested in U.S. Navy and American History. Buy it!	2001-08-29

Although the pace slows a bit toward the end, despite knowing the eventual outcome this is a real page-turner about some historical events that are not widely known.<br />Gannon concentrates on the background, strategy and techniques of the initial German submarine attacks on shipping along the United States' East Coast in the early months of 1942, which the Germans called Operation Drumbeat.  Despite the British Royal Navy passing on timely, accurate intelligence about the pending attack, this book documents the disorganization and incompetence with which the U.S. Navy responded to the initial German submarine assault that sunk dozens of ships and killed hundreds of people literally within sight of American cites and towns from New England to Florida and, eventually, the Gulf coast.<br />Gannon's interesting technique is to focus his account on the still living, at least as of 1990, captain and crew members of U-123 which was one of the boats that participated in the mission.  U-123 scored a number of kills from New York to Florida, sometimes operating so close to shore that they could hear the music from beachfront honkytonks.  The true story of the U-123 mission has many elements of the tale told in the German movie Das Boot, right down to an out-of-place propaganda journalist accompanying the patrol.<br />Buy Operation Drumbeat, crank up the soundtrack to Das Boot (also available from Amazon in an expensive but well-worth-it CD) and return to the exciting days of 1942 when the outcome of the titanic struggle between good and evil known as World War II was still uncertain!	2001-08-17

Besides updated boundaries, etc., compared to prior editions it makes much better use of shading to indicate topography and has more detailed city maps.  I buy an atlas primarily for the maps, and it's the maps that make the NGS Atlas superior to all others.    The traditional NGS \\"look\\" sometimes seems dated compared to the flashier colors and trendy graphics employed by some other publishers.  However, the more I study the maps, the more information I find in them.  A few years ago I did a comparison of this NGS with the most recent edition of the much more expensive Times Atlas of the World for a professional geographer's meeting.  I was amazed to find that many of the NGS maps of North America had more than twice as many place names and named physical features as the Times Atlas.  I also found the NGS Atlas maps equal or superior to the Times' maps for parts of the Middle East and northeast Asia with which I'm familiar (frankly, I found the 10th Edition Times Atlas inferior to the prior edition in several regards; for example, the elevation colors are far less discernable and detailed city maps have been virtually eliminated).  Despite contrary opinions by some other reviewers, I judge the National Geographic Atlas maps to be far and away superior in content and sheer volume of information presented to all the other \\"high end\\" atlases published by Oxford, Hammond and DK.  In fact, I couldn't justify recommending any of the other atlases (except possibly the Times, which, I admit, does offer fantastic detail for village names in the rural plains of India where I hope to never visit) to a library.    The National Geographic Society Atlas of the World is a great investment for travel planning, tracking current events, studying geography and history or just reading maps for pleasure.  I recommend it highly.	2001-07-31

This book describes how the US Army's famed American Expeditionary Force (AEF) under General Pershing came to play a decisive role in concluding the war on the Western Front on terms favorable to the Allies.<br />It was fascinating to learn that the general staff organization created by Pershing in WWI, derived from observations he made as an attaché to the Japanese army in Manchuria in 1905 (!), is still used by the US Army today. Furthermore, as Eisenhower points out in his epilogue, the hugely successful US Army of World War II would not have been possible without the organization and skills developed by the AEF in 1917-18, when future WWII Army Chief of Staff George Marshall was a Lt. Colonel responsible for operations planning in the AEF.<br />However, I do not agree [that]...this is a well written book. While I enjoyed learning about the accomplishments of the AEF and its effect on the United States' subsequent victories in WWII, in my opinion the story is told in a tedious manner. Much of the text is devoted to describing the attributes of relatively obscure colonels and generals and dozens of leadership shuffles among them at the regimental, brigade and division level. Military actions are described in difficult-to-follow chronologies that provide no \\"feel\\" for the action. Little detail and specific data are provided to illustrate how the remarkable feats of mobilization, training, transportation and communications were actually accomplished. And in a strange departure from the predominant, colorless descriptions from the command-point-of-view, toward the book's end Eisenhower inserts, randomly, a few battlefield recollections from two low-ranking soldiers in the style of Stephen Ambrose's GI-view of WWII, Citizen Soldier.<br />This book encourages me to read more about the AEF because I don&#8217;t feel Yanks tells the story of the AEF either as completely or colorfully as it deserves to be told.	2001-07-31
US	52492795	R6LPU4MZTHB3W	0679731148	669003939	A Year in Provence	Books	5	5	7	N	N	A Book About Nothing	In somewhat the same manner that the former NBC television sitcom, The Jerry Seinfeld Show, was a &quot;show about nothing&quot;, A Year In Provence is a &quot;book about nothing&quot;.<br />In the late 1980s, Peter Mayle and his wife move from a gray January in London to a sunny new life in rural Provence in the south of France.  The book tracks the first year of their residence, month-by-month.  In a typical month there's a wind storm, a delivery truck collapses into the septic tank, they purchase rugs from itinerants who arrive in a Mercedes, the neighboring farmer converts a melon patch to a vineyard and they spend lots of time shopping for food and eat a fantastic meal prepared by an 80 year old chef in a local restaurant.  The only recurring story line concerns the masons, plumbers, electricians and other tradesmen who come and go throughout the year on a seemingly interminable remodeling of Mayle's 200 year old stone farm house.  It may be a book about nothing, but it works.<br />The reason it works is that any reader can identify with the author. Mayles demonstrates no particular skill in cooking, French, sports, home repair or any other activity.  He never says anything very specific about the politics, art or human and natural history of Provence.  Rather, he and his wife just enjoy their lives by reveling in the changing seasonal weather and light patterns, getting to know their neighbors and how they make a living, walking the dogs and looking forward to the day all the workmen's tools and building materials will disappear.  In short, they're doing what any of us could do if we lived in an interesting place and took time to enjoy just being there instead of feeling we had to justify our existence by &quot;keeping busy&quot;.  By the end of the book, reflecting on how long it might take to get some help in completing a new project at his house, Mayle decides it's not important to finish it in any particular length of time: &quot;We were beginning to thinkin seasons instead of days or weeks.&quot;<br />Read this book, and then go live the life you have imagined.<br />(My only complaint about this thoroughly delightful book is the frequent inclusion, without translation, of snatches of conversation in French.)	2001-07-25

I've hardly read any novels in 30 years, generally enjoying history and other nonfiction, but this was a great read that I couldn't put down, and that I recommend it highly.<br />Beside the well developed, believable characters and multiple interesting story lines, Russo delivers hundreds of memorable one-liners and vivid scene descriptions.  No doubt this will be made into a movie.<br />The main character, Miles Roby, constantly reflects on the &quot;mistake&quot; he made 20 years earlier by coming back to his terminally depressed hometown of Empire Falls, Maine and running a short order grill rather than finishing college and being the professor he imagined becoming.  And yet, what's missing in his life?  He is liked and respected, serves on the school board and provides other valued community services, is raising a fine daughter, has multiple social relationships, is surrounded by people who care about him and lives in a community with no traffic congestion.  Is any of this worse than his plight might be in a soulless upscale suburb, sunbelt city or congested metro area surrounded by people who know and care little about him?  Sure, Miles is no financial success, his wife left him and many of the people he knows have striking character flaws.  But those things can happen anywhere.  Being a lifelong resident of Empire Falls doesn't sound so bad to me.	2001-07-16

Hewitt defines &quot;bystanders&quot; as Christians who are embarrassed to publicly articulate and live out their beliefs and values in an age when media elites and popular culture denigrate, if not out-and-out deride or ridicule, religious believers, particularly Christians.<br />Hewitt asserts, probably correctly, that although media elites put up a facade of widespread indifference or hostility to traditional religious values, the number of people in America who actually share the media's view is relatively small (IF they would turn off the tube long enough to think about it).<br />Ironically, while Hewitt repeatedly states that popular culture has descended to a dangerous level of incoherent, violent, immoral chaos, he says that he goes to see practically every new movie with anything other than an NR rating.  Talk about a disconnect! Also, while he argues that Christians need to more fully engage the culture rather than retreat from it, he doesn't provide many specific suggestions for doing so.<br />I think the best &quot;action step&quot; Hewitt suggests is for Christians to become more active in cultural and social institutions (presumably as shining examples to others) rather than trying, in vain, to change the country through the political process.  Think about it: social phenomenon and cultural abominations arise from an immoral or amoral society, and then we propose to improve or turnaround the situation through laws and government programs rather than through active participation in the society.  Doesn't make much sense, does it?  Also, Hewitt points out that rather than merely boycotting things we don't like (which seldom seems to accomplish anything positive as far as I can tell), Christians should actively support, with dollars and encouragement, things we likeand want to see more of.  &quot;Find something good and praise it.&quot;	2001-07-14

However, the restaurant listings are far too incomplete to really use this as a comprehensive source of advice for long road trips. Even &quot;500+&quot; listings have to get spread pretty thin over a country as large as the good old USA! And be warned, this is a meat eater's book that lists LOTS of steak houses, hot dog stands, hamburger joints and bar-b-q spots.<br />There is an average of about 10-12 places listed for each state, with no apparent relationship between the size of the state and the number of restaurants listed: Maine gets 20 listings (surprise, there're a lot of lobster shacks along the coast up there!) while New York gets just 19, and our largest state, California, only gets 26 (of which 70% are in SF, LA and San Diego).<br />Western states are particularly sparsely covered. There are only 7 tips for Colorado, but the Sterns guide us to 16 culinary Meccas in Alabama. The Sterns can't find even one place to list in Phoenix (admittedly not a great restaurant city, although I managed to find a few good spots the last time I was there). &quot;Oh well, Mildred, there's nothin' here, we'll just have to drive a few hundred more miles to LA before we can eat.&quot;<br />Based on the authors' selection of restaurants for the area of the country where I live, Seattle, I concluded that the Sterns have no more insight into the identities of good local restaurants than you can find in a typical travel guide. My experience is that most conventional city and regional guidebooks list at least as many worthwhile places as the Sterns and they are usually written by locals who really do know some of good spots.  For metro areas I've had good results with the Zagat surveys.	2001-07-02

And the story IS too drawn out.  And there isn't even all that much actual walking; Feiler rides camels up Mt Sinai and Mt. Aaron and drives to the top of Mt. Nebo.<br />Nevertheless, Feiler presents a lot of interesting thoughts on the meaning of the Old Testament Biblical stories, their applications to ourselves, and the possible roots of the development of the Jewish people and their culture which is so foundational to Western morals and culture.  Whether or not you agree with Feiler, I'm sure some of his theories will stimulate your own counter-thoughts and inspire additional research. <br />Therefore, although I don&#8217;t believe this will prove to be either a travel or spiritual classic, I suggest you read it if you have an interest in Feiler's topic.<br />I discovered a number of odd errors in the book which make me concerned as to how many mistakes there are on topics I'm not familiar with.  Feiler asserts on page 4 that Mt. Ararat \\"is the highest peak in the Middle East (and the second highest in Europe)\\".  That is only true if you simultaneously define Iran as NOT being in the Middle East (even though it is) and redefine the Middle East as part of Europe (which it is not).  Even then, the highest mountains in Europe are in the Caucasus and there are at least three peaks in that range higher than Ararat.  He also describes a vehicle as a \\"Toyota Land Rover\\"; the Land Rover has been a world famous British-made vehicle for many years while Toyota has makes an excellent vehicle called the Land Cruiser.<br />Another ... reviewer wonders why famous Israeli archeologist Avner Goren would bother to spend so many months traveling with Feiler.  Without Goren's knowledge, field experience and contacts Feiler wouldn't have had much of a story to tell.  Well, as they say, \\"follow the money\\".  According to an interview with Feiler I saw in a newspaper in Virginia last week, Feiler paid Goren to travel with him as his guide for most of the trip.<br />In his last chapter, Feiler describes a number of books he relied on in planning his travels and writing the book.  One he mentions favorably is Dalrymple's From the Holy Mountain, which covers almost the identical trip as Feiler except rather than following the route of Old Testament events, Dalrymple follows the route of a 6th century Christian monk.  Although the topic is not the same, I found Dalrymple's book both better written and more insightful (it regards Christianity, of course, rather than Judaism) and I recommend it very highly.	2001-05-26

I spent two months last winter in a mountain cabin far up a back road in Washington's Methow Valley, just below the Canadian border and just east of the North Cascade National Park, where there are many cougars.  One broke into my nearest neighbor's house and I found fresh tracks one morning beside the road into town.  So with all the cougar excitement in the Valley, I decided to learn more about them.  This recently published softcover book is one place to start if you want to know more about the big cats that are becoming a more common part of life throughout the West.    Mountain Lion (Cox and Grambo) is a medium format photo essay of 99 spectacular color photographs of cougars running, jumping, caring for their young, attacking deer and so forth.  These remarkable pictures, mostly taken in southwestern red rock country, give a real feel for how the animals move through their territory.  However, after initially being stunned by the images, I was disappointed to read that they were taken \\"mainly with captive-bred mountain lions under controlled conditions\\".  Well, the cougars LOOK wild and at least none of them are wearing sunglasses or have their kitty litter boxes visible.  The brief text is a well-written essay about the cougar's natural history and human interaction, and there is a bibliography, but, for me, the book loses stars for being so heavily reliant on photographs of semi-captive cougars.	2001-05-26

When his body was found it was deduced that the young victim had cut off one of the cougar's front claws (!) while unsuccessfully defending himself with a pocketknife.  Contemporary cougar fans may find poetic justice in descriptions of two recent non-fatal incidents where National Park campers were forced by cougars to spend the night up in a tree (!) until someone came to their assistance.

But this book is a tremendous disappointment. Kottler's idea of an example of transforming  travel is a woman on a business trip blocking out some self-indulgent  feel-good time so she can can &quot;feel less guilty (about neglecting her  children) because I am pursuing a career so ambitiously&quot;.  Hey, any  man or woman who thinks selling potato chips or filing legal briefs is more  important that their children SHOULD  feel guilty. And Kottler is so  ignorant it's hard to believe he has a high school diploma, much less a  Ph.D.  For example, he tells a boring, pointless story about a terrible  experience during a 14-hour drive in the Philippines.  Then Kottler says he  and his wife recover from the ordeal by traveling to Hong Kong and,  &quot;crossing the international dateline&quot; they are able to spend the  same day more pleasantly.  Dr. Kottler, check your map: the international  date line DOES NOT RUN between Manila and Hong Kong, and when you cross it  traveling from east to west you arrive in the NEXT day not the prior one.  Don't waste your money on this one.  Maybe I should have been more  sceptical of a book about creating transformative travel experience written  by somebody who lives in Las Vegas!	1999-08-16
