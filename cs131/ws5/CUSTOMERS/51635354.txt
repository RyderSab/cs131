I used to play the King's Indian against both 1 d4 and 1 e4 and I know exactly what he means. Although the fianchetto setup is very solid defensively in the opening, the bishop lacks offensive punch, especially if c3 is played after d4. In fact, I'm currently studying ways to defeat the bishop fianchetto setup using the Fritz 8 database (although I'm a d4 player, the fianchetto setup is also fallable, but much tougher than, say the Queen's Indian).  If white doesnt move his c- and d-pawns after d4 and c3, what does the black king's bishop have to strike? Granite? Meanwhile, since the center is usually still at least semi-closed white can trade off his Bishop, keep his queen at h6, and then pawn storm and minor piece black into oblivion.<br />The modified pirc I'm playing to correct this problem involves something like this: 1 e4 d6   2 d4 Nf6   3 Bd3 h6?! (I do not want Bg5)   4 Nf3 Bg4   5 h3 Bh5   6 0-0 a6?! (again, no Bb5 to harass my precious knights, which are about to help close the center) 7 Nc3 Nc6   8 Bf4  Nd7!? (often chased to this square by the bishop or e-pawn, but this time it's on offensive repositioning)  9 Re1 e5   <BR>Usually d5 will follow, but dxe5 is easily met by a multiple minor piece exchange, that favors the side with less space (black). <br />Now, with 10 d5, black will play ...Nb8 ...Be7, ...0-0, and have a nice game after ...f5. Remember that in a closed center, moves like h6 and a6 do not lose important tempos as they would in an open system. And unlike, Bg7, the Be7 is poised to be traded off to facilitate a kingside attack by black, not white!	2004-06-28

He takes the same arrogant, lofty, and unaccessible attitude that many college professors do. If they can't explain something in 5 seconds, they get frustrated and blame it on the student. Yasser Seirawan is much more patient and objective about training lower-ranked players. I suggest you buy his Winning Chess Tactics, and Winning Chess Strategies, instead.<br />Also, I'm a firm believer in reverse analysis, which many top players absolutely disdain. Their argument is: &quot;how can you say that the resignation on move 41 occurred because of  a move on 25? There are a million possible moves between those two!&quot;. Yes, there are a million POSSIBLE moves, but there were only 32 moves THAT WERE ACTUALLY PLAYED.  If an amateur (or even a letter-rated player of A, B, C, D) performs reverse analysis on their games, it will help more than any book will. You need to know WHY your &quot;attacking&quot; pawn move at move 15 led to a weakened pawn structure that your opponent took advantage of at move 23, and won the game on move 32. Write down your moves, replay the game forward, then at the loss move, put the pieces and pawns back in reverse order. Then you will see why you lost. And that's not an arrogant way to teach, either.	2004-03-25

Quickly purchasing this book after that discovery, my white game has since improved significantly. In fact, last week I beat an experienced player with the Tromp in 15 moves. However, I do think that 2 Bg5 is not a necessary move, if you don't intend to take the N on f6 or chase it away. 2...Ne4 can cause complications, especially if black subsequently plays c5, Qb6, Bf5, etc.That can get VERY tricky to defend against. I humbly suggest 2...Bf4 instead. That way, e5 is secured, and the N on f6 must take 2 moves to threaten the B on f4. Also if black simply plays 1...d5, then 2 Bf4 is fine as well. c5 is met by Nf6, cxd5 by Nxd5, and Black cannot play e5 due to the Bishop at f4. I also really like playing c3 and Nd2, since it can help possible queenside castling. e3 then c4 is also fine if Black hasn't played c5 yet. One thing is for sure: if both White and Black have castled kingside, 80%+ of the action will be on the queenside. In the book, the only way to force mate on the kingside is to move both knights several times and with throw in some sacrifices, but this opening is no better than any other for a tactical White player to do that. Focus on the queenside and center.	2004-01-06

I was wrong! The book is very educational and even somewhat practical. Most importantly, it has given me a new philosophy about why some cultures have developed countries and why some don't. The traditional socio-economic division in the world is between the east and west, that is, the \\"liberal\\" western tradition and the more  convervative and subservient cultures of eastern and southeastern asia (Campbell divides them at the country of Iran). But he also brilliantly realizes that there is another, possibly even more important socio-economic division in the world---north and south! The reason for this is that cultures who live north of the tropic of cancer usually have cold winters, where nothing grows, and they must diligently plan for the grain harvests each year. These northern cultures, which include Japan, Korea, and northern China as well as Europe, must be very organized to deal with the harsh climate, and with this organization eventually came developed nations. This is in contrast to the cultures of the world that live between the tropic of cancer and the tropic of capricorn (with the hot equator in the middle). These warm-climate cultures do not need to worry about seasonal changes nearly as much, and spent their free time pursuing other, less organized activities such as superstition and tribal warfare. Thus, in the race to develop their nations, they fell behind by several hundred or even thousands of years. I think that there is nothing politically incorrect about this statement; it is just simply ironic that a culture blessed with a good climate is cursed with a lack of motivation to organize and develop their country. Campbell's hypothesis explains a great deal about the state of world affairs today, and why the northern cultures have generally toned down or abandoned religion, while the warm-climatecultures have embraced superstition and religious fanaticism to the point of world crisis (ex. the middle east).	2003-02-04

I have a number of minor skin problems and this book allowed me to differentiate the insignificant ones from the ones I need to pay attention to. I think that this book should be in every household, because a person or parent should know what skin affliction(s) they have and how serious they are before they rush off to the doctor. One thing that should have been elaborated on more is the sub-section on The Nails as Clues to Multiorgan Disease. There are only a few pages of examples of this, yet there are dozens of correlations between abnormal fingernails and systemic disease. The book only gives blantant and graphic examples of serious nail problems and then gives the possible associated underlying disease. It should be expanded to include more &quot;soft sign&quot; nail problems to help doctors make educated guesses about what tests to run.	2003-01-29

Since then, some important strides have been made in the field of Immunology, and the book has grown about 50% thicker. However, many themes are repeated too often in the book. 1/2 of a sentence is OK to stress repetition in learning concepts, but often they repeat entire paragraphs 4 or 5 times to strike home a point. If they were to get rid of all those redundant paragraphs, the book would be leaner and meaner and less boring to read. One of the most interesting concepts in the book deals with the Th1/Th2 immune switch, which occurs in allergic patients. The authors classically define this switch simply as going from microbial immunity to allergen immunity. But in my opinion, Th1 to Th2 switches do much more than that. They can affect whether an allergic person is more or less immune to microbes, whether they are differentially immune (ex. more immune to viruses, less to bacteria), and also may significantly affect the person's behavior. Behavior, you ask? What does the immune system have to do with behavior? A lot! Histamine is released during the Th1 to Th2 switch, and Histamine is a neurotransmitter. Also, Serotonin is usually released along with Histamine, and you should know that Serotonin is a key neurotransmitter. The immune system affects the central nervous system much more than many researchers understand. For a more elaborate review of this phenomenon, you can read the book The Failures of American Medicine.	2003-01-29

This book works pretty good. I still get some occasional pain in my wrists and elbows, after a long day (and evening) at the computer, but the exercises help about 80-90%. You don't have to do all of the exercises in the book; I do 10 of them, and those ten take up 7 minutes daily. Not a big price to pay for avoiding carpal tunnel syndrome! There are other things you can do to prevent or reduce CTS, like taking a B-complex vitamin supplement daily. I take 25 mg a day; 50 mg is also fine. Don't buy the extended-release forms---they can cause liver damage. Taking vitamin B6 alone may also help, but don't take more than 100 mg/day for extended periods, because you could wind up with even more nerve damage than before. For a detailed list of nutritional supplements and their potential side effects, the book The Failures of American Medicine is a good reference.	2003-01-29

At first I was impressed by the book, but later I began to realize that if just wouldn't help everyone out there who have stress in their lives. Tolle is absolutely correct about the positive \\"power\\" of thinking in the present, instead of worrying about the past or the future. However, some of his collateral comments are eccentric to say the least, and he comes across as someone who has seen and touched god, and if you spend money to buy his book, maybe you can touch god too! Look, if you want to fall for that stuff, you might as well enroll in the Church of Scientology. Like I said in the review title, someone who has been traumatized over a recent event may find some help in reading this book---it may get their neurotransmitters back in line sooner than if they havent read the book. But for someone who has had generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder for years, the chance of cognitive therapy (psychotherapy, meditation, practicing congnitive therapies in books like these, etc.) working is slim. This is because many people have a genetic basis for their anxiety, and CANNOT HELP worrying about the past and future. Unlike people who have had a temporary emotional setback and can read a book like this to get back to mental health, people with a family history of mental illness have neurotransmitters that are permanently unbalanced, and usually need drug treatment. So, before you buy the book, think about what is causing your anxiety, and ask your relatives if they feel the same as you, and for how long they have felt that way. Then you can decide to buy books like these, or to finally take the big walk into the psychiatrist's office. If you do decide to see a psychiatrist, you may want to try some natural therapies first. Some are safe, and some are dangerous, so you need to consult a book to help you. One of the best is titled The Failures of American Medicine.	2003-01-29

This book is the main undergraduate cell biology text required, and rightly so. However, although it browses all of the sub-fields within the gigantic field of cell biology, it overemphasizes some fields and neglects others. The shortcomings of this text are a classic example of how experts in one field assume that related material will be covered in a related text, and when that invariably doesn't happen, everyone points fingers at each other and nothing changes.<br />The main shortcoming I am talking about is the field of Signal Transduction. This text very briefly gives a few pathways, and assumes that other texts dealing with Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Immunology, and Physiology/Pharmacology will take up the slack. Nothing could be further from the truth! Most undergraduate Biochemistry texts do give several dozen pathways, but these almost never continue on to gene transcription, a critical part of signal transduction. Molecular Biology texts like Genes VI only give examples of a membrane-to-DNA pathway, and the Immunology texts only give immune-related pathways. Signal transduction is by far the most important aspect of modern cell biology, and yet it is the most neglected sub-field in the texts! This needs to be corrected.	2003-01-23

For undergraduates in the physical sciences (Physics, Astronomy, Engineering, Computer Science, Math, and Chemistry), this book is great. If someone has a good math background in Trig and Calculus they should be able to understand almost everything. Where I think it may fail is in its application for undergraduates in the Life Sciences (Biology, possibly Psychology if they are hard-core enough to take a physics class). Half of all science majors are Biology majors, and it's not fair that they have to read the same text that physical science undergraduates read. Most biology programs do not require trigonometry to be taken, so a biology major will quickly be lost reading this book. <br />Also, life scientists like me can easily figure out things like optics, but are very confused by the terminology of Physics. For example, in Biology a &quot;cell membrane&quot; is a very understandable term. It's the protein-lipid bilayer that surrounds a cell and is semi-permeable to small molecules. It's common sense---anyone can understand it. But in physics, the terminology in this text is anything but common-sense. I will give you two examples. First they define torque as &quot;the moment-arm of rotation about an axis&quot;. I understand rotation about an axis, but what the heck is a &quot;moment arm&quot;? Define that please! Second, they define magnetism as the flux force through a charged area. I understand charges, areas, but flux force? This is why lay people and life scientists hate physics, because the terminology is deliberately arcane. Don't just define the terms, explain them!	2003-01-23

The two diabolically opposed gurus are Dr. Atkins, with a recommendation of almost 90% of calories coming from fat and protein, and Dr. Ornish, who recommends only 10% of calories via fat and protein. Drs Eades recommend a diet much closer to the Atkins diet. They recommend eating as much protein as you can, and don't worry about fat. This is good advice for obese patients looking to lose over 50 pounds, but may not be a great maintenance diet. A better long-term diet would be more like the one Dr. Sears recommends in his \\"Zone\\" books, which is 40% carbs and 60% fat and protein. In fact, my balance is about 50/50 and I'm about where I want to be. Just remember to include a good amount of protein in every meal, and avoid large carb-ridden snacks, and you'll lose weight. As far as Ornish's diet is concerned, well, SOME people have an excellent insulin metabolism system and can handle 90% carbs, but most of us CANNOT. 90% carbs is ridiculous, and is the main reason for American illnesses such as Diabetes, Hypertension, and Heart Disease, and in my opinion, even Cancer. The theoretical and statistical basis for these claims can be found in the book entitled The Failures of American Medicine.	2003-01-22

Panic Attacks & Phobias: A Consumer's Guide to Getting Treatment That Works	Books	5	18	20	N	N	Dr. Granoff is a rarity in Medicine---objective	The book is absolutely perfect for those suffering from panic disorder. Granoff makes an excellent, excellent point, one that all primary care physicians and psychiatrists should read again and again until it's seared into their memory: the only patients with panic disorder that need antidepressants are ones who have depression as a PRIMARY symptom, not a secondary symptom. All others with panic disorder need benzodiazepines. Now, first let me say that I only 90% agree with that brilliant statement. For the lay readers out there, you may not see the brilliance---it may look like a total boring common-sense statement. But you don't understand how brainwashed the medical community is about antidepressants and benzodiazepines. Antidepressants like SSRI's and the newer ones like Remeron, Effexor, Serzone, and Wellbutrin are patented, while all benzodiazepines are generic. What does that mean? It means that generics get no positive publicity, only negative, while brand-name patented drugs get billions and billions of dollars worth of sleek, catchy advertisement, including the sales pitch that \\"antidepressants can help panic disorder\\". The reality is that antidepressants can help only about 1/3 with panic disorder, dont do much for about 40% of patients, and actually WORSEN panic symptoms in about 1/4 of people. And the 1/3 that get helped almost certainly have major depression as the primary diagnosis, AND the major depression is the primary cause of their panic disorder. Antidepressants are delayed stimulants; they will not give you a panic attack in minutes like too much caffiene can---it may take days for the antidepressant to induce more anxiety. That anxiety may fade later, or for many patients, it will never fade. For people who have only mild depression and prominent anxiety/panic, benzodiazepines are the primary therapy. A small amount of antidepressant may help, since the overstimulation caused by them is dose-dependent. For a more detailed review of these issues, I recommend the book The Failures of American Medicine.	2003-01-15

For some readers, this may be helpful and reassuring that a PhD also has anxiety and has at least partially corrected it with pharmacotherapy. The therapy Mz. Sahley chooses is Valerian root, which does have some anxiety-reducing properties. Obviously, the people like her that take valerian instead of benzodiazepines (ex. Xanax) and/or antidepressants are looking for a natural solution to their anxiety, and I don't blame them for that. What they don't understand is that large amounts of Valerian taken daily can cause physical dependence just like Xanax can, because they \\"hit\\" and downregulate the same GABA receptor. Thus, when either Valerian or Xanax is abruptly withdrawn, not enough GABA can signal the GABA receptor to inhibit excess neurotransmission, and seizures, coma, or even death can result. Valerian may also cause liver damage. Finally, for any of you thinking about taking GABA itself, it cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, and it therefore useless as a brain supplement (Valerian's active compounds and Xanax CAN cross the barrier).  So, unfortunately for people with pure-state anxiety, there are no natural shortcuts or quick fixes. Vitamin C may help somewhat, but not completely. There are dozens of vitamins and minerals that may act as antidepressants, and if your anxiety stems from being depressed, these supplements may reduce your anxiety. If your anxiety is more pure-state, be careful, these supplements may worsen it!  Billy Jay puts her heart and soul into this book, and I admire that, but the book is basically useless and chock-full of grammatical errors. If you want to read a book that really objectively deals with anxiety and depression, I recommend The Failures of American Medicine.	2003-01-15

I love playing black, and I do believe that this defence is one the black's best. However, it's very easy for white to disrupt before black even sets it up. If black plays c5, expecting white to advance his pawn to d5, white can simply dxc5. Classical theory is against white's decision, since you aren't supposed to exchange center pawns for side pawns. But with one move, white has completely destroyed any chances for black to set up the Benoni. I play a modified version of the Benoni that is also similar to the King's Indian Defence. Instead of focusing on closing the c and d files, I try to close the d and e files. I only play e6 and d6 first, then wait for white to advance, then close the center. But to me, e5 is the most important square on the board to control, so fight for that square! If black can control that square, he can launch a kingside attack much easier than white can.	2003-01-14

All other information was confusing. Even after Soltis described &quot;why&quot; one player's position won or lost the game, I STILL didn't understand why. The only advice I have for intermediate players is that, if you play black, the most important square to defend is e5. I use a variation of the King's Indian Defence (with Nd7 instead of Nf6), to close the center with black pawns at e5 and d4, then launch a kingside attack. Everyone thinks that getting pieces outside the pawn chain is an advantage, but if you advance pawns wisely, the opponent will be squeezed for space, and control of e5 by black hampers any white kingside attack.	2003-01-14

This book does not. If this book had the hundreds of journal articles needed to back up Dr. Hoffer's claims, I would have given it a 4 or 5 star rating. The bottom line is that if a scientific book does not have any references, they may as well be telling you that the world is flat. Time and time again Dr. Hoffer says that he has evidence about the effectiveness of this vitamin or that. Put in the references, Dr. Hoffer!<br /> Part of the book is good---it recommends a balanced diet with no processed foods. This mantra reminds of the conversation I once had with a German exchange student in my laboratory. I was walking by him and his German ladyfriend, who was smoking, and I joked \\"Hey, how come you Germans smoke and drink, but still live as long as us Americans do?\\" Well, the German student thought long and hard about my \\"joke\\", and came up with an answer. He said that in Europe, there are hardly any fast-food restaurants and no supermarkets. All food is much more fresh and has a much shorter shelf life, and since its located in small stores, the inventory is quickly rotated. So his conclusion is that the processed foods shortened the American life span to that of Germans, who smoke and drink much more than we do. In other words, if someone does not smoke, drink, or eat processed foods, they should live to at least 90 years old, not 75.<br /> Some other parts of the book are not very good. Dr. Hoffer claims that all vitamins are safe---they are not!!! He recommends megadosing with vitamins B3, B6, and vitamin C. Of these three vitamins, only C is safe to megadose with. B3 megadosing can cause liver damage and panic attacks, and if someone is also on psychiatric medication, they could die from the serotonin syndrome, the same syndrome that kills some users of the illegal drug Extasy. B6 may also cause the serotonin syndrome if mixed with psychiatric medication, and even by itself, megadosing with B6 can produce permanent peripheral nerve damage.

First, the book offers about 900 pages on symptom diagnosis, and about half a paragraph on the types of psychiatric medications that are effective for the particular diagnosis. 95% of diagnoses have absolutely no recommendations for treatment. <br /> This leads to the second problem: differentiation of primary vs. secondary symptoms. The primary symptoms are the cornerstone of diagnosis. The secondary symptoms take way too much space in this book, and are generally not helpful in making a diagnosis, because the vast majority of secondary symptoms overlap in most mental illnesses. The important use for secondary symptoms is for the type of therapy that should be used (psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy). For example, if two patients are depressed, the diagnosis is made from primary symptoms (tiredness, irritability, difficulty concentrating, psychomotor retardation). However, if patient \\"A\\" has no significant secondary symptoms like anxiety or insomnia, they can take a high dose of SSRI or Effexor. But if patient \\"B\\" has the secondary symptoms of prominent anxiety and insomnia, Remeron or Serzone may be more helpful, and perhaps a benzodiazepine can be added. <br /> The DSM IV does nothing to further the practicality of psychiatry. And that's a shame, because only a few hundred extra pages of pharmacotherapy recommendations would make the book so much more helpful to psychiatrists, who currently waste a lot of time experienting with every drug for the treatment-resistant patients. Some drugs work better for some people based on secondary symptoms, which cannot be ignored in the choice of drug treatment. A good book that does match secondary symptoms to drug treatment is The Failures of American Medicine.	2002-12-19

That means it's readable for students, patients, professors, and medical doctors. And there is some very interesting information in here. For example, blue-eyed people have more anxiety than green- or brown-eyed people, and this may be from a difference in neurotransmitters that help determine eye color! Hard to believe, isn't it. The reason why I didn't give this book 5 stars is because of their recommendations on pharmacology treatment of anxiety, or should I say, lack of recommendations. Throughout the whole book they have tried to be objective, stating that many different psychologists fight over the \\"proper\\" treatments for different anxious conditions, and that the authors want to give all sides equal time in the book. What they were not objective about is the fact that up to 50% of all anxious people will not be cured by psychotherapy alone, and do need (either temporarily or permanently) anxiolytic medication. And when they finally do mention anti-anxiety drugs, they mention some of the worst ones, including MAO inhibitors (NEVER TAKE THEM), and beta-blockers (can cause respiratory depression and severe low blood pressure). And when they mention benzodiazepines (valium-type sedatives), they say that the only side effects from them are sedation. Benzodiazepines are very important in the treatment of many different anxiety conditions, but the readers need to be warned that they can cause physical dependence---a truly important side effect. Finally, even though the book was published in 1995, they don't even mention SSRI's like Prozac and Zoloft at all. I can't believe they would recommend an MAO inhibitor and not an SSRI. SSRI's are just as effective for anxiety as MAOI's, but do not have any potentially lethal side effects. How does someone know if they need a benzodiazepine, and antidepressant, or both for their anxiety? The book The Failures of American Medicinedetails what anxiolytic drugs are appropriate for the various anxiety conditions, and is available here at Amazon.com.	2002-11-14

The percentages of the two kinds of patients is roughly 50/50%. If a patient is bothered by the side effects of benzodiazepines or just by the simple fact that they want to discontinue a much-maligned drug, this is the book to do it. That's why I gave it 5 stars. But there is a problem---after a patient on long-term benzodiazepine therapy goes off of them, they usually have to practice elaborate cognitive and breathing techniques every time they feel anxiety for the rest of their lives! These patients have to ask themselves if this alternative is actually worth not having to take a pill or two a day for the rest of their lives. It's up to them to decide. <br /> Most patients to not develop a tolerance to benzodiazepines, and often maintain more or less the same dosage for life. An aerobic exercise regimen, a proper diet with plenty of protein, proper vitamin and mineral supplements, and a LOW dose of an antidepressant can help the patient reduce their benzodiazepine use, or even stop it, possibly even without having to practice the techniques of this book. These \\"other\\" techniques described above are elaborated in a chapter of my book, The Failures of American Medicine, available at Amazon ...	2002-10-10

Therefore I did not have high expectations for reading this book. I was very pleasantly surprised. This is a great book, and the scientific references are not bad either (most natural remedy-based books have either no references or unreputable references). I especially liked her section on the role of histamine in mental disorders. Histamine plays a much larger role in mental illness than the conventional doctors currently think. For example, only 20-25% of Americans have allergies, yet 85% of depressed patients have allergies---a four-fold difference, and very statistically significant. Histamine may also contribute to anxiety and ADD. This is elaborated in my new book, The Failures of American Medicine.	2002-10-10

All of the other books that I have reviewed, I have had to \\"talk down\\" to the lay-reader and try to explain in common sense terms why the book is good or bad. Now with this book (overpriced as it is), I finally can write a real scientific review. This book is very good, for what it is---the 5HT-2A signal transduction pathway. Yes, this is probably the main pathway that causes depression (besides HPA axis disregulation, although the 2A pathway is involved with HPA anyway). And it's also the main pathway that helps a person taking SSRI's overcome depression. <br /> It explains that the 2A pathway shunts over to the noradrenaline (NA) pathway, thus providing energy and neuronal remodeling and dendrite regrowth. This is a discovery that had previously stumped researchers, because they realized that the 5HT and NA pathways must be interconnected, but they didn't know how they were. However, I think that this book brings to light an even more interesting discovery---patients with severe, suicidal depression have elevated intracellular calcium levels. Not only does the 2A pathway shunt over to the NA pathway, it also funnels into the \\"calcium\\" pathway, a complex and often redundant pathway that controls many different cellular functions, including muscle contraction. I believe that somehow the calcium pathway becomes dominant over the NA shunt, and (again, besides HPA axis disregulation) that's why patients become depressed. And certain calcium channel blockers (ex. Nimodopine) can act as antidepressants! Much more research is needed into the calcium field of brain research. The calcium pathway may also be involved in SSRI side effects, since this pathway may be stimulated in some patients, making things potentially worse, or possibly explaining why these patients are treatment-resistant. I have a chapter on this phenomenon in my book, if you care to readabout it.	2002-10-10

Unfortunately, I was only interested in about 25% of the book's contents---those dealing with mental illness. Maybe I should have bought Neurology for Psychiatrists, but that book is smaller, so this one probably has almost as much psychiatric information anyway. Unlike many of the other reviewers, I actually LIKE the amount of detail in this book, although since I don't have an M.D. or a Ph.D. I could not understand all of it. I did also notice from the other reviews that there is a demand for a for user-friendly book dealing with Neurology, that parents can read to help understand their child's neurological deficits. Well, I have the solution! My book, The Failures of American Medicine (available at Amazon for [price]), contains five chapters on mental illness, and is both technical and relatively easy to read.

However, lately I use it simply to look up symptoms, and not necessarily for nutritional advice. This is because some of the nutritional advice goes a bit overboard. I have no problems with people taking megadoses of vitamins (except B6). The problem I do have with certain parts of this book is the Authors' recommendations to take large amounts of minerals. A person can take 10, 100, or even 1000 times the U.S. R.D.A. of most vitamins and be fine. But if a person takes only 2-5 times the R.D.A. of certain minerals (ex. potassium, chromium, selenium, magnesium, manganese, zinc), they can suffer adverse reactions that more than cancel out any positive effect that the mineral may give. Some of the recommendations for minerals in this book are simply too high for the dosage. Also, they seem to recommend herbs along with vitamins and minerals without always checking to see if there have been documented interactions in the past between an herb and a vitamin/mineral. The public needs to realize that most herbs have many different active ingredients that can interact with many other ingested substances, especially pharmaceutical drugs, but not excluding vitamins and minerals. Some of these interactions are found in my book, The Failures of American Medicine, available at Amazon...	2002-10-07

However, in the last year I personally have noticed that Black doesn't have to play certain moves after White does. In other words, the opening White chooses does not necessarily \\"force\\" Black to choose the \\"appropriate\\" defense.  Also, even if Black plays a certain defense according to what White opens with, White can still obliterate Blacks middlegame defensive plans, often with just one move! For example, in the Benoni defense, Black wants the pawn structure to be his pawns at d4 and c5, with a White pawn cradled in d5. This is advantageous for Black, not for White. After Black plays c5, in one move White can commit the cardinal sin of trading a center pawn for a side pawn (d4xc5), but that completely wipes out the Benoni! Most defenses can be negated this way, and if the Black player is not an expert, he will be lost as to what to do. <br />So, for intermediate players of up to 1800 ranking like me, what do we do when we play Black? Do we passively mirror White's opening with the \\"correct\\" defense? Do we act like a monkey waiting for the master's next move? No, I say! We initiate counterplay on the kingside! Everyone knows that an open center is very dangerous for Black, since White has the first move and therefore the initiative. Only expert players can have a winning record playing Black with an open center. The lower the ranking, the worse the player tends to do playing Black with an open center. The Benoni partially closes the center, but like I described above, it can be negated easily. A better defense is the King's Indian Defense, of which several pages in NCO is dedicated. This closes up the center nicely, but kingside counterplay by Black is inhibited by the knight residing on f6. Why not move the knight to e7? Then later after castling kingside, an f6-f5 pawn advance can be prepared. I firmly believe that the most important square in the game FOR BOTH SIDES is e5. Whoever controls e5 will usuallywin the game. If Black controls e5 by first preparing f6 e6 d6, then e5, White cannot control e5 if his knight is on f3, since he cannot advance his f pawn to f4 to help his center pawns. After that, Black can take his time moving major pieces to the kingside. Supposedly its a huge mistake to develop pawns before pieces. But if the center is closed, White's pieces outside the pawn chain become a liability, not an asset. Try this variation of the KID...you may be surprised by the results.	2001-08-09

His holistic approach is important, especially his advice to get aerobic exercise daily. Again, if the AVERAGE moderately depressed person follows this program, they should see significant improvement, along with taking an antidepressant, of course. But not everyone will benefit, as you have read from some of the other reviews. Even taking an antidepressant, exercising, eating right, taking supplements and having a \\"spiritual\\" connection (religion, meditation, etc.) will not be enough for some people (up to 30% of those depressed). This is because there are other problems besides serotonin deficiency in depression. Anxiety may be worsened by antidepressants, and many mood disorders may be caused by a Histamine imbalance (in fact, two-thirds of Schizophrenics have a Histamine imbalance). If you still have anxiety after taking an antidepressant, lower the dose! (and try Buspar, then Ativan). And get your histamine level checked by an Endocrinologist.

Uneducated! When I heard my roommate's girlfriend was on them, I thought &quot;gee, she is screwed up, and they don't help her much&quot;. When I found out two people at work were on them, with their stone-like, expressionless faces, I thought &quot;I'll never try them, because I don't want to be like them&quot;. But I didn't have a choice. Why? Because as I found out later (un?)fortunately during my high anxiety period, that depression runs strong in my family. My grandmother is on antidepressants, my aunt is on sedatives, and my father is on both antidepressants and sedatives. When I found out HE was on them, I knew I had no choice but to see a Psychiatrist. The first two things students learn in Psychology is than behavior is a combination of environmental and genetic influences. Anxiety and depression can stem from a million different reasons and you can't figure out all of them. But you CAN figure out if your anxiety/depression is genetically based, by talking to your blood relatives about it. Ask them if they have had any of the same symptoms you have, or if your lucky, they will tell you what medication they are on. If you are even luckier, you will not have a family history of depression. Then you can be very optimistic that psychiatric medications can be temporary. But, I'm very sorry to say this---if you have a family history of suicide/alcoholism/depression, then you don't have a choice. It's like diabetes---are you going to treat it, or are you going to let it slowly kill you? You do have one choice---you can be your own worst enemy or your own best friend.

B-complex helps restore normal metabolism, including production of serotonin. Vitamin C does all kinds of things in the brain, including having antipsychotic activity (inhibition of activated dopamine adenylate cyclase), antihistamine activity (histamine is much more involved in mental illness than most doctor's currently realize), and prevention of neurotransmitter oxidation. Vitamin E has a mild antidepressant effect, possibly because of increasing blood flow inside the brain. These items listed above are detailed in another book, the Failures of American Medicine, available here at Amazon.	2000-10-20

Books	1	34	69	N	N	Unscientific anecdotes that &quot;hypothesize everything&quot;	Well, I have 1000 words to work with, and I will use all of them. As of May, 2000, I am the first person to give this book a 1 star rating. I guess I'm a stick-in-the-mud. But read on. The information I will give to you is  just as valuable as in the book, and 90% of it FACTUALLY contradicts the  book! First of all, you have to realize that &quot;Dr. Tracy&quot; is a  Psychologist, not a Psychiatrist, and has no formal medical training.  Everything she knows is from reading, not hands-on clinical interactions  with the patients on SSRI's. Second, she proves the theory that Psychology  is not a real science! Let me explain to you the difference between  Psychology (a social science) and Biology/Medicine (a physical science).  Social science is all statistical, and the allowed statistical variation is  twice that of Biology, and ten times that of Medicine. That leaves the  Psychology researcher free to &quot;massage&quot;, or fit the data any way  they want. And that's exactly what Dr. Tracy does. In fact, she fits the  data so horribly it could never even be publishable in the most mediocre  journal! For example, she writes that there are more adverse reactions to  Prozac and the other SSRI's than all other psychotropic drugs. Well, if 100  TIMES as many people are TAKING THE SSRI's, then of course there will be  more people with side effects from the SSRI's! She conveniently leaves out  the &quot;Side effects per person&quot; numbers, just to prove her  &quot;points&quot;. And I agree with the other reviewer about her spelling.  She doesn't even spell Xanax right (she spells it Xanex). So, by now, you  may be asking what MY qualifications are...I have an M.S. in Biology, which  is a heck of a lot better in understanding Pharmacology than a Ph.D. in  Psychology. I agree with her that pharmaceutical drugs are dangerous, and I  know as well as any other person that the pharmaceutical companies have a  stranglehold on medicine. But SSRI's have helped 25 MILLION people in this  country. And how dangerous are they really? You'd be suprised to know how  SAFE they really are compared to some very common over-the-counter drugs. I  have a drug book at home, and it lists the side-effects as either  non-lethal or lethal. Prozac (alone) does have one lethal side-effect:  Seizures. Paxil and Zoloft (again, alone and not in combination with  MAOI's) do not have ANY lethal side-effects. They are VERY SAFE! Compared  to what, you ask? How about Aspirin, a drug you all know. Aspirin (and  Ibuprofen) can be lethal to people allergic to it (I should know---I  suffered asthma with Motrin). I don't know how many people have died from  Aspirin/Ibuprofen, but it's probably in the thousands to hundreds of  thousands. TWO people have died from Zoloft, and they took roughly 200  tablets to deliberately overdose. Even Tylenol, the safest  anti-inflammatory drug, can be lethal at a 30-60 pill overdose. Zoloft is  MUCH safer than Aspirin and Tylenol!  If you don't believe me, ask a  pharmacist to look up these drugs. Look, nobody WANTS to take the SSRI  drugs, but the ironic thing about the book is that the symptoms Dr. Tracy  says the SSRI's should cause are the very same ones that are ALLEVIATED by  the SSRI's! Her theories are just that---theories. The reality is that  20-30% of patients do not like the side effects of SSRI's, and stop  treatment, and the rest do fine, and have much improved lives (like me). I  have a hereditary Serotonin deficiency, and Zoloft supplements my Serotonin  levels. Is that so bad?	2000-05-14
