Her familiarity with aspects of the medical profession is very obvious, and she makes the reader feel like an insider, too. 'Harvest' is a fairly standard mystery novel set in an unusual environment, and well-written -- I had trouble putting it down. The predicament of the heroine at the denouement is truly horrifying. I give 'Harvest' 4 out of 5 stars (not 5 because parts are a wee bit too predictable) and rate it 'PG.'	2003-04-18

I had been looking forward to it ever since he told me about it a couple of years ago. As I expected, it was an engrossing read and well worth the wait. The social, moral, and ethical issues were laid out in Brin's typically masterful style. The only thing that kept this book from being a clear 100% winner for me was the swerve into metaphysics near the end -- but that's just me.<br />A very thought-provoking and entertaining book; highly recommended and with a PG rating.	2003-03-05
US	52168044	RFW35QFNJ6HDN	076530094X	775257603	GermLine	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Excellent medical s-f thriller	I was offered the opportunity to read a galley of this book before it went into print, and I can say without reservation that I was not disappointed. There are several concurrent plots (pun intended), and the third-person narration shifts from one to the next very smoothly. There's an Andromeda Strain quality of inexorability and gathering velocity as more pieces of the puzzle fall into place for the reader, leading to a not entirely predictable climax. As with so many things, there is no one clear solution to the moral and ethical questions posed by the book, and the ending leaves some tempting teasers lying about for the reader to sieze and worry at if so inclined. It is clearly a story of how one set of (fictional) people reacted to the dilemmas, and I found it difficult not to keep asking myself, 'How would I have reacted?' The necessary explanations of the highly-technical processes and jargon peculiar to genetic research were on the whole handled very well; there was no sense of being 'talked down to' although I think some of the explanations could have been a bit clearer than they were. On the whole, I found the topic intriguing, the treatment thought-provoking, and the style and presentation very good. I give GermLine four stars out of five, and a rating of PG due to some of the fairly graphic descriptions.	2003-03-05

This is a very gripping story, and well worth the read.  I give it 5.0 stars for the writing and drama, and 4.75 stars for the science fiction.  (There are a couple of issues I found the tiniest bit unacceptable.)  I'd rate this 'PG' because of some of the graphic descriptions, but otherwise 'G' for 'Great.'	2000-12-22

Limberg was thinking  of a different book when writing the last review.  There are at least two  books that might have prompted it: one is essentially a copy of the source  code ('Apache Server Commentary'), and the other is a copy of the  documentation on the Web site (I have a copy, but can't remember the  title).  I can assure you that 'Apache Server Unleashed' is neither of  these; it contains hundreds of pages of technical custom-written text that  appear nowhere else.  I know, because I wrote a bunch of it. :-)<br />BTW, the  5-star rating I've given is because I have to give *some* rating, and to  offset the single star from what I sincerely believe is a mistaken review.	2000-08-12

I think some of his predicted technological advances --  including the one key to the entire book -- are on shaky scientific ground,  but it's a good thought-provoking book if you can suspend disbelief. And  who knows? Maybe it's not so shaky as I believe. Your forehead should be  furrowed when you finish reading it.<br />Warning: I consider this to be a  'PG' rated book. Not because of any sexual situations (what there are of  such are handled tastefully and obliquely), but because I think some of the  sociopolitical predictions and depictions could be a little disturbing.	2000-06-19

Yes,  suddenly you're a dragon: big, strong, able to fly, with a craving for gold  and a reputation for being.. well, slow.

It seems I like Anthony's work less  and less with each new title he writes -- I find his characters' thoughts  too dialogue-ish, overbearing, and belabouring of the obvious -- but I  still enjoy this title a lot despite a couple of logical  inconsistencies.<br />Warning: Though this book contains nothing explicit,  some of the themes are definitely adult in nature.

Good, yes, but not great. Perhaps it's  because Anthony manages to mix two distinct technological and magical  milieux in a single story, or because one of the principal characters is an  unicorn. I'm not sure, but I still like it.  The culture on Proton is  pretty bizarre, but understandable and funny once you accept the basic  tenets.

All of the characters come to life and are eminently believable.  The information that alarms them should certainly alarm us (if true, and I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if  it were).  Tension builds steadily and quite satisfactorily until the  denouement.  The main character's unshakeable integrity and implacability  had me cheering for him every step of the way.

I should have been so lucky as to have had such experiences when I was at University. Elves, magic, librarians, bullies, and an irrepressiblly  good-natured college student make for an highly enjoyable romp through  might-have-been. (Or perhaps &quot;might-be&quot; if there's any justice in  the world.) There are at least two sequels in the 'Mythology' universe,  'Mythology Abroad,' and (I think) 'Higher Mythology.' I highly recommend  this title, 'Mythology 101,' for light reading when you need something  cheery and humourous.<br />  Definitely rated 'G.'	2000-06-07

This has been one of my favourites ever since my sister gave it to me on my 11th birthday and introduced me to Thurber's delightful sideways view of the world.

This story is set in what could be ourfuture -- and not so far off, at that -- and the picture painted is really quite bleak. If you've seen the motion picture 'Bladerunner,' you'll find familiar the dark mood and casual acceptance of advanced technology used for mundane things. Like most of his other works, I find Neuromancer to be gripping but a little disturbing and depressing. This is serious reading, not something I'd recommend for filling a sunny idle afternoon.<br />Warning: I'd give this book a 'PG' rating because of the disturbing themes, language, and some sexual situations.	2000-06-07

It's a very entertaining story about a technologically advanced traveller's visit to a fairly primitive world, narrated by one of the  primitives. It's an hilarious treatment of Clarke's Law in action, and a  colossal pun near the end will delight long-time SF readers enormously.<br />  This is definitely a  'G'-rated title in my book.	2000-06-07

Also one of the earliest books of which I know dealing with artificial  intelligence and social responsibility. A good, fun read for adults, but  not one I'd suggest trying to &quot;whip off&quot; in an afternoon.

Daley describes a fairly distant future in which I wouldn't mind  living, complete with aliens, ray-guns,  Galactic gypsies, flying bicycles, starships,  automatic taxidermy machines, villains, heroes, and  True Love. The main characters  are a mousy little bureaucrat from isolationist Earth and a chaotic  and flamboyant ABS  (Able-Bodied Starman). Just good fun; very hard to put down.

However, this is that rare thing: a  trilogy conclusion that really concludes the story. It's an happy ending,  no fear -- and it leaves you feeling good and fulfilled, so there's no need  for Duncan to write more. (It *could* be done, of course, as McCaffrey did  with 'Nerilka's Story,' but it isn't a foregone conclusion that it will be  -- or even should be.) Excellent reading; a real page-turner.<br />  This one's rated 'G' by me.	2000-06-07

The prose is very descriptive and evocative without being flowery or  tedious (a very difficult tightrope to walk), the characters quickly  develop depth and personalities, and it is very, very easy to suspend  disbelief and immerse yourself in the story. The ending prepares you for  the next book without really being a cliff-hanger. Sword and sorcery, sort  of -- with a twist. Does Clarke's Law explain everything? You decide..<br />  I'd rate this 'G.'	2000-06-07

Usually, though, their duties are pretty simple and short-lived, and it's what they do for a living. This is an interesting story told first-person  about a situation in which nothing is normal and none of the usual  conditions apply. Heinlein takes the opportunity to insert some sly  governmental criticism. Nothing about the story is really inevitable, but  it appears that way when looking back on it. <br />                                                    Definitely a 'G' rating for this.	2000-06-07

It continues the chronicle  of the madcap adventures of this odd couple, in the same fast-paced,  free-wheeling, and thoroughly enjoyable style as the first two. It, too,  can stand on its own -- but is more enjoyable if one is steeped in the  wonder and hilarious hysteria of the preceding titles. I consider it a  significant tragedy that Brian Daley died of cancer in 1996 before he could  continue the stories (if such was indeed his intention). Requiescat en  pace, mon ami.<br />  'G'-rated according to me. I consider the content of this book to be  suitable reading for all ages.	2000-06-07

Some of the phrasing is a little odd, I get a sense that Hubbard was fumbling a bit as he tried to tell the story, and a few of the scientific  issues I find somewhat suspect, but it's still a good read though quite  long. In some ways it's like a moderately good mystery: you can see as each  major crux is reached that you had the necessary information to deduce it.  I think this is best read in installments; you're likely to get severe  mental indigestion if you try to read it without any breaks.<br />  Definitely a 'G' rating. Not only  are there no sexual situations, but even the violence inherent in genocide  is treated distantly and with no gory particulars.	2000-06-07

It can stand on its own for fun reading, because the style remains the same,  but the series really should be read in sequence to get the full effect --  it's an epic, not a collection of semi-related vignettes. Whatever.. If you  read 'Reluctant' first, you won't need an invitation to read 'Wisdom. '<br />  I'd give this a 'G'  rating.	2000-06-07

Ghosts, time travel,  goblins, færie, dragons, politics, aliens, Neanderthals -- all intermix  here on an University campus. This is another one of those books that draws  you in and makes you feel welcome and part of the action. While not  necessarily faithful to legend and myth, it's still grand tale.<br />  Good for all ages; I'd say it's  rated 'G.'	2000-06-07

I think Chalker wrote this as a stand-alone story, but it has grown  several sequels (like warts) that might be viewed as detracting from this  one. Taken on its own merits, though, 'Midnight at the Well of Souls' is a  fun tale with a novel explanation for the existence of Existence.<br />  Warning: Though this book  contains nothing explicit, some of the themes are definitely adult in  nature.

Our hero, fresh out of a non-war in Southeast Asia, gets co-opted into an otherworld quest for the most fabulous object in the universe -- which has been stolen by the  nogoodniks, of course. When he wrote this, Heinlein merged some of the  aspects of his juvenile books (in which the goals are clear-cut and there  are few grey areas), with those of some of his later works, which feature  more moral dilemmas and a lot of attention paid to the Barnyard Dance.<br />  Warning: I think Heinlein  was just beginning to head down his 'free-love' path when he wrote this  book, so I'd give this a 'PG' rating.	2000-06-07

When the peaceful world of Pacifica is subjected to 'missions' from the rabid Femocrats of  Earth and the male-dominated Transcendental Scientists, both intent upon  converting Pacifica to their own viewpoints, it's a real challenge to the  citizens and the government. Public opinion is moulded through the media,  and Pacifica prides itself on being the most media-savvy and sophisticated  world in the human Galaxy. Only now the Pacificans' own 'First Amendment'  type laws are being used against them..<br />Frequently graphic, occasionally  disturbing, and always enjoyable.<br />  Warning: This book contains some explicit passages that are  definitely adult in nature.

The plot develops with rigourous precision and inexorable realism; there's nothing Brin depicts that would be unreasonable should a global A-B-C war actually engulf the world  to-morrow. Scary in its plausibility, and heartening because of its  hopefulness, this is a wonderful book.<br />  Warning: I'd call this a 'PG-13' book, primarily because  of some of the violence.	2000-06-07

Book 1 of The Adventures of Conrad Stargard<br />Yet another displacement story, and the first of a moderately long series, 'The Cross-Time Engineer' is very plausible and is told first-person by the protagonist. Frankowski has done a very good job (IMHO) of depicting the attitudes and prejudices of an educated young man from the end of the XXth century. More, his work instilled in me a lot of respect for the Polish people, and a tiny yearning to learn Polish. Once you accept the basic premise of someone being cast back in time, your suspension of disbelief won't be disturbed by the hero pulling fantastical solutions out of his hat. He suffers discomfort (and comfort!) and gets confused and makes mistakes like everyone else. Each book in this series can stand on its own, though it becomes more and more difficult toward the end.<br /> I'd give this a 'G' rating despite the frequent (but non-explicit) sexual references. They're treated tastefully enough for younger readers, I think, although the book wouldn't suffer if there were fewer of them. (MHO.)	2000-06-07

A collection of chronologically-ordered stories from the life of a single de Camp character, Willie Newbury, banker and unwilling focus of occult forces.

The companions in  misfortune that were introduced in Requiem continue their adventures  through dens of techno-cannibals, lairs of scum and villainy, abject  poverty, fabulous wealth, battles with clone librarians, negociations with  juvenile gangs, and intoxicated funerals for varnished aliens. Every bit as  good as Requiem.<br />  Like  the previous book in the series ('Requiem for a Ruler of Worlds'), I rate  this one 'G.'

(Fortunately it's light reading and I'm a fast reader.)  Our conclusions  were the same: it certainly *is* suitable for children, and adults as well.  It's fun, light, and describes the activities of a schoolboy trying to be  good (probably harder than most real schoolboys).  Personally, I saw no  hint of any of the darker aspects I've heard ascribed to it; I rather  suspect the ascribers hadn't read it, but were jerking their knees over  'hot-button' words like 'magic' and 'sorcery.'  I wouldn't hesitate to  recommend this book to *anyone*, of any age.	2000-05-24

I have bought several others on the strength of my appreciation for Shogun alone, though they have almost all earned similar  kudos.  The story is incredibly detailed; the threads and points of view  disparate but handled with fantastic finesse and attention to interlocking  them into each other; and the ending a surprise (to me at least), but with  a feeling of massive inexorability about it that provides fulfillment and  complete closure.  If you're looking for good, absorbing, exciting, and  entertaining literature with which you can settle down for several hours,  and are willing to have your eyes opened by one of the best introductions  I've ever encountered to a truly non-Western culture, please give this book  a try.	2000-05-19

I purchased it primarily so that I could understand what the JavaScript I saw in Web page sources was doing; for that purpose, this book was quite  adequate.  Even though the ...for Dummies books aren't intended to be read  serially from front to back, I found doing so a big help in getting the  most I could out of this book.  Since I got out of it what I wanted, my  main complaint is the description and use of non-standard HTML elements  (such as the 'layer' tag) without noting their non-standardness, and  failing to tag documents using advanced (i.e., HTML 4) features with the  appropriate DOCTYPE tag.  This can lead to documents that don't comply with  the HTML specifications.	2000-05-05

It needs to be approached with a willingness to be thoughtful, ponder events, and retain lots of elements in memory as you read.  If you try to read it too quickly, you're probably  going to have to read it at least once more to pick up the bits you missed  -- and it's well worth a second read, or a third, or ..., even if you took  your time. This is Science Fiction, not space opera, and it focusses on  personal and societal response to change imposed from without, rather than  the razzle-dazzle glitz of Clarke's Law technology. (Of course, I'm a big  Zelazny fan.. :-)	2000-05-04
US	52168044	R2F3JSNLLGRG5H	1565922220	30873774	sendmail (Nutshell Handbook)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Excellent reference, though with some assumptions	I bought this book because I needed to learn about anti-spam measures using sendmail features the 1st edition didn't cover.  While the book wasn't as detailed in those areas as I'd like, it certainly provided me  with enough info to accomplish what I needed to do, and has been an  excellent reference for basic sendmail questions I've had since.  It *has*  to be a pretty good book if it helped someone with essentially no sendmail  experience at all set up anti-spam stuff!	2000-04-21

I picked up the book in an airport just for old times' sake, and was more than pleasantly surprised.  The technology is believable, the situations and conflicts well-described, the flow from scene to scene is smooth, scene changes don't leave you  teetering and feeling dissatisfied, and the character development is quite  good.  While Shatner's Tek novels clearly show the influence of his mentor  (Ron Goulart), Doohan has outdone him in establishing a unique 'voice.'  Stirling's expertise at depicting elements of conflict meshes  indistinguishably. If you're an SF reader, and/or a Trekkie, this book is  outstanding and well worth it.  It stands well alone, so you needn't get  the next in the series to achieve a sense of closure.	2000-04-19

The character portrayals, and development, are excellent; the societal predictions absolutely, frighteningly, believable. Better by far than &quot;Alas, Babylon&quot;, in addition to being terrific SF this counts as  the best 'end of the world' story I've ever read.  I've read it so many  times the original copy wore out.	2000-04-19

While the action kept me turning the pages, and the details kept things interesting, I would have liked more character development and plot twists.  There's just a little  too much predictability about the Big Picture here.  But for an afternoon's  read, this is quite enjoyable.	2000-04-19
US	52168044	RIPEVYII6GFC7	0911682120	879160899	Heinlein in Dimension, a Critical Analysis.	Books	3	26	27	N	Y	The good, the bad, and .. you decide	I waited a long time before deciding to to buy and read this book.  Heinlein was the author of the first SF I ever read; I didn't read anything by Panshin until twenty years later.  However, I like them both, in  different ways and for different reasons.  While I cannot say I agree with  all of the observations, criticisms, and conclusions Panshin has made about  Heinlein -- I don't -- &quot;Heinlein in Dimension&quot; *did* make me  think a bit more about the Heinlein I've read. Seeing how Panshin viewed  him and his work has made me consider my own opinions on the matter. If  you're looking for an RAH cheerleading book, this isn't it.  If you're  looking for a completely objective and unbiased book about Heinlein and his  work, I don't think this is it either.  If, however, you're familiar with  Heinlein (even a fan), are looking for someone *trying* to be objective  about the subject, and can read it with the continual remembrance that  you're reading someone's *opinion*, then you might find &quot;Heinlein in  Dimension&quot; worthwhile -- in viewpoint-stretching ways if not as pure  analysis.	2000-04-09

Thought-provoking but not too much so, with reasonably fast-paced action and moderate depth.	2000-03-23

They look at the world in a wacky way that is nevertheless perfectly reasonable.  This one, the second in the series  (which regrettably never got beyond the third volume), is as excellent as  the other two.  If you can find a copy in your local public library, you  should check it out.  If you can find a copy for sale, you should  definitely buy it -- unless fun reading isn't your cup of tea.	2000-03-23

I particularly appreciate the way in which it makes the mod_perl Apache module clearly and easily  accessible despite its complexity.	1999-04-24
