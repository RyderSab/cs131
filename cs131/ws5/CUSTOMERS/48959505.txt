Each one starts \\"You Might be a Redneck if\\" followed by the punchline. there are many old ones such as \\"Your satelite dish has more square footage than your home\\". and new ones such as \\"you work on your car when there is nothing wrong with it\\". There is no illustrations as in the books. This does make it practicle for writting information on the calendar. The day  and date is in the lower right hand corner, Special Days on the left. Some of the jokes are funny, some are not so funny. It would be hard to come up with 300 different \\"You might be a redneck\\" jokes for the entire year.	2003-12-03

Even with all of our failings God's love for us is unconditional. God's lover is so strong that he sent Jesus to pay the price for our sins. All we need it faith if Christ. Membership in God's holy family cannot be revolked. God's accepts use and makes us presentible through Jesus. I had a pastor that once said \\"God sees us through Jesus colored glasses\\". Manning does not imply that we should ignore sin. Sin interferes with our enjoyment as members of God's family. As the author of Hebrews states, We cannot run the race if we are hindered in anyway (paraphrase). Sin hinders our race and has a negative effect of our enjoyment of God's family and love.	2003-12-02

She is orphaned during an earthquake as a child. When she is attacked by a lion she is found nearly dead by a clan of Neanderthals. She is nursed back to health and is adopted by the clans medicine woman. <br />Clan of the Cave Bear ( as well as the future books in the series )is thoroughly researched). The story is based on actual archealogical findings. The character Creb is a medicine man who has severe physical deformities. An actual neanderthal skeleton was discovered that apears to have the same deformaties that Creb has. The story is fictionalized but it is amazing how they cancreate a culture based on a few artifacts. Since there is no written record, \\"Clan of the Cave Bear \\" is as close to an actual ethnography of early modern humans as you can get.	2003-09-01

There is also an actor, director and cinemotograoher section. since the book is comprehsive it is quite large and expensive. I recomend the Leonard Maltin Book.

He states eventhough our salvation is sealed by the blood of Jesus, our reward is is based on our works on earth. Erwin Luttzer makes aprofound statement in that what we recieve from God is solely out of the generosity of his goodness. We recieve because God gives it to us not because we deserve it. Our reward or participation in Heaven is based on our works and deeds on earth. We enter Heaven under general admission through faith in the death and resurection of Jesus. Weither or not we sit behind the dugout or on the fifty yard line is up to us. Erwin Lutzer states that Jesus is looking for servants that serve him and one another willingly. Every good deed done in the name of Jesus is tallied in Heaven. He also states that not all deads have pure motives, but if we generally have hearts for Jesus we will be rewarded. He also states that everything belongs to God, even money. How we treat what God has given us will also effect our Judgement and rewards in heaven. In general, how we live on earth as believers will effect our position in Heaven.	2003-06-26

The book centers around a young worm who does not like being a worm. His father tells him a story about a human named Harriet who loved nature. But, loving nature is different from understanding nature. What we see as being bad in nature,in reality, serves a good useful purpose and what we see as being good can really be negative. Plus, our ignorance of nature can be harmful, like when Harriet threw a tortoise into the water thinking it was a turtle. The father worm explains to his son that all things in nature has a purpose.<br />The book is funny and witty with Gary Larson's wierd sence of humor. The drawings will be familiar to anyone who has read the Far Side. This book can be a useful tool for teachers to introduce their students to how nature works. This book could be use as part of an introductory lesson for a unit on ecology.	2003-02-22

He apparently blames himself for the death of his oldre brother in a boating accident. His mother is distant and is unable to communicate to her son.<br />This book addresses an important theme in that people tend to put on a false front to the world. We all like to have people think our world is perfect. We like to hide the inperfections of our lives around this shiny ball we show to the world. When that ball starts to crack we desperately try to cover up the rot that is inside. That is the basic story in this book (and the movie version as well). Conrad's mother whants everyone to think her world is perfect. Then her son dies in a tragic accident. This is a tragedy that can, unfortunatley happen to anyone. But to Conrad's mother this is a tragedy that brings negative attention to her perfect world. Intead of dealing with it she tries to cover it up and hide her feelings, especially toward her young son Conrad. He then tries to commit suicide. This further shows the world that things are not right. Her son is sent to a psychiatrist. Conrad has a person to listen to his hurt. His mother does not want to discuss or admit is pain even exists. To discuss the hurt and pain, is to admit that things are not perfect. To Conrad's mother her perfect world is begining to shatter as the perfect little ball she shows the world begins to crack.	2003-01-29

During the Next Generation series the original Kahless was cloned by some Klingon clerics by using his DNA. The cloned Kahless was made a figurehead emperor. Michael Jan Friedman novel is about this Kahless. Apparently a Klingon cleric has found a scroll that reveals that the legend of Kahless is not what everyone assumed it to be. Instead of being a great warrior he was a man pushed into a situation beyond his control. The validity of the restored emperor becomes suspect. This threatens to throw the Klingon empire into a civil war (WHAT ELSE IS NEW !! ). <br /> The story goes back and forth between the present and the time of the original Kahless. Of course Lt. Worf is at the center of the controversy. He was appointed to analyze the documents ( a copy was sent to him on the Enterprise). The documents were found to be authentic. The real Kahless wrote and left the documents in order to clarify the legend that was growing about him.<br /> This book is one of the better Star Trek novels. Michael Jan Friedman is probably the best Star Trek author. He does an excellent job in describing (or better yet creating) Klingon culture, especially ancient Klingon culture that is not described in any of the Star Trek series or movies.	2003-01-25

People who criticize him do not want to hear that their sins are just as repulsive to God as homosexuality. Dr. Campolo talks about other subjects such as women ministers,public schools, should Christians kill, and is it OK to be rich?<br />As far as homosexuality and AIDS. Dr. Campolo states that homosexualility is no worse than any other sin, especially the sin of adultery. To say AIDS is a special punishment from God for homosexuality disgraces the character of God. As Tony Campolo says if God uses illness to punish sin then we will ALL be in the hospital. Dr. Campolo urges Christians to reach out to the homosexual community and the people with AIDS with love.<br />Another topic was women ministers. He felt it was hypocritical to allow women to be ministers over seas but deny them the right to be ordained ministers in this country. Dr. Campolo states that there are many women with very strong ministries. DR. Campolo states that the passasge in scripture in which Paul says women should be quite in church was a reference to women who would use the church to speak out against their husbands. Also, Greco-Roman society was highly male dominate, therefore having women ministers may prevent people from joining the church. This is not the situation today.<br />Another controversial issue is pulling the plug on terminally ill patients. Dr.Compolo staes that it wrong to keep the body alive my artificial means. One such case are people that are declared brain dead. When the brain stops functioning the body stops functioning.These people are only kept alive by machines. Another case are people who are only kept alive by machines that are fully conscious. Dr. Campolo tells of a wife of a friend who had a disease that made some of her vital organs inoperative. She was in extreme pain and the pain medicine was not working. Without modern medicine she would have died anyway. He is not saying modern medicine is bad, but if these machines are the only thing that is keeping people alive,who are in extreme pain, at a great expense then these machines should be turned off and let nature take its course. He does not condone mercy killing or euthanasia. Dr. campolo is saying that when the body ceases to function naturally and the body is kept alive artificially then the patient and the patient's family has the right to turn of the machines. <br />I agree with Tony Campolo. Conservative Christians do not like to hear that they are equal sinners to homosexuals. Their sin is also mentioned in the Bible and is equally offensive to God. Tony Campolo is asking people to reach out to others with love and without judgement.	2003-01-02

When hitler came to power Germany was in economic chaos and the people in despair. HItler promised to restore Germany to it's former greatness. <br /> When Hitler came to power he began to dismantle the Christian church and replace it with the nationalistic German church. The cross was replaced by the swatiska and the bible was replaced by Hitler's Mien Kampf. The German church preached complete obedience to the national leadership. Hitler then started his policy of \\"racial purity\\" Believed Germany will return to its greatness if it return to its Aryan roots. This was the begining of the extermination of the Jews.<br /> There were Christians that did stand up to Hitler. Two of these was Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Martin Niemoller. They formed the resistence church called the cofession church. They preached that the cross must be supreme and be above all symbols.<br /> Lutzer explains that the hollicaust was God's opportunity to strengthen and purify his church. In the presents of this great evil many christians willingly laid down their lives to oppose Hitler and to save the Jews. Lutzer explains that when the cross is removed the full force of human evil is released. I believe the hollicaust shows that when God is removed there is nothing to stop evil. Many secular humanists believe that good can come from man and we do not need God. The events of WWII prove otherwise. Lutzer explains that the removal of christ with nationalism dates back to 19th century German philosophy. Georg Hegal taught that the national state must be supreme and Fredrick Nietzche taught that Christianity was weak and that God was dead.<br /> Erwin Lutzer makes strong parellels to this country. He compares the plight of the Jews during the hollicaust to the plight of unborn babies under abortion. He states that the secular world is trying to purge Christianity from the public sector. Today people are getting into trouble in work and school for professing their beliefs. This book was written before the tragedy of Columbine. I feel that a lot of the school violence is due to the fact that Jesus was removed from our public schools. Lutzer states thate The United States is marching down the same road that that NAZI germany did by having the voice of the church supressed by the national government. But, on the other hand Christian fundamentalists are using the same tactics. They are trying to force the country to follow their brand of Christianity and their own personal political agenda. Homosexuals and anyone else who is contrary to the Christian right are being treated the same way that Hitler treated the Jews. I have no problem with Homosexuals adopting children. It is better that a child be in a loving environment then be in an abussive environment. I believe in personal acountability. I am only accountable to God for my self not anybody else. When I hear \\"so called\\" Christians saying \\"God hates homosexuals and that its a sign of Gods perfect hate\\" I have a hard time <BR>following the conservative christian position on Homosexuality.<br /> Erwin Lutzer states that \\"The Cross reminds us that the battle is not so much between church and state as it is between within our own hearts. If Christ has all of us, if The Cross stands above politics and the world as Bonhoeffer has reminded us, we shall overcome regardless of the cost.\\" Pg.207	2002-12-28

Everest Disaster	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Very powerful book	John Krakauer gives a harrowing description of one of the most tragic climbs in Mt. Everest history. John Krackhauer gives explicit details about the sport of mountain climbing and the experience of climbing Everest. While reading this book I came to realized that there were people on this climb that should not have been there in the first place. It was like who ever had the money could climb Everest. Many people put down almost $60,000 dollars to partake in a guided expedition. John Krakauer was doing the climb for an article in \\"Outside\\" magazine. The guide that he went with wanted him for the publicity. Eventhough these guides ask for a large amount of money, they where trained professionals who did not do anything delibrately to jeopardize the safety of their clients. But, even with skilled guides a lot is dependant on the skills of the indivisual climbers. One climber did not know how to put on her cramptions (specialized cleats for ice climbing) properly. One client was a young female socialite who was only out for adventure. This climb was sad story of selfishness. One leader refused to loan his radio in order to contact the lost climbers. John Krakauer described climbing Everest as an extremely physical and mental challange in which the climbers push themselves to the brink of physical endurance. Many of the climbers were on an adventure of a lifetime. Many paid for this adventure with their lives.	2002-11-22

He states that the christian faith is not a leap in the dark but a well placed faith in Jesus. He also states that many skeptics disbelieve in God because of evil.
