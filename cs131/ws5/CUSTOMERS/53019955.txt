Yet somehow it kept me up reading all night!  It took a while to get going, but once it does, the author does an excellent job simultaneously telling the two stories.  If you're someone who is intimidated or otherwise put off by books with genealogical charts, this book is not for you! Personally, I like them - \\"the Quincunx\\" is one of my all-time favorites.  The importance of the chart also means this is probably an impossible choice for an audiobook. <br />	2004-11-16

In fact, though there's quite a lot of internal dialogue, I'm really surprised this book was never made into a movie, because the cover blurb comparison with Hitchcock is an obvious one.  The technique of presenting multiple viewpoints is done very effectively.  The writing is (rarely) a bit awkward (or maybe typos?), but this reader at least was so engrossed in the unfolding plot that I skimmed right over them.  In some ways Carlon's style reminds me of Patricia Highsmith, one of my favorite authors.<br />The only disappointment is the ending, and I won't say why.	2002-06-12
US	53019955	RMDZPRUOO76L8	0345366239	16404674	The Eight	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Good plot, medium writing	This book is well-plotted, but unfortunately badly-written (edited?).  On the good side, lots of comples interweaving across the centuries keeps you interested.  But the writing is distracting:  Here are two annoying examples from one page:  1) Wooden language - &quot;But my mind was like a knotted skein of yarn, and my stomach had cold little lumps of fear.&quot; <BR>2) &quot;Continuity&quot; problems: She gives lots of details, but they don't add up.  For instance, lots of information about the specifics of the neighborhood she lives in, and mentions &quot;The air was clean and crisp.  I could see the Empire State &amp; Chrysler buildings shimmering in the distance.&quot; But from where she was, the Chrysler building would be right in her face and the ESB not far away.  In another scene, Neville carefully describes curling up on a sofa, then accepting a glass of wine, then taking off her coat.  If you're going to go to the trouble of describing the action in that much detail, shouldn't it be a more plausible order?  <br />I feel bad, because I did like the story and some of the characterizations.  But the editor in me found some of these other problems very distracting.	2002-05-20

For some reason I always thought she would be an intimidating author and a bit too mystical for my taste.  In fact, it's her concrete details that provide the very definite auras of the places and people she describes.  So in addition to a wonderful plot and terrific characterizations, she brings to life the mid-nineteenth century in Chile and California during the Gold Rush.  I will definitely read others' of hers now, and would recommend this to anyone.	2002-05-10

The authors range from the usual suspects (travel writers like Bill Bryson) to humorists (Dave Barry) to other well-known authors (Anne Lamott) to a few I'd never heard of but will look into now (Nigel Barlow and Luis Alberto Urrea).  The stories were mostly credible and all pretty funny when you got past cringing.  I also really like the interpositioning of comics and short shorts.  If there's another installment, I'll definitely read it.  My only negative comment is that it seemed the funniest pieces were at the front, or maybe one should just read it in small doses.	2002-05-10
US	53019955	R3UJT05ES40V1S	0140263357	728659407	Comfort Woman	Books	4	2	5	N	N	Grim and real	I can't say I liked this book, despite the 4 stars, because it is SO grim.  The author captures the daughter's story well, the usual adolescent angst (aren't we all emberassed by our parents?) mixed w/ a child's acceptance of an actually bizarre situation.  The mother's story is literally inconceivable to someone born into the comfortable middle-class American circumstances I was, but no less believable for that.  The interweaving of the two stories is generally skillful, but sometimes a little confusing.  A quick read that will stay with you.	2002-04-22

Lots of plot and character crammed into a slim volume.  It's a thriller that's worth rereading even after you know the plot, to see what you missed along the way.  Like &quot;Blackwater,&quot; the other of Ekman's books that I've read, it's enormously evocative of the Swedish north country and a great read for that alone.  Despite the uniquely Scandinavian milieu, thecharacters are universal, even if not particularly sympathetic.	2002-04-16

Overall, the writing is wonderful, the characterizations sharp, the intermingling of many stories effective.  BUT, at the end you are still left wondering about motivations, particularly of the central character.  Though things were tied up neatly, I at least was left somewhat unsatisfied.  It won't stop me from reading her other books though.	2002-04-14

Some of the selections are much better than others; there were enough mediocre ones to keep the rating to 3 stars.  You'd think the premise broad enough to be able to come up w/ uniformly good stories.  It definitely introduced me to some new authors I'll follow up on (one of the best reasons to read a collection like this). The editor did a nice job of covering a range of historical periods. I particularly loved the inclusion of a short piece of Herodotus, both for the story itself and because of the creativity involved in including him in the collection.	2002-04-14
US	53019955	R1CQC1ICD05D0X	073664783X	393575721	Cold Dog Soup	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Not for everyone	This is a fairly gruesome book - w/out giving anything away it's basically the odyssey of someone trying to dispose of a dog's corpse in New York City.  It's funny in a dark and perverse way (to say the least).  The whole time I listened to it (on audiotape) I kept thinking I wasn't really enjoying it.  Yet, that was some time ago and bits of it stick w/ me, which always seems like a good sign.  I got in a cab recently w/ an unusual load in a trash bag and kept laughing thinking of the book.  But it's definitely not for the easily offended.  Very different from \\"The Church of Dead Girls,\\" the other Stephen Dobyns book I've read and enjoyed.	2002-04-07

This book was very good on several levels:  The mystery itself is intriguing and sometimes edge-of-your-seat suspenseful.  Especially as a New Yorker, I LOVE the description of New York City at the turn of the (previous) century.  The littlest details add up to be very evocotavive. I also enjoyed the forensic and social history items.  But most important was the psychological aspect.  Without giving the plot away, it raises issues and can help people think about a current and very disturbing. criminal case.  <br />I'd read The Alienist so long ago that I barely remember it, but think this probably isn't quite as good. That's why it got a 4 rather than a 5.	2002-03-25

It was disappointing, since I've liked others of Coover's books.  This one is written in a stream of consciousness style reminiscent of James Joyce/\\"Ulysses\\" (which I liked a lot).  Similarly, it also is incredibly literate and erudite, lots of language play which still somehow was mostly just hard and not fun the way language should and can be.  I could appreciate the humor intellectually, but it wasn't really funny.  The subject matter is a cynical take on a dark subject, the Rosenberg executions.  I can certainly understand why its release was so contoversial.  It might help to know more about the period but as someone who came of political age (later) during the Watergate years I know little about Nixon as VP and many of the social references were lost on me.	2002-03-23

This is a wonderful book, a novelistic memoir whose protaganistic every reader can empathize with.  While it makes the reader appreciate a world very different from today's London, the characters are in no way dated.  It's funnier than I expected, but definitely has a dark side as well.	2002-02-24

My only caveat: start earlier in the Discworld series - starting here made for a confusing beginning and the uncomfortable sense that I was missing stuff.	2002-02-18

Something to read more for ideas than action, more so than Forster's other works.  As someone who grew up in an EXTREMELY liberal household, it was a real eye-opener, putting emotional substance onto my intellectual knowledge about intolerance.  I read this sandwiched between twice seeing Tom Stoppard's \\"The Invention of Love\\" about A.E. Housman, and found them enormously complementary; each really adding to my understanding of the other.	2002-02-18

The basic premise is that authors identified historical turning points and hypothesized as to how history might have been altered with a different outcome.  A great idea.  I liked it, but found a lot of variability w/in the authors' interpretations of this premise, and their assumptions about their readers' knowledge levels.  So sometimes when reading an unfamiliar scenario, I would get truly lost between fact and conjecture.  I read very little history, which didn't help.  At the time it seemed somewhat boring, but several times found myself mentally returning to some of the essays and ideas.  There was substantial variability in the writing quality as well.	2002-02-18

These stories describe completely recognizable worlds, but  &quot;gone slightly mad&quot; as one review accurately puts it.  Some are  enormously disturbing - I tried not to fall asleep in the middle of one  because I feared the nightmares it would kindle!<br />That said, it's far from  my favorite Highsmith.  The stories just don't grip like most of her work -  I couldn't stay awake when I tried.  Peculiarly, many of them seem both too  short, i.e. sketchy, and too long, i.e.moral/story could have been  delivered much more quickly.<br />Perhaps mostly a good book for Highsmith  completists; it's always interesting to read a favorite author's forays  into a different genre.	2000-03-26

Though I wasn't looking for a sensationalist approach to the topic, itwas dry, dry, dry.  The fact that so many of the reviews I'd seen referred to it as &quot;readable&quot;  should have been a red flag.  Readable compared to what?
