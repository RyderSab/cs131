I got the idea from a friend who teaches 7th grade Texas History.  Readers follow Timmy on an adventure through the state. He visits several great places along the way.  It was fun to use the illustrations and the clues to try and figure out what area we were in.  My students and I enjoyed our field trip across Texas.  Tumbelweed Tom on the Texas Trail is another great tool for teachers.	2002-07-25

After reading ALL of the preceeding Logan stories by Taylor, I couldn't wait to dive into this book.  It's a wonderful \\"coming of age\\" story.  Cassie Logan and  her brother Stacy, along with their childhood friends find themselves on what turns out to be a more than an eventful journey to Memphis.  Cassie and the others experience the South in the early 1900's outside of the protective reach of their father David, Uncle Hammer, Mr. Morrison, and family friend Wade Jamison.  Readers begin to see Cassie as a young woman instead of a little girl in this story.  We still see some of the  characters from the previous books and are introduced to a list of exciting new ones.  I really think that this is the best of Taylor's novels.  I hope there will be a follow-up.	2002-07-24

This story explains how the Logan family came to be the owners of their land in Mississippi.  It's the story of Paul Edward Logan, Caroline (whom we know better as Big Ma), and their faithful \\"friend\\" Mitchell Thomas.  It begins with Paul Edward as a boy on  his father's plantation in Georgia. The relationship between Paul's father and mother is one of confusion for Paul Edward. The story takes us on a journey across the south and through years of hard work and determination.  The characters that we've come to know through Taylor's other books are \\"introduced\\" in this book.  I was excited as I made connections between this story and the others.  It's a touching story and I highly recommend it.	2002-07-24

Taylor's I was determined to finish reading the entire series over my summer break.  I am happy to say that I DID IT!  These books are great and I have used them as a teaching tool in my classroom.  Children of many ages are able to relate to the characters in some way.  This story deals with several issues that people in the South faced in the early 1900's.   Just as the others, the story is touching.  The issue of voting rights for African-Americans in a key element in this book.  Cassie and her family find themselves in a tense situation to say the least as they attempt to help a family friend register to vote in rural Mississippi.  This is just one of the many ordeals that the Logan's find themselves facing in this story.  Some of the storyline seems incomplete but overall it's a wonderful book!	2002-07-24

I bought the first Junie B. book for my 6 year old daughter in August.  It's now June and she's waiting for the next book in the series to come out! I couldn't buy them fast enough for her! We began by reading the books \\"together\\", I read to her mostly.  Now she can finish a book in an hour or two.  Not only is she completing the book, but she's comprehending what she's read.  This collection is an excellent tool for getting kids interested and keeping them interested in reading.  I have started my own personal collection to use in my classroom.  I highly recommend this series to any young reader.  I enjoy Park's writing and this is just another great character that she's created.  The books are easy to read and are written in \\"kid\\" language. Get ready to laugh!!!	2002-06-05

It taught them lessons about fairness, determination, and love.  They were captured by the writing style.  This is a beautiful story of a young boy's love for his family and his dog.  It can be used along with the video as an EXCELLENT compare/contrast lesson.  The vocabulary can be adjusted for any grade level.  It's wonderful for teachers but it's also just a really touching story.  I recommend it to any animal lover!	2002-05-05

I am simply facinated by the Logan series that Mildred D. Taylor has created.  Born and raised in Mississippi, I have seen first hand the actions that Taylor writes about.  I share the books with my students. I plan to read this one next week.  I can't wait.  Mississippi Bridge gives us a look into the character Jeremy Simms.  The story is one of pride and human nature. This story, along with Taylor's others, is an excellent teaching tool.  Children of all ages can learn from our past mistakes through these touching and true to life stories.  I highly recommend ANY and ALL of the Logan series books!	2002-05-05

It's GREAT for teaching the reading skill compare/contrast.  Easy to use with a Venn Diagram.

They realized right away that it was a Marc and Laurie Brown book and were excited about reading it.  It's been almost two years since we first opened the book and we still read it often.  It helps me talk about our changed family in terms that they can understand. It also helps me to understand what my children are feeling, it's much easier for them to tell me when they can look at a picture and relate to what the character is feeling. I highly recommend this book to any family that is facing divorce or that has been through it.  It also deals with the changes that may take place long after the divorce.  GREAT BOOK!!!!!	2001-07-12

It's great for any age, I've used it in both fourth and second grades and it's always a bit hit!  This book takes a look at the lighter side of being the underdog as a kid. Skinnybones/Alex is a thrill a minute and Park uses everyday words and phrases that keep everyone rolling! This makes it REAL easy to &quot;get into character&quot; while reading, that's part of why it's so well liked, kids love watching adults act like nuts every once in a while. I highly recommend this one!	2000-04-30

I can sit for hours and read the short stories over and over.  I've noticed that my pastor uses alot of them in his sermons also.  It just warms my heart when I read the touching stories about struggles and triumphs in the  lives of others.  Some say that the series is depressing but I find that  when I'm in a dark moment I can read or recall some of the stories I've  read and I feel better.  They just help shed new light on certain  situations.  Great gifts also.  I've given them to friends and family  members on different occasions.  They loved them.	2000-04-30

We discussed how we have have the ability to make someone else feel bad and how we can in the end regret the things we say  and do to others.  The story helped us throughout the year in certain  situations where students were giving others a hard time for whatever  reason.  We stopped many times to discuss the outcome of their actions and  referred to The Hundred Dresses in our discussions.  Great lesson!	2000-02-13

I used the writing to give my students a sense of what life was like for blacks in the early 1900's.  My students loved it so much that we read two more of Taylor's Logan books.  I've since shared the series with my students in Texas. I've used it in grades 2, 4, and 5.  Each time I fall more in love with Taylor's characters.  I'm yet to have a single student disappointed.  I was thrilled to complete the series over the summer and I can't wait to share other selections by Taylor with my class this year.  \\"The Well\\" is written from the point of view of a young David Logan.  He tells of some serious incidents that take place between the Logan family and the Simms, a white family that lives near the them. Readers get a somewhat realistic account of race relations in the south following the Civil War.  This, along with Mildred D. Taylors other stories, is an excellent teaching tool.  I highly recommend the series to readers of all ages.  The language is pretty harsh, but without it the true meaning of the story would be lost.	1999-12-26

I can honestly say that all of the children were touched by this amazingly beautiful story of friendship and love. It's a great book to  use as comparison with the movie.  It showed my students that there is more  to good entertainment than sitting and watching the television all day.   They realized that using the imagination and getting lost in a good book  can be just as entertaining if not more so.  I also used this book in a  second grade classroom and children at that young age were just as deeply  touched.  I recommend this book to people of all ages, children and adults  alike.	1999-12-07
