Where else can you find an articulate saga spanning 40 years about prostitutes, tattoo artists, school teachers, organs, actors and a short, Hollywood movie star?   Since I finished the book, I keep coming back to the idea of all the organs, and realize that William is obsessed with both musical organs, and the largest organ of the body: the skin.  His tattoos were of music, written on an organ of his own - his skin.  I shake my head at this, but am not surprised because I can't imagine anyone else but Irving making this stuff up; it's just too good.    I am from the suburbs of Toronto but living in L.A. and I have recently found myself wandering into tattoo parlors for the first time in my life.  In asking the pierced and tattooed folks who frequent such establishments if they have ever heard of a Rose of Jericho, I have come to the conclusion that the term was created by Mr. Irving.  From my limited, yet entertaining research in this town and on the internet, I have discovered that a Rose of Jericho is a shrubby bush that grows in an arid climate and bears virtually no resemblance to a true rose.  Of course, any tattoo artist has flash of a rose with clever folds but tattoo people have a more profane name for such a design which I'll let you think about.    I also asked those same people if they had heard of \\"Until I Find You\\", a new book by John Irving and although one tattoo artist admitted to being a `book worm', I haven't met anyone in those circles who has read it.  I might just get a tat myself when I finally find a tattoo artist who has read the book.  So, until I find you, I am tattoo free.	2005-10-01

Lolly Winston works the Kubler-Ross stages of grief into the well developed and likeable main character of Sophie.  I found myself enjoying Good Grief far more than I thought I would; the packaging is very chick lit and doesn't really suit the novel, but frankly that is all that I could find wrong with it.  The story moves along at a rapid pace and Sophie's self-inspection is superb.   She doesn't ever get over her loss, she just learns how to deal with it, and that is what we can all only hope for after losing a loved one.   <br /> <br />I look forward to reading more from this very talented writer. <br />	2005-05-30

So far, I haven't been swept away with admiration for the Chick Lit genre, but this book is truly unique in its realm.  I found it to be well written, highly comical and the main character is very well developed, on many levels.<br />Good In Bed might remind you of another book that you have read before, and that would be one of those stories that was heart warming and an easy, light read.  I look forward to reading more from this talented, young author.<br />A surly reviewer on this page has suggested that one read Watership Down instead of Good In Bed and I had to laugh at that.  I say read Watership Down too, not instead and then realize that every book we read is as different as each person who walks the earth.  By knowing many books, we learn more about various genres.<br />Given that I have done my duty after enjoying the book and professed that the book was a good read, I do have to point out an editorial gaffe.  On page 285, Cannie and Maxi have just purchased greasy fries and are eating them with their feet \\"dangling in the water\\" at Santa Monica Pier.   Santa Monica Pier is too high over the water to have your feet in the water while sitting on the edge of the pier.  It does offer a nice image though!<br />Nicole Flowers	2004-05-13

As with truly intelligent writing, for days after the last page was turned, I was left thinking of the magnitude of this tale and all that it implied.  When I first heard of the premise, I wondered how it would possibly work, but then, sea voyages are nothing new to literature.  Moby Dick, The Old Man and The Sea, and of course Kon Tiki all took place over long periods at sea.  Life of Pi contains elements of those aforementioned master works, but maintains its own special dignity by adding spiritual lessons to this unique genre.<br />There are many in the world today who could learn from the intelligent look at the innocence of a child who becomes entranced with the Muslim faith, Christianity, and Hinduism. It is through the varied faiths that he has that Pi is able to survive his ordeal.<br />This book is simply astonishing and I recommend it highly.	2004-03-24

Although the book drags at points, it is a true look into the psyche of a brilliant but lost adolescent who seeks to find his place in the world.  <br />An autobiographical aspect is almost always present with this writer, and this first work is no exception.  Ygelesias was only 15 when he penned this novel, and the bulk of the characters are teenagers.  The protagonist's name RAUL suggests a kinship with his own Rafael, and the irony was not lost on me that RAUL's father is RAFAEL.  <br />I look forward to seeing more work from Yglesias, since the time between novels has become too long.	2004-03-24

Set in modern day London, the main haracter Kate is trying her hand at being Super Woman, but as she and some of the rest of us have figured out, there is no way that we can do it all.  Every woman who has tried in vain to master being the perfect mother, home keeper, career woman and of course, wife will relate to this remarkably well crafted story.<br />Although the book is unique in its own right, there are traces of Bridget Jones at the end of each chapter where Kate goes through her Must Remember list.  Pearson did such a masterful job in defining all of her characters down to the smallest detail, that it became hard for me to even like the over-achieving Kate until halfway through the book.  Then, as the history of her own childhood became clear, the pieces came together deftly and I realized why she was trying so hard.   <br />The fierce and starving heroine Scarlett O'Hara once said, \\"As God as my witness, I will never go hungry again.\\"  Kate never wanted to be poor again, and at great cost she finally realizes that having money isn't the only wealth we need to have a happy home.	2004-03-24

There are ethereal, beautiful scenes in this story that are generally found only in dreams or old Fellini movies.  Those images have haunted me since I closed the cover for the last time and are part of what prompted me to write this review. <br />The main character of Paul Iverson was crafted with deliberate attention to each minute detail; his palpable grief came across in each of his odd actions and my heart was touched by his love for the dog that he and his wife had shared.    That being said, I found the character of his wife Lexy to be less compelling in that there didn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to her madness, but I wonder if that was just the point.   The couple's Rhodesian Ridgeback Lorelei, is the most real dog that I have ever read about in literature; her presence is a big part of what makes the book so good.   Another reason are the very clever surprises that come out just when you least expect it.<br />I suggest this book to readers who enjoy a sentimental story, but just make sure you sit with a box of tissues at your side.<br />Nicole Flowers	2003-10-20

Seeley approaches this important subject with an open mind and has crafted her book with case studies and examples of different ethnicities and their unique presenting problems. Those presenting problems were in each case coupled with the issue of clients in therapy with a white, American therapist.  <br />The book's conclusion: \\"Constructing a Cultural Psychotherapy\\" really holds the heart of the issue; that is, what can those in the counseling field do to bridge the gaps between themselves and their ethnic clients. It would have been beneficial if the entire book were as informative as the last section.  Nonetheless, there is a lot of valuable information in the pages of this work, and I recommend this book to anyone in the counseling profession, as well as to the client who has felt alienated from their therapist due to a difference in ethnicity.	2001-03-09

I finished this outstanding book a few days ago, and Mary Karr's eloquent words are still dancing in my mind.  I want to write a review that will make a future reader understand the brilliance that this writer holds, but any words that I use to describe the poetry that falls off of the pages of \\"Cherry\\" will be simply that, mere words.   <br />It is not the gripping plot or suspense that makes \\"Cherry\\" so remarkable, since there isn't either of these elements.  Simply put, this is the story of a skinny, teenage girl who grew up in a boring town and the many situations that she found herself in - it's all in the telling.  I admire the courage with which this book was written - there is candor, zero pity, and respect and devotion for a family that often times drove her mad.  Mary is proof that with enough love in your house, you can come out okay - Charlie and Pete did pretty well despite their faults.  Together they gave Mary a plentiful basket of juicy plums which she ate, believed in and understood their value, and is now spinning into her own form of gold.<br />After reading \\"Liar's Club\\", there was no question that I would read \\"Cherry\\" too. I am anxiously looking forward to Mary Karr's next book, and any others that follow.	2001-01-11

Susan Orlean is an amazing writer; she has taken a subject for which she has professed no interest, (she gave orchids away to avoid their ultimate never-ending appeal!) and yet she has managed to write a gripping account of her time spent persuing the accounts of an orchid-thief/lunatic/self-proclaimed genius.  <br />I quickly read through this well written book through 2 flu-ridden afternoons.  Susan's swamp predicaments, ability to make a magazine-style story enfold into an entire book, and dead-pan humor, made me follow through to the end.  I couldn't help but relate to the tales of Orchid afficianados:  as I was reading, I was snatching glimpses at my own multiple rows of double, triple and quadruple leafed but currently flowerless white phaleonopsis.  <br />I am looking forward to a novel from this writer - she is truly talented!	2000-11-17

After having sold at least 50 copies everywhere I went in my initial praises of &quot;Simple Abundance&quot;, I was quite disappointed at this book.

I sent her a copy and received a thank you note saying that the book was a life saver/changer for HER.  <br />Hmmm... So what happened?  &quot;Simple Abundance&quot; appealed to me since it seemed to reach &quot;everywoman&quot;.   Tragically, it appears that the enormous success of that book changed the author's cozy life and &quot;Something More&quot; has a tinge of anger at her new solitary life.<br />As such, I would recommend this book to single women or women with grown children searching for that &quot;something more&quot; - whether it be in career or relationships.  But, if you are in the throes of a young family - you already have your &quot;more than enough&quot; and this book is not for you.	2000-11-14

Anyone unfamiliar with Anne Tyler's writing might be suprised at the plot of this book and the collection of quirky characters therein.

The last chapter entitled The Guide is filled with a wealth of information - menus, an index of culinary utensils, description of uncommon and exotic foods and spices, equipment and food sources and a directory of specialty shops.  I also like the built-in fabric book markers - great to mark favorite recipes.<br />This informative book has been a welcome addition to my cooking library and I recommend it to anyone who loves to entertain.

The plot itself was quite interesting and should be attributed to the novel's success.  In the hands of another writer I imagine that this could have been quite good, however under Nicholas Sparks pen, it comes out as ***** pulp fiction.

Miller has written a book that at times is troubling, and at times suspenseful, and ends on a shocking and sad note.  No, I didn't respect the choices that the main character Anna made at times, and I think her character remained kind of stagnant and a little self absorbed throughout the book, but it was the premise behind the story that gripped me:  Other people can and will decide for a child if a situation is deemed unfit.  <br />Was Molly's situation with her mother unstable or unfit based upon Anna's lifestyle and the two incidents that brought it all to question?   Opinions will vary if Anna was indeed A &quot;Good Mother&quot;, and for that reason I find this book extremely thought provoking and well thought out. <br />A good, deep read.	2000-11-10

This emotional book is worth the read for its ability to make one think about the many issues that were layed out brilliantly: a young man and an older lover, his high social status versus her working class, his education versus her ignorance.  Add to that the guilt that the new generation of Germans who had nothing to do with the Nazis are still faced with; the guilt that is the curse of their heritage.  <br />Schlink brings all of these points togther for a fascinating and emotional book through the poignant characters of Michael and Hanna.  <br />Although the translation creates stilted reading (thus 4 stars and not 5), I recommend this book highly.	2000-11-10

I bought this book two weeks after the adorable pound puppy we rescued was wrecking my carpets and chewing everything in sight -I needed help!  The best advice on any of the pages is a crate - I would never have shelled out the money until I read the author's sound words. Once I began to follow the crate-training instructions, I began to see success.  I was thrilled at the thorough advice on &quot;raising your dog&quot; that this book lays out in a straight forward and sometimes comical fashion.  <br />This book is is a great help if you are making the huge decision to get a dog, or if you already have one and would like to improve your relationship.	2000-11-09

The first time I read this book was out loud to my son (usually I read them to myself first) and I stopped short as soon as I realized that the mother bought the screeching child all of the toys to pacify him!  I thought, What kind of message is this? Even though they end up giving the new toys away at the end (only the new toys mind you), the book didn't redeem itself in my eyes.  In my view, immediate gratification of a child's selfish wishes and dealing with the consequences later is not a way to handle a dispute with a four year old.  <br />I chose to go back and re-read this book to my child saying that Sam's mommy shouldn't have bought all of the toys Sam wanted and that she was a silly, pretend mommy who only lives in a book, because no REAL mommy would do that. I feel like one silly Mommy myself for buying a children's book without reading it first but I thought that the famous Dr S would have a good message to tell. I was wrong.<br />If you are a parent who indulges your child's each and every whim, well then, go ahead and buy this book for them too because you would be the type of person who might enjoy it.	2000-11-08

This book never ceases to amaze me when I pull it off the shelf for a little inspiration or food for my soul.  Chris Giftos is aptly named for he gifts us with this book and his designs. Each arrangement featured suits the area and rooms of the Met as just the right thing for the surroundings.  His knowledge of color and combinations of flowers is insightful.  Fabulous photos and design aside; it is also an interesting read.  <br />&quot;A Bouquet From The Met&quot; is well worth the price if you are at all interested in floral design, either professionally or as a hobby.<br />Lila Acheson Wallace was an incredible woman to have allowed New Yorkers the enjoyment of Giftos's flowers at the Met.  I can't wait until the day when I can see it all up close.	2000-11-06

Not only is the floral design breathtaking, Ms. Roehm gives excellent design tips on color, which vase to use, what flowers work best with each other, and on conditioning flowers whether they be cut from your own garden or purchased through a wholesale flower market.  <br />The title of this book is so perfect, as it is truly about flowers and style, and it's well worth the price.	2000-11-05

To me, two stems of Casablanca lilies by themselves in a vase (page 95) is not an arrangement worthy of two pages in a book.  There was not one arrangement in the pages that I found to be anything other than leaves or sticks in a pot or jar.  The arrangements were pretty and simple, yes, but the photography was really what this book was about.  It couldn't have been about the floral design as there wasn't any.	2000-11-05

This great book is a perfect addition to the library of anyone  who loves to get a little green under their thumb nail.  Ever present are Martha's signature monochromatic designs, but this collection is also peppered with multi colored explosions of flowers.  Her conditioning tips are excellent, as well as her index of useful design tools.  Even if you don't have the gumption to design yourself, the photos are spectacular; she even makes gladiolas look good.  <br />This book is a must-have for both flower and Martha lovers.	2000-11-05

I have been running my own floral design business for parties and special events for two years now, and this book has proved itself to be one of my most valuable resources.

US	50736833	R4W4Z24O641RO	0060932759	694565872	Daughter of Fortune	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Ambitious	This was an ambitious piece of work, that left me feeling glad I had read it, but slightly disappointed.  The main character was spiritful and well developed, but her mission in life was questionable.  Allende let us know from the beginning that Eliza's lover was really a bad guy, but it took too long for Eliza to come to that conclusion.  I liked the little surprises in the story, but what was truly fascinating was Eliza's role as a mute Chinaman.  The experience was greatly liberating and allowed her more freedoms than she would have ever guessed.  <br />Definitely a well thought out plot, and well written, but lacking that little extra something that takes a book to a higher level.	2000-11-04

The characters were all diverse but what I enjoyed most of all was the transformation of Sam from a lost soul to someone who gained her own autonomy.  I always appreciate a novel that can show a character go through a catharsis and then come out to be a better person at the final page.  Despite the divorce theme, the lightest Oprah pick in a long time.  Loved the return phone call from Martha Stewart - such sound advice too!	2000-11-03

John Irving is the sort of author that once you have become familiar with his work, opening up and reading any of his novels is like coming home.  I read this book years ago and recently re-read it since Owen Meany has lived in my head for years.  Was it because all of his dialogue was in all caps which made him seem to be shouting throughout the entire novel?  Was it because his character was among the most memorable characters of any book I've ever read?  All of those reasons but mostly because Irving can write a story.  This is an amazing piece of art from one of the greatest writers ever.  If you only read two Irving books in your life, read this and The World According to Garp.	2000-11-03

I started the diet in January of 2000 after reading the book cover to cover.  I combined the diet with a workout program of 3 days per week at the gym riding the stationary bike for 45 minutes each time, and doing a half hour of weights and stretches.  After 4 months I lost 30% of my body fat, and a total of 15 lbs, and now I am at an ideal weight for my age, height, sex and body type and have never felt better physically. I also noticed that a sinus condition that I had been dealing with for the last two years virtually went away.  <br />THIS DIET WORKS, but you HAVE to read the book and do it EXACTLY as Dr. Atkins says, or you will not see the results that you want. <br />There are so many misconceptions about this diet, but if naysayers would actually read the book, they would see that the diet does not say that you must eat only protein forever - it is only during the induction part.  <br />The reading is very easy to understand and Dr. Atkins uses many case studies to prove his point.  Through his writing, I learned to look at products in the supermarket differently, and he is so right about sugar being in all of the fad diet food products.  No wonder they don't work!  I am happy to promote this diet and the book at any time, because nothing else ever worked as well as this for me.	2000-11-03

If you don't know and love Irving, you will wonder what it's all about.  Personally, I am a huge fan; I've read all of his novels and so this was a welcome insight into the life of one of America's treasures.  The first chapter on how he became a story teller is vintage John.  On another note, he definitely loves wrestling, and you are faced to read tedious round by round accounts of important matches in his life, but that's okay, because now I know where he got a lot of the foundations for Garp.  <br />A few things stood out in this book that elevated John Irving to the status of one classy guy:  his love and devotion to his sons, and he never has one bad thing to say about his ex-wife, the mother of his children.  In fact he thanks her for her diligence in photographing the boys growing up and some of her shots are found in the center  of the book.  <br />Of the multitude of areas in this book, I enjoyed most a short story entitled &quot;Interior Space&quot; inwhich an Austrian man (who else?) laments over the sale of his house and the tree thereon.  &quot;You will not the tree down-chop.&quot;  Irving truly is the master at replicating the juxtaposition of words in the dialogue of native German speakers speaking English.<br />As fans know, the wait between Irving's novels is unbearably long, and Piggy Snead makes for an entertaining interlude.	2000-11-03

The writing was great and I was hooked until about three quarters of the way through  and then it was as if a completely different author ended the tale!

This is a feel good story about a young girl who has nobody in the world who gives a hoot about her and the wonderfully eclectic group of characters (multiracial too) who come into her life.  It is through both the kindness of these strangers and the love for her new baby that Novalee sees for the first time that life can be wonderful.  Hurray for Billy Letts who believes strongly enough that there are still good people in America and that she chose to write about them.  On that note, I believe Sam Walton would have given her a lot more money!	2000-11-01

Judy Blume was my absolute favorite writer when I was under 19 (a dozen or so years ago) and I was thrilled when I saw that she had written what was marketed as an adult novel.  However I was less than thrilled after I read it.  I think &quot;light&quot; in every respect would be the best way to decribe this book.  She should go back to writing what she does best: the angst of teenagers. Be it their first love, first boyfriends, all the juicy stuff that teenage girls love to read.	2000-11-01

Everyone knows the success of the Ya Ya book, but this one is actually better (if that's possible)and should be read first to get the true vision that the author had in mind.

No surprise since this book is amazingly phenomenal in its scope - the mother and her daughters are so amazingly diverse, the plot is as suspensful as as a thriller, the writing flows off the page to transport you into the jungle.  Take this book through to the end and you will be amazed.  I have read hundreds of books (honest) including all of Kingsolver's work (except her latest) and I can honestly say that Poisonwood Bible is the best novel I have ever read.	2000-11-01

Deborah Lott definitely has the gift for writing well, and this book is as hard to put down as a good novel.  The indepth research that she went through to write the book made me realize that IN SESSION is not about mere postulations, but about truths.  Since she has already studied the field of psychotherapy so intently and she cares so much, I truly believe that she would serve the profession well by becoming a therapist herself. I look forward to watching the career of this insightful woman.	2000-10-29
