Iles conveys so much meaning and emotion in his prose, he is the master of getting a point or an emotion across without laying it out literally.  Blood Memory is just so far beyond other conventional thrillers out there, I don't know how else to say it!	2005-03-16

But if you are new to the series I would say start with this one or Angels Flight.  The Last Coyote is a great mystery story with great characters.  Harry Bosch has been suspended from the LAPD pending a psychiatric evaluation for throwing his supervisor through a plate glass window.  He uses his time off to solve the mystery that has haunted him his whole life, the murder of his own mother in 1961 Los Angeles.  <br />He digs up the police report and soon discovers that it was not quite as thorough as it should have been.  It is a great book.	2004-05-24

If you are older you will feel nogstaltic for your younger days.  <br />The first half of the book sets up the stories on all the main characters who are all very interesting.  We see what drove them to wind up in Spain in the resort town of Torremolinos.  Once everyone is situated, we follow the group throughout their journeys to Pamplona, Southern Africa, Morroco, and Portugal.  <br />James Michener, who wrote this when he was about 60 or so, shows that he has a great understanding of the youth culture.  Even though this takes place over 30 years ago, it did not seem dated as Michener captured youth's universal characteristics.  <br />My advice to anyone who is travelling around Europe, order this book right now and take it with you in your backpack!	2003-02-01

It starts with the binding of the book, the texture that is unique among other hardcover bestsellers.  <br />Like Jurassic Park did with biotech, we get an introduction to where we are with nanotechnology right now and where we are going in the future.  Then we strap ourselves in for a fun &quot;what if&quot; ride.  <br />Like his other thrillers &quot;Sphere&quot; and &quot;Jurassic park&quot;, he does a masterful job with the set up.  Giving us haunting images of things I won't reveal for fear of giving anything away.  We are kept guessing and are entertained and fascinated along the way.  <br />Like Disclosure, Congo, Sphere, Timeline and others we get to see some pretty cool toys and technology.  Michael Crichton is the undisputed master of the Science techno thriller.  He doesn't quite hit a homerun here as he did in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; but this is a solid Triple into the gap!  <br />Recomended!!	2003-01-29

I have never read a Michener book I didn't consider a treasure, and this one is no exception.  <br />For anyone who is afraid of reading a James Michener historical fiction novel....Just because the books are long and you might think it will be a boring history novel, it is not!  The books are fascinating, trust me I have read almost a dozen of them so far and they have all resonated with me, Hawaii, Chesapeake, Centennial, The Source, Poland, The Drifters, Caribbean, Alaska, TEXAS!

The two storylines involve a mysterious boy on the run with his dog and a deformed girl who has a murderer for a stepfather.  The woman next door and her aunt try to save this girl.  <br />In probably half of Koontz's books there is a dog involved and this one is no exception.

This book is unlike the Talisman in that it is not a &quot;Quest&quot; novel and doesn't really spend much time in the Territories that I loved so much in the Talisman.  Nevertheless Black House is SK's (and Straub's) best book since I would say &quot;IT&quot;  The characters are great, especially Henry.  And the narration tool used is so &quot;god pounding&quot; great that I was really blown away!  It was also interesting as this book had so much to do with the Dark Tower series, as I think most all future SK books will.  So while a person can pick up &quot;Black House&quot; and enjoy it....please read &quot;The Talisman,&quot; all four Dark Tower Books, and for that matter &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; before you read this.

One of the things that was a little tough about finally reading the fellowship of the ring was the fact that I am used to reading thriller novels and historical fiction.  Therefore the language of this book took some getting used to.  I felt at times that I was wading my way through some slow parts.  But slow compared to the stuff I usually read I guess.

All in all I am glad that  I read this book, but for me it was not one of Micheners best works,  however it is still fantastic.  I guess I am more of a fan of the epic  historical novel of his like &quot;The Source&quot; and  &quot;Centennial&quot;	2000-08-23

In Rainbow Six we see John Clark and other old friends like Chavez  assembled into a super elite counter terrorism force.  In several exciting  scenes we see them take out terrorists in a variety of locales, my favorite  of which is an amusement park.  We also get to read about super high tech  military gadgets such as a device that can pinpoint anyones location  through detecting their heartbeat.  The climax to the novel is humorous and  gratifying.	2000-08-22

The books size (1078 pages) will turn off a few and that is  unfortunate, because they are missing out on a life changing experience.  This book will enhance your knowledge of why conflicts occur in the Middle  East, and although everyone has heard of the Holocaust, they may not know  about the Spanish Inquisition, and all the other points throughout history  where Jews are slaughtered by Christians.
