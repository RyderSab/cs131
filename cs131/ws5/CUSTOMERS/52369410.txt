She is one of those writers who isn't ashamed to portray women as they really are; be they fat, thin, rich, poor, beautiful, plain, smart, ignorant, and on and on. She gives them such personality. They are so...believeable.<br /><br />I love this quote:<br /><br />Weiner recognizes that the real mysteries -- the ones without tidy \\"Murder, She Wrote\\" endings -- are why we marry whom we marry, why we stay with our spouses (and why they stay with us), whether we're raising our kids as well as we should, and why, in the grand scheme of things, any of it matters. These unknowables couldn't be in more competent, funny or empathetic hands than Weiner's.<br /><br />It really captures her perfectly; much better than any of my words could.<br /><br />Goodnight Nobody is being billed as Weiner's first mystery and I suppose it is a mystery, but it is a lot like her other novels as well. And it's damn funny.<br /><br />When another mother in the suburban sleepy town of Upchurch, (a little play on words here???) Connecticut is murdered, Kate Klein isn't going to stand by and let the police do their job. This bored, \\"accidental mother of three,\\" decides she's going to take matters into her own hands. (The accidental part is hilarious). The only problem is finding the time what with playdates, carpools, and nursery school times getting in the way. I don't want to give away to much of this delightful story but this satire is enormously entertaining and highly recommended.	2005-10-05

He meets Maggie (nee Margaret) Towne in college, they fall in love, and she takes him home to meet the family. She's from a town called Margarettown and it is inhabited by 4 people; Old Margaret, the giggling youngster May, brooding teenager Mia, and the sour middle-aged Marge. The only one missing is the suicidal Greta. And they are all the same person, only at different ages. I'm not giving much away to reveal that these women are all the same woman (\\"you won't find a woman in the world that doesn't have a couple other women inside her,\\" she says), however whether Margarettown is a real place or of N.'s invention is left in doubt. The explanation given by Old Margaret, of what happened to make her split into many different Margarets) is strange yet also strangely understandable.<br /><br />This novel is a wonderful portrayal of how one's identity is effected by life experience and aging. At times I was afraid Zevin wouldn't be able to hold all her plots together but they came out at the end all neatly tied in a bow. This story is darkly whimsical and the writing lighthearted, yet poignant.	2005-09-26

Ariah Littrell becomes, on her wedding night, the solitary and tragic figure \\"The Widow Bride of the Falls\\" on her first day of her honeymoon after her strange and sexually confused husband commits suicide. Considering herself now damned, she stays at the Falls, waiting for her husband to surface from the Falls. While she waits, Dirk Burnaby, a handsome, wealthy and kind lawyer falls in love with her and marries her to the upset of her family and in-laws. Their happiness is complete when Ariah conceives and gives birth to three children; Chandler, Royall and Juliet.<br /><br />Yet, a dark cloud hangs over Ariah. Still convinced she is \\"damned,\\" her increasingly erratic and eccentric behavior, coupled with Dirk's sudden desire to help a young woman who asks his help in fighting the city fathers over horrible conditions in the area known as the Love Canal, creates a rift between the two.<br /><br />This was my first reading of a work by Oates. I'm not sure why I waited so long to try a novel by her, but this definitely won't be my last. Oates tells a haunting story, where nature and humans are equally uncontrollable and self-destructive, yet is also a tale of redemption not to be missed.	2005-09-20

There were things I wanted to keep reading to find out what happened and all, but it was so painful for me to read that I just finally gave up on it. It was definitely too depressing and scared me into not wanting to send my daughter to high school. The characters, Rennie, Cherry and Amy, are wild. One has sex with any man who moves, they abuse drugs, drink, swear, smoke, they cut themselves...it's insane. Their parents were just as screwed up as they were and, while concerned that their daughters were going off course, no one seemed to care that they (the parents) might have something to do with it. The most upsetting part was that no one did anything about it (at least not in the first half I read). It became so frustrating.<br /><br />I'm sure this is probably a very good book, it's got great reviews at Amazon, but it just wasn't for me.	2005-08-30

What happens to the children of parents who write a sex-tell-all/instruction-guide (think The Joy of Sex) after they discover The Book?  What happens after their \\"so in love\\" parents get divorced?  In 1975, the Mellow parents, Paul and Roz, write a book that celebrates their love, and their love-making.  The international bestseller features the Mellows in various poses straight from the Kama Sutra in all their naked glory; including the Position they created themselves.  Holly, 15, Michael, 13, Dashiell, 8, and Claudia 6, all sit down one afternoon after Michael finds The Book. And the discovery of The Book leaves the four young Mellows changed forever.<br /><br />What is interesting is how it changes them all in such different ways.  This is a fascinating look at how sex, love, divorce, and marriage can effect the oldest and the youngest in such varied ways.  At first, I didn't think I was going to like this book, but as I continued, I became to empathize with the characters and even grew to like them.  Wolitzer writes with a deft hand, giving her characters sympathy but not becoming so over handed that it grates the nerves.  No sentence out of place, no plot unturned, this book is highly recommended.	2005-08-24

She has a massive bank overdraft to pay, a husband to have uneradicated, and the world to save from a madman fictional character, Chancellor Yorrick Kaine.

Then, perhaps, I would be able to adequately describe the way I feel about this novel. For me, this will be one of those books that will remain with me forever, the characters easily remembered, the story seared into my memory like a beautiful tattoo. I will attempt to describe what it is about and how much you should savor this book but I am sure my insufficient ability will hinder me.<br /><br />The time is postwar Barcelona, 1945, when 10-year-old Daniel Sempere wakes from a horrible nightmare. To his horror, he can no longer remember his beloved mother's face. His father tries to comfort him so to amuse his son, he takes him to a secret library; The Cemetery of Lost Books. There, Daniel is allowed to \\"adopt\\" one book. There, calling to him in that dark, mysterious chamber, Daniel finds \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" by Julian Carax. Voraciously, Daniel reads his new book in just one day, and having fallen under its' spell, he begins a search that will him many years. Along the way he meets femme fatales, a witty and delightfully horny beggar, a horrifyingly disfigured man, and in turn uncovers a tale of murder, madness, and terrible secrets that many would pay any price to keep underground. And as Daniel makes his way through Barcelona society, both high and low, he comes to understand that his own part in The Shadow of the Wind is more than that of a simple reader.	2005-08-16

I hate it when they put titles like this in the \\"Read this if you like Harry Potter\\" genre. This was nothing like Harry Potter. Well, it has magic, bogarts (which are totally different in the book), and the good vs evil plot but the writing style is completely different. I would almost venture to say that I like Sage's writing style a little bit better. I know, sacrilege.<br /><br />At birth, Septimus Heap, the seventh son of the seventh son, is carried away and thought dead, and his father Silas is given a baby girl to raise as his own...all in the space of a day. 10 years later, the new ruler (or dictator) tries to assassinate Jenna, the girl, leading the Heap family to flee their home with the help of the ExtraOrdinary Wizard and a young army guard Boy 412. The family is pursued by servants of the Necromancer and ExtraOrdinary Wizard usurper DomDaniel, a frightening character (but not quite as frightening as Lord Voldemort). I don't want to say too much more because I hate to give away anything. Watch out for Amazon, there are spoilers in their reviews of this book. Just know that, yes, if you like Harry Potter, you will probably like this book. But really, think of it more as, if you like adventure stories, you will like this book.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the next book in this trilogy; Flyte.	2005-08-09

But this book was funny, yet never disrespectful. Roach has done the unthinkable here by taking the almost taboo subject of death and making it almost lighthearted. I never quite forgot how macabre her subject is, but all the same I found myself sniggering at some of her wittisms. She greets you with a killer (oops, no pun intended) line \\"The way I see it, being dead is not terribly far off from being on a cruise ship. Most of your time is spent lying on your back.\\" and doesn't let you go until the very end, where she confesses that if her husband goes before she does, she's going to donate her brain to Harvard's Brain Bank.<br /><br />Not for the weak of stomach, Stiff is \\"curiously\\" interesting and very informative.	2005-08-08

It is the sequel to The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (yes, the movie based on this novel will be out June 1). It is considered Young Adult fiction and maybe I'm really intune with my inner teenager but I really identified with a lot of the themes in this novel. (Actually I think I would call it ChickLit for teens.) Like the first in this series, the four friends, Bridget, Carmen, Lena, and Tibby (short for Tabitha) are going to be separated for the summer. Bridget rediscovers her grandmother from Alabama and sets off to get to know her. Carmen is staying home with her single mother. Lena is also staying home, to work at the local Greek clothing store. And Tibby is going away to a college class in film making. Each friend has a rich summer, full of changes, and growing. There is heartbreak and redemption for each friend.<br /><br />Brashares is a really great writer. She turns simple prose in to poetry in places, pulling unexpectantly at heartstrings and bringing tears of remembrance to your eyes. The spark of new adolenscent love (and first heartbreak)...the pain of learning that your mother is a person too...the unexpected love of a grandparent...the pain of loosing a friend to death...Brashares writes it all with such amazing understanding of the crazy emotions teenagers go through. I can't recommend this series highly enough and I can't wait to read the next one in the series.	2005-05-20

I've read her two previous novels, Good In Bed and In Her Shoes and loved them both.  With Little Earthquakes she really pushes her writing to even greater heights. She pulls at the heart strings without getting to precious. Her characters are strong women, not without flaws, but still likeable and believable. Weiner's makes her characters feel like they are someone you met at work, or walked past on the street, or even knew your whole life. They feel like your bestest of friends and you mourn for them when you read the last page. This is quite a feat, considering one of the main characters is the wife of a basketball superstar a la Michael Jordan.<br /><br />This story follows 4 friends as they survive the first months of motherhood and a 5th friend getting over the death of her own child (from SIDS).  As a relatively new mother myself, I really identified with all the things each mother went through and came out of this book with a new appreciation for myself as well as other mothers.	2005-05-20

But Babyville probably wasn't the best place to start. Most of this novel came off as silly, fluffy, precious drivel compared to her much stronger work; Jemima J. There was little to like about her characters, they were completely unbelievable to me, with the exception of one, Sam, who was the most real character of the three main ones. All these characters were selfish, insecure, atypical women.  They all come off as being 30-something teenager-wannabees and too self-absorbed in themselves and too wrapped up in their party-every-night-lifestyles.  Come on now, there is more to life than that!<br /><br />Green just BARELY managed to redeem each of her characters by the end of the story, but it was almost too little too late.  However, I will give Green the benefit of the doubt and try more of her novels.  She is a good writer, I just feel she faultered a little bit here.	2005-05-20

Every once in awhile a book comes along that touches something deep within you, something from your past, or in your present...or even in your deepest hopes for the future.  The Dive from Clausen's Pier by Ann Packer was a little bit of all of this wrapped up into an astounding work of literature.<br />Carrie Bell, 23 and fresh out of college, has the life everyone wants.  Or, so you would think.  She has a job she loves, a fianc&eacute; who clearly adores her, friends and family who love her. To Carrie however, her life has become stifling and dull. She's lost and lonely, with no one to talk to about her feelings and really nowhere to turn for support.  Finally, ironically, when her fianc&eacute; plunges into a shallow lake and becomes paralyzed...Carrie impelled into action.  Under the cover of darkness she slips away, without a word to anyone and flees to New York City and into the arms of a man she has only met once but had felt a brief instant of understanding with.<br />Carrie spends almost a year away from home attempting to find her true self in the great city of New York.  She lives, rent free, with a friend from high school.  She falls in love.  She begins a new life. Yet all the while, something is calling her back home, something unfinished, something needing closure.<br />The Dive from Clausen's Pier is an amazing read.  Carrie's story will bring back memories of first loves, that first heartbreaking loss of that first love, and the painful decisions one makes when growing up.  Powerful and wonderfully written, The Dive from Clausen's Pier will stay with you for ages.	2002-07-03

I was lying on my bed, snuggled into my down comforter and tons of pillows.  I was completely immersed in this fantastic novel by the utterly fascinating James Welch.  It was a particularly breathtaking scene, one where your eyes move as fast as they can, you can't breathe, you can't think of anything other than the story, you can't hear, see, smell, taste anything else.  Suddenly something crashed in the next room of my house.  And my eyes moved up through the text, looking for the source of the noise!  I was so into the story, that I thought the sound was part of the story.  It took me a few minutes to realize that my cats had knocked something over in the bathroom of my very own house!<br />The Heartsong of Charging Elk is, yes, that amazing.  Charging Elk, on Oglala Sioux from the Black Hills of South Dakota, has joined Buffalo Bill's Wild West show, leaving behind his family, friends, and Indian lifestyle for money, fun, and not a little fame.  Eventually the show crosses the Atlantic to Europe.  During a show in France, ill with the flu, Charging Elk (then still a teenager) falls and breaks a couple of ribs.  Left behind in the French hospital, Charging Elk is understandably frightened.  He speaks very little English and even less French.  He escapes and decides he's going home.  Along the way he finds new friends, independance, and love.  But does he find his way back to America and his Indian way of life?<br />This absorbing work of historical fiction is one hell of a breathtaking ride.  I followed Charging Elk through the many difficulties of his life in France, laughing, crying and loving him all the way.  You will come to care for, worry about, and definitely miss Charging Elk by the time you finish reading this novel.  He is one character I will never forget and The Heartsong of Charging Elk is one book I will definitely read again and again.	2002-02-12

He married (4 times! and outlived them all!), had 7 children and put them all through school, all graduated college even though he never learned how to read.<br />Then one day, at the age of 98, he was offered the chance to learn and he seized it. A hard worker all his life, he attacked his new goal with the same attitude. He's now a full time student.<br />This book is the incredible story of his rich, not in money, but in more important things like love, pride in one's self, and life. The reason for Mr. Dawson's long life? I don't think it was anything as special as eating a certain way, or exercise per say, but it was love. Mr. Dawson loves life and it shines through every part of his life. There are wonderful life lessons are here for everyone; young, old, black, white, man or woman. A must read!	2002-01-18

When I was in 5th grade, I had a horrible teacher named Mrs. Aldridge.  Being only 10, I was still relatively optimistic.  The world had not yet made me cynical.  I still believed what my parents had always taught me, that I could do whatever I wanted if I set my mind on it.  Mrs. Aldridge taught me a good (or, rather, bad) lesson that led me to not believe this.  Growing up I had always wanted to be a writer.  The mere sight of a freshly sharpened pencil created a burning desire in me to put words to paper.  Mrs. Aldridge killed that desire in a matter of minutes.  Instead of nurturing and encouraging this desire, she criticized and ridiculed this student's early, unexperienced efforts.  The desire of that 10-year-old lay dead and buried for 13 years.<br />Anne Lamott's wonderful book, &quot;Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life,&quot; served to resurrect a bit of that lost desire.  Encouragement served with some laughter and a few tears, Lamott writes honestly about the writing life.  She pulls no punches when it comes to matters like publication and all the other highs and lows of a writers life.  She gives writing tips, inspiration and the amazing encouragement only a teacher of writing can.  Lamott's humor shines through and makes &quot;Bird by Bird&quot; a highly enjoyable, yet educational read.<br />And, sorry, Mrs. Alridge, but Ms. Lamott taught me something that you never could...to follow my heart and write because I enjoy it, whether I am ever published or not.  Because to do what you enjoy makes life worth living.  And I can do it, if I set my mind to it.	2002-01-08

With each word, sentence, phrase...it just keeps getting better.  Smith writes beautifully, her words magically making something out of the life of a child who could have been a nobody.  This story is moving and beautiful-a must read for anyone who loves books and an inspirational story.<br />The story follows the life of little Francie Nolan, poor child of a penniless singer-waiter-drunkard Johnny, and hardworking-penny pincher-beautiful Katie.  Francie is a smart child who loves to read.  Her life is by turns happy, sad, melancholy and poignant.  With parents determined to see her and her brother Neeley to do better in life than they did, she moves through school and into the working life of her teens.  Her life is never easy, but one of her best characteristics is her ability to find beauty is the smallest things.  One of my favorite examples of this is, upon a visit to the old, shabby library, she sees in a plain brown bowl &quot;...nasturtiums!  Red, yellow, gold, and ivory-white.  A head pain caught her between the eyes at the taking in of such a wonderful sigh.  It was something to be remembered all her life. (page, 21-chapter 2).&quot;<br />I laughed, cried and cheered with this tiny child, desperate to make something of herself and find love.  Smith gives the lives of these poor, desperate, sometimes even starving people a measure of pride and beauty that is unforgettable.	2001-12-03

McConnochie, taking what little is known about the three and reimagines their lives with this engrossing novel.<br />It is set on Coldwater, an island off the coast of Australia and home to a penal colony where their father is sort of the governor/prison warden. The sisters dream of being novelists and getting as far away from Coldwater as possible, where they are miserable. They decide to use their writing talents to earn money and help them to move back to England.<br />McConnochie tells the story through each characters eyes, switching narratives and at times even writing style. McConnochie does a great job, I think, of switching to each characters' unique personality. I can't say that I have read a lot of Bronte (I've only read Jane Eyre all the way through) but I think she may even switch writing style according to character because Charlotte and Emily's sections are in first person, while Anne's in third. An ambitious first novel, I think McConnochie handled it with style and I will definitely keep my eye out for more from her.	2001-11-05

Being the loving niece that I am - and knowing my crazy uncle like I do - I thought I would give &quot;A Walk In the Woods&quot; a read and pass it on to him to read if I thought it was good. Well, I'm going to get it for him for Christmas, definitely, and hope that it might make him think twice about his crazy idea.<br />The beauty of this book is the clear message that one must be very serious about hiking the AT, if one is to make the WHOLE very loooong hike. Mr. Bryson pulls no punches when it comes to the hardships of the AT. Mr. Bryson encounters bears, the occasional lost partner, snow, ice, rain, hunger, strange hikers appearing out of nowhere and doing the oddest things, and more as he winds his way up the trail from Georgia to Maine.<br />However, Mr. Bryson also gives great detail about the beauty and majesty of the glorious, and pitifully, rather ignored AT. I can definitely see myself taking day hikes to many of the splendid places along the trail that he describes. Many beautiful sites are described in loving detail - mountains, streams, and Mother Nature in all her glory.<br />There is much to be said about those brave enough to hike the whole thing. I definitely admire those who have taken it on and lived to tell the tale. &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot; is a witty, hilarious look at two regular guys and their misadventures along the adventures Appalacian Trail.	2001-09-26

It really emphasizes finding and using God's will in your life.  Sure, the writing and plot line were predictable, but that's not as important here as hearing the message of the story.  The characters are wonderfully thought out, I really cared about all of them by the end, and wished the book didn't have to end.  Really wonderful!	2001-09-20

If you like well thought out characters, interesting plots, good, concise writing...then don't buy this book!  It has a great premise, the old &quot;Choose your own adventure&quot; style of the good ole days, but don't be fooled.  The CYOA of the past was 100x better than this!  Short chapters, tiresome plots, and a boring premise (get laid in 24 hrs? is that all there is in life?) is all you will get with this book.  Save your money and get a real book.  Or heck, get a CYOA-the real kind.  They were much more interesting than this.	2001-09-17

Sadly, it did not.  The plot was weak and jumpy-darting from one place to the other so badly that I had to backtrack several times just to see where the narrative had moved too.  The characters were also weak, I never really cared about what happened to either the &quot;smart&quot; sister or the &quot;pretty&quot; one.  Just a jumbled jigsaw puzzle of a novel.	2001-09-16

In the tradition of &quot;Bridget Jones&quot; ms Kinsella has created another almost smart, british airhead who finds herself in crazy, improbable situations. Also like Bridget Jones, you can't help but like the story, as she looses all her money and credit, and has to work her way back to financial security. All the while her hair, clothes, and love life are much more important. At least she finds a financially stable man who seems to really care for her. This was a quick, cutesy read that I enjoyed despite myself.	2001-09-04

Twin brothers, Hector and Virgil, are virtually nothing alike except for one love-reading-own and operate their own B&amp;B where guests come to do nothing but read. The narrative goes back and forth between the two as they discuss guests, books and their lives. The most interesting parts are their book discussions-I found a few books I would like to try out myself. Otherwise, I found it rather unremarkable, but still pretty enjoyable.	2001-08-30

Rebecca Wells reads her wonderful story with wonderful effect. Each and every southern syllable is rich with detail and imagery. The narrative becomes even more hilarious as Wells imbodies her characters with their own distinct voice and style. My only complaint would be that since it was abridged, many of my favorite scenes from the book were cut, but who can really complain with this charmingly lady reading? A must listen for all fans of this book!	2001-08-29

In rich, stunning detail, Arthur Golden tells the story of a poor Japanese girl who is taken away to be a geisha. Her story is mesmerizing and deeply affecting. This book stayed with me for months and I already want to read it again. The characterization of Sayuri is amazing, I truly began to feel that I knew her well. Reading this book is like beautfiul a history lesson. Golden obviously knows his subject well and takes on the voice of a woman with satisfactory results. I learned a lot of things I never knew about the hard lives of the geishas. A very entertaining read that shouldn't be missed!	2001-08-29
US	52369410	R3W0OTXGGRA105	014100018X	598461998	Chocolat	Books	4	1	1	N	N	An interesting read	I found this to be an enjoyable read. It consideres the age old war between religion and humanity and what happens when the two clash. The man of religion, Father Reynaud , takes himself a little too seriously and fails to realize that life can't and shouldn't be made miserable by your beliefs. You have to celebrate them and who you are, or you are condemned to be miserable and alone. Viviane and her daughter Anouk may seem to represent temptation, but to me they represent life,-in particular life lived to the fullest. Father Reynaud tries to stamp out their influence on &quot;his&quot; town and extingish the fire they kindle in the hearts of many instead of embracing them like a true man of God should, with disasterous results-for him. The main lesson I got from this book is, no matter what your beliefs are you deserve to be happy in this life and to be able to live that life the way you want...and no one should be able to take that away from you. Beliefs and happiness should live in harmony together, not tear each other apart.	2001-08-29

(...)<br />I found myself hating Mama Elena for being so unfair and uncaring of her daughter Tita (and Rosaura, I mean, who asked her?).  However, the ridiculous turn the narrative took into such a fantastical world was just toooooo much.  It became totally surreal as Tita's feelings became cooked into her meals, affecting the characters who partook of her food in strange and downright weird ways.  I began to despise Tita for her ongoing obsession with Pedro and her treatment of poor Dr. John, who loved her so much (more than Pedro I think) and wasn't married to her sister either.  Pedro and Tita's \\"love\\" became more routine and something that they wanted more to spite her mother than the actual love they felt.  (...) I just couldn't take her anymore.  I had to force myself to finish, which I promptly regretted because I hated the ending the most.	2001-08-28

While still moderately enjoyable, she managed to irritate me with the heroine of this tale. While she seems to be a rather intelligent woman, the main character comes across more often than not as blind, deaf and dumb. In love with a man who will never love her the way she wants in return, she refuses to see it, hear it or believe that she has no chance with him, even to the point where she convinces him to conceive a child with her, hoping it will make him see what he is missing. Instead of feeling sorry for her, I wound up wanting to scream &quot;Wake up and smell the rejection, honey!&quot; I found this to be more frustrating than any other Berg book.	2001-08-28
US	52369410	R13UDG1H2C3VMO	0312195516	226874686	The Red Tent	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Interesting work	This is an interesting book historically and dramatically. The changes made by the author to the biblical story were daring, yet intriguing. Diamont takes the story of Dinah, daughter of Jacob, from Genesis and gives another possible version of how things could have happened. Diamont fleshes out this mysterious woman who is mentioned, what, once? and gives her a chance to speak for herself. The characterizations of the people involved in this story; Leah, Rachel, Zilpah and Bilnah in particular are obviously well thought out and extremely well researched. This book will give you an increased insight into, probably not Dinah, but the way people lived in these biblical times. An immensely enjoyable read.	2001-08-28
