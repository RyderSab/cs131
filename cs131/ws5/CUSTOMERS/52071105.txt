Maybe it was the tighter focus of those later books that didn't appeal to me as much. Whatever the reason, After the Quake is the man at his best. The stories are short and the book is overall a quick read, but that... density... is back. Each one bears re-reading. I still wouldn't recommend it as the best starting point (I for some reason always recommend Sheep Chase or Hardboiled for that), but still, great stuff.	2002-08-22

While I really didn't like The Lover of History, I loved The Liberty Campaign (also about advertising) and liked St. Famous. But Palladio is just not successful, for a number of reasons. For one, the female characters seem rather interchangable, which is a big pet peeve of mind. Another more basic issue, at least for me, is that the story just didn't seem plausible. It's difficult for me to believe that these &quot;revolutionary&quot; PR campaigns would've worked. Another reason that the novel failed for me was that Mal, the character who was supposed to be this fascinating enigma, was just a big yawn. Finally, I found the change in tense halfway through the novel distracting and fairly pointless. So a big Thumbs Down for this one. Read The Liberty Campaign instead	2002-04-29

The problem is, do you have the time/desire to wade through everything else that either  doesn't move you or does move you in a really negative way?

Pretty good stuff. This 2 hour, 2 cassette set, recorded at California's Esalen institute, is a pretty good primer (or refresher, depending on what you bring to it) for both Joyce's Wake and McLuhan's theories.  McKenna,  while managing to stay well clear of a full-blown rant, shines an interesting  psychedelia-flavored,  history-along-with-human-consciousness-is-compressing-itself-into-a-nutshell  light on the whole thing.  So what exactly is here? On the Joyce side: a pretty in-depth analysis of the  Wake's first five pages (much of this a distillation of Joseph Campbell's Skeleton Key). On the McLuhan side: a bare bones what-did-he-say-and-what-did-he-mean, with a little  boy-did-we-drop-him-faster-than-we-embraced-him lament.  The last word? It's about Joyce and by McKenna.

Henderson's protagonist, Eliot McGuire, is a recovering Hemingway scholar/alcoholic, and he's not only fallen, he's plummeted off the wagon on both counts. Stuck in the quagmire of negotiations with his publishing company for his barely cohesive life-improvement system, LifeForms, Eliot, hoping to sneak his way into their good graces, opts to do the company a quick favor by flying down to Key West to bid on the tell-all memoir by one &quot;Pappy&quot; Markham, a shadowy figure of the &quot;Lost Generation&quot; set, who claims that Hemingway died not by his own hand but rather by Pappy's shotgun, payback for plagaristic treachery supposedly committed by Hemingway long ago. Eliot soon finds that the supposed manuscript is no longer than a page, and takes the opportunity to ghostwrite this doubtful story for a quick buck. Henderson realizes the synergistic possibilities of his themes (the way men treat each other, the way the publishing world seems to mistreat everyone, the way everyone has treated Hemingway's legend to the exclusion of his real persona) and utilizes them to full effect. Bold posteuring gives way to deceitful maneuvering gives way to more success and more psychosis than Eliot ever bargained for.  An incredibly fun read	1997-01-30

Lipsky not only doesn't screw up either but also brilliantly juxtaposes the both. The story isn't really jampacked with event- Richard floats from father's home to mother's home, from art show to art show, from love to somewhere around the perimeter- but, it is packed with emotion and brilliantly nuanced prose, its wisdom dawning slowly but surely, for this is the way it occurs for our narrator as well. My own read on what that wisdom is exactly: that the ties between art and fame and celebrity and respect are strikingly similar to the ties that exist between the love and sense of respect and sense of duty that exist between parent and child. The reader shares Richard's own startled sense of wonder, at how these ties- ever tightening to the point of almost fraying at times, resembling more of a noose than a bond at other times- can still somehow survive. Remarkably poignant, without ever becoming the least bit schlocky. If you still think your mom is the coolest despite her weirdness, then by all means, read this	1997-01-27

With Brightness Falls, a beautiful multitextured flow was achieved. And then this.

I probably let too many writers slide on by on the strength ofthe cool idea alone. A few weeks short of New Year's, I will resolveto end this practice.  The problems inherent in Easy Travel to Other Planets (a book which, on the surface, concerns a scientist who is not only teaching a dolphin how to speak but also having sexual relations with it (!) and the wounded psyches that she calls her family and friends) could probably be summed up by the title, which, unless I'm an idiot, is never fully explained, and so I will have to use my incredible (ha ha) powers of deduction to infer that the intention of the use of this title was to refer to the feverish addiction to the future that we (meaning society as a whole) possess, future not necessarily referring to technology (although there is more than the occassional nod to this type of progress, chief among them talking dolphins and the infuriatingly underexplained &quot;information sickness&quot; which apparently runs rampant through the novel's time period (somewhere close to now). The novel's inhabitants are either formulating scientific hypotheses, tending to illnesses both physical and psychological (through physician-prescribed and self-medicating means), investing in race cars, or planning happy futures together (or apart), but they are very rarely focused on dealing concretely with the present, and this, Mooney seems to want to communicate, is part of what will lead to tragedy, on both societal and personal levels. The main problem here is that Mooney could have communicated all of this in a much stronger fashion (I know he COULD HAVE done it... the language occassionally flashes brilliantly with insight) but the novel as a whole, much like much of its characterization and plot's finale, come off as feeling like... there just could have been, and should have been, more.	1996-12-10

Wright seems to run into the same problem Oliver Stone did with Natural Born Killers (the parallels plagued me through the entire novel): how do you comment on the numbing quality of a violence-saturated American media and culture without numbing your own audience in the process?  Wright's scope is almost too large, and in his attempts to touch upon everything and connect with everyone, he becomes.... un-crafty, not sly. His stylistic gambits come off as obvious, especially the attempt to make the prose &quot;hallucinatory&quot;.  It couldn't have been more obvious that that was his desire if he had stamped &quot;HALLUCINATORY&quot; in red across every page.  You want hallucinatory and interconnected?

There are common themes here, sure, but for this reader, Barth's talent ensures that the style transcends gimmick.  The story never gets too horribly muckied up while he plays around.

Thus goes the line from &quot;Heroin&quot;, by the Velvet Underground, the song from which Denis Johnson borrowed the title for this interconnected connection.  The title seems to be not the only Velvet-like trait here.  The writing is spare and moody, banging away again and again at themes of physical, mental and spiritual isolation. But for some reason, Johnson doesn't strike the chord with the same intensity as the Underground.  There is nothing wrong, per se, with the language. It is, in fact, finely crafted at many points, but overall, it just doesn't do it for me.  Johnson's work reminds me of that of Dennis Cooper.  If his topics click with you, then yahoo, you've got a lot of solid work to read, but if it doesn't, then perhaps you should start packing your bags, because the scenery doesn't change much.

Woe to the man who tries to neatly summarize the plot to Circus of the Earth and the Air.  Where do you start?  With what you think happened? With what the narrator thinks happens?  Remember the last time you took way too much cold medicine and could have sworn your mom was walking through walls and your dog had turned into a flying monkey?  Welcome back to that state of mind. Opening on a deserted beach, Stevens quickly takes us to the circus, where popcorn is purchased and wives are lost.  From there, onto a mysterious island-based military fortress, where that wife may or may not be.  To his credit, Stevens never creates a dull moment.  The pace is furious, and the barely buried psychological implications are immense.  On the minus side, Stevens does not rank up there as a writer with one of the prettiest styles I've ever encountered.  At more than one point, the language seems functional at best.  One is reminded of an old cliffhanger series.  Some parts are more than a little implausible, even a bit corny, yet you HAVE TO know how it all turns out.

What I will grant Mr. Kiteley is that the basic idea of this novel is wonderful.  In summary, a middled-aged amateur entymologist frames the episodes of his life with entries from his field journal.  My specific difference with the authors who add their support to the novel (among them, Rick Bass) is that the size of the novel is in fact not its strength but rather a dissapointment.  Clocking in at significantly less than 200 pages, segments that seem that they should simply add color are forced to be narrative centerpieces, and the result is that they feel slight.  I found myself wishing for Kiteley's scope to become a bit more panoramic.  I realize that, as the title suggests, the size and focus are most likely highly intentional, yet at novel's end, I came away not with some feeling of resolution or progress but rather a heightened sense of limbo.  Given more breathing room, Kiteley could have quite likely made me care about this character a great deal.  Instead, I felt as if a stranger on the street bumped into me, and before I could figure out whether or not I knew him, he was gone	1996-11-18

David Foster Wallace, Michael Chabon, Jonathan Franzen.... and now Stephen McCauley.  For me, The Easy Way Out was one of those books that brought with it a certain amount of sorrow when I had finished it. I could never have the experience of reading it for the first time again!  By delving into the lives of Patrick's bitterly married parents, his recently separated brother Ryan, his player brother Tony, his live-in lover Arthur, his non-live-in lover Jeffrey, and his best friend and travel agent extraordinaire, Sharon, McCauley manages to show not only the irony and hipocrisy of our actions but also highlight the love that runs through the bunch regardlessly.  This is an author who capital R respects his characters, allowing them to only move by their agendas, never the author's.  What also struck me about this book is that in dealing with a tale focused around the best way to deal with the truth, McCauley doesn't take the easy way out (pun intended) and write a coming-out story.

Antrim makes his art like he observes his life: contradictions galore.  Mr. Robinson's loyalty to his wife and to his ideals regarding education don't seem as if they should fit within the general paranoid isolative nature of his community, and yet they do, in a very real way.  Mr. Robinson attempts to make a real difference in his community while neighbors build vastly deep moats equipped with lethal spikes to surround their homes. There is a haunting similarity to the entire town's psyche here in this image, and Mr. Robinson is not immune to this.  Characters seem to proceed with a wide knowledge of life and its intricacies, yet are unable to make the connections between things: to see how interest can breed obsession, how love can inspire violence.  There exists the danger of falling through these cracks and understanding and this is indeed what happens. The novel creeps toward an unsettling climax that you always know in the back of your mind is coming, yet can't quite let yourself believe it to be true. The cliched neighbor response to the latest small town horror on the six o'clock news comes to mind.  &quot;He seemed like a nice man.  The perfect neighbor.  Basically kept to himself.&quot; &quot;Elect Mr. Robinson For A Better World&quot; is touching and unsettling in the way that little art is and most life can be. Despite jacketflap trumpeting, few novelists seem willing to be brave enough to address the pockets of darkness that exist in the well-lit homes of the upper middle class.  Don't expect the feel good book of the year, but if you're looking for something thought-provoking, this might very well be what you need to read.	1996-11-15
