Mainly, they blow stuff up and wreck machines, but they have a fun time doing it.<br />In \\"Hayduke Lives!,\\" the sequel to that book, Edward Abbey returns to those characters and tries to stir them up to action once again, this time with the threat of a giant bulldozer about to destroy a beautiful canyon.<br />Yeah....<br />First of all, do not read this until you've read \\"The Monkey Wrench Gang\\" first.  And even then, think about it carefully before reading this half-formed, rambling, disappointing sequel.<br />I loved \\"The Monkey Wrench Gang\\"--I've read it multiple times--and so the first fifty pages or so of this were just a lot fun to me, being reunited with the characters from that book.<br />But then, the story never really goes anywhere.  The novel constantly digresses to describe sex scenes or Earth First! rallies, and it's not until page 270(!) of a 307-page novel that the four original members of the Monkey Wrench Gang finally reunite.<br />The book rambles on in an unfocused way that damages the characters that were so nicely formed in the first book, constantly digresses, and ultimately, unfortunately, becomes much more violent than \\"The Monkey Wrench Gang\\" ever did.<br />The writing is occassionally good--sometimes even great--and some of the scenes are exciting, but none of it ever goes anywhere.  There are too many characters and not enough character development, and the whole thing with the bulldozer comes across as lame and cheesy, especially when the first book set up their next goal to be something much bigger and more exciting--the destruction of Glen Canyon Dam.<br />Read this only if you absolutely LOVED \\"The Monkey Wrench Gang,\\" but even then, be warned that this might dampen your enthusiasm even for that book.  It's pretty disappointing, especially coming from an author that we all know was capable of much, much better.le of much, much better.	2005-10-11

I've never been able to change the things this book drove me to do, the places it drove me to go to, the roads it drove me to hitchhike, or the desperate search for experience it made me embark on.<br /><br />Even today--marrried, and with a kid--whenever I pick up this book (or Kerouac's \\"The Dharma Bums\\")--my mind starts to drift toward lonely roads across Nevada and Alaska and Mexico that I haven't yet travelled, toward mountains I haven't yet camped on, and toward people I haven't yet met.  I open its pages, and I can't resist the excitement it has for life or the world it offers to me.<br /><br />And I'm glad.<br /><br />I'm glad I can't purge those inclinations or those feelings, and I'm glad it still has this effect on me.<br /><br />\\"On the Road\\" is a timeless book, in its powerful, alive writing, and in the pure voice of its author: a confused guy who wasn't confused about what mattered the most: about how intensely (very intensely) he should let the world flood his soul.

It's brilliant, and it contains some of Dostoyevsky's finest writing.  A passage in which the book's protagonist walks into a room and then into a girl's eyes springs immediately to mind, and has stayed with me ever since I first read this book years ago.<br /><br />And, unlike Dostoyevksy's more widely read works, in this book, Dostoyevsky often takes the opportunity to digress from the novel's story and tell his personal opinions on what he's writing about, whether the subject be an event in the story or a particular theme the author feels strongly about.  These digressions present a great opportunity for the reader to really get to know this amazing writer.<br /><br />But the story and the characters are reasons enough to give this book a go, preferably after first reading \\"The Brothers Karamazov,\\" \\"Crime and Punishment,\\" or some of Dostoyevky's shorter works.<br /><br />It's a great book, very rewarding, and well worth your time.	2005-10-08

Because of its short length, or maybe because of its light tone, it's not usually considered among Dostoyevky's best or most famous works, but the novel is full of tense moments, great humor, unbelievable yet classic characters, and a number of conversations that will actually make you angry--conversations between the leech of a visitor and his meek though gracious patron.<br /><br />I've read almost all of Dostoyevky's works, and this has always stuck out to me as one of his most enjoyable.  I've read it multiple times.<br /><br />I think he was really having fun when he wrote this one, and it shows in every page.  Read it, for sure.	2005-10-08

She finds a handful of words that perfectly suit this terrain and the life it supports--words like white, slant, tilt, sessile, and winey--and bends and twists these words every way possible to serve her every purpose.<br /><br />As a result, the land she describes comes across vividly.  She writes of how the desert and the wilderness \\"uncramps our souls,\\" of \\"the days too hot and white,\\" of slant-winged scavengers,\\" of wandering hopelessly through the desert trodding on vultures' shadows, of \\"the westering sun,\\" \\"the late slant light,\\" of \\"a stream that knows its purpose and reflects the sky,\\" and of the sun dancing up the slope of a mountain.<br /><br />Her prose is KILLER.<br /><br />She also tells firsthand accounts of Death Valley's craziest miners, of little towns that could (kind of, sometimes), and of such sad sights as a cougar lamenting the destruction of its lair and family that had been destroyed by a torrential rainstorm, \\"crying a very human woe.\\"  In another such rainstorm she talks of \\"a bobcat mother mouthing her drowned kittens in the ruined lair built in the wash....\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.  It's very brief, and is plotless, but the insights and descriptions are invaluable.  I've never been to Death Valley, but I'm already planning on going there.<br /><br />If the book has faults though, it's in some of the generalizations it makes about the area's people (All Spanish people dance and sing every evening?

Man.<br /><br />\\"The American Way of Death\\" is a no holds barred look at the American funeral industry--at an industry that (for the most part) bases its income on exploiting the grief of people who have just lost their loved ones.  The book makes this industry seem so overwhelmingly sinister that it's almost unbelievable, yet the author quotes crebile sources and probes all the important questions.<br /><br />I first read this book in 2001, right before my older sister died.  My dad was in the process of arranging my sister's funeral and burial, and I told him about this book and to be careful in dealing with the morticians (oh, sorry, the \\"funeral directors\\") and other funeral industry people, but he was too griefstricken to pay me much attention, and I didn't want to be rude when he was so traumatized over the death of his daughter.<br /><br />So, my dad went to a Utah funeral home, and the people there capitalizing on his uncontrollable, unthinking, heartbroken grief and his desire to do only the best for his daughter and his daughter's memory--\\"Of course you want only the best for her, right sir?\\"--bought an expensive coffin, an expensive tombstone, an uneccesary underground vault, a \\"memorial bench\\"(!), and NINETEEN (19!) CEMETARY PLOTS since of course every one of my sister's friends and family members would of course want to be buried in some cruddy Provo, Utah cemetary (excuse me, \\"memorial park\\").<br /><br />My dad didn't have that kind of money! And he would barely realize what he'd done until years later.<br /><br />I've seen the funeral industry's greedy exploitation in action.  This book tells the truth, and though it's a sad truth, the author makes it entertaining and even funny.  It's a book everyone should read, because eventually, we're all going to die.  You included--so you might as well fork out the cash for a copy of this.  You won't be sorry you did.	2005-10-07

Hate them.<br /><br />My parents and siblings practically insisted I read Stephen Covey's jargon-rich \\"The Seven Habits...\\" and I got as far as something about the \\"P/PC principle\\" before deciding I'd had too much.  Just seeing print ads for \\"Who moved my cheese?\\" makes me want to vomit.<br /><br />That said, this is not really a business book.  It's a book about truly being a better person, and by being a better person, being a better spouse, parent, boss, friend, citizen, and employee.  The whole concept of the book is one simple idea: treat people as if they're people, not as if they're objects.<br /><br />Some car cuts you off in traffic?<br /><br />Get mad!<br /><br />No.  A car didn't cut you off.  A person did.  Why?  Why would a person do that?  Have YOU yourself ever cut someone off?  You did?  Why did you?<br /><br />\\"Well, I was in a hurry.  I was late for an appointment....\\"<br /><br />Well, maybe that guy was too....<br /><br />Using this simple approach, the world can be a much nicer place, you can spend a lot less time being angry or frustrated, and you could end up liking people a lot more.<br /><br />Unlike books like \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People,\\" this book is not about tricks, or flattery, or social politics.  It's about truly seeing people as real individuals, and then, it doesn't matter what you need to say to them, as long as they can tell you realize they're a real human being with real needs and concerns.  Because to truly see someone, is to truly value them.<br /><br />This book isn't perfect--it uses some pretty fruity terminology at times, its format of a boss talking with an employee is a little cheesy, and it ends abruptly--but it could change your life nonetheless. One reviewer said, \\"Upon finishing this book, I felt like Ebeneezer Scrooge on Christmas morning,\\" and I'd have to agree.<br /><br />In fact, I'm going to re-read it, and get that feeling back again.	2005-10-07

It's about how this philosophy doesn't hold up once he actually goes through with the murder, and about the horrible physical and psychologial effects that commiting such a violent crime has on the young man's mind.<br /><br />The book does an excellent job of getting the reader inside the main character's head, and as you read you'll find yourself rooting for him, for this murderer who just killed two people.  It's unbearably suspenseful at times.<br /><br />The book examines crime, morality, repentance, and the theory that maybe there are people who can commit crimes without the crimes being wrong as long as those people are mentally strong enough--people like Napoleon.<br /><br />The book's characters are excellently drawn, and the story is much more focused and directed and streamlined than \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" or \\"The Idiot.\\"<br /><br />I've read this book multiple times, and every time I've found something new in it.  Like many of Dostoyevsky's books, it's like an entire world that can never be completely explored--and it's a world worth exploring.	2005-10-07

One night, a girl comes in with a book about how she hates the attention her gorgeous body brings her; she and the main character have sex, become boyfriend and girlfriend, and she gets pregnant.  They decide to get an abortion, and arrange to go to Mexico to do so.<br /><br />The book, although casual in its treatment of abortion--including fetuses being flushed down toilets--does meditate a little bit on what was being lost, when somehow the couple's aborted baby, all grown up, shows up one night with a book full of blank pages, pages never written on, pages she never had a chance to write on.  (Richard Brautigan's ambivalence on this subject is also reflected in his poem \\"The Pill Versus the Springhill Mining Disaster,\\" where he compares birth control and a fatal mine collapse, and says something like:<br /><br />\\"All those people...lost inside.\\")<br /><br />Richard Brautigan really is a funny guy, though.  He's also very much a child of the 1960s, and both his humor and his sixties idealism come through strong in this book.<br /><br />The main girl has sex with someone she just met, gets an abortion, works at a topless place, and is perfectly happy.<br /><br />The main guy arranges the abortion, quits his job, lives off his girlfriend, and is perfectly happy.<br /><br />Politics aside, 1960s aside, this is an enjoyable read, though it ends on a somewhat disappointing note, and any suspense it maintains ends abruptly upon the couple's actual visit to the abortion doctor.<br /><br />I laughed uncomfortably several times while reading it, but would probably recommend \\"Trout Fishing in America\\" over this.	2005-10-07

I mean...wow.<br /><br />All over the Deep South there are snake handling churches--groups that get together in weird little shacks, play loud electric rock and roll, and drape poisonous snakes around their necks and arms; they use the snakes to wipe the sweat from their foreheads, and walk along them like balancing beams.  There's a verse in the Bible about how people with enough faith shall be able to trod on serpents without any harm, and these people take it literally.  They also drink poison and put their hands on hot stoves, and usually, their faith or the power of their minds or something actually keeps them from being hurt.<br /><br />This book is a wild look at an insane and fascinating religious sect, and the author writes about it well.  During his investigations, he finds out his grandfather was an early snakehandler, and the author decides to try snakehandling himself.  As a result, the story doesn't stay objective, but it stays more than plenty interesting.<br /><br />This is among the most gripping and interesting pieces of nonfiction I've ever read, and I would highly recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />Also, if you stole a hiker's backpack from alongside a highway near Jasper, Georgia in 2001, please send me back the copy of \\"Salvation on Sand Mountain\\" that was in its top pouch.

The photos are all from the brothers' road trips across the U.S., but the stories of these trips aren't really here.  Instead, the brothers pair each photos with a quote, in the classic Sierra Club style.  Many of the quotes are from famous works, many are from the brothers themselves.  Some don't make sense at all, such as a quote from a deer that's somehow multiple millennia old.  Hmmm.<br /><br />The book does have a GREAT photo of a girl looking sadly at a rising Lake Powell/flooding Glen Canyon, and a good section on Glen Canyon in general.  However, I wish the book had more on the brothers' actual story, as the photos of them look intriguing, and the book's afterward mentions that one of the brothers died shortly before the book's initial publication.<br /><br />I recommend this for Glen Canyon scholars, those interested in the Sierra Club and this century's environmenal movement and grainy sixties imagery, but I don't see how it's the life changing book that some people say it is.

It was one of the most gripping pieces of nonfiction I've ever read, and because I've loved and listened to Wilco since their first album, it was like reading about old friends.<br /><br />My younger brother said the same thing.<br /><br />The book is well written, the story of the band and of Uncle Tupelo (the band before Wilco) is clearly plotted and unfolded, and every band member (with the exception of the newest additions) is clearly described and given background.<br /><br />The book answers many questions, provides new insight on the band's lyrics, and tells quite a bit about the band's backgrounds and influences, both personal and musical.<br /><br />I would have like something on Natalie Merchant's role in Wilco's Mermaid Avenue recordings, on Jay Farrar after Uncle Tupelo, more on Jeff Tweedy's family life, and a less critical view of Wilco's \\"A.M.\\" and the Loose Fur side project, but overall this book was a great read.

In that case, both maps will fail you, you will make the mistake of using a windmill for a landmark--there are dozens--and you will drive around until you run out of gas.  You'll have fun though.)	2005-10-06

Apparently, I must be somewhat weird, because this last Christmas, I was given four copies of this book by four different people.  (And then, coincidentally, three of my friends got this book for their birthdays....)<br /><br />This book is loaded with weird facts, legends, lore, people, photographs, ghost stories, haunted places, supernatural figures, terrifying ruins and tunnels and forests and abandoned buildings, tall tales, odd museums, and answerless mysteries.<br /><br />I've travelled a lot around America, and I've come across a lot of strangeness that's not in this book--I always ask people, \\"What's the strangest thing you've ever seen?\\"--but what it is here is entertaining and unique, if occasionally doubtful.  The book deals more with the East than with the West, and as a result of that a lot of cool stuff is never even mentioned that could be.  There's only one or two items from New Mexico, and nothing at all on skinwalkers--the creepiest lore there is.<br /><br />Some parts of the book are actually frightening though--like phantom clowns!--and would be even scarier if read during an actual visit to these places.<br /><br />I recommend this book highly--it's very readable, though I wish it had maps or directions to the places it describes--and I will probably buy any sequels.	2005-10-06

It's also well indexed and can be easily used as a reference.  It's one of Stegner's best, for sure.	2005-10-06

The book excels at its account of John Wesley Powell's life AFTER his famous trips down the Colorado River, and does a great job of describing Powell's role in the battle against over-populating the West.<br /><br />If the book has faults though, they lie in that many of Stegner's sources have since been expounded upon or dismissed entirely, and so the facts in this book aren't entirely current.  Also, Stegner dismisses too quickly the merits of the story of James White, a man who very possibly went down the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon two years before Powell did.<br /><br />And, it's kind of ridiculous how Stegner criticizes Powell's second expedition's photos as if they were famous works and art: This photo \\"is marred by too much nondescipt low-water beach in the foreground,\\" and that sort of thing.<br /><br />This is a great book for anyone interested in John Wesley Powell or the Colorado River.  It's possibly Stegner's best nonfiction work, though \\"Mormon Country\\" is good as well.<br /><br />For another great account of John Wesley Powell, read \\"Down the Great Unknown\\" by Edward Dolnick.<br /><br />Or, for a half-decent book about Wallace Stegner's peculiarly white view of the American West, read, \\"'Why I Can't Read Wallace Stegner' and Other Essays\\" by Elizabeth Cook-Lynn.  That one's kind of interesting.	2005-10-06

Where \\"In Cold Blood\\" had plot and force and direction, this book has poetry, mood, and mystery.  Where \\"In Cold Blood\\" had characters, this has atmosphere.<br />They're very different books, and probably shouldn't even be compared.<br />This book does have good characters though, though their relationships with each other don't evolve in the way you might hope they would.  The characters include a young boy come to meet his long lost father, a girl that's full of life but socially awkward, and a cousin whose motives are hard to define and suspicicous though tender.<br />And it also has plot, but it's a low, meandering plot that doesn't pay off in any sort of traditional way.<br />What the book really has plent of is SETTING.  The book's setting is alive, though--a remote mansion in a quiet corner of the Deep, decaying South...full of sinister old invalids, bird-killing women, and potentially pedophiliac cousins.  Everyone's a mystery, everyone's relations to everyone else is a mystery, and the story plunges the reader into a sort of pleasureful confusion that it never really attempts to take you back out of.<br />So, it's cool if you like that sort of thing.	2005-10-06

It's nicely organized town by town (though it doesn't have an index), and though it's fairly deferential to the area--as if it was written by the Alaska Bureau of Tourism--it's not afraid to tell about things like the whorehouse that was until very recently right outside of Soldotna.<br /><br />It's full of good photos and, though it sometimes feels like a magazine in book form, is a very nice volume for fans of the Kenai to buy and treasure.<br /><br />I've been researching a book that I want to write on Soldotna, Alaska, and the information in this book was very helpful to me.

In central New Mexico lies the mostly dirt La Madera Road.  The woods road.

(At least it was until someone started sneakily paving small sections of it.  Where will this end?)<br />Along La Madera Road, there are all kinds of amazing ghost towns: Hagan (this map's namesake), Tejon (an old Spanish town with an unbelievable history), Coyote, Tonque (a brick factory), Una de Gato, and La Madera itself.  Nearby it is also the still inhabited Puertocito, and several ruins that may have never had names.  There are two old cemetaries, thousands of arroyos, giant cottonwoods, a waterfall, gorgeous views, abandoned mines, tamarisk groves, and much more.<br />This map is a detailed key to all of them.

The book, \\"The Book of Mormon,\\" told the story of two cultures, the Nephites and the Lamanites, that lived in the Americas during the time of Christ, and claimed that Jesus had appeared to those cultures after his resurrection.  (Many Mormons believe today's Native Americans are the descendants of those cultures.)<br /><br />Joseph Smith said he received the book after he prayed to find out which church to join, and that God and Jesus Christ appeared to him themselves and told him not to join any of them.  The Mormon Church grew quickly, with Joseph Smith as its leader, but as it grew, it gained enemies.  People resented Joseph Smith's claims, covered him in tar and feathers, and violently tormented his followers.  The Mormons moved from place to place: to Ohio, to Missouri, and to Illinois, building settlements and towns, and fleeing when enraged mobs burnt down the Mormons' homes and churches or massacred the Mormon men and boys.  The Governor of Missouri went as far as issuing a military order for the complete extermination or deportation of every Mormon within his state.  Eventually, Joseph Smith was assassinated by a mob, through the windows of an Illinois prison, where he was being held for ordering the destruction of the printing presses of an anti-Mormon newspaper.<br /><br />Most people thought Joseph's Smith death would be the end of the Mormons, but it merely made him a martyr for his people.  Brigham Young, a tough, fiery-tempered man, became the Mormons' second leader--their second prophet--and in the mid-1800s, led the Mormons westward, toward what was then Mexican territory, and is now the state of Utah.  The Mormons traveled in covered wagons, or pulled wooden handcarts, and large numbers of them died from cold, hunger, sickness, and Indian attacks.  Along the way they built towns and outposts, and gave English names to the mountains and rivers.<br /><br />This book is the story of that journey, and it's a well told account of it.  The book is full of beautiful and historic photos, as well as copies of letters and journal entries, and a good narrative that ties it all together and injects new and little known facts into a story familiar to many.  This is a great book for any interested in the history of the West.  It seems objective, though it comes from a Mormon-owned publishing company, and it's never boring.  It's one of the best books on the Mormon pioneers I've ever read, and I recommend it highly.overed wagons, or pulled wooden handcarts, and large numbers of them died from cold, hunger, sickness, and Indian attacks.

As he was hiking solo (without having told anyone where he was) through the lonely Blue John Canyon, a boulder fell onto his arm, and trapped him there for six entire days--with no warm clothing, and very little food and water--until he discovered how to break the bones in his trapped forearm, sever his arm's skin and muscles and tendons and veins, and escape his horrible trap without his right hand.<br /><br />It's a gruesome, suspensful story, and an amazing adventure, but the book could have been been much shorter, much more concise, and much faster-paced.<br /><br />For the first half of the book, the author repeatedly interrupts the flow of the narrative to flash back to previous camping and mountaineering trips he'd taken.  No doubt this is to show he's an experienced outdoorsman, and not just some foolhardy kid that headed off into a canyon alone, but what it ends up feeling like (despite him attributing the idea for the antilinear structure of the story to Quentin Tarantino) is a long and monotonous list of EVERY CAMPING TRIP HE'D EVER TAKEN, when what I really wanted to hear about was him being stuck in a canyon with a  boulder on his arm.<br /><br />He also talks a lot about all the hippy jam band concerts he'd been to--Phish, the String Cheese Incident, other such awfulness--and even goes as far as quoting irrelevant Phish lyrics for PAGES.  If you, like I do, think these bands suck, and that most of their fans are unwashed stoners, then his repeated talk about this aspect of his life can seem a little alienating.  The quotes at the starts of each chapter are often pretty dumb as well, ranging from \\"The Matrix III\\" to Horace.<br /><br />Halfway through the book however, things pick up, and what had been a one to two star book improves drastically.  Instead of alternately telling about his camping trips, he begins telling about the rescue efforts going on to find him.  That's much more interesting, and even touching to see how affected his mother and friends are.<br /><br />The story's tense gets a little weird here, telling something that happened at the same time as Aron's entrapment (which is told in present tense) in past tense, and the chapters describing the conversations of his worried friends and family feature nothing but dialogue-strictly-for-the-sake-of-exposition type dialogue.  It's very clunky.<br /><br />His escape and rescue however are terrific: jubilant and touching, as is his reintegration back into real not-trapped-beneath-a-boulder life.  It's even kind of funny at times, such as when his sister asks him, \\"Hey Aron, do you need a hand?\\"<br /><br />Overall, this is an amazing story; however, it could have used a lot more editing, a lot more focus on the actual story, about a hundred fewer pages, and honestly, a ghostwriter.camping trips, he begins telling about the rescue efforts going on to find him.

Many of their finds are in this book.<br /><br />\\"Ghosts of Glen Canyon\\" is not a complete record, but it doesn't profess to be.  It's merely a very simple attempt to give visitors to Lake Powell a basic idea of what's beneath them.  Use it with Gary Topping's very complete \\"Glen Canyon and the San Juan Country.\\"  Use it as a guide, and use it as a reference--it works well for both...though I've often wished it had a better index.	2005-10-05

I'm not great, but I'm okay!" --The Sound of Mountain Water, after a bad fall	Oh, what do we have here?<br /><br />Oh, it's a cute, little, cute book.<br /><br />Why, it's a collection of essays by noted writer Wallace Stegner!<br /><br />Oh, how adorable!<br /><br />Hmmm.  I don't know, what can I say about another bunch of essays by Wallace Stegner?  The thought of writing about them just kind of depresses me.  I mean, the book is fine, for what it is, but it's not that exciting.  It's another nature writer writing about the West, another collection of essays, and another book that just kind of IS.  It's not great, it's not bad, it just is.<br /><br />You might like its essay on southern Utah's Glen Canyon filling with water (Lake Powell) after the construction of Glen Canyon Dam.  That's nice, and good enough that it's been reprinted many times in many books because of its statement that Lake Powell's Escalante Arm--where the Escalante River used to be--should be banned to powerboats.<br /><br />Or, you might like its account of the trading posts and Navajo Rodeo near Lees Ferry in northern Arizona, or the account of hiking and rafting the San Juan River, but the essay on the billboards of New Mexico is just kind of dumb, and several others just didn't do much for me.<br /><br />Read it if you want to.  You'll find some good things in it, especially if you're a Western historian or obsessed with Glen Canyon, but don't expect anything too wonderful.<br /><br />Expect papercuts.	2005-10-05

Whether or not you live in Utah, this book is an outstanding collection of random weirdness.  It's fascinating and at times unbelievable.  Sadly, its author died in a tragic car accident about a decade ago, but this book will forever remain a testament to his adventurous and inquisitive life.<br /><br />(And sadly, he will never be able to write companion books for Arizona and New Mexico.  Oh, what the world has lost!)<br /><br />This book is FULL of fascinating stuff: ghost towns, lost mines, treasure lore, and crazy history.  It's well organized into sections of the state, has maps, has a ton of entries and a ton of information, and even has a good index (though it doesn't have list any sources or references).<br /><br />The stories inside are facinating, ranging from the legend of the Golden Jesus--a three-foot-tall golden crucifix stolen by Hopis from the Spanish in the 1880s--the Lost Josephine Mine of the Henry Mountains, strange mining stories of the San Juan River, and many, many more.<br /><br />If the book has any faults, it's that the author takes evident liberties in telling the stories of these towns and mines treasures.  He comes across as more of a campfire yarn-spinner than a historian, and though this makes the book very entertaining, it also makes the book questionable as a source for reference material.<br /><br />Buy it anyway, though.  It's a lot of fun.	2005-10-05

It's very, very basic, with each chapter describing and explaining a particular sort of canyon or rock formation, yet it's also full of complicated geologic concepts explained clearly and precisely.<br /><br />It also contains many helpful illustrations.<br /><br />The book explores the ceaselessness of geology, the ever-changing state of the world's most basic components, and contains chapters on mesas, buttes, canyons, badlands, arroyos, spires, monuments, natural bridges, arches, dunes, volcanoes, petrified trees, fossils, meteors, and even the effects of prehistoric tribes on area geology.  (Have you ever noticed that wherever there's an Anasazi rock house, the entire area has been picked clean of any rock smaller than a boulder?)<br /><br />This is \\"The Elements of Style\\" for geology, and could be an indispensable tool for anyone smart enough to buy a copy.	2005-10-05

In case you don't know, \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" is the story of three brothers and their cruel, worthless father.  One of the brother's is a monk, trying to overcome his passions.  Another is a nihilist intellectual, and another is a wild partier.  One represents the spirit, one represents the mind, and one represents the flesh.<br /><br />The brothers' father is a lascivious drunk with no morals, and all of the brothers have at least a decent reason or two to kill him, or to allow him to be killed.  When the father is mysteriously murdered one night, all the brothers--especially one--are suspected to be guilty of the man's murder in one way or another, and the story explodes from there.<br /><br />Dostoyevsky was one of the greatest writers to have ever lived, and his treatment of these characters--and of the story's lesser characters--makes them all seem like real people you would like to meet.  The story abounds with beautiful insights, great writing, precise psychological profiles, and an ending almost guaranteed to leave you in a spiritual and physical euphoria.<br /><br />The book is not as streamlined as \\"Crime and Punishment,\\" there are some loose threads that Dostoyevsky would probably have tied up if he'd lived to write the second volume he'd planned, and occasionally Dostoyevsky's racism against Polish and Jewish people sneaks through, but the better qualities of this book eclipse its faults.  The book is incredibly readable, fun, deep, often funny, and interesting--and it gets better with every read.<br /><br />Sometimes I think it's my very favorite book.  Other times I KNOW it is.	2005-10-04

The mountain is the highest point of the entire Navajo Nation, 10,388 feet above sea level, and five thousand feet above the surrounding area.  It rises over a thousand horizons of mesas, buttes, cliffs, and other abnormalities.<br /><br />On one of the mountain's flanks, there is a small town--the community of Navajo Mountain itself.  That's what this book's about.<br /><br />In the town there's an abandoned stone school, a chapter house (or town hall), a few shack-like churches, countless scattered homes, and the gray brick buildings of the old, shutdown Navajo Mountain Trading Post.  The trading post once served as the center of activity around Navajo Mountain; people used to go there to buy flour and sugar and coffee, sell their rugs and nuts and jewelry, and wash their clothes in coin-operated washing machines, but it's been closed down since 1990.<br /><br />Now, no stores are open in Navajo Mountain anymore, and people drive a long, badly graded dirt road an hour and a half to Page, Arizona to shop, or more than fifty miles south to a gas station-grocery store known as Tonalea, Arizona, where there's also a post office.  Navajo Mountain has no hospital or police station, either--the closest ones are in Tuba City, Arizona, eighty-five miles away--and because of its isolation it's perfect for an anthropological study, perfect to be the subject of a book like this.<br /><br />Navajo Mountain used to be considered the most isolated town in the lower forty-eight states.  In the late-1920s a road was built to it against the strong wishes of many local Navajos, but the town is still considered the most isolated town in the Navajo Nation.  Many of the town's people are descendants of Navajos that escaped or survived the infamous Long Walk that was designed to relocate and to break the will of the West's Navajos.<br /><br />The few that escaped the Long Walk were led by a rebellious Navajo sheepherder named Hoskininni, \\"the Angry One,\\" and those few hid in the canyons beneath Navajo Mountain for years, foraging for plants, hunting for mountain sheep, and laying low.  Any white prospectors that wandered into the area during that time mysteriously disappeared--Hoskininni didn't like visitors--and the Navajos believed themselves to be protected by the twin gods Monster Slayer and Born-for-Water, and by the spirit of Navajo Mountain herself.  They were the start of the Navajo Mountain community.<br /><br />This book is a fascinating account of the area, of Hoskininni's descendants, and of the town.  The book is unfortunately dense with esoteric anthropological terms, but used in conjunction with Karl Luckert's \\"Navajo Mountain and Rainbow Bridge Religion,\\" it can be a very valuable resource, full of great stories, and fascinating information on skinwalkers, Navajo history, Paiute-Navajo relations, folklore, and the role of traditional Navajos in a modern world.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for anyone interested in any of the above.of the West's Navajos.   <br />The few that escaped the Long Walk were led by a rebellious Navajo sheepherder named Hoskininni, \\"the Angry One,\\" and those few hid in the canyons beneath Navajo Mountain for years, foraging for plants, hunting for mountain sheep, and laying low.

It's thorough, has a huge variety of entries, contains information I've found nowhere else, and is well worth paying for for any fan of the West, of the Four Corners states, and of Utah in particular.<br />Its entries on various mountain ranges, mines, periods of history, Indian tribes, historical personages, legends, towns, cities, controversies, scandals, religious movements, and area wildlife are thorough, fascinating, good reading.<br />Each entry is written by a different western writer, and so the entries read like spellbinding (though fact-filled) stories, not like boring, dry, textbook accounts.<br />Some of the entries, however--such as the entry on missing 1934 artist-photographer Everett Ruess--were not fact-checked well enough, and so constitute the book's only weaknesses.<br />Overall though, the book is worth any price you could pay for it.

It needs better editing, and is somewhat basic, but it's a good read for someone who wants to familiarize themselves with the subject but doesn't want an assault of information.<br /><br />The Hole-in-the-Rock Expedition was a two-mile-long caravan of horse-drawn Mormon wagons and livestock that travelled across the West in the 1870s, on the way to establish a new settlement in the untamed, southeast corner of Utah. The Mormons at that time thought that if white, Mormon families settled in this sparsely populated area, they might have a \\"civilizing\\" effect on the local Indians, who had been stealing their cattle. The group was decently prepared in most respects, but they failed to realize that the land they would be in would have little grass to feed the cattle they brought--causing many of their animals to starve to death--and they based their route on the reports of three overly optimistic scouts. The scouts' report of the area said the route would be difficult but possible--which was true--but until the group found itself high on the edge of a cliff, two thousand feet above the Colorado River, none of them realized just HOW difficult.<br /><br />Heavy snow made the road behind them impossible to use, so instead of turning around, fifty of the group's men worked hard dynamiting what had been a narrow, one hundred-foot-deep, two thousand-foot-high crack in the cliff into a dangerous, almost vertical wagon road. Others managed to ford the Colorado River and develop a road out of Glen Canyon on the river's other side, and others found, cut, and hauled trees to use in building a ferry for all the wagons to cross the river. The route down the Hole-in-the-Rock was so steep that sloping wooden platforms had to be attached to cliff walls at points, and when the group finally descended down the insane route, after six weeks of blasting, picking, removing rock, and building, teams of men had to lower the wagons down with ropes tied to the wagons' rear axles.<br /><br />Eighty-three wagons, over two hundred people, and over a thousand cows and horses went down, and though there were minor injuries to people and animals--especially to the animals--no humans or animals lost their lives in the descent. The people crossed the river on the new ferry--two wagons at a time--and when they had gone as far as their bodies, animals, and supplies would allow, they just unpacked and stopped-founding what would become the towns of Bluff and Montezuma Creek, Utah.<br /><br />The expedition was an amazing one, and this book does a decent job at expressing the extreme degree of hardship this hardy group experienced, especially in the later part of its journey when the group had already crossed the river.wagons down with ropes tied to the wagons' rear axles.  <br />Eighty-three wagons, over two hundred people, and over a thousand cows and horses went down, and though there were minor injuries to people and animals--especially to the animals--no humans or animals lost their lives in the descent.

Scott Fitzgerald was a true wordsmith.  He knew how to use the english language, and in \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" he used it more skillfully than he ever had before.

The book is streamlined and focused, in part due to Fitzgerald's time spent writing an unsuccessful script right beforehand.  The structure of a script--in which every scene leads to the next, and every scene moves the story forward, and the whole thing is resolved in about ninety minutes or so--taught Fitzgerald immeasurable amounts about what this book didn't need to make it great, and about how to propel a story forward.<br /><br />The characters are memorable, the place and time (the jazz era) are vividly depicted, and the writing will surround and enfold you.<br /><br />Ignore that kids have to read this in high school--that it's almost a textbook to them.

It consists mainly of his letters to his family and friends--well-written, if slightly flowery letters--and is much better than the less-polished collection of his wilderness journals.<br /><br />Everett Ruess was a twenty-year-old photographer, artist, and writer, who rambled the desert with a manic passion for nature, beauty, and solitude.  He canvassed the American Southwest, including the canyons and slickrock where Lake Powell is today, on burros, on horses, and on foot; he took the trails everyone thought were too dangerous, sought out the most desolate, forbidding areas, and chased experience with a joyful craving--sought it without already having it.  He just went.<br /><br />Where he went last though is anyone's guess.  In 1934 he carved \\"NEMO,\\" and the year, at two different spots in the sandstone around Davis Gulch (in southern Utah, just north of present day Lake Powell), tied up his pack animals--or someone did--and disappeared.  No verifiable trace of him has ever been found, and though most theories involve his death, he could still be alive somewhere.  He'd be over ninety years old now.  Leaving his burros tied up to possibly starve was just the right touch to make people think he'd died--it might be what I'd do if I couldn't take the pressures of society anymore--and there is ample evidence throughout his journals that he never treated animals very well anyway: he killed every snake he saw, beat his dog so hard it ran away, and overworked his mules until one died of exhaustion.<br /><br />Besides, why would he carve \\"NEMO\\" twice--as in Captain Nemo, the character in Jules Verne's \\"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea,\\" a book he loved, a character who abandons society to live under the ocean--if he wasn't planning on abandoning society?  It seems like an amazing coincidence that he would carve that, and then just get murdered by cattle rustlers.<br /><br />Claims have been made that his bones were found in a crevice in Davis Gulch in the 1970s and given to a park maintenance worker and then lost.  A notoriously racist Indian has claimed he murdered Everett Ruess in present day Reflection Canyon, buried him there, and then tied Everett's donkeys up in Davis Gulch.  People have claimed that he got married and moved to a reservation, that he became a polygamist (he always claimed to be a \\"pantheistic hedonist\\"), and that he drowned.<br /><br />A local of Escalante, Utah, told me he met Everett back in 1934: Everett was grinning, beaming, walking between two Navajo men, and the men were singing.  That same man told me he thinks Everett was just a dumb kid who got himself killed by being foolish, and that he explored less than people say he did.<br /><br />That may be, but everything about Everett remains a mystery, and his character remains intriguing.<br /><br />Everett came out West, and at least part of him stayed here, and his legend grows more and more every day.  He came out west, and he's still missing.  Like the Anasazi.  Like a thousand rumored treasures.  Like 180 miles of the Colorado through Glen Canyon.<br /><br />Things and people just vanish out here.<br /><br />Fans of this book might also like \\"Sandstone Sunsets: In Search of Everett Ruess,\\" which contains several interesting theories on Everett's death.

Whatever fears and beasts they're forced to unleash within themselves soon overpower and posess them, and soon kids are dying left and right, kids are fighting and killing and running and hiding.<br /><br />What a cool book.<br /><br />What a cool book!<br /><br />American high schoolers should consider themselves lucky to be assigned to read a book this fast-paced, this dark, this twisted, and this original.  It's certainly not \\"Moby Dick.\\"  This book is violent and sudden (and gorgeously written) and asks many deep questions you may not be able to answer.<br /><br />What would you do to survive?<br /><br />What's your breaking point?<br /><br />What are you really like?<br /><br />It's an amazing and terrifying novel about the loss of innocence, about growing up in insane and scary world, and about the darkest parts of all of us.<br /><br />Read it, scare yourself, squirm in fear.<br /><br />Taste the suspense, feel the terror, and try to ignore the author's occasional, almost loving descriptions of the buttocks and body parts of young boys.

Its images will float across its pages, into your mind, and refuse to leave your life.<br /><br />It's a book so amazing that even though it's the story of two crazed killers murdering an entire family, and even though no detail or fear or violence is spared in the telling of it all, the things that stand out most are the beautiful, hopeful, healing moments: a murdered woman's collection of porcelain \\"tiny things,\\" or a murdered schoolgirl's friend--happy and growing--visiting a gravesite on a sunny day.<br /><br />The book tells the TRUE story of a Kansas family who are all senselessly murdered in their homes.  It tells the story of their murderers, it tells the story of the law that pursues the killers, and of the community that reels from the crime.<br /><br />This is by far Truman Capote's best book.  It's full of hope and sadness, good and evil, and it never fails to scrutinize and explore the spaces between both those pairs.  It is amazing.  Buy it, read it, remember the victims, and feel grateful Truman Capote was around to tell their story...because no one else could tell it like he could.  Read it, and let it haunt you.	2005-10-04

Then you stare at it from a standing position, making note of everything within it: little rocks, a plant, a hole here or there.  Then you kneel down and study it from that level: all of a sudden you can see mouse pellets, tiny bugs, and seed husks around the holes on the ground.  Then you get down on your stomach and put your face right up to it: suddenly you can see where beetles have nibbled the plant's leaves, you can see the footprints of mice, and you can see the holes are deep, and wider than you'd thought.  Then, after about an hour of fascinated scrutiny, you stand up, and the square foot, and all the ground around it seems to pop and buckle, as the realization of how much was all around begins to hit you.  The ground seems writhing with life and interesting things, and you can never look around you the same way again.<br /><br />It's very cool.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.  Its lists of various scat and tracks are a bit long for casual cover-to-cover reading, but as a guidebook its information is thorough and fairly complete.  Read it, learn from it, and add new depth to the way you view the world.bit long for casual cover-to-cover reading, but as a guidebook its information is thorough and fairly complete.

I don't know WHAT Oliver Stone was trying to do.<br /><br />The script, in case you don't know, is the story of a husband and wife with an insane past that go on a love-fuelled, almost invincible killing rampage across the country.  Their crimes are senseless and random, and the media (and the public) LOVES them.  It's the bizarre story of their killing sprees, their romance, their capture, and their escape, and...well, I don't want to give too much away.<br /><br />The script follows an incredibly cool format, of being mostly an hour-long TV special about the two killers, intertwined with the people making the TV special and interviewing the killers themselves, intertwined with flashbacks.<br /><br />It could have been an amazing movie, but instead we got a weird, cartoonish mess that exudes barely any of the well-developed themes, tight action, and believable characters (individuals and mobs) that Quentin Tarantino actually wrote.<br /><br />Read the script, and skip the movie--that's what I say.  Read the script, and hope that maybe someday Tarantino will remake the movie himself, the right way, the way it should have been.	2005-10-03

This book, although it takes place almost entirely in Russia, and is about Russians and about communism, is among the most pro-American, pro-capitalism, pro-freedom and democracy things I've ever read.  It's an amazing document of just what can happen when idealism and revolution give way to dictatorship, and when dictatorship gives way to an entire country enslaving and being enslaved, an entire country of millions of lives lived in fear that AT ANY MOMENT and FOR ANY REASON, ANYONE could be arrested, taken away to prison for decades, tortured, and/or shot.<br /><br />This book is an examination and an investigation of the long period of Russian history when the Soviet government just went nuts arresting everyone, out of cruelty, and out of fear that the people would rise up and overthrow Stalin's dictatorship unless opressed to the point of no possible resistance, to a point of extreme grief and weakness.<br /><br />The book details the sudden and violent arrests of millions of USSR citizens for little or no reason, the rough and hateful ways used to interrogate them, the inhuman treatment the prisoners faced in (and being transported to) the Soviet prisons, and the USSR's frenzied overuse of capital punishment (a.k.a. killing people).<br /><br />You aren't working in the fields hard enough?

Incredibly Motivational!  Hooray!  Gimme an I!<br /><br />But then I realized, this book didn't really motivate me to do ANYTHING.  It made me feel kind of motivated when I was reading it, but then the author admitted the last couple chapters were just being filled to increase word count (and therefore the book's price), and then I accidentally dropped the book in the toilet before I'd finished the last chapter, and then, I don't know, I had to go do something else.

As I read his books, I go back and forth between loving and loathing what I'm reading--I finish his books with a vague feeling of disappointment--and then for YEARS afterward I can't stop thinking about them.<br />It happened to me first with \\"Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,\\" and it's happening again with \\"A Death in the Family.\\"<br />\\"A Death in the Family\\" tells the story of a small Catholic family affected by the sudden death of their father/husband/brother-in-law/son-in-law/et cetera.  The first half of the book examine several different characters as they gather around the soon-to-be-dead-man's old and suffering father.  For all that time it seems as if the death alluded to by the book's title will be the death of the man's father.  Instead, the man himself dies in a car accident on the way back home from his sick father's.  The book flashes back to the childhood of the dead man's son, and hovers around many of the book's characters, seeming almost indecisive as to who it's going to be about, seeming nebulous and atemporal.  The wife.  The kids.  A preacher.  A neighbor.  A sibling.  At times the story feels scattered and unfocused, but the writing is always so beautiful that it the story almost doesn't seem to matter, and the vagueness seems to match the confusion that comes after the sudden death of a close loved one.<br />The book deals well with the themes of death and loss and family relations and grieving and God and religion, and James Agee writes masterfully about the way children think.  His descriptions of things and emotions are dead on, and his occasional experimental passages (like the man starting his car, and the sounds it makes for ten minutes) are a delight.<br />If the author had not died early of a sudden heart attack, and had lived to finish the book's editing himself, I bet it would have been even better.  I recommend this and any James Agee book to every literate person out there.<br />It's something else, and it's something good.d it's something good.	2005-10-03

But, if you need something to get you started and to at least get you to that point where you have a rough, tangible manuscipt in your hands, this is a good book to get you there.<br /><br />Following the regimen this book prescribes, you WILL write yourself a rough draft of a screenplay in twenty-one days.  But then, you'll probably need to spend months, maybe even years, working on it some more.<br /><br />You should know that, but that's not to say you shouldn't use this book.  You should.  It will help you get started, and it will give you good advice.  Don't take it as unbreakable law though, because ultimately it's just some experienced person's opinion.  I recommend buying it though, and I recommend using it with \\"Elements of Style for Screenwriting\\" by Paul Argentini, which is just a good, alphebetized, glossary of screenplay terms; the good, old-fashioned \\"Elements of Style\\" by Strunk and White (especially their notes on using the active voice); and a stack of actual screenplays.

The extent of the author's research is evident by the extensive notes and appendices that make up almost the entire back half of the book, and by all the authors and scholars who cite and praise this book as the final word on the subject.<br />The Hole-in-the-Rock Expedition was a two-mile-long caravan of horse-drawn Mormon wagons and livestock that travelled across the West in the 1870s, on the way to establish a new settlement in the untamed, southeast corner of Utah.  The Mormons at that time thought that if white, Mormon families settled in this sparsely populated area, they might have a \\"civilizing\\" effect on the local Indians, who had been stealing their cattle.  The group was decently prepared in most respects, but they failed to realize that the land they would be in would have little grass to feed the cattle they brought--causing many of their animals to starve to death--and they based their route on the reports of three overly optimistic scouts.  The scouts' report of the area said the route would be difficult but possible--which was true--but until the group found itself high on the edge of a cliff, two thousand feet above the Colorado River, none of them realized just HOW difficult.<br />Heavy snow made the road behind them impossible to use, so instead of turning around, fifty of the group's men worked hard dynamiting what had been a narrow, one hundred-foot-deep, two thousand-foot-high crack in the cliff into a dangerous, almost vertical wagon road.  Others managed to ford the Colorado River and develop a road out of Glen Canyon on the river's other side, and others found, cut, and hauled trees to use in building a ferry for all the wagons to cross the river.  The route down the Hole-in-the-Rock was so steep that sloping wooden platforms had to be attached to cliff walls at points, and when the group finally descended down the insane route, after six weeks of blasting, picking, removing rock, and building, teams of men had to lower the wagons down with ropes tied to the wagons' rear axles.<br />Eighty-three wagons, over two hundred people, and over a thousand cows and horses went down, and though there were minor injuries to people and animals--especially to the animals--no humans or animals lost their lives in the descent.  The people crossed the river on the new ferry--two wagons at a time--and when they had gone as far as their bodies, animals, and supplies would allow, they just unpacked and stopped-founding what would become the towns of Bluff and Montezuma Creek, Utah.<br />The expedition was an amazing one, and this book does a good job at expressing the extreme degree of hardship this hardy group experienced.  The book is also fairly readable, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in Glen Canyon, Lake Powell (since it currently covers the bottom half of the Hole-in-the-Rock trail), southern Utah, Mormon history, Indian and white relations, or the Old West.<br />Buy enough, and you could build a little fort., removing rock, and building, teams of men had to lower the wagons down with ropes tied to the wagons' rear axles.

When I was first going into college in 1997, my older brother told me about this book he had just read, \\"Into the Wild,\\" by Jon Krakauer.<br /><br />He told me the book is about a guy named Chris McCandless, a man who--after donating almost $25,000 in savings to Oxfam (a world poverty and social injustice charity)--went on years of adventures across the country, and eventually tried to survive in the wilds of Alaska, in an old, green and white bus fitted for moose hunters with a bed and a stove.<br /><br />Chris did really well, too, until he ate a poisonous potato seed his guidebook said was safe to eat (though new analyses of the results of his autopsy have suggested he may have been killed by plain old starvation), and until the river between him and civilization rose too high for him to cross back over.<br /><br />Later, his starved, emaciated, sixty-seven-pound body was found by hunters--wasted away on the bed of the bus, in duct-taped jeans, on a piece of Alaskan land surrounded by a triangle of rivers.<br /><br />I couldn't get the story of out my mind.<br /><br />It excited, and saddened, and haunted me.  I bought the book as soon as I could, devoured its contents--once and then twice and then three times--and made plans to go to Alaska.  (I'd always wanted to anyways, and this was the clincher.)<br /><br />After a year of college, I moved to south-central Alaska, and attempted to hitchhike to the bus, but was sidetracked by a moving van full of hippies that took me to a music festival instead.<br /><br />Later in 1998, I made it to the bus with a friend and my dad (flying in by bush helicopter, with a guide), and found the bus much as Chris had left it.  His pants were still there, as was the skeleton of a moose he'd shot, his silverware, his chairs, and his fire ring.  Only his books and the things he'd written on the bus walls were gone.<br /><br />In 1999 I went back again with two friends--hiking into and out of insanely raging rivers, wading through beaver dams and rainstorms, and spending a lot of time being hopelessly lost.  A lot more of Chris's things had gone missing, and the logbook showed a ton of people had come to visit.  Anyway.  \\"Into the Wild\\" changed me.  Getting to (posthumously) know Chris changed me.<br /><br />He became my hero.  He became a symbol to me of not needing to already have experience to gain experience.  He showed me I could do whatever I wanted to, regardless of my experience (or inexperience).  And that was a very significant lesson to me.<br /><br />I grew to love my conception of Chris like I love my brothers.  I traveled Alaska, hitchhiked all over northern Canada and down to the Lower 48 states, canoed all around Lake Powell like Chris canoed the canals of the lower Colorado River (living on brown rice like he did), and hiked up the entire East Coast to benefit Oxfam, the charity Chris gave all his savings to.<br /><br />Along the way, I kind of outgrew Chris McCandless.  I grew to really disagree with the way he had abandoned his family, and with some of the stupider decisions he made...with the decisions that killed him.  I outgrew him, and he doesn't have the influence in my life that he once did, but I still think he was an amazing person, and I'm grateful his example was able to touch my life.  And I'm grateful that Jon Krakauer wrote this book.<br /><br />This, I think, is Krakauer's best book.  It's wonderfully researched, Chris's character is skillfully explored, and Krakauer's writing (at least here) is as good as subjective journalism gets.  Aside from being a terrific portrait of Chris McCandless, this book also contains an excellent chapter on Everett Ruess (the missing 1934 artist-explorer of southern Utah), and a good chapter on the author's own adventure climbing the infamous \\"Devil's Thumb,\\" solo.<br /><br />It's a terrifically written story that people will either love or hate...and I'm certainly one of the former.<br /><br />One last thing.  If you like this book, and you appreciate this story, check out \\"Disappearance: A Map,\\" a book on deaths and disappearances in Alaska.  Chris McCandless makes a cameo in it.  There's also a very good, although very cynical, lengthy article about the cult of Chris McCandless--an article that appeared in an Anchorage, Alaska newspaper not too long ago--and you can easily find it using Google.  It's called \\"I Want To Ride In The Bus Chris Died In,\\" and was written by Sherry Simpson.<br /><br />\\"Into the Wild\\" changed my life, but even if it doesn't change yours, it will at least entertain you for as long as you're reading it.<br /><br />And you really should read it.rances in Alaska.

In 2001, I hiked from Florida to Quebec with a group of five others, to raise money for a hunger charity.  When we passed through Boston, a friend of mine loaned me this book.<br /><br />This book is a history of suicide, written by someone who has been manic-depressive and suicidal.  The history is well-researched, complex, extensive, and disturbing.  At times, reading this book was like wrapping my mouth around the exhaust pipe of a truck, with clouds of soul-corroding blackness filling every corner of my being.  The book just contains so much sadness and grief: the sadness of the depressed people who have taken their own lives...the grief of their families...and the seemingly unreconcilable wrongness of a world where these sort of things happen all the time.<br /><br />When I read it, everything I read seemed to be about my older sister, LeeAnne.  The descriptions of depression all seemed to be about her, about how she behaved and talked, and in all of the accounts, the depressed people then killed themselves, or tried to.  They died, and were gone forever.<br /><br />It terrified me, but I was relieved to have read this, and I felt like I'd read it just in time.  Night fell fast, the other hikers and I made camp in a rainstorm in a dense, wet grove of trees in New Brunswick, Canada.  I left my tent and gear to go find a payphone at the flooded parking lot of a nearby truckstop.  I called my sister and left a message; I told her I loved her, and told I would call her back that week.<br /><br />In hindsight, I should have called every hour of every day until I reached her.  In hindsight, I should have called every family member and had them call her too.<br /><br />Because, two days later, my sister was dead.<br /><br />Dead from too many Ibuprofen and sleeping pills.<br /><br />Dead for the rest of my life.<br /><br />Dead forever.<br /><br />This book is a warning, a thoroughly researched, scientifically and emotionally valid look at depression and suicide.<br /><br />Anyone who has a depressed family member or friend needs to read this.  So does anyone who has been depressed themselves--though maybe not while depressed, as it might give you ideas.<br /><br />Your soul will darken for a while after reading this, but you will also become more aware.  My family and I use to joke about how my sister was always so gloomy, but this book will show you that depression is not something to laugh about.<br /><br />It's serious.<br /><br />This book could save your life, or the life of someone you love...if you read it soon enough...if you act on what you've read.

And that's okay.  There are worse ailments, and this one's easily soothed by picking up a copy of \\"New Mexico Place Names: A Geographical Dictionary.\\"<br /><br />This book is very well organized, and it's interesting because it contains a lot of information that the other book doesn't.  Plus, this book is much older, and so it writes from a perspective and a place in time that's very much changed today.<br /><br />For instance, the other place names book tells a little about Cedar Crest, New Mexico being a former tuberculosis sanitarium.  This one says it still is--and it gives details.<br /><br />I agree with the other review currently posted about this book: get both place names books, and use them together.

But I'm just not crazy about it.<br /><br />It's a fairly handy reference, and has a good index, and it especially has a lot of good information on a lot of southern New Mexico towns like Radium Springs and Fort Seldon.  Factually, it's great.<br /><br />The way it divides the state up into sections however seems somewhat random--into areas that were into cattle, areas that were affected by the railroad, et cetera--and unless you are very familiar with these areas, you may find the book awkward to use.  The book also passes over New Mexico's best ghost towns--Hagan and Tejon and the others on La Madera Road--but it's full of facts, and is pretty readable.<br /><br />If you are looking to build a small New Mexico library, definitely get this book.<br /><br />But if you just want one book on New Mexico, get Robert Julyan's \\"The Place Names of New Mexico.\\"  It's better organized and has more of the places you mighr want to know about.	2005-10-01

Edward Abbey considered it the heart of the canyon lands.  The residents of White Canyon, Utah--a town since submerged by Lake Powell-considered it home.  The Bureau of Reclamation just considered it a good place to build a dam.<br />That dam, Glen Canyon Dam, was built in the early-1960s, to create a reservoir in which to store the water of the Colorado River for the states that needed it, to use the river's water to turn turbines and generate lucrative electricity, to control the Colorado River's seasonal flooding, to bring visiting boaters and their money in from all around the world, and to stop water-borne silt and sediment from clogging Lake Mead, an even larger reservoir downstream.  The 710-foot-tall Glen Canyon Dam blocked the path of the Colorado River, the trapped river backed up behind the dam, and everywhere the water could go, it did.  It covered multiple rivers, created bays, filled Glen Canyon and side canyons and coves, drowned beavers and snakes and trees, and turned buttes and spires into islands.  It changed an almost two hundred-mile-long stretch of the Colorado River into Lake Powell, into a deep, manmade lake with about 1,960 miles of ragged, convoluted shoreline-a shoreline longer than America's West Coast.<br />That's what this book's about.<br />A lot of books have been written about Glen Canyon, but very few have focused so exclusively on Lake Powell--on its ecology, its invasive species, on the effects it's had on the environment, and on the good and the bad effects its had on the West in general.  This book is full--FULL!--of facts, and it's very valuable to anyone writing on or interested in this subject.  The book often lapses into complex (although often helpful) scientific data and charts, and its text is occasionally almost impenetrable,  but it's worth owning if for no other reason 9and there are other reasons) than its extensive chapter on tamarisks, an invasive plant imported from northern Africa and elsewhere.<br />(To know Lake Powell is to know tamarisks.

Each section addresses an area of New Mexico and features a map and a cool old photograph.  Each little chapter begins with the text of a specific sign, and then goes on to explain more about the historical background in detail.  Usually there are photos included.<br /><br />I've kept this book in my bathroom for the last several months, and aside from the skipping around I've done with the book while travelling, I've also been reading it straight through.  And it's good that way.<br /><br />If the book has any faults, it's that the author's style at times seems to be very similar to the style of the signs whose information he's expounding on.  Also, because the entries are generally only a page or two or three long, there are sometimes more things that I'm left wanting to know.  And finally, the author takes a very family-friendly tone--which is good if you're friendly, and have family, but not if you want to know about the cutting, knife-barbed belt the hermit of the Organ Mountains was wearing when he was found murdered, or if you want details on the whores of Old West-era New Mexico.<br /><br />Overall though, I really like this book.  Keep this and Robert Julyan's \\"The Place Names of New Mexico\\" in your car on your next New Mexico roadtrip, and before too long all your friends and family will hate you and wish you'd stayed home.<br /><br />Seriously, they might.<br /><br />Or--as is often the case--they might learn something...and you might too.	2005-10-01

For many people, the name Lake Powell conjures up images of a blue lake among red rock--of boating over a sprawling, azure sheen of unbroken water, beneath high, vermilion sandstone walls.  It calls to mind shorelines lined with tamarisks and cottonwoods, bays mottled with preening mergansers and watchful egrets, water caves full of reflected light, and sunsets mirrored by a shining, landlocked ocean.<br /><br />For others, the name alone is enough to make them start shaking in anger and sadness.  For those, Lake Powell is not a lake at all.  It's a misbegotten reservoir.  It's a crime.  It's all that lies between them and the legendary, long lost Glen Canyon-a stretch of the Colorado River so inviting, so overwhelming, and so full of secrets, it's often been called the Grand Canyon's lovelier sibling.<br /><br />Unlike Cataract Canyon upstream, and the Grand Canyon downstream, Glen Canyon was a tranquil place with currents friendly enough for even the most boyish of Boy Scouts and the oldest of old ladies.

I canoed the shores of every river arm, every bay, every canyon, and every cove.  I lived mainly on brown rice, experienced terrifying waves and windstorms, spent weeks of the winter in crushing solitude, and months of the summer dodging drunken jet-skiers.<br /><br />For over six months, canoeing was my life, and this book was my only instructor.  I had no clue what I was doing, but in a matter of days, studying this book and following its advice, I was able to meet every challenge nature could offer.<br /><br />My next planned trip is a long kayak paddle along the entire chain of Aleutian Islands...and I'll be taking a Laurie Gullion book with me then, as well.

They may argue about where the Navajos came from, and what their culture needs to survive and thrive, but no one can argue that they're not a fascinating culture deserving of documentation.<br /><br />Because they are.<br /><br />The Navajo Indians have lived in the area that's now the United States for centuries--probably since shortly after A.D. 1400--and may have migrated here from Asia, via Alaska and northwestern Canada, though there are other valid theories as well.<br /><br />The word \\"Navajo\\" is a Spanish corruption of a Tewa Indian phrase that meant something like \\"those who farm the canyons,\\" but \\"Din&eacute;\\" is the Navajos' name for themselves, and translates simply as \\"the people.\\"<br /><br />The Navajo Nation is the modern-day Navajo homeland.  It was formed in the early-1900s, to better allow the tribe to deal with American oil companies wishing to lease Navajo land, and is America's biggest Indian reservation, literally a country within a country.  The Navajo Nation has its own Bill of Rights, its own flag, a President, its own police force, freedoms and laws unique to the Navajo tribe, and levels of government known as agencies and chapters.  Today it's home to about 300,000 Navajo individuals, and covers 25,000 square miles of Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado--a reservation larger than the states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire combined.<br /><br />The Navajos are a major American culture, and they deserve books that are as well-researched and as fascinating to read as this one.

It's the book that guided decades of explorers and missionaries, and that has mercifully survived to offer us hints of what life in the West could be like BACK THEN.<br /><br />It's the story of Francisco Atanasio Dom&iacute;nguez and Silvestre V&eacute;lez de Escalante, two Spanish friars, who were tasked in 1776 with the goal of forging a route from a mission in Santa Fe, New Mexico, to a mission in Monterrey, California, and of locating sites for new missions along the way-to convert Indian \\"heathens,\\" \\"barbarians,\\" and \\"infidels.\\"<br /><br />Dom&iacute;nguez was in his mid-thirties, but Escalante was only about twenty-five years old. The two, with a small group of others, decided to avoid a northern route--out of fear of an Indian tribe rumored to eat light-skinned travelers--and as a result were among the very first to make maps and to record details of the Southwest's rivers and mesas. Their group started late in the year though, a sudden blizzard soon made progress impossible, and when they reached north-central Utah, they decided to head south and work their way back to New Mexico. They ran out of food, lived by eating their horses, and suffered unbearable cold, rebellious group members, and severe, frequent thirst. They reached the Colorado River around present-day Lees Ferry, southwest of where Glen Canyon Dam is now, and worked their way north along the river, looking for a way across.<br /><br />They passed the often-photographed Castle Rock and Gunsight Butte, chipped steps into the slickrock to allow their pack animals to get down to the shore, lowered their belongings over a cliff with ropes, and after some scouting, found an ancient Ute Indian river crossing, where the water was slow and shallow enough to ride across. That place became known as the Crossing of the Fathers, and is right around where Lake Powell's Padre Bay is now.<br /><br />Their trip made an approximately two thousand-mile-long circle through mostly unexplored terrain, took nearly six-and-a-half months, and explored more undocumented, unknown land than Lewis and Clark would later in their over two-year-long journey. When the fathers got back to Santa Fe, however, only their failure to reach California mattered much to anyone, along with their apparent waste of funds, horses, and supplies.<br /><br />Escalante was practically exiled, and died within five years as the result of bad health obtained from his trials in the desert.<br /><br />Dom&iacute;nguez was demoted, his possibilities of advancement destroyed, and he died anonymously as an old man, never recognized for what he'd done.<br /><br />If you are interested in the West, or the Colorado Plateau, or Glen Canyon, you need to read this.

It was the Sierra Club's--and the environmental movement in general's--first major statement on the construction of Glen Canyon Dam, the flooding of Glen Canyon, and the filling of Lake Powell.<br /><br />The book is a companion, or I should say the polar opposite, of \\"Lake Powell: Jewel of the Colorado,\\" a book by Floyd Dominy, then Commisioner of the dam-building Bureau of Reclamation.<br /><br />Both books are basically propaganda, though for seperate sides of the same issue; both feature scenic photos of a place, praising text, and pertinent quotes.<br /><br />Glen Canyon was referred as to \\"the place no one knew\\" because its lack of national park status (and protection) was a major factor in its being inundated by the trapped water of the Colorado River.  In actuality, a lot of people knew it--just not many with the Sierra Club.  In fact, more people rafted through Glen Canyon a year than did through the Grand Canyon.  C. Gregory Crampton wrote ten books about Glen Canyon before its demise, and liked to joke that THIS book should have been called \\"The Place the Sierra Club Didn't Know.\\"<br /><br />Which would have been more correct.<br /><br />All that said, this book is a valuable historical document--for its role in the Glen Canyon controversy, and for its role in this century's environmental movement.<br /><br />But it's not that good of a book.  The photos are below average: many have a grainy, low quality-feel to them, and most of them are of very small things, and fail to give the true scope and grandeur of what Glen Canyon was.  They are not Eliot Porter's best work, and some of the photos aren't even of Glen Canyon, but of other red rock from other places in Utah.  (That's true, believe it or not, and it's well-documented.)<br /><br />The quotes that accompany the photos are all right, but they're not amazing, they won't make you jump up.<br /><br />A far, far better book featuring photos of Glen Canyon is Eleanor Inskip's \\"The Colorado River Through Glen Canyon: Before Lake Powell.\\"  Check it out.<br /><br />And a far, far better collection of Eiliot Porter's is \\"Eliot Porter's Southwest.\\"  It's full of gorgeous black and white images from all over the Interior West./><br />A far, far better book featuring photos of Glen Canyon is Eleanor Inskip's \\"The Colorado River Through Glen Canyon: Before Lake Powell.\\"  Check it out.<br /><br />And a far, far better collection of Eiliot Porter's is \\"Eliot Porter's Southwest.\\"  It's full of gorgeous black and white images from all over the Interior West.	2005-09-30

If you like Arizona, buy this book.  If you write about Arizona, definitely, definitely buy this book.  It's a keeper.	2005-09-30

This is a very simplistic book about John Wesley Powell's first expedition down the Colorado River.  It doesn't say it's a kids book, but I'm pretty sure that's its main audience.  It's a quick read, and not bad, and even adults familiar with the subject might find a unique fact or two in it.<br /><br />For instance, did you know some scientists think the Anasazi Indians abandoned their homes due to a drought so severe that the Colorado River itself completely dried up?  I thought that was interesting, and the book also resurrects some insightful quotes from Powell's lesser-known book about the Arid Lands.<br /><br />If you're a desert person, and you want your kid to be also, you might consider getting him or her a copy of this...with a river trip brochure tucked inside the front cover.	2005-09-30

The author knows you're an uneducated fool, and he will prove it to you.<br /><br />That said, he's not an idiot, and a lot of his pompousness is justified.  If you don't mind having a thousand things quoted at you that you've only read half of, or the author's overall snobby tone, then you really might find some good insights into a the structure of books and the weaving of stories.<br /><br />...Or, you might find yourself scribbling death threats to the author in the margins.  ...Yeah, that's a bad habit of mine.	2005-09-30

This book could have been a lot more interesting if it had just stayed to the historical account of Jacob Hamblin--Mormon Apostle/Ambassador to the Indians--or if it had tried to portray Jacob Hamblin in a more multi-dimensional light...because Jacob Hamblin wasn't perfect, even though this book would have you think so.<br /><br />Jacob Hamblin was a pioneer Mormon of the Colorado Plateau, and the story is that while Hamblin and a group of other Mormons were about to attack a band of hostile Indians, none of the group's guns would fire correctly, even when the Indians were right in front of them.<br /><br />Shortly after that, Jacob Hamblin supposedly had a revelation that told him if he never thirsted for the blood of the Indians, they would not have the power to take his life.  And no Indian ever did either, or even hurt him, and Jacob Hamblin became the Mormons' key to settling among the Indians; he also helped with John Wesley Powell's second expedition down the Colorado River.  Hamblin's peaceful demeanor, his ALMOST never-failing honesty, and his genuine kindness to the Indians, as well as people's belief in the special protection that God seemed to have given him, earned him the respect and cooperation of almost everyone he encountered.<br /><br />This book is enjoyable if you're really into Southwest history--but it's not really history...and it's not really that good.	2005-09-30

The two, with a small group of others, decided to avoid a northern route--out of fear of an Indian tribe rumored to eat light-skinned travelers--and as a result were among the very first to make maps and to record details of the Southwest's rivers and mesas.  Their group started late in the year though, a sudden blizzard soon made progress impossible, and when they reached north-central Utah, they decided to head south and work their way back to New Mexico.  They ran out of food, lived by eating their horses, and suffered unbearable cold, rebellious group members, and severe, frequent thirst.  They reached the Colorado River around present-day Lees Ferry, southwest of where Glen Canyon Dam is now, and worked their way north along the river, looking for a way across.<br /><br />They passed the often-photographed Castle Rock and Gunsight Butte, chipped steps into the slickrock to allow their pack animals to get down to the shore, lowered their belongings over a cliff with ropes, and after some scouting, found an ancient Ute Indian river crossing, where the water was slow and shallow enough to ride across.  That place became known as the Crossing of the Fathers, and is right around where Lake Powell's Padre Bay is now.<br /><br />Their trip made an approximately two thousand-mile-long circle through mostly unexplored terrain, took nearly six-and-a-half months, and explored more undocumented, unknown land than Lewis and Clark would later in their over two-year-long journey.  When the fathers got back to Santa Fe, however, only their failure to reach California mattered much to anyone, along with their apparent waste of funds, horses, and supplies.<br /><br />Escalante was practically exiled, and died within five years as the result of bad health obtained from his trials in the desert.<br /><br />Dom&iacute;nguez was demoted, his possibilities of advancement destroyed, and he died anonymously as an old man, never recognized for what he'd done.<br /><br />This book is a good account of their underappreciated journey, uses good maps, and explore's the expeditions many characters well.  It samples heavily from the expedition's journals, and supplements them well with modern-day descriptions of their old campsites and routes, and it places their story firmly in the context of their times, religion, and nationality.<br /><br />This story is a must-know-story for any interested in the history of the West, and this book is a good place to start.journey.

We get it!  Some Mormons killed a bunch of people a long time ago.  It was horrible, it was sad, and evidently no one has ever died or had anything happen to them since then, because we're all still talking about this.<br /><br />Go to Google.  Type in \\"Sudan\\" and \\"rape\\" and see what kind of articles come up about things that are happening right now, things you might actually be able to do something about.<br /><br />I've made the mistake of becoming very interested in the Mountain Meadows Massacre, but now I'm done.  I've read enough.  I get the idea: people died, things were covered up, it was sad, and we should never let it happen again.<br /><br />Got that?  Next time a wagon train comes through these parts, I want all you Mormons to stay indoors.  Inside!  You!  Get back in there!  No going outside until the emigrants have watered their horses and left.<br /><br />...But I'm a bitter young man.<br /><br />And I should concede that this book (or booklet) is fairly well-written, though very biased toward the Mormon side of things,  and overly reliant on Juanita Brook's book as a resource.  If you're studying this massacre--why I don't know, to write ANOTHER book about it, maybe--you probably should buy and read this.  Yeah.	2005-09-30

It's a foul gasp of very honest cynicism from someone who doesn't care at all about your feelings.<br /><br />But(!) you should try not to care so much about your feelings either.  Care about what you're writing.  Care enough about your craft to take even the most hurtful advice and really look at it.  Because ultimately, you need to be the kind of writer who doesn't care about anything but writing something great.  Your feelings are incidental to the scope of what you need to accomplish.<br /><br />I'm not just talking either.  I just had a work of nonfiction I've been writing and editing for three years get absolutely trashed by one of my fact-checkers.  And it hurt.

Another talks candidly about the environmental problems of southern Utah being very real...even if he did spend his whole lif ehating environmentalists.  Some talk about Butch Cassidy, and others talk about grazing and overgrazing.<br /><br />The book is worth your money just for the account of Ned Chaffin--King of the Cowboy Storytellers--and all the other accounts are very entertaining as well, and offer good insights into the place names of southern Utah, and the Anglo history of the area.	2005-09-30

It was written by a Mormon with obvious Mormon sympathies, and that's okay.<br /><br />But it was also written a long time ago, and a lot of new information has since resurfaced.  I think if Juanita Brooks were alive today, with today's resources, she would write THE definitive work on this sad episode, and we could all be free to talk about things that we can actually do something about.<br /><br />But, she's dead.<br /><br />We do have her book though, and it is a good account of this incident--of this massacre.  It dwells a little too hopefully on the vague possibility that maybe the murdered wagon train provoked it (basing such notions on rumors), and it places too much blame on the Indians and not enough on the Mormons, but it's a good read, especially when paired with other more recent books on the subject.	2005-09-30

And if I did, I must have missed it the second time as well, because although I enjoyed this book, and although it is well written, it still doesn't seem to fit the slobbering reviews that are sliding down the book's jacket.<br /><br />The book is the story of four very interesting Holocaust-era personalities.  How much of it is true is kept vague, but the possible truthfulness of it all is accented by old photos that appear nestled captionless throughout the text: photos of people, of relatives, of homes and buildings, copies of newspaper articles and postcards and journals and business cards.<br /><br />The photos are alluded to throughout the text, and sometimes explained, and the author's words are much easier to visualize after seeing a photo of one angle of what he's writing about.<br /><br />The book is beautiful, and full of stories--of the four men, of their families, of the author, of Germany, and of the war.<br /><br />It's a good book, but if it's more than that, then there's something I'm missing.<br /><br />It's a good book, and it's good enough that I'd consider going back to look again.	2005-09-30

It deserves its reputation.<br /><br />I buy almost every used copy I can find of this book, and I give them away just as fast, to my friends from the East who come west, and to all my friends who love the desert.<br /><br />Read it, buy it, and see what he's writing about for yourself.  You'll be glad you did.	2005-09-29

This book is an interesting collection of early accounts of fairly uneventful visits to Rainbow Bridge, the world's longest natural rock bridge that's in southern Utah.<br /><br />Rainbow Bridge is forty-two feet thick, 275 feet long, almost as tall as the Statue of Liberty, and taller than Niagara Falls.  It's gigantic, and it's beautiful.  It's a perfect stone rainbow.<br /><br />This is an all right book, I suppose, though not as good as Karl Luckert's \\"Navajo Mountain and Rainbow Bridge Religion.\\"  That one's a classic.  This one's just nice because it has a lot of random accounts from random sources compiled in one place: from various old-time guides, from President Theodore Roosevelt, and from Zane Grey--that horrific hack of a writer whose words continue to haunt every other collection of southwestern writing.  Oh, how I loathe Zane Grey's writing...and his longwinded account of Rainbow Bridge is among his worst.<br /><br />Some of the book's facts are incorrect and uncorrected by the book's editor--like Zane Grey's assumption that the San Juan River meets the Grand Canyon (it meets Glen Canyon)--and there are always factual inconsistencies in any examination of the \\"discovery\\" of this natural feature that had been known to area natives for over a century.  Who was there first, who saw what first...those have always been murky subjects.<br /><br />Overall, this is the sort of thing you should read right before you visit the place.

I recommend it to anyone interested in the Navajo-Hopi Land Dispute, or to anyone living in the Four Corners states.<br /><br />What is the Navajo-Hopi Land Dispute?<br /><br />Well, over three quarters of the land that used to belong to the Hopi tribe has gradually, since the 1860s, been taken from them and given to the Navajo.  Now, of the sprawling reservation at the center of the Four Corners states--Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico, the states whose corners all meet at one point--only the reservation's small, misshapen center, the small hole of a big donut, is Hopi reservation.  The rest, on all sides of the Hopi, is Navajo.<br /><br />In the early-1970s, Congress enacted a law that gave the Hopis back some of their land, but by that time, the land had been lived on by generations of Navajos and become sacred to them.<br /><br />Some of the Navajos left, and were relocated into shoddy houses with dry wells and no roads to reach them, and many sold or traded their new houses to unethical real estate agents, and ended up with little or nothing.  Most other Navajos refused to give their land back, and were then forbidden to make any repairs to their homes, or to build on their land.<br /><br />The Hopi reasoned that the land wasn't the Navajos' to maintain, and hoped the building freeze would drive them out.  But the Navajos remained.  Navajos whose homes were unfinished had to live in what was already there, and Navajos whose homes were damaged couldn't repair them.  Many ended up living in houses with broken doors, broken windows, and holes in their roofs, which rain and snow could blow into.  The building freeze went on for over a quarter century, but now the Navajos have finally been granted permission to repair their homes and build on their property, and the two tribes are working hard at getting along.  Each tribe has been wronged, and finding a compromise hasn't been easy.<br /><br />This book does a wonderful job of examing this issue, and if the book has any faults at all, it's that the author seems unable to hide that she has a slight(?) preference for the Navajos' side over the Hopis'.  Overall though, this book is great.  Scholarly, but nor boring.  Factual, but always interesting.  It's full of very real people, very real problems, and very good writing.is book does a wonderful job of examing this issue, and if the book has any faults at all, it's that the author seems unable to hide that she has a slight(?) preference for the Navajos' side over the Hopis'.

This book is a real downer.<br /><br />Even the cover is.<br /><br />Even the title!  The Colorado River's not a river anymore?  It's true.  Can you turn a river on and off?  Can you control how fast a river flows?  (That sounds more like...a DITCH!)<br /><br />The Colorado is the most regulated river in America.  Over forty dams control its water, and with a word from the right people, its flow can be stopped just like that.<br /><br />The river starts in the mountains north of Grand Junction, Colorado, gets drained right away into various canals, and what's left runs from there into a couple of small reservoirs and into Utah.  It runs past the over two thousand natural arches of Arches National Park, and on to Moab.<br /><br />The river rushes past the mouth of the Green River, heads on through Canyonlands National Park, and eventually, stops in Lake Powell.  It goes on, though.  Alive, but less alive: hidden underneath Lake Powell, then through the dam, then coursing blue and green and silt-free, like it never was, down past Lees Ferry and through the Grand Canyon, with never a flood to wash out the tamarisk, and temperatures too cold for any native fish to live in.  So cold and so different that four of the Grand Canyon's eight native species of fish are now extinct.  Gone forever.<br /><br />Then the river's under Lake Mead, and then it's squeezing through another dam.  After that it's trying to keep Nevada and California from Arizona, and it's going through three more reservoirs, and even more dams.  Dam.  Dam.  Dam.<br /><br />What'd the fish say when it hit a wall?<br /><br />Dam.<br /><br />Then, it's the Rio Colorado: same thing, but in Spanish, and less of it.  It runs the Baja-Sonora state line in Mexico, trickles through some dying wetlands, and sometimes, in rare flood years, makes it to the Gulf of California.  The ocean.<br /><br />...But it almost never makes it that far anymore.<br /><br />The river is now very, very useful to people...but is it still a river?  And is what we've done right?<br /><br />This book is a good examination of that question, of the river's sad tributaries, and of the state of the river itself.  It's very factual, open in its biases, only occasionally slow and meandering, and it is dense with valuable (though sometimes out-of-date) information.<br /><br />Read this and learn.  Read this and be enlightened.  Read this and be depressed and angered out of your skull...but read it.right?   <br />This book is a good examination of that question, of the river's sad tributaries, and of the state of the river itself.

He was the first man to lead an expedition down the Colorado--the first two expeditions, actually--back when the river flowed wild, without dams.<br /><br />He didn't worry about all the details like a knowledgeable crew, funds, both arms, having an experienced crew, not knowing if there was a Niagara-sized waterfall around the next bend or not, and so on--he just went.  He understood you don't need experience to gain experience.  He and his crew paid for their inexperience by nearly drowning, nearly starving, and by misadventure after misadventure but in the end MOST of their group emerged from the southern end of the Grand Canyon with stories, experiences, and first-hand knowledge of a part of the world that few people had ever seen before.<br /><br />(Three of his crew abandoned the expedition, and their fates are uncertain.)<br /><br />This is Powell's story.  It's also a story of the geology of the Colorado Plateau, of the Colorado River, and of the West.  It's not a perfect account, but it is a classic one.  Powell's prose is at times high-falutin', he recklessly combines details from his first and second expedition, and he gives too little credit to his crew, but he is always an optimist, and always fun to read.<br /><br />Take a river trip, and take this along.  Or, take \\"Down the Great Unknown\\" by Edward Dolnick--that's a good account of that trip as well.  (I actually prefer it.)	2005-09-29

Bert left home, drifted across the West, worked many different jobs, grew older, and lived alone by the mouth of Red Canyon.  He was there for six years, mining gold and rafting the river, and on at least one occasion during his years in Glen Canyon, he rowed supplies over 150 miles UP the Colorado River, from Lees Ferry to his now submerged cabin.<br /><br />He never extracted much gold dust, but he grew to love the river and the land around it, and he sometimes took his wife back to see it, after he had moved away and gotten married.<br /><br />Pearl Baker has written an interesting book about Bert, though it's not exactly gripping, and it's not exactly complete.  It is, however, one of the ONLY books about this character who seems to pop up everywhere in the history of Glen Canyon and the Colorado.  So for that alone it's worth something.<br /><br />Other good books that mention Bert Loper or his hermitage include Gary Topping's \\"Glen Canyon and the San Juan,\\" Edward Abbey's \\"Down the River,\\" C.Gregory Crampton's \\"Ghosts of Glen Canyon,\\" Stan Jones's \\"Ramblings by Boat and Boot,\\" and Eileen Inskips's \\"Glen Canyon Before Lake Powell.\\"	2005-09-29

Four stars for historic value	In my research on southern Utah, Glen Canyon, and Navajo Mountain, I put off reading this book for as long as I could.  I figured: it's written by a millionaire not a writer, it's written long after Rainbow Bridge had already been discovered, and the cover just looks kind of dumb.<br />But I'm glad I read it.<br />The book features good descriptions of Navajo Mountain, of early trading posts, of traders John and Louisa Wetherill, and of a time when undiscovered Anasazi ruins could be found around every canyon bend and horses were the best way to move around in the desert.<br />The book includes good historic photos, and is even funny at times: like when the wealthy author talks about what sort of collars he likes to wear on his shirts, or when he writes about packing a makeshift humidor for cigars.  It's a must, I'd say, for fans of the Navajo Mountain area.	2005-09-29

The author dumbs the writing down just a little too much for a suggested audience of \\"Ages 10 & up,\\" the book shifts randomly from past to present tense, and there's at least one paragraph that's repeated almost word for word more than once.<br /><br />But, that said, it's one of the ONLY books about the Aleutian Islands, and as far I can tell, is the ONLY book period about kayaking along them.  For that alone, it's worth a lot.<br /><br />One of my dreams is to kayak from Anchorage, Alaska to Russia, along the Aleutian peninsula and the Aleutian Islands, and in my research for this trip I've come across very few books on the topic.  My wife found this one for me.<br /><br />Not only does this book contain some beautiful photos (by Barry Tessman, R.I.P), but it gives a good idea of the dangerousness of the waters, of the area's history, of the general terrain, and of the preparations neccesary for such a trip.<br /><br />It's a quick read, but for those in love with Alaska or this area in particular, it will haunt you for days.	2005-09-29

That it's written by someone who knew and lived among many of the stories' characters makes it even better.<br /><br />Butch Cassidy was a jack Mormon outlaw, back in the 1880s, 1890s, and early-1900s, and was the unofficial leader of the Wild Bunch--a gang of hell-raising ranch hands named for their rowdy, trigger-happy visits to local bars.  Butch led the Wild Bunch on the longest series of successful robberies in the history of the Old West, making use of well-planned attacks, attention to detail--like cutting all the telegraph wires along their escape routes--skilled horsemanship, and a seemingly impenetrable hideout: Robbers Roost.<br /><br />Robbers Roost was so isolated, so full of hiding places, so riddled with sudden cliffs and smaller canyons, and so hard for someone who didn't know the area to move through, that the Wild Bunch was secure in their hiding spots there.  They would rob a bank, or a train, and then escape into a maze that only they knew the way out of, and where fresh horses and natural springs were waiting for them.<br /><br />It didn't hurt the gang either that rumors existed of Robbers Roost being guarded by two hundred armed men, surrounded in land mines, stocked with an almost limitless amount of ammunition, and riddled with a hidden network of tunnels and secret fortifications.<br /><br />As a result of such rumors, the area being so difficult to move through, and armed outlaws being willing to defend it, the area was never successfully breached by lawmen.  Butch Cassidy eventually escaped to South America, and what happened after that is uncertain, though this book suggets it's pretty likely he came back to the U.S., and lived anonymously until the 1940s, when he died as an old man somewhere in the American Northwest.<br /><br />Supposedly, he never even killed a man during his entire outlaw career, believing murder to be the result of poor planning, and something that drew too much attention from the law.<br /><br />This book does a great job of detailing Butch's character, as well as the characters of the lesser known members of his various gangs.  I checked this out as a reference book, and ended up unable to put it down until I'd read it all.and something that drew too much attention from the law. <br />This book does a great job of detailing Butch's character, as well as the characters of the lesser known members of his various gangs.

How about a ghost town that not only became ruins, it completely vanished?  ...Even the land around it, and the red rock and hills above it, vanished.<br /><br />That's White Canyon, Utah, and that's the subject of this book.  Before this book, White Canyon was only a mentioned in a dozen or so other publications that dealt primarily with Glen Canyon or Lake Powell.  But no more.  Tom McCourt has researched and written a terrific little book that tells more about this tiny town that's been submerged by the impounded waters of Lake Powell than we ever knew before.<br /><br />The book's writing is solid and inventive, the book's structure (of featuring first the area, then the industry, then the town, then the town's boardinghouse, and then the town's people) is interesting and effective, and the book's information is thorough and fascinating.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who likes Lake Powell, misses Glen Canyon, or likes Western history.

The book's author brings to life all of the expedition's more minor (and usually overlooked) characters, and gives the reader a great sense of the danger of the river and the grandeur of the canyons.<br /><br />The author has an excellent sense of history, and does a wonderful job of tying all his sources together.  The book also includes a detailed look at how John Wesley Powell lost his arm, and an examination of all the possibilities of what could have happened to the three men who abandoned the expedition.<br /><br />If I had any objections to this book, it would be that the author dismisses too quickly the real possibility that a man named James White may have gone down the Colorado through the Grand Canyon alone two years before Powell did.  (I hope the author has since read \\"Hell or High Water,\\" a well-researched book on that subject.)<br /><br />Overall though, this is a great read, and is much better written and much more interesting than even Powell's account.

But along the way, the author puts every one of those carvings within their proper (and fascinating) contexts.  He places the carvings within the appropriate stories; he describes their characters, and he attempts to explain the various westward movements the inscribers were a part of.<br /><br />This book is a treat for lovers of the West and of the Colorado Plateau; it's obsessively researched, beautifully written, and presents a terrific overview of the history of the West.<br /><br />(One thing though: I realize the author had to decide on a scope for his book--the examined inscriptions, for the most part, stop at 1900--but I would like to have heard his opinion on modern inscriptions.  For instance, if Lake Powell ever gets drained, won't it be interesting to see--one hundred years from now--the inane insrciptions of houseboaters, carved hundreds of feet above the river's water level on cliffs completely unreachable by foot?  I think so.  I think history's never stopped; I think it's still happening.)<br /><br />Anyway, this book is excellent.

I highly recommend it for all fans of Glen Canyon and Navajo Mountain as well.<br /><br />However, the book completely lacks a bibliography or any sort of source notes, and the text at times seems so much like a campfire yarn that such notes would be nice to have.  Many of the book's stories are well told, but they just don't seem true.<br /><br />If you buy this, also buy James Knipmeyer's \\"Butch Cassidy Was Here.\\"  He examines many of the same stories and legends, but backs up his sources, and is a more careful historian.	2005-09-28

It tells the story of two of the main characters of the 1960s battle between \\"reclamationists\\" and conservationists: Floyd Dominy--the former head of the Bureau of Reclamation, and David Brower--former head of the Sierra Club.<br /><br />John McPhee puts the two of them in a variety of situations, and basically lets them argue with each other.  Their ideas are interesting, and the book does a good job at showing both sides of a tricky issue--environmentalism in general, and three certain cases in specific.<br /><br />However, David Brower is not a man who sticks relentlessly to facts.  This has been proven in the past, and even anti-dam writers like Jared Farmer and Scott K. Miller have pointed out as much.  In this book, David Brower makes a number of incorrect or exaggerated statements, and John McPhee does not correct them.<br /><br />Floyd Dominy also says some things that just aren't true, and again, McPhee lets these statements go unchallenged.<br /><br />(One of Dominy's statements include the \\"fact\\" that people have jumped off Glen Canyon Dam to commit suicide, not realizing the dam is slanted, and had their skin completely scraped off before reaching the bottom.  That is not true.  That's happened at HOOVER Dam, but never at Glen Canyon.  I have this information on the authority of Karl Frisch, a former Glen Canyon National Recreation Area ranger who wrote a very complete thesis on every death to ever take place in Glen Canyon NRA.  He's said the only suicide ever attached to Glen Canyon Dam was one in which a man jumped off a nearby bridge and landed on the dam's power deck.)<br /><br />Overall, however, this book is a good read, and it's worth reading for any students of the modern environemental movement, Glen Canyon and Glen Canyon Dam and Lake Powell, or water in the West.  John McPhee knows how to write simply, clearly, and compellingly, and his books are always a pleasure.	2005-09-28

A man walks into the woods with something heavy on his back.  It sounds like the start of a joke, but it's actually the start of an amazing experience of a novel.  A man walks into the woods, and makes his simple life happen, and the things that happen along the way are magical and beautiful, and full of hope and love and real life.  A man walks into the woods, builds a home, finds a wife, and raises a family.  Along the way, he civilizes the wilderness, and then civilization begins to surround HIS wilderness, and some of it seems bad, but not all.  Along the way, mushrooms wobble on stalks like cold, bodiless lungs, and sometimes, someone steps on the back half of an ant, and the ant's front half runs and struggles to get away.  This book is poetry, but it's also an account of two of my favorite literary characters, Isak and Inger.  Isak: a simple, strong man with a knowledge of what's important, and how he wants the world to be.  And Inger: a kind woman with a harelip, whose baby dies mysteriously, suspiciously.  Morally, the characters aren't perfect human beings, but they are perfect characters, and perfectly depicted.  I would recommend this book to anyone--it's among my top ten, for sure.	2005-09-27

This book is pretty much what its title says it is: a book about people in a crackhouse.  It's incredibly sad at times, and the characters are depicted in good detail, but the author's dedicated quest to make this book something for everyone and not just for anthropologists sometimes backfires, and the story comes across as oversimplified and dumbed down.<br /><br />I would have liked more about the author's experiences spending time in this crackhouse, and about what sort of moral stance he had to take when he found himself in rooms with young girls trading oral sex for drugs, and that sort of thing.  The author's effort to minimize his own presence in the book just makes his character more mysterious, and made me wonder about him: did he try crack?  Was he ever tempted by these promiscuous young girls?  He raises a lot of questions--and not just about himself--but he gives a lot fewer answers, and doesn't leave the reader with much hope at all for any of the book's human subjects.<br /><br />Maybe that's about right, though.	2005-09-27

The writing isn't bad either, and the whole book gives a good overview of this amazing monument.<br /><br />The Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument is an almost 2700-square-mile area of southern Utah set aside by President Clinton in 1996.  The area borders Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, stretches for miles up to Bryce Canyon National Park, Dixie National Forest, and Utah's \\"forgotten\\" national park, Capitol Reef.<br /><br />Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument is bigger than Utah's five national parks put together, and bigger than the entire state of Delaware.  It protects one of the largest areas of wilderness remaining in the lower forty-eight states--an area that includes thousand-year-old pi&ntilde;on and juniper trees, countless canyons and mesas, and an estimated 100,000 archeological sites including pictographs, pit-houses, and rock shelters.  The monument includes the Grand Staircase--a series of massive cliffs and benches that form a natural desert staircase only a giant could use; it includes the 1600-square-mile Kaiparowits Plateau--a long plateau of scarcely explored mesas; and, it includes all the canyons of the Escalante River that aren't within Glen Canyon National Recreation Area.<br /><br />Many people, including the authors of this book, I presume, consider the monument to be only a good thing--and it might be--but there's a lot more to the issue.<br /><br />President Clinton made it a monument without seeking approval from Utah's governor, its congressional delegates, or the people whose incomes and livelihoods depend on the area.  Utah's small town locals were so upset that they wore black armbands, released black balloons, and lynched dummies made to look like Bill Clinton from their lampposts.  President Clinton didn't even dare come to Utah for the monument's dedication.  Instead, he held the dedication in Arizona, on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon, an over one hundred-mile-long drive from the monument itself.<br /><br />The Utah townspeople of Tropic, Henrieville, Escalante, and Boulder all feared that the monument would take away their grazing land, and that it would interfere with their ability to earn money extracting coal, gas, and oil from within the monument--and it does.  That's the idea, I suppose.  It's supposed to stop people from mining and developing the area, and from ruining an irreplaceable wilderness.<br /><br />But the ranchers that used to graze cattle there have REALLY had a hard time though.  They depend on grazing land to make a living, and the government has tried a lot of tricks to sneak the ranchers' sheep and cows away.<br /><br />The book doesn't really talk much about the impact the monument had on the area's people, like the ranching families that have lived there for well over a century.  I've had the opportunity to meet and interview a few of these families, and was amazed that many of them were left completely unable to support their families in the way they had for generations.  I've heard stories of the government rounding up and selling the families' cattle without their permission, even though the monument's rules techinically provided for the continued grazing rights of the local families.<br /><br />Anyway.  Overall, this is a great book.  The photos are beautiful, and it's well put-together.  But the area is more than just a pretty, historic place.  It's home to a lot of people, and those people have long been part of this area's history.d, he held the dedication in Arizona, on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon, an over one hundred-mile-long drive from the monument itself. <br />The Utah townspeople of Tropic, Henrieville, Escalante, and Boulder all feared that the monument would take away their grazing land, and that it would interfere with their ability to earn money extracting coal, gas, and oil from within the monument--and it does.

Its author has tried incredibly hard, and succeeded, at writing a book that is unbelievably fair, and that presents the controversial story of the building of Glen Canyon Dam in as truthful and as unbiased a light as possible.<br /><br />Russell Martin, the book's author, doesn't even mention (until the book's end) whether the book's main characters--the dambuilders and the conservationists--are republicans or democrats; this allows those characters to escape the stigma those labels would bring, and allows the reader to consider the characters just on what they did and what they said, and not instantly dismiss them because they're political parties may not be our own.<br /><br />This book is beautifully researched, written as a gripping narrative, and well-worth reading--though I have to add that it's so full of information that about three-quarters of the way through the book I experienced a brief feeling of being absolutely glutted on facts about the subject.<br /><br />This is an excellent book though, and I would recommend it (along with Jared Farmer's \\"Glen Canyon Dammed\\") to anyone interested in the subject of this controversy.	2005-09-26

The book is one of the fairest, most objective books out there on the subject of Glen Canyon and Lake Powell.  It realizes that Glen Canyon was someplace wonderful, and that Lake Powell may be as well.  It questions the very subjective idea of wilderness, deftly examines a very difficult topic, and challenges the cliches that often accompany any discussions of this matter.<br /><br />Jared Farmer has written a book for those on both sides of this issue, though I've no doubt the author has a decisive opinion of his own.  He presents old facts with new information, and shapes a perception of the area and of the issue that's both insightful and unique.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read about this issue, about the West, or about the environment.

I still worry about him after reading it, and after reading its sequel, \\"My Friend Leonard,\\" which is also great, but sadder.<br /><br />At times reading this book is a lot like being beaten up, but even in some of the book's harshest moments, there are little moments of kindness and friendship that are so touching, that I'd start to hope again, and my heart would melt.<br /><br />This book is full of sex and violence and drugs and explicit language, yet I would recommend it to every high school and college student out there, just to remind them of the danger of drugs.

Although his adventurous (and eventful) trip ended prematurely for a number of very justifiable reasons, the book that came out of that trip should suffer no such fate.<br /><br />\\"Velvet Waters, Canyon Walls\\" is a rare photographic and literary look at Utah and Arizona's Lake Powell before it had ever completely filled.  Before a white, calcite ring had encircled its entire shoreline.  Before the debate over putting Lake Powell in Glen Canyon had reignited and become the heated topic it is today.  The book is also unique in that it looks at Lake Powell, a spectacular although manmade reservoir, as a place worth being, as a place full of nature and wonder and the elements, not just as a water storage facility and a crime, as so many pro-Glen Canyon advocates would have people believe it is.<br /><br />As the debate over Glen Canyon and Lake Powell heats up, I hope this book will find a new audience, and I hope Colin Warren is able to write a new chapter or two for it, in which he goes into more detail about his actual trip.  It's a shame an excerpt from this book wasn't included in the recent anthology \\"The Glen Canyon Reader\\"; it would have been a perfect selection to represent Glen Canyon post-Glen Canyon Dam.	2005-09-08

Western history says that John Wesley Powell was the first man to boat through the Grand Canyon, but this book is PROOF that that is incorrect.  After reading this well-written, insightful, thoroughly researched, extremely readable examination of the James White story, I am convinced, now more than ever, that James White was the first man to raft down the Colorado.  Eilean Adams's writes well of the people, throughout history, who worked to discredit James White's story, and in turn (justly) discredits them.<br /><br />James White supposedly built a raft and took to the Colorado River to escape some Indians, and my only problem with this book is that she didn't examine why he didn't get off his raft farther down the river, where the canyon walls opened up--at a place like Lees Ferry, for example.<br /><br />Aside from that though, this book is first-rate.  Even if you know nothing of his story, or of Western history, the book is a thrilling adventure tale I would recommend to anyone.	2005-09-07

This book is invaluable to me as someone obsessively interested in the history of the ghost towns of central New Mexico.  Even to me though, it's not the most gripping read.<br />The chapter on the wrongfully condemned town of Tejon, New Mexico is outstanding, and the book contains a lot of great, hard-to-find information.  It's structure, however, its lack of an index, and its inability to find and tell the fascinating stories buried within the information it contains makes it not exactly something to read for fun.  But if you live in central New Mexico, if the words \\"La Madera Road\\" turn you on, if you care about what was here before your parents were, then buy this, buy this for sure.	2005-09-03
US	24821538	R30I2DHUAL3WTG	0816522421	450878446	The Glen Canyon Reader	Books	3	10	14	N	Y	If I could give it 3 1/2 stars, I would.	I have read probably over fifty books about Glen Canyon, Lake Powell, and the San Juan, Escalante, and Colorado Rivers, not to mention countless articles, all while researching a book about Lake Powell of my own.<br /><br />That said, \\"The Glen Canyon Reader\\" offers a nice assortment of selections from many of those books, and a few articles and excerpts from books and magazines that are usually much harder to find.  I would recommend it to anyone looking to get a rough overview of Glen Canyon history.  The book's selections by Edward Abbey, Bruce Berger, and Jared Farmer, are terrific, especially the article by Jared Farmer (author of \\"Glen Canyon Dammed\\").<br /><br />While reading Jared Farmer's article, a line from \\"The Great Gatsby\\" kept flitting through my head: \\"You're worth the whole damn bunch of them put together.\\"  His almost shouldn't have been included, because it made most of the others seem inferior.  In contrast to his, the historical excerpts from John Wesley Powell and from Escalante & Dominguez seemed dustier and more stale, the magazine articles seemed triter, and Katie Lee's book excerpt seemed even more crazed and poorly written that it would have seemed normally.<br /><br />Katie Lee's excerpt is a main reason I haven't rated this book higher.  I just really don't like her writing, or her insanely political, idealizing, villainizing stance.  I think her presence is a much bigger detriment to the case against Glen Canyon Dam that it is a help.  Female folksingers are annoying.  Poll America, and I'm sure the majority will agree with me.  Katie Lee is like a Joan Baez singing awful rhymes about the Colorado River swishing between her legs; her poetry is awful; her cutesy sayings about the \\"Bureau of Wreck-the-Nation\\" are just not funny.  Skip her excerpt, and you're reading a solid, four star book.<br /><br />The book is not a bad overview, though.  I really did enjoy it.  I do wish it had at least a single excerpt from the writings or oral history of some of of the Native Americans in the area though, and I think the editor could have done more to find another piece or two representing modern-day Glen Canyon, a.k.a. Lake Powell.<br /><br />Despite having read a lot on this subject the last few years, I did learn things from this book.  It contains Floyd Dominy's out of print booklet \\"Lake Powell: Jewel of the Colorado,\\" it has clues to the Everett Ruess mystery I haven't read elsewhere, and it features several stories of animals trapped by the rising waters of Lake Powell that were completely new to me.  If you're passionate about this subject, absolutely, get this book.  You'll almost certainly learn something new.<br /><br />And, if you know nothing about this subject, this really wouldn't be a bad place to start.oral history of some of of the Native Americans in the area though, and I think the editor could have done more to find another piece or two representing modern-day Glen Canyon, a.k.a.

US	24821538	R12GT54LTRZH69	087905803X	525758037	Sandstone Sunsets	Books	4	6	7	N	N	If you're interested in Everett, you'll probably enjoy this.	The mystery of Everett Ruess is a cool one.  A guy walks into the desert, carves \\"Nemo\\" (Latin for \\"nobody\\") in two places on the canyon walls, and then disappears.  It seems as if he set up his disappearance perfectly--he'd even talked about it before--and yet lots of evidence points to him being murdered.  Seventy years have passed, and still no one knows for sure.<br /><br />If you're already interested in this mystery, or would like an introduction it, \\"Sandstone Sunsets\\" is a good read.  It's full of interesting theories and evidences that aren't commonly heard elsewhere, and it's a fairly well written.<br /><br />It's funny though, in the About the Author, it says Mark Taylor has occasionally written for \\"Hustler\\" magazine, and in the book he often describes slickrock pinnacles and mounds as phallic, or breast-like.  That cracks me up.	2005-08-27
US	24821538	R1MYV8IYKO21UP	0964807807	20980164	The Colorado River Through Glen Canyon: Before Lake Powell	Books	4	12	13	N	N	A Photographic Punch in the Gut	I have been working for years now on my own book about the controversy surrounding Lake Powell and Glen Canyon, and out of all the things I've read and seen, and all the people I've talked with, nothing has made the case for Glen Canyon more clearly than this book right here.  If you are familiar with Lake Powell, then you know might that Gregory Butte is a tall island in the middle of Lake Powell's Last Chance Bay.  But, open this amazing book and you'll see that Gregory Butte was merely a single, amazing spire surrounded by miles and miles of twisting slickrock canyons and mesas all racing and swelling toward the butte in their center.  Never before was I so aware of just how much is now underwater.  It's almost unbelievable.  This book is beautiful, but it is also depressing and enraging for the sad truths it reveals.  It will show you one of the most gorgeous places you've ever seen, and then tell you that place no longer exists, and that you can never go there.  I discovered this book in the stacks at UNM, and sat on the floor for hours until I had studied every page of it.  I wouldn't argue with someone that gave it five stars, but I'm giving it four solely because the book's text left a little something to be desired.  Some of the quotes are quotes that have been repeated in every book ever written about Glen Canyon, and many are from a certain female folksinger that I just find annoying.<br /><br />That aside, this is an amazing book.  True, it idealizes Glen Canyon as a place of untouched nature--when it also had Boy Scouts that killed snakes for fun, beaches strewn with unburied human waste, and mines that indiscriminately dumped radioactive piles of uranium tailings right by the river--but there WAS still an awful lot to wax poetic about.  Get this book, get this book, get this book.  If you are at all interested in this subject, get this book.  Buy it no matter what the cost.	2005-07-28

This book is filled with hilarious and creative images--like a talking toothpick with a splinter for an arm, two kids driving across the Atlantic Ocean on a bridge made of ice, and a villain so evil every shadow he casts tries to leave.  There are no goblins or trolls or vampires or fairies or elves, because Obert Skye willfully defies the unwritten rule that says fantasy authors have to use the same dozen creatures as every author before them.  Instead, he peoples \\"Leven Thumps\\" with Lithens--people who travel entirely by fate; Sycophants--foot-tall creatures whose only power is to make people fall asleep and dream about how great Sycophants are; Nits--who can freeze anything with a thought; and more.<br />\\"Leven Thumps and the Gateway to Foo\\" is unlike anything I've ever read, and incredibly fun.  There are good reasons it's flying off the shelves, and those include excellent writing, a unique story, and unforgettable characters.  Read it, read it, read it!	2005-06-16
