By the end of the fifth chapter, I regretted making that promise.  Matt and Attean's adventures were thrilling, chilling (really, I did get scared), honest, moving, and  unforgetable.  When they first met, I wondered if they would ever become  friends, and watched them cope with the situation, wondering always what  would come tomorrow, and wishing I could turn the page and continue  reading.  Would they become friends?  When would Matt's father return?  Would Matt ever have to part with ROBONSON CAROSE?  The whole story was  captavating.  A grand treat!  Job well done, Spehere!	2000-07-02

It also serves as a great summer read for school-age kids, because there are so many and once you get started you'll want to read all the books.  THE TOWER  TREASURE followes the adventures of &quot;America's favorite detective  duo&quot;, Frank and Joe Hardy, as they solve their very first mystery. The  &quot;few flaws&quot; refurred to in the title of this review aren't major,  so I do suggest that you read  at least this (if not more) Hardy Boys  mysteries. First of all, there aren't many girls in these.  I  know girls  are meant for NANCY DREW, but there should be more females featured in  HARDY BOYS.  Second, it bothers me that the boys relied on their father  (who is a detective by perfession) too much for assistance in the  mystery-solving and theif-tracking.  I would like to see them grow more  independent in future books.  Then again, I have a special liking for THE  BOXCAR CHILDREN by Gurtrude Chandler Warner.  Those are nineteen orginal  mysteries featuring four very independent children--Henery, Jessie, Violet,  and Benny Alden. Their grandfather (whom they live with) has no special  sluthing skills, and they don't turn to him as often as Frank and Joe turn  to their father.  That's one of the things I like about it. But The Hardys  have their own ways of bringing criminals to justice, and the book was  always fun to read.  I can't wait to read about the adventures of the Hardy  Boys at THE HOUSE ON THE CLIFF!  A very enjoyable novel.  (Highly  reccomended.)	2000-05-21

Since GOOSEBUMPS has gotten really famous, R.L. Stine lost histouch.  The first few books were good, but since about thetwenty-third, it's gotten really bad.  This one is only good because of the suprise that pops at you late in the book. The charecters aren't real at all, the plots are just barely good, and the stories are stupid.  GOOSEBUMPS SERIES 2000 has really gone downhill from the start.  This story is the second part of Jack Acher's story of an alien landing in his hometown and getting power by squeezing people. I mean, COME ON!  I started not to bother with R.L.  Stine after I got to about age eleven because I was introduced to really good books and realized how childish his books are.  This one was my favorite, but that doen't mean it's any good....  It just means the others are worse. Avoid R.L. Stine except for his autobiography, IT CAME FROM OHIO!.

My enjoyment of this classic story began when I saw the Disney animated masterpice witch was  based on Victor Hugo's novel. When this book was given to me as a gift, I  was thrilled. I read the entire book, and, although there is no pictures,  felt like I was right there with Quasimodo and his friend, witch he loved,  the Gypsy girl Esmeralda, Frollo, and all of the people in the book. The  deaf bell ringer's adventures as presented to young readers like myself in  this very special adapted verson of The Hunchback of Notre Dame (and in any  other edition of the book I'm sure) offer thrills that don't stop even when  you finish the book, adventure as only Victor Hugo can do it, scary moments  that make you gasp in fear, heartfelt scenes that will move you forever,  and much more. A garenteed great read! All in all, The Hunchback of Notre  Dame has it all! And, (to me) it seems Bullseye Step Into Classics has made  it step into everyone's library of classics-- again!	2000-04-29

The pictures alone are enough to tell  the story to the very youngest readers, but the words give something the  pictures cannot, as do almost all books that I have seen.<br />Note that older  readers will also enjoy JULIE OF THE WOLVES and it's two sequels, JULIE and  then JULIE'S WOLF PACK, by Jean Craighead George, the author of LOOK TO THE  NORTH: A WOLF PUP DIARY.<br />And now I have no more to say, so, as ends the  introduction....<br />Why do I love them so?

But the account  can be read anyway wished, and the reader will still get much out of it.   But I'm getting ahead of myself, so I shall slow my pace and begin where it  is proper to begin--at the begining.<br />In PRINCE CASPIAN (Book #4 new  order, Book #2 old order) a false king holds Narnia's throne, and while he  held it, he sent seven Narnian Lords looking for land beyond the eastern  Lone Islands. To the false king Miraz's intent, none of them  returned.<br />When the true king, Caspian X, took the throne, he took an oath  to set out for a year and a day to find the seven lords and bring them back  to their homeland of Narnia if they are alive, or, upon finding them dead,  avenging them if possibble.  And this story is that story, of the voyage to  find the Seven Lost Lords of Narnia, during whitch the crew encounter  dragons, water that can turn anything to pure gold, merpeople, magicians,  and the whole assortment of magical creatures out there in the utter east,  where they not only search for the Lords, but also for Aslan's country  because &quot;where the water grows sweet, that is the utter east.&quot;	2000-03-11

Now, as they return  to the enchanted land, it is not a return of the Witch they have to deal  with, but a new problem for their land, and that is as follows:<br />In the  many years since they have been gone from Narnia, a false and unjust king  has taken the throne, and all the magical beings, enchanted talking trees,  and other magicfilled friends of Lucy and her family have disappeared from  vision, and Narnia is now as England is for the Prensieves--a man's  country!<br />Now it is up to the High King Peter and the other Prensieves to  aid Narnia once more by putting the rightful king--Caspian The Tenth--on  the throne and restoring the magic in their wonderful land.<br />All in all,  the plot is as best as ever, the charecters as charming as in all the other  books, and the events more suprising than ever before! PRINCE CASPIAN makes  a supurb forth Narnian adventure, (and it is) just as entertaining if you  read it apart from the other CHRONICLES OF NARNIA by the wonderfully  creative C.S. Lewis.	2000-02-25

Narnia's best.<br />(It), even though (it was) written before MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW, fills in the holes from the prequel,  as well as creating a new vivid and enchantingly entertaining story of  it's own.<br />IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A MAGICAL STORY, HERE'S YOUR  SERIES!<br />The order the plubisher put them in after Lewis wrote them is as  follows, although I'm not sure I spelled everything correctly:<br />#1 THE  MIGACIAN'S NEPHEW #2 THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE #3 THE HORSE AND  HIS BOY #4 PRINCE CASPAN #5 THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER #6 THE SILVER  CHAIR #7 THE LAST BATTLE<br />The star charecter of the books, I can tell, is  easily Aslan, and his bravery in LION was stunning!

Rowling are witty, mysteryous, magical, fun, scary, grupping, action-packed, adventurous, and daring.  HARRY has gone where no book series has ever gone before--winning the UK's Smarties Prize Award three times in a row for the three books in the series so far:  HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE, HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF  SECRETS, and, most recently, HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN.<br />I  just recived the audio of HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE to my great  delight.  I have already listened to the first chapter, THE BOY WHO LIVED,  and plan to enjoy many more experiences at Hogwarts--hearing them.  Now I  can only imagine what Quidditch will be like, what I will hear Harry say  when he discovers The Mirror of Erised, the note of panic in his voice when  he finds out Voldemort's plans, and the taste of victory over Slythern for  The House Cup.<br />Unchanged and in it's entirety, HARRY POTTER AND THE  SORCERER'S STONE will be a treat--just as unpredictable as Every Flavor  Beans!<br />To sum it up, just say one thing:<br />&quot;Once upon a time&quot;  never sounded as great as in HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE and  &quot;happily ever after&quot;  never was as great a final treat for the  ear.	1999-12-04
