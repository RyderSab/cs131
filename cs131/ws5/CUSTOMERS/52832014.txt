It's truly a hands on book, a combination of guide, tutorial and reference, targeted to beginner and intermediate web designers, that carefully and clearly guides readers through the process of planning and building universally accessible websites that conform to web standards. <br /> <br />It emphasizes thinking the total project through to create designs that work from ground up - thinking about content first, then planning, structuring and building. Each chapter is carefully structured and clearly explained, and gives you everything you need to complete a given task. <br /> <br />My background is in design and marketing, and I've found other books about CSS design to be confusing, unnecessarily theoretical and technical. Where other books are dry, complicated, and often esoteric, this book is focused on plain and simple answers with which even the newest beginners can build standards based sites. It makes learning fun and is focused on real world issues. \\"Integrated HTML and CSS\\" is truly \\"A Smarter, Faster Way to Learn.\\" It is the perfect book for anyone thinking of building a web site, or for learning modern coding techniques based on CSS and web standards.	2005-01-29

It always proves to be a favorite housewarming, bridal shower or hostess gift - everyone I've given it to raves about it.<br />What distinguishes &quot;The New York Cookbook&quot; is that it is a well researched and imaginative experience as varied, surprising and unique as my home city is - filled with ethnic groups, suprising combinations and a multitude of flavors and experiences that are never boring. The recipes, tips and stories are always refreshing and enlightening - rarely bland, and interesting and appealing for every occasion. From &quot;quick cook&quot; everyday meals to elaborate celebrations, you'll find the best of the best in &quot;The New York Cookbook.&quot; And wonderful cross-section of interviews and stories will make you feel like you're right at home in the kitchens and a regular guest in the restaurants spotlighted in this wonderful book.<br />I wish that there was a follow up to this book, as well as others by the very imaginative and energetic author/editor.	2003-09-18

You'll quickly learn how to build effective, user friendly and compelling navigation into a site and how to organize information to give visitors the best interactive experience by allowing them  quick access to what they need.<br />This book is an excellent, no nonsense, &quot;roll up your sleeves and get it done rapidly&quot; book that is thankfully low on jargon, buzzwords and puffery and high on technique and standards compliant code.

But when it comes to process analysis and integrating motion and static web design with database and content management, Hillman Curtis' \\"MTIV: Process, Inspiration and Practice for the New Media Designer \\" is a much more thorough and in depth analysis of both the creative, development, problem solving aspects of interaction design.<br />For the same price or for less money, any of books I mentioned above will give you much more information in a more logical and practical format, than this book.	2003-05-12

From the temp secretaries to the CEOs and everyone in between, you'll get a rollicking e-mail exchange between computer challenged, overpaid and under worked leeches who live on booze, drugs, cigarettes and beer and live to party at company (or supplier) expense - except for the token hippie.<br />Though based in a London ad agency during its pitch for the european arm of a US account, readers from all over the world are guaranteed to be laughing a host of stereotypes, including many outrageous, politically incorrect international jabs. <br />Don't miss this book - you'll find yourself returning to it when you're really in need of a laugh.	2003-03-01

It's well written and researched, and presented in an unintimidating, friendly manner, and covers all the basics you'll need to know to nurture and share a happy relationship with a devoted pet. There's excellent advice about choosing, housing, feeding, training and caring for one or more of this wonderful species of bird, and solid advice about handling emergencies, choosing a vet, etc. <br />And as other reviewers have mentioned, this book's insight into cockatiel psychology and development is exceptional, and it really helps to understand why a bird might be behaving in a certain way, and what this behavior might communicate.<br />Previous to acquiring a cockatiel, I owned a halfmoon conure for a number of years, and although I'm an experienced bird owner, I learned a lot from this book. I'll be sure to keep it handy in case I need to consult it in an emergency. I can't recommend it highly enough.	2003-02-20

This book gets you thinking, and its clear and focused  style is a joy to read in a genre that I often find overwhelmed by  overblown style and simplistic plots. <br />Although I found the romance  element to be unrealistic, the characters were well rendered, and the story  unique enough to have me hoping that Flower Net will be the first in a  series.	1998-10-21

Family sagas are mulled  over and dissected, conflicting cultures often force choices that Beaver  Cleaver didn't have to deal with.<br />On Gold Mountain is not only a  compellingly woven family/cultural history of perserverence and willpower  in the face of prejudice, it is also incorporates a very honest appraisal  of skeletons that a not quite as forthright narrator as Ms. see would  perhaps perfer to bury in a closet.<br />It's a compelling page turner, and  well worth reading, a vivid testimonial of a truly American family.	1998-10-10

I  made it halfway through, and although I did find the mystery intriguing and  the idea original, the cardboard characters, because of the monotonous and  unimaginative descriptions, and the perpetual whining of Smilla, I didn't  have a snowball's chance in the Equator of getting any furthur.	1998-09-27

An overblown and unconvincing setting  doesn't compensate for a lack of surprises and superficial plotting and  characters, and a medieval setting that rings false. It's a boring mystery  and an amateurish novel; most dissapointing from a usually wonderful writer  and exhaustive researcher.	1998-09-12

Buy this book. It's got a place of honor in my library along with Robin Williams, Lynda Weinman, David Siegal, Adam &amp; Tonya Engst and Don Sellers.   <br /> This book is unique in its emphasis that well constructed sites should be developed for optimal viewing on all platforms and browsers, and that the best sites can be constructed with a minimum of tools and &quot;bells and whistles.&quot; By emphasizing the fundamentals of good html, interface design, as well as the limitations of bandwith and screen displays, this is a concise and to the point overview of how to build a Web presence that works.

The lights blow out, tub leaks, or toilet won't stop flushing? Call the Super. Trees and dirt? You see them in the park. Flowers? You buy them to give, smile when you recieve, and go to admire them in the Botanical Gardens. Vegetables? You buy them at the supermarket or produce store; they often are frozen or come in cans.  <br />  My sister, whose entire repitoire of handyperson skills involved changing lightbulbs, recently moved to a house in what my family calls the &quot;country.&quot; Translation: suburbs not reachable by the New York City Subway System. She's got a lawn and a backyard, and can achieve a goal we've always yearned for...a garden. But what do you do when for all of your childhood you got in trouble for digging in dirt because it ment an extra trip to the Laundromat?  Because I learned everything I needed to know to get rock 'n rollin' on computers from the very excellent &quot;Dummies&quot; series, and there is no Julia Child or Martha Stewart of gardening that I know of, I bought her a copy of this very excellent book. She grew tulips, hyacinths, pansies, marigolds, and lots of other flowers I forget the names of. Tomatoes, squash, pumpkins, zucchini, onions, green beans, cucumbers, etc. flourished under her stewardship and graced her table. Mint, Dill, Basil, and other herbs grown in her garden enhanced her cooking. She's organizing her work for the '98 season now.  <br />  The &quot;Secret Garden&quot; can be real! But don't be misled by the &quot;Dummies&quot; title. You don't have to be as totally green-thumb challenged as my family to benefit from this book. It's got a wealth of advice for anyone interested in growing a garden, from what experienced friends tell me.	1998-03-28

It makes you think about how people &quot;lived to eat&quot; in the Northeastern US at the turn of the century before foreign travel, immigration, mass media, refrigeration, food processors, mixers, nutrition research, etc. made exotic cuisines and &quot;fresh and light&quot; everyday fare. <br /> The recipes are classic, yet loaded with good and creative cooking ideas that might have been overlooked in the 20th century...nutmeg in poultry dressing, etc. They are invitations to create meals that make you think about how economic and scientific considerations influenced how people ate. For example, you'll find more varieties of angel cakes; when you consider that sugar was more expensive than butter and therefore more of a treat, it's not surprising. Canning and preserving, and making out of season foods taste good, were necessary skills of any good housekeeper. Physical labor was a daily necessity, meaning bigger, heartier meals. <br /> This cookbook is as interesting to read as it is a source of good old fashioned American recipes. Adjust them to 1990's dietary considerations, and you've got an enduring classic you can use every day.	1998-03-25

It's especially refreshing in that it's not loaded with pages and pages of repetitive jargon, exhaustive histories about how the Web and the Net developed, etc., that create filler in so many others of this genre.

It's heartbreaking to think that when this remarkable volume by an incredible talent was first published, the author was criticized for the anger, longing, loneliness and guilt expressed in her poems. They were acknowledged more for their craft than the validity of the emotions they expressed. <br /> It's a clichee by now to bemoan how different Plath's life would be with the inroads of feminism and availibility of antidepressents in the '90s. But it's important to see how this unique voice can give incredible meaning to concerns that echo throughout the ages.  <br /> This wonderful volume of groundbreaking poetry is a must for any bookshelf.	1998-03-25

As a 17 year old freshman, I expected to have to force my way through the assigned chapters of what I expected to be a mega-boring dose of medieval torture. I was delighted enough to read the whole book in a weekend, and have picked it, and its sequels (which were not required reading), up again and again throughout the years. <br /> What makes it unique is that its painstaking research is concisely and vividly presented, focusing on specific people within the strata of life within a medieval castle. It doesn't glorify, get bogged down in details, pity or condescend to its subject. There's dirt, disease and war along with everyday chores, pastimes, dining and amusement.  It's a must read for anyone interested in an accurate and unembellished picture of the gamut of medieval society. I'm glad to see that it is still in print.	1998-03-25

I read it over 30 years ago and it remains one of my favorites. It's a tightly written and compelling page turner. However, it is fiction, and in-depth analysis of the history of the Princes in the Tower does make Richard III seem to be the culprit.	1998-03-11

Anyone who has done any designing for the Web owes Lynda Weinman a debt of gratitute for her CLUT and thorough analysis of color display and how it relates to design theory and interactivity. I found this book a painless and effective way to understand how the science and math can determine the range of color and design choices.  The author's background as a teacher at one of the nation's most forward-thinking art schools really shines through as &quot;deconstructs&quot; successful web sites, rather like an anatomy lesson.    Frankly, I don't care how the author became an expert, which some of my fellow reviewers express concern about. The fact is that the Web is being created on the fly by those who analyze, experiment and build from scratch. I've learned a lot from this, and Lynda's other, books. They have helped this ink and paper person transision to HTML and gamma display.  It's an excellent companion to her &quot;Designing Web Graphics,&quot; which I rate a ten.	1998-03-09

We all owe Lynda thanks for the browser-safe CLUT, as well as her clear, concise explanations about designing for display on a myriad of browsers, screens, operating systems, etc.   What makes this book even more exceptional is the wealth of advice on creating graphics that load quickly, on understanding the quirks of HTML and using them to advantage. Even a math-phobic like myself can make sense of, and apply hexidecimal color theory to the creation of web graphics.  This book will be of great benefit to the professional and amateur alike.	1998-03-09
