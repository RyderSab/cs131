Be prepared to stay awake or read this in one sitting because you won't be able to put it down. I'm glad that Linda Howard has returned to her sexy romantic style but has managed to integrate it into a compelling story.	2003-11-20
US	52039005	R3LLGFXRO9H62W	0399150897	362587713	Blow Fly	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Very disappointing	I wish I had read the reviews before I bought the book. I have loved her earlier books, but this is the first time that I had to make myself finish a book of hers. I skimmed the last half. I don't want to ruin the surprise developments in the book for anyone so I won't discuss the plot. But, I don't think Cornwell knows where she's going with these characters and she wrote too much about Kay's personal life. The plot goes in all directions and is hard to keep up with. You also need to go back and re read the previous two Scarpetta novels for this one to make any sense. I don't know about you, but I don't remember minute plot details after several years and this book is written as a continuance of the last two. WHat I have loved most about her books in the past is the well written mystery and the science. There is too little of both in this book. She needs to spin Lucy off in a series of her  own. Cornwell has more interest in Lucy than she does Kay. Don't buy this book! Borrow it from the library.	2003-10-23

I am an avid fan and was eagerly awaiting this addition to the \\"Dark\\" Series.Christine Feehan usually writes great books for escaping into a fantasy with hot sex and overpowering love. This book did not follow her regular formula. This plot tied in with the Scarletti book. There were way too many \\"humans\\", family members of the heroine. The plot of family intrigue and \\"jaguars\\" confused the plot involving the two lovers. None of her family were in the slightest bit likable. You kind of hope the jaguar does eat them. The two main characters just don't spend enough time together. I want to know more about them and was irritated every time I was interrupted with her family and the mystery of who is trying to kill them. This book was trying to link together different branches of the carpathians and also give more possibilities for future books.  Too bad this book was \\"sacrificed\\".<br />I don't know what Christine Feehan was trying to do, some kind of cross over into another genre?? Whatever it was missed the mark with me. I don't understand why romance writers leave the romance genre and move into intrigue/ mysteries. I hope Christine Feehan isn't following in the footsteps of so many authors who have left the romance field. (Such as Iris Johansen,Kay Hooper)	2003-03-04

I was a little impatient about 3/4 of the way through, thinking, alright already!! Too much waffling back and forth from the characters.Also, I always have a problem with time travel novels wondering how the author is going to twist the plot so that they can stay together. The ending is hurried with little explanation of how he reappears to be with her in the end. Easy to scan and a good pool or beach read.	2002-10-01

This book is similar to the Scarletti Curse. It's almost like she went back and rewrote it with more sex and changed the plot enough to have a different book. The mysteropis lions and supernatural evil being didn't work for me, but she did a better job of character development in this book than the Scarletti Curse. Overall worth reading, but had some big holes in the plot.	2002-09-09

Christine Feehan continues to develop her characters and give us more to enjoy. I liked Jaxx and the fact that she had a career and was able to kick [...]. The only disappointment was the ending. I can't believe she allowed the stepfather to badly wound Lucian. Lucian says over and over what a danger he is to mortals and immortals alike and then the evil stepfather shoots him and almost kills him. I was disappointed in this part of the plot but still gave the book a five. I hope her next book has a heroine we admire and can root for.	2002-07-12

In previous books, I was frustrated by the lack of communication between the people who were investigating. Hillerman would have two characters come to the same conclusion from different angles. In this book, he allows more communication between the detectives so that their efforts compliment eachother.	2002-05-27

I like micah and think the characters are staying true to the reality she has created. Anita Blake is finally growing up and accepting the people in her life. This book answered more questions and tied in a lot of loose ends. We finally begin to see what anita's own powers are and I think she is coming into her own. Yes, there is sex, but you shouldn't be reading these books, if you don't like the explicit sex. I can't wait for the next installment.	2001-10-17

I bought this book after reading the reviews and was pleasantly surprised that I agreed with the previous readers. This book is hilarious without being silly. I don't usually read historical romance, but I liked these characters because they were atypical. Her dialogue was well written and fast paced. The love scenes were HOT!! I laughed my way through this book and then re-read it the next day. Definitely a keeper. Can't wait for her next book.	2001-07-19

As the series has progressed, we've gotten to know more about Casey's friends and extended &quot;family&quot;. The characters are deeper and more interesting. Casey is more connected to her friends and her hometown. I enjoy her take on southerners and humorous southern &quot;sayings&quot;. I laughed outloud at her description of her dog and her surroundings. I was mildly disappointed that she and her boyfriend broke up and the sudden way it was introduced into the plot. Both she and the reader are kind of blindsided by Burley's falling in love with someone else. But, I guess this frees Casey to pursue her steamy flings with other men and will make for more interesting reading in the future. Great read, you won't be disappointed.	2001-07-19

When did she start to write such cutie stuff? Mr. Perfect was a four, but was a little too sweet for me. This book has gone over the sweet meter. I long for characters such as those in previous books. The characters in this book are too ordinary. Ms. Howard has also cut down on her love scenes and that was a disappointment. The two in the book are good, but the mystery plot overpowers the other storylines. The last two pages strike off on a weird tangent connecting two very peripheral characters. ...It didn't tie into the story at all. ...	2001-07-19

The lead character is more likeable in the book, but still on the edge fighting alcoholism and a need for revenge. I like the ending of the book, all the bad guys get what's coming to them. The secondary plot involving twin sisters also has a satifying conclusion. My one complaint is that the book was somewhat disjointed, jumping back and forth between subplots. Also the relationship with his wife wasn't developed so you understood the anger between them. I will go back and read previous novels just out of curiosity.	2001-05-20

In the last few pages there is a marriage proposal that had no build up and the  heroine is totally surprised that the hero is in love with her. Save your money and get this at the library. I would ask the author to return to the romance genre and stop trying to write a mystery novel. I miss the wonderful writing she did in her romance paperback releases.	2001-01-28

But I was hooked from the first chapter. For those of us who are less computer literate, some of the jargon was confusing and I needed to read carefully and then re-read some to understand what was going on.

She's tough and can handle rough situations but also doesn't take stupid chances. The mystery in the plot was a little weak. This book was more about getting to know a new character and all of her friends than figuring out whodunit and why. Overall an enjoyable, light read.	2000-10-22

Her characters are not always the most likeable  people and they certainly do things in this book that have you clucking  your tongue.
