I am not a big mystery buff so I have only read a couple of Ms. Wesley's Tamara Hale mysteries but this book was excellent.  I highly recommend this book.  I hope that Ms. Wesley will continue to write fiction.  This was a book that was easy to relate too.  I  can't wait for the next one!!!	1999-10-11

Twice just because I wanted to and the last time with my Book Club.  Eric Jerome Dickey is a great writer.  He understands the male and female perspective.  There is  something for everyone in his books.  I have read everything he has written  and am certainly a fan for life.<br />This book is a must read, again and  again.  Keep up the good work and I can't wait to read what you come up  with next.	1998-12-24

I have read all of his books and this is the second time I have read &quot;Friends and Lovers.&quot;  I feel like I know these characters, Leonard and Tyrel as  well as Shelby and Debra.  I heard that a movie was being made out of this  book and I sure hope that is true.  This was a great (although sad at  times) book.  I look forwarding to reading Mr. Dickey's future  works.<br />Keep up the great work.	1998-12-07

I guess I must be in re-read mode these days because the last 3 books I have read have been books I had read before.  I recently read &quot;The Itch&quot; which I truly enjoyed and decided I needed to read &quot;Good  Hair&quot; again.  I thoroughly enjoyed it the second time around.   <br />Alice Andrews was a strong woman who valued her relationship and even  though it was hard, she made it work even after her fiance had cheated.  I  have always been of the mindset that it is harder to stay and try to work  things out but if you value your relationship you should try to make it  work and that is what she did. I don't think that makes her stupid, I think  that makes her strong. I have enjoyed both of Benilde Little's books and  look forward to the next one.	1998-11-30

Even though Reesy and Misty were opposites in alot of regards (Misty was focused career-wise and a mess when it came to relationships and Reesy was flaky in regards to careers and  tough as nails in relationships) I could definitely see how they really  clicked.  They always had each others backs.  Their friendship/relationship  reminds me of my relationship with friends that on the surface we may seem  to be so different but when all is said and done we are always there for  each other.<br />I loved this book and will probably read it again. I highly  recommend this book, especially for a good friend.	1998-11-20

I have to say that I was slightly dissappointed.  All the &quot;Gingersnaps&quot; had some serious issues.  Aletha was totally  manipulative, jealous, controlling and demanding. I could find no redeeming  qualities in her character at all.  There was no reason that I could see to  even have Veronica's character in the book other than to show the  connection between her and Marshall's lover Eric.  The idea of Louise, as  an ex-nun who had a child out of wedlock and had never married writing a  book about how to get and keep a good black man was totally inplausible.   Debra was another one that I felt really had no reason to be in the book.   Her character along with Veronica's were never really developed.  Janeen  had to be naive and just plain blind to not know that Marshall was gay.   The way his character was described in the book it was as if it was so  obvious that you had to be deaf, dumb and blind not to pick up on it.   Desiree was the only character in the book who did not seem to have major  &quot;issues.&quot; Overall, the book was okay.  I think there were too  many characters to the point that some were not really developed at all. I  will be interested to read this authors next effort.	1998-11-13

Once I picked this book up I hated to put it down. I could certainly feel for Hope because that sister was truly going through some things.  She was  struggling with an identity crisis, racial issues, work issues and  relationship issues.  That's enough to make anybody lose it.<br />Ms.  McClarin, please don't make us wait too long for your next novel.<br />I  highly recommend this one.	1998-11-02

All I can say is &quot;Can I please meet a man like Fire?&quot;  The  characters in this story were so well developed, especially Fire and  Sylvia.

As a certifiable make-up junkie, I am always interested when new books  about Cosmetics come out.  As an African-American female, I especially am  interested in ones that cater specifically to me.  I have to say I was  dissappointed in this book.  I was hoping to see more makeovers with  specific how to information.  This book dealt more with Mr. Wells  interaction with certain celebraties than it did with makeup techniques and  looks.  There were really only 3 makeovers in the book, one for light  complected women, medium complected women and dark skinned complected  women. There were no day versus evening looks or how tos in regards to  changing or updating looks.  <br />There were also more drawings than there  were actual pictures so I did not find this book to be all that  helpful.<br />I think Mr. Wells is definitely a very talented makeup artist, I  have seen his work in numerous magazines, however, this book just did not  give me what I was looking for.	1998-10-19

I  thought that Jordan's issues with his relationship with Kimberly were right  on the money.   I think deciding to get into an interracial relationship  would be a very difficult situation for anyone, especially when society as  a whole still seems to have such a problem with it.

He seemed to be a real wimp.  My bookclub read this book and none of us liked it.  Furthermore, Faye was a very strong, independent character.  Why did he have her character get pregnant before they were married?  Was she trying to trap him or was she just plain stupid when it came to birth control?

This book is really pegged as a book dealing with relationships from a male point of view but it really dealt more with Bobby's Radio career than anything else.  We initially liked Faye's character because she was very strong, independent and career oriented but at the end when she was suddenly pregnant, that didn't sit very well with us.  She certainly didn't need to trap Bobby at that point and it didn't make sense that she would intentionally get pregnant before they got married.  It seemed as if the ending was just thrown together with very little thought.  I hope the next book is better.	1998-06-29
