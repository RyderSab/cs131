I read this book when it came out in 1995, when I was 13.  I thought this was an awesome book, with well-introduced characters (except, maybe, for &quot;Spidey&quot;...), a good plot, and a sinister antagonist: a camera.  Nickelodeon's &quot;Are You Afraid of the Dark?&quot; had an episode  (&quot;The Tale of the Curious Camera&quot;) that was almost a complete  copy of this story, but honestly, I don't know which came up with the idea  first.  I've always wondered about if a camera could do something  supernatural, and this is one of the reasons why I ever did.  Right now I  am currently reading Stephen King's novella &quot;The Sun Dog&quot; in  &quot;Four Past Midnight&quot;, another supernatural camera story.  I can  only hope that that Official Boy Scouts camera I bought from an antique  shop isn't posessed...	2000-04-29

In time (up until today, 4/28/00) I read the following:  Graveyard Shift (a very dark, gory, and spooky breathtaker of the  underground world). Night Surf (a grim look at how people survive in  stressful situations). I Am The Doorway (a gruesome &quot;what-if&quot;  story of what a space mission's penalties can be like). The Mangler  (because of this story of a Hadley-Watson Model 6 Steam Ironer and Folder,  I'm never going to look at a laundry factory the same way again...). The  Boogeyman (in addition to what I've already said about this dark  memoir-like story, I am scared of closets in dark rooms now). Gray Matter  (no comment, though I have to admit I never really *was* fond of beer...).  Battleground (a tale of the bizarre possibilities of life, toys, and  death). Trucks (a very scary tale about automobiles--what if it could  happen?). Sometimes They Come Back (an unforgettable story of time and its  victims... and allies... should have even been a novel!). Strawberry Spring  (read it and find out how good this plain &quot;wow&quot;-zer is). The  Ledge (an acrophobic tale that rendered me afraid of heights...). The  Lawnmower Man (the movie has NOTHING to do with this super twisted and  scary story of the bizarre). Quitters, Inc. (a story of a great way to quit  smoking--I never have smoked, and now I never will...). I Know What You  Need (a story that makes you wonder more than once if you can *really*  trust just anybody). Children of the Corn (a tale of an abandoned town...  or is it *really* abandoned?--don't see any of the movies). The Man Who  Loved Flowers (another &quot;wow&quot;-zer--also a mystery).  All in all,  the book was extremely spooky and chilling.  The amount of sleepless nights  it has given me is more than I care to explain, but you know what I mean...   If you want genuine scares, read this book.  If you want the supernatural,  science fiction, mystery, gorefest, and/or any other forms of genuine  horror, read this book.

It was extremely slow for the first 3 chapters (which I have tried to read about 10 times since I first got this book two years ago), so I skipped them and  went for chapter 4.  I started this on April 19th, somewhere in the middle  of the day, and I finished it on the night of April 21st.  The suspense was  killing me!  For being Stephen King's third full-length book ever written,  I have to say that this was more fast and furious than his later ones or  his Richard Bachman novels.  Some novels tend to take a long, long time to  introduce each character, so when the strange events and phenomena begin,  we can more easily notice the changes in them.  This book takes a while to  introduce them, but it has the strange phenomena running parallel to this  so we see clearly that strange things are happening, and at the same time,  we get to know more about the characters.  And what introductions to the  characters, as well: Wendy, cracking up over how the Overlook Hotel is  eating away at the family's sanity as well as their relationships and  friendships; Jack, an ex-alcoholic, now deeply feeling the need to hit the  bottle again as he falls apart from the strange occurences in the Overlook;  Danny, who has this strange power, is slowly cracking up over the strange  phenomena that is communicating through him and to him; and finally, the  Overlook itself... Well, I guess I should not give away too much about  this.  Instead of writing all this, I could have summed it up with these 11  words: scary, suspensful, action-packed, surprising, haunting, spooky, and  well-introduced.  Oh, well.  In even simpler terms, I say, read it.   ...redrum...  ...Redrum... ...REDRUM... ...REDRUM-REDRUM...  ...REDRUMREDRUMREDRUMREDRUM!	2000-04-23

I bought this book recently, and read the first part of it, and was bored.  Then a friend of mine told me about the subject matter of the later parts of the book, and I  was passionate to read it.  So today, April 11, 2000, I began reading it at  around 5:30 in the morning and finished it at 6:30 at night.  I read the  last few pages with shallow breaths and wide eyes, and when I was done, I  put it down and took a deep breath.  What a way of living!  I am amazed.  I  have previously read Cycle of the Werewolf, The Green Mile, and Desperation  (as well as many short stories in Night Shift, Skeleton Crew, and  Nightmares and Dreamscapes), but none of these amount to the incredible  power that Stephen King can put into his work.  For those of you who think  King is an all-out horror writer, THINK AGAIN!  These books are...  Something else.  Not to give anything away, but due to the subject matter,  they may make some people think that they are fantasy.  After reading just  the first one, though, you may think otherwise.  I have a whole new way of  looking at life now.  By the time many people read this review, I will be  deeply into The Dark Tower II: The Drawing of the Three.  Soon enough I  will be reading III, then IV, and the three more to come!  Stephen King,  you are incredible.  Simply put, this book ROCKS!	2000-04-11

I have only read two other Stephen King books: The Green Mile and Cycle of the Werewolf.  I gave both of them a &quot;Good, but...&quot;  review.  Then I read Desperation, and was amazed.  It sounded pretty boring  at first, but as I kept on reading, I didn't want to stop.  Before I knew  it, I was done with it.  Now right after I read a book or see a movie, I  like it or hate it.  But as time passes, I realize how much I like (or  hate) it.  So I waited a week or so, and I realized how much I loved it.   The characters are so well introduced, and the hatred that builds inside  you for the antagonist is incredible.  Now I am extremely afraid to go to  any western state.  I swear, if I see so much as a vulture, a coyote, a  spider, or a mine, I will freak out and run for my dear life.  I guarantee  to anyone who reads this book: you will like it.

I am a big Dean Koontz fan, and was wicked excited to see this book.  However, this book has it's flaws: one major flaw is that it tells WAY too much stuff about his novels, i.e. secrets  that you learn in the climax of the suspense are told throughout the book.   What's more, it was made in 1994, it has missed a lot of newer books since  then, including Dark Rivers of the Heart, Intensity, TickTock, Sole  Survivor, Fear Nothing, Seize the Night, and False Memory.  It should be  revised every time Koontz comes out with a new book.  There is plenty more  I need to know about Koontz than is told here, therefore it could stand  some improvements.  Oh, well.

By the way, don't  read it if you have a weak stomach, if you are afraid of the dark, and if  you don't believe in the unknown.

Jeffrey(rejeffrey@aol.com), a fellow reviewer who is rather half-witted: Of COURSE this is the same story as the movie!  That's why it's called a  &quot;novelization,&quot; brainiac!  If you had a few more brain cells, you  might have read in the back of the book that Dean R. Koontz was paid to  make a novelization of the movie!                                              As for the second part of this review, I will give my comments:  I liked  the book.  Normally I hate reading novelizations of movies, but in this  case, seeing that Koontz wrote it and all, I don't mind.  There is ALWAYS  sex in his novels, but this is one had the most, following Night Chills,  The Vision, and Whispers.  This book was very scary and mysterious, and  recalled another famous book: Rosemary's Baby.  All in all, I liked it.   The sex and ways that some characters acted was a little off, but it  deserved at least 4 1/2 stars.	2000-02-22

The only downer was it was a little too quiet, the suspense is somewhat low, and some of the subplots were a little unclear. Christopher Snow is cool, though.  And for God's sake, DON'T TALK ABOUT MONKEYS IN MOONLIGHT  BAY  AT NIGHT!	2000-01-26

The suspense is chilling, the people are so realistic, and the psychology is astonishing.  Like Watchers, Koontz shows us the opinions of both the  good guys and the bad guys, showing us just what the BIG story is.  Anyone  who is a fan of Dean Koontz, don't ask questions about this book, just READ  IT.  The no-brainer(roboco@flash.net) who said that this book was boring,  non-horrifying, and predictable, is full of it.  Well, anyone who takes his  review for granted, don't; he knows nothing.  JUST READ THIS BOOK!	2000-01-23
