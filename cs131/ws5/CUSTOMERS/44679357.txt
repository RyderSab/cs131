US	44679357	REO3JJ4IO20IB	0516273477	279128143	Halloween (True Books : Holidays)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Treat	Like her book on Thanksgiving, Meachen Rau`s HALLOWEEN is wonderfully well researched, and is completed by a glossary, additional references, index; and, due to the nature of the holiday, safety tips.  Even grownups arelikely to learn a new thing or two about this ancient celebration, from its ancient Celtic and Roman origins,  Christian transformation in the middle ages as well as the current Mexican `Day of the Dead` holiday, to present day symbols and activities in the different countries where it is enjoyed.  Personally, I wish the Jack O`Lantern story were told in more detail because it IS amusing.  However, it is a book about Halloween, not Jack, and Ms Meachem Rau manages to pack in the facts, while keeping the text interesting and readable.  Larger print and a glossary help young readers, while the many full-colored pictures and map will keep the attention of those who enjoy being read aloud to.  <BR>Thanksgiving is coming up next and I heartily recommend A  True Book THANKSGIVING, as well.	2001-11-11
US	44679357	RBJPK2GUNRFIF	0553212443	419595190	A Christmas Carol	Books	5	2	3	N	N	A Timeless Christmas Tradition	Master storyteller and social critic, Charles Dickens, turns this social treatise on shortcomings of Victorian society into an entertaining and heartwarming Christmas ghost story which has charmed generations and become an icon of Christmas traditions.  Who, in the Western world has not heard, &quot;Bah, Humbug!&quot;  And who can forget the now almost hackneyed line of Tiny Tim, &quot;God bless us, every one!&quot;  or his cheerfully poignant observation, that he did not mind the stares of strangers in church, for he might thus serve as a reminder of He who made the lame, walk and the blind, see.  Several movie versions: musical, animated, updated, or standard; as well as stage productions (I recall the Cleveland Playhouse and McCarter Theatre`s with fondess.) have brought the wonderful characterizations to the screen, as well as to life.  This story of the redemption of the  bitter and spiritually poor miser, and the book itself; however, is a timeless treasure whose richness, like Mrs Cratchit`s Christmas pudding, is one that no production can hope to fully capture.	2001-11-11

Have you ever been asked a question by a kid, to which you did not know the answer, or weren`t sure how to answer?  Anyone who has or works with children will answer, &quot;Yes!&quot;  This is an excellent place to find those answers, plus a few more for those questions they have not asked... yet. I even learned a thing or two: like why wheels appear to be rotating backwards, when the vehicle is going forwards.  There are colorful illustrations and easy to understand but not over-simplified answers, as well as a helpful index at the end.	2001-10-22

While the text of the `stories` includes some thoughtful questions to ask the child, many of the stories are oversimplified, and less interesting than if told in more detail.  Although the colorful illustrations will engage any youngster, I am also concerned that all the people are depicted with creamy, peach-toned skin. With so many stories packed into a small space, the book is thick and heavy, like a small dictionary, which makes it difficult to hold open with one hand, a manoeuver which, especially if you have one or more children who move, is an absolute necessity.  I highly recommend THE LION STORYTELLER`S BIBLE, which is written to be told.  There are fewer stories, but the writing is better (attention paid to rhythm and repetition, for example.) The author does not talk down to little ones, and the stories (fifty-plus) are neither too long nor too short.	2001-10-22

Is Daisy up to the challenge? Is she really as brave as she says?  The large print text should help preschoolers recognize easier, more familiar words, although this is definitely a read aloud picture book:  the overall vocabulary is likely to be beyond the early reader level. Colorful, energetic illustrations will engage and amuse:  a fun story.	2001-10-21

Fullof facts, this concise, non-fiction picture book includes a vocabulary list, as well as an index and other resources for youthful researchers.  While the text and length is appropriate for the suggested age group, the large print and colorful visuals make it fine for reading aloud to younger children. Rau should be commended for her excellent use of paintings, as well as her choice of photos which touch on the multicultural aspects of the USA.	2001-10-20

It is a lovely story of a little boy whose faith is inspired by the wondrous flight of the swallows to Capistrano.  Last year, we visited the real Capistrano briefly, I was instantly reminded of this book my mother once read to us.  And now I just HAD to share the story with my sons.  The illustrations have a lyricism and simplicity that capture the beauty of the migrating sparrows. That impression of beauty has stayed with me over the decades.	2001-07-26

Maybe at five and seven, cute is just not enough for my sons.  The environmental message with the garbage strewn port is a point well taken, but LITTLE POLAR BEAR with all the different animals from a warmer climate he meets for the first time was far more interesting.  According to my two, &quot;this only had Lars, cats, and dead fish.&quot;  The illustrations are cute, but the story was a little too simple and unexceptional-- no drama.	2001-07-15

My boys loved the pastel colored illustrations of the snails and their &quot;houses.&quot;  We also get to see an example of oral tradition:  the title fable is really a story within a story.  When one little snail expresses his wish to build a really big house, an older snail tells him the story about the consequences of having such an enormity for a house.  Later, much older, the little snail is asked why his house is so small, and he answers by telling the tale.  Not terribly exciting, but enjoyable; and the illustrations are, as usual, gorgeous, especially that amazing and huge snail house.	2001-07-14

The simple and positive text introduces children to basic pre-reading skills that they will soon or have already encountered, and lays out the different strategies they will use as they learn to read, without preaching or talking down to them.  Phonics is included, but we all know that children use other clues when beginning to read, and those, realistically, are included, too.  Many colorful and warm illustrations help make the more visually oriented child feel at home (my younger son.)   This book did not teach my eldest to read.  His teacher did.  And he did.  In Japanese.  Having been raised bilingually, he was not very confident in his success in reading and writing in Japanese.  However, many of the concepts outlined in this book (except phonics) can be applied to reading in Japanese, and he found that he was indeed, ready to read.  Once he bagan to read in Japanese in school, he suddenly began to read in English, as well. Now his younger brother, who is not so verbal in either language, is enjoying this book.	2001-07-10

We read Ms Cole`s MAGIC SCHOOL BUS VISITS A BEEHIVE back to back with this.  The comparison is too great.  It would be terrific to see a layout of the ant colony`s system of tunnels and chambers.  Also, no mention is made of the drones:  in the story Phoebe says &quot;Without the queen, there wouldn`t be eggs,&quot; but without drones, there wouldn`t be eggs, either.  I don`t know if they showed them in the television show, but there were no pictures of the pupae, nor the interesting fact that the ants stroke them and receive a tasty secretion in return.  The book was interesting, but short on information;  more so than some of the others adapted from the TV series.  If your child wants to find out about ants there are better books out there.	2001-07-09

Much more than a tourist guide for kids, this points out local attractions plus a bit of history and legend. Attractive captioned illustrations enliven each page and at times add a touch of humour.  Some of the vocabulary may be difficult for youngsters, but the format lends itself to reading aloud.  Ms Kaupuiki also includes a glossary and pronunciation guide for many of the Hawaiian words, although it seems to be taken for granted that readers will know that Peter and his dog are wearing helmets that ancient Hawaiian warriors wore, though why they wear them, I don`t know (because he is skateboarding?)  I grew up in Hawaii, with local history lessons and all, but even I learned a thing or two from Peter Panini. My two boys enjoy hearing about places they know, as well as finding out about the other islands and some basic history and lore.  I wonder if other states have as interesting geography books for kids about their region.	2001-07-06

This story left a lasting impression on me: from Wanda`s hundred dresses to her classmate`s horror and chagrin at having done nothing when Wanda was so dreadfully teased.  Not usually very assertive on my own behalf, this thoughtful story changed my attitude about standing by while someone was being bullied.  I felt the author must really know children and how they feel and think.	2001-07-05

This is a lovely Christmas collection including popular carols and selections by Dickens, Hans Christian Andersen, L.Frank Baum, Kenneth Graham, Lucretia P. Hale, Clement C. Moore, and Luke, among others.  Nowhere have I seen a book with so many of my favorites all together, although, as with most collections there are a few I could live without.  While the editor assembled some reputable illustrators of the time (1986,) I would love to see a reprinting with the blander illustrations updated to reflect the multicultural nature of this holiday and our country.  Still, on the whole, a good basic compilation of old Christmas standbys.	2001-07-05

The story is clearly told with concise text opposite striking sea green and reddish brown block print illustrations.  I first felt the illustrations might be too dull for my active boys brought up on Disney videos, but I underestimated them and this lovely medium.  The artwork truly captures the simplicity and boldness of the ancient times of Maui.  A wonderful memento of Hawaii, but also a stimulating picture book.	2001-07-05

I got this from a local bookstore to teach my kids some basic counting, but the tourist-y cover was pretty off-putting. The cover illustration shows two very brown children dressed in hula skirt and malo, and sewing flower leis, an unusual sight in realtime Hawaii.  On the other hand, the typical American kitchen pictured, features a rice cooker next to the toaster, as well as a checkered bag of the local brand of bread, which are familiar sites to locals, but probably not what tourists envision as part of Hawaiian daily life.  The traditional yellow school bus driving along a country road instead of the highway is incongruous, unless you do live in the country.  But the picture of the tutu in her lace trimmed muumuu, surrounded by a mix of children, including a little towhead, is how we like to view the passing down of local culture. All this aside, this is a very elementary (one through ten only ) counting book.  The illustrations cute and very colorful. And a rhyming song follows at the end, but it is written in a range that only sopranos and tenors would find comfortable.  I`ve never heard a child sing a high &quot;A&quot; in everyday life.	2001-07-05

Kimo the cockroach must prove his usefulness to insect kind.  Unlike his other compatriots, he believes in himself and cockroach kind.  At first he only tries to imitate what other insects do (My boys were quite concerned when he ate wood along with the termites, but it did not agree with him.)  Despite many setbacks, he finally discovers his own strongpoint, just when things look their bleakest, and is able to utilize his talents to distinguish the B-52 cockroach and gain the queen`s approbation.<br />Aside from being a whimsical take on an annoying, and sometimes frightening pest (have you ever been dive-bombed by an inch and a half long cockroach late at night?) this warm and funny story also teaches the importance of believing in  and being yourself as well as recognizing and using your strongpoints.  Sumptuous illustrations complement this enjoyable story.	2001-07-04

Instead of the usual stereotypical &quot;ancient legend storyelling&quot; literary style we often see with retelling of traditional tales, this legend is refreshingly written in a colloquial manner.  This style, as well as the two-page layout with text on one side, makes this an excellent book to read aloud.  The textures and colors and expressive animal illustrations can be shown to their best advantage.  My boys love all the animal pictures, the humor, and the exciting fire-spouting Sun Guard monsters!  We return again and again to see and hear the sweet-faced but proud and determined Grandma Spider as she demonstrates why she is so respected and revered.	2001-07-04

Adults and older kids will be able to appreciate it.  HOWEVER, it is large, heavy, and difficult to hold open, especially when you have two active children and only two hands.  For physical youngsters who MUST have pictures, this poses a problem which is compounded by the poor picture to text ratio, as well as the smallness of some of the illustrations.  In addition, the book`s very size seems to intimidate them:  they love some of the same stories, poems, and illustrations (more generously dispersed) in the very much slimmer Pooh`s Bedtime Book.  My boys, at five and seven, now (we`ve had it for a couple of years) are still not ready for the big dust-collector. Ask yourself first, who this is for: you, or the kids?	2001-07-04

This slim, light volume with an assortment of three stories and five poems and color illustrations on every page, (varying in size from one-eighth to two-thirds of a page,) is easy to hold and view.  My boys, now five and seven, still find the big book rather daunting, and will ask for the &quot;bee and balloon story,&quot; or the &quot;Tigger story&quot; or the &quot;North Pole&quot; story from this book, rather than the larger dust collector.  And I should mention that the poem &quot;Sneezles&quot; is a favorite whenever we have to lie in bed with a cold, and this is far easier to take to bed and less lumpy to sleep on.	2001-07-04

Every child should have a chance to hear these modern but timeless stories and enjoy the festive illustrations.  Most of the stories, each written by &quot;top children`s writers,&quot; (Angela Bull, Adele Geras, Chris Powling, Mary Rayner, Dyan Sheldon, Martin Waddell) are entertaining and thought-provoking.  They feature people (and animals) of color, as well as fantasy.  I rather enjoy the Nativity told from a sheep`s point of view.   And the one about the king who has everything tells a most appropriate message, especially at this time of year.  My sons` favorite is about a dragon who learns about Christmas from a seven-year-old girl and gives up his people-eating ways. We even read this when it is not Christmastime.	2001-07-04

As an adult, I give it five stars for an average rating of four.  If you`ve never been to Harlem, or even New York, never met an American of African descent, if you`re too young to have heard of the likes of the Cotton Club, the Apollo, people like Sugar Ray, Langston Hughes, Lady Day, or even Malcolm X, your mama has a heck of alot of explaining to do:  too much for the brief span of attention only just long enough to look at the pictures and feel the music of the poem.  In terms of just words, I suppose this fits in the 4-8 reading level.  However, as a work,  this is more likely to be understood and therefore appreciated by older people.  My kids, five, and seven, were completely mystified by the poem, although they loved the beautiful compositions that make you wish you could touch them.  Having lived in Washington Heights, I can explain some basic things to them, but not enough.  The ability to understand and appreciate this book is beyond their capacity at this time.	2001-07-03

The costumes and setting are from ancient Japan (Heian period,) and thus show another kind of kimono than that we often associate with Japanese tradition.  The princess wears the twelve-layer kimono, like Masako-sama wore when she married the present Crown Prince of Japan.  They also enjoy how he and his elderly parents cope with his minute size -- the use of a needle for a sword, and a bowl for a boat, capture their imagination.  And they enjoy it all the more, because they`re familiar with the Japanese nursery song, included with translation at the back of the book, along with some additional illustrated information on ancient Japanese things.	2001-07-03

Colorful illustrations of Thomas and the gang (Sir Topham Hatt looks a bit transformed) grace this tidy little tale, as our loveable but cheeky Thomas learns a lesson.  Nearly every child will understand how Thomas` excitement and overconfidence lead him to go too fast and not listen to the good advice of his friends.  Everyone has felt that horrible sinking feeling he gets when he doesn`t know where he is, as well as his shame at his behaviour.  And we`ll all root for him as he learns his lesson and resolves to become a Really Useful Engine.	2001-07-03

However, and especially if your young`uns never heard a tall tale, the wonderful illustrations will partially make up for this.  When we started to read this book,  we thought those sweet-faced, round-eyed, snub-nosed cowboys looked a little familiar:  this guy is the same feller who illustrated HOW MUCH IS A MILLION? which we like alot.  My boys love the snake lasso, and we return many times to the fantastic &quot;critter&quot; that Bill wrassles into submission.  But breaking-in &quot;Widder-maker&quot; is an let-down after that adventure, I am afraid.  I recommend Adrien Stoutenburg`s AMERICAN TALL TALES for older children (9-12yrs) which has few illustrations but whose style is far better suited to the dramatic and poetic nature of the tall tale genre.  My seven-year old loves to hear me read those aloud.	2001-07-02

As an expatriate with kids, I was looking forward to enjoying this &quot;What is...?&quot; lift-the-flap book, after enjoying What is Easter and What is Christmas.  However, this book concentrates on shopping, cooking, and eating.  These days Thankgiving is a secular holiday which Americans of all sorts celebrate, so it is not the religious omission I object too, but the oversimplification and glossing over of historical events about which even the youngest of American preschoolers usually hear. Pilgrims are mentioned on only two pages, one of which states that they invited the Indians for dinner, but does not go on to say WHY the Native Americans were part of the first Thanksgiving feast.  If it were not for the help the Pilgrims received from the Native Americans, they might not have survived to celebrate. Since four pages are devoted to cooking, I think they could have spared some room for why there is a Thanksgiving at all.	2001-07-02

Each book; except Catch Me Catch Me, which is for the beginning reader, complete with cut out word cards; contains several short stories about the trains on the island of Sodor.  Trouble for Thomas contains stories mainly about Thomas, but the others feature his friends and co-workers, too:  Edward, Percy, James, Gordon, Diesel, etc.  Full of photographic illustrations from the television show, this is a great way to get them interested in books, as well.  In fact, Catch Me Catch Me is for the child who is starting to read already:  plenty of illustrations and repetition of words, which doesn`t hurt when reading aloud, either.  If this were still available, it would be a terrific gift.	2001-07-02

It is very BASIC: the second section of the first unit explains how to click the mouse.  While my skills are a little beyond that, my computer vocabulary is almost nil:  I could e-mail and shop, but goodness knows what those little pictures on the screen were for.  In addition, our system is Japanese, but I am not yet literate enough in that language to even guess what things (on the computer) are or what they do, because they`re all labeled in Japanese.  I have found this illustrated manual extremely useful:  while the names of things might not match up, the clear and occasionally enlarged figures make it possible to easily identify the corresponding button or icon on our Japanese system.<br />Other features include an example web page to visit on the internet, part of their &quot;real-world case.&quot; There are skills and concepts tests at the end of each unit, as well as little projects on which to practice new skills.  And of course, there is a glossary and index at the back.<br />One annoyance, however:  nowhere in the book description (on the back or elsewhere,) is there mention of the &quot;student disk,&quot; which is frequently used for examples and practice.  On the other hand, I have not found this to be a major obstacle in understanding the concepts and explanations in this book.	2001-06-26

Children may or may not notice, but adults surely will, the similarities between the garden of Eden and the rabbits garden.  Two of the worlds most contented bunnies live together in the worlds most beautiful garden.  They may eat their fill of the carrots there; but, cautions the elderly rabbit before he leaves them to go on a trip, do not try to eat the apples in the tree, else the fox should get the bunnies.  Unfortunately, he doesn`t tell them what to do if they can`t find anymore carrots.  Nor does he know about the snake in the apple tree.  Fortunately, unlike the serpent in Eden, this is a kindly and generous snake. My five- and seven-year old sons enjoyed the stereotype bashing snake, as well as how he ingeniously rescues the bunnies from a hungry fox.  My words will not do that simple picture justice:  suffice to say it is Lionni: witty and startling and memorable.	2001-06-18

As a rehash of the movie, it is okay, but the picture book format highlights the dated qualities of the film.  Characters are often shown in Victorian dramatic poses, mouth agape, which diminishes, rather than enlivens the text.  Also, I miss the comical scene of Snow White, who, due to her relative height, must stretch out across several of the dwarfs` beds lined up next to each other, in order to take a nap.  There are other, better versions of this fairy tale for small children, so don`t go out of your way for this one.	2001-06-17

They`re trying to give their unique teacher a surprise birthday party and need to get to the bakery for the cake.  When they finally reach their destination, the unstable bus suddenly shrinks, with everyone in it, to the size of a moth.  They dodge the baker`s fly swatter and Ms Frizzle while using kitchen chemistry to get the job done.  My boys and I miss the volume of information and mini &quot;reports&quot; of the original series, but they still learn and have fun at the same time.  They have a new respect for cooking, as edible chemistry.  And the baking soda experiment at the back of the book is a rainy day standby in our household:  we love the fizz from the Frizz!	2001-06-14

My kids adore the cartoon bubbles and short &quot;reports&quot; from the students in the story.  Their teacher, Ms Frizzle, is an amazing character who challenges her pupils and leads them on amazing fieldtrips.  Her equally fascinating wardrobe changes with each subject and situation.  All this has made it a read-aloud favorite since my eldest was three. In ON THE OCEAN FLOOR, the inimitable school bus undergoes several transformations as it transports us to and through the ocean; from tidal pools, down to the deep ocean floor, and, after a brief visit to a tropical island, home.  I was touched by the inclusion of a specimen of fish, well known in my home state of Hawaii.  However, I must say OUR lifeguards are nothing like Lenny, who, unlike the rest of the book, is definitely lacking on several points.  Real lifeguards patrol their strip of beach and keep watch over the waters from their perch.  They also patiently answer my children`s questions about the local sea life (most recently, about jellyfish) and just as patiently patch up even the smallest of &quot;boo-boos.&quot;  Minus one star for Lenny.	2001-06-14

What we have here is only the script,which is the one constant of a play.  Doesn`t anyone else wonder what went on with Catherine`s and Claire`s mother, assuming that there is only one Mrs. Robert;  or what went on in Claire and Robert`s or Claire and Catherine`s past relationships? Auburn`s spare and straightforward script gracefully gives actors and directors the freedom to decide on and flesh out the characters` inner lives on their own.  This humility and trust  is one of the marks of good theatre. What a treat, as well as a task, this must be to work on!  Furthermore, the lack of specifics in much of the characters` backgrounds contributes to the universality of the play.  The examination of human experience, love, and choices is always great drama.  This play, for all its references to science and math, really comes down to those basics.  The genius of the play lies in its ability to communicate this to all manner of people.	2001-06-12

Usually my youngest will at least look at the pictures, but he found the baby doll-faced children, some of them with no pupils to their eyes (at least that is what I think he found scary about their eyes,) off-putting.

Even now that they are too big for anything but the occasional nap in the car or when they`re sick, the topic of the open-eyed fish nap still comes up.

I barely have time to keep up with the front page, but managed somehow, to read from cover to cover, this full-fledged novel in less than a week. In the microcosm that is New York, he elaborates on the human condition, and makes us aware of our common humanity.  For who, at some point in their life has not wanted to escape?  To what do we escape?  And do we really succeed?  Despite the questions, there is an underlying optimism, perhaps because of the everpresent love among the characters, that I often find missing in &quot;great&quot; books.

Simple and basic-- it does not purport to be anything else,  this handbook by Dave Linsay has gone beyond his initial goal of sharing his knowledge and experience with contemporaries eager to know how to become a webmaster/mistress.   He helps to bridge the gap between the ability to e-mail and surf the internet, and ignorance and (I`ll admit, irrational,) fear of all the rest of the stuff that appears on the monitor.  In the first few pages, I discovered to my chagrin, that &quot;html&quot; is not &quot;hotmail,&quot; abbreviated (subliminal misconstruction there) and learned the significance of those greater and less than signs whose sudden appearance had me in a cold sweat last time I inadvertently bumped or clicked something other than the alphabet while word-processing on our ancient MAC.   <br />Clear, economically written (in many aspects,) streamlined:  he`s collected a wealth of information and techniques and reorganized it in a digestible form.  Even my Japanese husband can utilize Dave`s tutorial on creating a web page.  The layout anticipates his intended readers` needs:  chapters and headings are written and organized so that one may jump about,  related figures face each other when possible, and advice boxes are a useful preventative of common errors.  Another helpful and encouraging feature is the use of his own real and accessible homepage as an example.  The glossary in back is a plus, as are the appendices which include addresses where one can get free stuff to help with the site.  He also includes the address to his site where you can access links and keep up to date. I can`t say what computer geeks (no offense intended-- I was once a geek, myself; then motherhood happened) would make of this book, although they could probably gain some tips on making their instructions more brief AND understandable, but I think this should satisfy the needs of his intended audience and thensome.  Now, even such as I can create a homepage to make my mother proud ( she, has just learned to e-mail, herself.)  And, empowered by the skills and vocabulary, I now have the confidence to learn more about those other inscrutable computer things.	2001-06-01

If you are looking for another Swimmy or Frederick, or even Alexander, this is NOT it.  The usual cute torn-paper mouse illustrations are here, but this is a weird story, and not a very happy one, either.  At first I had to wonder what kind of mushroom Leonni was on when he wrote this.  The story is about a mouse who finds a mushroom that &quot;talks,&quot; or so he thinks, at least at first.  Anyway, the cat`s out of the bag, and everyone thinks Theodore must be great because he discovered a mushroom that speaks, moreover, he is the only one who can understand it.  Thus begins his dilemma.<br />I suppose this tale is a good starting point for discussions about verifying ones facts, speaking before thinking, getting carried away, the dilemma of when to speak out the truth despite the terrible outcome and accepting the consequences of one`s actions.  Maybe this is not so weird, after all:  just not so light-hearted as the aforementioned stories.  Theodore learns an important lesson, albeit a rueful one, and the book is not devoid of humour.	2001-05-30

However, they face closing when Tabitha`s recipe for their most popular flavor might be lost for ever, all because she didn`t write it down.  My boys and I still enjoy trying to duplicate the flavor of TTFF ice cream.  It`s no great work, but it is fun and encourages experimentation in the kitchen.	2001-05-30

My usual refrain is to come out before they turn into raisins, because they`re too small for prunes.  Of course they identify with Shirley.  When her mother tells her it`s time to come out it inspires her fantastic journey through the plumbing (we spend the longest time over that illustration,) and her aquatic adventures.  No great revelations here, but the idea and whimsical illustrations never fail to captivate my dirty little monkeys of five and seven years of age.	2001-05-30

She is chided and teased by her five older siblings, but it is from one of their jokes that she is inspired with an idea to keep it from getting lost.  The little kitten handles the teasing not only with grace, but by responding with a good idea and following up on it, with a little help from her father and a jeweller.  The pictures are as sweet as the tale, although I wish the kitten and her brothers and sisters had names.	2001-05-30

My five-year-old loves the pictures and story, while the seven-year-old also appreciates the plethora of facts, as well.  The engaging and humorous text is packed with information and complemented by lively and amusing illustrations.  The boys love the cartoon bubbles and the short &quot;reports&quot; by the kids in the story.  The indomitable teacher, Ms Frizzle and her morphing wardrobe challenges her students on these amazing fieldtrips.<br />IN THE TIME OF THE DINOSAURS is about:  dinosaurs and fossils.  Obviously too broad a subject to cover thoroughly in this slim volume, but there`s plenty to whet the appetite.  There is a real paleontologist at a real dig.  And the bus turns into a time machine.  The colorful charts and final class display keep us in perspective.  The kids always have questions about something.  Thank you Ms Frizzle, Ms Cole, and Mr Degen for answering and encouraging them.	2001-05-29

The story-text of the original series is at once humorous, engaging, and packed with facts.  Lively and amusing illustrations include cartoon bubbles, as well as &quot;reports&quot; by the students in the story.  Ms Frizzle is a Mary Poppins-like teacher with oomph, and a wardrobe to match, who challenges and leads her students, recurring characters who reflect the multicultural nature of the US, on amazing fieldtrips.<br />In INSIDE THE EARTH, the fabled bus turns into a steam shovel, provides the kids and the Frizz with workclothes and digging equipment, to explore to the earth`s core, Jules Verne-style.  Along the way, they learn geology, but with the Frizzle spin.	2001-05-28

One by one, he takes on various passengers who PROMISE to behave, BUT... It is easy to forsee the outcome when a girl, a boy, a cat, a dog, a pig, a sheep, chickens, and assorted others all climb aboard.  Told in lilting, repetitive passages that small children often adore,  all ends as happily as one can expect on such a balmy afternoon, and with such an amiable host as is Mr. Gumpy.  It comes as no surprise that MR GUMPY`S OUTING is a recipient of the Kate Greenaway medal, with the way John Burmingham`s illustrations pleasantly evoke the gentleness of the lazy summer`s day.	2001-05-26

At seven and five years of age, active, and bilingual at present, my boys enjoy read-aloud books: only if interesting, and in case of the youngest, only with pictures.<br />Twenty-five stories each from the new and old testaments are retold in a format which lends itself to reading aloud.  These well-crafted versions entertain, yet stay true to their messages, the most prominent of which is that , &quot;God is love.&quot;  Veteran storyteller Bob Hartman uses simple language, (which early readers will appreciate,) but never talks down to his audience.  Sweetly illustrated in color and across two pages, both tales and pictures are easy to share.  This children`s bible is sure to be a family favorite for many years.  Sunday school teachers will also find this a welcome addition to their repertoire.	2001-05-26

However, like many others, I was introduced first to THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE.  Having read and re-read them in one order then the reverse, I recommend that, especially in this day and age,  the latter be read first. Narnia is introduced earlier in the second story:  Narnia-- land of talking creatures, mythical and actual, is what grabs the reader and takes us in through a whimsically mundane choice of a portal, the wardrobe.<br />That said and done,  Polly and Diggory`s adventure is quite a tale.  The plot concerns whether and how the children can get back to their (and our) land, despite the queen`s powerful magic-- great enough to have destroyed an entire world-- and heal Diggory`s ailing mother. They tumble out of their world and into others via Uncle Andrew`s unpredictable and uncertain prowess in magic, to witness the numbing death of Charn and the wondrous dawning of Narnia, created through the lion Aslan`s song, and inspired by Genesis.  The childish selfishness of both Diggory`s uncle and the awful Queen Jadis is at once sad and comical.  In fact, THE MAGICIAN`S NEPHEW is overall more humorous, examining foibles in people, as well as animals.  Also, if you read this book, you will be satisfied with the answer to that question nagging at the back of your mind (as it did to me for years,)	2001-05-26

Yet these things still happen in the world today. Every once in a while on the News, here in Japan, we`ll see a feature on wild animals dealing with city life, including ducks in a similar situation to the Mallard family in this timeless and timely story.  The boys take pleasure from hearing the tale of the ducks and their search for a suitable home, especially when they know such things actually happen.	2001-05-25

However, my seven-year-old, who loved the four Harry Potter books,  found them alot less interesting, and our interests our divided.<br />My son seemed to enjoy hearing about all the different monsters, constantly urging me to read about &quot;just one more.&quot;  However, once we finished with Fantastic Beasts, he showed no inclination to hear about quidditch. I, however, laughed my way through Quidditch, despite my total ineptitude and lack of interest in most sports, of either muggle or wizard origin.  <br />Other than the fact that this is for charity, I wouldn`t break open the piggy bank for these, unless you are a collector or heavy duty fan.  They`re fun, but no big deal.	2001-05-25

Thanks to a thoughtful baby gift from my cousin, I continue to do so, with my two sons.  We enjoy finding Babar among the other little elephants and weep together over his mother`s cruel demise.  We continue to delight at his resilience and enjoy with him his first experiences with people things, and always rejoice at his good fortune and friends.<br />While there are some problematic elements, ( as when the hunter shoots Babar`s mother or when he marries his cousin,)  please keep in mind when this was written and do not let this stop you from sharing this classic with your young ones.  Parents and caretakers should seize this great opportunity to talk with them while addressing the issues.  There are many positive aspects to the story and the characters, themselves.  Delightfully illustrated and charmingly told, the one drawback is that the text, while charming for adults reading aloud, can be an obstacle to early readers.	2001-05-25

And jam.  And muffins. This delicious tale has aged beautifully -- how right the Caldecott people were when they chose to give this book an honorable mention.  From that mouth-watering first scene, to the peaceful panorama of the hilly blueberry patch on a fine warm day, McCloskey`s sweet (but not cloyingly so) tale and charming drawings of a little girl, a little bear, and their mothers, who mix themselves up while picking (and eating) blueberries, is a delectable reminder of the simple pleasures in life.  My little boys empathize with Sal`s sincere intentions, and thrill to the excitement of such a close encounter with the bears.	2001-05-25

My boys, who, unlike most Japanese children, have a middle name, are tickled when I read off this boy`s FOUR.  John Patrick Norman McHennessy not only has an amazingly long name, but he is always late. (Definitely something they can identify with.)  It is not his fault, but because of the myriad of fantastic occurrances which befall him &quot;on the road to learn.&quot;  He perseverantly keeps on going, everyday.  He is always truthful, even when it would be easier to lie and avoid chastisement from Sir, who always accuses him of prevarication and metes out some dreadful punishments.  In fact, Sir gets bigger and scarier-looking with each appearance, until the tables are turned in a most satisfying denoument.  He may be too frightening for wee ones, but my five- and seven-year old boys love it.	2001-05-22
