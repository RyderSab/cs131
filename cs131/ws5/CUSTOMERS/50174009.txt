This is often because too many books about astrology are nothing more than \\"cookbooks\\" that list large amounts of information in lengthy lists intended to help the reader interpret the meanings of when particular planets appear in specific signs or houses in an individual's birthchart.  Sometimes, they will include similar interpretations about aspects between planets in the birthchart. Less often, they might include interpretations about transiting planets, but usually nothing about progressing planets.  What results too often from these astrology \\"cookbooks\\" is confusion for readers because few of these \\"cookbooks\\" describe how to identify what the important significant parts of a birthchart are or how to synthesize the information into a meaningful whole.  Without such an understanding, it becomes impossible to tackle the more difficult concepts of predictive astrology.<br /><br />Recently I read Steven Forrest's 1983 book \\"The Inner Sky: How To Make Wiser Choices for a More Fulfilling Life\\".  In this book, Mr. Forrest provided an elegant set of guidelines that enable novice students of astrology to grasp what the most important features in a birthchart are so that a concise synthesis of the lengthy amount of information contained within it can be effectively navigated and understood without falling prey to information overload.  Being greatly inspired by this book, I decided to read Mr. Forrest's next book, \\"The Changing Sky: A Practical Guide to Predictive Astrology\\", which was first published in 1986.  As in the \\"The Inner Sky\\", Mr. Forrest provides a definitive set of guidelines in \\"The Changing Sky\\" that are highly beneficial.  In order to gain any meaningful information from predictive astrology, both transiting and progressing planets must be compared to an individual's birthchart.  As the birthchart is a snapshot of the sky when a person is born, transits are the actual locations of the planets at a time later in the individual's life.  Hence, transiting planets make aspects with the locations that the planets were in at the time of an individual's birth.  These transiting aspects can mark significant events that most people experience (such as the first Saturn return at about the age of 30 or a transmitting outer planet making a conjunction with a natal Ascendant, Midheaven, Sun or Moon, for example).  Understanding progressions is a bit more difficult than transits because (1) there are multiple progression techniques used by astrologers and (2) progressions don't necessarily relate directly to actual locations of planets.  Progressions are created by astrologers using a symbolic time frame of reference.  The most common progression technique that astrologers use (and is what Mr. Forrest explains very well in \\"The Changing Sky\\") is called \\"secondary progressions\\".  In secondary progressions, the movements that the planets experience in one day relate to one year's life for an individual based upon that individual's birth time.  In this way, as the slow-moving outer planets can influence people for years at a time, in progressions, the fast-moving inner planets slow down and have similar influences that can affect people for years at a time.  This is actually one of the key factors used in predictive astrology: the longer a transiting or progressing planet can aspect with a significant natal planet, Ascendant or Midheaven in an individual's birthchart, the greater the impact that a transiting or progressing planet can have.  This concept helps to form the basis for the four \\"nets\\" that Mr. Forrest describes in the eleventh chapter of \\"The Changing Sky\\".  By understanding how long a particular planet can transit or progress through an aspect with the birthchart (as well as knowing which transmitting/progressing planets are themost important), particular transits and progressions can be divided into different nets that represent different levels of importance, either over long periods of time or shorter periods.  A progressing planet changing signs and/or houses may also be significant.  Fast-moving transiting inner planets may act as triggers within the larger scheme of the longer-lasting transits and progressions.<br /><br />Mr. Forrest separated the 13 chapters contained within \\"The Changing Sky\\" into five parts.  The first part (two chapters) focuses on the \\"root prediction\\", which is the birthchart.  The second part (four chapters) focuses on transmits and includes discussions of the teacher & trickster sides of the outer planets, as well as the meanings of the transiting inner planets.  The third part (three chapters) is an overview of progressions and includes the teacher & trickster sides of the inner planets, except the Moon, which still moves too quickly when progressed.  Instead, an entire chapter (Chapter 9) is used to describe the progressed moon's meaning in signs and houses in a \\"cookbook\\" style.  The fourth part (one chapter) is a \\"cookbook\\"-style description of all the possible aspects that the progressed inner planets (except the Moon), Midheaven and Ascendant make with all of the natal planets, natal Midheaven and natal Ascendant.  Mr. Forrest's inclusion of this \\"cookbook\\"-style information is highly beneficial since I have never seen any other \\"cookbook\\"-style book ever include any progressed planet information.  The fifth and final part (three chapters) is a synthesis of all of the information in the previous four parts and includes an interesting astrological analysis of the life of Vincent Van Gogh.<br /><br />Overall, I rate Steven Forrest's book \\"The Changing Sky: A Practical Guide to Predictive Astrology\\" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone interested in understanding a methodological approach to predictive astrology. In my opinion, this book and Mr. Forrest's earlier book, \\"The Inner Sky: How To Make Wiser Choices for a More Fulfilling Life\\", are probably the best first books to read to begin a study of astrology.  I also recommend that you read \\"The Inner Sky\\" before reading \\"The Changing Sky\\" to gain the most benefit from both books.	2005-10-10

Whether you are young or old and you haven't yet read any of J.K. Rowling's wonderful series of books about a young wizard named Harry Potter, then this set of the first six books would be a wonderful way to begin your own journey.<br /><br />Harry Potter's story begins with the 1997 book \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\".  At age 11, he has been taken care of from the time that he was only one year old by his Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, who have a child of their own named Dudley.  They have taken care of Harry because his own parents, James and Lily Potter (Lily was Petunia's sister) were killed by the evil wizard Lord Voldemort.  The Dursleys want nothing to do with magic, and since Harry may be a wizard, they have not treated him very well.  However, just before Harry's 11th birthday, he received a letter from the Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Witchcraft; but the Dursleys won't let him read the letter.  More & more letters from Hogwarts arrive until out of desperation, the Dursleys attempt to run away with Harry; but they are easily found and on Harry's birthday, a huge man by the name of Hagrid arrives to personally deliver Harry's invitation from Hogwarts to study magic.  It is only then that Harry finds out that he's a wizard and that the Dursleys had lied to him about how his parents died.  Harry leaves with Hagrid and begins his first year at Hogwarts, where he makes his first true friends: Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.  It's an exciting story as Harry learns to play quidditch, learns potions with the unpleasant Professor Snape and becomes entangled in some secret affairs at the school.  He may even have an encounter with \\"He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named\\".<br /><br />In 1999, Harry's story continued with \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\".  At age 12, Harry has been treated slightly better by the Dursleys over his summer holiday, but things begin to turn sour when an elf named Dobby suddenly appears in Harry's bedroom to give him a message: that he should not return to Hogwarts this year.  Not accepting the warning, Dobby makes mischief while the Dursleys are entertaining.  Uncle Vernon puts bars on Harry's bedroom window and refuses to let him return to Hogwarts, but a flying car carrying Ron Weasley and his brothers Fred and George arrive and rescue Harry.  Harry's does finally get to Hogwarts, but students begin to be attacked by an unknown force and Harry starts to hear strange voices.  That's when they learn about a legendary part of the castle known only as \\"the chamber of secrets\\", in which a horrible monster is said to dwell.  Will Hogwarts get shut down, or can Harry and his friends figure out where the chamber is?  Look out for Professor Gilderoy Lockhart and Moaning Myrtle.<br /><br />Also in 1999, Harry's adventures continued with the release of \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\".  At age 13, after Harry accidentally causes one of his other unpleasant muggle aunts to inflate like a balloon, he runs away from the Dursleys to wait out the end of his summer holidays elsewhere.  Harry meets the Minister of Magic himself, Cornelius Fudge, but he doesn't' get in trouble for inflating his aunt. Instead, there is something far more ominous: Sirius Black, a very dangerous prisoner and convicted murderer, has escaped from Azkaban prison.  Everyone at Hogwarts must be on guard, especially with the dreaded dementors on the prowl looking for Sirius.  While Ron & Harry can't understand how Hermione is getting to all of her classes (some classes at the same time), Sirius Black is looking for Harry.  When Harry finds out who Sirius Black is, he goes ballistic; but things may not always be as they appear.<br /><br />In 2000, at 14, Harry begins his fourth year at Hogwarts in the book \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\".  This is an unusual year at Hogwarts: instead of the usual quidditch matches between the four houses, an international Tri-Wizarding Tournament is to be held.  Limited to only upper-class students, everyone is shocked when Harry is named to be one of its contestants.  The Tri-Wizarding Tournament is somewhat dangerous to its participants, but Hermione finds herself in an affair with a world-renowned quidditch player who is representing his school in the Tournament.  In the meantime, Harry starts to have his first teenaged romance with a girl named Cho Chang, but his life is complicated when he begins to experience strange visions of snakes and \\"He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named\\".  What is \\"He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named\\" doing?  Harry will no doubt be caught in the thick of it and it may interfere with the Tournament!<br /><br />In 2003, at 15, Harry's adventures continue in \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\".  After the events that conclude the previous book, Harry saves himself and his cousin Dudley from two dementors near the Dursleys home.  In trouble for having used magic as an underage wizard, Harry is brought before a court at the Ministry of Magic.  Thanks to Professor Dumbledore, Harry's attendance at Hogwarts is saved, but the Ministry of Magic thinks Harry is a liar.  To keep a lid on Harry & Dumbledore, the Ministry makes the lives of Hogwarts' staff and students (especially Harry) miserable with the arrival of Professor Dolores Umbridge direct from the Ministry.  Not only does she personally make Harry's life miserable, Harry has to take extra lessons from Professor Snape!  However, something that Lord Voldemort desperately wants takes his band of Death Eaters and their battle with the Order to the secret halls of the Ministry itself resulting in a terrible price for Harry.<br /><br />In 2005, at 16, Harry begins his sixth year at Hogwarts in the long-awaited book \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\".  After surviving Professor Umbridge and the terrible events of the fifth book, the reputations of Professor Dumbledore and Harry have been restored as the Ministry of Magic has been forced to deal with the increasing number of attacks around England from the Death Eaters.  In fact, Cornelius Fudge has been replaced by the more capable Rufus Scrimgeour as the new Minister of Magic.  Professor Dumbledore himself arrives at the Dursley's home to take Harry and has a very interesting discussion with them.  He also tells Harry that he will be giving Harry private lessons during his sixth year.  These lessons focus on teaching Harry about Voldemort's life story, as best as Professor Dumbledore can remember.  While Harry, Ron and Hermione have more homework than ever, Voldemort's war rages and a deadly plot is hatched that involves Draco Malfoy and Professor Snape resulting in Harry being faced with one of the most difficult experiences of his life.  Decisions are then made that will have far reaching implications for J.K. Rowling's seventh and final (yet unnamed) book in the Harry Potter series.<br /><br />Overall, I rate J.K. Rowling's first six Harry Potter books with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend them.  You too will then know what Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff and Slytherin are; as well as some of the secrets about Hogwarts and its magical world.  You might even come across a hippogryph named Buckbeak, a spider named Aragog, a werewolf and a broad range of engaging characters.

And, as is often the case, the 2006 datebook is brimming with lots of very useful information.  Like its wall-calendar cousin (\\"Llewellyn's Witches' Calendar 2006\\"), the datebook lists all eight of the Wiccan/Pagan holidays (Imbolc, Ostara, Beltane, Litha, Lammas, Mabon, Samhain and Yule) as well as all significant Christian holidays, Jewish holidays, Muslim holidays and the civil holidays for several countries: the United States, Canada and Mexico. It also lists all significant moon phases (new, waxing quarter, full, waning quarter and void-of-course) as well as significant planetary movements between the twelve constellations of the zodiac, including whether the movement is retrograde.  It also lists the particular color associated with each day. An appendix at the end of the datebook contains a list of daily magical influences, color correspondences, lunar phases, moon signs, eclipses for 2006, all 2006 full moons, planetary retrogrades and a moon void-of-course table. <br /> <br />Articles contained at the beginning of the datebook include the following: <br />* \\"Walking the Path\\" by Raven Grimassi. <br />* \\"The Magic of Time\\" by Abby Willowroot. <br />* \\"Midnight Weeding\\" by Dallas Jennifer Cobb. <br />* \\"Personal Power\\" by Danny Pharr. <br />* \\"Forgotten Days of Power\\" by James Kambos. <br /> <br />A number of poems by Elizabeth Barrette that are contained throughout the datebook include: <br />* \\"Spokes and Spirals\\", pg. 31. <br />* \\"Darkling Mirror\\", pg. 35. <br />* \\"Hidden by Light\\", pg. 45. <br />* \\"Signs of Life\\", pg. 55. <br />* \\"Breakthrough\\", pg. 61. <br />* \\"Wearing Her Cloak\\", pg. 71. <br />* \\"Ripe for the Picking\\", pg. 81. <br />* \\"Anvil of Hours\\", pg. 87. <br />* \\"Silver Footprints\\", pg. 97. <br />* \\"Between the Worlds\\", pg 107. <br />* \\"Edge of Night\\", pg. 115. <br />* \\"Taproots\\", pg. 125. <br />* \\"Snowdreams\\", pg. 129. <br /> <br />Short articles written by Ellen Dugan about holidays include: <br />* \\"Imbolc\\", pg. 39. <br />* \\"Ostara\\", pg. 53. <br />* \\"Beltane\\", pg. 65. <br />* \\"Litha\\", pg. 79. <br />* \\"Lughnasadh\\", pg. 91. <br />* \\"Mabon\\", pg. 105. <br />* \\"Samhain\\", pg. 117. <br />* \\"Yule\\", pg. 131. <br /> <br />Short articles written by Edain McCoy about various full moons include: <br />* \\"Cold Moon\\", pg. 33. <br />* \\"Quickening Moon\\", pg. 41. <br />* \\"Storm Moon\\", pg. 51. <br />* \\"Wind Moon\\", pg. 59. <br />* \\"Flower Moon\\", pg. 67. <br />* \\"Strong Sun Moon\\", pg. 75. <br />* \\"Blessing Moon\\", pg. 85. <br />* \\"Corn Moon\\", pg. 93. <br />* \\"Harvest Moon\\", pg. 101. <br />* \\"Blood Moon\\", pg. 109. <br />* \\"Morning Moon\\", pg. 119. <br />* \\"Long Nights Moon\\", pg. 127. <br /> <br />The datebook also contains an assortment of seasonal recipes written by K.D.

And, as usual, the 2006 calendar contains a vast amount of useful information.  Like its predecessors, the 2006 calendar lists all eight of the Wiccan/Pagan holidays (Imbolc, Ostara, Beltane, Litha, Lammas, Mabon, Samhain and Yule) as well as the significant Christian holidays (including observed Orthodox holidays), Jewish holidays and Muslim holidays.  In addition to the religious holidays, the calendar also lists the major civil holidays for the United States, Canada and Mexico.  Other listed holidays include Earth Day, International Astrology Day, Chinese New Year and the beginning & ending of Daylight Savings Time. It also lists all significant moon phases (new, waxing quarter, full and waning quarter), significant planetary movements between the twelve constellations of the zodiac (including whether the movement is retrograde) and the color of the day.  Birthdays and decease dates for significant people in Pagan history are also listed, as well as other significant Pagan dates.  As was introduced in the 2005 calendar, a table is provided in the back of the 2006 calendar that lists when it is possible to view five of the planets in our Solar System with the naked eye (without the aid for a telescope): Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.  (Neptune and Pluto are too distant to be seen without the use of a telescope and only a very small number of people have been able to see Uranus with a naked eye, but since it is extremely faint, most people cannot see it without the aid of a telescope.) <br /> <br />People who regularly purchase an annual \\"Llewellyn Witches' Calendar\\" will probably notice several significant differences with calendars from previous years:  <br />1. The monthly articles do not have separate titles. <br />2. The calendar is somewhat larger. (Calendars in previous years were typically 13 inches wide and 19 inches long when hung, but the 2006 calendar is 12 inches wide and 24 inches long when hung.  So, you might have to adjust placement of this calendar on your wall if you like to hang it in the same place each year.) <br />3. Finally, the paper used in the 2006 calendar is thinner than previous years, but appears to be of a higher quality. <br /> <br />As with calendars in previous years, each month was beautifully decorated by the artist Jennifer Hewitson and is accompanied by an interesting article written by a Wiccan or Pagan author as listed below: <br />Jan.: Yasmine Galenorn <br />Feb.: Danny Pharr <br />Mar.: Emely Flak <br />Apr.: Barbara Ardinger <br />May.: James Kambos <br />Jun.: Gerina Dunwich <br />Jul.: Gail Wood <br />Aug.: Jennifer McDevitt <br />Sep.: Ellen Dugan <br />Oct.: Dianne Sylvan <br />Nov.: Cerridwen Isis Shea <br />Dec.: Abby Willowroot <br /> <br />Other insightful articles contained at the back of the calendar include: <br />* \\"Protecting Hearth & Home\\" by Raven Grimassi <br />* \\"Patron Deities of Egypt\\" by Denise Dumars. <br />* \\"Brightware: Magical Jewelry\\" by Elizabeth Barrette. <br />* \\"The Evil Eye\\" by Janina Rene. <br />* \\"Fabulous Feasts\\" by Magenta Griffith. <br />* \\"The Magic Box\\" by Deborah Lipp. <br />* \\"New Year's Magic\\" by Lynne Sturtevant. <br />* \\"The Witch Cleans House\\" by K.D.

Many astrology books provide lengthy lists of descriptions that explain the meaning of when particular planets appear in specific signs or houses in an individual's birthchart, as well as some information about aspects between planets.  Unfortunately, too many of these \\"cookbook\\"-type astrology books don't provide sufficient (or any) explanations as to how to synthesize the information from the numerous lists into a concise and unconfused birthchart interpretation, or how to recognize which features in a birthchart are more important than others.<br /><br />Thankfully, this is not the case with Steven Forrest's 1988 book \\"The Inner Sky: How To Make Wiser Choices for a More Fulfilling Life\\".  In his book, Mr. Forrest provides an elegant set of guidelines that enable novice students of astrology to grasp what the most important features in a birthchart are so that a concise synthesis of the lengthy amount of information contained within it can be effectively navigated and understood without falling prey to information overload.  (In my opinion, information overload is probably the single largest impasse that most students of astrology face when attempting to interpret a birthchart.)  Mr. Forrest advises that to begin a birthchart interpretation, an individual should only focus initially on three key features: the sun, moon and the ascendant; which is what he refers to as the \\"primal triad\\". By using the archetypes of the signs in which the sun, moon and ascendant occur, a basic understanding as a starting point for developing a more comprehensive interpretation of a birthchart can be more easily remembered as more features of the birthchart are slowly and methodically taken into consideration.  This includes something that no \\"cookbook\\"-type astrology book that I had previously read effectively addresses: how to understand a planet's position in a sign and house taken together.  The next step that Mr. Forrest suggests is to then consider whether the birthchart in question has any hemispheric emphasis by observing how many planets are contained within each birthchart hemisphere.  Then, one of the most beneficial descriptions (in my opinion) that Mr. Forrest describes in the book comes into play: identifying the focalizers.  Focalizers are those planets within a birthchart other than the sun and moon that should be given greater emphasis (or priority) in interpretation.  No \\"cookbook\\"-type astrology book that I had previously read had ever provided a clear way to identity which planets in a birthchart should be regarded as the most important.  This alone makes \\"The Inner Sky\\" stand out as an extremely useful resource.  Other guidelines that Mr. Forrest suggests should follow understanding the primal triad, the hemispheres and the focalizers include understanding the moon's nodes and looking for common themes among everything that has been studied thus far.  Mr. Forrest also addresses how to resolve seemingly irresolvable conflicting bits within a birthchart because his approach to interpreting a birthchart involves psychology, not fortune telling; and is commonly referred to as evolutionary astrology.<br /><br />Before Mr. Forrest discusses the interpretive techniques that I listed above, he begins \\"The Inner Sky\\" with some basics in his first part of the book that he names \\"The Territory\\", which contains three chapters.  The second part, named \\"Words\\", contains four chapters where he gives vivid and extremely useful understandings of the individual signs, planets and houses.  The third and final part, named \\"Sentences\\", contains five chapters and is where Mr. Forrest explains the guidelines as I mentioned in the previous paragraph and then proceeds to give a well-written interpretation example.<br /><br />Consequently, with its 12 chapters, four appendices, comprehensive glossary, index and wonderful writing, I rate Steven Forrest's book \\"The Inner Sky: How To Make Wiser Choices for a More Fulfilling Life\\" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone interested in understanding a methodological approach to interpreting astrological birthcharts.  In my opinion, this is probably the best book to read first to begin a study of astrology.	2005-09-01

Harry's does finally get to Hogwarts, but students begin to be attacked by an unknown force and Harry starts to hear strange voices.  That's when they learn about a legendary part of the castle known only as \\"the chamber of secrets\\", in which a horrible monster is said to dwell.  Will Hogwarts get shut down, or can Harry and his friends figure out where the chamber is?  Look out for Professor Gilderoy Lockhart and Moaning Myrtle. <br /> <br />Also in 1999, Harry's adventures continued with the release of \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\".  At age 13, after Harry accidentally causes one of his other unpleasant muggle aunts to inflate like a balloon, he runs away from the Dursleys to wait out the end of his summer holidays elsewhere.  Harry meets the Minister of Magic himself, Cornelius Fudge, but he doesn't' get in trouble for inflating his aunt. Instead, there is something far more ominous: Sirius Black, a very dangerous prisoner and convicted murderer, has escaped from Azkaban prison.  Everyone at Hogwarts must be on guard, especially with the dreaded dementors on the prowl looking for Sirius.  While Ron & Harry can't understand how Hermione is getting to all of her classes (some classes at the same time), Sirius Black is looking for Harry.  When Harry finds out who Sirius Black is, he goes ballistic; but things may not always be as they appear. <br /> <br />In 2000, at 14, Harry begins his fourth year at Hogwarts in the book \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\".  This is an unusual year at Hogwarts: instead of the usual quidditch matches between the four houses, an international Tri-Wizarding Tournament is to be held.  Limited to onlyupper-class students, everyone is shocked when Harry is named to be one of its contestants.  The Tri-Wizarding Tournament is somewhat dangerous to its participants, but Hermione finds herself in an affair with a world-renowned quidditch player who is representing his school in the Tournament.  In the meantime, Harry is having strange visions of snakes and \\"He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named\\".  What is \\"He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named\\" doing?  Harry will no doubt be caught in the thick of it and it may interfere with the Tournament! <br /> <br />In 2003, at 15, Harry's adventures continue in \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\".  After the events that conclude the previous book, Harry saves himself and his cousin Dudley from two dementors near the Dursleys home.  In trouble for having used magic as an underage wizard, Harry is brought before a court at the Ministry of Magic.  Thanks to Professor Dumbledore, Harry's attendance at Hogwarts is saved, but the Ministry of Magic thinks Harry is a liar.  To keep a lid on Harry & Dumbledore, the Ministry makes the lives of Hogwarts' staff and students (especially Harry) miserable with the arrival of Professor Dolores Umbridge.  However, something that Lord Voldemort desperately wants takes his band of Death Eaters and their battle with the Order to the secret halls of the Ministry itself, and a terrible price! <br /> <br />Overall, I rate J.K. Rowling's first five Harry Potter books with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend them.  You too will then know what Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff and Slytherin are; as well as some of the secrets about Hogwarts and its magical world.  You might even come across a hippogryph named Buckbeak, a spider named Aragog, a werewolf and more.	2005-07-19
US	50174009	RCKSU185TKAST	0439784549	162568542	Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Book 6)	Books	5	4	8	N	N	Another Brilliant "Can't Put It Down" Book by J.K. Rowling	I, along with millions of other readers, were thrilled to receive a copy of J.K. Rowling's sixth Harry Potter book, entitled \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\", on July 16, 2005.  And, like millions of other readers, I was barely able to put the book down for breaks and sleep.  This is the true magic of Harry Potter, his friends, his teachers, Hogwarts and the rest of the wonderful world that J.K. Rowling created in her fantastic series of books: the magic to keep readers, both young and old alike, glued to each and every printed word.  This is not the result of hype; this is the result of brilliant authorship by a gifted storyteller who has created a world filled with beauty, joy, surprises, adventure, strange creatures and intriguing characters, as well as dark figures, sadness and loss. <br /> <br />If you have read the previous five books in the Harry Potter series, then you will of course know that Harry's long-time nemesis, Lord Voldemort, finally succeeded in being reborn and called his former supporters, the Death Eaters, back to his side to serve him once again.  This is where \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" begins as England is being ravaged by unexpected storms, deaths and a collapsing bridge.  The Muggle Prime Minister is visited by Cornelius Fudge (the recently resigned Minister of Magic) to impress upon him the fact that all of these seemingly unrelated events, are, in reality, the result of the reborn Lord Voldemort (a.k.a. \\"He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named\\") unleashing new attacks on both the wizarding and muggle worlds.  Harry, at home for the summer with the Dursleys (Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia and Cousin Dudley), has received a letter from Professor Dumbledore that he himself will be arriving soon to take Harry to stay with the Weasleys at their home known as the Burrow.  Harry had not told the Dursleys about Professor Dumbledore's arrival, as he was still preoccupied with the tragic loss of his godfather, Sirius Black.  All the same, whenHarry learns that Professor Dumbledore himself plans to give private lessons to Harry, Harry is awestruck and doesn't know what the lessons will entail.  He is, of course, thrilled that his visit with the Dursleys is short, as he much prefers the Weasleys' company.  However, members of the wizarding world are now living in fear as Voldemort and his Death Eaters, as well as the dementors who have joined them, are on the prowl; but the Ministry of Magic, even with its new Minister (Rufus Scrimgeour), isn't helping matters by arresting innocent people.  Things aren't quite the same either at Hogwarts, which is under tighter security than ever, due to some expected (as well as unexpected) staff changes.  One change is the addition of a former teacher, Professor Horace Slughorn, who well remembers Harry's mother, Lily Evans Potter.  All in all, though, it is quite an exciting year as Harry, Ron and Hermione are now studying only those courses required for what they each want to do in preparation for their eventual graduations from Hogwarts.  Hence, Harry & Ron are especially happy that they won't be studying Divination any longer with Professor Trelawney; but they also each have more homework than ever.  Of course, Hermione doesn't mind that at all. There are quidditch matches, love affairs and the usual antagonisms with Professor Snape; but it is also a time of war.  Harry's private lessons with Professor Dumbledore are certainly not what he had expected, but neither is a used textbook that he is lent to Harry, whose previous owner is a mystery.  Suffice it to say, Harry and his readers learn a lot more this year at Hogwarts; and the final chapters of the book will no doubt keep readers on the edge of their seats as they did me.  If you want to know what happens in this exciting, gripping and sometimes shocking story, read the 652-page \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\"; as you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br />Overall, I rate \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and very highly recommend it to everyone.  I very much thank J.K. Rowling for deciding back in 1997-1998 to sit down and write out her wonderful stories about Harry Potter that she had originally created for her children.  Not only have her children been entertained and their imaginations expanded, but also the young and old alike who have had the opportunity to fall in love with her stories.  I very much look forward to reading the seventh book, which is also expected to be final book in the series.  Again, thank you J.K. Rowling.	2005-07-18

Published in 1975, Mr. Arroyo divided the book into two parts.  The first part he entitled \\"Astrology & Psychology\\", which contains eight chapters.  The second part he entitled \\"The Four Elements: An Energy Approach to Interpreting Birth Charts\\", which also contains eight chapters (numbered from nine to sixteen).  What differentiates this book from other typical astrology books is that it is not merely a look-up table for trying to interpret a person's birth chart.  In the first part, Mr. Arroyo compares the works of various psychologists (such C. G. Jung, Sigmund Freud and O. Hobart Mowrer), physicians (such as Alexander Ruperti), philosophers (such as L. L. White, Hans Stossel, Irving F. Laucks and Pascal), biologists (such as Pre Tielhard de Chardin) and writers (such as Goethe) with various astrologers (such as Dane Rudhyar, David Hamblin and Marc E. Jones), mythological experts (such as Joseph Campbell) and people claiming clairvoyant abilities (such as Edgar Cayce).  From these (and many others whom I have not named), Mr. Arroyo creates a synthesis to describe a more humanistic and holistic approach to both psychology and astrology, and encourages psychological counselors interested in astrology to utilize tools from astrology to assist in understand their patients.  He also lays the foundation for viewing the zodiacal signs with regard to the seasons of the year in which they fall with their corresponding psychological meanings. <br /> <br />In the second part, Mr. Arroyo describes various astrological components, such as the signs of the zodiac (from a more elemental perspective), the planets (from an \\"energy regulator\\" perspective) and the houses.  He emphasizes that a simple mechanistic approach of chart interpretation often falls short when the impact ofthe elements themselves are not fully taken into account, as well as not taking into account how particular individuals may make decisions that overcome what might otherwise may be misinterpreted as \\"difficult\\" aspects, when they might actually be good.  His descriptions of the elements were well thought out, as were his discussions of elemental imbalances.  In the final two chapters, he touches briefly on chart comparisons between people and the houses. <br /> <br />Overall, I found \\"Astrology, Psychology and the Four Elements\\" to be a very interesting read.  I rate the book with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning some basics about astrology.	2005-07-15
US	50174009	R23RE6PO295BJ5	0060000929	632899339	The Earth Path: Grounding Your Spirit in the Rhythms of Nature	Books	5	56	56	N	N	Spiritually & Practically Connecting with the Earth	One of the most widely read and respected authors in Wicca and Earth-based spirituality, Starhawk, has written no less than ten books on the subject.  Her most recent book, \\"The Earth Path: Grounding Your Spirit in the Rhythms of Nature\\" that was published in 2004, is an amazing combination of spiritual, emotional, practical and even political aspects of Earth-based spirituality. Written in twelve chapters with ample footnotes and references, the first four chapters deal primarily with understanding and recognizing what is sacred in Earth-based spirituality: the Earth and all of its many components, from the land, the water and all living things from the smallest to the largest. The most important lesson here is to realize that the Earth is much more than its individual components, which runs counter to Western science and philosophy that tend to view things in a purely mechanistic and compartmental manner as exemplified by the seventeenth-century French philosopher Ren Descartes. Granted, great scientific understandings have been attained by this philosophy; but it fails in its understanding of emergent characteristics and patterns of complex systems as described elegantly by Fritjof Capra in his book \\"The Web of Life\\".  However, where Fritjof Capra presents his book from a purely secular perspective, Starhawk expands this view into the spiritual aspects, including the realization that our ancestors aren't just humans, but also the myriad of single-celled creatures and bacteria that gave the Earth an oxygen-based atmosphere through the gifts of chlorophyll and photosynthesis. For without these, we would not exist. <br /> <br />The next aspect that Starhawk examines extensively is observation.  If one is to learn how to read and understand Nature and what the Earth is speaking, one must learn how to listen to the birds, insects, plants, trees, the ground, the water, etc.  To achieve this, Starhawk includes a number of meditative exercises focused on learning to understand a particular animal, plant, insect or even fungus.  Some may not be interested in fungi, but Wicca and Earth-based spiritualities recognize the interconnectedness of all things, as well as the cycle of birth, death and rebirth.  For without death, there would be no life and no rebirth.  Fungi, which on the surface may not seem particularly spiritual, is at the heart of death and rebirth because it is fungi that break down dead matter into its essential elements so that they can be reused and renewed.  A prime example is Starhawk's \\"Fertility and Decay\\" meditative exercise on pages 163 through 166.  Starhawk's meditative observation techniques come in particularly useful for understanding each of the four elements (air, fire, water and earth, as well as spirit in the center) that are an inseparable part of Wicca and Earth-based spirituality.  I also especially liked the blessing for each element that Starhawk wrote for each element at the end of each element's chapter. <br /> <br />Interlaced throughout the book, Starhawk includes writings from her personal journals involving her life, home and the areas surrounding her home.  These include such things as the nearby rain-fed streams, building maintainable & reusable sources of energy, sharing seeds and plants with neighbors, eating organically-grown food and living harmoniously with the Earth, as opposed to constantly taking from and polluting the Earth as so many U.S. and international corporations have done.  This is where the political aspects come into play as Starhawk addresses such groups as the World Trade Organization, whose policies were designed to ensure corporate profitability (including the patenting of life forms) at the expense of the environment and individuals.  Starhawk makes no distinction between the political and spiritual when it comes to the Earth because pollution, clear-cutting, the introduction of genetically-modified organisms, the use of herbicides, insecticides, pesticides and other synthetic chemicals in the environment are all-too-often harmful to all life, the environment and the Earth.  To this end, Starhawk makes various recommendations for the various little things that each individual can do to help the Earth. <br /> <br />Overall, I found Starhawk's book \\"The Earth Path: Grounding Your Spirit in the Rhythms of Nature\\" to be well written and an extremely useful resource that deserves a very high rating of 5 out of 5 stars.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in having a more intimate relationship with the Earth, the elements and the many creatures that share this planet with humanity.	2005-05-23
US	50174009	R1J08U1U2FDCOU	0385476760	541051725	The Web of Life: A New Scientific Understanding of Living Systems	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Fascinating Understanding of Evolution & Interconnectedness	Fritjof Capra is a physicist who published a somewhat controversial book in the 1970's entitled \\"The Tao of Physics\\".  In that book, he pointed out some very interesting similarities between quantum theory and the long-held beliefs of three major eastern religions: Hinduism, Buddhism and Taoism.  Some people scoffed at these similarities, but that didn't change the fact that the similarities exist.  Viewing things differently from many western-minded scientists has given Mr. Capra an interesting ability to not only explore viewpoints from an entirely different perspective, but also explain that perspective in terminology that most people can understand.  Granted, the terminology can be complex, but that does not prevent Mr. Capra being able to explain the primary concepts. <br /> <br />This was certainly the case in Mr. Capra's 1996 book entitled \\"The Web of Life\\".  In this extremely fascinating book, Mr. Capra pulls together theories and concepts from a variety of scientists of different backgrounds to synthesize a consistent view of the origins of life, evolution and cognition.  The various theories and concepts originate in cybernetics, feedback loops, nonlinear mathematics (including chaos theory), systems theories, models of self-organization and deep ecology.  Essentially, the origins of life (and of evolution itself) can be understood via nonlinear mathematics of systems.  In the nonlinear mathematics of structures and chaos theory, it is evident that chaos is not some bit of random fluff from which nothing occurs.  Instead, as energy and material is pumped into a system, nonlinear mathematics demonstrates how new levels of stability arise that the well-established theories of thermodynamics cannot explain.  According to thermodynamics, entropy prevents self-organization (which is often the excuse used by creationists to demonstrate that evolution could not occur from nothing).  However, entropy is only applicable when the system is completely closed, not tosystems that are open, meaning that energy and material can flow in and out of the system.  Such is exactly how a cell lives: it continually renews itself by ingesting material and energy and releasing waste products. Hence, life itself is very dynamic and continually changing. As nonlinear mathematics demonstrates, a cell is the result of nonlinear stability achieved in a very dynamic partially closed system. (Partially closed due to the cell membrane that defines the boundaries of the cell.)  One of the very interesting topics that Mr. Capra describes is the theory of autopoieses, which is the organization of the living.  Developed by the Chilean neuroscientists Huberto Maturana and Franciso Varela (a former student of Maturana), autopoieses is a general pattern of organization that is common to all living things regardless of the nature of their components (or structure).  The components by themselves are inanimate; but when properly organized and networked, life is an emergent quality.  This can be demonstrated in the nonlinear mathematics of chaos theory where emergent qualities exist due to the network of various components.  What has been typical in western thinking for several centuries is to break everything down to its components, regardless of small those components are; i.e., to view everything as a machine.  However, the failure of this thinking is to overlook those qualities that can only exist due to the interconnectedness of components in a complex network.  In other words, like many other things, life is greater than the sum of its parts, including cognition. <br /> <br />Overall, I highly recommend Mr. Capra's 1996 book \\"The Web of Life\\" and rate it with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  It helps to provide a much clearer understanding of systems theory, chaos theory and self-organization that, when put together, provide a framework that life itself can begin to be understood.  It also demonstrates how important humanity needs to understand that it is not separate from the environment. We are a part of the environment, which has been regulated and transformed by life itself for billions of years on this planet, long before the first human beings ever evolved. I also applaud Mr. Capra's use of references throughout the book that, if any reader so chooses, can investigate for further study on their own.	2005-04-10
US	50174009	RS6L6WLHPHGDE	1570625190	568909588	The Tao of Physics: An Exploration of the Parallels between Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism (25th Anniversary Edition)	Books	5	189	194	N	N	An Intriguing & Thought-Provoking Book	In 1975, physicist Fritjof Capra wrote an unusual book about physics and Eastern mysticism entitled \\"The Tao Physics\\".  Though some of Mr. Capra's colleagues were offended that any physicist would compare the science of modern physics with the religious practices of Eastern mystics (primarily the beliefs & practices of Hinduism, Buddhism and Taoism), the reality is that there are some very striking similarities with the intuitively Eastern mystical view of reality and the experimentally rational view of quantum theory.  Part of the reason for this is that both physicists and Eastern mystics find it very difficult to explain their observations in language (including the language of mathematics) because each of their experiences is not encountered in our everyday, mechanistic macro world.  Up until the time of Einstein, physicists were comfortable with explaining the world using Newton's mechanistic theories.  However, Einstein realized that there was a fatal flaw with the Newtonian view that presumed that gravity is felt instantaneously regardless of distance.  Also, Newton's law of gravity really didn't explain exactly what gravity is.  With a stroke of insight, Einstein realized that nothing could travel faster than the speed of light, including gravity; and several years later was able to explain gravity as being the consequence of the curvature of four-dimensional space-time due to mass.  These discoveries through the world of Newtonian physics upside-down, but as Einstein's theories demonstrated, the Newtonian view was still valid for objects whose speeds come nowhere near the speed of light.  Hence, Newton's laws of motion and gravity were still valuable, but in actuality, are only good approximations that can be used to explain movement in our frame of reference.  Einstein, however, could not accept the views being developed by his contemporaries in the field of subatomic particles because Einstein maintained that elegant simplicity and orderliness existed atall levels of the physical Universe.  Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, on the other hand, discovered that the subatomic world was anything but simple and orderly.  Instead, they, and the physicists who followed them, discovered that the subatomic world is not comprised of hard, independent and quantifiable particles; but of highly unpredictable and interconnected packets of energy that display characteristics both as particles with mass and waves of energy that can only be partially explained through the use of probabilities. <br /> <br />It was the discovery of quantum theory that modern physics has come to some strikingly similar conclusions that Eastern mystics came to over 2500 years earlier: namely, that everything in the Universe is interconnected, there are no completely independent parts, and that human consciousness is not independent of the Universe either.  By entering deeply meditative states of consciousness, Eastern mystics for centuries have experienced intuitively the interconnected wholeness of reality (referred to the Tao in Taoism, the Brahman in Hinduism and the Dharmakaya in Buddhism) once they are able to set aside all other conscious thought and language.  To Eastern mystics, language, which attempts to distinguish between various things, creates the illusion of separateness and independence that is the hallmark of Western science and philosophy as culminating in Newtonian physics.  The notion that objects could be broken down into independent and mutually exclusive, lifeless parts was the philosophy embraced by many early Greek philosophers, such as Leucippus, Democritus and Aristotle; in contrast to the Greek philosophers of Parmenides and Heraclitus who were hylozoists and Eastern mystics.  The popular Western view of separateness is also part of the driving patriarchal, anthropocentric view of Christianity (\\"yang\\" in Taoists terms); as opposed to the intuitive, interconnected and interpenetrative view of Eastern mysticism (\\"yin\\" in Taoists terms) that is also part of quantum theory. <br /> <br />Some portions of \\"The Tao of Physics\\" may be quite difficult for someone with very little background in physics to fully understand, but Mr. Capra avoided use of complex mathematics in his very accurate explanations of observations made in subatomic physics.  He also did a superb job of explaining the views of three different Eastern religions that many readers may be introduced to for the first time in this book.  Though there was a time when physicists and Western philosophers believed the Universe and inorganic matter are static that could be easily explained with simple equations, modern physics has come to the same conclusion that Eastern mystics did 2500 years ago: the Universe is an extremely dynamic and ever-changing reality governed not by abstract fundamental laws, but by interactions of all matter and energy throughout and that matter itself is pure energy, impermanent, ever-changing and ever-transforming just as the Hindu's explained by the always-dancing Shiva.  Further, modern science cannot explain everything; it can only provide approximate explanations for particular situations: the Universe in its totality could never be fully explained, just as the Tao cannot be fully explained.  Overall, I rate \\"The Tao of Physics\\" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.	2005-01-30
US	50174009	R3L38PIE7032GV	043935806X	667539744	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Book 5)	Books	5	5	5	N	N	The Darkest & Most Masterful Harry Potter Adventure Yet!	Fans of J.K. Rowling's exciting series of fictional books about a young wizard named Harry Potter had to wait three long years from the time that the fourth book (\\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\") was published in 2000 until the fifth book, \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\" was published in 2003.  (The first book was published in 1997 and both the second & third books were published in 1999.)  Part of the reason for three-year delay for the publication of the fifth book is its length: at 870 pages, it is the longest Harry Potter book to day.  Also, J.K. Rowling had to endure a frivolous lawsuit in which she had been falsely accused of plagiarism.  Once J.K. Rowling was free of the frivolous lawsuit in 2002, she was able to complete the fifth book for its eventual 2003 release.  Of course, for those who have read the four previous Harry Potter books, anticipation was extremely high for the fifth book because of the events that occur at the end of fourth book: the successful return of Harry Potter's arch-enemy in the flesh, the Dark Lord known as Voldemort, a.k.a. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.  When, at the end of the fourth book, Professor Albus Dumbledore (the Headmaster of Hogwart's School of Witchcraft & Wizardry) announces the return of Lord Voldemort as witnessed by Harry Potter, many within the Ministry of Magic (including the Minister of Magic himself, Cornelius Fudge), do not want to believe that the man who terrorized the lives of everyone within the wizarding community some 14 years earlier could actually have returned.  Consequently, when Harry is faced with a life-and-death situation near the home of his adopted muggle family (Uncle Vernon Dursley, Aunt Petunia and Cousin Dudley) at the beginning of the fifth book, Harry has no choice but to use magic to defend himself and his cousin. Unfortunately, since Harry is still an under aged wizard and not permitted to use magic outside of Hogwarts, it comes to no surprise that within minutes of his magical defense, Harry receives a letter from the Ministry of Magic stating that he will be expelled from Hogwarts; but thanks to Professor Dumbledore, Harry is instead granted a reprieve, but must also appear before the Ministry for a hearing.  Thus begins what is clearly the darkest Harry Potter story yet written by J.K. Rowling because after Harry's hearing, Harry's beloved Hogwarts is turned upside down with the appointment of the very crass & sickeningly sweet witch known as Dolores Umbridge, who is also the Undersecretary to the Minster of Magic.  With her seemingly unstoppable and authoritarian control granted to her by the Ministry of Magic, she not only makes life at Hogwarts absolutely miserable for Harry, but for the Hogwarts teachers.  Further, Harry's continuing dark dreams about Lord Voldemort's activities are not just merely dreams, they are his actual thoughts; which isn't helped when Professor Dumbledore insist that Harry take special lessons from his most hated teacher, Professor Snape, to combat them.  Thus, while dealing with Umbridge, Snape, dreams of Voldemort, ridicule by the Daily Prophet, not being selected to be a house prefect and being effectively ignored by Professor Dumbledore, Harry becomes increasingly angst-ridden and prone to outbursts of sudden anger, as well as frustrated by the fact that contact with his godfather, Sirius Black, is all but impossible.  It is only after Harry finally has the opportunity to understand the meaning of his visions of Lord Voldemort that Harry finally comes to understand his place, but it will cost him something more valuable than anyone could possibly imagine. <br /> <br />I was truly amazed by the amount of detail and depth of story that J.K. Rowling laid out in \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\" as it went beyond all four of her previous books in the series.  As Harry is growing into a young man from a boy, his wizarding abilities are increasing exponentially, just as many had predicted theywould.  As I read through the books lengthy 870 pages, it was often difficult for me to set the book down to take a break every now and then as I was drawn into the complex web of personalities and events that lead Harry to a climax of epic proportions.  Consequently, for outstanding writing and an addictively engaging story, I resoundingly rate J.K. Rowling's epic \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\" with 5 out of 5 stars; and I can't wait to read the sixth book that will be published in only a matter of months from now.  Thank you J.K. Rowling for another literary masterpiece!	2005-01-17

Rowling's exciting books featuring her beloved character of Harry Potter was released.  Entitled \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\", we find Harry once again facing his arch enemy, the very dark wizard whose very name creates great fear within the wizarding world: Lord Voldemort. Towards the end of Harry's summer vacation that he spends with the ever-unpleasant Dursleys (Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia and Cousin Dudley), Harry received an unexpected invitation to attend the Quidditch World Cup match with the Weasley family (the family of one of Harry's dearest friends, Ron Weasley).  After some obvious objections, Uncle Vernon agrees, but is concerned about how the Weasley's will arrive to pick up Harry.  Instead of arriving in a car as any muggle family would, the Weasleys arrive via their preferred method of transportation: flew powder.  Unfortunately, the Dursley's had converted the fireplace into an electric one; but Arthur Weasley clears the way for the rest of the Weasley clan to arrive by blowing a hole through the chimney wall, which he promises to repair to the fear of the Dursleys.  Being his first time to watch a professional quidditch match, Harry is extremely excited, especially since Arthur obtained the best tickets possible; however a very unusual event occurs following the game: a group of \\"death eaters\\" (supporters of Lord Voldemort) begin to harass a family of muggles at the campsite where so many wizards & witches are staying for the game.  Then, the highly feared symbol of Lord Voldemort appears in the sky causing ever more panic among the guests and disruption for the Ministry of Magic.  A lowly house-elf named Winky takes the blame and is subsequently fired from service to Percy Weasley's boss at the Ministry of Magic, Barty Crouch; but everyone returns to their homes and Harry, Ron and Hermione Granger return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for their fourth year.  However, this is going to be a very different year at Hogwarts as there won't be any inter-house quidditch matches.  Instead, a revived Triwizard Tournament will be held between a champion to represent Hogwarts and two other champions each representing other wizarding schools.  Albus Dumbledore sets an age-limit of 17, meaning that no one under that age may participate and as tradition dictates, the impartial Goblet of Fire selects each school's champion.  However, the Goblet of Fire picks not the expected three names of champions, but four, with Harry being the fourth.  Claiming that he did not sneak his name into the goblet, Professor Dumbledore is inclined to believe Harry, but not everyone does.  However, it is clear that someone does want Harry to participate in the dangerous tournament.  The only questions are who, and for what reason?  You'll just have to read this very exciting and compelling book to find out!<br /><br />Each of J.K. Rowling's books about Harry Potter keep getting better and better.  I was very impressed with the first three, but the fourth, at a staggering 734 pages, maintains a high a level of interest throughout with its many unexpected plot twists and turns, and I was impressed with some of the words that J.K. Rowling used that would clearly require a child to inquire within a dictionary to understand the meaning.  Like the previous books, the fourth has several subplots, such as Hermione's determination to free the house-elves, Hagrid's interest in Madame Maxime (the head of one of the French wizarding school known as Beauxbatons), Hermione's apparent interest in Viktor Krum (who not only attends the Durmstrang wizarding school, but is also the very famous Bulgarian quidditch player whose feats during the Quidditch World Cup amazed everyone) and the ongoing mischief from the ghost named Peeves.  A vast assortment of new characters are introduced in the fourth book, including several people from the Ministry of Magic, the new professor against the dark arts ('Mad-Eye' Moody)and the various people from the other wizarding schools.  The book also has several returning characters from the second book (\\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\") including Dobby and Moaning Myrtle.<br /><br />Without a doubt, J.K. Rowling's fourth book entitled \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\" resoundingly earns 5 out of 5 stars.  The twists and turns that this story takes make predicting its outcome impossible.

And, as if often the case, the 2005 calendar has even more information than the previous yearly calendars.  Like its predecessors, the 2005 calendar lists all eight of the Wiccan/Pagan holidays (Imbolc, Ostara, Beltane, Litha, Lammas, Mabon, Samhain and Yule) as well as all significant Christian holidays (including observed Orthodox holidays), Jewish holidays, Muslim holidays, U.S. holidays and Mexican holidays.  Other listed holidays include Earth Day, International Astrology Day, Chinese New Year and the beginning & ending of Daylight Savings Time. It also lists all significant moon phases (new, waxing quarter, full and waning quarter), significant planetary movements between the twelve constellations of the zodiac (including whether the movement is retrograde) and the color of the day.  Birthdays and decease dates for significant people in Pagan history are also listed, as well as other significant Pagan dates. A new feature in the 2005 calendar is a table in the back that lists the visible times for the five planets that can be seen without a telescope: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. <br /> <br />As usual, each month is beautifully decorated with appropriate artwork and accompanied with interesting articles that are usually written by well-known Wiccan/Pagan authors.  This year's monthly articles (and their authors) are as follows: <br />Jan.: \\"Winter\\" by Raven Grimassi. <br />Feb.: \\"Imbolc\\" by Gerina Dunwich. <br />Mar.: \\"Ostara\\" by Abby Willowroot. <br />Apr.: \\"Spring\\" by Ellen Dugan. <br />May.: \\"Beltane\\" by Elizabeth Barrette. <br />Jun.: \\"Litha\\" by Danny Pharr. <br />Jul.: \\"Summer\\" by Barbara Ardinger. <br />Aug.: \\"Lammas\\" by Lynne Sturtevant. <br />sep.: \\"Mabon\\" by Cerridwen Isis Shea. <br />Oct.: \\"Samhain\\" by Arthur Rowan. <br />Nov.: \\"Autumn\\" by James Kambos. <br />Dec.: \\"Yule\\" by Christopher Penczak (an interesting article focusing on thestress that so often accompanies this holiday season and methods for dealing with it). <br /> <br />Other insightful articles contained at the back of the calendar include: <br />* \\"Honoring Our Ancestors\\" by Yasmine Galenorn. <br />* \\"Elementals\\" by Deborrah Lipp. <br />* \\"Altars for Everyone\\" by Magenta Griffith. <br />* \\"The Body as Sacred Space\\" by Dianne Sylvan. <br />* \\"The Witch's First-Aid Kit\\" by K.

US	50174009	R377HRHF6BBH5P	1567184693	840214021	Everyday Magic: Spells & Rituals for Modern Living (Everyday Series)	Books	4	84	90	N	N	A Handy Reference That No Novice Should Take Lightly	I purchased my copy of Dorothy Morrison's book &quot;Everyday Magic: Spells &amp; Rituals for Modern Living&quot; several years ago not long after I began to study Wicca and Witchcraft.  I regard it to be a very handy reference, and have done some of the spells that Ms. Morrison describes within its pages.  Divided into two parts, the first part is entitled &quot;Ancient Arts, Modern Solutions&quot; and contains four chapters.  The first two chapters provide basic information about various phenomena and things that can affect the outcome of a spell, such as location, timing (moon phase, day of the week, etc.), colors, words, herbs, flowers, trees and stones.  The third chapter discusses the use of modern kitchen appliances for preparation work.  The fourth chapter is a brief discussion on the karmic implications of magick with an emphasis upon understanding just how powerful magickal energy can be, including situations where someone may not realize that he/she may be unintentionally sending out magickal energy that may have positive or negative results. (Several examples are described.)  The second and much longer part of the book is a grimoire containing over 300 spells subdivided into 100 topics.  These topics include addiction, anger, business success, communication, computers, creativity, depression, divorce, enemies, friendship, gambling, health, jobs, legal matters, lost items, money, obstacles, parking spaces, protection, stress, success, traffic, wisdom, and many others.  It is important to note here that in dealing with any negative matters, Ms. Morrison always provides positive ways to handle them.  As she correctly points out in Chapter 4 of Part 1 about karma, whatever energy that you put out will come back to you three times as much.  Thus, it is wise to only perform spellwork that has a positive intent.<br />Though I regard &quot;Everyday Magic: Spells &amp; Rituals for Modern Living&quot; as a valuable reference (especially with its appendixes about herb and deity associations), I do have some concerns when it comes to novices.  In Chapter 1 of Part 1, Ms. Morrison's brief description about location, subtitled &quot;Atmosphere and the Working Environment&quot;, discusses the fact that performing magickal work is generally regarded as being spiritual and is usually performed in the presence of an altar.  However, it does not mention that before any spellwork is done, the working space (usually referred to as &quot;sacred space&quot;) should be ritually cleansed, especially if no spellwork has ever been performed there before.  This ensures that no lingering, possibly negative, energies are present.  Also, it does not mention that spellwork is typically done only within a sacred circle.  Casting a sacred circle protects you from any outside influences that may meddle with your spellwork.  Performing spellwork in an area that has not been ritually cleansed or outside of a sacred circle can prevent the desired outcome of the spellwork from occurring.  If you are a novice, I highly recommend that before attempting any spellwork, that you first familiarize yourself with sacred space and sacred circles.  Several good instructional books include Starhawk's &quot;Spiral Dance&quot;, Christopher Penczak's &quot;The Inner Temple of Witchcraft&quot; &amp; &quot;The Outer Temple of Witchcraft&quot;, Scott Cunningham's &quot;Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner&quot;, Silver Ravenwolf's &quot;To Ride a Silver Broomstick: New Generation Witchcraft&quot; and &quot;The Complete Idiot's Guide to Wicca and Witchcraft&quot; by Denise Zimmermann &amp; Katherine A. Gleason.  For more information about the deities mentioned in &quot;Everyday Magic: Spells &amp; Rituals for Modern Living&quot;, I highly recommend Janet &amp; Stewart Farrar's books &quot;The Witches' God: Lord of the Dance&quot; and &quot;The Witches' Goddess: The Feminine Principle of Divinity&quot;.<br />Overall, for its compact size and amount of information,I rate &quot;Everyday Magic: Spells &amp; Rituals for Modern Living&quot; with 4 out of 5 stars.  One final piece of advice that I give to a novice is as follows: keep your spellwork secret; telling others about any spells that you have cast is the surest way to keep them from happening.	2004-07-15

Rowling completed the third book in her famous series about Harry Potter, the young wizard whose parents were killed by a dark wizard, but is being raised reluctantly by his non-wizard uncle and aunt (the Dursleys) and attending the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, just as his parents did when they were his age.  This third book, entitled \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\", follows Harry's life when he is 13 years old and preparing to attend his third year of studies at Hogwarts.  Before the beginning of the third term, Harry must endure another summer away from his magical friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, and live with his ever-unpleasant Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia and cousin Dudley.  Unfortunately, things only get worse with the announcement that his Aunt Marge is coming for a weeklong visit.  Aunt Marge makes life even more miserable than ever for Harry, even though he and Uncle Vernon have made a deal that if Harry \\"behaves himself\\" while Marge is there, that Uncle Vernon will sign a permission slip so that Harry, with his friends, can visit the village of Hogsmeade, the only completely wizard village in England.  However, on Aunt Marge's last night, Harry can't take any more and accidentally causes her to inflate like a balloon.  Fearing that he will be expelled or even sent to the dreaded Azkaban Prison, Harry decides to run away from the Dursleys to wait his final week prior to the start of third year.  Alone at night in the \\"muggle\\" (non-magic) suburb, Harry sees something coming at him that turns out to be the magical Knight Bus to take him to wherever he wants to go.  Harry rides the bus to Diagon Alley where Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge has been waiting for him.  Thinking that he's about to be severely punished, Harry is stunned instead to be told that the Ministry has taken care of the entire incident with his Aunt Marge and that he will not be punished.  The Weasley family and Hermione Granger arrive thenight before the Hogwarts Express leaves London for school and Harry begins to learn about Sirius Black, who recently escaped from Azkaban Prison.  Sirius Black, regarded as the heir apparent to the dreaded dark wizard Voldemort, was convicted of murdering 13 people 12 years earlier and is believed to be looking for Harry!  Will this affect Harry at Hogwarts, and will Harry meet Sirius Black?  You'll just have to read this exciting novel to find out!<br />Having read the first three books about Harry Potter by J. K. Rowling, I can say that the third book by far is the most exciting and best of the three.  The primary plot line with Sirius Black is very engaging, as are the several subplots which include Hagrid's hippogriff named Buckbeak, Hermione's heavy class load, Hermione's cat, Griffindore's quidditch matches, Draco Malfoy being as bad as ever, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher named Professor Remus Lupin, Harry's introduction to divination with Professor Trelawney, the trips to Hogsmeade and Fred & George Weasleys' gift to Harry.  More is learned about Professor Severus Snape in this very well written novel, as well as Harry's parents.  This book is also much darker than the first two with the dreaded dementors of Azkaban lurking about.<br />With over 430 pages (nearly 100 pages longer than the second book), J. K. Rowling's third book \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" earns a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and I highly recommend it to everyone!  I look forward to reading the fourth and fifth books that are already published, as well as the sixth (currently being written) and seventh in the series.  I'm also very glad that I read this book before seeing its film version that opened in theaters two days ago.	2004-06-07

Following the enormous success of the book \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" (also known as \\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\\") in 1997, author J. K. Rowling set about writing its sequel.  Published in 1999, \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" was even more successful than the first.  It focuses on Harry Potter returning for his second year at the famous Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but the story is much darker than the first book.  Like the first book, the story begins with Harry living with his Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia and cousin Dudley (the Dursleys).  Harry is distressed because he hasn't heard from his dear friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger during the summer break.  One night, when the Dursleys are preparing to entertain for Uncle Vernon's boss, Harry is instructed to remain in his room and be completely quiet.  However, an annoying elf by the name of Dobby magically appears in Harry's room to warn him not to go to Hogwarts this year.  Harry refuses to heed to the warning, so Dobby proceeds to make trouble for Harry and the Dursleys who (of course) blame Harry and refuse to let him return to Hogwarts.  Late one night as Harry gazes out of the bars that his Uncle Vernon has installed on his bedroom window, he sees car lights approaching in the sky.  A flying car pulls up along side the window and Harry hears the all-too-familiar voice of Ron Weasley.  Ron and his twin brothers Fred & George have borrowed their father's flying car to rescue Harry.  Hurriedly, Harry escapes with them so that he can get away from the Dursleys.  However, Dobby causes more trouble for Harry both in getting to Hogwarts and at Hogwarts itself.  Then, people begin to become petrified at Hogwarts with eerie warnings written on the walls in blood saying that the heir of Slytherin has returned to open the chamber of secrets.  Can Harry find out who is behind the petrifactions?  What is the meaning of the spiders?  Is Hagrid involved?  Can Harry tolerate the vain babblings of the narcisstic Gilderoy Lockhart?  Does Harry really belong in Gryffindore?  Will Hogwarts have to be closed?  You'll have to read this fantastic book to find out!<br />In comparing the book with the film version of \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\", the book contains a lot more details than is possible to contain within a 2-hour film, and the film also changes some of the details.  Several examples include the following:<br />1. Professor McGonagall (played by Maggie Smith in the film) gives some details about the chamber of secrets instead of the History of Magic teacher, the ghostly Professor Binns.<br />2. Hermione (played by Emma Watson in the film) gets some dialog in the film that was said originally by Ron Weasley in the book.<br />3. Details of Gilderoy Lockhart's behavior is only partially displayed in the film as compared to the book.<br />4. The party given by Nearly Headless Nick is not included in the film at all.<br />Overall, I rate J. K. Rowling's 341-page book \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  It's a wonderful read for both children and adults alike and I highly recommend it.olerate the vain babblings of the narcisstic Gilderoy Lockhart?  Does Harry really belong in Gryffindore?

During that period of uncertainty (between the end of 1985 and 1989), B-52's front man Fred Schneider published a book containing about 76 of his various poems and other writings that he had written up to that time.  Entitled &quot;Fred Schneider and other Unrelated Works&quot;, the short book (containing less than 100 pages) is subdivided into seven sections:<br />1. This first untitled section contains a loosely organized set of 16 poems that include &quot;Purple, Purple, Purple&quot;, &quot;There's a Moon in the Sky&quot;, &quot;Flamingo 1&quot;, &quot;Flamingo 2&quot;, &quot;Love Poem 1&quot;, &quot;Love Poem 2&quot; and &quot;The Glaciated Heart&quot;.<BR>2. Entitled &quot;The Astor Canasta Crowd and The Tawny D'Orso Bunch&quot;, this section features nine poems about the characters Astor Canasta or Tawny D'Orso.<BR>3. Entitled &quot;Giggles the Skeleton and Friends&quot;, this section features seven poems featuring the character &quot;Giggles the Skeleton&quot; and includes the poems &quot;Giggles Vs. Death&quot;, &quot;Giggles and Taffy&quot; and &quot;Skeletons&quot;.<BR>4. Entitled &quot;And the Cows We Often Ignore&quot;, this section features four poems primarily about cows: &quot;Cows&quot;, &quot;Cows 2&quot;, &quot;The Cows Barked&quot; and &quot;Wistful&quot;.<BR>5. Entitled &quot;Everyone Else and Other Subjects That Hold a Hand Mirror up to Reality&quot;, this lengthy section features 27 different poems that go from one sentence to multiple pages and not all of them are titled.  <BR>6. Entitled &quot;Short Plays and Short and Shorter Stories, Etc.&quot;, this section contains five writings, including &quot;Cindy Goes to Mars&quot; (a possible reference to Cindy Wilson) and the four-page &quot;Heifertiti or a Cow Transfigured&quot; (about a Wisconsin cow that travels to India).<BR>7. Entitled &quot;Olde Nursery Rhymes I Wrote Ages Ago&quot;, this final three-page section contains eight poems.  The first seven untitled ones are based upon well-known Mother Hubbard nursery rhymes; but the last, which is titled &quot;Sequence 1&quot;, compares a dog biting a mailman with former Pres. Ronald Reagan biting former Soviet Premier Gorbachev.<br />People familiar with the under appreciated 1986 B-52's album &quot;Bouncing Off the Satellites&quot;, which was Ricky Wilson's last album with the B-52's, will recognize the similarity in artwork between it and the artwork done in &quot;Fred Schneider and Other Unrelated Works&quot;.  That's because the artwork done for both was by the artist Kenny Scharf.  Overall, I rate &quot;Fred Schneider and other Unrelated Works&quot; with 5 out of 5 stars.  Not everyone who reads the assorted poems and writings within its pages will like it, but any diehard B-52's fan will no doubt appreciate Fred's wit and humor.	2003-12-24

After looking at quite a few books and getting some advice from several experienced Wiccan friends and acquaintances, I selected Silver Ravenwolf's &quot;To Ride A Silver Broomstick&quot; for several reasons that include the following:<BR>1. It's easy to read and understand.<BR>2. It was intended for solitary study and practice.<BR>3. It provides basic information on the Sabbats, the Esbats, descriptions of the various Wiccan traditions, important vocabulary, basic understanding of deities, meditations and sacred space.<BR>4. It provides suggestions for writing and performing personal rituals that include a ritual for the cleansing &amp; consecration of sacred space &amp; tools, the casting of a circle and a self-dedication ritual.<BR>5. It provides basic information about various types of divination, which includes some information regarding the interpretation of the tarot and runes.<BR>6. It provides basic spell-casting suggestions that include the use of color, candle magick, sympathetic magick, gems, herbs and healing.<BR>7. She includes some information on more advanced topics, such as telepathy, psychometry, astral projection, bi-location and power animals.<BR>8. It discusses Wiccans' views on death, reincarnation and the Summerland.<BR>9. Throughout the book, she encourages further study and suggests other books written by other authors.  (She sometimes leaves some information out of her book as an inducement for further study from other sources.)<BR>10. She emphasizes the importance of personal record keeping by encouraging each reader to create his/her own Book of Shadows. <BR>11. She encourages \\"webweaving\\" (contact with other Wiccans) using a variety of methods that do not preclude the practical considerations of personal safety and privacy.<BR>12. Also, throughout the book, she describes personal experiences to further explain various topics.<br />Not everyone who reads &quot;To Ride a Silver Broomstick&quot; will like it, but the thing to remember is that it was never intended to be a basis for advanced study nor to be the definitive final authority on the subject.  Silver Ravenwolf intended &quot;To Ride a Silver Broomstick&quot; to be a helpful guide to those who are interested in following a magickal Wiccan path.  Nothing more.  Overall, I rate &quot;To Ride a Silver Broomstick&quot; with 4 out of 5 stars.  It's an excellent beginner's book that will not only help a beginner get started with the Craft, it will encourage him/her to study further and to develop their own personal Wiccan beliefs.	2003-11-23

I looked at copies of my final possible choices in a local bookstore and finally purchased Herbert Schildt's &quot;Java 2: A Beginner's Guide, Second Edition&quot; and have absolutely no regrets.<br />Herbert Schildt's book was written for people to learn the fundamentals of programming in Java as easily and as quickly as possible.  (Of course, each reader can go at his/her own pace.)  After I began reading the book, I started to become accustomed to Java's terminology and downloaded Sun's free Java compiler online.  Within a few days, I was writing my own simple stand-alone Window's applications and applets.  After that, I started exploring more complex concepts.<br />Herbert Schildt's writing style and book organization made it possible for me to start writing a complex, multithreaded, work-related application within 4 weeks.  He begins the book with a history of the Java language; it's relations to C, C++ and C#; it's built-in security &amp; portability; bytecode; and object-oriented programming.  He then explores data types, operators, and program control statements before explaining the heart of a Java program:  classes, objects and methods.  From there, the reader is ready to be introduced to some of Java's more powerful aspects:  inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, packages and interfaces.<br />Next, what elevates Java over many other languages is its built in exception handling.  Being able to track and locate programming errors is often one of the most difficult aspects of programming, especially when the program is large and complex.  Java allows programmers to test various blocks of a program using the statements &quot;try&quot; and &quot;catch&quot;.  Some methods require the use of the &quot;try&quot; and &quot;catch&quot; block because of their potential to generate an exception that is outside of the program's control (such as file streams).<br />The next very powerful aspect of Java that Herbert Schildt explores is multithreading.  Seasoned real-time programmers will be very familiar with the concept of multitasking, but for many novice programmers, the concept of multitasking or multithreading (as it is called in Java) can be daunting and confusing.  Herbert Schildt's explanations of how to use multithreading (and its potential problems) are thorough and relevant.  Finally, Herbert Schildt explores the creation of applets.<br />As your knowledge of Java expands, you'll find it very worthwhile to purchase a more comprehensive Java reference book that contains a broad list of the various classes and methods available within the language.  For this, I highly recommend Herbert Schildt's &quot;Java 2: The Complete Reference, Fifth Edition&quot;, which is geared for J2SE 1.4.<br />Overall, I rate &quot;Java 2: A Beginner's Guide, Second Edition&quot; by Herbert Schildt with 5 out of 5 stars.  Java is a great programming language, and Herbert Schildt's instructions make learning the language is painless as possible.	2003-10-13
US	50174009	R2IZJC6ZRF3OUW	0201354934	245118064	HTML 4 for the World Wide Web, Fourth Edition	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A Fantastic HTML Reference &amp; Tutorial	A few years ago, I decided to learn about the organization and construction of Internet WebPages.  As with any computer-related topic, there are many, many books available from a variety of authors.  I settled upon Elizabeth Castro's &quot;HTML For the World Wide Web, Visual Quickstart Guide, Fourth Edition&quot;.  I found it to be a very well organized, well-written and easily understood reference that can also be used as a tutorial for learning HTML.  In fact, within a few hours of going through the book, I was creating my own WebPages using a variety of tags using Elizabeth Castro's clear explanations which not only describe the correct syntax for all of the HTML tags, but their purposes also.  She also explains the contents of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and touches upon the incorporation of JavaScript (with a few simple JavaScript examples) and the insertion of applets.  (Note: the writing of applets themselves, as well as the writing of complex JavaScript, is beyond the scope of this book.)<br />One of the best aspects of this book are the distinctions that Elizabeth Castro documents regarding differences in behavior of various HTML tags between the two major Internet browsers:  Internet Explorer and Netscape.  If you are concerned about the appearance of your WebPages on the two major browsers, it is very important to note these specific tag behavioral differences to ensure that the WebPages will appear correctly on both browsers, or to encourage a user to use one browser or the other for best viewing results.<br />Overall, I rate &quot;HTML For the World Wide Web, Visual Quickstart Guide, Fourth Edition&quot; with 5 out of 5 stars.  If you are planning to create your own WebPages, this book is a definite must-have, or you can get Elizabeth Castro's newer release, which includes XHTML.	2003-10-13

I looked at copies of my final possible choices in a local bookstore and finally purchased Herbert Schildt's &quot;Java 2: A Beginner's Guide, Second Edition&quot; and have absolutely no regrets.  Along with this book, I realized that I would also need a more comprehensive reference book detailing the multitude of Java classes designed for many purposes.  To this end, I chose Herbert Schildt's \\"Java 2: The Complete Reference, Fifth Edition\\" not only for its extensive library, but also because of Herbert Schildt's wonderful writing that is easy to read and understand quickly.<br />Herbert Schildt subdivided \\"Java 2: The Complete Reference, Fifth Edition\\" into four parts:  tutorial, library, software development and applications.  Part I (the first 346 pages) is a Java tutorial, organized similarly to Herbert Schildt's other book that I purchased, \\"Java 2: A Beginner's Guide, Second Edition\\".  However, the tutorial in this book is more condensed than in the guide, which has over 500 pages.  Some readers may find the condensed approach in this book sufficient to learn the language, but if you want more comprehensive tutorial explanations, the guide is good companion.<br />Part II (the next 539 pages) is an extensive library detailing most of Java's built-in classes dealing with everything from string handling, collections, utility classes, console I/O, file I/O, networking, applets, event handling (mouse movements, button use, and other interactive GUI objects), the AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit), images and other I/O types including Regular Expressions.  Part III (the next 128 pages) provides some information about Java Beans, Swing, Servlets and a helpful guide for migrating from C++ to Java.  Part IV (the next 123 pages) shows Java in action with four example applications.<br />Overall, I rate Herbert Schildt's \\"Java 2:The Complete Reference, Fifth Edition\\" with 5 out of 5 stars.  It has become a constant companion as I learn and work with Java.	2003-10-13

Wilborn three months prior to the books release date, I was excited with the possibility of a Wiccan book for of the gay and lesbian community.  I preordered the book and was happy to see it arrive at my door three months later, but my joy was quickly replaced with consternation and disappointment as I began read it.  Apparently, what I (and many other readers) thought was a Wiccan book for gay and lesbian practitioners is actually nothing more than just one more beginner's \\"Wicca 101\\" book, and not a particularly good one at that.  As I read through its 21 chapters hoping to find anything remotely close to what the book's title implies, I found very little of any real value.<br />Sadly, what the book does contain is often too condensed to be of much use for a beginner, and nothing new is presented that an experienced Wiccan wouldn't already know.  In fact, the number of pages in many of the book's 21 chapters can be counted with one hand.  The shortest chapter, which is entitled \\"Philosophy\\", is only one paragraph long on a single page.  The \\"History\\" chapter is about 5 pages long.  The average number of pages for each of the first 20 chapters is about 9 pages, but the last chapter entitled \\"Celebrating the Sabbats\\" is a whopping 63 pages.  Here, the author spends time describing each Sabbat that includes a ritual for each.  However, for a beginner who might be solitary, the rituals are for groups or covens; and there is nothing in the descriptions specifically for gay and lesbian practitioners.  If the beginner is a coven initiate, it is likely that the coven would have a prescribed list of books for the initiate to read that may or may not (probably not) include this book.<br />The author does mention that he and his partner are gay, but that's the about the extent of what this book mentions for gay and lesbian practitioners.  A better title for this book would have been \\"Condensed Beginner's Wicca For Anyone, As Described by a Gay Wiccan\\".  Consequently, I can only rate \\"The Gay Wicca Book\\" with 1 star.<br />If you are looking for a Wiccan book specifically geared towards gay and lesbian practitioners, I recommend \\"Gay Witchcraft: Empowering the Tribe\\" by Christopher Penczak.  If you are a beginner, there are many excellent books available that are much better than \\"The Gay Wicca Book\\" such as \\"To Ride a Silver Broomstick: New Generation Witchcraft\\" by Silver Ravenwolf, \\"Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner\\" by Scott Cunningham, \\"The Inner Temple of Witchcraft: Magick, Meditation and Psychic Development\\" by Christopher Penczak and \\"The Spiral Dance\\" by Starhawk.	2003-10-07

Rowling.  The story is about an 11 year old boy named Harry Potter, who is an orphan being raised by his very unpleasant Uncle Vernon Dursley and Aunt Petunia (his mother's sister).  Unknown to Harry, he has magical powers and occasionally (and unknowingly) makes things happen that greatly upset the Dursley's.  However, the Dursley's know that Harry has magical powers because Harry's deceased parents (James and Lily Potter) were a wizard and a witch.  A very powerful wizard named Albus Dumbledore had left the infant Harry on the Dursley's doorstep following his parents' deaths.  The Dursley's own son, Dudley, is the same age as Harry and treats Harry very badly.<br />Upon Harry's 11th birthday, he receives a letter: something that has never happened before.  The Dursley's won't let him open the letter and become very upset when they read it, but more letters begin to arrive for Harry.  In spite of Vernon's efforts, Harry finally gets to read the letter when Hagrid (the groundskeeper at the Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry) bursts in to personally deliver Harry's letter, which is his invitation to attend Hogwarts.  Harry at first doesn't believe that he is a wizard, but agrees to leave with Hagrid and his life is never the same again.  He learns about muggles, goblins, wizards, witches and magic.  He also gets to meet Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Albus Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall, and a host of other wizards and witches.<br />What inspired me to start reading the Harry Potter books was seeing the first two feature films based upon this book and the next book, \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\".  I was very impressed with the amount of detail in the book that did not make its way into the first feature film and understood how much the film deviated from the original story.  One of the biggest differences is the amount of attention given to characters in the book that only had minor roles in the film including Neville Longbottom, the Weasley twins and Dudley Dursley.  Also, a few characters in the book don't appear in the feature film at all.  The other major difference between the story presented in the feature film and the book is changing of when things are said and done, which is understandable considering the length of the film.  (It took me about 8 hours to read the book and the feature film is 2.5 hours.)<br />Overall, I rate \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys reading fun and exciting stories that encourage the imagination.e film deviated from the original story.

Since purchasing the Official Scrabble Player's Dictionary, I may still get frustrated at times, but now I have a much better resource for figuring out what I can do with seemingly useless tiles.  (This dictionary has been especially useful when I want to place a word parallel to an existing word on the board and create one more more two- to three-letter extra words in the process.)<br />The font used in the dictionary is very easy to read.  Words defined may be limited to between 2 and 8 letters, but at over 100,000 entries (including unusual words not defined anyplace else, like &quot;brr&quot;), this dictionary cannot be beat for playing Scrabble.<br />I spent a little more money to buy the hardback edition instead of the paperback one: it's much easier to inspect the pages of a dictionary when you don't have to fight the binding to keep the book open to one place.<br />You might need other useful resources when playing Scrabble, but none are as good as the Offical Scrabble Player's Dictionary.  I give it a rating of 5 stars!	2002-10-24

I totally applaud Mats Sexton for all of the hard work that he put into this fantastic biography of one of the world's best rock bands: The B-52's!<br />This full-color, hard-cover book contains detailed biographies of each member of the B-52's: Kate Pierson, Fred Schneider, Keith Strickland, Cindy Wilson and Ricky Wilson (deceased).  It also contains tons of photographs (color and black & white), many of which had never been previously published.<br />One of my favorite aspects of this book is its chronological order: you can read about the activities and performances of the band from their first official performance (Valentine's Day, 1977 at a friend's house in Athens, GA), all the way through the year 2001.  All of the performances for each year between 1977 and 2001 are listed, including TV guest appearances such as their appearances on Saturday Night Live.<br />Another fantastic part of this book is that it describes and shows pictures of all of the B-52's albums, singles, and other merchandise (including promotional items) that have been produced since 1977.  It also gives information about songs that the B-52's either never recorded or never released, such as the song \\"Killer B's\\" that they performed a few times in their beginning.<br />If you're a B-52's fan (like I am), then this book is a total must-have item!  If I could give this book a rating of 10 stars, I would!<br />Many, many thanks go to Kate, Fred, Keith, Cindy and Ricky for making some of the best and most fun music in the world!	2002-08-15

Drew did a fantastic job with his writing in &quot;Wicca Spellcraft for Men: A Spellbook for Male Pagans&quot;.  Too many Wiccan books lean heavily towards the feminine aspects of Wicca and the Goddess.  Balance is an essential element in Wicca, and it should never exclude balance between maleness and femaleness, between the God and the Goddess.<br />If you are a male pagan or male witch, this is certainly a book that you should give serious thought to reading and adding to your personal library.  If you are a female pagan or female witch, this book will provide great insight into the male aspects of Wicca.	2002-03-08
