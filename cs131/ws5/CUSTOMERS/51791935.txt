I must say at first I was a little weary about a book of tarot spells, especially the love spells, but there actually formatted to bring positive results with no harm done, it's awesome how she set up the wording of all her spells, and the spells are simple and straight to the point.<BR>this is a great book for beginers.<BR>All in all this book covers a wide range of everyday life, and the results are fantastic.<BR>LVX	2003-05-21

I actually bought this for a friends b-day present and ended up keeping it for myself and getting him another one, I looked through it and realized that it was packed with so many delicate yet simple recipes, even a delicious doughnut section.<BR>it's not a big book, but the info is. Enjoy;)	2002-11-07
US	51791935	R1MDNCHYN12TPX	1567187242	977643808	Angels: Companions in Magick	Books	5	10	14	N	N	There's some mixed views	Ok ok, so I see that some people are confused about this book, I guess I can understand why, But not to defend her or her writtings but magick itself, the comment below someone said this is the latest fad, and to think that angelic energy isn't as powerful as any other energy is kinda messed up. Energy is Engery and how you use it or whatever you call it is up to the magus, but that's just a rude comment to say she goes along and makes up her own beliefs,NOW what I see that she has presented us with is a book of usefull information on all sorts of deites that are beneficial to everyone once you learn how to work with them, I think that her writting several books on many diferent styles of magick and beings is absolutely amazing. She stands strong behind her writtings and is blessed with writting it and sharing it with everyone. So I wouldn't knock it, it is usefull and I think that this book is awesome, It's not enochian but it doesn't have to be just cause of the title, so I think you should get it and try it out for yourself.<BR>LVX<BR>Seth	2002-10-29

I do have to say I was really cautious about buying another book on the subject, but I was pleasently suprised, great meal plans, weight and training plans, and I've really kept great weight control.

What a awesome set of books, I wasn't sure at first if I would like these, but I started to read them and went through the first 2 in less then a week, Her style of writting is like no other, I actually never found myself board, which is hard to find now-a-days.<BR>The 3rd book is pretty long, but just as wonderful as the first 2, and 4 just rules!	2002-10-02

Kinda Disappointing	I got this book hoping it was better then I thought it was going to be, but it was JUST ok, some of the stuff especially the sacrificial stuff is just silly and should be taken lighty, but some of the other spells(&quot;prayers&quot;) are pretty cool. To be completely honest there are alot of better books out there, I would go to those first. I personally reccomend Modern Magick From Donald Michael Kraig, it's more comfortable and more descriptive, and it'a great starter book:)<BR>Sorry about the poor review, but it's how it is;)	2002-05-22

Now karma does play a role in this but the book makes it almost like that doesn't matter, I think going with something like modern magick by Donald Michael Kraig,is a way better path to take, Magick can not be treated like it's there to grant all your desires like the other reviews imply, It's there cause it's a way of life, well at least it is for me. You can find much better books..Sorry for the dissapointment.	2001-02-13

I really think this book was cute but very brainless.This was a  gift that they requested thats the only reason I would consider getting  this.the spells probably work,if you put enough time and effort into  anything you can make any spell be effective,I've been a magus and  practicing magick for many years now and feel that this book should be a  silly read through book and definately not taken seriously. Remember when  you do spells like this your going against someones will to gain what you  want,thats very wrong.if you don't think so thats great but you'll find out  the hard way:) And it harm none!do not upset the balance of nature.	2000-08-25

I'm very proud of my magickal background and he just honestly  sounds very insecure and you can tell he really wants you to believe in his  way of work,I guess there really is no &quot;wrong way&quot;but I do belive  in karma and when he says thats rediculous I get kinda confused cause any  good magician should be aware of what there putting out is going to come  back in some way. Basic Magick is a pretty good book of his but I really  don't reccomend this one,The spells are kinda dangerous for someone who  might be begining or doesn't know a whole lot about magick.Sorry to drop  the bad news but I think you should know.	2000-07-28
