This book begins with an introductory essay by Goulder himself, where he traces the origins of his ideas. Following this are five essays on themes that Goulder has discussed through the years. Bruce Chilton has a charitable paper that engages Goulder's view that Matthew was constructed around the Jewish festal year. John Kloppenborg vigorously defends the prevailing idea in NT scholarship that Luke and Matthew drew upon another source other than the Gospel of Mark (called Q), an idea that Goulder rejects. Robert Derrenbacher has a strange article where he argues that Luke could have composed his Gospel on a table with a copy of Matthew on one knee and a copy of Q on the other knee, an idea that Goulder pokes fun at while admitting its possibilities. <br /> <br />There is also an article by Gary Gilbert where he notes that the table of nations in Acts two is meant to illustrate the universal reign of Chrust in the same way Roman table of nations illustrated the universal supremacy of the emperor, an idea that was neither convincing to me or to Goulder, who felt that Acts 2 was constructed with Genesis 10 and 11 in mind. <br /> <br />Finally, there is an essay by Alan Segal where he tries to prove that the man in Christ who was caught up to the third heaven in 2 Corinthians 12 was none other than the apostle Paul himself, a view that Goulder has argued against. There is an appreciative summary of the five articles by Harvard professor Krister Stendahl, followed by brief responses by Goulder. <br /> <br />This is a scholarly book that won't appeal to the average layperson, though it may interest those who are interested in Gospel studies or those who have read Bishop Spong's books. I enjoyed it.	2005-01-26

Swindoll does this throughout his book LAUGH AGAIN, which is a loose exposition of the book of Philippians. He substitutes the word `laughter' for `joy' and transforms the book of Philippians into a message that helps us to laugh about life. His application of the first eleven verses of Phillipians 1 is that we begin to laugh again when we place our full confidence in God (p. 44, large print edition).  Moreover, his title for the chapter on Philippians 2:12-18 is \\"While Laughing, Keep your Balance.\\"  When Swindoll is determined to teach something that isn't in the text, his exposition tends to go awry, and that is exactly what happens in this book.     Dr. Swindoll would have been farther ahead to write a book about experiencing more joy in your life and letting Philippians speak for itself. Not only would joy have been a relevant topic of discussion, but this approach would have modeled for his readers how to handle scripture. I do not recommend this book, but Swindoll has written other books that I do recommend heartily, including his GROWING DEEP IN THE CHRISTIAN LIFE and his book PAUL from the stories of great lives series.	2005-01-06

He is a clear, easy to understand writer, and he has some very novel views about the formation of the four gospels. He feels that the four gospels are a midrash on the Old testament tradition and that they are legendary rather than historical. He belives that the Gospel of Mark was composed based on the Jewish holidays, beginning with Rosh Hashanah and concluding of course with the Passover when Jesus was crucified. He also believes that the Gospel of Luke was like a Christian Torah, following the pattern of the first 5 books of Moses. His view of the Gospel of Matthew is that it follows the Jewish lectionary. All of this is highly conjectural, but it is very interesting, and he has me convinced at least about the Gospel of Mark. Yet since we have no actual lectionary from this period, it is difficult to be dogmatic and clear about the liturgical composition of Matthew.    The book really helped me to see the gospels with Jewish eyes, and that was Spong's goal all along. Having said that, I found his criticisms of other scholars to be condescending and disrespectful, (especially his statements about the great Catholic scholars Raymond Brown and Joseph Fitzmyer) and I found him to be needlessly pessimistic about the historical claims of the text.     But in the main, I'd have to say that this book was an eye opener and I recommend it, even if there is much with which to disagree.	2005-01-06

Yet it is easy to read, always interesting, and thought provoking. The early chapters cover the historical, social, cultural, and political backgrounds of the New Testament era. Blomberg does a great job painting a picture of what life would have been like in 1st century Israel. Then he has a discussion about how the gospels were composed and when they might have been written. He then gives a succinct summary of the events narrated in the four gospels, concluding with a nice essay onm the historical credibility of the passion narratives.  <br /> <br />This book does for the Christian community what Alfred Edersheim's Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah did for the Christian community over a hundred years ago, except to say that Blomberg's book is much easier to read. I highly recommend it.	2004-12-21

The authors reveal the message of each Old Testament book, while discussing some of the scholarly issues surrounding each part of the Old Testament (such as the JEDP theory). Unfortunately William Lasor passed away in 1991, so Hubbard (who is dead now too) and Bush recruited six other OT scholars to complete the revision. This may be one of the reasons why the authors ride the fence on issues such as whether or not we can take the numbers in Numbers literally, the number of Isaiah's, the historical worthiness of Joshua and Jonah, and the happenings surrounding the Exodus from Egypt. The authors also seem to lean toward the book of Jonah being a parable rather than actual history, although they don't take a really strong stand on that, either. <br /> <br />The reviewer who wrote that this book supports the JEDP theory was mistaken: In fact, the authors predict that this theory will eventually be out of vogue with scholarship. What the authors do affirm is that Moses was originally responsible for the Pentateuch and that through the centuries, the community revised and updated it.  <br /> <br />And contrary to an earlier reviewer, I didn't find the book tedious at all: It was very well written and very interesting throughout. I especially appreciated the articles at the end about the Authority of the Old Testament for Christians, Messianic prophecy, and the chronological puzzle. <br /> <br />In short, I recommend this book, only wishing that the authors would take a stand on some of the issues discussed above.	2004-08-31

I guess I was expecting a treatise on the messianic concept in the Dead Sea Scrolls and in the Hebrew Scriptures. But the book turned out to be a series of essays by evangelical Old Testament scholars, followed by brief replies from critical reviewers. I really enjoyed this format. The most interesting article was the opening one by Daniel Block, where he tried with all of his might to show that the Messiah in the Old Testament was a kingly messiah all the way through, even in the suffering servant passages of Isaiah 42-53. It was hard to see where Block was coming from, and why he felt the way he did. I felt that Richard Hess did a great job of exposing some of the fallacies of Block's thinking.<br />There was also a good article by Craig Evans about the messiah in the Dead Sea Scrolls (it was hard to follow at times, but I learned a lot about the teacher role of the Messiah in these writings). The last article seemed out of place. It was about the Latin American messianic concept in response to some of those who hold to liberation theologies. The man who wrote that article was quite a wordsmith, and wrote with an engaging style. The female scholar who critiqued his article had nothing but glowing comments.<br />I recommend this book for scholarly pastors and those who are interested in learning more about messianic theology from a Christian perspective.	2003-12-16

It read more like a story than like the dry, non fiction academic text that I thought it would be. I appreciated the small excurses on social and cultural life in America, and the maps were colorful, and the many pictures and paintings added a much needed dose of culture and nostalgia.<br />I should say that I was disappointed at the anti-Christian bias of the authors. They make the great Swedish theologian John Calvin seem like a radical, and they portray Jonathan Edwards out to be a fire and brimstone preacher when in fact \\"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God\\" was atypical of his more serene and calm manner in the pulpit.<br />Moreover, the accounts of the first and second Great Awakenings were exploited for their religious excesses rather than mined for the way these two events contributed to the cultural and social life of 18th and 19th century America. As a preacher and as a discerning man of faith, I felt that these glosses could have been avoided with more careful and objective research.<br />But minus this, what you have here is a fun history book to read. I recommend it with caution.	2003-12-16

This is not to say that the book is no longer scholarly, France does make generous use of footnotes and refers to the original languages of scripture. But it is more layman friendly than was originally the case.<br />France asserts that Daniel 7:13 was one of the most influential OT scriptures on the thinking of Jesus as he reflected on his message and mission. He also says that Isaiah 53 was a very influential chapter in Jesus' life. With these two passages always in mind, France takes us through the four gospels and shows just how much the Old tesament influenced Christ. Not all of his interpretations will satisy: His reference to Mark 13 as a prediction of the Son of Man coming in a first century judgment on Israel rather than a future second coming of the Lord will not command assent amongst all interpreters. In fact, my gut instinct is that not many will follow France's interpretation of Mark 13 at all. <br />Outside of this lapse, the book was a very strong presentation of Christ's use of the Hebrew Scriptures. Recommended.	2003-12-16

He was hoping that it would be volume 5 of a seven volume systematic theology series, but it never materialized. McClain died before he could complete the project. This volume is all we have, but boy, is it a good one! McClain goes from Genesis to Revelation, discussing the kingdom of God as it appears on the pages of scripture. The first half of the book deals with the kingdom in the Old Testament. He asserts that there is a universal kingdom where God rules over everyone, and there is a mediatorial kingdom, experienced either in the form of the Old Testament Israelite Theocracy, or in the life of the individual believer. He points out that even though we are experiencing some of the benefits of kingdom life on earth if we are Christians, we  still need to look forward to the day when God installs Christ as head of the future 1000 year messianic kingdom on earth so that God's rule may be experienced by one and all (at least those who survive the judgment at the second coming of Christ).<br />The book was well written, and was very practical. My only quibble was that in a 531 page book, McClain devoted just 12 pages to the kingdom in Paul's writings. His reasoning for this is that Paul concentrated more on the church than on the kingdom. But Paul still had some important things to say about it (Romans 14:17-18; 2 Thessalonians 1, et al), and I would have liked to have seen McClain compare Paul's kingdom concept with that of Jesus and the Old Testament and the book of Revelation. With over a hundred pages devoted to the book of Revelation alone, and only 12 pages for all 13 Pauline epistles, I feel that the book didn't satisfy my desire for proportion.<br />But having said that, what the book does contain is excellent, and I highly recommned it, if you can find it.	2003-12-16

Hengstenberg was a 19th century Lutheran scholar, and he writes with verve and with a passion for pietistic scholarship. With zeal and skill, he marches through the Hebrew Bible, dealing with the texts of Scripture that have traditionally been interpreted messianically by the Christian community. Some of his conclusions are surprising: That Numbers 24:17 is not messianic at all and that Psalm 45 refers to a polygamous wedding! But most of the time, his conclusions are solid and he does an admirable job of weighing the non messianic interpretations against the traditional ones.<br />Keep in mind that this book is actually an abridgment of an enormous 4 volume German work. It is very hard to find the original 4 volume English translation, and if you do, I'm sure that you would have to pay big bucks for it. This 715 page one volume translation will do just fine. I highly recommend it to Christians who want to know more about this subject.	2003-12-16

Actually, I found the first chapter on how to interpret messianic prophecy the most helpful chapter in the book. Kaiser rejects the double fulfillment approach that many have taken with the prophecies of Christ's first coming. He makes a case for the Christocentric interpretation being the the primary interpretation in each case study. I do not always agree with this approach, as his interpretation of Isaiah 7:14 is less than satisfying.<br />But in most instances, his interpretations are very good, and you can perceive Kaiser's strong evangelical faith in the volume.

She had great compassion for the wounded British soldiers. They called her &quot;The Lady with the Lamp&quot; because she roamed the military hospital corridors through the night, ministering at the bedside of the wounded. She labored hard to make the hospitals more sanitary. <br />But she was not well liked by the hospital staff, who thought she was meddling. And questioning their professionalism. But to many in England, (especially the soldiers) she was a heroine. <br />But I'm sorry to say that this book is not the greatest. it spends way too much time discussing how she wrestled with God;s will for her life. And not enough time on her powerful work on behalf of the soldiers. By the time I was halfway through the book, I was thinking, &quot;OK, when is this going to get interesting?&quot; The book becomes more interesting over the latter half. But it totally glosses over the last 50 years of her life. So I would have to recommend that you start elsewhere to learn about Miss Nightingale.	2002-10-08

The writer attempts to prove that when Jesus returns, there will be a literal 1000 year kingdom of peace on earth. I felt that the author proved his case from Scripture fairly well. But he spends a lot of time trading barbs with Christians of other eschatological perspectives. So the book comes across as somewhat snooty and contemptuous . Which is too bad, really. But if you can wade through the stodgy prose, then I think you will learn quite a bit about 20th century millennialism.	2002-10-08

Chuck Colson is a great story teller, and he gives many gripping illustrations of what it means to love God in our everyday lives. He then ties it in with relevant Scripture passages. It's a very engaging read, and you won't be disappointed with it.<br />The big lesson I got from it is that loving God is not just something that we say with our lips. But it's something that we demonstrate with what we do with our time and with our lives. I was especially touched by the story of the woman who shows her love for God by donating her lunch hour every day to leading a prayer and Bible study time at a nearby prison. She has six kids at home. But she felt compelled to do something extra for Jesus each day. <br />The book is full of examples like this, and it turned out to be very satisfying.	2002-10-01

Yet it makes for fascinating reading, and Father Brown leaves few stones unturned in his penetrating look at the final hours of Jesus' earthly ministry. In volume one, he discusses the relationships between the first three gospels and the gospel of John, and then he proceesed on to a discussion of each gospel's passion narrative. Father Brown's main agenda is to get at the meaning of the biblical text as it stands. This is not to say that Brown shys away from discussing the historicity of a particular passage. Sometimes, he swims against the stream by leaving open the possibility of the historicity of a story (eg. that there really was a Jewish and a Roman trial of Jesus). And occasionally, he sees the passion stories as powerful metaphors rather than something that actually happened (cf John 18, when the crowd falls to the ground when Jesus says 'I am He.\\") Yet He is also rightfully skeptical about modern attempts to reconstruct what actually happened 1970 years ago. He prefers to let the text of scripture speak for itself.<br />This book is a huge, academic tome, and as rich and informative as it is, the reader better be prepared to make heavy weather of it. You could spend lots of extra time mining extra information out of all the footnotes and bibliographical references that Brown cites. But I could hardly recommend any other source for people who want to know more about the passion of Christ.	2002-02-21

Which foods will promote intestinal healing? Are there any supplements or vitamins that I should be taking?&quot; Dr Scala answers these questions and more. He says that many doctors dispense pills to get you through the current &quot;flare-up,&quot; but are not personally well informed on good nutrition, fitness, and preventative care. He even says that many medical schools simply do not teach about diet, nutrition and fitness. <br />While he resists the notion that good eating habits and nutrition alone will cure Colitis and Crohn's disease (he reminds readers that these diseases are chronic illnesses), he does suggest that 70% of the time, it can get you through a flare up without having to resort to taking steroids. That should perk up the ears of those who are sick and tired of all the nasty side effects associated with steroid use.<br />Dr. Scala strongly encourages the IBD patient to stay away from foods high in saturated fats and to eat lots of rice, potatoes, fish (for the omega 3 fatty acids that the IBD patient needs to promote healing in the colon), chicken, turkey, vegetables, and fruit without the skin on it. During the initial stages of a flareup, he recommends a liquid supplement to solid food, such as Encare.<br />The book is handy, helpful, and practical. I especially recommend it for the IBD patient, but it is also a good book for those who are simply interested in good nutrition.	2002-02-21

I've never read anything before that helped me understand the book of Revelation like this book does. Not only is it elegantly written in attention getting prose, but Craig Koester's interpretations are characterized by careful theological reflection. It is also happily free from many of the sensational and erroneous reflections that are heard coming from many of the apocalyptic television pulpits of America. I also like the way Koester understands the 7 cycles of visions in Revelation and how how one blends into the next one. He points out that every vision ends with a triumphant vision of Christ, which is something I hadn't quite noticed before, but won't soon forget.<br />A previous reviewer pointed out that this book has no study questions, and for this reason I would hesitate to use it as a textbook for a Sunday school class. This is the kind of book you would give to the well read member of your parish or your family. And if you happen to be in some kind of ministry, then this is would be one of the books I would want with me if I were preparing to teach a class on Revelation or if I was preparing a sermon.

And I am touched by the way the Lord has used this prayer in Wilkinson's own life. But I feel that the author has co-opted this prayer and has turned it into almost a formula for how to get God's blessing on your life, and I'm not sure that this is the way I take the prayer. The book is written almost like an infomercial: If you do 'this,' God will do 'this,' and you will experience 'this.'<br />The fact of the matter is that many people all over the world have prayed prayers much like the prayer of Jabez, and have not always had the same experience. Read any of Phil Yancey's books, and you'll see lots of examples of Christians who have experienced this kind of disappointment with God.<br />So read this book with caution and care.	2002-02-04

First of all, from reading it, it is easy to see that there are few things to do with the book of Revelation that Beale has not thought long and hard about. He is especially helpful at elucidating how much John utilizes Old Testament imagery in describing his revelatory visions. The commentary's introduction is 180 pages long and deals with the symbolism in the book of Revelation as well as the grammar and the theology and the political and cultural life setting.<br />But there are a number of points where the reader will definitely want to question some of Beale's conclusions. Not everyone will follow him in his interpretation of the word 'show' in Rev 1:1, or follow him in his idealistic amillennial understanding of Revelation. The reader may question Beale's reluctance to interpret literally at certain points in the commentary as well. But you can't possibly come away from a careful reading of this volume without learning something. For the educated clergyman, this is a great commentary to get, alongside the more accessible volumes of Craig Koester and Robert Mounce.	2002-02-01

He feels that the gospels are influenced to some degree by ancient Greco-Roman biographical style. He also sees Luke-Acts as an example of someone trying to write history, and he does a good job of explaining that Luke, like Thucydides and other ancient historians, used speeches to advance the story. He notes that while Luke didn't reproduce the speeches word for word, he did hit highlights and may have even have put some sections in his own words, which was an accepted way to record speeches at that time.<br />He also discusses the literary format of ancient letters as they relate to the letters of the New Testament. But I wish he would have focused more on how unique the NT letters are and how Paul's letters were far more profound (and longer) than the average ancient letter.<br />He also discusses the book of Revelation, and how this letter reflects other Jewish apocalyptic writings, and yet differs from them in other ways. One may disagree with the number of late dates Aune assigns some of the NT documents (for example, assigning 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus to the year 125 AD, 60 years after Paul died). But the book is still a solid entry in the Library of Early of Christianity series. <br />I should add though, that this isn't the easiest book in the world to read, certainly not as easy as Shaye Cohen's contribution to this serie. It is definitely geared more for the seminarian or the educated laymen.	2002-01-31

He discusses the sects of Judaism that existed during this time, beginning with the Maccabean revolt, and working through the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Essenes, the Christian movement, and Jewish people scattered throughout the Mediterranean world. He shows how Judaism was always a religion that emphasized practice and tradition over doctrine, while not denying that Judaism had a theology. Sometimes, the reader will want to argue strenuously with Cohen's conclusions, such as his contention that circumcision did not play an important role in the Torah, or that Job, Daniel, Esther, and many of the Psalms were written just a couple of hundred years before the common era. One may also question his conclusion that the dialogues betwen Jesus and the Pharisees reflected more of a post 70AD situation than something that really happened in the life of Jesus.<br />Despite these and other contentious points, the book is well written, engaging, and refreshing in the sense that you get to look at these years of Jewish history from a Jewish perspective.	2002-01-19

FF Bruce does a great job of explaining how the books of the Bible were canonized. I was surprised to learn how many people had different opinions on which books should be canonized. Many people had mized feelings about the book of Revelation because of it being a difficult book to understand. Others felt that James should not be included because it only mentions the name of Jesus twice. Similarly, the books of esther and Song of Songs in the Old Testament barely made it in.<br />And right up to the present day, there are those who feel that the Apocrypha should be included in the canon of Scripture, and the Roman Catholic church regards them as such today.<br />Bruce takes the time to discuss individual theologians such as Jerome, Origen, Tertullian, Augustine, Clement of Alexandria, Irenaeus, Athanasius, and many others and whenever possible, he furnishes their choices for books whoch were deemed fit for the canon of Scripture. Apparently, Athansius' trip to Rome in 350 AD was decisive for helping the western church decide on the 27 books of the New Testament that we now have today. Before this, they were hedging on Hebrews, 1 Peter, 2 Peter, Revelation, James and 2 and 3 John.<br />The book concludes with a couple of the author's lectures on the subect of the secret gospel of Mark (which he rejects) and the difference between the plenary meaning of scripture and the meaning in context.	2002-01-06

And the first 35 pages of the book constitutes some of the most turgid and boring prose I have ever read. But once the story enters the last two millenia of the BC era, the book picks up steam rapidly. It becomes a very engaging whirlwind trip through the Old Testament, with Kaiser stopping along the way to make some salient points anbout the historicity of particular passages. He discusses the date of the Exodus,, the historicity of the conquest of Israel, David's kingdom, and Josiah's discovery of the Book of the Law in the Temple. He also defends the early date for the book of Deuteronomy.<br />Kaiser is definitely swimming upstream in this book, as he is constantly dialoging with scholars who take less conservative positions on these matters, and he is virtually alone in the early dating of the Exodus. But he does an admirable job, and if you can make it past page 35, the book becomes very rich indeed.	2001-12-20

The author does a great job at drawing the reader into the lives of history's greatest preachers. And although the previous reviewer is right to say that Billy Graham was omitted, it was because the author made the conscious choice to focus only on those ministers who are no longer with us. He made a conscious choice not to evaluate ongoing ministries. This may be a source of frustration for some, but the main idea of the book is to learn from the ministries of the past. I do hope that the book is updated for each generation and that in the future, we will see preachers such as Billy Graham, E.V Hill, the Bishop TD Jakes, Joyce Meyer, and others.	2001-12-20

Screwtape is a demon leader for the devil, and each chapter is a letter from him to his nephew Wormwood, another demon in Satan's horde. Screwtape gives Wormwood lots of advice on how he can turn his 'patient,' a new Christian convert, away from the Christian faith. And the suggestions that Screwtape makes are not only wickedly ingenious, but it makes you shudder when you think about how this pans out in the real world.<br />But for me, the real highlights of the book are when Wormwood screws up and Screwtape, almost beside himself, takes him to task in moments of great humor. I have never read a writer in the 20th century who was ever the wordsmith as Lewis was, and this book is the peak of the mountain. A must read and a must buy.	2001-12-20

Some of the essays are very brief in nature, while others are pages long. Still, it is an excellent starting point, and for most people who just want the basic facts, it is all the information a person could want on the religious movements in the country. And one of the other things I like about the book is that as far as it it is possible, the authors take a very objective position.

A Carson's books, and this new sixth edition of his New Testament Commentary and Reference Survey is a welcome update to a classic.<br /><br />Carson makes some salient comments about the most high profile commentaries (and occasionally, the NOT so high profile commentaries). His remarks are salty and provocative, he is very complimentary of the ones he thinks are particularly outstanding (Douglas Moo on Romans, Anthony Thiselton on 1 Corinthians, Craig Keener on John, Darrell Bock's two volumes on Luke), and very hard on commentaries that he thinks you should avoid.<br /><br />Once in a while, Carson seems to contradict himself. For example, he says that the New International Version Application Commentary series is fairly lightweight and is an example of a shallow handling of the word of God (he later acknowledges that the series can be a useful pump primer in the move from text to application), and yet he has high praise for a number of its individual volumes (Scott Hafemann on 2 Corinthians, Craig Keener on Revelation, Douglas Moo on 2 Peter, Jude, Darrell Bock on Luke, David Garland on Colossians), and for some reason, he completely overlooks the not too shallow 1000 page contribution on Matthew by Michael Wilkins.<br /><br />I also wish that Carson had made mention of Ben Witherington's new commentary on Matthew in the Smith and Helwys series (perhaps Carson did not see it in time, as was the case for missing Andrew Lincoln on John).<br /><br />Also, I think Carson overrates Keener's work on John a bit; to me, Keener's work on John shares the same weaknesses with his counterpart volume on Matthew; heavy on history and background, lighter on theology and exegesis.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is the most exciting and zesty survey of NT commentaries money can buy, and Carson's portrayal of these commentaries is spot on the great majority of the time.<br /><br />One more thing: I feel bad for David DeSilva, who wrote a ringing endorsement of Carson's book on the back cover, and yet some of his books are shredded by Carson.<br /><br />I hope I stimulated your interest in this little volume, it makes for entertaining reading and is well worth the purchase.ment of Carson's book on the back cover, and yet some of his books are shredded by Carson.<br /><br />I hope I stimulated your interest in this little volume, it makes for entertaining reading and is well worth the purchase.	2001-11-08

You may find the information you're looking for, but you have to wade through an enormous amount of theological verbiage just to find the one statement or thought that could help you to understand a verse.<br />This commentary (and the other volumes in this series, for that matter) is refreshingly different. R. Kent Hughes has a wonderful ability of teaching the Bible in a practical way that in no way waters down the passage, and this comes through in nearly every page of this book. Whether you're a pastor looking for sermon help, or you're a Bible study leader looking for fresh insights, or a Sunday school teaching looking for stimulating thoughts, this is the book (and series) for you. I have heard it said that R. Kent Hughes' commentaries on the books of the Bible is to the modern day church what Matthew Henry and Barclay's commentaries were to previous generations, and I agree.

He says that you have to preach sermons using conversational English. He doesn't recommend using words that you wouldn't ordinarily use in a face to face discussion with a friend. He also recommends developing administrative skills, noting that many pastors dislike this part of the job. He also talks about the privilege of watching kids grow up, seeing them come to Christ and then performing their marriages and then experiencing the joy of bringing their children to Christ. He also points out that there will be times of stress and crisis in a long term pastorate.<br />This is a book that a person could sit down and read in about 4 or 5 hours, and whether you are a minister or whether you are a leader in a church, it is an interesting book.	2001-08-06

The main secret to keeping people in your church is to assimilate them into the Sunday School program. The author spares no words to describe the importance of having an evangelistic Sunday School program. He points out that churches have often seen Sunday school as a discipleship or educational program, but that we need to learn from these SBC churches that long term health and growth are best secured by giving the Sunday school department a revamped, evangelistic thrust. The survey results also suggest that if you communicate that Sunday school attendance is expected of all new members, then you will have a greater chance of keeping them active once they are assimilated into a class.<br />But it should be kept in mind that every church culture is different. Pastoring a church where Sunday school is an available option is nice. But to make it an expectation of all members can risk the ire of some of the long standing members of the congregation. In short, some of the suggestions the author makes will be easier to assimilate into your church than others. You have to know your people and have a sense of what the Holy Spirit is saying, and a sense of what will and will not fly in your parish.	2001-08-06

Ben believes that too much has been made over the differences between the Paul of Acts and the Paul of the undisputed letters and the pastoral epistles. He sets out to discuss the many hats that Paul wears and the roles that Paul takes on in his ministry. He discusses Paul the Jew, Paul the Roman citizen, Paul the Christian, Paul the apostle, Paul the orator, Paul the rhetorician, (you get the idea). And Ben does a good job of locating Paul in the honor/shame culture of the Greco-Roman world. He works hard to portray Paul as a highly educated man who both impacted and was impacted by the world in which he lived.    Ben also explains that Paul's theology and ethics and world view were shaped by the Christ event. This is a beautifully written and sane portrait of one of the most celebrated and denigrated religious figures in history. Thumbs way up!    Rev.

This was a great survey of the histories of the German reformed Church in America and of the Evangelical Synod both prior to and after the merger of the two churches in 1934. Being a Wisconsin pastor of a former E + R church, I thoroughly enjoyed reading about the German settlements in this area and how Mission House Seminary was established by the Reformed Church to train pastors for this area. I also loved reading about the founding of the Neilsville Indian school, and the starting up of what would later become the Eden Theological Seminary.<br />Yet the book was also haunting because much of the history was first written in the wake of the assimilation of the E + R church into what is now known as the United Church of Christ. In the book itself, you can feel the optimism the leaders of the E+ R church had about the union with the more liberal Congregational Christian churches. Now I wonder how many of them who are still alive secretly wish that the union had never happened. Since that time, the churches have been plagued with liberal Protestant pastors who have lacked the commitment to the infallibility and authority of scripture that prior generations of Reformed pastors always held fast to. This rejection of scriptural authority has led to a theological and moral malaise within the UCC that has led to the present day apostasy now apparent in the mainline denominations nationwide; including support for unbiblical concepts such as abortion on demand, homosexual relationships, religious pluralism, the use of mission monies for left wing political causes rather than for the propagating of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and unholy alliances with other religions which call into question the supremacy and absolute lordship of Jesus Christ over the nations.	2001-07-25

What I like about this volume is that it captures some of the tension and excitement of the first 50 years of the Protestant Reformation. And the author has made a convincing argument that this era could be better described as an era of theological reformations rather than just one reformation per se. And I found it fascinating how bitterly divided many of the Reformers were with one another and with how each individual country experienced theological reformation in different ways. I had great admiration for the convictions of Martin Luther at the same time as I had deep misgivings over his tendency toward divisiveness. I had great respect for the mind of Calvin and the tenacity of William Tyndale and the godliness and perseverance of Michale Sattler.<br />Another thing that astonished me as I read through this volume was how many reformers died early on in the reformation and at such a young age. reading about how many reformers were tortured or burned at the stake made my heart heavy with regret. A very thought provoking survey of a tumultuous period of history.	2000-12-27
US	52766649	R195EKK7GX0HQ3	0829809910	584810318	My Confirmation: A Guide for Confirmation Instruction	Books	3	6	18	N	N	A clearly written UCC confirmation textbook	The thing that I like about this book is that it is clearly written for confirmation students at the 7th and 8th grade level. I also like the clear  chapter divisions and the questions for students at the end of each  chapter.    But the things that concern me about the book are some of the  theological positions. For example, in the chapter on the Bible, we're told  that the Bible contains the word of God. But saying that the Bible contains  the word of God is a lot different from saying that the Bible IS the word  of God. Moreover, the door is left wide open for the reader to decide for  him or herself which parts of the Bible constitute the word of  God.    Another concern that I had was the chapter about Jesus Christ. It  never mentions that Christ shed his blood on the cross for our sins and  that Christ is the only way to God. The emphasis is heavier on Jesus as a  moral example than on Jesus as our only hope for salvation.     I did find  the chapter on foreign missions very helpful. It lists 7 things that UCC  foreign missionaries do around the world. Unfortunately, none of the seven  mentioned bringing the gospel of Christ to lost people.     The chapters  dealing with the history of the United Church of Christ and the work of the  United Church of Christ were more helpful for me. I was able to use this  material and teach our confirmands a lot about our heritage.    I have to  admit that this is the best UCC confirmation material currently available.  But because of its theological errors, I would recommend either using the  work with wisdom and caution. Or you could do what I did and write your own  curriculum, using some of the more helpful material from this book as a  guide.	2000-08-19

But his comments on the text are timeless and very practical. He  has a wonderful gift of being able to glean the messages and the points in  each scripture. And he is a master at applying the scriptures to  comtemporary life. <br />Having said that, like all other expositions of holy  writ, you need to use Ryle's work judiciously. Every once in a while, he  brings out points in a passage that may not be salient for the needs of  your sermon. And he sometimes divides passages into smaller sections when  you may choose to preach the larger section. But these are minor points. I  can think of a number of times when my brain was fried and Ryle provoked my  thinking and gave me some seminal expository thoughts. And that's exactly  what the preacher needs.	2000-08-19

And thank God for the internet, because...I can tune in to him anytime I want.    This 5 volume commentary set digests some of his most helpful comments from his 5 year trip through the Bible. And in some passages, he is a wonderful help. And in other passages, he hardly says a word! So what this means for the preacher is that some Sundays, McGee will help you a lot, and on other Sundays, he won't help you at all. But the times he is helpful outweigh the times when he isn't, so I would still heartily recommend this set to your pastor.	2000-08-19

This is a rich exposition of John's gospel, interpreting the text in its immediate context and in its canonical context. It also draws applications for today. Having said that, &quot;today&quot; is a relative term: Pink  applies it to situations that were true of the evangelical church in the  mid 1940's. But there is so much timeless material here, that the  commentary is really a must for the pastor's bookshelf. In particular, the  comments on John 1 and John 3 and John 9 are flat out brilliant. Yet I must  also  concur with the previous reviewer who noted that occasionally, Pink  spiritualizes the text a bit too often. Particularly with numbers, but also  with his interpretation of John chapter two, which he sees as an symbolic  reference to Judaism as a &quot;dead husk.&quot; In his attempt to draw  applications for today, he sometimes reads things into the text that aren't  there (notice some of his comments on John 7-8). But for the most part,  this is a tremendously rich treatment of the Gospel of John.	2000-08-02

He  comes out evangelical in his teachings on the primacy of scripture (yet  reflecting his Barthian influences, he sees scripture as a medium of divine  revelation rather than just flat out divine revelation), salvation by grace  through faith, and the substitutionary atonement of Christ (a doctrine that  is sometimes ridiculed as archaic and primitive in the liberal Protestant  tradition).<br />In volume two, Bloesch contributes fascinating chapters on  the cruciality of preaching (a much ignored subject in most systematic  theologies), scriptural holiness (where Bloesch is influenced somewhat by  the Wesleyan-Holiness tradition), and the personal return of Jesus Christ  (where Bloesch comes out with an awkward position combining elements of  amillennial and postmillenial thought). He also concludes the book with an  insightful discussion on heaven and hell, and a closing chapter on the  future of evangelicalism. I recommend these volumes highly, but especially  to those who are in mainline denominations such as the United Church of  Christ and the Presbyterian Church, USA.	2000-08-02

It is a powerful, biblically centered book, and it will get you excited about the future of the church in America.<br /><br />Yet I  want to caution the reader about three things: Number one: The book gives a  very detailed and organized plan for growing healthy churches, and if you  neglect even one bit of instruction, your plans could go awry. The close  attention to detail sometimes made me feel a bit overwhelmed. Number two:  This paradigm is most effective for planting new congregations. I have  discovered that the book's principles are very difficult to implement in a congregation that is over 100 years old. Not impossible. Just difficult.  For those of you who are serving in older congregations with an average  attendance of 100 or higher, I would also want to refer you to literature  such as \\"Help for the Small Church Pastor\\" by Steve Bierly...which deals with renewing smaller, existing churches with an  extensive history. And a third thing to keep in mind is that what worked  for Rick Warren in the laid back culture of southern California may not  necessarily work in the breadbasket of America.<br /><br />Another caution that I would want to mention is that Rick is not always careful with the text of scripture. For example, he argues that we should tell more stories in our sermons to make the truth plainer. He supports this by referring to Matthew 13:34 where it says that Jesus taught in parables. But what Rick overlooks is that Jesus taught in parables so that \\"you would be ever hearing, but never perceiving.\\" He spoke in parables so that only the wise in heart would comprehend, which is the exact opposite of what Warren says! There are enough misuses and misapprehensions of scripture in PDC to fill a small book.<br /><br />In spite of these shortcomings, the book talks a lot of good sense. mMy advice would be to  read the book once to get a feel for the Purpose Driven Church paradigm.  Then read it a second time with your particular church home in mind to draw  out some principles and to brainstorm ideas.y advice would be to  read the book once to get a feel for the Purpose Driven Church paradigm.

The chapters are only 5 or 6 pages long, and they are saturated with Scripture references, which saves the  Bible study leader lots of time in preparation. But the busy beaver who  spends the time to look up the scripture references will be richly rewarded  by what he discovers. The chapters on the Bible and the ones on God the  Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are well written and say much  about the character of God. But the chapters that deal with end times  events are not quite as strong, mainly because of the false assumption of  the authors that anyone who doesn't agree is simply guilty of not  interpreting the scriptures literally. But other than that minor quibble, I  love the book. After all these years, this is still of the best books to  use to introduce people to the major themes of the Bible. I recommend it  highly. But make sure you also buy &quot;The Rapture Question  Answered&quot; by Robert Van Kampen to balance out the errors in end times  thinking.	2000-01-10

He loved Jesus more than anything else in the world, and it comes through in this biography written by his widow Melody Green.    You will read of Keith's early interest in spiritual things, his life in the 70's hippie sub-culture, his shattering conversion to Christ in response to the Spirit-filled preaching of Kenn Gullickson, (and his wife's conversion the following week), and his excitement at coming to know Jesus.    You also read of his zeal in winning people to the Lord, and how over the course of months, he felt the leading of the Lord to make Christian music albums. You read of his love for the writings of the Rev. Charles Finney, and his desire to see people totally broken and spilled out before the Lord in repentance and faith.    You read of his later interest in world missions, and his tragic death in a plane crash (along with his son Josiah and daughter Bethany and others who were on board).    Melody then has a brief appendix illustrating how keiths music stills fans into flame the fire of faith in the lives of so many. I am one of those people, and I highly recommend this stirring biography.	1999-11-30

He even says that we have every  reason to be hopeful that the rich young man got saved!<br /><br />Not only that,  despite what the two endorsements by Rodriguez and Rademacher say, this  book is quite combative against MacArthur in the end notes. The bottom line  is that this presentation of the gospel is a false gospel.<br /><br />2009 update - ten years later - I'm sorry to hear of Dr. Hodges' passing. And I do agree with those who say that John Gerstner's book was bad, and that Macarthur is too far on the Reformed side. Craig Blomberg is the co-author of a new book on classic premillennialism that should be interesting, as he takes on some aspects of dispensational pre-mill thinking.<br /><br />Yet as extreme to the Reformed right as Macarthur is on this issue, I think Zane was too far to the left. There ought not to be such a hard line between believing and repentance, conversion and surrender. The way I see it, each gospel writer emphasized different aspects of the gospel. Luke talks about repentance in the context of the gospel more than anyone - see especially Luke 24:47. It is not tenable to relegate repentance as a mandate for the church and not for the unsaved.<br /><br />And yet in Hodges defense, John greatly emphasizes the belief side of the gospel message with nary a word about repentance. Having said that, the concept of repentance may be alluded to in John 5:13-14 and certainly in John 8:11, though this true event in the life of Jesus probably did not originate as a part of John's gospel.<br /><br />Moreover, Matthew and Mark seem to teach a nice hybrid between repentance and belief - see Mark 1:14-15 for example.<br /><br />Moreover, it will not suffice to suggest with Ryrie that repentance is a change of mind about Christ. That is a part of it. But it is also a change of mind about the direction of our lives, a change of mind about our sin. The other Greek word for repentance literally means \\"to turn around.\\"<br /><br />I remain perplexed by Hodges' reading of the rich young ruler story (although MacArthur's is also open to criticism).about the direction of our lives, a change of mind about our sin.

Because even though Rosenthal is right to say  that Christ will return after the opening of the sixth seal and with the  opening of the 7th seal, Gundry may be right to say that the seventh seal  converges in time with the seventh trumpet and the seventh bowl. And that  makes prewrath rapturism a slightly modified posttribulationism.

He concludes by presenting 50 arguments for pretribulationism, which he himself admits is formidable primarily because of the sheer number of arguments and not due to any one powerful argument. At any rate, the overall case Walvoord makes for the pretribulational rapture is persuasive. If you are still trying to make up your mind, I'd make this the first book about the rapture I would read.	1999-11-06

Gregg's book is amazingly objective. I figured his bias would show up sooner or later. But he does a good job at presenting four different approaches to the book of Revelation. His suggestions for how to read the  book were also quite helpful.	1999-11-05

Witherington discusses the words of Jesus, the deeds of Jesus, and the relationships of Jesus as described in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. He ably defends their historicity and authenticity. He contends that Jesus had a messianic, transcendent self understanding and that he saw himself as more than just an ordinary human being, but as the divine agent of God bringing in the kingdom. A classic defense.	1999-11-05

I'm disappointed that there aren't more books on the posttribulational position out there. But Gundry does a good job at  critiquing the popular pretribulational view and setting forth a solid  exegetical defense of posttribulationism. His interpretation of John 14 is  a little wrong. But other than that, it's really good.	1999-11-05

The first part of the book is a defense of the grammatical-historical interpretation of Bible prophecy. Then Pentecost dives right in with a survey of the four major biblical covenants, and a study of Israel in prophecy, the Gentiles in prophecy, and the church in prophecy. He includes a detailed discussion of the timing of the rapture, the events of the seven year tribulation period, and the second coming of Christ, followed by the 1000 year Millennial reign of Christ. He then has a helpful section about the eternal state.    It must be stated that this is a 600 page heavy duty textbook. It is not like reading a Frank Peretti novel or a Left Behind book. This is for the hard core Bible prophecy student, and it is still THE end times book to get. Pray that someone will wake up and revise it for the 21st century and include chapters critiquing the prewrath rapture view and the preterist view.	1999-11-05

I love it. It was my favorite commentary on Luke for a long time. But it is long on exegesis and theology and short on practical stuff. And  it doesn't have much of an introduction at all! Marshall's &quot;Luke:  Historian and Theologian should be purchased with this to compensate for a  lack of an introduction. But the great thing about this commentary is how  accurate Marshall is on his interpretations of the passages.	1999-11-03

Darrell Bock stays close to the text, and he engages in dialogue many of the great scholars of the present and of the past. I also appreciate his eye for how the text applies to our lives today. While he discusses controversial sections of Luke, he lists all of the main interpretations that have been offered on a point, and when he is through, he explains why he has chosen one of those interpretations.    One noteworthy point is that this two volume set came out right when the left wing Jesus Seminar was coming into its own as a study group, and Bock consistently defends the historicity of the text in response to statements the Seminar has made. This may make his two volume exposition of Luke something of a period piece.    But coming from a pastor who has all the major studies on Luke, this commentary rocks. This one is the best.    One more point: The print is really large for an academic book  like this, too. It is easy on the eyes.	1999-11-03

He has a lot of information about table fellowship in the Greco-Roman world. He is also concerned with the universal scope of the gospel in Luke, noting the author's interest in women disciples and in the vindication of the poor (Luke 6:22ff, Luke 16:19-31).    My main concern with this commentary is that there is too heavy of an emphasis on the cultural background of the text and not always enough emphasis on the exposition of the text. Those looking for more theological reflection may want to consult Joel Green's outstanding book \\"The Theology of the Gospel of Luke,\\" a book that was so sound that I had to give it 5 stars.    This commentary on Luke is helpful for those looking for more socio-historical data, but I would not recommend using it as your main commentary. Pride of place for commentaries on Luke must go to the two volume set by Darrell Bock.	1999-11-03

This two volume set on Luke's Gospel provides a wealth of information. Fitzmyer leaves very few stones unturned in this lengthy commentary. The introduction is lengthy and intorduces the student to the various themes found in the Gospel.    I should say by way of friendly criticism that Fitzmyer is skeptical about the likelihood that some of the stories in this Gospel go back to a situation in the life of the historical Jesus. For example, he believes that Luke is historically inaccurate in some of the things he records in the Christmas story (Luke 2), and although he is stirred by the power of Jesus' extension of forgiveness to the sinful woman of Luke 7:36-50, he states that it is unlikely that this event happened the way it is described.    Nevertheless, if you can get past the occasional bits of historical pessimism, there is much to be garnered by reading this academic work. I should also say that since this set is more than 20 years old, its scholarship is beginning to look dated. Moreover, the two volume work by Darrell Bock is generally more accurate in its exegesis and more helpful to the preacher looking for sermonic material.    The long and short of all this is that this is no longer a first or second choice for Luke commentaries. I would purchase Darrell Bock's two volume set, and perhaps the paperback Life Application commentary on this Gospel.	1999-11-03

But he allegorizes much of the book into a Christians versus evil motif. He also spiritualizes the millennium so that it is not a literal 1000 reign of Christ with His saints.  <br /> <br />Yet these are minor areas where faithful believers in Christ have differed through the years. Generally speaking, this is a very reliable resource for studying the theology of Revelation. Read it alongside Craig Koester's terrif Revelation and the End of All Things and Robert Mounce's solid commentary.	1999-11-03

But Nolland has many good insights, and despite the all too brief introduction, it is a valuable addition to your library if you're studying  the Gospel of Luke. My only other complaint is that the Explanation section  merely repeats key sentences in the commentary section without giving any  further practical wisdom.	1999-11-03

The section on hermeneutics was well done. I noticed that Ryrie alternates between calling his critics \\"non-dispensationalists\\" and  \\"anti-dispensationalists\\", and it would have helped to just stick with one expression. Not only that, the term  \\"antidispensationalist\\" is a little too vitriolic for me. I also thought that there was a little too much emotional subjectivity, especially  in Ryrie's addendum on the Sermon on the Mount and in other places where he rebutts the rebuttals of others.	1999-11-03
