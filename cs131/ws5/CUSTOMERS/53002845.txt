I started life reading all of the works of William Faulkner -- The best American writer of the 20th Century.  Richard Powers is obviously a genius and a great writer.  Don Dillio, John Irving, and especially Wallace Stegner are all great writers. But Mark Helprin is a true genius with language. After reading four of Mark Helprin's books, he comes closest to the magic writing of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, except I end up caring a gread deal more about his characters.  &quot;Winter's Tale&quot; is remarkable.  Just the language in &quot;A Soldier of the Great War&quot;; and &quot;Memoir from Antproof Case&quot; are worth reading.  The brillance of the later works are evident in &quot;Refiner's Fire&quot;.	2001-10-17

Mark Helprin's &quot;Winter's Tale&quot; was best novel I have read in the past 25 years. &quot;A Soldier of the Great War&quot; was also one of the best written novels I have read. &quot;Memoir From Antproof Case&quot; is right behind &quot;Winter's Tale&quot; in sheer writing virtueosity. Helprin can use words, images, thoughts, stories in a beautiful web. William Faulkner is greatest novelist in last 100 years, and Mark Helprin is greatest living novelist.	2001-08-31

However, every once in a while a work of art is created in a mystery format.  A Small Death in Lisbon is a wonderful treat.

More entertaining are the personalities of the local sheriff, Nick Morrelli, and the FBI agent, Maggie O'Dell.

The protagonist is escaping an inescable experience after high school graduation in the United  States.  We see the beauty and etheral nature of Paris through her artistic  eyes.  We learn to live and love through her.  I define a tour-de-force as  a book that grabs hold of you with its language, its characters, its  depiction of environment as an extention of the characters and plot.  It  describes a reader's ultimate joy: picking up reading a book and being  &quot;totally&quot; transported into another, more powerful and meaningful  reality.  If Lily King never writes another book, it doesn't matter.  This  is a classic.  It is a self-contained work of art/pleasure.  Bravo.	2000-05-31

He is aware that the Achilles Heel of our current Military capability is joint Service rivalry.  Each Service will go its own way until it is too late or until  the American people start paying attention.  Adm. Owens explains the  problem simply and eloquently.  It is more about military culture than  money.  Since the money just isn't there, he explains how and why the  culture must change. Unfortunately, this may mean the end of the Army Navy  football game.  If the two Services are taught to hate one another at the  collge leve, why would they start cooperating when they become Admirals and  Generals.  According to Adm. Owens the U.S. has the technology to continue  to be a great military power but the Services will have to stop trying to  &quot;outplay&quot; their Service counter parts in real  &quot;wars&quot;.<br />This book provides great insight as to why it is so  difficult to implement a Revolution in Military Affairs.	2000-05-22

I read it with amazement that someone can write like this.  It will be the book to read in 2097 to discover what the heck was going on it the second half of the 20th century.  Delillo has not only figured it out but shows us how he broke the code.  This is the kind of book that, if someone else is in the room with you, you want to read them paragraphs out loud and say &quot;isn't that amazing writing?.  Cold Mountain was Great, but that was Mozart, this is Beethoven, Bach and Brahms.	1997-11-20

William Faulkner could slowly draw you in, wring you out, and you felt good to be alive after you finished reading.  Frazier's two characters will be an indelible part of my consciousness, just as I remember Quentin Compton, whom I still think of fondly 25 years after first reading The Sound and the Fury.	1997-10-10

Having really enjoyed &quot;Players&quot; by Clay Reynolds, I thought I would give &quot;Rage&quot; a try.  I'm glad I did.  You can see that &quot;Players&quot; didn't just happen.  Reynolds has been working at his craft for several years now, as evidenced by the great writing in &quot;Rage&quot;.  The humor in Reynolds' books is hysterical	1997-09-21

Players is a plain old great read	1997-08-12

This book got a great review, and every book I've ordered from amazon.com has been a 9 0r 10.  But this one just lost my interest after a hundred pages.  I either get a buzz from a book or I don't.

Obviously I've been missing something.  I couldn't believe Crumley could keep up the pace, but he does.  What imaginative characters, what a plot, what a masterful effort!  Television and movies can't keep you any more absorbed than this novel	1997-07-18

This is the first Easy Rawlins mystery for me. It took a few pages, but I quickly got caught up in being very interested in the unique characteristics that make up Easy Rawlins.  The plot was very well crafted and I can now understand what the &quot;buzz&quot; has been all about for Walter Mosley.  I look forward to reading more of the Easy Rawlins mysteries	1997-07-12
US	53002845	R1MXNPJQTUL5K5	0312143141	497375829	Dog Eat Dog	Books	5	3	4	N	Y	A one-of-a-kind literary tour-de-force.	My all time favorite writer is William Faulkner. Very simply he had a way with words.  Currently, only William Styron comes close.  Sophie's Choice embeds itself on your psyche the same way The Sound and the Fury throws your emotions spinning down a steep hill.  William Styron tells us that Edward Bunker, an ex-con, is the only one who can really make us understand what an ex-con experiences.  Bunker does more than that.  His &quot;way with words&quot; is remarkable.  In five or ten years grad students will be attempting to explain the subtleties of Dog Eat Dog.  For now, its a great read and a great story.  Like any great fiction, be ready for the roller coaster ride	1997-07-02

Mark Sullivan captures nature, and the native Indian's view of nature, in a way that, for the first time, gave me a real feel for their view of spiritual nature.  A book is really good when I actually look forward to coming home from work and reading it for about an hour or two.  It is a great pleasure.  This book fit that category	1997-06-17
