The mystery of whether Ethan is or is not a vampire at the beginning of the book makes it intriguing.  What really makes the novel interesting is that it is hard to tell who Ethan really is, how old Ethan really is, and whether or not he is on Kerry's side, or if she might become a vampire, or half-vampire by the end of the book. <br /> <br />Vivian Vande Velde does a good job keeping the book interesting from start to finish.  There are always questions of \\"what if\\" all the way through the novel.  I always like the different ways authors of these books decide to state what is \\"real\\" and fake for vampires and their kind.  Vande Velde does this too and it makes you think for the briefest moment that maybe these vampires are for real.   <br /> <br />The suspense is good up until the end.  Kerry's dreamlike state and curiosity and passsion toward the vampire race makes the end worthwhile.  I enjoyed this novel and look to read the other works of Vivian Vande Velde.  Good book!	2005-09-19

I began this book thinking Crutcher had finally lost it, writing about a dead person who hangs around to help out his grieving friend, but then Crutcher threw a curve and I discovered the book is about censorship.   <br /> <br />Chris Crutcher is a hero to adults who believe that the only way to edify our childeren is allow them to be free-thinking beings who can make their own determination of what is \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" in literature or in life.  The important thing is that our kids read, and if that means they have to read books like Crutcher's where if you count bad words and taboo plot topics, you will be worn out after the first chapter, then, so be it.   <br /> <br />Crutcher makes lots of good points in this novel, and I will respect the review readers out there enough to let you read the book to see what I mean.   <br /> <br />My only disappointment is that Crutcher didn't give me some publicity on page 226 when listing authors who were banned from a library in the novel.  No respect.  Story of my life. <br /> <br />I recommend this book for teens who have been a part of some of the censorship battles that have been going on all over our nation, especially the last 4-5 years.  I also recommend this book to teens who have no adult in their life who gives them the respect that a young adult deserves.  <br /> <br />I recommend this book for adults who fight for the rights of our teens to read what they like to read. <br />   <br />DISCLAIMER: <br />This book is not for everyone.  There is no profanity in this book.  There are, however, subtle plot references from the fictional fictional book Warren Peece that mention taboo issues which are not appropriate in the minds of those who believe solving problems can only be done by telling our youth what is righteous and moral, and never discussing any other viewpoints, or never allowing our kids to take what they have been taught at home and in life, read the offending literature, and make their own determinations basedon their own rational, well thought out thoughts.	2005-06-16

The suspense is superb, and the book is fast-paced.  I have no interest in wicca, but the suspense and mystery far outweighs the embedded wicca elements.  The main character, Stacey is easy to like and she brings the reader into the story.  From there, Laurie Faria Stolarz does the rest by creating an intriguing plot with just the right amount of surprises and twists. The new character, Jacob, adds just enough to make this novel just a little bit more intriguing than Blue is For Nightmares.   <br /> <br />If you like suspenseful novels, this book is very satisfying.   <br /> <br /> <br />Great book.  I am starting Silver is for Secrets today.	2005-02-08

I enjoyed reading about the school for musical geniuses, The Bloor Academy, and it is interesting that only a few of the students are \\"endowed\\" with some sort of magical powers--the rest of the students are just geniuses in the area of art or music.  <br /> <br />Charlie Bone's family is dysunctional, yet stuck on who deserves to be endowed and who does not.  They do not see their own faults, which always makes for an interesting situation. <br /> <br />Of course there are similarities to Harry Potter, but I was intrigued with this book for different reasons.  Harry Potter is similar to many books before it too, but Potter just happened to hit the popularity jackpot. <br /> <br />Midnight for Charlie Bone stands out on its own, and is a very worthy read.  Sometimes I think readers forget that we are all critics, but it is okay to enjoy what you are reading, even if it is a kids' book.  I don't think there is an age limit for good literature, and what makes a book good is the desire for a reader to want to finish what is being read because the book presents elements of intrigue that keep that book in your hands up until completion. <br /> <br />Charlie Bone has the potential to be a great series.  The first in the series is excellent and the background story of \\"The Children of The Red King\\" can add more surprises as the series continues.   <br /> <br />The coolest part is that all \\"endowed\\" children have powers, but they aren't taught spells and the like, they just have to discover what their powers are.  The vast array of already presented characters and their very different powers sets this book apart from the Potter series and in my next review I will not even mention Mr. Potter.  <br /> <br />This is a wonderful book.	2005-02-08

Bobby Pendragon begins to accept his role as a traveler and is forced to become a mentor as well.  The traveler role becomes clearer in this book, and Cloral is a very interesting world with all of its high-tech water-based technology.  MacHale keeps the series interesting by continuing to surpass his creativity with each new world that Bobby and the travelers encounter while trying to foil Saint Dane's plans to destroy Halla(The Universe). <br /> <br />I also liked the newer element of time travel that relates to a realm we all understand--Second Earth(Earth).   <br /> <br />This book is fast-paced and intriguing--those are the two elements I look for when reading a book.  The Pendragon series has satisfied those conditions thus far. <br /> <br />I hope the rest in the series are as good as the first two are.	2005-02-08

From the very beginning it is easy to find interest in young Bobby describing his cool uncle interrupting Bobby's first kiss. <br /> <br />That is where the normalcy in Bobby Pendragon's life ends.  From there MacHale does an excellent job of keeping the plot fresh, interesting and eventful.   <br /> <br />This book is right up there with Garth Nix's Mister Monday and it is as interesting a start to a series as Darren Shan's Cirque Du Freak.

As I finished the first thirty pages or so this book turned into something much better than a girl and her rich boyfriend.   <br /> <br />This story about getting to know each other is best done in the film, Coup Deville starring Daniel Stern and Patrick Dempsey.  Zig Zag easily rivals the aforementioned classic film with a very intriguing story about a girl who is left by her boyfriend to spend her last summer alone.  That girl, Robin, decides to go on a trip with her Aunt and cousins whose dad just recently died.  The whole family has post-traumatic issues and Robin ends up being like a therapist for her extended family's dysfunction. <br /> <br />Marshall, Iris and Dory all have their own individual issues that Robin helps them deal with and get their mind off of the best she can.

That story in itself is worth the read.  The vampire story that picks up toward the end is just gravy.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for anyone who likes light, quick reads.

Frank does a superb job of drawing the reader into the story, accurately and believably describing the gossip and rumor circles that can easily develop in this type of school setting, and showing how seemingly innocent rumors and drama can turn into very hurtful items. <br /> <br />All of the characters in this book learn a solid lesson about life and how important it is to say what you are feeling and speak the truth on behalf of those you care for, or lives can be drastically changed. <br /> <br />Friction is a story of life, love, learning, betrayal, repression, trust, friendship, honesty, lies, the importance of parents being there for their children and knowing when a child is crying for help.   <br /> <br />E.R. Frank knows kids very well.  She knows teens even better.  Most importantly, E.R. Frank has not lost touch with the younger generations. <br /> <br />E.R.

The book may be too real for some, but not if you are a realist.   <br /> <br />America's battle to understand who he is in this world is an exhiliratingly sad ride that alerts readers to a child welfare system that is overworked and understaffed.  America actually gets \\"lost\\" in the system, which is symbolic of the thousands of American children who are ignored and \\"lost\\" everyday in our country's protection services.   <br /> <br />America reminds us that our children need more than just parents to raise and watch out for them.  Our children need other adults, teachers, coaches, counselors, neighbors and general role models to look out for our youth and set a positive example for them. <br /> <br />All of those commercials that ask for communities to take a second to get to know their youth are not for those of us who already do that.  Even if you chose not to have kids, our country was not built on the attitude of \\"It's not my responsibility.\\" <br /> <br />I love America symbolically, literally and on so many levels I can't even put it into words.  <br /> <br />America is beautiful.  If this book doesn't touch your emotions, then you are not human.  This book is raw, real and heartbreakingly intriguing. <br /> <br />Thank you E.R.

Vince is in the precarious position of being the son of a mob boss who wants nothing to do with the \\"family business\\".  <br />The ways in which the \\"family business\\" keeps finding its way into Vince's life makes this book fun and unpredictable.<br />The strongest part of this novel is that Gordon Korman is able to take a very common plot line (The mob family) and make it into something very unique and interesting.  His modernization of Romeo and Juliet is the best such depiction in a very long time.<br />Once you have read the book, buy the audio book too.  Max Casella from Doogie Howser reads the book in his very appropriate New Jersey accent, and the entertainment level just rises.<br />What a great accomplishment by Gordon Korman!  This book should be used as a companion for Romeo and Juliet in classrooms all across the nation.  If not, Young Adults readers and reluctant readers can definitely get through this page-turning gem of a novel.	2003-10-30
