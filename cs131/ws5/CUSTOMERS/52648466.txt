For some time I have been one of those who, for some reason, believed that strength could only be built with barbells and dumbells in a nice, clean gym.  This peculiar way of thinking was due to being under the spell of body-bulding and the fashionable scene that goes along with it nowadays. <br /> <br />Sure barbells and dumbells need to be a big part of a strength trainers \\"arsenal\\" but, thanks to writers like Brooks Kubik (\\"Dinosaur Training\\"), Matt Furey, and the author of this book, Steve Justa I have come to see that odd-objects (sanbags, barrels, even the human body) can be used to build super strength.  These awkward shaped objects build muscles that remain unaffected by \\"normal\\" barbell training and, like some barbell exercises (squats, deadlifts, bench press), these types of lifts are compound exercises which emphasize that a great many muscles work together.  This breaks with the body-building paradigm which emphasizes isolation. <br /> <br />Justa underscores saftey and gives methods he uses to train safely. <br />He also emphasizes the importance of building up the tendons and ligaments, a point entirely missing in most recent literature (thugh it was important among old-time strength builders). <br /> <br />Furthermore, you will get caught up in Justa's enthusiam for the iron game and the resultant greater motivation you enjoy from reading this book will lead to bigger gains.  Good luck!	2005-05-07

But both camps have common ground in needing to learn propert technique.  This is the book, and it has something for everyone in detail.  If you are a body-builder there are plenty of isolation exercises described, even though the author emphasizes compound lifts.  If you are a powerlifter/strength trainer, it has very detailed descriptions and pictures on the squat, deadlift, bench press, overhead presses and even a fair amount on grip work.  <br /> <br />The author obviously wrote a book that he would have liked to have had when he began his training.  As McRobert explains in several places, he now has a bad back due to years of improper training.  He has written this book to help others avoid the same fate or, as in my case, to help us train despite of such drawbacks. <br /> <br />You cant train when you are injured, so get smart and learn proper technique.  You would do wise, toward that end, to study this book thoroughly.	2005-05-01

One might expect this message in a tract on sociology but, oddly enough, it is the core theory of Brook Kubik's weightlifting book, \\"Dinosaur Training\\".  Having read it, I feel like a veil of illusion has been lifted from my eyes.  The core theory is this: People in gyms, the so-called \\"bodybuilders\\", are building the apperance of strength, not strength itself.  In his book, Kubik urges us to break with that pattern and get back to building real strength in the fashion of \\"old time\\" weightlifters like Arthur Saxon.   The book is as much a manifesto as training manual. <br /> <br />Kubik regularly pokes fun of those who visit the gym for the EXCLUSIVE purpose of looking \\"buff, pumped, sculpted or toned\\". <br />In fact, his mockery is so humorous that I laughed out loud many times during my reading of \\"Dinosaur Training\\".  Thinking of the book yesterday while at the gym, I could not keep a straight face as I saw the buff \\"bikini boys\\" and \\"butt-thonged godesses\\"..you know, the typical denizens of the present-day gym world. <br />Social critique and humor aside, this book will get you wildly excited to start \\"STRENGTH\\" training.  Better not read it late at night, or you will be in your garage doing deadlifts at midnight!  Furthermore, it not only motivates you but gives you the knowledge that you need to build that strength: the lifts, the schedules, the routines.   <br /> <br />Kubik emphasizes that the equipment and routines that you need to build real strength are SIMPLE, as opposed to the worthless, complex bodybuilding systems that now blight the gyms of America. <br />The good news is that simple hardwork over a period of time with basic lifts -bench press, deadlifts, squat-performed with progressively heavy weights are all you need to build real strength.  Read this book.  The only reason you will want to put it down is to get started on your training! <br />	2005-04-25

At first view, this book appears to be about Mr. Fussel's adventure in bodybuilding...but it is much more.  The author originally takes up bodybuilding after a mugging incident, however, he quickly catches the iron-game bug, discovers that he is genetically gifted and goes on to compete.  He becomes one-minded about winning and goes to all the extremes, dietary and otherwise, to obtain his goal.   After having gone to such extremes and winning the competition, Fussel decides to give up.  He concludes that it was all youthful folly...probably an over-reaction to the mugging and his feelings of insecurity which still continued to exist despite the massive frame he built up. <br /> <br />In other words, bodybuilding is not IMPORTANT enough.  Well, how many times have each of us had our passions drowned by that sentiment.  The world, the heideggerian Das Mann, tells us that that which we like is not important.  We are plagued with self-doubts about the endeavor we take up and enjoy because it is not important in the eyes of our parents, friends or society at large.  So we end up taking up some line of work or pursuit that is important.  And as a result, end up leading dull, passionless lives.  One wonders what has become of Mr. Fussell, if his life is more filled with meaning and importance since leaving the world of bodybuilding. <br /> <br />Make no mistake bodybuilding like every field has its pathological side. What should be (and usually is) a very healthy <br />sport can get sidetracked by drug abuse and, of course, has a plethora of marketing montebanks promising quick fixes and delivering nothing.  Nonetheless, bodybuilding has many passionate followers and there is nothing wrong with that. <br /> <br />In this work, all bodybuilders live vicariously through the dreams and sweat of the author.  It even raises the philosophical question as to the importance of passion in our lives.  Unfortunately, Mr. Fussel's answer to this question is that it was all a fanatical psychological overcompensation.  I disagree with that, but the book is nonetheless spellbounding.  Five stars!	2005-04-16

Let me say that I have not read Brookfields other book \\"Mastery of Hand Strength\\" and was a little hesitant to buy this book when I heard that I would have to construct equipment myself.  I am a complete klutz when it comes to carpentry or anything of the nature and didn't like the idea of constructing anything.  Believe me, my fears were misplaced.  Most of the tools that you need are laying around your yard. <br /> <br />If you are into bodybuilding, please dont ignore grip training, because you think it will not improve your appearance.  Grip training has the been the best thing that has happened to building up my forearms.  Not only are mine getting bigger after a mere two months of grip training, but they are becoming highly vascularized as well.  Grip exercises are far superior to wrist curls.

The book has nothing that is mind-bogglingly new.  It is straight-forward and common-sensical.  However it obviously comes directly from the author's personal experience and will help you steer through the complexities that might arise should you decide to pursue a polyamorous lifestyle.     What is refereshing is that Wendy does not try to proselytizein this book: she does not try to advocate this lifestyle as the only way.  The author takes a mature attitude and one does not feel that she has adopted this lifestyle for the sake of rebellion.  In other words, the works flows from her center.  It is a postive statement that is life-affirming, not a negative rebellion against.	2005-03-28

The negative comments claim that it's an \\"infomercial marketing the Pavelizer. <br />Nonetheless, the positive statements finally won me over and I ordered it. <br /> <br />Now let's see how many pages are devoted to marketing.  The body of the book (ending with part 5) totals 113 pages.  The advertisements for his other books come after that 113 pages.  Of that 113 pages, 8 pages are devoted to pictures and text that focus on the pavelizer.  That's around seven percent of the book. <br />Keep in mind that, he does show you how to do the Janda situps without the machine but with assistance from a partner.  The pavelizer is for those people who dont have a training partner.  Fair enough.   <br /> <br />Even if we skipped the Janda situps altogether, we would still be left with 80-85 pages of other exercises which do not rely on the pavelizer.  Some of these exercises are very innovative and the ones I have tried so far are winners. <br /> <br />I do not have the background in physiology to argue one way or the other regarding Pavel's low opinions of crunches.  But I am sick of crunches and dont want to do them anyway, so it's a moot question for me! <br /> <br />On the other hand, it is fair to say that such a short book should not be so expensive: $34.95 is too much for a book this short.  I bought a used copy for about $20 bucks.  The information in the book is worth 5 stars, but because of the expense, I lower the rating to 4 stars.	2005-03-27

The early parts of the book are wonderfully free of psychobabble and contain some good insights on sexual, romantic dynamics.  <br /> <br />However, towards the end of the book, Ms. Bentley psychologizes her torrid affair with \\"Mr. A\\" and that, of course means, passing judgement on it in the analytical verbiage to which we have become accustomed and nauseated.  We dont know why Ms Bentely chooses to end the affair, but one can imagine that Mr. A decided to move on after Bentley endlessly trying to \\"understand\\" and correlate it to her childhood \\"issues\\".

Dont be deceived!  This book is a collection of 10 or so short biographies of some of the leading bench pressers. <br />They talk about how they got into powerlifting, briefly describe their routines,diet and training approach...but all of this is done briefly. The book is 126pp.  It's a small sized book with pictures on all of the pages (the pictures are usually of the particular bench presser at some event...they are not instructive pictures describing technique).  In other words there is not a lot of meat. <br /> <br />Some of the stories are inspirationaly (which is why I gave this two stars instead of one) but at $20, you'd do better investing that money in supplements or towards your gym fee.  If you see this book at a garage sale (maybe mine!) selling for a buck think of getting it.  Otherwise, pass!	2005-03-06

This hardly requires stating. The sons and daughters of the rich go to the best schools; the rich are networked in such a way as to ensure family and friends get special privleges and jobs.  As a result of all this, insiders know how to work the system.  Bush happened to have the best network and team of machiavellians during the Florida elections, so he won.<br />Second:  I am very happy to have books that do in-depth evisceration of our current President, George W. Bush.  While books by Al Franken, Molly Irvins, etc, have their place, their works read like a series of journalistic clippings.  \\"American Dynasty\\" attempts to go in-depth but ends up spreading itself too thin, going back decades to trace the familial political/economic legacy of George W Bush.  The author should have devoted one chapter exclusively to this, and then let it go.<br />The book starts to hit stride, in my opinion, around Chapter 5 (the Enron-Halliburton Administration).  This chapter, as well as the Chapters on Armaments, and the Religious right serve as useful introductions to these topics and his bibliography points the reader to books and websites for further research.<br />Good book, but the reader should not get bogged down in \\"Dynasty\\" argument of the first part of the book; instead concentrate on the last two parts.	2004-03-08

Bush	Books	4	26	33	N	N	The Best and The Scummiest	Every human endeavor has its masters.  There are leading physicists, writers, teachers, architects, carpenters and chefs.<BR>The demi-monde also has its corp of top pick-pockets, pimps, snitches and flimflammers.  It is to this latter list that we can write the name of Karl Rove. His talents add nothing useful to the world; to the contrary, he and his cabal of mayberry machiavellians' efforts are directed toward finding people's weaknesses and exploiting them, tearing down peoples lives and putting any skeletons on public display, so that \\"their\\" guy might win.  \\"Boy Genius\\" depicts the political career of Karl Rove, how he honed his skill and applied them to the benefit of conservative Republicans and especially to George W. Bush.<br />The authors do give some background information on Rove and briefly describe how he came to embrace right-wing politics.<BR>As a young man, he is described as a \\"nerd\\" and one can well imagine that he was the boy who gotten beaten up on the playground at school.  But no thorough psychological profiles are hazarded in this work.  We learn only that Rove is a rather emotionless person. The authors offer a couple of \\"Oprah moments\\" that hint that their subject might harbor some modicum<BR>of humanity.  Despite a couple of these excursions into sentimentality, Dubose et al. stick mostly to the political highlights that mark Rove's life.  And that is just as well, because we intuit that if we extracted the electoral machinations from this biography, there would be almost nothing left.<br />But reading this book reveals as much about we Americans and our times as it does about Rove.  We would hope to be titilated by some of Rove's underhanded schemes to win elections, but instead find ourselves rather bored with the enterprise.  We are used to this sort of dirty dealing and know that both major parties engage in these activities.  It's old hat.  Karl Rove just happens to be the best and the scummiest at the game that goes on all the time.The victors in political affairs are not those who present the best ideas but rather those who know how to manipulate through the electronic media.  We are given in this book an introduction to the Cardinal Richelieu of the Nouveau Regime, Karl Rove.	2004-02-04

Paul O'Neill was no stranger to Washington, so when he agreed to join the Bush administration, he knew that politics would intrude into policy making; however, his previous governmental experience had led him to believe that there would be a place for hard-core empirical facts, candor and principaled debate.<br />Alas, he was wrong on this last count.  G.W. Bush did not read briefs, rarely asked penetrating questions; conferences and meetings did not host an exchange of ideas, rather they were media circuses at which most of the cabinet knew their lines ahead of time.   The administration's policies on a number of had already been decided when Bush took office: the invasion of Iraq was already on the table in 2000, the only question was how to go about it.  Other major policy decisions had already been decided upon as well: most notably the tax cut and environmental policy.<br />So why was the maverick O'Neill chosen as Secretary of Treasury?<BR>There could be but one reason.  It was part of the script.  The administration had to provide cover for the \\"Mayberry Machiavellians\\", Karl Rove and company, as well as the neo-conservative ideologues, like Wolfowitz.  O'Neill gave the administration the air of legitimacy (as did the addition of Colin Powell and Christine Todd Whitman).<br />When O'Neill refused to tow the line, the White House got rid of him.  Fortunately, the former Secretary of Treasury with Ron Susskind in this book provides us with a window into the backroom machinations of the neoconservative conspirators and <BR>spin doctors who have brought us the largest debt in US history, a quagmire in Iraq, a dangerously negligent environmental policy, etc.	2004-01-25

Hogan's &quot;Rational Mysticism&quot; surveys the most thoughtful thinkers<BR>engaged in present-day mysticism. All have tried in some way to reconcile their mystical experiences with science and/or rationalism. The author does a good job of presenting the various subjects in a sympathetic manner, even though he does not avoid raising issues with any dubious or contradictory claims.<br />Some of the thinkers use the word &quot;enlightenment&quot; to describe the <BR>highest state of their particular discipline.  And, of course, they disagree on how to reach enlightenment.  But enlightenment is a troublesome word.  Even if we take a particular school's definition of enlightment and assume that such states can be reached, on what basis should we assign that state a priviliged position over our normal states of awareness?<br />In fact, the danger of mysticism is that we might privilege those<BR>altered states over our everyday reality and devalue our normal waking lives.  One of Hogan's messages seems to be to embrace life. Nirvana, permanent bliss, would be a monotonous state.  Long live the unfolding chaotic mysterious drama of life! I agree with him on that.  This point is also made in that wonderful movie by Wim Wender's &quot;Wings of Desire&quot;, and I could not help but think of that film as I read the last chapter of the book.<br />However, in his epilogue I think Hogan goes too far with this.<BR>He writes:  &lt;&lt;Not until I met and fell in love with Suzie [the author's wife] almost a year after the trip did my estrangement from life and from my own self finally subside.  Mysiticism did not save me; it was from that which I needed to be saved.&gt;&gt;<br />Certainly, there are dangers posed by those who choose some form of &quot;mystical&quot; practice.  One, as mentioned above, is flight from life; one can delude oneself into believing s/he has found THE TRUTH, which of course is to stop seeking truth, snuff out mystery;  one can become alienated from oneself and passively submit oneself to another person, group or ideology.  Indeed, many things can go wrong.  <br />However, Hogan's statement would have us &quot;throw the baby out with the bathwater&quot;.  If we accept a given altered state as just one of many mental states and do not make fetishises of these states, ie. fabricate ideologies and religions from them, then we can indeed benefit from exploration of those mental states.  Many people have gained insights and flashes of creativity from ayahuasca, LSD, and other entheogens.  Likewise, in a world where the flickering images of television screens have created a population whose attention span has been greatly reduced, &quot;mindfullness&quot; techniques would be beneficial to those who want to fully appreciate the richness of their lives.  These mystical &quot;technologies&quot; have their place, they just need to be brought &quot;down to earth&quot;.	2004-01-18

From the earliest years of the Left, we see some of the issues which American left-wing activists still address: purity of ideology vs pragmatism, relationship to nationalism, sectarian nit-picking, authoritarianism, foreign models vs a model truly adapted to American conditions, the problem of single issue movements vs. a broader movement against capitalism, centralism vs. decentralism, etc.  By providing a panorama of these issues within a historical context, we can see that in general, each generation of U.S. leftists repeats similar mistakes as in the past and often fails to implement strategies that have worked.<br />The U.S. Left in recent history has thrived on &quot;negative&quot; movements. This is apparent through the names of these movements: anti-war, anti-racism, etc.  When these single, negative movements come to an end, so does the whole cycle of struggle.  Often, as Weinstein shows, these movements get co-opted by liberal capitalists.  At the end of the book, Weinstein attempts to put forward a &quot;positive&quot; program of his own.  One might criticize Weinstein's program as one that could be co-opted by a liberal agenda as well: health care and education reform.  Certainly these are reforms worth fighting for, but his positive program gives no clue as how to include this program within a broader strategy of moving to a socialist society...it only is a program that would try to revamp the deteriorating welfare system.<br />Unfortunately Weinstein's history ends more or less at the demise of the New Left.  He barely mentions the anti-globalization movement and that is unfortunate.  The current anti-globalization movements face novel issues and it would be helpful if Weinstein brought his experience to bear on it.  Capital has tended reconstitute itself into global networks.  The nation-state is no longer the node in the capitalist nexus that it once was.  Vast movements of capital can<BR>take place in the click of a mouse.  Weinstein correctly says that the terrain changed with the arrival of post-industrialism, but he does not seem to fully appreciate the novelty and challenges (for the US left) of the mature informational society and globalization .  He suggests that the nation-state is still relevant in that the military- to be used as a stick against those who would revolt against the new global order- still reside within the nation-state.  That is undoubtedly true, but Weinstein does not address the other forms of control and power-both blatant and insidious- that exist within the global order.<br />Weinstein's postive program relies mostly on electoral politics; while we should not dismiss the ballot box as a locus of struggle, the author should address the potential pitfalls of restricting a movement to the voting booth.  In any case, this books is well worth reading for its summary of problems and traps that the American Left has fallen into historically.  It does attempt to promote a positive program, but it fails in this regard.  That is an important chapter that has yet to be written.	2004-01-11

William Domhoff attempts to identify the mistakes of the U.S. Left and proposes a strategy that he believes would lead to greater progressive influence and political success in his new book, &quot;Changing the Powers That Be&quot;.<BR>The suggested winnining strategies are not novel and have been used by certain sectors of the Left with positive results; unfortunately, according to Domhoff, many &quot;egalitarians&quot; (a term he prefers over &quot;progressive&quot; or &quot;socialist&quot;) undermine their efforts by persisting in errors which stem from dated theories and left-wing  mythologies. <br />Professor Domhoff makes many compelling arguments that merit close attention from those searching to clear new avenues for the Left; however, the book does not address important concerns that many U.S. progressives would have in implementing the program.  This is  particularly true regarding his proposal that Leftists enter the Democratic Party.  Furthermore, the Professor ignores the complexities of implementing his ideas in a neo-liberal, &quot;post-fordist&quot; United States; there is no mention of globalization and more than once while reading the book, it occured to me that Domhoff felt a certain nostalgia for fordism  and that he verged on breaking into song over the New Deal and F.D.R.  In fact, Domhoff's program contains a series of liberal &quot;pis-allers&quot;. <br />Now such nostalgia over the liberal welfare state is problematic<BR>in the context of globalization.  Corporations and financial institutions can transfer money and jobs fairly fast these days.<BR>One can imagine a great deal of demagogery created by the Right when the Left tries to pass laws to make liberal reforms.  We would see a hastened capital flight from this country.  I am not saying that demanding such reforms is wrong; I am saying that Professor Domhoff's vision is short-sighted in this regard and<BR>he does not touch on the issue of the need for a global struggle against capitaland, with the exception of advocating non-violent demonstrations, his strategy is pretty much limited to making political changes through the ballot box.<br />The book does, at least obliquely, grapple with a key question for the Left: are we strong enough to fight for more radical changes now, or is it better to set our sights on a short term goal of some minor reforms, and thereby strengthen the Left so that it can launch more ambitious struggles in the future?  It is a question worth pondering.  The only problem is that Domhoff's vision is one of simply reforming capitalism through an alliance with Liberals, not getting rid of it at any time in the future. <br />Domhoff's chapter on markets is provocative, if schematic; the chapter on keeping leaders accountable is sublime.  The section on foreign policy stinks.	2003-11-21

Many will argue that the current<BR>US neoconservative rampage disproves Hardt and Negri's &quot;Empire&quot; thesis.  I disagree with that.  First of all, never did H&amp;N posit that imperialism, nationalism, patriotism had died on, say, June 5th, 1999.  They did argue that the tendancy was for capitalism to reorganize itself into Empire-a dectralized globalized capitalist network that would diminish borders in such a way as to allow the smooth flow of capital globally.<br />So we should ask ourselves if we are indeed returning to the age of &quot;imperialism&quot; or proceeeding toward &quot;Empire&quot;.  I would argue<BR>that the current US neo-conservative policy is an attempt to return to imperialism, however, I believe that it is an aberration, an irregular moment in the unfolding of Empire.  In imperialism, capital is organized around capitalists according to nation-states.  And so you would have German capitalists, vying against French capitalists, etc.  But the present day formation of capital is less and less organized around national groups as it is around transnational groups.  <br />This is not to say that there do not still exist national formations of capital (after all, we saw French captialist interests in Iraq being challenged by big oil capitalists from the US)...it is to say that global capital formations are the growing tendancy and will win out over time.  So, what we are witnessing right now is very complex.  We can not expect that imperialism ends one day and Empire starts the next...they will coexist for some time to come.<br />And what about the revolutionary subject that will counter Empire?  H&amp;N call those forces, the multitudes.  The notion of  multitudes replaces the classical marxist notion of proleterian (in which the industrial factory worker was seen as the most revolutionary class).  the multitudes includes the industrial proleteriat but it does not assign it the prominent role it once had in classical marxism.  The term multitudes, as the name suggests, describes the various groups , each with its varying &quot;desires&quot;, that counter global capitalism.  Instead of a dialectical conflict betwee an proleteriat led by a so-called vanguard organization against the capitalist class, H&amp;N project the multitudes as being composed of various groups developing life according to the diversity of their needs.  This is in stark contrast to the undemocratic Vanguard Party which is &quot;delegated&quot; power and which decides the strategies, values and lifestyles for all that fall under its umbrella .<br />One problem is that Negri seems to have an almost romantic notion of the multitudes; this echos some of the naive concepts  earlier marxism held about the proleteriat.  Whenever Negri writes about<BR>the multitudes, he speaks as if they were these pure revolutionary subjects.  But that is not true.  The multitudes<BR>can be racist, religiously fanatic and homophobic.  Given this, how can we realistically consider a stateless society.  As many coming from the autonomist tradition, Hardt &amp; Negri refuse to postulate what a future post-capitalist world might look like.The reason given for this is democratically inspired:  a future world would be made up of multifarious experiments that people developed out of their being, not dictated by the vision of a vanguard party or a handful of intellectuals. <br />However H&amp;N do put forward a few demands that might guide the anti-global-capital movement:  (1) No borders and (2) a universal<BR>income.  It is clear that in the global economy the global multitude will need to find ways to unite.  The slogan, &quot;Workers of the world unite&quot; can no longer be a pleasant aphorism; it is a necessity. Much chauvinism will be stirred up and nationalism will still emerge and pit workers from one country against another.  However, if we suceed in uniting transnationally, not allowing capital any respite in any corner ofthe globe, then we can win.  This is the good news, coupled with deep analysis, that Hardt and Negri bring to us in &quot;Empire&quot;.	2003-11-13

Do not make that mistake.  This is a well-researched book that investigates the religious, scientific, racial, political and psychological dimensions - pun intended- of the penis throughout Western History, from Ancient Greece to Viagra.  On the other hand, do not fret that it is a dry tome;the author presents the material in an entertaining manner with just the right amount of ribaldry.  So interesting is the book that I read the entire 300+ pages in two sittings.	2003-10-20

Of course, this statement should be qualified.  The Left has no problems with genetics as long as it is applied exclusively to &quot;physical&quot; characteristics.  In this last sentence we can begin to already see the cracks:  how can there be such a neat division between the physical and the behavioral?<br />In this IMPORTANT essay, Professor Peter Singer calls on the Left to reconsider its position.  Certainly there have been those on the Right who have misinterpreted genetics in order to defend the status quo, defend racism, imperialism, etc;  however, it is not reasonable to condemn genetics and the scientists working in that area just because the Right has attempted to appropriate the field for its ideological purposes.  That is tantamount, in my opinion, to condemning  physics just because some have applied it to militaristic purposes.<br />It is sad to report, but there are a lot of people on the Left- and I am myself a Leftist- who thrive on tired bromides and have little tolerance for complexity.  Of course the system, culture, and class that we are born into are important.  Very few would deny that.  However, these cultural phenomena arise from, conflate with, express and sometimes frustrate certain genetic constants of human nature. <br />Denial of this has already had dire consequences for the Left.<BR>Where has there been a Party or government -Left or Right- that has not been rife with power-seeking, self-interested people?<BR>If aggression were supposed to disappear with socialism, then why<BR>did the Soviet Union invade Afghanistan and Czechoslovakia?  Why did China then pillage Tibet, attack India and even make incursions into Vietnam?  And for that matter, why were the Chinese and Soviets at each others throats after the early 60s?<br />We on The Left can continue to putour head in the sand and deny the existence of human nature; in the end this will only turn into cynicism or lead others to neoconservatism (the ranks of which are filled with former trotskyists...in the US anyhow).<BR>The wiser choice, as Singer states, would be to take into account this phenomena and reconcile it with our aims of creating a more just society.<BR>Sure, this means admitting that people often act out of narrow self-interest.  However genetics reveals another side of human nature also:  the cooperative side of human nature.  On this theme I would advise a close reading of the works by the biologists Lynn Margulis and Dorion Sagan, especially their &quot;Acquiring Genomes&quot;.<br />Singer does not propose a program, but his work does challenge us to begin thinking about this important topic and formulating our tasks accordingly.	2003-10-19

I share that opinion and recommend the book.  <br />However, I have a couple of criticisms.  One noticeable ommission from the book was an investigation into the Jessica Lynch spectacle which was a contrived made-for-prime time TV spot.  <br />This book was of course about the Iraq war of 2003 and, for that reason, it is natural that it would focus on the present administration's propaganda machine.  However, I think it would be a mistake to think that Clinton (and the Democrats) did not make use of similar propaganda tactics during that presidency.  Let's not forget that he waged war on Iraq and Serbia during his presidency (not to mention the sanctions that killed thousands of Iraqis).  Sure, he got the UN involved and his propganda campaign was perhaps not as pronounced.  But those wars were \\"branded\\" as humanitarian wars...and let's not forget about the bombing of a sudanese aspirin factory!<br />  However, if Americans think that going to the polls and voting Democratic in the next election is going to qualitatively change all of this, I believe they will soon be disillusioned.  Don't forget that most of the Democrats were on board for this war.  Only recently have they been critical, because they now think that they can get political mileage out of being against the war.<BR>This is Opportunism.<br />To its credit, the book did mention how Carter- a so-called liberal- courted the dictatorial Shah of Iran.  However, this was a brief mention.  I am afraid that the book will give the impression that Bush and the Republicans are the problem and this will give rise to the illusion that the Democrats will save the day.  At best, the Democrats may be the lesser of two evils.	2003-10-12

That said, it is in my opinion very important that the Left read books like this one seriously.  Pinkner is right to point out that much of the Left has had a knee-jerk, stupid, reaction to genetics.  It is odd that the Left which once championed science has turned its back on one of the most important fields in that domain.<br />It is important that the Left understand that there is such a thing as human nature, a human nature that is flexible but not infinitely malleable.  When we think of developing a better world we must take that human nature into account; otherwise that human nature, repressed and muffled by ideologues, will assert itself in the most horrible way. One need only point to certain of the failed attempts in the Soviet bloc as evidence of this.<br />The author makes a good point in saying that if social engineering were true, then what would prevent engineering a human race that submits to oppression and exploitation.  Indeed it is our nature to resist enslavement.  It is curious that some sectors of postmodernism, principally those who base their thinking on Deleuze and Spinoza, discuss at length the role of the body, however, they often resort to speculative thinking and I doubt many of them have taken the time to investigate genetics. <br />Although Pinkner does labor to point out that culture plays a role in shaping who were are, at certain parts of the book I felt him slipping into reductionism.  This was particularly true in the chapter on art, where he explains aesthetics from the perspective of evolutionary psychology.  It occurs to me that evolutionary psychology does have something to say on this matter, but it would be a great mistake to reduce a complex human phenomenon to &quot;the truths&quot; of evolutionary psychology.  Didnt  we have enough of that in the 20th Century with Freud, Jung, Marx, etc?  Many different schools of thought represent some aspect of the truth, but when we narrow our vision by looking exclusively through one prism, we usually finish by locking the world into a procrustean bed.	2003-09-14

Along the way, the writer introduces us to the various psychedelics in use, their effects and cultural history (i.e how they have been used throughout history &/or at present).<br />One element that differentiates this book from other psychedelic accounts is Pinchbeck raises criticisms of capitalism, often via<BR>the voice of Walter Benjamin.  We are all under the spell of capital.  We are hypnotised by commercials and advertising jingles.  We are told, by the powers that be, that capitalism is \\"natural\\", that we have arrived at some kind of Hegelian \\"End of History\\", in which capitalism has won and any attempts to imagine a different scenario, a different form of global exchange, is empty utopianism.  Unfortunately, many of us have accepted this fabrication.  And so it is, that the rainforest continues to be depleted, many people in Third World countries live in poverty (thanks to multinational corporations and the politics of debt played by such organizations as the World Bank); spiritually<BR>empty we, in the post-industrial capitalist countries, greedily seek to fill our spiritual emptiness with things, commodities. We consume more and more, yet still cannot fill the emptiness. We're like rats on a turnwheel.<br />Psychedelics MAY be PART of the antidote to all of this.<BR>Through psychedelics we are awakened from our trance and can see the world from a completely different perspective. Psychedelics spark creativity.  It has been said that Silicon Valley (where I work by the way) would not exist if it were not for acid.  That may be an exaggeration, but only in part.  Numerous luminaries in the field of computer science sought/seek inspiration through psychedelic visions.  What's more,psychedelics reveal a broader (not necessarily HIGHER) reality. As biological organisms, our brains have specialized (at least this is my opinion) and have closed out many parts of the larger reality that exists. In our everyday existence, We stare out at the world through a narrow chink and conclude that is all there is.<br />All this may sound incredible to those who have never experienced <BR>the states entrained by psychedelics.  Many believe that psychedelics are a means of escaping reality.  It is possible, like all things, that they could be used to that end.  However,<BR>for the escapist, psychedelics would not be the drug of choice.  The reason for this being that psychedelics are AMPLIFIERS, not sedatives.  If you were to use them as a means to escape some phenomenon, that phenomenon would more than likely end up in your trip amplified to the nth power!<br />I am happy that through his book an anti-capitalist orientation has been introduced into the psychedelic context.  While it is true that psychedelics have more or less defied being co-opted by capitalism (indeed there is a \\"war on drugs\\" campaign), there could be in the future an attempt to \\"integrate\\" psychedelics into capitalism.  We have seen how the \\"New Age\\" is, for the most part, a marketing scheme.  We have learned how paranormal talents, such as remote viewing, were tested by the CIA for use in spying.  Should we break through this period of \\"anti-drug hysteria\\", one can well imagine that psychedelics could be coopted for capitalist use.<br />We, instead, should use psychedelics as a means of breaking free of the capitalist mindset, envisioning other possible socio-economic systems, and re-associating with the broader reality that exists (which some call the \\"spirit world\\").	2002-12-23

That evening we repaired to the the funky living room of our Oakland district headquarters and learned from television broadcast that several anti-kkk activists had been killed or wounded  during the course of a demonstration in Greensboro,North Carolina.  A few minutes later, we received a call confirming our fears:  four of our comrades had already died and several others were in serious<BR>condition after having been shot in cold-blood by a caravan of Klan/Nazi members who had attacked the anti-Klan march organized by the CWP.<br />In her newly released, \\"Love and Revolution\\", Signe Waller, the widow of Jim Waller, one of the five to die as a result of that November tragedy, provides us  with a \\"political memoir\\" that spans several genres. It is at once a biography of the victims of the Greensboro massacre, autobiography of the author,  reportage, chapter in American history, political analysis and activist handbook.  Ms. Waller writes in two voices: the first is that of the young Signe  Waller, leftist militant circa 1979; the other voice is that of  Signe  Waller, year 2002.  Combining these<BR>two perspectives, Ms. Waller allows us access to the passionate thought processes of a young revolutionary as well as the sobre reasoning of  a seasoned activist culling the wisdom of her experience.<br />Who were the five slain?  Dr. James Waller, age 36; Dr. Michael  Nathan, 32; William Sampson, 31; Sandra Smith, 28; Cesare Cauce, 25.  These were extraordinary individuals. Collectively, they were collegiate student body presidents, Phi Beta Kappa,members,graduates of the University of Chicago, Duke, <BR> and Harvard Divinity and accomplished physicians. Poised for professional success and the material comfort and bourgeois respectability that  would have afforded, they chose instead to live, work and struggle among the poor and working classes of<BR> NorthCarolina.  To this end, four members of the CWP5 took low-paying and dangerous jobs in the textile mills of North Carolina and arm-in-arm with other workers fought for better working conditions and pay.  <BR>                                                 <BR>Co-workers recognized the dedication and skill of<BR>these openly-radical CWP member, electing them as<BR>local Presidents and shop stewards. In addition to their trade-union activities, the \\"5\\" also participated in the  anti-apartheid movement, struggles for better education, and anti-racist actions.  After a long day's work at the mill, Dr. Waller gave gratis medical treatment to the workers and their families, even paying for the pharmaceuticals when his patients were too poor.<br />In the Summer of 1979, the CWP along with other townfolk confronted and routed the Ku Klux Klan in China Grove, North Carolina, where the racist organization had been terrorizing african-americans and inter-racial couples.  Emboldened by <BR>this victory, CWP leadership in North Carolina called<BR>for an anti-klan  rally and march to be held in the<BR>predominantly black neighborhood of Morningside <BR>in Greensboro.  The CWP publicly dared the Ku Klux<BR>Klan to show up at the rally and even sent the white <BR>supremacists a letter to that effect.<br />The Klan did show up on November 3rd, accompanied by<BR> Nazis with whom they had  recently forged an alliance.<BR>On-the-scene television crews recorded the fatal <BR>shootings.  The CWP, complying with police orders,<BR>were not armed and, therefore, could not mount a<BR>defense.  As one Klansmen noted, it was a \\"turkey<BR>shoot\\".<br />In the wake of November 3rd, evidence came forward<BR> that proved this was more than a brutal assault by the KKK/Nazis.  Sure those groups pulled the trigger  but it was later brought to light that the Greensboro police and even the FBI had been in complicity and even helped organize the<BR> attack.  Given the amount of conspiracy theory we encounter on the Internet, the sceptic should certainly be  wary of such a statement.  To this I can only reply, \\"Read the book!\\"<br /> In the last pages of \\"Love and Revolution\\", we learn<BR>that today Waller still  believes in the ideals of her<BR>youth: an egalitarian society and no war.  She  does not berate her years in the now defunct CWP as youthful folly.  Mistakes were made from which she has learned and evolved.  <br />She criticizes the rhetoric of the CWP.  The CWP<BR>talked tough but was in no position for a military<BR>confrontation.  This fact in no way justifies <BR>the argument of some at the time : that the CWP \\"got<BR>what it deserved\\" or provoked.  The fact is that the<BR>CWP was leading a peaceful \\"unarmed\\" demonstration. <BR>Nonetheless, the group's aggressive rhetoric did make<BR>it possible for their enemies to portray them as violent.<br />She also criticizes the Leninist party structure,<BR> democratic centralism. It was according to her \\"long <BR>on centralism and short on democracy\\".<br />I couldn't agree more.  As a one-time member of the<BR>CWP, I found rhetoric and democratic centralism<BR>perniciously fed into one another.  The rhetoric alienated me, divided me from myself.  Often I could not distinguish my true thoughts and feelings from Party rhetoric.  When one did offer an <BR>unpopular opinion, there was always the threat that<BR> it would not be fairly judged  but simply rejected as a symptom of \\"petit-bourgeois\\" orientation or my youth(I was only 19 at the time).  Due to this censorship by others, or even  self-censorship, there was NO chance that a regular cadre could influence party policy. In my opinion, not only democratic<BR>centralism but the party  model, which aspires to mediate the desires of so many under a united platform, deserves to be tossed in the trash bin.<br />I hope that this book will be studied by many<BR>activists. I also hope that it will serve as a call to<BR> reawaken all those ex-members of the CommunistWorkers Party who have fallen into the slumber of middle-age. A better world is possible and, as Signe informs us,we are being \\"convened by martyrs\\"	2002-11-27

Burroughs	Books	5	3	7	N	Y	The World of William Burroughs	After a failed attempt to read \\"Naked Lunch\\" I turned to this book to gain some insight into William Burroughs that might aid me with future reading.  I did not find that the book went into great detail about Burroughs ideas, except for ones that I find either trivial or even \\"wacky\\", like his interest in some aspects of Scientology and Reich's \\"Orgone Box\\".  In fact, I might have given up on my plans of reading Burroughs after reading this biography; I could have easily concluded that Burroughs was a man who had led an interesting, albeit tragic, life but who, because of his heroin use and open homosexuality, had just become a \\"trendy\\" author. I might have concluded that he was a precursor to the cultural revolution of the 60s but of little importance today. Quite frankly I persist in my quest of getting to know Burroughs because of the importance attributed to him by one of my favorite philosophers,  Gilles Deleuze, who claims that Burroughs has a lot to teach us about the \\"society of control\\".  Only my future readings of Burroughs' novels will reveal rather I am right to persist in my study of him.<br />If this book failed in being an intellectual biography, it certainly succeeded in portraying the world of William Burroughs in an interesting fashion. Burroughs life seems for the most part<BR>a series of tragedies.  It appears as though he was molested as a youth and one is tempted - perhaps due to the saturation of \\"pop psychology\\" in our day- to conclude that somehow his future misfortunes (and brilliance) were rooted in that event.  Subsequently driven from the United States, then Mexico (where he committed the infamous \\"William Tell\\" fatal shooing of his wife) he spends the greater part of his life wandering between Tangiers, Paris, London and New York.  Oddly enough, he only seems to find some kind ofhappiness at the end of his life in Lawrence, Kansas.  <br />His meeting with the other members of the \\"Beat Movement\\", Allen Ginsburg, Jack Kerouac, Gregory Corso, seemed fated, and unlike the others he did not become a \\"Beat Stereotype but remained authentically himself, behaving in many ways like a conservative midwesterner.  Perhaps this authenticity is what appealed to his groupies who could not manage to retain their own identity separate from the various trends in which they participated.<br />Whether I will find anything intellectually stimulating in the works of Burroughs remains to be seen.  Despite his many shortcoming, he was a key cultural force in undermining the foundation of the narrow, cocktail sipping, coutnry club 50s generation.	2002-11-20

He culls what he needs, mostly from the Oriental tradition, in order to construct a project of spiritual hedonism.<br />Watts thinking and approach to life are emblematic of the 1960s,<BR>even though his quest began many years prior to that tumultuous decade.  He rejects the transcendental God, super-ego and status quo, in favor of a spirituality of immanence and id.  This coincided with the human potential movement, blossoming at that time.<br />It is interesting to consider, however, how far the human potential movement in its latest incarnation - the new-age movement- diverged from the course laid down by Watts.  For one thing, though he was a popularizer, Watts was undoubtedly an intellectual and would accept little or nothing as a matter of faith. The \\"New Age\\", on the other hand, seems to be intellectually vacuous.   Like newagers, Watts did turn to the Orient for answeres.  This may originally have been inspired by a sort of exoticism, but after having tried to frame his spirituality withinin the epicopalian faith (he became an ordained minister),<BR>Zen/taoism turned out to be the best vehicle for him.<br />The New Age seems to have reconstructed a more Oriental God, who nonetheless resembles the fatherly God of their Catholic/Protestant parents.  This God says \\"Thou Shalt\\" (although his rules are slightly different) and looks after his followers as a shepherd does for his flock.  This takes many guises...the New Thought one, where if you supplicate to God and repeat enough affirmations, God, under the sobriquet of \\"the Universe\\" will grant you what you want...or the guru, in traditional costume or in his new thread as psychotherapist.<BR>Watts rejects all of this transcentalism.  He accepts the notion of karma, becoming as one acts,(but not necessarily the new age conception of karma which clings to the idea of returning in a next life).<br />On the one hand, the new age is either ascetic or it fully embraces hyperconsumersim.  It is apparent throughout this biography that Watts rejects both of these paths.  On the one hand, he does not envision the body as fallen spirit, but as part of the universe, hence part of God, and to be celebrated.<BR>This is to be done through wine, food, sex and many other ways.<BR>On the other hand, he is wary of the money game, and a blind pursuit of things.<br />This was my first reading of Watts, though I had listened to a few of his recorded lectures.  I shall read more.  I am particularly interested in understanding this question of the \\"illusion of the ego\\", in comparison with concept of the individual from the point of view of cartesianism or postmodernism.<br />Apart from those concerns, it was an enjoyable read.  I found the first 50 pages, concerned with his childhood, to be a bit slow, but after that it was a real page-turner.<br />Thomas	2002-10-12

However, unlike Kafka's characters he chooses a different response to the oppresive society in which he finds himself.  He chooses desertion.  Rather than take on the system, he flees it and tries to construct a life of dignity.<br />Unfortunately that choice brings him hunger and loneliness.  We can liken the consequences of his choice to those made or imposed on people living outside of the suffocating world of corporations and money.  They are treated with contempt and subsist on low income.  The choice of living outside of the machine is not always a pleasant one.

Scientists explore a curious planet, Solaris, whose ocean appears to be an intelligent life-form.  Scientists are sent to live on the planet<BR>for purposes of establishing contact.<br />Contact is elusive however. What is to be the medium of communication?  Even without the tool of  verbal language,<BR>humans can empathize and communicate to some extent with other mammals.  We know that they share common instincts and emotions with us, such as fear, sex drive, hunger, etc.  But what about something so \\"other\\" as this solarian ocean?<br />Finally indisputable evidence of contact arrives.  Solaris is able to tap into the scientists brains and create exact replicas of significant persons from their past.  These replicas look and act in the same way as the people they simulate.  The main character Kelvin has before him Rheya, an ex-lover who had committed a suicide which he could have prevented.<br />This leads to another problem of communication:  how to understand the intentions of this action?  Has Solaris created the simulacra as a cruel joke,   Or did Solaris do this to please the visitor?  Is Solaris just doing it as a kind of experiment?<BR>The scientists are tempted to judge the planet according to human behavior, but realize that would be folly.<br />Humans view others, not just Solaris, but any other species, or even any other human being through the prism of their subjectivity.  To reach the other requires an incredible effort of will...it may be impossible.  Kelvin is at once in love with the succubus and tormented that \\"she\\" is not really Rheya, in spite of the resemblance.  The succubus is evertyhing that Rheya was to Kelvin because she is nothing but a collection of his memories.  Fine, but who was the real Rheya?  Just a scattered collection of a few bits of the real Rheya mixed in with Kelvin's own desires, fantasies, and fears.  So this raises the question of how possible it is to go beyond ourself to another human being.<br />Another problem raised is that of self-communication.  Another scientist in the book, snow, makes the point that humans only know about two percent of their thoughts and that Solaris probably knows more about them than they do themselves.<br />We humans do seem \\"walled off\\" and communicability at this stage of our evolution is pretty minimal.  Science does seem a valiant attempt to get beyond our fears and fantaises, but as philosophers of science have proven, even our science is fraught with subjectivity.  As for understanding ourselves, as Terence Mckenna say, the various schools of psychology sound like medieval hawkers.<br />Or is this seperateness all an illusion as Heidegger and some mystics claim?  The difference between subject and object was reinforced by cartesianism.  In that case, how to overcome the symptom of a seperated, isolated ego?<br />This is not the place to attempt an answer.  However, this book will give you a lot to think about.  I recommend that it be read at least two times succesively.  You will probably miss many of the finer points during your first read.  The time spent on careful readings of this book will reward you with many interesting ideas to ponder.<br />Thomas Seay	2002-09-30

Colin Wilso is an author interested in extraordinary human beings.  Having read some of his other books, I read this one, my first \\"true crimes\\" book ever.<br />It is a survey of some of the worst serial killers of the last forty years or so.  An initial perusal of the book had me perplexed as to why there were so little devoted to Charles Manson.  Having finished the book, I now know why.  Manson is a girl-scout compared to some of these serial killers!<br />I wish that Wilson had speculated as to why we are fascinated with serial killers.  Part of the reason may be that we, \\"normal people\\", are so regimented that we secretly admire (in some ways) those who go outside of societies norms.  Certainly we read these accounts, for the same reason that some of the criminals commit them...we are bored.<br />Interestingly, Wilson posits that murder follows a sort of shadow-side hierarchy of needs,  as proposed by Abraham Maslow.<BR>Previously murder might have been committed to attain certain basic needs like food or sex, but nowadays it is carried out as an attempt to self-actualize.  Wilson also points out that serial killing has risen with the age of equality.  Society gives lip service to \\"equality\\" but this turns out to be a sham in light of the disparities of wealth and notoriety.  About this, Wilson comments that most serial killers are from working-class bacgrounds, and the crimes are committed as a way to acheive the status that eludes them in society at large.<br />This book is a survey and does not go into great depth with any particular serial killer.  Frankly, it goes into enough detail for me and I wouldn't care for a huger dose of gore.<br />Only \\"glitch\\" that I noticed...Wilso cites the case of a murder in Sweden carried out by a man who has been put into a hynotic trance by another man.  Wilso, who has studied the paranormal for over 30 years, should know that you cannot cause a person to do under hypnosis anything that he would be against.<br />Other thanthat, it was a good introduction to this genre.<br />Thomas	2002-08-16

The author  documents the paranormal powers of Ted Owens in this book.  He admits that Owens' demonstrations were accomplished outside scientific controls.  Of course, it is a huge leap to make, but considering the amount of evidence and the witnesses, I assume that Ted Owens' did indeed possess these incredible powers.<br />However, there is a \\"sub-plot\\" to this book, whether or not Mishlove intended it.  It concerns how would monkeys like us use such a gift, if we possessed it.<br />Reading this work, I found myself wishing that I, too, possessed such a gift.  No doubt other readers fantasized about it as well.<br />There are several reasons why one would want such a skill, but the desire for \\"power\\" and the freedom that comes with it must figure prominently.  Many \\"new-agers\\" wont like my use of the term \\"power\\", they prefer much more \\"positive\\" and potentially deceitful verbiage as \\"spiritual progress\\".  However, I am not using \\"power\\" negatively but neutrally.  It may be \\"power\\" to help or to harm.<br />Like all \\"technologies\\" there is nothing inherently good or evil with psychokinesis. However, as in the case of Ted Owens, we can see what happens when a powerful weapon gets into the hands of one with a big ego who wants to prove that he is \\"right\\".  Ted Owens' believes that he has the right to use any means necessary to prove the validity of his powers.  People die, property destroyed...but \\"the ends justify the means\\"...How many times have we heard that in our history....and if you think that Ted Owens is an ethical/moral aberration, better go and read some history or, just as good, look around you or even in the mirror.<br />I am unable to discern whether PSI powers are something that are growing stronger in humans or whether they were previously stronger in humans, are dying out, and remain rare gifts enjoyed by a minority of humans.<br />Of course, if given the chance, I would jump at the opportunity to explore these powers.  However, I think we should be CAREFUL.<br />People will label PSI exploration as a \\"spiritual\\" exercise and thereby do a sort of semantic exorcism of the potential dangers involved...Just keep in mind the atrocities carried out in the name of religion.  The label of \\"spiritual\\" gives these activities the appearance of being \\"other\\" and \\"good\\".  Instead, we should look at these powers as another human phenomenon and, therefore, be wary of potential human abuse.<br />Thomas SeayCAREFUL.<BR>People will label PSI exploration as a \\"spiritual\\" exercise and thereby do a sort of semantic exorcism of the potential dangers involved...Just keep in mind the atrocities carried out in the name of religion.

For many years I have wanted to compare notes with some of my old political colleagues and try to evaluate what happened during the movement and what went wrong.  This book definitely sets a framework for analysis of the movement.<br />A couple of criticisms of the book.  I felt that it was quite good about summarizing the period 68-73 but was a bit shallow on the period 1974-1980.  For example it barely mentioned the huge<BR>miner strikes that took place in the late 70s and the involvement<BR>of the NCM in that and its ramifications (having grown up in West Virginia, this is how I got involved).  Also, I thought the few lines devoted to the Greensboro massacre and the CWP5 warranted more attention as this had huge ramifications not only for the CWP but for the rest of the Left as well.  Another important struggle going on at that time was the student anti-apartheid movement, in which the NCM was heavily involved,<BR>which gets no mention at all in the book.<br />The author does a good job of pointing out the overly optimistic<BR>expectations of the movement, the top-down anti-democratic<BR>vanguard leninist structure of the movement's groups, the movement's tendancy to be blinded by marxist-leninist dogma,<BR>and it pursuit of ideological purity as opposed to building<BR>a movement based on existing conditions.<br />I definitely recommend this book to those interested in US Leftist history, those who were in the movement and still licking their wounds, as well as young people who are getting politically involved now and who want to avoid the errors of the NCM...	2002-05-10

Almost all streams of the radical Left in this country have one source..Leninism. It was Lenin who created the one party state and who began the suppression of all opposition. The American Left has carried forward this model with disastrous results: small fragmented left groups, each claiming a monopoly on the truth. This happened with the old CPUSA, the 4th Internationale Trotskyist movement (of which Wolforth was a leader) and the new Communist movement that emerged in the 70s.<br />We need to shed this model and build a pluralistic, heterodoxic democratic Left. Mr. Wolforth's book sheds light on this and provides other lessons for our movement from his rich experience.<br />Thomas Seay	2001-08-20

Very basically it portrays the negative effects of technology on our society.  Overwhelmed by information, we become anesthesized to our environment....we must filter out some the data that bombards our system, and indeed we filter out most of it.  Our systems so burdened by the information that we treat all things with indifference....except for our own death, which remains the one thing we would like to filter out of our consciousness but dont seem able to do so.<br />Now, this all recalls the dry writings of Heidegger or Baudrillard, but instead DeLillo will have you laughing til you cry with certain passages.  We have a Professor who is head of the &quot;Hitler Studies&quot; department (one thing about information overload is that people specialize in minutiae).  His colleague, Murray, who philosophizes over food labels, wants to start an &quot;Elvis Studies&quot; department.  <br />The concept of the &quot;hyperreal&quot; is evoked.  For example, there is a tourist site near the college.  It has no other appeal than the fact that it is the &quot;most photographed barn&quot; in America.  Throughout the book we see the characters, just like many of us, concentrate on image rather than substance.<br />I have noticed that there is a review below by a man that claims that neither he nor his &quot;brilliant&quot; wife the engineer found anything of interest in &quot;White Noise&quot;.  I, too, am an engineer and know, by the way, that most engineers find themselves (often victims of self-deception) &quot;brilliant&quot;.  I speculate that the reason they could not understand this book is that they are too submerged in the &quot;white noise&quot; world of consumerism and information.  In addition to that many engineers are afraid to address the issue of the dark side of technology.<br />	2001-06-13

It was written in as dry a language as I have encountered (and considering I am an engineer who has to read extremely dry technical manuals, this is not an observation to be taken lightly).<br />I dont know if Mr. Merkur is unable to write well or, as I suspect, he feels that by assuming this dry removed tone his work will seem more scienitic and objective.

It is apparent throughout the book the extent to which Laura loved and admired Aldous.  Nothing wrong with that.<br />We learn the truth about his alleged &quot;blindness&quot;, his view of psychedelics and how he handled death.  Although through my readings it was apparent that Huxley was a brilliant man of letters, the biography brought to light the kindness of the man. He was, according to Ms. Huxley, willing to avail himself and his knowledge to anyone who sought it (except perhaps reporters from whom he understandably sought sanctuary).<br />Even though I am sure it was unintended, we also come away with some notions about Ms. Huxley.  Her devotion to Aldous, open-mindedness, and self-effacing manners shine through.<br />I liked the book, but somehow felt the picture was incomplete. Certainly Huxley must have had an interior struggle between his religous beliefs and his intellect.  Such a struggle is not discussed in this book.  Perhaps Ms. Huxley was unaware of such a struggle or perhaps Aldous had somehow transcended it by the time he met Laura.	2000-11-21

He asks himself if the corrolary of &quot;tune in&quot; and &quot;turn on&quot; has to be &quot;drop out&quot;.<br />He also underscores the importance of paying attention to &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot; (the attitude of the user and the physical environment in which the user takes the psychedelic).  He rightly notes that a lot of people pay lip service to this idea without being rigorous in it's application.  There seems to be a kind of libertarianism, even philistinism, in the contemporary psychedelic scene.  We're going to explore alone without paying attention to the lessons from other cultures who have used these substances for thousands of years.  Understandably we do so under the banner of authenticity, but I think we lose out.  We should not ape or follow the lessons of those cultures dogmatically, but we should investigate them and heed what is good...especially about set and setting.<br />Third, he assigns psychedelics their proper place.  They are tools.  And like any tool, psychedelics work for some and not for others.  Or they work for a time for us and then we need to leave them behind.  Any way it goes, we are left with integrating the lessons learned from our psychedelic explorations into our everyday life.<br />This is a sober treatment of the role of psychedelics, not an absolute glorification.  I love to dream and hypothesize along with Terence McKenna, but I also love the grounded nature of &quot;Cleaning The Doors of Perception&quot;.<br />If you are interested in a serious discussion of psychedelics,please check out our webclub &quot;Entheogens and Psychedelics&quot; at  [...]<br />TSEAYof psychedelics,please check out our webclub &quot;Entheogens and Psychedelics&quot; at  [...]<br />TSEAY	2000-09-22
