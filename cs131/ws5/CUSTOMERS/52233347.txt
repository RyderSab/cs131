He has chronicled the African American experience that begins with the 20s through the 90s.  Two of the plays, Fences and The Piano Lesson, both written in the mid 80s, have won the Pulitzer Prize.<br /><br />Set in 1969, Two Trains Running takes place in a small diner in Pittsburgh.  The diner regulars include Risa, a waitress who scarred her legs in an effort to keep men away, which eventually works;  Sterling, an ex-prisoner who depends on luck to find work rather than the hard way;  Hambone, a mentally challenged middle-age man who was cheated by the white man for work he had done.  Still after 9 years, his only and constant words are \\"I want my ham.\\"  Wolf is a numbers runner who uses the diner for his business and Holloway has a strong belief in the supernatural.  Also included are the funeral owner, West and diner owner, Memphis.<br /><br />Urban renewal is a recurring theme in Wilson's work.  Tearing down buildings has been an ongoing project and now the city has an offer for the diner owner, Memphis.  He holds out for a respectable offer from the city. Memphis is logical with values but he doesn't have much faith for equality, freedom and justice or the black-is-beautiful concept.<br /><br />The play opens with the restaurant regulars commenting on the townspeople lining up outside West's Funeral Home to see the dead Reverend turned Prophet Samuel.  They believe some luck might pass on to them.  Funeral home owner, West, is a regular at the diner and he and Prophet are looked upon as two who got rich cheating people.<br /><br />The play doesn't have much in stage direction as it takes place at a diner counter.  Little direction is needed.  As for the vernacular, Wilson uses the language of the day, however, it would seem that the African Americans in this poor community did not enunciate as well as the words were written.<br /><br />If you haven't read Wilson's work, start with Ma Rainey's Black Bottom Band and Joe Turner's Come and Gone.  There is wonderful insight to memorable plays.  These two are the beginning of the decades of African American experience.  .....Rizzond Joe Turner's Come and Gone.

With an intention to skim, I became wrapped up in the life of Johnny Cash.  This was a complete chronicle that focuses more on the entertainment side of Cash's life.<br /><br />Cash endured lots of pain that starts with losing his brother in a freak accident, the self destruction of a druggie lifestyle, trials & tribulations of trying to stay musically on top, exhaustive touring, pain of aging, and most of all, the anguish of poor health with debilitating disease.<br /><br />You won't get too much out of the very personal deeper relationship with June, only what we already knew, how she struggled to save him from himself.  There is very little about his daughters, in fact, there are no pictures of the daughters except Roseanne.  We only learn how absent he was in their lives, and while he was home, he was still absent!<br /><br />It was rumored that June was not the best singer and their son John Carter Cash lacked talent too.  As a singer, Carter Cash's voice was weak compared to his father's.  In the book, the author provides some quotes of sharp criticism toward young Carter Cash.  Johnny Cash kept family close and they always performed with him.<br /><br />Many aspects of Cash's life were covered chronologically.  Knowing how celebrity stories change through the years, the author provided more than one interpretation of an incident.  What I appreciated is that the author gave several versions, interpretations, or stories about the man and incidences, because with celebrities, several versions exist.<br /><br />This book reveals so much about the album hits & misses.  It is surprising how many albums he made, and how many didn't make it to the top.  You get a full sense of his druggie lifestyle, and the damage that goes with that.  Much is written about Cash's religious influences and how he incorporated it to his musical career.<br /><br />And then, of course, the health problems, you just can't help but feel his pain.  Although Johnny wanted to perform til his was dead, he pretty much did that... and maybe he should not have.  It's difficult for us to see our idols age!!<br /><br />An epilogue was inserted to reflect the death of June and mention of Johnny's death on Sept. 12, but there isn't much on the deaths.<br /><br />What is included is a huge selective discography and a lengthy index.  The author mainly received his info from sources that included articles, books, etc.  It's clear that he didn't get much from the Cash family but did speak with brother Tommy Cash and close friends.<br /><br />Note:  Don't get distracted by the use of English spelling, such as recognise, harmonise, programme, etc.<br /><br />If you are into a blow by blow account of his professional and religious life, read this one!.....Rizzoat... and maybe he should not have.

Hate Mail Through the Ages is comprised of a collection of mail sent to literary agents, TV personalities, public utility companies, chain stores, etc.<br /><br />The editor put a call out for amusing, interesting hate mail received through the years.  Somehow, he has collected historic hate mail most likely from print elsewhere.  The editor writes in his introductory chapter how this compilation came together.<br /><br />In the 70s, an atheist Madelyn Murray O'Hair received numerous insulting and degrading mail.  Literary agents receive mail that ran a theme of frustration over manuscripts, while  TV executives normally receive mail about on-personalities and TV programming.<br /><br />But, without a doubt, the funniest mail comes from the average person, who doesn't know how to write, edit and they cannot express their frustration clearly.  People without some writing experience have a tendency to write \\"just as they talk\\".<br /><br />And if it isn't the unclear and convoluted message they convey, it is simply what they have to say that reveals their frustration.  Some letters were hysterical!  To me, these letters were the best part of the book!<br /><br />This book was printed in 1979 and since we are in the age of email, it would be quite enjoyable to dig into someone's hate EMAIL, I'm sure there is plenty around!.....Rizzo	2005-05-25

First, it was very well-written, well-structured and most of all, the translation was excellent!  To translate well is critical, but the correct message and exact feelings told must be conveyed to the reader exactly as the foreign author intended.<br /><br />I became engrossed in this suspenseful plot that begins with a strangulation, grisly butchering, packing and disposal of a one's husband.  The plot involves changing personalities within the characters and there are those we have sympathy for and those we truly learn to despise.  We follow them throughout and we have hope and fear for them.<br /><br />The backdrop is the underbelly of Japan and the story evolves out of a depressed working and home environment, where gloom prevails, and despair sets in.  We enter the story as four women who endure rigid labor at a box-lunch factory.  A sharp contrasts exists between the dirty gritty environment and the strict rules and regulations for proper hygiene at the box-factory.  Aside from the mechanics of the box-lunch factory, you will enter into the world of illegal gambling and loan sharks.<br /><br />Lucy-san and Ethel-san Gone Real Bad!<br />When one woman, Yoyoi, strangles her husband with a belt, and her co-worker-friends Masako and Yoshie dismember the body, I couldn't help speculate that when the grisly task is assigned to the small home bathroom in daylight, something is bound to get screwed up.  If anything will go wrong, it will!  Then, with the uninvited advance of a third co-worker, the slip-ups unfold and suspense builds.<br /><br />A Gruesome Twist<br />With many suspense stories, you can anticipate twists, but the surprise was a chilling revelation.<br /><br />And not to spoil the ending, it wasn't as much a surprise that what was to happen.  It was merely the IDEA that something else.....more gruesome than one can imagine....had to happen.<br /><br />Movie in the works<br />Yes, I understand in 2005, a movie will be OUT.

It is a scene where a proud father who refused his son for twenty years now encounters him when he is released from prison for murder.<br /><br />In the series of plays that chronicle the black experience,  Jitney is set in the early 70s and is about jitney (car service) drivers who provide low fares to the black community in Pittsburgh.  The setting is in a dilapidated section of town that is experiencing the city  boarding up buildings, a practice that characteristically doesn't result in improvements.  The building that houses the car service with that of several men's livelihood is considered for boarding up.<br /><br />The characters are young and old, a busybody, an alcoholic, a young father, a Korean war vets,  etc.  These characters have minor stories, but nothing as profound as the main character, 60ish Becker, who manages the jitney car service.  It is his son Booster who was spared the death penalty and is released from prison.<br /><br />At that time of the murder, many young blacks did not take well the treatment from whites that their parents were subjected too.  These younger blacks grew up with an attitude and were shamed that their parents didn't stand up to white folks.  The younger generation resorts to violence.  Consequently, Becker's son Booster kills a white girl for lying that she was raped by him.<br /><br />Becker, a man of honor, is humiliated by the actions of his son.  Becker also confirms that Booster's mother died very soon after sentencing.  She could not bear to hear from the judge ....\\"that the life she brought in the world was unfit to live.\\"<br /><br />This lengthy exchange of dialogue between Beck and his son is profound and with  Act 1 Scene 3 and 4 makes up the entire worth of the play.....Rizz	2005-03-15

Recognized as a great American playwright with numerous awards, August Wilson has brilliantly chronicled the black experience through decades.  Depicting the 1920s, he wrote \\"Ma Rainey\\" in 1982, a real life blues singer.<br /><br />The scene for \\"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom\\", takes place in a recording studio in 1927 where two white music executives are making a record with blues singer, Ma Rainey and a group of musicians.<br /><br />Because the focus is on four male band members. it may take a while to try to put a face with each character, but within a short time, you grasp who the characters are - their values, beliefs and fears.<br /><br />Ma Rainey's tone of voice is profound and nobody can push her around. Some critics report that Ma Rainey was exploitive and abusive to her band members, but I certainly did not get that impression. She was just tough and she knew how important her role was in blues music!  Ma Rainey didn't take any crap from the white executives or anyone.<br /><br />The dialogue interweaves with Ma's performance onstage and the band members during rehearsals.  Their identities evolve and it's clear who and why they are as they share their experience with racist America and we then know their role in a racist  society and industry.<br /><br />A dramatic ending caps the story when the most bitter player reacts violently when another member steps on his shoes.  To me, the incident seemed unjustifiable to provoke such a violent reaction by another member. It appeared out of place.<br /><br />If you have an interest in the work of a great playwright or another interpretation of black experience through the decades, read more from this amazing man.	2005-03-02

With an intention to skim this book, I became engrossed in what Suzanne Somers had to say about her life before fame and living with a severely alcoholic parent.<br /><br />She shares vivid details she endured at the hands of her father, low self-esteem, shame, fear, anger, violence, craziness, hostility, chaos and more. As she describes her pain and emotional feelings, she backs up what she says to give the reader some better understanding of her behavior or that of the alcoholic.<br /><br />One example is when her father ripped her nicest clothes she wore while attending school. With a heavy object, she almost cracked his head open and feared he was dead; she blamed herself and begged that he not die. Asking herself why she reacted with violence over simple clothes, her response was that the clothes were a mask that hid who she really was and a mask to the shameful crazy sick homelife. She helps the reader by explaining thoughts and actions taken.<br /><br />The story begins when she was a child and it follows Suzanne after she left home to reveal a chaotic financially struggling young woman with a kid, early marriage, affairs, abortion, therapy, and so on.  Fortunately, she and Alan Hamel, a Canadian producer, resolved their edgy relationship combining two families and they lived happily ever after, since she is still married to him as of 2007.<br /><br />Suzanne's mother was not a drinker, but too weak and powerless to intervene.  Back in those days it was easier to let drinkers just be drinkers.<br /><br />But I am baffled how a mother allows a man to be cruel to her children, to destroy their spirit and soul?  I'm quite sure the mother's esteem is broken down too.  To me, there can not ever be any excuse to torment children.<br /><br />The final notes Suzanne Somers shares come from a dinner/entertainment act sponsored by the Alcoholics Anonymous, initiated by her sister Maureen, who has recovered. Two brothers followed the path of their father also. Somers feels grateful that her entire family has recovered or is in the process. This book was published in 1988 and her father had been free of alcohol for 10 years.<br /><br />This is a very well-written book that helps to understand the family dynamics and the troubled alcoholic....

But what would really enhance the reading of the play is to see it performed on stage, provided the actors are superior enough to carry this one off.  It would require great competence, not only with the excess dialogue, but with an ability to interact with invisible characters, a manipulation through 11 stage doors and with a stage full of empty chairs.<br /><br />French dramatist, Ionesco died in 1994 and is known as a foremost playwright in the theatre of the absurd.  In an internet article by Dr. Jan Culik on Theatre of the Absurd,  French philosopher Albert Camus defined the human situation as meaningless and absurd.  Playwrights of the absurd agree that man is inhabiting a universe with which he is out of key.<br /><br />This play is comprised of three live characters: Old Man, Old Woman and Orator.  Included are several invisible characters;  However, the third character, the Orator, has little to say and appears at the end.<br /><br />Two old people, a man 95 years old and his wife, 94, have an endearing relationship and live surrounded by water where the only transportation is by boats.  Their existence is mundane as they repeatedly share old stories.<br /><br />In his earlier days, the Old Man believes he suffered enormously as merely a man soldier or general factotum (an assistant) and, early in the play, his wife frequently reminds him that he lacked willpower or ambition to have been a head admiral, a head president, a head general, or head doctor, etc.<br /><br />Now, he invites a room full of guests (invisible) who will occupy the many chairs.  The guests include all the intellectuals to hear his philosophical message because he believes that humanity must profit by what he has learned.  He hires a professional orator to relay this message.  And right here, is where the play seems like a bad dream, as the orator plays a small but significant role.<br /><br />Like any other great literary work, to fully benefit, it may require a second reading.  This is an excellent and very unique play with the Ionesco-style tragic dream/nightmare ending.

It was not racism that sparked Nathan McCall's violent hate-filled nature; it was his black hoodlum homeboys/gang peer pressure!

They graduated to  selling drugs, breaking and entering, robbing people, stealing excessively from a large department store that eventually led to the demise of the store which evolved into a slew of out-of-work black people.<br /><br />Throughout his life, he impregnated women he truly didn't care about and, like many irresponsible men, black or white, he rarely was a force in the childrens' lives.<br /><br />The violence imposed on other black people for something as simple as disrespect was his downfall as he shot another black man, lied to the judge that it was self-defense and was lucky to get away without jail time.  It was armed robbery at  McDonald's  that led him to prison.<br /><br />From youth to an adult, McCall was steeped in anger and hate toward the white man so much that it \\"ate\\" at him.  And my response to him is ... it's no wonder the white man watched you in the store or why a woman in the elevator was scared of you.... or why a person held tighter to their purse as you walked by.

Chapters are categorized with titles that provide a clear definition to aspects of his life.  The chapters follow through his youth, women, work, prison, Islamic study, children, marriage, divorce, to the Washington Post.<br /><br />This is a book that young men need to read.

The fascinating dramatic play focuses on the life of an addicted, dysfunctional family that suffers greatly with their demons of the past.  Eugene O'Neill's 1940 autobiographical story takes place in one long day and proceeds into the brooding night.  It is a courageous account of the tortured soul and his haunted family.<br /><br />In a dedication to his wife, O'Neil writes, \\"I give you the original script of this play of old sorrow, written in tears and blood.\\"<br /><br />The setting is August 1912, at the summer home where the fog lays heavily, foghorns blow loud contrasting with the chime of bells.  The mood is somber just like the symbolic recurring fog that impairs vision and obscures reality.  The bells are symbolic of the convent where the main character Mary Tyrone was happiest.<br /><br />The focus of the family is Mary, 54, wife, mother of two sons, wife of Tyrone.  At the beginning, we are left to imagine and second guess what is bothering Mary and later it is clearly defined that she is addicted to morphine.  Mary lives in the past, where she was in a convent and had a dream to be a concert pianist.<br /><br />James Tyrone, 65, an alcoholic known by his family as a miser, and whose real concern was to invest money into property rather then family because of a nagging fear from his childhood days -the threat of the poorhouse.  He was considered a handsome stage actor and regrets what he could have been,- a great Shakespearean actor.<br /><br />Jamie Tyrone - the elder 34 year old son, another alcoholic always labeled a loser by his parents.  He has a love-hate relationship with his younger brother Edmund as Jamie's confesses that because of his own hatred of himself, his role was to make his younger brother a failure too.<br /><br />Edmund Tyrone - 24-year old son is a reader of great literature and an aspiring poet.  He has tuberculosis and with concern wonders whether his miser father will send him to a shabby institution.  Eugene O'Neill is the real-life character of Edmund.<br /><br />O'Neill provides readers with more than adequate stage direction;  we get a real sense of the way we are to interpret the readings including the shifting moods.  This is a book that keeps on going.  It is superb.  And if you ever want to see this play come alive, see the movie with Katherine Hepburn.  Her remarkable portrayal of Mary was memorable!  ....Rizzo'Neill is the real-life character of Edmund.

There is a voice in this book, and you can just HEAR  this guy as he admonishes writers and drills into their heads the step-by step guide to reporting and writing.  The tone is firm with a direct approach to feature writing as the author is adamant that, \\"reporting and writing can NOT be divorced.\\"<br /><br />I like the sharp conversational tone; it's like sitting in the classroom.  He is very clever with the similes and metaphors to clearly drive his point.<br /><br />Although this book has made the rounds for years, Blundell offers refreshing ideas and unique insight to writing.  He speaks of experience as a Wall Street Journal writer.  This is HIS voice, and not a slew of other professional writers churning out a how to book.<br /><br />I like a quote of his when he tells us that the READER requires specific information and our first priority is to meet that requirement and also that the reader has a deeper and more universal need that has to be met or, he flees.  The author said,  \\"nothing is easier than to stop reading.\\"<br /><br />You won't find the usual writing book addressing topics like these. A sample chapter is Raw Materials - generating ideas;  Extrapolation (beyond the event lies a broader, more significant story);  Synthesis (assembling promising story ideas from what looks like a junkpile of spare parts);  Localization (thinking big);  Projection (declining to follow the media sheep to a pasture already overgrazed)  and Viewpoint Switching (thinking of a story as a piece of terrain with varying topography).<br /><br />Also topics titled  Shaping Ideas; Story Dimensions, Planning and Execution, Organization, and you get great insight into Handling Key Story Elements that delves into the dreaded leads and endings.<br /><br />What is interesting in a unique approach to his section titled Wordcraft.  He assumes that you the reader already know grammar, syntax and usage.  So his goal is to show us how to achieve certain effects at certain places in the story.<br /><br />You will read some full texts on sample stories that are sprinkled throughout the chapters.  Blundell  also provides reading material for the writer.  He says,  \\"whole forests have died to fill the marketplace with other writing books.\\"  One suggestion is  Zissner's \\"On Writing Well.\\"<br /><br />This is a unique writing book and is meant to read completely. ....Rizzotexts on sample stories that are sprinkled throughout the chapters.

It is almost incomprehensible that a child can go from the frying pan - unabandoned by parents,  to the fire - negative grandparents who didn't know that an expression of love and devotion is critical to life.<br /><br />With no father, and an extremely pathetic unstable mother, at ten he went to live with his grandparents.  And it is this sad life that is the backdrop for the show, except that his TV mother is based on the mental cruelty received from his real-life grandmother.<br /><br />There are some great funny moments and you don't have to be Hispanic to understand a dysfunctional crazy family.  George shares some bits from the comedy show and he painfully recalls his grandmother's mentally abusive behavior.<br /><br />The two comedic influences were Freddie Prinze, Sr., from the &#34;Chico and the Man&#34; series in the 70s and one of the greatest comedians who told us what life is really about, Richard Pryor.  Lopez talks fondly about a Long Beach, CA performance, &#34;Richard Pryor Live&#34; and I agree that it is the funniest live show ever!!<br /><br />Lopez, like other great comedians, shares the struggle to the top, the comedy clubs, the road, the bombs, the rejection, depression, etc., etc.  Any great artist and comedian can tell you the struggle to success and some can just tell you the struggle.<br />George dutifully and proudly then toots his own horn!

Born in 1902 and died in 1968 he exemplified diversity in storytelling as &#34;Tortilla Flat&#34; demonstrates freshness to the ear.<br /><br />The story's main character Danny becomes an heir to two homes, but his paisanos in the small town of Tortilla Flat convince him to &#34;rent&#34; one home to them.  Paisanos are of  Mexican, Indian, Spanish and assorted Caucasian blood.  None of his friends can pay rent; they live off the benefit of others.  Steinbeck ingeniously plays out a humorous story of camaraderie, loyalty, wine, women and more wine.<br /><br />The paisanos share a philosophy that boasts good honest intention leading to a justifiable need for wine instead.  The plot continuously unfolds with humor, wit, bonding, hospitality, visions, treasure, ethics, scheming, greed and evil.  The friendship of all men evolves and slowly disintegrates as they separate.<br /><br />Their philosophy is a departure from the socially conventional:  Pilon, feeling guilty about owing Danny rent money, takes a job, earns two dollars in a day, and intends to pay Danny some rent, but he is swayed by the power of wine.  He says &#34;If I give him hard money, it doesn't express how I feel toward my friend.&#34;  He buys and indulges a present of wine for two dollars and tells Danny it cost five dollars.<br /><br />To get eggs,  Pilon knows of neighbor, Mrs. Morales' chickens.  He feels  if he tears a hole in his fence, the chickens would like to nest in his tall grass.  If they didn't pick her apples, they would spoil anyway.<br /><br />When the house Danny rents to his friends burns, the men move in with him, and soon the story compounds as they scheme and entice more friends in.<br /><br />Drinking cheap wine is a priority among the group as money is a chief problem.  But with their loyal friendship they share laughs, music, more women, more wine, pets, and stolen or borrowed food.<br /><br />The story is wonderful and Steinbeck book's are always page turners.  He fills each page with critical vivid diction and brilliant prose.<br />Steinbeck's  most famous classics include the novels, The Grapes of Wrath, East of Eden, Winter of Discontent, Cannery Row  and the Wayward Bus.  Some of his very successful short stories are The Pearl, Of Mice and Men, The Red Pony, The Moon is Down, etc.  There is an extensive collection of non-fiction such as his journals:  Travel with Charley, Sea of Cortez, Russian Journal.  His stories were often set in California, his birthplace.<br /><br />Read this, it is extremely enjoyable!  ......Rizzowonderful and Steinbeck book's are always page turners.

Every page is interesting, every word, and there is never a dull page.  In true Melamud style, the stories are short but powerful.  The superb writing of the plot moves consistently.  However, I did get the feeling toward the end that a number of dramatic sequences seemed crammed at the end, and without the minute attention paid to the earlier part of the story.<br /><br />The plot evolves in post-war, a neighborhood in New York  among an aging Jewish grocer whose deli/food store business struggles amidst modernism and greedy competition.  The main characters, Morris, his stoic wife Ida and a grown daughter Helen live above the store and work long hours to keep it alive.  Daughter Helen yearns to have a loving man and an education.<br /><br />Enter Frank Alpine, a young Italian man who after a criminal act upon Morris, and unbeknown to Morris,  Frank lands a job in the store to pay his debt.  Here, he continuously fends off  his demons while attempting to follow a morally correct life and in his command, the store goes through economic and physical changes that fluctuate greatly, not always good or bad.  And, as expected, he falls in love with the daughter and their relationship takes turns and twists too.<br /><br />Immediately, Melamud gives us a distinct picture of the desperation the family endures.  You can grasp with ease the images and separation of personalities.  This is done with precision applied by the finest authors.  We get more than we anticipate, when Melamud provides extensive insight into his character descriptions, and most important, to their thoughts.  Above that, he provides us with questions and answers we might need to further develop the characters thoughts and actions.<br /><br />After absorption into the story, I still had questions and I'm sure you will too and maybe it takes another read.  Overall, the short classic is excellent.  ........Rizzo	2003-11-06

Every word, every page was profoundly interesting, whether details were sadly moving or funny, the message was clear!  This is a short and meaningful read.<br /><br />As a person who was geographically distant, Colorado, from the tragedy, the horror effected the nation and me emotionally.  When I learned that Pulitzer Prize winner and author Halberstam had written a book about that specific firehouse that lost 12 men, I wanted to read it.<br /><br />Once you begin reading, you easily learn who the firemen were, their decisions to become firemen, their odd quirks, their funny moments, their other jobs, their passions, and of course their family.  What is moving is the strong sincere bond they share, unique friendships, caring people willing to give their time to help each other out.<br /><br />It was the talk that Joseph Ginley, whose firefighter son John Ginley died that made a profound impression.  The father told them firefighting was a good life, you lived with other men in genuine camaraderie, and you ended up, almost without realizing it, having the rarest kind of friendships, ones with men who were willing to die for one another.<br /><br />I came with a strong understanding of how a firefighter truly becomes this spirit of humanity and someone willing to give up their life for you.<br /><br />On the inside cover is a memorial, the original blackboard with the names and their assignments.  It's eerie.  And as Halberstam begins, he shares just enough facts about the firehouse in Manhattan, it's origin and renovation.  We learn the dynamics of highrise firehouses versus suburban firehouses and its firemen.<br /><br />Then, you are immersed into a personal portrayal of each firefighter.  And it isn't just an account of each man, the details offer more than you bargained for.  The information is weaved strategically and suttle.  It's very clear that Halberstam conducted a serious number of interviews, because he got such remarkable information that doesn't come with one or two interviews, it comes for a volume of detail about a person.  Upon reading these intimate details, as you delve deeper into what made this fireman, his values, friendships, faith, family, etc., you can't help but keep looking at the pictures, putting a face with the name.<br /><br />Clearly, the writing is what really made this a special account.  What a warm feeling I get from these men who are strangers to me, but I learned about a &#34;true fireman&#34;  and am reminded by what veteran fireman Ray Pfeifer said, &#34;People think they know what we do, but they really don't know what we do.&#34;  I say..people..... educate yourself here, because those faces on the back are real people, real firemen, the firemen we really don't know or understand.  And when you finish this book, you will look at firemen differently.....  ...

Carver, a master at dialogue and often called a minimalist, created stories with substance where a mystery looms beyond the surface, stories so commonplace, with common people doing common things.<br /><br />It's true, the stories are laced with people who endure alcoholic sadness, financial burdens, emotional immaturity and those just searching for the dream that doesn't quite happen.<br /><br />We get a glimpse into their lives and these characters reflect everyday America whether it was the 60s or the 90s.  Those characters are his life and they are us!  Read any Raymond Carver story and you can identify with some element.<br /><br />Referring to the title, \\"Fires\\", Carver is talking about two strong influences in his life, one being Gordon Lish, at that time, a literary editor and the other, John Gardner, who said to become a writer you need the necessary \\"fire\\".

As he says, \\"- and this is the thesis of my book -to the interstices between the stories as well.\\"<br /><br />The more I read this book, I'm not sure I can buy this theory.  The word intratextuality, in the book, is defined as when the texts in a text begin to refer to each other in ways that seem to refer to their doing so.  Here, the authors who knew Carver personally make their assessments.<br /><br />An example Runyon refers to in his own words:  In \\"Neighbors\\",  the Millers' fascination with their neighbors is answered by the fascination exerted on the couple in \\"The Idea\\" by  \\"their\\" neighbors, as well as by the fascination those neighbors themselves fine for the very idea of voyeurism.<br /><br />What he references to in \\"Intimacy\\", is the last line, \\"the narrator sees the need to pick up the leaves strewn, while the beginning of the next story, \\"Menudo\\", the narrator is unable to put up with the accumulation of leaves.\\"<br /><br />In Carver's story \\"Collectors\\",  narrator Slater, waiting for the mailman,  would `look through the curtain'  while the next \\"What Do in San Francisco?\\", the narrator becomes the mailman who tells that the resident, Marston, would be `looking out at me through the curtain'.\\"<br /><br />Sure, there are undisputed connections and underlying themes in all Carver's stories, but to follow this idea would be too complex and, at times, a little to deep.  How much can you make out of  whether one character is looking OUT a window, versus the other story's character is looking IN.  Storytelling is just a choice of wording,  opposing characterization for different stories.<br /><br />The beauty of Carver stories and poems is that they are NOT complex and deep!  His are meant to savor the conversation, to read beyond the surface, to feel the story, feel the characters, their happiness and pain  regardless of their personality.<br /><br />Enjoy Raymond Carver as you would any other author, and to go to the extreme of finding some connection or stories strategically placed is quite unnecessary!  ...Rizzocomplex and deep!

And they must spill out for several pieces for several different genres of writing, whether it is a poem, a play, an editorial, lyrics to a song, anecdote, dialogue, monologue, etc.  That's what a multi-genre piece is all about, because it incorporates your vision of several voices for your paper.<br />Romano shares stories about his generational family.  He is a high school teacher and became inspired with the genre writing of &quot;The Collected Works of Billy the Kid&quot; by Michael Ondaajte.  With this book, he began to teach his students how to express themselves with the use of multigenre papers.<br />There are plenty of examples from his students to guide you.

His interpretation is that if boys are reading, they are questioned as to why? and coaxed to engage in other things instead of reading.

But I believe now, all is well with the brothers.<br /><br />Marsalis, on the other hand, shares keen insight into the world of jazz, his composition style, and rhythm including his relationship with the trumpet.  About the trumpet, he says \\"you can never force the trumpet, you got to baby it, treat it gently, coax it.  It's always there when you need a high note, or something very loud.  If you don't handle up on it, it won't respect you\\"<br /><br />He teaches us about playing the songs and how the members produce an evening's show.

It may be no surprise that he is also an accredited author with his  books by  \\"Marsalis on Music\\" and \\"Sweet Swing Blues on the Road.\\"  Wonderful read....Rizzo	2001-10-20

WHAT HAVE YOU READ THAT'S GOOD?<br /><br />That's the question outsiders ask  book club members that has prompted this collection of  favorite books to read.<br /><br />If you would like to explore the world  of fiction and nonfiction books, and don't know what to read, examine this paperback by Victoria Golden Mcmains.  She has chaired, since 1977 the Bay Area Book Reviewers Association and has a column published monthly and is also an author with short stories published in literary magazines.<br /><br />The book is more than a start, it is a treasure!  She endorses book clubs, the benefits and recommendations on how to form a book club.  One helpful hint is on how to choose a book club.<br /><br />McMain says that something wonderful is happening to books, people are reading them.  Oprah's Book Club has certainly rejuvenated the art of reading and also brought  little known writers to attention.  In this collection are very few Oprah's recommendations.<br /><br />Each book review listed is limited to one page, and at the bottom of each page are several questions to ask about the literature.  You are asked questions about a quality of a character, how he/she makes you feel, situations, choices made, predictability of story, idea of change in the story, contributions, transformations, etc.<br /><br />Answering and analyzing these types of questions will give you an increasingly better insight into the author's mind.<br /><br />And, if you do belong to a book club, the author says these are questions to provide discussion and food for thought.<br /><br />Some of the Choices:<br />Included are stories about war, love, fantasy, political intrigue, biography etc.<br /><br />Bless Me Ultima -  Rudolfo Anaya - A boy's life is altered, his  aunt Ultima, a curandero, (healer) visits.<br /><br />Wild Swans - Jung Chang.  True account of one family's life in China; violent revolution of Chairman Mao.<br /><br />Black Boy - Richard Wright.  A classic childhood memoir.  Also read \\"Native Son\\".<br /><br />The All of It - Jeanette Hainen - deathbed confession in Ireland creates dilemma for local priest.<br /><br />Lake of the Woods - Tim O'Brien -  A mystery about a married couple, his wife turns up missing.<br /><br />All Over But the Shoutin' - Rick Bragg - a poor white southern boy tributes his mother.<br /><br />Fire on the Mountain - Edward Abbey -  bold and strength, a rancher & U.S. gov.  trying to claim his land.<br /><br />Rose - Martin Cruz Smith - an explorer sent to Africa to find a missing young minister.<br /><br />Daughter of Persia -  Sattareh Farmaiian - A women's journey from her father's harem to Islamic revolution<br /><br />Bitter Grounds - Sandra Benitez - rich and poor families tied to El Salvador's coffee plantations<br /><br />Animal Dreams - Barbara Kinsolver - finding sweet life among sweet good people.<br /><br />No Ordinary Time:  F. & E.
