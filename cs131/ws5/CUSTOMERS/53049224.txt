Intriguing either way	When I was in college, I picked up Ervin Laszlo's \\"Introduction to Systems Philosophy,\\" and it was one of the most fascinating things I'd ever read.  He was not addressing repeatable experiments to verify predictions of specific experimental phenomena.  He was trying to come to realistic grips with something we all experience though we had no scientific models at the time to cover it. He was trying to describe how wholes relate to interacting parts.<br /><br />Whether a result of his observations or just cultural evolution, it is now relatively commonplace to accept, under the banner of various different terms and theories, that complex systems have their own properties distinct from those of their individual parts.  The simple rules followed by individual ants lead to something unexpectedly interesting when there are hundreds of thousands of them forming colonies.<br /><br />I think it is in this spirit that Laszlo's recent work should be first considered.  He isn't trying to come up with a way to predict particular experimental phenomena, as far as I can tell, he is trying to capture larger patterns of empirical evidence with greater generalities.  His respect for science and mathematics and his undeniable brilliance distinguish this effort from most of what you might find in the \\"Speculation\\" or \\"Metaphysics\\" section of the local bookstore.<br /><br />The general notion that Eastern and Western cosmologies contain different perhaps complementary visions is hardly revolutionary any longer, nor can it be credited (entirely) with any particular scientific progress, unless you are going to say that new metaphors are all there is to building new theories.  That would ignore the equally great significance of the epistemic values and social processes unique to the scientific tradition, as well as the unique aspects of Eastern cosmology, which are not just or primarily some sort of \\"New Physics.\\"<br /><br />His brilliance and credentials don't seem to protect Laszlo in many reviewer's minds from guilt by association with the many books that have made silly attempts to describe Eastern cosmologies in Western terms and vice versa.  This is a shame.<br /><br />Nor do they protect him from legitimate criticism that this is not quite science.  It is probably better called protoscience, or science-philosophy.<br /><br />While Laszlo is careful with evidence and analysis once he has granted the existence of phenomena based on experience, he has somewhat different criteria in selecting the legitimate domain of phenomena than most physicists would share, and very different than most psychologists would share.  Psychologists spend a lot of time trying to understand perceptual and cognitive illusions and distortions that can lead to experience being misinterpreted.<br /><br />The skeptic would probably say that some of what Laszlo is using as the base for his theories is better explained in psychological terms rather than physical terms.  However that would miss the underlying point that looking through a different lens makes different evidence look valuable, and leads to different modes of explanation.<br /><br />Looking through a different lens does not eliminate the need for explaining all of the relevant phenomena, but it can sometimes make different phenomena seem relevant.  Like many intellectuals before him, Laszlo is looking at both physical and human phenomena through an \\"interconnectivity\\" lens and seeing something different from mainstream science.  And he is careful enough and clever enough that if the human phenomena he assumes are real ... are really real ... then his theory is something much more interesting than just idle speculation.<br /><br />Yes, this might be \\"mind candy\\" in a sense, since it is as much speculation and philosophy as science, but it is intellectual mind candy that follows most of the rules that make for good theory, if his assumptions and evidential base are valid.  And that makes it a fascinating read formany of us, even if it strays from mainstream science.that makes it a fascinating read for many of us, even if it strays from mainstream science.	2005-06-21
US	53049224	R1NE29WEYSHGG2	0691117942	5822850	America's Crisis of Values: Reality and Perception	Books	5	17	18	N	N	Thought-provoking and timely synthesis	The best thing about this book is that it raises a number of very profound and important questions in a way that makes you think deeply about them.  If you have any interest at all in what insight scientific reasoning can bring into large scale human behavior, this book will truly make you think.<br /><br />Rather than the usual political diatribe, this is: (1) an exceptional objective summary of what is special about the United States drawing from a wealth of previous work, (2) a wide-ranging and balanced analysis of the widespread American perception of waging an internal culture war at the turn of the millennia, and (3) a speculative and potentially somewhat testable (but largely untested) cyclical theory of cultural crises in general as a product of both endogenous and exogenous factors.<br /><br />Baker finds no empirical support for the theory that American traditional values have diminished over time, and support for only a loose coupling of our polarized moral orientations (which he refers to as absolutism and relativism) and our religious beliefs and social attitudes.  In this context, absolutism simply refers to the core idea that ultimate authority must come from a transcendental and perhaps eternal source, while relativism is the core idea that authority resides in the individual.<br /><br />Baker finds that our political parties are highly and increasingly polarized but that when it comes to particular issues, Americans of all stripes tend to share more values and attitudes than they differ about, in spite of also being a mixture of absolutists and relativists.  This is because he finds that our moral orientation is only loosely coupled to our religious beliefs and social attitudes.  People can have the same religious beliefs yet differ in social attitudes, and vice versa, and similarly for our moral orientations and our religious beliefs.  There are atheist absolutists and Christian relativists.  Absolutists and relativists live and work and worship and debate side by side in the U.S. rather than representing a divided social structure.<br /><br />When political pundits try to put every social issue in terms of the two sides of the culture war (usually Christians vs. Secularists), according to Baker's analysis they are making an unwarranted assumption that beliefs, attitudes, and moral orientations are much more tightly coupled than they really are.  Thus they are exaggerating the polarization of the nation.  The question is ... why do we do this, and why does it seem so compellingly true?<br /><br />Baker's data shows besides an elevated sense of anxiety over the economy, what made the 1980's most distinctive was that across every demographic category, huge numbers of Americans went from being moral relativists to being moral absolutists.  Prior to 1980, by far most Americans answered survey questions in a way that revealed them to be moral relativists, but by 1990 we were half relativists and half absolutists.  This even division, according to Baker, emphasizes the contrast between these different moral orientations and the respective different guides they provide to conduct and the evaluation of goals.  It is this even distribution of absolutism and relativism that Baker theorizes creates the impression of being a divided nation, even though our traditional values have during the same period remained entirely stable, we have remained remarkably independent of the secularization trend of the other modern nations, and we are actually converging over time rather than polarizing over social issues (with the notable exception of abortion).<br /><br />So Baker does find a gap between the facts of American culture revealed by values surveys, and American'ss perception of their own values.  However he does not dismiss the gap as a matter of mass hysteria or ignorance or simply political propaganda.  The primary purpose of the book is to engage in a systematic analysis and understanding of the \\"adaptive\\" or \\"functional\\" reason for this gap.  The assumption is that perceiving ourselves as waging a culture war is important for some reason and that our public rhetoric has adapted to that need.  The adaptive reason that Baker comes up with is that America is unique in being a nation united by creed and ideology rather than by culture, and so as a result of our unique cultural heritage, traditional values have become the thing that make us Americans.  Traditional values are on one end of one of Baker's well-validated values scales, the other end being secular-rational values.  Secular-rational values are what the modernization and secularization theories expect us to see increasing as a nationâ€™s wealth increases and as they shift from agriculture to industrial and service economies.  We see that happen all over the world very consistently, except for the United States.  The United States maintains its traditional value orientation over time because that is the source of its sense of identity as a nation and many Americans begin to feel threatened when they see evidence of encroaching secularization.  In spite of highly visible legal conflicts over the interpretation of the establishment clause, we still share the same traditional values that unite us as Americans.<br /><br />One of the main sources of confusion over American values can be seen in the second well-validated values scale that Baker uses: survival vs. self-expression values.  Many discussions of values do not distinguish these two scales, yet factor analysis shows them to be reliably independent.  Although Americans have retained their traditional values and have not moved increasingly toward secular-rational values as predicted by secularization theory and as seen in other nations, we have moved particularly far and quickly from survival values to self-expression values.<br /><br />Self-expression values combine with traditional values to give the unique hybrid found in American culture, we internalize both traditional values and individualism, and these are actually different guides to conduct.  The result is, according to Baker's theory, a uniquely motivated search for meaning among Americans in trying to reconcile their mixed traditional and self-expression values.  This is an interesting and unexpected aspect of Baker's synthesis: he says that the contradictions created by traditional + self-expression values create a cognitive dissonance, leading to the feeling or perception of a crisis of values.<br /><br />Baker gives just enough background to make his point and show its relevance to his argument, but never so much that I forgot the point he was trying to make.  You'll be introduced to various theories of religious history and cultural evolution, various psychological theories of how beliefs and attitudes are related, several fascinating maps of the values of different nations and how they have changed in recent years, and a revealing look at how absolutism and relativism affect our thinking.aptive\\" or \\"functional\\" reason for this gap.

The Myth of a Polarized America (Great Questions in Politics Series)	Books	5	133	141	N	N	Political class is polarized, but the rest of us can think!	This is a very brief and tightly argued book of enormous relevance to us in 2004. It makes the following remarkable points:<br /><br />1. On close inspection of individual opinions, the vast majority of the electorate in the U.S. are *moderate*, not radically polarized into liberals and conservatives. That is, most of us are, as we would like to believe, capable of thinking independently for ourselves rather than strictly along party ideological lines.<br /><br />We are a _closely_divided_ nation, as reflected in the very close recent elections, however we are NOT a _*deeply*_divided_ nation. That is, we are not really a nation of two distinct warring camps and a couple of swing states as the media sometimes present it for dramatic purposes. Fiorina sugests that we are actually something close to an ambivalent nation which divides itself in poltitical matters because we have no choice when presented with highly divided options.<br /><br />2. The American public has *not* become dramatically polarized even over such hot topics as abortion. Rather, relatively small differences among us have been magnified by the rhetoric used to present the issues to us.<br /><br />3. The political choices we have are determined by a distinct class of politicians, party activists, and interest group leaders, who *have* become increasingly polarized over moral and religious ideology as well as economic ideology.<br /><br />4. A large part of the polarization of the political class has been the result of the realignment of the South, such that republicans aligned aggressive foreign policy with hostility to the welfare state, and democrats aligned antiwar sentiment with support of those at risk. This is represented particular well by the \\"gender gap\\" which widened at the same time this realignment or tuning of the ideologies of the parties was taking place.<br /><br />Fiorina suggests that when Bill Clinton once said early in his presidency that he was Pro-Choice, but against abortion, most Americans knew what he meant, that most of us, liberal or conservative, do not want to legislate morality for others, even though we have a clear sense of what is right and wrong. Fiorina also points out for example that most 80% of us believe that abortion should be legal under some conditions (even if wrong), and illegal under others. The extremes at each end which promote unconditional rights for unborn babies or for mothers are roughly the 10% tail at either side of a normal curve.<br /><br />Finally, he also provides data showing that the averaged opinions of self-identified liberals and conservatives regarding abortion differ only regarding under what specific conditions they think abortion should be legal, not the legality of abortion in general.<br /><br />The result is that the supposed \\"culture war\\" is really a war between increasingly ideologically polarized political parties and their activists who arent really even aware of each others reasoning, with most of us in the middle getting hit by friendly fire from both sides, but being forced to choose between them.<br /><br />The bottom line for Fiorina's argument here is that we are a nation currently creating unneccessary internal conflicts and indulging in \\"culture war\\" polarized issues like gay marriage or unconditional rights of various kinds that are really of concern to a relatively small and unrepresentative number of us. They are sold to us by political parties and the media because of their drama rather than their relative importance. It's hard for me to look at the political ads for either of the current candidates in 2004 without nodding agreement on this.<br /><br />Our political system provides us with ideological extremism on both sides, and seems to have no desire or ability to change itself, whereas most of us caught in it would usually prefer pragmatic and non-ideological solutions to issues that address larger numbers of us.<br /><br />I read this at the same time at Juergensmeyer's book \\"Terror in the Mind of God,\\" and it is chilling how much the \\"culture war\\" among the political elites comes to resemble the \\"cosmic war\\" of good and evil that Juergensmeyer theorizes leads to real violence under some conditions. If Fiorina is right, we may not really have a (popular) culture war at all, but we could create one if it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy as we come to accept it uncritically.<br /><br />If Fiornia had a solution for this centrally important problem, this book would merit 6 or 7 stars. However, just by pointing it out so clearly, it merits the highest rating I can give it.<br /><br />Please read this important and timely book.me time at Juergensmeyer's book \\"Terror in the Mind of God,\\" and it is chilling how much the \\"culture war\\" among the political elites comes to resemble the \\"cosmic war\\" of good and evil that Juergensmeyer theorizes leads to real violence under some conditions.

It is also very strong on explaining the reasoning behind these views.<br /><br />It is also extremely frustrating if you come to this subject from a cognitive neuroscience or psychology background hoping to sort out the relationship of scientific theories of brain and mind and the classic epistemological question.  I come to this book not as a philosophy student but as an interested outsider who is accustomed to interdisciplinary accounts relying on science to some extent to help address philosophical questions, and vice versa.  With that expectation, this book just does not do a very good job clarifying things in terms of modern science, or even discussing the relationship of classical epistemology with science.<br /><br />Much better books on modern epistemology that at discuss the relationship of classical epistemological questions and testable scientific theories include:  \\"Inquiry and Evidence\\" by Susan Haack, and Alvin Goldman's work.  Unfortunately, those don't serve as well as an introduction to the reasoning behind the epistemological questions, and they require some background in the basics to appreciate.  Michael Williams' \\"Problems of Knowledge\\" is another good introduction that some will find a little more accessible that Audi.<br /><br />If you're willing to dig in and deal with learning the foundations of epistemology independently of science, this book seems to be particularly good.  However if you want a good broad overview of what we know about the mind and knowledge right now covering all disciplines, this will definitely dissappoint.	2004-10-29

We all share a basic intuition from our daily experience of doing things with our own hands: very complicated things require effort and planning to get them right, and the more complicated and interlocked and interdependent their mechanisms, the more effort and planning they require.  Dr. Simmons does for human physiology what Mike Behe did for biochemistry before him; he describes some excellent examples of complicated, interlocked, and interdependent mechanisms in the human body, and then steps back to admire them and say, \\"how could all this wondrous complexity and interdependence be the result of an *unguided* physical process?\\"<br /><br />Dr. Simmons builds on this intuition and gently guides his readers to the conclusion that the evolutionary worldview of the scientific orthodoxy is essentially implausible.  As William Paley and intelligent design author Phillip Johnson have implied or stated, natural selection really only makes sense to us intuitively if we make the assumption that things weren't designed by a creator specifically for a pre-planned purpose.  So intelligent design authors question whether we should make that assumption in science.<br /><br />Against that intuition, the scientific orthodoxy presents natural selection, a seemingly unlikely blind process whereby random accidents can accumulate to produce intricate purposeful designs.  It isn't a difficult task for Simmons to present the logic of intelligent design as more having more surface plausibility than that of natural selection.<br /><br />Simmons takes us on an illuminating trip through the mind of the intelligent design believer.  How does a medical doctor come to reject mainstream biological science in order to present the body as a collection of \\"gifts\\" and \\"plans\\" inserted into it by a creator?<br /><br />Simmons approvingly quotes William Dembski that evidence for design in nature would mean that naturalism was wrong.  Ironically, the scientific orthodoxy of evolutionary biology that Simmons believes he is debunking also looks for evidence of design in nature, but as part of natural processes rather than a prior plan.<br /><br />The bulk of this book is an illustration of what human physiology would look like if it were seen through the eyes of someone who had an appreciation of many of the body's mechanisms, but saw them as having been pre-designed by a creator rather than the result of a history of descent with modification.  It contains a long list of mysterious gifts, whose origin is incomprehensible.  Pride, fear, imagination, and doodling are all things that were given to us for our own use rather than being built on a rationally penetrable natural history.  Our immune system is \\"structured to protect us\\" rather than possessing a learning to recognize host cells from pathogens using a Darwinian selective process.  Simmons asks the reader to simply guess whether they think these gifts could be the result of mutations and survival of the fittest, and then choose the most plausible \\"belief.\\"<br /><br />That is the essence of intelligent design and what distinguishes books like this from biology and medical books.  It asks us to rely on our mysterious gift of intuition to choose the superficially plausible belief that complex things are pre-planned rather than trying to understand the powerful adaptation analysis used by evolutionary biologists to discover the real origin of biological \\"gifts.\\"  It would be hard to find a better explanation from an ID critic than Simmons own reasoning as to why this is a problematic approach to understanding biology.  Seeing natural mechanisms as mysterious pre-planned gifts rather than trying to plumb their details is exactly what distinguished the scientific tradition from the medieval church.  If we want to understand living things, their history matters, and there is no rational path from \\"mysterious gifts\\" to their origin.<br /><br />In the worldview of \\"intelligent design,\\" the body also contains genetic mechanisms that construct bodies according to strictly predestined trajectories.  It contains plans rather than processes.  The intricacies of physiological processes seem difficult or impossible to break into component mechanisms and the weaknesses in their design are hard to imagine and impossible to explain except in terms of a deliberate and inscrutable flaws inserted by the designer.<br /><br />This book also does a great service because in exemplifying the reasoning behind intelligent design so clearly, it reveals the common conceptual links between the different forms of creationism.  Simmons certainly doesn't claim that the world was created 4,000 years ago using Genesis as a technical manual or that the story of Noah is literally true. His reasoning about how natural phenomena can and cannot be explained, the cognitive processes he uses, the metaphors and intuitions he builds upon, are all nearly identical to those who do believe those things.  Living things are what they are, designed for their purpose in their current form.  The whole notion of living things changing continually over time to adapt to their environments apparently seems as bizarre to Simmons as it does to the Seventh Day Adventists.<br /><br />To appreciate what I find interesting about this book it is important first to recognize that \\"intelligent design\\" books represent a metaphysical and theological position even when they are not explicitly religious. They offer a way of seeing the universe as meaningful.  Simmons exemplifies this spiritual search in his introductory section when he describes his \\"conversion\\" from Darwinism.<br /><br />Simmons describes his conversion from Darwinism as the result of his patient attempts at understanding his resolutely devout evangelical Christian wife, his personal quest to find the world comprehensible, and his finding several authors who were struggling with similar questions and found orthodox neo-Darwinism unsatisfying or unsatisfactory.<br /><br />Explicitly theological answers were unsatisfying to him and natural laws plus chance events seemed to be the on that was available to explain everything.  Most thoughtful people can surely relate.  He was instinctively pursuing the classic modern quest<br /><br />of finding meaning in a seemingly meaningless universe.  Surely, \\"unguided physical processes\\" fail utterly for most of us at achieving this.

If they are related, it becomes more difficult to explain the use of non-religious rationales for violence and terror.<br /><br />I think Juergensmeyer does a first class job of research here and a really excellent job of pulling together his findings and making sense of the way violence arises at the extremes of a wide variety of religions.  Most importantly, he identifies the conditions under which piety \\"becomes\\" violence in some sense, based on the broad idea that we use religion to make sense of the world, and under extreme conditions, symbols of war and expressions of violence do indeed make sense of our experience.<br /><br />I would like to see work building further on this general framework, I think it would be extremely productive in understanding patterns of violence and developing workable solutions.<br /><br />The one weakness of this analysis for me was its implicit equation of religion with the search for meaning.  We tend to think of religion in that role, but I believe it is important not to confuse the way we often use religion with its many varied expressions and uses.  Juergensmeyer's analysis DOES apply to any cultural process that operates to make sense of our experience, including atheist quasi-religions and potentially even meaningful non-theist institutions and practices.<br /><br />That is, I agree up to a point with the critics here who complained that this book's analysis of piety and violence seems to ignore the systematic use of violence by institutions we don't generally consider religious.  However, I don't think it takes much to extend the author's analysis to these other institutions.  Some of the conditions under which MJ theorizes that we view a war as having cosmic significance and thus relating piety and violence:<br /><br />1.  The struggle is perceived as a defense of basic identity and dignity.<br /><br />2.  Defeat is unthinkable.<br /><br />3.  The struggle is blocked in practical terms and no real world solution appears to be viable.<br /><br />With these conditions in place, in theory, seeing a struggle as a cosmic war becomes a very real solution psychologically for making sense of the desperate conditions and finding hope in them.  The process of making an enemy into some version of Satan begins often with:<br /><br />1.  very *real* problems that become interpreted in terms of the whole world going awry.<br /><br />2.  Ordinary options for resolving the real problems simply aren't available to us.<br /><br />3.  We then begin the process of symbollizing the enemy as forces of evil, so that being part of a divine solution becomes part of our hope.<br /><br />4.  Coming back from the brink of desperation becomes possible by symbolic acts of power showing that the unwinnable war can be winnable in its cosmic form.<br /><br />I'm extracting the conclusions from a very detailed and thoughtful analysis.<br /><br />I think this analysis makes a very important contribution to our understanding of violence and terrorism but this book is also of great value for its framework for understanding the relationship of culture and individual action, and what it implies about how our institutions, practices, and discourse shape our thinking and behavior.

This serves as a ready and accessible reference, mainly because the topics  are extremely well chosen for both their timeless significance and their diversity, and the author does a very competent job of surveying most topics, in spite of their widely varying difficulty.<br />Technical scientific ideas are handled much less well than cultural and philosophical ones, so the focus of this book doesn't really reflect the modern emphasis on science and technology to the degree some might expect.  It does however do a good job of placing scientific ideas into broader cultural context.  For example, discussing the Uncertainty Principle, the author almost exclusively discusses the way it has been interpreted as having significance for the macroscopic world, rather than its significance for our understanding the microfabric of nature.  This accurately reflects the impact of the idea for most of us, but not its significance within physics.<br />The blessing of this book is its brevity, and it generally offers a small reasonably good choice of sources for followup on each topic.  The topics are not neccessarily treated even-handedly, since the author doesn't seem too hesitant to put his own spin on each topic, although they usually come close.  It is not an overly opinionated book considering how compressed the entries are.  At the very least, when a controversy is described over an idea, reasonable sources for the main protagonists are offered.<br />That brevity is also the curse of this book for those who may be fascinated by the samplings of ideas here, but not quite want to dive into the scholarly sources often offered as further reading.  It will also frustrate people very familiar with particular topics and disagreeing with what the author focuses on to make the entries concise.  That's what distinguishes this for me from an enclyclopedic treatment.<br />I would recommend this book as an excellent and exciting whirlwind tour of ideas and a painless way to learn broadly about philosophy and culture without having to read an encyclopedia, but it won't adequately replace either the original sources or the encyclopedia.this book for those who may be fascinated by the samplings of ideas here, but not quite want to dive into the scholarly sources often offered as further reading.

The Thomist tradition does not view faith and reason as being opposed, nor concede that faith is outside of reason, it views faith and reason as interlinked and interdependent, dealing with whole human beings as rational animals linked inextricably to each other.<br /><br />At the start, George makes the important point that his tradition is not founded essentially on revelation, mystical insight, or absolute authority, any more than any other tradition, and that such accusations are often levelled unfairly at Christian moral theorists.  His view is very similar to other erudite Thomists like Alasdair Macintyre (&quot;Whose Justice? Which Rationality?&quot;) who point out that the Enlightenment ideal of pure reason triumphing over human life was somewhat misguided.  In this regard, he also shares much with classical liberal theorists like Rawls and J. R. Saul, who emphasize the complex and multifaceted nature of human reason, very different from Voltaire's version.<br />Part of the great intellectual value of this book is that it implicitly makes a wonderful case for Macintyre's theory that human reasoning builds upon particular traditions, and the second generation cognitive science insight that people do not disagree simply because one reasons better, or from different assumptions.  This is the practical result of the fact that human reason is not strictly propositional logic.  Rather we reason from different ways of interpreting the meaning of events, through different systems of metaphors, different frames, different narratives, and different but overlapping ways of defining our core concepts.  The meaning of a clump of cells becomes very different when seen as something on the inevitable path to becoming a person.  It is this kind of penetrating clarity that George excels in, reflecting the orthodox religious viewpoint while (generally) not relying on religious dogma to make his arguments.<br />The main weakness here as I see it is that while George addresses the arguments of his opponents, the &quot;orthodoxy&quot; of progressives, and is admirably persuasive and temperate in tone, he does not seem to recognize any legitimacy to the progressive tradition.  He points out, I think rightly, that what is at stake is a clash of different orthodoxies rather than simply the triumph of reason over superstition.  But then he mischaracterizes his progressive tradition opponents essentially as lovers of death and haters of religion and spiritual values.  He awkwardly groups postmodernists, left-liberals, pragmatists, atheists, and religious liberals all together in a very uncomfortable unholy alliance against the Thomist tradition.  In so doing, he makes his own viewpoint more clear and coherent in contrast, but misses the enormous difference between the different progressive traditions he lumps together.  This often causes him to misattribute vaguely malicious motives or irrationality to progressive theorists.<br />The Enlightenment tradition of reasoning brought with it some enormously powerful new insights, but it also brought with it some dubious elements.  For example, I suspect we may increasingly find that Kant's concept of universal reason that can resolve any difference even in moral or ethical thinking is hopelessly flawed.  For a current example, see Mark Johnson's cognitive science critique of universal reason in &quot;Moral Imagination&quot; for a good description of the issues.  George argues that the orthodox Catholic tradition is &quot;more rational.&quot;<br />That is, he takes the additional step from first brilliantly legitimating the Catholic tradition of reasoning (in a somwehat more accessible way than Macintyre), to then attacking the rationality of progressive traditions as a whole, as if they are mutually exclusive and one must be entirely rational and the other irrational.  This is where he parts company with Macintyre, who instead for the Thomist tradition, but not on the basis of being more rational.<br />I tend to side more with Macintyre, that the orthodox and progressive traditions are both rational &quot;in general,&quot; but that doesn't necessarily make them equal (or even &quot;separate but equal&quot;) nor does it prevent us from having rational criteria for favoring one over the other in particular applications.<br />There may be perfectly good criteria for preferring to think of a person in one way in one situation and in another way in another situation.  In every tradition we make distinctions between the different application of principles in different circumstances.  George does a particularly good job exposing the particulars of how the modern Catholic tradition applies principles to circumstances, but then uses his own principles when he argues the opposing side.<br />That is, rather than reasoning from their perspective and then finding common criteria for evaluating the two lines of reasoning.<br />In conclusion, in &quot;Clash of Orthodoxies,&quot; Professor George does an exceptional job of explaining and arguing the orthodox Catholic moral tradition and how its principles apply to various central aspects of modern life and modern culture.  His arguments are clear and persuasive and, as promised, do not rely on revealed religion or mystical insight, although they occasionally lean somewhat on Papal decree.  He pays respect to classical liberal and humanist ideals, while attacking &quot;secular humanist&quot; versions and their so-called &quot;culture of death.&quot;  It would be difficult to find an equally lucid and compelling account of progressive moral theory applied in such a contemporary way, and this lack of good competition will perhaps be the greatest strength of this book in the long run.  I wish progressive moral theorists would use this book as their model to express their own view on the important issues of family, marriage, chidlraising, education, abortion, biotechnology, and so on, providing a good counterexample to George's strawman-based accusation that progressive theorists are all &quot;secular humanists&quot; who oppose stable human and spiritual values of all kinds.  He does not oppose them because of their lack of faith, but because he sees them as irrational.  Just as many of them see him.

US	53049224	R2RX4TTPOMSBSF	1568582935	452327165	On Equilibrium: Six Qualities of the New Humanism	Books	4	23	23	N	N	Much food for thought, but may also give some indigestion	\\"On Equlllibrium\\" follows in the tradition of Saul's earlier trilogy of philosophical works, extolling the classical humanist virtues and attacking various forms of modern corporatist rationale and systematic manipulations of human reason.<br />This book is like a very rich pastry, full of insights that bear savoring and re-savoring.  On the other hand, as Saul is very much aware, it does not lead to a very satisfying conclusion. In the end, it is the reflective balance between the various intentionally vaguely defined qualities that make us human tha Saul equates with essential human wisdom.  This sides the author with Rawls and a number of other progressive theorists who favor an uneasy dynamic balance over apparent certainties.  And consistent with his critique of pure reason in \\"Voltair's Bastards,\\" this leads him to poise classical Socratic doubt against reason and false certitude.<br />The incautious reader might well rush to accuse Saul of being irrationalist, and his sometimes murky style might reinforce that impression.  He is attacking \\"pure reason\\" in the sense of clear-cut trees of propositional logic, not human reasoning in the broader sense.  He is changing the emphasis regarding what it means to &lt;i>reason&lt;/i> from a dependence on logic ... to the reflective use of numerous natural abilities.  His main problem here is that he often accomplishes this in a relatively obscure and indirect way.<br />While it is not as difficult or confusingly complex as Voltaire's Bastards, and is somewhat better focused from the start, it still bears Saul's characteristic meandering (\\"reflective?\\") style and will annoy readers who prefer their philosophy to get to the point directly.<br />Saul deliberately avoids clear succinct definitions of his terms, even tentative definitions, and this makes reading this book somewhat like filling in a crossword puzzle.  You are never completely sure what he means by his central terms like \\"memory\\" or \\"reason\\" or \\"common sense\\" until you see them contrasted with each other in other chapters.  When you see all the other intersecting lines filled in, you can begin to guess at the missing word.<br />The result is a writing style that eventually rewards your patient efforts at reading and reflecting, but will probably fend off the less reflective reader very early on.<br />I recommend this book to fans of Saul, fans of difficult crossword puzzles, and others who enjoy rich, complex philosophical perspectives on human nature and human social interdependence.  It is not at all technical, but still a difficult book requiring some patience and even some re-reading at times.until you see them contrasted with each other in other chapters.

What are the building blocks of the mind, and how can they be implemented in a brain?<br />Interweaving the lessons of the two traditions of cognitive science (symbol processing and connectionist networks), Gary Marcus concludes that connectionist networks are the right approach, but that current designs are not adequate.<br />In particular, Marcus shows the limitations of back propagation algorothms and of multilayer perceptron networks that have no initial structure and must learn everything from experience.  This, he points out in the preface, has led others in the field to mistakenly assume he is anti-connectionist in general. This reveals the originality of his proposal. Rather than abandoning connectionism, Marcus proposes an original compromise, a growth path to a new kind of connnectionist network, one that can also act like a symbol processor.<br />For example, back propagation and similar learning algorithms used in current neural networks (multilayer perceptron models using multiple nodes to represent a variable) simply do not allow these networks to generalize abstract relations freely from experience the way biological brains are able to do in certain circumstances.  Marcus argues tht such free generalization is essential to human thought, yet a serious problem for current networks.<br />Another limitation of current networks is in robustly representing complex relations between bits of knowledge. A third key limitation of current neural net models identified by Marcus is that they are generally not able to keep track of individuals separately from kinds.<br />Marcus explores how these limitations of current connectionist networks affect a variety of real problems, such as linguistic inflection, language learning, object permanence, and object tracking. Some might ask, &quot;are these problems really so relevant to our understanding of ourselves?&quot;<br />Although these questions may seem technical, they are of vital interest if we are ever to actually build mechanical computational devices that emulate the human mind as well as the &quot;Positronic Brain&quot; on the Starship Enterprise.  As the produces of Star Trek would have it (by way of the late science fiction author Isaac Asimov) the mind is most realistically modelled as some sort of &quot;neural network&quot; which distinguishes it  from a &quot;traditional digital computer.&quot; But what's the difference?<br />At first, the distinction seems obvious. &quot;Neural networks&quot; in their current form are the result of a revolution in cognitive science known as PDP architectures, or parallel distributed processing. This architecture allows computation to occur in a highly distributed way among many parallel streams at the same time. This allows for a lot more different activity to be happening at the same time than an archictecture that forces logic to be performed in one (or a few) central places. If the operations of thought are highly parallelized in a mind, then this seems to provide a more efficient way to emulate it than a few programs running on a few CPUs.<br />This explains why we might imagine &quot;neural networks&quot; to be faster and more powerful at emulating the kinds of things a mind does than the way current desktop computers operate. Is this why, even in our science fiction, we think of &quot;neural networks&quot; as so much more likely to produce minds. Is it simply because they are faster? Is it because we are bored with serial computers and imagine that we need something more exotic to model the mind? What are the real issues that distinguish what a &quot;neural network&quot; can do from what a &quot;traditional digital computer&quot; can do? Can they do fundamentally different things? What would a neural network have to be able to do in order to act like a mind?<br />In-depth technical analyses of these important and fascinating questions (especially the last) are at the core of Gary Marcus' &quot;The Algebraic Mind.&quot; Although it is technical cognitive science, it will repay the effort for anyone seriously interested in models of the human mind. This book reveals the boundaries of our current knowledge of the mind by exploring the limits of the best approaches available and offering a path forward.t and fascinating questions (especially the last) are at the core of Gary Marcus' &quot;The Algebraic Mind.&quot; Although it is technical cognitive science, it will repay the effort for anyone seriously interested in models of the human mind.

I was suspicious of it because of the hype sent from the publisher, and the extremely broad topic covered for a science book, but it turns out that this is really good science writing.  Gary Marcus certainly knows his stuff and has a distinctive talent for making complex things crystal clear.  More, he has an infectious positive enthusiasm for scientific exploration.<br />With most popular science books about the human mind, the author tends to allow the material to be organized by their political and moral thinking.  By that I mean the way the author thinks about human reason, autonomy, free will, and the essential nature of humans in general.  So we most often have authors interpreting scientific data to show how the mind is: hardwired (or flexibly changing during our lives); highly specialized (or a general purpose problem-solver), built from adapted computational modules (or is essentially a useful artifact or &quot;spandrel&quot;).<br />Each of these different ways of selecting and interpreting the data reveals a different way of thinking about ourselves.  A hardwired, specialized, modular brain gives a very different way of thinking about ourselves than does an autonomous reasoning agent, and the implications for morality and for politics are profound.  While cognitive science and biology are our greatest allies in the physical understanding of the world, when we try to rely on science to understand ourselves, we have been forced to speculate and extrapolate from them heavily in trying to get an accurate picture of humanity.<br />I bring this up to illustrate why Gary Marcus' &quot;Birth of the Mind&quot; is such a notable book.  Somehow he manages to steer a course between the jagged rocks of innateness, the whirlpools of environmental determinism, and even the usual awkward compromises.  Marcus celebrates the triumph of interactionism (genes plus environments) not by simply claming it to be true but by explaining exactly what it means and what it tells us.  This is not a speculation about how genes and minds might be related; it is a carefully built skeleton of the conceptual bridge between the two.  &quot;Nature and Nurture&quot; are not waved away here but deeply engaged.  &quot;Nature&quot; here is not a collection of guesses about how we acted in the stone age and the challenges we faced in our evolutionary history, but an exposition of cellular biology and the way genes guide the construction of minds as a direct consequence of how they construct bodies.<br />This is a wonderful change from the polemics we find too often in books discussing research in genetics, evolution, and human behavior.  Marcus isn't entering into one side of the technical debates on human nature here as we find in much of the popular sociobiology literature and popular behavior genetics literature.  He isn't arguing about whether the mind is modular or whether it is a product of evolution.  Nor does he argue about whether we have a soul or free will.  As his title implies he is rightly more concerned about specifically HOW the mind arises, and this in itself hints at useful answers to the thornier questions.  The tone of this book is simply that of shedding much needed light on the entrance to a long path to growing scientific knowledge of ourselves. Marcus appreciates both what we know and what we don't yet know about the mind, and that's an extremely valuable quality for writing about such a complex topic.<br />The spirit here is similar to that of Matt Ridley's recent book on nature and nurture.  It is based on the emerging technical consensus that genes are central players in virtually all processes in living things, yet that genomes are not blueprints but self-regulating recipes.  A relatively tiny number of genes is able to guide the development of brains consisting of an enormous number of neurons, and miniscule changes in the genome can produce dramatic changes in theoutcome. Yet people with the identical genome have neither identical brains nor identical minds.<br />The solution to this dilemma is the centerpiece of the book, and it is answered by the way the genes work.  They act as recipes, but as self-regulating recipes.  This, Marcus explains, is the answer to the two great paradoxes of the mind: (1) a relatively small number of genes can reliably guide the self-construction of such complex multi-cellular organisms, and (2) the body is elaborately structured by genetic information yet still so flexible to environmental influences during development.<br />These are important and difficult questions that have great implications for our lives, so it is admirable that Marcus has addressed them without any obvious political axe to grind regarding human nature.<br />The book starts off introducing the hard questions: the surprising ratio of genes to cells, and the confusing mixture of stable and flexible developmental outcomes.<br />It then describes how we come out of the womb not with empty or fully formed minds, but as well-prepared learning machines with amazing and previously mostly unsuspected talents for observing and remembering in particular ways.  The distinction between a brain that is &quot;hardwired&quot; and one that is &quot;prewired&quot; is the next topic.  The brain has a definite structure, but one that is built for flexible change.  Even identical twins, who share exactly the same genes, have different brain structure.  When the crucial concept of the self-regulating genetic recipe is introduced, we see how the brain is built in exactly the same way as the rest of the body.<br />Next we see how genes guide the way neuronal connections are laid down: both how the brain is wired and how its structure is revised over time.<br />There is a single chapter focusing on human evolution, particularly on our capacity for language.  Language has long been the classic example of a &quot;modular&quot; ability, but Marcus takes a different slant here, genetic rather than sociobiological.  The evolutionary origin of language is used to show specifically how a small number of genes can have huge evolutionary consequences.n the outcome.

Deloria points out various of what he claims are widespread (yet supposedly hidden) assumptions of Western religion and Western science, and offers his own take on Native American folk wisdom and other traditions rather than natural selection as the universal acid that explains it all. His view is a hybrid of intelligent design creationism and catastrophism, where meaningful interventions and catastrophes reflect a spiritual dimension to nature.<br />Deloria shares the basic rhetorical strategy of ID, considering as a conceptual unit the biological theory of natural selection and the cultural values widely associated with evolution, such as the Victorian ideal of social progress.  This is part of the widespread assumptions that Deloria is criticizing.  It is this combined notion of \\"emergent change\\" Deloria seems to refer to when he talks about the \\"myth of evolution,\\" which often makes his view of evolution very different from Darwin's.  If this had been a 19th century treatise on cultural assumptions surrounding the acceptance of Darwin's theories, it would have some remarkable insights.  However, as a critique of biology and creationism in the 21st century it seems quaint at best.<br />It seems ironic to me that Deloria uses Native American tradition as if it were an argument against evolution (and seemingly against natural selection), because we would expect Native Americans to be great observers of details in nature and to be likely to find similar patterns in biogeography to the ones that captured Darwin's imagination on his voyage and which tell us much of what we know of the way living things change over time.<br />Was there something so unique about the voyage of the Beagle and the culture of Victorian England, or were there Native Americans who also envisioned that physical nature shaped the history of living things?  It would have made this book more interesting to me if Deloria had a better grasp on the biological concepts he is arguing against and had speculated a little more flexibly on the relationship of culture and scientific theory.  He argues a lot about how no one seems to really understand science, yet he presents Phillip Johnson's idiosyncratic view of evolutionary biology rather than that of evolutionary biologists!<br />If, as Deloria seems to imply, Native Americans generally didn't find the idea of evolution congenial, then why not?  Why was it so compelling in some cultures and not others?  If they did, then what is it about natural selection in particular that makes it so incompatible with creationist mythologies, while other forms of evolutionary theory are more compatible?<br />In order to address these kinds of questions seriously, Deloria would have to make the uncomfortable distinction between the specific mechanism of natural selection and the general concept of evolutionary change, as Michael Denton did in \\"Evolution: A Theory in Crisis.\\"  This is a tough thing to ask because it would require him to admit that natural selection itself makes sense and has massive evidence supporting it, and that the core issue is not whether it is true (\\"proven\\") or whether it is scientific but rather how much it can explain by itself.<br /><br />The basic concept of natural selection by itself doesn't explain for example where genetic or phenotypic variety comes from, the constraints on variety relevant to fitness, how heritable variation spreads in a population, what units selection acts upon, and what specifically benefits from natural selection.  The relationship between natural selection and the processes of development also provide rich technical considerations.<br />Rather than accurately being understood as details of the evolutionary process that are all raised as a result of the scientific explanatory power of natural selection, these things are treated by Deloria (as by other creationist authors) as \\"Criticisms of the theory of evolution\\" that supposedly strengthen some non-evolutionary alternative theory.<br />The central argument has little new to commend it, it is a minor variation of the usual form of reasoning you can glean from any previous intelligent design discussion: that (1) \\"evolution\\" is a widespread myth accepted for cultural reasons rather than on its scientific evidence, and (2) that the thoughts and actions of a supernatural or spiritual intelligence are more consistent with a meaningful coherent view of nature than the blind accumulation of random changes.  I didn't find Deloria's contribution to add anything to Johnson's or Dembski's, it shares their slant and their rhetorical definition of \\"evolution.\\"<br />That Deloria argues so similarly to the Christian ID authors yet from the Native American tradition is not an insignificant detail.  Unless you believe there is a conspiracy between all these folks, this offers some mild support for the contention that \\"intelligent design\\" is not just a fraud concocted by a few fundamentalist Christian authors, but is a pervasive alternate way of looking at nature, shared by multiple traditions.<br />This doesn't make the systematic misunderstandings of evolutionary theories and philosophy of science any easier to take or any more excusable for a scholar.  It does, however, help to appreciate that \\"creationism\\" isn't just some religious conspiracy against science.  If motive matters in coming to an understanding, then it is important to know that Deloria and the Christian ID authors may not simply be perpetrating a grand hoax, as some anti-ID authors seem to claim, but expressing a different tradition of reasoning.<br /><br />Deloria does voice some original philosophical ideas in places, but they still rely disappointingly on the standard intelligent design argument.  If you don't accept that argument as sound, Deloria comes off as annoyingly shrill in his implicit hostility to the rationalist and liberal aspects of Western culture, and not as insightful about its strengths and weaknesses as we might expect from a keen outside observer.<br />If on the other hand you're one of those folks who feels that the scientific worldview needs some sort of spiritual overhaul, you may find a kindred spirit here.ntific explanatory power of natural selection, these things are treated by Deloria (as by other creationist authors) as \\"Criticisms of the theory of evolution\\" that supposedly strengthen some non-evolutionary alternative theory.<br />The central argument has little new to commend it, it is a minor variation of the usual form of reasoning you can glean from any previous intelligent design discussion: that (1) \\"evolution\\" is a widespread myth accepted for cultural reasons rather than on its scientific evidence, and (2) that the thoughts and actions of a supernatural or spiritual intelligence are more consistent with a meaningful coherent view of nature than the blind accumulation of random changes.

Is it a fair and balanced treatment?  No, not at all.  This is a debunking treatment.<br />This book correctly places the intelligent design movement in its political and cultural context as an unfortunately successful attempt to discredit central elements of modern science ... in principle replacing the legitimate scientific tradition with a reformist theistic science as far as it succeeds.<br />Forrest and Gross do a superb job of showing why ID is not legitimate science according to the history and values that have driven science since its inception.<br />Yet in taking a scientific debunking approach and equating ID with \\"creationism\\" in general (and the \\"Scientific Creationism\\" of Henry Morris and Adventist literalism in particular) the authors also seem to miss some of the _non-scientific_ subtleties in their opponents' reasoning which make it as compelling and successful as it has been, even to many who aren't congenial to \\"Young Earth Creationism\\" and Seventh Day Adventism.<br />Forrest and Gross often discount rather than listening to their opponents, and in the process they often appear miss the internal logic and completely different way of thinking of the ID proponents.  This results in arguments that must genuinely sound ad hominem and question-begging to ID enthusiasts, accusing the ID authors of deliberate fraud and deception of various kinds.<br />The ID movement has deceptive aspects to it, but then so does the marketing of evolutionary theory in the popular press.  What Forrest and Gross do not consider, and should, is the extremely radical nature of the ID claims.  They treat ID as bad alternative science, seemingly because the IDers present it as an alternative scientific paradigm to evolutionary biology and natural selection.  They observe that it is neither conventional science nor speculative science ... concluding that it is therefore a fraud.<br />This doesn't quite seem to capture it.  Leaders of the ID movement often claim that science has been mistaken *from its inception* about rejecting a Creator of some sort.  In other words, they do not pretend to be doing naturalistic science and then sneak in a Creator, so much as they are claiming that science should have been theistic all along.<br />A Creator might possibly work through evolution, but with highly visible opponents like Richard Dawkins who often use natural selection as a reason to deny the existence of a Creator, IDers have little reason to split hairs between theistic and naturalistic evolution.  Their (often hidden) point is the designer, not the design.<br />An early hero of the ID revolution, Michael Denton (\\"Evolution: A Theory In Crisis\\"), has no argument at all with natural selection, only with its use as an all-encompassing explanation of form and function throughout living things.  His popularity among IDers reveals something important about the movement: their focus on making nature consistent with the presumed designer rather than worrying about the specific mechanisms used in design.<br />The rejection of Aristotelian purposes for all things was pretty clearly a positive step in the development of physical science, and this is a big part of what originally drove the rejection of teleology.  The ID folks are not entirely wrong in claiming that the rejection of a Creator itself was the somewhat arbitrary result of opposing the medieval Church's tradition in general along with Aristotle's pervasive teleology.  It was not a logical, empirical, or epistemic neccessity, but a cultural value associated with the Enlightenment faith in the autonomy of reason.  The core reasoning of the IDers is consistent and reasonable, given their assumptions, so the tone of Forrest and Gross will likely come off as shrill to their IDer opponents.<br />In the end, Forrest and Gross are surely right to be alarmed at this movement, even though it is probably more sincere than they credit it.  The problem with ID is not with its rather trivial observation of design in nature, but in the subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) reinterpretation of scientific data in light of scripture and an unspoken but shared vision of the Creator as an alternate way of reasoning in competition with the scientific tradition.<br />IDers do end up confusing the issue by claiming to be doing science (or \\"real science,\\") when in fact they are proposing \\"a new kind of science\\" rooted in theistic belief completely outside of the tradition to which we give that name.<br />Even if many scientists and philosophers were wrong to deny possibility of a Creator and the role of the Creator in natural events (something half of Americans seem to defend) Forrest and Gross are *still* right to be suspicious of a movement that borrows the name of the scientific tradition while seeking to reform it completely to reshape biology in completely non-evolutionary terms against the epistemic values and evidentiary basis of the field.<br />Forrest and Gross are not fooled by the superficial similarity and pretended association of ID with scientific reformers and fine-tuners of evolutionary theory.  They are at their best making it clear that scientific reform of biology and the non-science of intelligent design are two very different things.<br />This book is a splash of cold water to those who still may think of creationism in any form as something that belongs as a \\"theory\\" alongside biological science in a classroom.  ID is not alternative science, but an alternative *to* science, a part of a \\"culture war\\" to redefine the public symbols of truth and meaning.  Forrest and Gross provide the evidence of this, although in avoiding the internal logic of the opposing arguments and considering their opposition to be based mostly on fraud and ignorance, they don't seem to fully realize just how powerful their opposition's reasoning can be to many people.ugh it is probably more sincere than they credit it.

US	53049224	RDPFPHZF0WH27	0631189696	70948105	The Churchlands and their Critics	Books	5	34	36	N	N	Another instructive gem in a great series	This book is one of a half dozen or so in a superb series covering different contemporary philosophers and their critics in a single volume.  I find this format particularly instructive.  A dialog of philosophers and their critics  doesn't resolve their differences, but it does go a very long way toward clarifying those differences.  The philosophers covered by this series are particularly relevant to our understanding of the mind.  The philosophers covered in this series are those who have made very important contributions relevant across different domains of psychology, brain science, and philosophy of mind. Books in the series cover Dennett, Searle, Dretske, Fodor, Quine, and others.<br />For those like me who are interested in the boundary of brain science and philosophy *and* learn particularly well from dialogs rather than monologs, this back and forth with the Churchlands will be a real treat.  The Churchlands raise a number of central and fundamental issues relevant to our understanding of the human mind in their work.<br />This book contains essays presenting key criticisms of the Churchlands' influential and controversial approach to these issues.  The Churchlands respond to these criticisms in a measured way that clarifies the areas of agreement as well as the areas of difference.  For me, this book seems to stand by itself as a useful introduction to what is unique about the Churchlands' approach.  It is a hard read as a one volume introduction to their approach, but serves the purpose with some effort.<br />The issues covered explore the way the Churchlands' approach draws from and differs from other approaches in cognitive neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and neural network modelling, applied to explanations of moral theory, methodology, semantics, neurocomputation, and folk psychology.<br />Most of this book is readable by interested non-specialists, although some of the sections are more technical than others, particularly when the specifics of PDP models and the neurocomputational approach are addressed.  This difficulty is only found a a couple of the chapters.of PDP models and the neurocomputational approach are addressed.  This difficulty is only found a a couple of the chapters.	2004-01-30

It is packed with useful introductory and moderate level VB.NET information, presented in a systematic teaching format more than a reference format, although it seems to be a compromise of both.<br />I recommend considering this book as a combination introduction and one-volume reference to VB.NET for those who are going to be primarily using that language for their work on the Dot Net framework, and especially for those who already have some programming experience.  It covers programming basics well, but very concisely.  The basics of Web Services, Web Forms, and various kinds of applications are covered in a solid fundamental way with useful but simple examples.<br />I also recommend peeking inside first to be sure that you don't find the distinctive layout too distracting.  Their visually dramatic use of different colors and fonts (for example, they often use a larger font in addition to bolding, making the key terms jump out at you visually) makes it easier to find useful things quickly, but I think many people will find it tiresome when reading large portions of the book at once.<br />For those who find the layout too distracting but are impressed by the content and organization, another book in the same series, &quot;Visual Basic .NET for Experienced Programmers&quot; has much of the same content presented in a more subdued style more similar to most reference guides.<br />The book is a mixture of &quot;how to&quot; and textbook and contains a CD with code, and so will particularly appeal to those who want a strong formal background in the concepts but also want to get started immediately with programming.  This book builds on working code samples in an effective way so that you can apply the concepts as you learn about them.  This approach is obviously most fruitful if you already have the Visual Studio Dot Net installed and are ready to begin learning VB Dot Net.<br />This book is expensive but people who are reasonably comfortable with the way textbooks are organized will find this mixture of formal teaching and practical examples a very effective way to get involved in VB Dot Net programming and will refer back to this book frequently as a reference as well.  I do not recommend this book for people already moderately experienced with VB Dot Net, as they will probably not find enough useful content to justify the price, even though it would help them solidify their basic understanding of the language.begin learning VB Dot Net.  <br />This book is expensive but people who are reasonably comfortable with the way textbooks are organized will find this mixture of formal teaching and practical examples a very effective way to get involved in VB Dot Net programming and will refer back to this book frequently as a reference as well.

US	53049224	R2NOJVKU1RUQCT	0231103255	314577241	Adcult USA	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Advertising drives cultural evolution, so better enjoy it !	AdCult is about culture and advertising; both the culture of advertising and the influence of advertising on culture.  This is not something we see explored very often or very deeply.  As the author points out, one of the main reasons for this is similar to the reason dairy farmers tend to drink proportionately less milk than other groups.  We are so immersed in advertising that we stop thinking about it as a topic of study for its own sake.  It becomes just another object to sometimes attract our momentary attention, as when we stop to watch an award show treating advertisements as entertainment or when Saturday Night Live runs parodies of commercials.<br />Twitchell does take a close, inside look at culture of advertising and that in itself makes this book very valuable.  He also makes an argument about advertising and culture.  The unique memorability of advertising, acknowledges Twitchell, allows it to take on the function of shared cultural memory, and has therefore has inevitably replaced less memorable literature and science.  This is a valuable if unoriginal insight, which many of the old-fashioned types refer to as the \\"dumbing down\\" of culture.  But wait, there's more!  The twist in AdCult is that Twitchell, while admitting that advertising culture is mindless and superficial, compellingly argues that this \\"dumbing down\\" is really a good thing.<br />It's good that we are inundated with superficially memorable images and phrases rather than literature and science?  Yes, says Twitchell, and the old fogies who think otherwise just aren't getting it, they are mainly just feeling threatened by how advertising is \\"stealing their thunder.\\"  No, Twitchell is not some cyberpunk, he is (by profession) a university professor who did the research for this book in order to teach a class about advertising.<br />It's not that he never believed advertising was powerful, it was that he originally thought that power was a good thing, and then came to believe it was harmless anyway.  Twitchell was apparently very impressed by advertising critics of the 50's like Vance Packard and Bryan Wilson Key, and took home the message that if advertising was so powerful, the advertisers must be doing something right.  He later seems to have decided that advertising has lost most of its impact through constant immersion, familiarity, and increasing superficiality for ever wider appeal.  So now, there is no reason to despise this aspect of culture which has redefined the way we speak and what we desire.  Now it has become the source of our very substance, Twitchell argues, and bless it for that.<br />Twitchell characterizes pomo philosophers as intellectuals in a matter-of-fact way, while taking pains to point out how terribly quaint and old-fashioned are the culture critics who imagine there to be some basis for value in human life beyond what attracts our attention or feels good.  Ed Hirsch's populist attempt to foster cultural literacy is to Twitchell hopelessly \\"whitebread.\\"  There is nothing of special value in what we traditionally think of as literacy.  The main problem is that Hirsch's terms make hopelessly poor ad copy.  Rather, Hirsch should have used phrases from commercial jingles as his basis for cultural literacy, since that's what really defines our culture at this time in history.<br />Twitchell reminds me a lot of the anthropologist who got too close to her subjects and couldn't report on them objectively any more.  No, he doesn't see advertisers as kind, gentle, or noble savages. He accurately sees them accurately as promoting \\"commercial discourse\\" for a variety of self-interested reasons, including but not limited to trying to move products and create markets.<br />It is his view of culture that is wrong (or at least a collection of half-truths) and adopted from the twisted mindset of advertising culture.  Twitchell completely ignores (or disavows?) any relationship between culture and the capacity for human thought.  In the pomotradition, he treats human thought as if it springs in final from individual heads, connected to each other by whatever arbitrary superficial ideas happen to be floating around and catching our attention at the time.  In the advertising tradition descended from an idiot cousin of  Freudian theory, he fully buys the argument that people are instinctively aquisitive but need to be told what to acquire by others.<br />More subtly, Twitchell encourages the view that cultural literacy plays no role in facilitating complex human thinking processes, except that it makes ideas \\"memorable\\" and that advertising is good because it does this really well.  To discover why this view is wrong from a scientific perspective, a good start is Merlin Donald's \\"A Mind So Rare.\\"  Memory is certainly central to thinking, but literacy changed our minds in a very real and very fundamental way that is not independent of the content of culture, nor is it bound to Ed Hirsch's \\"whitebread\\" version of cultural literacy by means of key terms.<br />Put simply, humans are a symbolic species and the content of literate culture is part of what supplies the meaning of the symbols that enable us to think the way we do.  We know that people don't think completely differently as a result of different kinds of cultures or languages.  We can translate a great deal between cultures and still understand each other to a great extent.  However the content of culture does play a central role in what kind of ideas are generated and accumulated over time, and so the path of cultural evolution.<br />Twitchell's conclusion that AdCult is superficial mind candy, but good enough for shared meaning, and his assumption that social order is independent of the content of culture (or even improved by superficially memorable images) will probably pass most people by without much thought in this slick advertising-like presentation.  That powerfully supports half of the author's argument, that our minds do soak up slick memorable images like a sponge.

There is also a very real role for &lt;i>purpose&lt;/i> (or more specifically, purposiveness).  And the role of purposiveness has continued to increase over time.  Humans make particularly effective use of it.<br />The bad news is that our efforts to seek an underlying grand law or force that governs history or evolution may be fundamentally flawed.  We may be more responsible for our own survival than we have so far been willing to recognize. The true teleonomy (internal goal-directedness) inherent in Corning's view gives us both a creative and destructive role that is discounted in theories that rely on grand laws of history.<br />Corning refers to the various quests for an inherent mathematical law of evolution as \\"Neo-Pythagoreans\\" after the mystical cult surrounding the legendary mathematician.  He counts various well-known contomporary complexity theorists like John Holland and Stuart Kauffman and some physicists among them.<br />Corning doesn't see the world as necessarily a glorious self-maintaining Gaia, he sees it as a place where living things through their relations and interactions have come to have certain responsibility for their own fate.  This becomes an awesome burden once we apply this view to humans, where we take on the role of the Sorcerer's Apprentice in Goethe's (and Disney's) tale where the apprentice knows just enough magic to get himself into serious trouble.<br />The starting point is Arthur Koestler's insight that \\"true innovation occurs when things are put together for the first time that had been separate.\\"  Peter Corning takes this insight to heart and explores its remarkable implications, applying  this \\"astonishing capacity\\" to nature in general.<br />The essence of the argument is not that nature creates things that cannot be explained or things that cannot be understood, but that no grand laws of nature predict her fruits.  In effect, &lt;i>evolution is grounded in nature's astonishing capacity to create beyond what we foresee at every juncture.&lt;/i><br />Corning's theory of complexity in evolution is based on synergy, by which he simply and elegantly means the myriad effects of combining things where the result doesn't resemble what we'd expect simply by adding them together: the whole is different than the sum of the parts.<br />Corning's \\"Holistic Darwinism\\" is a way of viewing variety and selection in nature which is at once fully consistent with the neo-Darwinian synthesis and also provides theoretical bridges with the cybernetic theory of self-regulating systems and much of the body of scientific literature in social and political sciences.  Holistic Darwinism shifts the focus in natural selection from selection itself as a causal force to where the variety comes from.<br />Nature's Magic describes a very similar role for information in evolution as in John Maynard Smith's work \\"Major Transitions,\\" and Corning also makes particular use of Maynard Smith's concept of \\"synergistic selection.\\" If unrelated individuals are often locked into a shared reproductive fate with others, as Corning suggests, then it is reasonable to assume that they will evolve strategies for cooperation, not for \\"altruism\\" but in their own interest as part of a \\"collective survival enterprise.\\"<br />This shift in perspective in seeing evolution is an ambitious task for a single book, but at least the ground floor of the case is made extremely well here.  Nature's Magic persuades us that nature continually yields variety that is neither predictable nor random, but fundamentally &lt;u>economic&lt;/u> in its operation.  In other words, Holistic Darwinism sees nature as a great marketplace where the functional outcomes of new innovations are continually shaped by the consequences of their costs and benefits.<br />If combined effects in nature are really different in general than we would expect from simply putting things together, there are some unexpected implications.  For one thing, it implies that history matters.  If things combine in new ways to produce new features in nature that are not simply an extension of the laws governing the parts, then those new features can potentially have meaningful functional outcomes that play a role in natural selection.  This is the core of Corning's argument.<br />Corning boldly claims that Lamarck was right after all (in a sense).  Not that giraffes can create new genes by stretching their necks, but that they can create new ecological niches through their behavior that can later be reinforced by natural selection because of the successful outcomes of those new behaviors.  The logic of the \\"Baldwin Effect\\" thus figures prominently in Corning's Darwinism and gives an active role to organisms in evolution.<br />In a nutshell: \\"synergy\\" is combined effects all around us in various forms, it plays a causal role in differential reproductive fitness in a highly context-specific way, and it provides a scientific alternative to overreaching grand laws of history.<br />Instead of theorizing a vague new force or seeking a new law to help explain how natural selection can lead to biological complexity, Peter Corning supplies a fresh way of looking at the whole puzzle of complexity.  He does this by reversing the usual logic about cooperation in living things.  Rather than living things somehow cooperating to produce new outcomes through some unexplained form of 'altruism,' Corning sees 'nature's magic' of synergies underlying cooperation.<br />The clarity and scholarship of Corning's writing are extremely impressive, and he makes his case with a massive amount of data drawn from a wide variety of fields.  There is quite obviously decades worth of research behind this book and it covers a lot of ground and has links to a number of other theories in both economics and biology.<br />Because it is so lucid and well-written, I can recommend this fascinating book not only to academics interested in systems science, bioeconomics, and the philosophy of biology but also to those with no academic background in biology who want to keep up with what will most likely be a significant part of the future of biological science.ature are really different in general than we would expect from simply putting things together, there are some unexpected implications.

How can a book maintain a scientific tone while discussing things that so widely assumed to be incompatible with a scientific worldview, things like reading people's thoughts without using our five senses, or affecting physical matter with &quot;mind power?&quot;<br />There have been a small handful of treatments that have come close, such Ray Hyman's &quot;The Elusive Quarry&quot; on the mostly skeptical side, and Broughton's &quot;Parapsychology: The Controversial Science&quot; on the slightly less skeptical side.<br />When we pick up a book on science and the paranormal, the first thing we generally want to know is whether the author is arguing for the reality of anomalies or against them.  When it comes to a true scientific controversy, many of the best treatments are neccessarily the ones where you don't quite know which side is being argued because the facts are being presented as far as practical for you to evaluate.  That's a difficult posture to take in a book on scientific anomalies because the term itself is somewhat of an oxymoron to many people.<br />If it is an anomaly, how can it be scientific?  Isn't science supposed to be about things we can measure and &quot;prove?&quot;  Parapsychology relentlessly tests our attitude and philosophy toward how science works by presenting us with what are potentially very significant anomalies to the way we understand nature.<br />&quot;Psi Wars&quot; is a particularly good treatment of the general topic of the paranomal and its investigation by science.  It begins by showing clearly why putative psi phenomena are so threatening to our understanding, by virtue of their sheer bizarreness.  It then reviews the evidence for certain phenomena, such as telepathy, and shows it to be, (as parapsychologists have long contended, often against ridicule and accusations), remarkably strong.<br />A unique aspect of this book is that while reviewing the strength of the evidence for psi phenomena is an unusually balanced way, it also presents well-reasoned articles explaining why skepticism is still the most useful approach for scientists to take toward certain kinds of anomalies.  Standard statistical methods can show intrinsic weaknesses when used to analyze highly unusual results.  Scientific protocols have some unavoidable difficulties dealing with results that are so unreliably replicated in a laboratory.<br />This book stands out as an excellent case study of methdological issues of particularly difficult scientific investigations and a good way to examine tricky issues of philosophy of science.  Could it be that the phenomena are real and our understanding of nature has some disturbing holes in it, or could it be that our methods of understanding nature have limits yet to be fully recognized?<br />Psi Wars stands out for me as an unusually serious and responsible treatment of anomalous science in a field all to easy to dismiss or pass off as a joke.en against ridicule and accusations), remarkably strong.<br />A unique aspect of this book is that while reviewing the strength of the evidence for psi phenomena is an unusually balanced way, it also presents well-reasoned articles explaining why skepticism is still the most useful approach for scientists to take toward certain kinds of anomalies.

Well known for his award-winning _Genome_, Ridley is also the author of several other popularizations of biological science that are even better.  In _The_Origins of Virtue_, Ridley demonstrated brilliantly how &quot;economic&quot; factors like division of labor and trade are actually keys to understanding human social behavior, in spite of the fact that we are also the products of a specific biological legacy.  This is a deep insight that even many evolutionary biologists sometimes seem to stumble over.<br />As Ridley points out, the ideological question of whether human behavior is more the product of heredity or environment has distinguished not just scientists, but fascists and communists, just as surely as any of their political theories.  During the well-known sociobiology debates, technical issues were rarely discussed much less resolved.  Rather politics and the question of hidden agendas always raised its head.<br />While virtually all scientists and indeed anyone with a modicum of learning, observational skills, and common sense, have long known that heredity and environment were interacting factors in human nature, that answer truly satsifies almost no one.  We still argue over the many implications of being either victims of our genes, victims of our environment, or somehow free of both.  We still seek the answer to the technical question of *how* exactly biology and environment interact to produce living things, especially ourselves.  And more abstractly, we still want to know what defines us as individuals, and what determines our fate.  A lot seems to hinge on the answer, which is why asking the &quot;question of nature and nurture&quot; never fails to bring out strong opinions.<br />In the most common caricature, the hereditarians insist that we have a are products of our biological history and have a specific fixed nature rather than being blank slates formed by our environment.  The environmentalists insist that what nature wires up is a flexible general purpose organism capable of above all learning and being shaped by their environment.  In early political theory, the difference had serious implications because for example things like &quot;social contract theory&quot; revolved around what human beings were supposed to be like in a &quot;state of nature&quot; without society.  Were we gentle, peaceful, noble savages; or brutish, win-at-all-costs warmongers competing over territory and mates?<br />In _Nature_Via_Nurture_, Ridley freely exhibits both his consummate writing skills and his ability to make important scientific points clear without oversimplifying them.  His message is crystal clear.  Genes are everything.  Nothing about us, including our nurture, can be fully understood without appreciating the role that genes play both in constructing us and in providing ongoing biological functions.<br />But wait ... there's a catch.  A big one.  The hereditarians are right.  Our biological legacy is all important.  Yet the hereditarians typically understand or at least emphasize only part of the importance of genes.  The environmentalists made the serious mistake of fearing the role of genes because they, along with the hereditarians, assumed that genes were little dictators that caused things to happen.  &quot;Genetic determinism&quot; is supposedly something no one is silly enough to believe in, yet when the discussion gets heated, it seems to be the default position that nearly everyone takes.  In arguing anachronistically about &quot;free will&quot; vs. &quot;determinism,&quot; we instinctively place genes into the role of neccessity, regardless of which side we are on.  But it turns out that genes didn't cooperate with that characterization as we studied their role more closely.<br />This was also part of the underlying framework of biological science.  It was considered a classicmistake, so-called &quot;Lamarckism,&quot; to have fallen for the claim that behavior and experience could possibly influence our genes.  The influence was one-way, an assumption that was commonly assumed to apply in evolution, in development, and in behavior.<br />But there was an &quot;underground&quot; among biological theorists, long scattered and individually easily dismissed critiques which eventually have coalesced into a single powerful new interactionist framework.  Genes are indeed everything, but their influence goes both ways.  And this happens at all levels.  Not only are the chemical effects of genes influenced by the environment, but development is chanelled in various ways by experience, and the evidence is growing that behavior even has an influence on what happens in evolution.  Organisms actively modify, select, and construct their own niches, according to the preferences set largely by their genes, and this is an important factor in reproductive fitness, the selection criteria of biological fate.<br />And so the environmentalists are right also.  Experience and behavior do matter in shaping us.  Not just through learning and development but even through evolution.  And they matter not in spite of our genes, but because of them.  Still, this clearly doesn't make us blank slates.  Genes respond but they are not infinitely flexible responders.  The do set limits in some sense and they do establish reliable trajectories.  Yet they are not blueprints for our final form, nor do they compel our behavior.  Genes help build dynamic mechanisms capable of responding to the environment in particular ways to make it possible for living things to carve out their own way of life.  Here the hereditarians are right as well, having more &quot;instincts&quot; can make us more flexible rather than less flexible.  We needn't be a blank slate to be capable of flexible behavior or &quot;free will,&quot; we need the capacity to choose and some basis for making and acting on choices.<br />Just as he did for social behavior in _Origins of Virtue_, Matt Ridley sets a sane, clear, modern scientific tone for the next round of the neverending &quot;nature and nurture&quot; debate, and provides a bridge from the anachronistic abstract question of free will and determinism to the modern science that has the potential to address real answers to real questions.ered a classic mistake, so-called &quot;Lamarckism,&quot; to have fallen for the claim that behavior and experience could possibly influence our genes.

There have been several recent books capitalizing on the popularity of Brazilian Jujutsu (BJJ) such as those presenting basic techniques, a training syllabus, and self-defense applications.  This book is distinguished clearly from those by its more systematic coverage of the general principles and their origin, allowing more advanced martial artists of all styles to learn what makes Brazilian Jujutsu so effective under the submission fighting and &quot;no holds barred&quot; conditions where it excels.  This book also takes on unarmed fighting strategy in general, and so does not limit its coverage to the traditional methods of BJJ.<br />The book has several remarkable strengths, especially for a martial arts technical book.  It treats cultural evolution of martial arts in an unusually serious and competent manner, it is relatively free of stylistic bias despite being written from within the perspective of Brazilian Jujutsu, it is very well written, and it has a logical structure with clear, useful, well-chosen examples.<br />The book also has a couple of minor but notable problems.  First, the authors chose a completely non-scholarly format, and so they have some difficulty making serious historical and technical points with a very bare minimum of sources.  Second, the authors treat principles as if all principles were strategic, thus largely missing technical (e.g. biomechanical) principles.<br />Third, the authors avoid an important central issue, the classification of strategies based on the degree of risk and commitment.  An important distinction should be made between strategies that minimize the damage an opponent can do to us (&quot;minimax&quot;), and strategies that create the maximum opportunity to do damage to an opponent (&quot;maximax&quot;).  Without this distinction, Japanese Judo and Jujutsu seem to the authors to be 'without a systematic strategy,&quot; when in fact they have a consistent systematic strategy but it is based upon the Japanese aesthetic and strategic principle of the &quot;sudden death&quot; finish.  The goal is to use first opportunity to execute a devastating finishing move rather than to accumulate positional advantage in a series of phases.<br />The difference is one of the logical relation between preconditions and commitments in strategy.  Just as in chess strategy (e.g. see Vukovic, &quot;The Art of Attack in Chess&quot;, ch. 11) there are in general a set of preconditions that make a commitment to an attack sound, and missing those preconditions the attack is unsound and can be countered devastatingly by a skilled opponent.  Knowing the preconditions that will make the risk of a move worth taking is an extremely complex and error-prone matter that in most fighting strategies has to be done through experience and intuition.<br />Since an attack necessarily requires a commitment and therefore produces vulnerability, it is important at high levels of skill that the attack (finish or transitional move) be done when the necessary preconditions are in place rather than simply hoping to pull them off through speed and strength.  What the BJJ phased positional strategy does is to break down the preconditions for attack uniquely well and ensure that they are present.  A finish (or transition) doesn't begin until the advantage is present for it to succeed with a high degree of likelihood, unless a very clear target of opportunity opens up.  This way, BJJ fighters rarely get countered and frequently succeed at reaching the next step of their positional goal, especially against opponents who are waiting for larger openings to appear, even though they may have great technical skill.  This is what I think is the reality behind the &quot;lack of strategy&quot; of other grappling approaches.<br />This book does a very competent job placing the (strategic) principles of Jujutsu into Japanese socialand cultural context, using more than just the standard uncritical mythology usually found in books of this type.  The difficult topic of cultural evolution in general and martial arts evolution in particular is covered unusually well, although it stops well short of being a scholarly presentation.  The general problem of trying to explain both convergent and divergent evolutionary patterns in culture is introduced in an understandable way, and the weaknesses of the &quot;common origins&quot; theory of Asian martial arts are made very clear.<br />Having detached their analysis from the questionable &quot;common origins&quot; theory, the authors are able to make a strategic analysis of unarmed combat based on a more sophisticated combination of historical, social, and technical factors.  With this analysis, they accomplish something akin to what Bruce Lee and the Jeet Kune Do theorists attempted years ago, and what Paul Maslak addressed in his &quot;Strategy in Unarmed Combat&quot; and &quot;What the Masters Know,&quot; but with a new twist.  Whereas previous analyses focused on the range-dependence of standing fighting, the authors of &quot;Mastering Jujutsu&quot; add their understanding of mixed martial arts fighting.  This allows them to incorporate both the principles of grappling strategy and the principles involved in fighting against grapplers, and to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the of the range-based strategic approach.<br />They find the range-based approach marginally useful.  Where they consider range important to standing fighting is in the same sense that Maslak divided ranges into &quot;infighting and outfighting,&quot; and classical Budo considers a single critical distance or Ma-Ai to be important.  The JKD-inspired idea of separate ranges for &quot;kicking, punching, trapping, and grappling&quot; ranges is found to be an inferior teaching tool in a very persuasive analysis using both practical examples and general principles.  The authors divide standing ranges into &quot;non-contact&quot; and &quot;contact,&quot; and demonstrate why this is as useful a range-based analysis as can be attempted.<br />Where the book has its greatest value is in its clear and very general presentation of the origin and application of the phased positional strategy of BJJ, and the examples of how it is executed in mixed martial arts, submission, and self-protection fighting.  This is one of those rare books that while written from the perspective of one discipline has value that easily crosses disciplines.

US	53049224	R1GO078J064HQG	0670031860	846648040	Freedom Evolves	Books	5	66	72	N	N	Important clarifying work on a central philosophical issue	Although this book doesn't introduce anything radically new for those who follow Dennett, it does clarify his previous ideas on consciousness, free will, and human nature, and this<br />is far from a trivial matter.  For anyone seriously interested in the question of how human free will can possibly be compatible with physical laws of cause and effect, and thought that nothing else could be reasonably said on the matter, this book is an essential.  It will indeed help you clarify your thoughts, which is afterall one of the best things a work of philosophy can do for you, and one all too rarely accomplished by most philosophers.<br />For those who wonder about the conditions that foster human freedom and those that suppress it, this book doesn't quite delve into political or social philosophy per se, but it is at least a start at a real answer by providing clear thoughts and useful science and meta-science.<br />One very good reason for this book is that while Dan Dennett is a clear and vivid writer, particularly for a philosopher, he is also frequently rather badly misunderstood for some reason.<br />He has been described by reviewers as denying that human beings have free will or conscious awareness, and he has been accused of being an &quot;ultraDarwinist,&quot; although he himself disputes these claims.  In Freedom Evolves, he ties his previous ideas together and presents them in a way that will resist these misinterpretations of his ideas.<br /><br />First, Dennett defends the compatibilist tradition (where free will and determinism are considered compatible in principle).  He believes that the universe is probably deterministic in its physical nature, but that this doesn't mean our lives are pre-determined, nor does it prevent us from having forms of freedom worth working and fighting for.<br />This is done by distinguishing determinism clearly from inevitability with the help of his perspective tool of<br />different 'stances.' The 'stances' help see causation in different terms: mechanical causes from a physical stance vs.<br />functional causes from a design stance vs. the action of intentional agents from an intentional stance.  We perceive inevitability in causal models from the design stance.  Then we get confused between free will and determinism because we apply inevitability back to the physical, where it simply doesn't happen.<br />Then he builds a non-Cartesian account of choice and agency. Rather than distinguishing mind from mechanicals,<br />he describes different kinds of agency arising as the result of different raw materials available at different times and places.  He uses the &quot;toy model&quot; of Conrad's Game of Life as an intuition pump to show how the appearance of agency arises from Darwinian algorithms through patterns like anticipating and avoiding harm.<br />The fact that the game is implemented on a device that follows instructions to the letter makes it a tough sell I think, and not entirely convincing (something he is acutely aware of, but can't seem to do anything about).<br />The human kind of agency is introduced by a much clearer discussion of Libet's &quot;half second delay&quot; experiments than he provided in &quot;Consciousness Explained.&quot;  He makes the point much more directly here how the half second delay can reflect a distributed decision making process rather than demonstrating that &quot;we&quot; are not in charge of our own actions, as the interpretation sometimes goes.<br />He still follows the basic interpretation used by Tor Norretranders in &quot;User Illusion&quot; and Dan Wegner in<br />&quot;Illusion of Free Will,&quot; (which he has a lot to say about, mostly very good).  The fact that there is a reliable<br />readiness potential prior to reporting our decision to act does mean that in some sense &quot;I&quot; don't directly initiate my actions.  But Dennett further shows how we are shrinking this &quot;I&quot; too far when we use this argument to claim that &quot;we&quot; aren't in control or that a mysterious unconscious mind is in control.<br />&quot;We&quot; are able to disavow responsibility for our own actions under these contrived conditions because we break in<br />to the middle of the distributed process of decision making.  Libet's results demonstrate the separate operation of the parts comprising the whole process, and the flexibility of our sense of self, not the ultimate powerlessness of the &quot;I&quot;.  This discussion is a high point of the book.<br />In building a case for the power of the &quot;I&quot; to take responsibility and form committments, Dennett does a brief<br />review of the literature on evolutionary game theory and the role of committment problems in human social life.  He then makes his most important and final argument, that the capacities evolved to solve these problems have become the basis, through cultural evolution, of a fragile and socially and culturally nurtured and exercised ability to internallize reasons for behavior through reflecting on them and communicating them.<br />The idea that freedom, in the sense used in Dennett's final argument, is so real and yet so fragile is seen in the<br />way it can be heavily influenced simply by what we believe about it.  The metaphor of &quot;bootstrapping&quot; runs throughout<br />the book, having been introduced in terms of the children's story of Dumbo the elephant.  In some sense, we actually rely on useful illusions, such as the 'magic feather' that boosts Dumbo's confidence enough for him to try to fly.  A crow flies up to shatter the useful illusion by grabbing the feather away.  Dennett refers back to our frequent attempts to &quot;stop that crow !&quot; at various points in the book, pointing out where we may possibly be building real qbilities on the scaffolding of useful illusions, and trying to determine where the scaffolding can potentially be taken down once the real ability is in place.t;we&quot; aren't in control or that a mysterious unconscious mind is in control.  <br />&quot;We&quot; are able to disavow responsibility for our own actions under these contrived conditions because we break in <BR>to the middle of the distributed process of decision making.

Sciabarra finds some depth to Objectivism as a serious defense of &quot;libertarian&quot; ideals, worthy of more consideration than has typically been afforded the popular novellist and political theorist.<br />Sciabarra has to work hard to accomplish this task, and in the process resorts self-consciously to describing Rand's work in terms very different than she or most of her proponents would use.  The author clearly recognizes that this will quite predictably alienate Rand fans.  The book isn't neccessarily written, or most useful, for them.<br />By opening up the terminology a bit, and finding reasonably hypothesized general influences on Rand's life and thought, Sciabarra is able to reveal aspects of Objectivist reasoning and assumptions that those more familiar with other philosophers can now appreciate.  This is not a small matter, because the ideas are potentially very profound.<br />With Sciabarra's efforts, Objectivist ideas may begin to be placed more realistically in an intellectual and historical context, rather than being treated as an isolated phenomenon that began and ended with Ayn Rand.  Her work can be appreciated for its good ideas, as well as criticized for its potential mistakes.<br />This book is most fascinating for its unique and accessible description of the currents of often difficult Russian philosophy, its exposition of dialectic method, and its potential to translate Rand's own idiom into a form that can be compared with other philosophers in a clarifying way.  It is also, as far as I can tell, quite true to what I have always felt was the &quot;spirit&quot; of Objectivist thinking, the passionate and broadly inclusive defense of the individual mind.<br />At the same time, Sciabarra almost manages the extraordinarily difficult task of separating out Objectivism from the foundationalist tendency it instills in its most passionate adherents to certify itself as infallibly true.  Without that aura of insufferably dogmatic adherence, the ideas take on a new life.<br />One of the things that has traditionally left Rand scholarship out in the cold has been its isolationism from academic philosophy, an attitude that seems to be mutual.  Sciabarra makes a serious effort to bring Rand scholarship into academic respectability, and to me he does a very credible job.<br />This book has three sections dealing with (1) historical context in Russian and European philosophy showing what aspects of her Russian heritage she absorbed and what she vehemently rejected and giving some possible insight into why, (2) the structure and content of Objectivism in terms of realism, individualism, and libertarianism combined with a radical dialectical method, and (3) Rand's approach to social criticism, Rand as a &quot;Russian radical for capitalism.&quot;<br />I think it could easily be argued by both Rand critics and Rand proponents that this book is reading far more into Objectivism than it actually contains, but to me that is what made it so interesting.  It deals with the implications of the ideas themselves rather than the individuals involved and their own personal interpretations, and that is what makes for lasting philosophical significance.<br />I'd characterize this book as a thorough non-critical analysis by someone not specifically part of Objectivist thinking but interested in its potential value.  It serves as a very good translation guide to understanding Rand's ideas and their implications, but in many places it does not examine them quite as critically as I personally would have preferred.the extraordinarily difficult task of separating out Objectivism from the foundationalist tendency it instills in its most passionate adherents to certify itself as infallibly true.

A scholarly discussion of this book could well inform debates over the role of Darwinism in the modern world. It does however present a historical view that is very unorthodox in some ways.<br />It is a refreshing change to see this important side of Darwinism argued by its opponents rather than the tedious and unenlightening arguments somewhat more separately from the status of natural selection in science or arguments for the contamination of science texts, or the ill-conceived notion of \\"theistic science.\\"  It is the moral implications of a Darwinist view of the universe that seem to be at the core of anti-Darwinism, even though the rhetoric often revolves around the false claim that evolution is \\"a big lie.\\"<br />The confusion of the moral implications of a Darwinist view from the factual aspects of evolution are the biggest and most serious complaint from critics like Robert Pennock (\\"Tower of Babel\\"), and this book takes a welcome step toward that separation, although it doesn't quite achieve it.<br />This book at least focuses the core issues where they belong, in the realm of moral philosophy and how we should live as a result of our understanding of nature. It is also refreshing and ironic to see anti-Darwinism approached in a serious historical context, since Darwin's central point was to place the natural world into historical context.<br />The story here is well told, and correctly establishes the materialist philosophy going back to the ancient Greeks as part of the foundation of modernism later developed further by others. It is clearly an attractive story to opponents of the modernist worldview because it seems by this account to leave modernism rooted in an inferior basis of morality, something that the author finds Christianity to have done far better.<br />It also makes thoughtful points about the role of hedonistic philosophy in Western culture that are of interest to people who are not strictly anti-Darwinists.  It isn't hard to appreciate the role of hedonism today and sometimes feel as if we are, as Neil Postman put it, \\"Amusing Ourselves To Death.\\"<br />It is weakened in my perspective by failing to completely separate the factual evolutionary aspects of the modern worldview from their moral implications, and in avoiding the question of whether the roots of *democracy* and other aspects of modernism might also be rooted in those same times. The links between materialism, Darwinism and modern economic theory and their putative role in the Industrial revolution is an important issue that the authors largely avoid. If not from these aspects of modernism, where do they come from ?<br />Democracy is surely not an innovation by Augustine or Luther, it seems to me. Democratic ideals rooted in ancient Athens seem to play as much of a role in the modern world as Epicureanism, and there is a very serious question in my mind whether this aspect of modernity is being cast out along with Epicureanism and materialism by the author. The baby of modern freedom with the bathwater of modern materialist-Darwinist morality.<br />Some profound questions raised but not entirely answered to my satisfaction in this book and relevant to culture clash include:<br />1. Is Christianity, or some other doctrinal religion, therefore the only reasonable basis for morality in a modern Western world ?<br />2. Is moral humanism neccessarily always rooted in Epicureanism (or more importantly, Darwinism, for that matter), and is it the only alternative Christianity ?<br />3. Are there also negative aspects of the worldview of Christianity, or positives to the modernist materialist worldview that are worth preserving ?<br />4.

Phillip Johnson and Michael Denton share a lot of common ideas about the orthodox neo-Darwinist synthesis and its ostensible weaknesses.  Neither really rejects \\"evolution\\" outright.  Denton even has an excellent discussion of the evidence for natural selection in speciation, \\"microevolution\\" that even most Creationists no longer seem to doubt.  The problem is that they, and Johnson in particular, have no interest in enhancing science from this discussion, they are interested in retaining someplace for God to intervene in natural processes.<br />The association with Johnson and the ID movement unfortunately makes Denton's really excellent discussion here moot scientifically by making it sound as if Denton is a Creationist and that \\"evolution\\" ostensibly being \\"a theory in crisis\\" means that antievolution texts and disclaimers should be foisted on schools.<br />Denton is not a creationist, particularly not in this book (although in later work he seems to be a theistic evolutionist of sorts), and he makes some fascinating points here. Some of his points have been invalidated, but many of them are still valid.<br />Denton accepts natural selection as the primary mechanism of evolution and the only scientifically valid one, and accepts what Mayr calls \\"evolution as such\\" as pretty much a given here.  He notes that speciation has been clearly observed in various ways and that the fossil record is completely inconsistent with anything even vaguely resembling the literal Biblical view of Creation.  However, he has lots of issues with the assumption that all form and function in nature arises from a process of gradual incremental change.<br />The alignment of Denton with Johnson and the ID movement is mostly in Denton's primary focus on the puzzling conceptual break in the evolutionary view of nature, something ignored by most evolutionary theory and harped on endlessly by Creationists.  The break is between so-called \\"micro\\" and \\"macro\\" evolution, or what Denton exaggerates somewhat as Darwin's \\"special\\" and \\"general\\" theories of evolution.<br />The basic point is reasonable.  We do get a surprisingly different perspective  from observing evolution closely at a \\"micro\\" level, where changes in gene frequencies give rise to new species-typical features, and then looking at the pattern of phenotypes of higher orders in nature.  But what general conclusion about evolution does this lead us to ?  There's the rub.<br />Darwin's point was that the whole thing was part of a single set of natural mechanisms, and this point is driven home for recent general audiences by Richard Dawkins (whose radical anti-religionism makes him a good foil for the religious opponents of evolution as well).  Denton *correctly* points out that the patterns of nature are different from what a truly uniformitarian gradual branching of biological diversity would produce.  At least in theory.  So he points out that gradual change is essential to Darwinian theory (which is probably true) and then concludes that gradual change is not really the rule in nature, and so evolution needs a major overhaul.  His argument is nuanced and well made and it requires some sophistication in biological systematics to appreciate where it veers off track at some points.<br />Denton points out first that even given the scarcity of the fossil record, we still find fewer forms that are transitional between than we would expect from a random sampling, and the transitional forms that we do find are \\"less transitional\\" than we should expect from a gradual view of phenotypic change.  We see animals that have some organ systems of one taxon and some from another, we never find fossilsor species that have organ systems that really seem in some intermediate stage between the higher taxa.<br />The truly uniformitarian gradualist view emphasized by Darwin and underscored by Dawkins doesn't seem consistent with the actual organization of the main branches of biological life.<br />The discovery of speciational evolution explained much of this, and evolutionary developmental biology seems to explain the rest, at least potentially.  Features that support each other are often carried along together during evolutionary change.  Small populations can change very rapidly and are very unlikely to leave transitional fossils, giving the impression of sudden jumps in the fossil record.<br />Second, the Darwin-Dawkins strict uniform gradual view predicts that there should be an adaptive radiation of diversity that increases in distance over time.  On the contrary, what we find is that there were several major body plans that arose fairly early, and that we seem to have had no new ones over time.<br />Third, we don't find a continuum of genetic change between species, we see sharp discontinuities in mechanisms.<br />These points are not unique to Denton, of course.  Stephen Jay Gould made a career of pointing out the diversity of mechanisms that seemed to be at work in macroevolution and the need for a new evolutionary synthesis.  Wallace Arthur provides what may be the early basis for such a new synthesis in his writings on evolutionary developmental biology.  The problem of \\"macromutations\\" is no longer really relevant when you consider how developmental systems evolve.  We no longer need to rely on the assumption that new phenotypic features result from the mutation of individual genes. A tiny genetic change can be corrected by existing genetic mechanisms, or even cause meaningful and significant change in a developmental system without disrupting its existing function.<br />With the emergence of evo-devo and complexity theory to begin to help explain some of the patterns of form that were previously so puzzling, many of the issues raised in this book could be adopted for an introduction to the issues in evo-devo just as they have been adopted unfortunately to the arguments of Creationists.  In addition, this book serves as a nice bridge to help advanced biology students understand the anti-evolutionary arguments, stripped of religious elements.fossils or species that have organ systems that really seem in some intermediate stage between the higher taxa.<br />The truly uniformitarian gradualist view emphasized by Darwin and underscored by Dawkins doesn't seem consistent with the actual organization of the main branches of biological life.<br />The discovery of speciational evolution explained much of this, and evolutionary developmental biology seems to explain the rest, at least potentially.

The importance of reading is not just some archaic value, it sets the tone for education in general.<br />The way we engage written material does seem to me to be central to the kinds of questions we ask, and consequently the way we understand the material.  When I browse a tree of documents on a website, I often seem to come away with a very different understanding of the content than when I read the same material in a book.  Some of this may just be technological (taking margin notes is still difficult without a book, etc.).  I suspect that there may be more to it, because the way we tend to use the web medium makes attention-grabbing more important than the organization of the material.  We tend to organize web pages to keep our limited attention span engaged rather than to engage deep thinking about the material.<br />What we lose isn't obvious, because we tend to think of learning solely in terms of lists of facts.  However deep thinking requires that we more actively engage the material, ask questions, follow up, criticize the arguments, and so on.<br />If you have benefitted as much from reading as I have, you will have no trouble finding the author's view congenial in its stress on reading for understanding and interpretation, and also disturbing in its implications for the way we are changing the way we read.  At the very least, this book is itself very engaging and well-written and serves as a good example of why we should be taking the fundamentals and concepts of reading very seriously as new technologies begin to augment and replace it.	2002-11-16

It has become inescapable to see ourselves as having evolved for group living.  In \\"Origins of Virtue,\\" Matt Ridley described the overall situation admirably well, and concluded that selfish organisms can evolve mechanisms that exploit the advantages of living together in groups, so long as those mechanisms don't sacrifice too much for the individual.  The great fountain of selfish gene imagery, Richard Dawkins, once wrote that Ridley's book could well serve as a followup to \\"The Selfish Gene\\" as applied to human beings.  So there is little doubt that even a theory based on \\"selfish genes\\" can be seen as explaining behavior that takes advantage of living in groups.<br />David Sloane Wilson first acknowledges that traits which promote us to sacrifice ourselves \\"for the good of the group\\" are unlikely to spread in a population.  He find great value in fields like evolutionary psychology for finding innate human psychological traits that promote individual reproduction and survival.  However, he also takes a thought provoking look at important transitions in evolutionary history and finds that under certain special conditions, individuals become united and begin to function in a very real sense as a larger organism.  Genes become united into chromosomes, cells become organisms, organisms become hives.<br />None of this is new so far of course.  What is unique is the claim that some of these transitions cannot be explained without having some form of competition between groups whose traits are widely divergent.  The basic problem is that behavior that allows one group to fare better than another must also allow the individuals to survive and reproduce within their own group.  So self-sacrificing behavior that makes a group of berzerkers unbeatable in battle against other groups has a hard time taking root _within_ the group of berzerkers unless it also serves them there.  Wilson claims that the bias against seeing selection occurrring at multiple levels, especially by the way genetic fitness calculations are averaged, prevents most biologists from seeing \\"group selection\\" when it does occur.  He then proposes that the missing piece is human moral systems themselves, which provide mechanisms that lower the cost of behavior \\"for the group\\" in terms of individual fitness.<br />For example, social controls such as rewards and punishments are known to strongly foster cooperation even though cooperation is very fragile otherwise.  We have tended to see this either in terms of individual self-determination or entirely in terms of social pressure.  Wilson's view allows a middle ground, of innate traits which social controls can leverage powerfully to produce cooperation.  Wilson's main point is that such traits probably require a multi-level selection theory to explain.<br />Wilson uses scholarly study of religion from a variety of fields to illustrate how human behavior shows evidence of forming groups as adaptive units in the evolutionary sense.  This was an idea that was proposed by Darwin (thus \\"Darwin's Cathedral\\") and seen as fundamental by many social scientists, but was roundly rejected for the difficulties it brings into population models of evolution.  In addition, the recent critiques often brought to bear on social science sometimes tend to see social science concepts such as those of Emile Durkheim as something needing to be slashed and burned rather than just seen in a new light.  Wilson takes a new look at Durkheim's functionalist view of society and the various critiques of it, and finds plenty of archaic ideas, but also notes that the central theme of religion serving to unify human groups remains out of the ashes.<br />In Darwin's Cathedral, Wilson compares his view of religion as something that unifies human groups with the competing views of religion as a collection of arbitrary Gouldian \\"spandrels\\" or byproducts of evolution, the view that religion is a form of catchy imagination, and the Dawkinsian view that religious beliefs are mental parasites, and makes his case very well.  He is very careful in his analysis and pulls from a wide range of scholarly material to make his case that, provided we are very careful about how we measure Darwinian fitness and very careful not to look for group selection where behavior can be explained otherwise, we can explain aspects of human behavior that simply can't be explained in terms of inclusive fitness for the genes of our relatives or even by playing games of reciprocal altruism.<br />Wilson makes many of the same points as Pascal Boyer does in \\"Religion Explained,\\" but seems to tie things together more neatly with his theoretical framework.  Since he is not limiting himself to psychological adaptations that solely promote individual survival and reproduction, Wilson has the added flexibility to pose adaptations for punishment and reward that serve social ends, which makes for much more elegant and powerful theory that explains a wider range of phenomena such as the tendency of human beings to see themselves readily as members of groups, their willingness to punish defectors, the the joy most of us get out of finding that we've helped someone else.<br />The only problem with this book is that Wilson takes on too much of a task here for one slim volume.  The data on human religion is massive.  I'm reminded of Frazer's classic \\"Golden Bough\\" and how virtually no one has ever actually read it all the way through in its single highly condensed volume, much less the dozen or so volumes he originally wrote.  And yet he makes his point.  Wilson also makes his point, and then draws from the massive data but seems to suffer in trying to navigate it all.  He spends a lot of time looking at Calvinism from various angles for example.  Everything he reviews seems to help him support his theory of religion as adaptive and unifying, but there is so much more to look at that in the end it feels oddly incomplete.<br />This is wonderful interdisciplinary theoretical work that deserves much more followup than a single person can possibly give it.hat religious beliefs are mental parasites, and makes his case very well.

It tells a complex story of diverse research threads with sometimes contradictory conclusions, and it tells it incredibly well.  By the time you finish this book, you will have a much better idea how to realistically interpret for yourself the claims for the latest diet or latest exercise machine or weight loss pill or program.  You will have a much better idea what is &quot;in your genes&quot; and what is not, what you can attribute to &quot;slow metabolism&quot; and what you can't.  In bringing together all of this diverse research and telling its story so well, this book is a landmark in explaining what sorts of things we can control, and where we are spinning our wheels.<br />Not only is the story of obesity research interesting and relevant to all of us, but it is extremely difficult to get the whole picture.  Each article and each news story tends to cover what is novel or most fascinating about research, and the solution the author is promoting, and usually ignores the background and the consensus already formed.  The Hungry Gene covers all of the central lines of research: the modification of behavior, the influence of genes, the way the body regulates its own weight, the role of food industries and marketing, and makes each set of findings clear.  Equally important, the author makes it clear what we still don't know about human weight control.<br />There simply isn't any non-technical source to find out what is known about obesity, and the technical sources don't tell the story nearly so well, and they tend to be speciallized to a particular field.  The Hungry Gene brings it all together coherently.<br />An important and highly relevant education-in-a-book on a deeply interesting topic.  Hard to beat a bargain like that. It's rare to find a book that meets such a pressing need for scientific information in such a skillful way.	2002-10-28

It is built on biological science, but interpreted in a highly idiosyncratic way.  A definite page-turner, with a lot of scientific and some scholarly references, but how accurate is it?<br />This is a selective but often chillingly familiar guided tour through human history.  Bloom cleverly and casually crosses fields of study, sometimes metaphorically and sometimes making literal comparisons, and often being unclear as to which he intends.  The result is an intriguing mixture of science, historical interpretation, and science fiction.  The flavor is distinctly Darwinian, but with a twist.<br />\\"The Lucifer Principle\\" itself is a simple acknowledgement that in the natural world we take the bad with the good, often as the flip side of the good.  The same forces that promote cooperation also promote barbarity.<br />Bloom starts out with a vivid presentation of the Darwinian vision emphasizing the competition of vehicles for the benefit of their replicators, the \\"selfish gene\\" theme at its most lurid.  \\"Survival of the fittest\\" has its way.  At that point, Bloom introduces the twist.  He proposes something that sociologists latched on to, but which most evolutionary theorists of recent years have avoided like the plague.  He raises the spectre of the \\"superorganism.\\"<br /><br />The superorganism was once a popular theme of old structuralist anthropologists like Claude Levi-Strauss, who saw society as a complex machine driven with the help of a common cognitive structure of individuals in terms of certain themes.  Bloom's superorganism is a much more ambiguous blob, held together by \\"memes\\" which hook into our primitive drives.<br />The structuralists mostly saw the superorganism from the top-down, attempting to find patterns in culture that revealed its nature.  Bloom instead derives the superorganism from the bottom-up by showing how people who share culture tend to form alliances.  The alliances take on the direction given by the \\"memes\\" which exploit biological drives.<br /><br />The idea that groups of organisms can share a fate so closely that they live or die as a unit is something that evolutionary theorists backed off from because it seemed that the genetic self-interest of organisms would nearly always tend to overpower any tendency for traits to arise \\"for the good of the group.\\"  We might end up with traits that help us exploit living in groups, which Matt Ridley calls \\"groupishness\\" in contrast to<br />\\"selfishness,\\" but it is still genetic self-interest.<br /><br />Bloom departs from this mainstream view by making the argument that mechanisms for suicide have evolved for both cells (apoptosis, programmed cell death) and individual self-destruction.  These same things are explained in very different terms in mainstream evolutionary biology, as either artifacts of adaptations, or adaptations for one set of conditions that become maladaptive in other circumstances.<br /><br />Evolutionary theorists tend to avoid seeing self-destruction as adaptive.  The common theme, Bloom points out, is loss of connectivity with the group.  When neurons can't hook up during the wiring of a nervous system, they commit hara-kiri.  When humans can't hook up with each other, Bloom theorizes, they also tend to go off and remove themselves from the gene pool.  An intriguing possibility that make a new interpretation of \\"learned helplessness\\" and \\"stress\\" research.  This is perhaps Bloom's most interesting and potentially fruitful idea.  Bloom builds much better technically on the group selection aspects of his thinking in \\"The Global Brain.\\"<br />In \\"The Lucifer Principle,\\" he just introduces the idea of the superorganism and applies it to various selected historical events.<br />It is in explaining how individuals can be wired to self-destruct, that the concept of group selection is raised, entirely without fanfare.  The diseases we attribute to \\"stress\\" Bloom says are nothing of the kind, but diseases of disconnection from the superorganism.<br />The adaptive benefit would have to be to the superorganism rather than to the genes of the individual in order for Bloom's argument to work.  He doesn't mention how controversial this idea is in the book, probably avoided for rhetorical purposes.<br />Bloom is an entertaining writer who uses the most dramatic examples he can find to make his points well.  If there is a general weakness in his writing, it is that he often avoids confronting how exceptional some of his ideas are.<br />The Lucifer Principle uses alternating chapters cleverly to introduce fundamental biological themes like dominance hierarchies and recent extensions like memes, and at the same time bring in Bloom's \\"superorganism\\" and apply those themes in a novel way to groups rather than individuals.  So we frequently end up with huge groups of human beings compared dramatically in their behavior to individual animals.  We have superorganisms vying for their place in the pecking order, having a collective shift in perception, becoming bullies when they are frustrated.  All illustrated with selective and sometimes idiosyncratic historical accounts.<br /><br />All in all, it works very well as narrative, and introduces some novel ideas that could have profound implications.  If Bloom is right about \\"superorganisms\\" leveraging human primitive drives through bits of culture, the result doesn't look good for our species.  There is certainly a lot of food for thought here, especially if Blooms sometimes radical caricatures are taken for their larger lessons rather than as gospel.<br /><br />Bloom is particularly hard on Islam, not as people but as a culture, both for the success of its spread and the historical brutality of its adherents.  He makes the distinction<br />between extremists and the rest of us, to avoid stereotyping Muslims as violent fanatics, but also points out that it is the extremists than often  end up driving the bus.  Bloom also uses the \\"meme\\" concept very casually, and sometimes in conflicting ways, in order to simplify his explanation of culture and build on his main theme of superorganisms climbing the pecking order.<br />An anxiety-provoking and well-narrated book that I hope gets a lot of things wrong, but I fear might be all too accurate.

This book is so valuable because Dennett's participation in fundmental issues of cognitive science, evolutionary theory, and philosophy of mind have drawn comments from so many other leading intellectual figures.  By looking at what different authors think of Dennett's various distinct ideas in basic issues of philosophy of mind and evolution, it is possible to learn more about their own, and that seems to be part of what the editors intended to do.  That makes this examination of Dennett's ideas, and especially their influence outside of his field, a kind of rosetta stone for understanding many current issues in philosophy and biology.<br />For example, there is a chapter on the evolutionary psychologists' critique of social sciences, showing how it builds on Dennett's evolutionary cognitivism but strays from it at some points.  The contrast helps point out the strengths and weaknesses of both the evolutionary psychologists' and Dennett's views, as well as helping clarify what might remain of the foundations of social sciences once the smoke clears.  Similarly illuminating is the chapter on Dennett's participation in debates with Stephen Jay Gould over the search for adaptations in studying human evolution.<br />Dennett's ideas are presented very clearly in a way that non-specialists can appreciate, and the choice of authors who are experts in other fields (rather than solely philosophers)  works well in most cases, showing that ideas do matter, and that good philosophers sometimes do have an identifiable and positive impact on other areas of culture.	2002-10-15

So if it weren't for the political sensitivity of the topic regarding education, and the unavoidable and sometimes warranted guilt by association; \\"No Free Lunch\\" could be appreciated as really thought provoking philosophy. Popular philosophy, not professional philosophy. Bill Dembski is neither rigorous enough conceptually (especially regarding the views of his detractors) nor incomprehensibly dull enough to rank with most professional philosophers in my opinion. However Dembski does have a very interesting book here, even compared to his previous efforts.<br />This book is clearly, cleverly, and carefully done.  In typical popular accounts, the Darwinian view of change in populations is so often recruited in the service of \\"survival of the fittest\\" ideology and as a modern creation myth that the ID authors seem compelled to try to trash them all together to oppose the ideology and the myth as sources of spiritual meaninglessness. Dembski is mostly able to stick to his positive argument and not misrepresent biological concepts the way some ID folks seem to do, but he shares their sins of omission about the positive evidence for natural selection.<br />The attempt seems well-meaning, and the worldview behind it a feels much more comforting one than the cold reality of naturalism.  But we no longer have any reason to doubt that \\"microevolutionary\\" change in populations continues to occur to and beyond species boundaries.  Darwin's vision was not survival of the fittest, or even just mutation plus selection, it was variety and fecundity.<br /><br />Clearly the whole worldview here is tuned to see nature as having intelligence and giving our lives purpose from without, whereas the scientific worldview seems to leave purpose as something that we find from within.  An exercise left to the reader, possibly explaining why we have such trouble with it.<br />Dembski doesn't seem to outright reject the modern concept of species or the branching of phylogenies from few to many, nor even the role of adaptive fitness in selection, he focuses on the putative inability of selection alone to produce the kinds of patterns we see in natural history, and especially the information code of DNA. But at the same time, he avoids the positive evidence of selection when it is there.<br />This book doesn't really introduce any radically new ideas beyond Dembski's usual explanatory filter, and the book is spotted by hand waving dismissals of objections. Most glaring is his very cursory treatment of the complexity literature and his reliance on negative arguments when comparing his ideas to those of complexity theorists. His basic point that they don't explain life is certainly clear enough, but he never really fills it in, which is the whole point from their perspective.<br />There isn't much support given for the conclusion sometimes implied (though not stated outright) that Dembski's specified complexity argument precludes Darwinian descent with modification. Most of Dembski's points seem as if they could apply to an intelligent or theistic evolutionary process from few to many species through branching phylogenies as well as to one that is completely non-evolutionary.<br />Also, Dembski's dismissal of competing speculations like Kauffman's adaptive fitness landscapes is downright abrupt. It's almost as if he's saying that Kauffman admits to not knowing completely how selection works, and he (Dembski) is sure he knows, so Dembski wins by virtue of superior self-certainty.<br />Realistically, in areas where we don't have evidence to distinguish competing speculative theories, we have to rely on plausibility arguments.<br />Like most ID literature, this book sometimes points out legitimate gaps in our knowledge, some of which could just as well have been written by a very speculative theoretical Darwinist, but it fills the gaps in our knowledge of evolutionary process with the vague notion of intelligent design. Basically it's what's left when we have run out of other explanations. Which means you either have an intuition for what it means and you can fill in the details, or you can't.<br />The problem is that it makes the inference of design that we normally do in biology, reverse engineering using adaptation as a guide, impossible.  Instead, we are left to guess at how to infer biological design from \\"intelligence.\\"  And the non-optimal design of living species makes it clear that such an inaccurate view of biological design is doomed from the start.<br />The question becomes: \\"how far can you elucidate \\"purpose\\" or \\"design\\" or \\"plan\\" once you assume that is what is going on ?\\" A model that relies on analogy with human intelligence is problematic from the start, since we don't agree on how that works. We agree even less on how Divine intelligence would work. There's no definitive positive argument against the intelligence metaphor in general that I know of, but it just doesn't seem to work, and the concept of adaptation does work.<br />Stepping outside of nature when explanations get tough doesn't quite seem right.  I admire Dembski's cleverness in finding ways to keep the design argument alive, but it just doesn't work.  Natural selection is too powerful an idea to simply be shrugged off because the chemistry gets complex, and in the end specified complexity just ends up being a plausible-sounding mask to hide behind.evolutionary process with the vague notion of intelligent design.

Brown is extremely good at making complex things (like philosophy of science) much more understandable and at explaining things we too quickly assume  we are thinking about the same way (like politics) in a way that helps understanding as well.<br />Brown is remarkably fair to all sides in the often contentious debates over science, sometimes reminding me of that other excellent Canadian philosopher, Ian Hacking.  He satisfyingly plays both sociologists of science and \\"internalist\\" supporters of science against postmodern philosophers whom he (I think correctly) disqualifies as being largely irrelevant to serious debates because as often as not they are simply unfamiliar with the real content of the scientific theories they claim to be arbitrary cultural constructions.<br />The point stressed in this book is that the usual interpretation of the debate follows the sides defined in Gross and Levitt's \\"Higher Superstition:\\" the \\"academic left\\" opponents of science vs. the supporters of science, and that this is an understandable error in defining the real sides.<br /><br />As a supporter of science who is on the left and is an academic, Brown points out the fallacy of defining the sides that way, and also points out the too often ignored intentions of the sociologists of science to be _doing_ legitimate science, not attacking it.  He interprets the lesson of Alan Sokal's famous hoax as raising the flag of rational thought for both the political left and the political right, rather than pitting one against the other.<br />This book contains one of the very best general introductions to the philosophy of science, an excellent recap of the best arguments against extreme versions of social constructionism, and also a superb overview of the strengths and weaknesses of the textbook internalist view of science as the confirmation and refutation of hypotheses.  He makes the specific unique contributions of each philosopher of science particularly clear.<br />This wonderful and solid introduction to the issues is followed by an equally good introduction to the program of scientists who study science itself, \\"externally,\\" and how it differs from programs studying other objects.  Perhaps Brown's most useful contribution of all is identifying the difference between the \\"external\\"and \\"internal\\" programs as different perspectives on human belief, what causes people to accept and reject beliefs, rather than different ways of looking at realism and objectivity.  I was persuaded by his argument that the central difference is whether we see reasoning and evidence as strong causal forces in human belief, or whether we see other causal forces as primary.  It isn't difficult to find plenty of cases where theorists have to decide between different interpretations based on their subjective plausibility, and plenty of ways that reasoning from evidence goes astray.  The question becomes whether we can actually rely on reasoning without going astray, whether norms of objectivity themselves actually do lead to objective reasoning in some sense.<br />The book ends with an interesting discussion of the democratization of science that helpfully ties all of the themes together to the author's conclusion that epsitemology is inseparable from politics, that science does indeed work, that it relies on a diversity of theories competing with one another, and that we need better informed and intelligent voices promoting it.<br />I had one point of confusion about Brown's explanations, in an otherwise very clear book.  His explanation of \\"naturalism\\" didn't quite make sense to me.  Rather than just leaving it simply as a view of nature that precludes the supernatural, he adds some assumptions that seem to tie naturalism directly to positivism, seeing the norm of objectivity as not only essential to science but to naturalism in general, and the only and best way of gathering information about the world.<br />It seems to me that people can be naturalists in the philosophical sense and yet consider non-scientific ways of knowing to be valuable. Emotions, metaphor, and examples aren't specifically tools of science, but they are still part of the natural world and ways of gathering potentially useful information about it that can subsequently be introduced into science.  Regarding an \\"aesthetic understanding\\" of the world as being outside of the natural world doesn't quite make sense to me.  It isn't important to his argument however, and a minor quibble about an otherwise outstanding and well-written book.<br />Brown leaves no important consideration unconsidered in this original and valuable contribution to the literature on the study of science.e that precludes the supernatural, he adds some assumptions that seem to tie naturalism directly to positivism, seeing the norm of objectivity as not only essential to science but to naturalism in general, and the only and best way of gathering information about the world.  <br />It seems to me that people can be naturalists in the philosophical sense and yet consider non-scientific ways of knowing to be valuable.

Herein lies the clearest, simplest, and most persuasive discussion I've ever seen on the limits of Karl Popper's view of science, along with a sound introduction to the Bayesian probability theory requiring no more than high school algebra and a little persistence.<br />Much of this book will strike students of classical probability theory and philosophy of science as very counter-intuitive at first, but it is so well argued and so clear that I think most readers will begin to warm up to the Bayesian view at least to some degree by the time they finish the book.<br />The book starts out introducing one version of the traditional &quot;problem of induction&quot;: 'how can we be certain of a rule inferred from finite individual observations ?'  We then quickly discover why the usual solutions offered don't quite work in actual theory construction in practice.  Mainly, the usual solutions (generally based on the disconfirmation of hypotheses) don't address the way _auxilliary_ hypotheses help theories escape refutation, and how webs of evidence of different kinds often converge to help confirm theories.<br />It has been generally accepted by modern philosophers of science that useful scientific theories go well beyond the experimental data.  Hence they can technically not be &quot;proven&quot; in a logical sense, only considered increasingly more likely as their testable predictions are validated.<br />The Bayesian view is not based so much on a negative attitude toward objective confirmation of theories, as on the observation that classical methods which are the guardians of total objectivity, in fact violate that ideal constantly and in arbitrary ways.  The most objective methods, such as those of Fisher and Neyman and Pearson are credibly claimed to rely on personal judgement of likelihood at key points, rather than being the objective logical consequences generally assumed of them.<br />The Bayesian view starts off acknowledging that subjective assessment of likelihood is an important part of theory selection and construction, and makes it part of the philosophy of science.  The central point is that we have degrees of belief in theories, and that these degrees of belief adhere to probability calculus.<br />The power of scientific reasoning then results not from some elusive objective logic of discovery but because our innate inference abilities lead observation of evidence to beliefs that follow probability calculus, and hence our sense of increasing credibility tends to reflect greater likelihood of a theory making accurate predictions.  Although our inferences are not consistently Bayesian by any means, our own intuitions about what represents *correct* inductive reasoning _are_ Bayesian in nature.  So when we take pains to correct our inferences based on our own standards of tenability, our subjective assessments lead us to increasingly better theories.<br />Our beliefs can be measured as probabilities, and probabilities can be used to confirm theories.  Among other things, the Bayesian view uniquely predicts, in contrast to the classical view of Popper and statistician Fisher, that novel observations should have and do have special importance in theory construction.  The authors not only introduce probability calculus in simple algebraic terms and discuss its application to philosophy of science, but they also devote considerable time to exploring specific weaknesses of alternate views, and considerable time persuasively addressing the strongest criticisms of the Bayesian approach, such as that it is &quot;too subjective.&quot;  But the Bayesian philosophy of science is actually built on a powerful theory of inference and is itself &quot;unimpeachably objective&quot; because of its strict rules of consistency, even though its subject matter is subjective degrees of belief.<br />If you've ever wondered exactly what the Bayesian approach to probability is, and what it is supposed to offer science, or you've ever been dissatisfied with the traditional answers to the problem of induction, this book will be your welcome friend for a number of evenings.  It combines mathematical elegance and deftness with simple philosophical wisdom and deals convincingly with the controversial nature of its claims.y, even though its subject matter is subjective degrees of belief.<br />If you've ever wondered exactly what the Bayesian approach to probability is, and what it is supposed to offer science, or you've ever been dissatisfied with the traditional answers to the problem of induction, this book will be your welcome friend for a number of evenings.

This one covers many of its oddities, and others have dealt with its philosophy, but I find that none of them has really captured its peculiar nature in a satisfying way.  Critiques like this one seem to miss the potentially positive aspects of Objectivist thinking, or at least fail to empathize adequately in order to gain an understanding of them, and books by \\"followers\\" seem to systematically miss the point of the critiques.  The author's point is well made, however, in that this is a common situation for critics and supporters of other groups widely considered \\"cults.\\"<br />This book by Walker strikes me as a somewhat overly sensationalized case study in social behavior and the fallibility of human reason.  It does a good job hinting at the excesses and blind alleys in human thinking that can be driven by our need for certainty and rationalized by the assumption of the infallibility of pure reason.  Unortunately, the book does get a bit shrill in its attacks in places, and it avoids a factual or philosophical assessment of Objectivism, which I found disappointing because in moderation it might have lent some better balance to the book.<br />Overall, I found a bit too much demonization of the characters and exposure of their foibles, and not enough empathy for the thought processes of believers that could help the reader understand what makes the whole system so attractive to them.<br />The notion of \\"cult dynamics\\" is covered reasonably well, and applied fairly in many places but with too broad a brush in simply characterizing everything about Objectivism as \\"cultish.\\"<br />In spite of the various flaws here, I do agree with the author that the Ayn Rand \\"cult\\" is a fascinating and important case showing that the power of logic alone doesn't neccessarily immunize us from distorted thinking, because human reason is itself guided by our nature as social animals.<br />See also Greg Nyquist's \\"Ayn Rand Contra Human Nature\\" for a better philosophical assessment of the core ideas, and the spotty but sometimes useful \\"Philosophic Thought of Ayn Rand\\" by Douglas J.

Elgin offers some hope for understanding the roots of human knowledge by finding a difficult but satisfying middle path between impossible certainty and excessive relativism.<br />Elgin reviews the notion of &quot;foundationalism,&quot; the traditional philosophical search for a certain foundation for human knowledge, and like most modern philosophers finds it to have failed.<br />She then reviews the modern notion of knowledge arising from language games and the notion that it is socially constructed, and finds some redeeming value in that but also finds that we don't actually entirely work that way when we accumulate understanding of a topic, especially in science.<br />Her middle ground is a &quot;reflective equillibrium&quot; that we seem to come to by maximimizing the collective tenability of a set of beliefs.  We examine the implications of our own beliefs after ascribing some initially tenable beliefs, and we correct incorrect assumptions in an incremental process.  Because of this we don't have to assume foundational beliefs that must be absolutely accurate, and we don't have to assume that beliefs are purely relative to social groups.<br />Perhaps her most important and practical conclusion is that &quot;knowledge&quot; as we intuit the concept in terms of accumulating truths is not what we really gain from our experience as much as we gain &quot;understanding.&quot;  Her most interesting sections are where she argues effectively that emotion, metaphor, and other sources of understanding traditionally often excluded as knowledge are actually essential parts of human understanding.  They orient us by shifting patterns of attention and revealing what is salient in an example.  This potentially makes art and literature a source of understanding by giving epistemic access just as scientific experiments do.<br />The downside of Elgin's argument is that she doesn't tie it into science as well as I would have liked, such as showing why we find some beliefs initially tenable and not others, or how the process of reflective equillibrium can be distinguished by its neurological or psychological faculties from other kinds of process.  She also offers little in the way of empirical tests to distinguish her view from others (she addresses a specific critique of her idea by Stephen Stich, but not a test for resolving it).<br />As philosophy that is readable by the non-philosopher, this is very well done and gives me some hope that some sort of common-sense and even useful ideas do arise in academic philosophy from time to time that can have application to daily life.<br />While in retrospect there is little that is really revolutionary here, it is very satisfying to read something about human thinking that represents us as having a potential for rationality and well-founded beliefs as well as giving a possible way for different kinds of understanding to be reconciled.  This is a very sane and grounded epistemology as far as it goes, though I would have liked it to have been taken farther scientifically.oesn't tie it into science as well as I would have liked, such as showing why we find some beliefs initially tenable and not others, or how the process of reflective equillibrium can be distinguished by its neurological or psychological faculties from other kinds of process.

It very well developed and explained, thought-provoking, and remarkably persuasive, especially considering how counter-intuitive some of the concepts are.  Boyer makes a clear presentation of the most common and intuitive explanations for religious concepts and practices, and then offers his alternative for each point, with empirical support where available.<br />Boyer's book is one of the best examples of making good use of evolutionary thinking from the young science of evolutionary psychology and the proto-science of memetics to bring new insights to anthropological data.  His concepts become not just a way of explaining away \\"weird beliefs\\" but explanations for broad patterns in human belief in general.  Boyer applies a coherent evolutionary epistemology to human belief and especially to the concepts and practices we consider religion.<br />The result is fascinating speculation with a new perspective and a good foundation.  Since this is the kind of book that tries to explain why we believe what we believe, people starting with a different set of metaphysical assumptions will find it difficult to appreciate.  Just as skeptics are fun to read until they attack our own beliefs, people of one religion will probably find Boyer's explanations fit well to other religions, but not their own.  Such is life I suppose.  To what extent can the same kind of explanations apply to scientific theories?  Boyer addresses this by emphasizing that scientific ideas are very counter-intuitive and result from a lot of hard work to formulate and communicate them in specific ways, making them distinguishable from other kinds of concepts that arise more naturally.<br />Boyer argues that the domain we think of as religion is largely artifical. He believes that the experience of the numinous or special contact of certain individuals with supernatural agents cannot explain the widespread transmission of \\"religion\\" in culture.  However, neither is the transmission of culture or the appearance of beliefs in different cultures arbitrary.  Some concepts are passed on or reappear and others don't, and certain patterns emerge in every culture.  The concepts that take on special importance to human life, as diverse as they seem, actually share certain qualities in all cultures.<br />Looking carefully at the cognitive processes that produce concepts and make them likely to be remembered and passed on, religious ideas and practices, Boyer insists, must be a result of the same cognitive processes that are used in other contexts, rather than special ones for perceiving supernatural agents in a transcendental domain.<br />There is an important nuance here.  Some authors have argued from an evolutionary perspective that we have concepts for supernatural agents and perform behaviors relevant to those agents because of adaptive pressures specifically to perceive and act on \\"religious\\" forces of some sort.<br />Boyer turns this argument on its head and says that the kind of inference systems we evolved make certain concepts more salient than others, and make certain concepts more likely to be remembered and passed on, not necessarily because those concepts represent veridical things we adapted to, but because  of the way our inference systems work.  The common patterns in concepts reflect a common set of biases we all share because we share the same inference systems.<br />For example, Boyer says that we believe in spirits because they activate our inference systems for human agency and social exchange, and then are remembered and passed on because they make personally compelling explanations for what we observe.  We tend pick up the particular concepts from our parents and local culture which fit our general explanatory needs.  But what makes some concepts spread so much better than others?  That's the question that meme theorists try to address, and one of Boyer'sclever ideas is tying it back to evolutionary psychology.<br />Boyer's idea tying this all together is \\"aggregate relevance,\\" which says that concepts which activate more of our shared universal biological inference systems and activate more of our emotional response patterns will have a bias in being remembered and passed on, and will also be more likely to be<br />\\"rediscovered\\" from at different times and places.  So our evolved psychological adaptations in effect bias the transmission of memes.<br />Some interesting points:<br />(1) Boyer makes use of recent concepts from cognitive linguistics, such as the work of George Lakoff, to show how we categorize things in ways shaped by evolution.<br />(2) People have intuitions in certain general domains not primarily because they generalize from experience because of psychological adaptations (and therefore internal templates) for categorizing different things and drawing inferences from them.  The templates produce intuitions about things.  Violations of our templates are remembered better.<br />(3) The inferences we can draw about intentional agents are particularly rich, and apply to a wide variety of situations important to our daily life, so it is very natural for concepts about supernatural agents to fill our need to explain daily events, thoughts, and feelings, and especially misfortune.<br />(4) When we combine our moral intuitions with our rich inferences about agents allows agent to be thought of as *relevant* to morality, even though we don't seem to actually need the concept of a supernatural agent or exemplar to think and act morally.<br />(5) The relationship between coalition building, forming dominance hierarchies, and categorizing people is discussed. Inferences that we normally apply to species (such as essential hereditary qualities) are sometimes applied to groups of human beings instead, especially using easy-to-detect and hard-to-fake signs.<br />(6) Boyer sees fundamentalism as a result of our coalitional instincts, a reaction to defection from a coalition, and to the secular message that defection from the constraints of cultural rules can be accomplished at low cost.<br />(7) Boyer sees ritual as a way of exhibiting and testing social cooperation while providing a salient explanation for changes we observe in our own behavior.<br />(8) Boyer distinguishes the doctrinal version of concepts produced by guilds of literate specialists from the personal or local versions of the same concepts used by people everyday in their thinking.oyer's clever ideas is tying it back to evolutionary psychology.<br />Boyer's idea tying this all together is \\"aggregate relevance,\\" which says that concepts which activate more of our shared universal biological inference systems and activate more of our emotional response patterns will have a bias in being remembered and passed on, and will also be more likely to be<BR>\\"rediscovered\\" from at different times and places.

It has caught on with a lot of people outside of biological science, but biologists have been generally skeptical of it.  The problem has been that theories of memes did not take the characteristics of the host into consideration, and we have a strong sense from biological data that the host of transmitted information probably has to have some control over the processing of the information that they receive and transmit.  The notion that our obvious strong propensity for social imitation also allows memes to enter us almost without resistance, then control us to force us to spread them seems a bit much.<br />Aunger has formulated the meme theory in a way that resolves these problems.  He is very careful in his reasoning compared to other popular books on memes and cultural transmission.  He shows why cultural transmission is important, pulling from some of the same fascinating data as cultural selectionism researchers such as Boyd and Richerson.  Cultural transmission matters because culture doesn't track with environmental, ecological, or genetic patterns.  He then makes the crucial distinction for a true meme theory.  He distinguishes the idea of a replicator and a duplication mechanism, and builds a model of memes specifically as replicators.<br />Cultural selection theory holds that culture plays a role in biological evolution, but doesn't neccessarily consider bits of culture tobe composed of self-copying replicators.  The reason the distinction is important, Aunger makes clear, is that if they truly can be seen in that way, then they add an additional causal force for culture to take on a life of its own to transmit itself through us.  This is the causal force that other meme authors have taken for granted, and Aunger makes it explicit and potentially testable.<br />In building his model of memes, Aunger finds that the definition can and should be made more specific, as a kind of complex residing in the brain rather than an arbitrary collection of artifacts, behaviors, and ideas.  This model of memes gets around the problem of beliefs not being truly arbitrary by making it at least possible to connect the acceptance of memes back to our evolved computational engines as described by evolutionary psychologists.<br />This is a very rigorous and well-considered argument that finally takes real anthropological and biological data into consideration rather than simply making vague analogies of culture patterns to infection patterns of microbes, or providing a too-facile explanation for things we don't agree with (those guys were just infected by &quot;religion memes,&quot; but we're immunized from that.&quot;)<br />I think this book is a landmark in the literature of modelling the transmission of human culture, and if the empirical testing it suggests bears fruit, it may well change the way we view human belief in general and have significant implications to epistemology.<br />On the downside, while this book is non-technical, it is academic in tone and is unlikely to have the same popular appeal as Brodie's dramatic &quot;Virus of the Mind&quot; or Susan Blackmore's very provocative &quot;Meme Machine.&quot;  On the other hand, it heralds a potential start for a real science of memetics, addressing the truly important questions (such as &quot;do we have memes or do they have us ?&quot;) which those others books attempted to answer but assumed the answer from the start rather than framing the question in empirically testable terms and a more specific definition of a meme, potentially telling us how well memes act act as true replicators.br />In building his model of memes, Aunger finds that the definition can and should be made more specific, as a kind of complex residing in the brain rather than an arbitrary collection of artifacts, behaviors, and ideas.

Both men do make good points, and both seem to succomb to their own sense of exaggerated importance at times.<br />Ok, so I fell victim to mass hysteria and read this.  Although I have only a passing interest in cellular automata, I felt I had to read this because of all the hype around it recently.  Well, I'm not an expert in CA, but it seems like a nice encyclopedic text for those who are.  I found most of it boring.  It reminds me of those artificial intelligence texts that sound like they are going to reveal how machines can be made to think, only to find an encyclopedia of subroutines.<br />I think people who write books like this seem to confuse two different kinds of audiences: people who want to hear a lucid explanation of how something works, and people who want to read code.  This one is better oriented to the code readers.<br />From my perspective, this is not particularly interesting or new as philosophy of science, or &quot;a new kind of science&quot; as the title seems to imply.  It may seem a little unfair to blame Wolfram for the excessive expectations of readers, but then again he does seem to encourage the view that he is presenting something completely revolutionary.<br />The view here is a reasonable modern extension of the Turing-Church theorem, but applied to the natural world.  Wolfram demonstrates that cellular automata can often also be &quot;universal computers,&quot; so that simple algorithms applied over and over and over can not only yield patterns of great complexity, but most importantly, like Dan Dennett's similar view of Darwinian selection as a universal acid etching its way through natural design spaces, the process can solve real problems under the right conditions.<br />Natural processes can be at least largely described and explained by how they build themselves up through repetitive rules.  I thought Holland and Kauffman and the others had been demonstrating this for years, and it seems to me to make more sense to consider Wolfram's work another step in that program rather than something qualitatively different.  In contrast, Stuart Kauffman's &quot;Origins of Order&quot; gave a similarly encyclopedic view of his work, but while crediting the sources of the ideas and also providing a realistic perspective of what was unique to his work and where he was building on other peoples' work, and giving a sense of contrast.<br />Wolfram's computations are indeed a new concept of mathematical science compared to Descartes, Newton, Laplace, and Bernoulli.  These patterns build themselves up rather than winding down to entropy.  However it isn't new with Wolfram, it was new with Turing, Church, von Neumann, Ashby, and Weiner, among others, and developed into computational research programs by the entire Santa Fe Institute.<br />As an introduction to the computational view of nature, this book is very weak, since it doesn't give the intellectual foundation, just the author's view.<br />So long as you know what to expect, this is a useful text of cellular automata and a good addition to the &quot;new science,&quot; just don't buy it soley because of the hype around how utterly revolutionary it is supposed to be, or because of how Wolfram's personal brilliance has been emphasized, or I think you are likely to be disappointed with what this book really contains.<br />Books I prefer as introductions to &quot;the new kid of science&quot; of computation and pattern formation in nature include Phillip Ball's &quot;The Self-Made Tapestry,&quot; Holland's &quot;Hidden Order,&quot; and Waldrop's &quot;Complexity: The Emerging Science.&quot;on in nature include Phillip Ball's &quot;The Self-Made Tapestry,&quot; Holland's &quot;Hidden Order,&quot; and Waldrop's &quot;Complexity: The Emerging Science.&quot;	2002-06-11

The most important conclusion is that human nature is and should remain a fundamental mystery, and that our pretense at explaining it scientifically leads more to abuses than to useful knowledge.  While the tone and underlying values are strongly conservative, as befits a classical scholar, there is also an interesting blend of less conservative thinking when it comes to the consistent arguments against scientism applied to human beings.<br />The author spends a lot of time praising and applying the powers of human reason while criticizing the proliferation of &quot;false knowledge&quot; and most significantly, telling us where reason simply can't go. All of psychology and social sciences in  particular are on the bad list.<br /><br />The &quot;false knowledge&quot; the author attacks isn't limited to the usual suspects parodied by the skeptics; alien abductions, recovered memories, pseudoscience and popular baseless myth of various sorts.  It also includes any attempts to probe human nature using science and unravel the &quot;fundamental mystery&quot; of the human heart.<br />As a scholar of classical studies, the author represents the received Christian wisdom of sacred mysterianism, or mystery regarding the human soul, and plays it off against the hubris of modern science in daring to try to understand human nature.  He illustrates all sorts of foolish trends of thinking in modern culture that ignore the received wisdom a classicist is expected to respect.  People instead rely on fads in poorly based scientific research and nonsense dressed in scientific garb. Unfortunately, though, the author so throughly debunks anything resembling scientific psychology that if we relied on this book we would simply assume that there was no way to use science to study human beings.  As if we weren't part of nature at all. That's where the author's relentless logic begins to break down for me, and where he also breaks his rhythm and ironically pulls ideas from leftist critiques of science as well.<br />The book is filled with good common sense and clear thinking, but its fundamental arguments about human beings as a mystery can be confusing to someone who doesn't follow the way the conservative mind works.  In particular,  the author is convinced that scientific research can't tell us much about human nature, but never explains why; other than that he says is must be &quot;beyond the complexity horizon.&quot;  However, he never demonstrates how and why that must be so, he assumes it and reviews cases where the ideal of simplifying our understanding of human nature has led to horrendous abuses.  The argument falters here because we also see how simplifying our understanding of other aspects of nature have improved our lives dramatically through science.  The dividing line at human beings appears arbitrary.  For the author, science becomes scientism at times solely because it is science about human beings, rather than because it crosses some meaningful criterion in an accepted philosophy of science.<br />To follow the author's argument, I think you either must share the author's respect for the traditional view of impenetrable human nature and free will or you must somehow draw the same conclusion based on how much foolishness has been perpetuated in the name of scientific study of human beings.  It isn't that the author doesn't make the point well in this manner.  He does, and I was persuaded to agree that scientific hubris is more prevalent in psychology and social science than is real knowledge.  The problem I see with this is that it doesn't leave any room for a legitimate accumulation of scientific knowledge about human beings, the author assumes they will always be a mystery.  I don't think that case has been made, and to me it goes against the spirit of scientific inquiry.<br />In making his pointabout the mystery of human nature, the author cleverly and surprisingly shows intellectual flexibility and seems to pull a half a page from the less conservative philosophers and argues, in almost the manner of Stephen Jay Gould,  for a pluralistic view of human nature, rather than a traditional conservative one.  However, it is only human nature that is beyond science for some reason, and that seemingly as an irrevocable rule of life.  He doesn't agree with the pluralists in other areas, only in trying to understand human beings.<br />He may be right, of course, and he makes a good case for the dangerous foolishness that psychology and social sciences have often led us to.<br />This reader was left with two strong impressions from the book.  One impression is that modern psychology and social science have largely been based on ideals and trends rather than real accumulated knowledge.  The other impression is that there must be some way of identifying real knowledge about human beings when we come upon it, rather than treating ourselves as a sacred mystery, and that there must be some intermediate position between the abuses of scientism and the author's human mysterianism.t about the mystery of human nature, the author cleverly and surprisingly shows intellectual flexibility and seems to pull a half a page from the less conservative philosophers and argues, in almost the manner of Stephen Jay Gould,  for a pluralistic view of human nature, rather than a traditional conservative one.

Michael Behe looks for irreducible complexity in biochemistry and then satisfied that he has found it and that it cannot possibly be explained as arising from a previous forms over time, he concludes that this is a break in the naturalist paradigm.  Dembski does something very similar by trying to show that an information code such as DNA cannot have been derived from a previous form by natural means.  I find Phillip Johnson consistently frustrating to read because he seems to me to deliberately miss the points made by his opposition rather than engaging the issues.  I suppose this is an unavoidable result of the underlying mentality of insisting on making war on mainstream 20th century science and claiming triumphantly that it is now &quot;in decline.&quot;  Ratzsch takes a very similar approach to those others, but his points are often easier to appreciate.<br />From most ID theorists, we're left with a view that obviously helps at least a subset of people reconcile scientific findings a view of nature as divinely inspired or designed by a greater intelligence.<br />Most ID theorists also generally leave us with a view that most scientists and philosophers of science find unacceptable, because they believe it puts a foot in the door for older and less productive forms of metaphysics to again enter into scientific discussions.<br />Ratzsch takes a broader, and philosophically more interesting perspective on the pro-design side.  Rather than emphasizing the usual (mostly incorrect) points claimed to debunk Darwinism, he in effect argues more to the point that while supernaturalism has indeed been cast out of science; that viewing the universe as having an intelligent design is not neccessarily counter-productive to scientific progress.<br />Scientists and philosophers of science generally share an assumption from the most common interpretation of the influence of teh likes of Aristotle, Hume, and Darwin, and most interpretations of the history of science and technology. They assume that empirical observation and causal modelling once was polluted by less useful supernatural causal explanations, and effectively stopped scientific exploration in the most interesting and productive areas.  They assume that belief in causes outside of the self-contained natural world are either superstition, less scientifically productive, or at least less parsimonious than any form of supernatural belief, purpose in nature, or theory of divine intelligence could possibly be.<br />Ratzsch clearly and simply disputes these assumptions.  He pulls from Newton's theological leanings and those of other scientists to show how supernatural leanings can be a positive influence on scientific thinking.  Ratzsch takes the perspective here that if even Einstein believed that God does not play dice with the universe, then we can't deny that having a Designer in mind is part of even the origin of even purely naturalistic theories and causal models.<br />Some of his points were far more persuasive than others.  There are many things in this book I found to disagree with in his interpretations of history and principles of theory construction, too many to list in a brief review, and most probably an inevitable result of my having an unapologetic and unwavering naturalist viewpint toward science, at least in its methodologies.  However I did find this to be one of the most thought provoking ID books I've read so far.<br />I certainly agreed with the author in principle that the notion of seeing the world as designed should be judged based on the productivity of that model.  If indeed the universe was designed by some prior scheme rather than being an evolving result of contingency and natural laws, then seeing it as if were designed would yield additional insights.  Even if it weren't designed, looking at it that way is a natural kind of human thought process, as the author points out.<br />The place where I had to differ was that, consistent with methodological naturalism, it seems to me that we already tried the &quot;design&quot; model in the 19th century, and have since then discovered some insights that went way beyond it and have proven far more fruitful.<br />Ratzsch seems to argue that we didn't give the design model of nature a fair enough shake.  If our concept of design is based on human thought processes (design models based on other things, such as literal interpretation of Scripture do not seem particularly predictive to me), and our knowledge of human thought processes is increasing, then it could well be argued that perhaps an increasingly more sophisticated design model of nature could be fruitful in science.<br />The irony here is that most of our growing understanding of design in nature seems to be coming from science being done within the natural selection paradigm.  Building a more fruitful design model of nature from knowledge gleaned from Darwinian science is a wonderful paradox to consider, but quite honestly I don't think most people who want to see nature as &quot;designed&quot; are going to be this flexible in their thinking.  So ironically, in the places where I think Ratzsch is right, I think he opposes the agenda of most of the people who will most appreciate this book.<br />In the end, though Ratzsch certainly made me think here, I had to still feel that as painful is this has been to our sense of meaning, the most important and striking scientific insight we have ever made into our own nature is that we are the result of a remarkable but contingent process rather than the isolated and most revered creation of a loving deity and the center of the universe.  Consequently, seeing the universe as designed would only be as useful as a design metaphor would fruitfully produce new insights, and this seems not only as yet a case not proven, but downright unlikely.<br />Ratszsch does a very good job questioning why this should be so, even though I found it personally unconvincing, and I think naturalist methodology has actually been a positive contribution beyond the original design view that was mainstream when Darwin studied.tural laws, then seeing it as if were designed would yield additional insights.

US	53049224	R3EFO5SRLM9DKC	0226467236	295706945	The One Culture?: A Conversation about Science	Books	4	18	19	N	N	A confusing but very instructive break in the science wars	In the late 20th century we began to see a number of books and journal articles out of some academic disciplines that criticized the positivist approach to science and its claims to authority.  Many of these have been themselves brutally criticized with such characterizations as \\"fashionable nonsense,\\" \\"anti-science\\" and \\"higher superstition.\\"  This has been variously associated with such terms as \\"confused academic left,\\" postmodernist philosophy, and social constructionism.<br />At their most dramatic, the so-called wars seem to revolve around a core of scientists, such as Norm Levitt, Paul Gross, Alan Sokal, and Stephen Weinberg, and their reaction to the way science is being characterized by people outside their fields.  They present a largely united front in expressing that some pure and essential form of science and clear human reasoning is under siege from several fronts.<br />The opponents of the hardcore scientists are more varied and thus harder to characterize.  The most persuasive criticisms come from people who study science and scientists and publish in academic journals: historians of science, philosophers of science, and sociologists of science.  It is this sub-group of critics, and especially the people considered sociologists of science, that are the antagonists for the hardcore scientists in The One Culture.<br />_The One Culture_ is not (quite) another salvo in these wars, it is an uneasy and often difficult attempt at an open dialog between the sides.  Notably, the participants here don't even agree on whether there is a war going on, or if there is, whether it makes sense to be declaring a truce.  In spite of the confusion, a number of important concessions are declared and I learned an awful lot about the variety of perspectives on each side, and how fuzzy the boundaries between the sides really is.<br />It is quickly apparent from this book that the extremes often presented in popular accounts are not accurate.  The people studying science are not necessarily trying to undermine it, nor are they necessarily contributing to an unhealthy or unrealistic view of science.  It is a legitimate topic of academic study to observe scientific research and study the effects of various factors on its conduct and its results. Also, the scientists here are not necessarily trying to present science as a great bolt of Truth from Mt. Olympus, and recognize that there are social forces that do influence their work, at least when controversies arise.<br />At times, I got a real sense from this book that people were almost deliberately misinterpreting each other, but then would concede that they may not quite be representing their opponent fairly.  The result is ironically and strangely confusing. Reading these essays I felt like I wanted to accept one of the views as true and just be done with the whole thing.  It was confusing because the concessions made helped me realize that the sides were seeing things differently, and I think our<br />instinct is to want to choose a side to agree with.  Rather than feeling more certain about the importance of science education, and the tragic decline of scientific literacy, I began to consider some of its limits, and even the limits of critical thinking and scientific thinking in daily life problems.  In that sense, this is a mind-expanding book in some ways, if read deeply.<br />This is not the most exciting or immediately satisfying book about the so-called \\"Science Wars\\" because it it is structured as a serious attempt at a dialog rather than a pitched battle or clear presentation of any one perspective.  However it is one of the most educational books on the subject for the same reason.  You can actually begin to see areas of significant agreement between sociologists studying science and the scientists themselves, and consequently you begin to see the real areas of disagreement as well.<br />A Lesson About Language<br />One gem in this book is a remarkable essay by theoretical physicist David Mermin where he recalls his published arguments with sociologist of science Harry Collins over Collins' interpretation of the construction of the theory of relativity.  Although their debate was heated and even rancorous at times, Mermin eventually recognized that the two weren't saying anything radically different, they were making different assumptions about each others' motives, they were using language differently, they were emphasizing different aspects of the process of theory building, and they were looking at human belief from different perspectives.  Mermin ends the essay with a set of simple \\"lessons learned\\" from the debate:<br />1. Focus on the substance not on the assumed motives<br />2. Don't assume that people in other disciplines are using specialized terms in the same way or that they understand the nuances of your own disciplinary language<br />3. Don't assume that you have penetrated the nuances of the disciplinary language of another field just because it appears to be easy.<br />Many of the essays contain similar (seemingly obvious in retrospect, but often forgotten) insights into inter-disciplinary communication.  Several of the hardcore scientists represented here seem to concede that they gave some of the sociologists of science too little credit and misunderstood them, and several of the sociologists of science concede that they didn't clearly state that observations are \\"experiment bound\\" as well as \\"theory bound.\\"<br />The final lesson seems to be that the development of theories is neither arbitrary nor inevitably takes a single final form, and that theories come from a web of interlocking evidence rather than being decided by one or two critical experiments.  Sociologists of science care more about the social aspects of that process and scientists themselves care more about the conceptual aspects, but both, when pressed, admit to the central points made by the other side.  One of the remaining sticking points concerns education, whether science and critical thinking should be consistently in the forefront, or whether education should be more rounded.  In this sense, C.P. Snow's \\"Two Cultures\\" are still alive and well, even though they needn't fight over science.retical physicist David Mermin where he recalls his published arguments with sociologist of science Harry Collins over Collins' interpretation of the construction of the theory of relativity.

This book also does a somewhat better job explaining why evolutionary theory is useful in biology, rather than just stating the case.<br />It is a deplorable fact that history has made the teaching of evolutionary science a \\"separation of Church and State\\" issue, almost as if evolutionary science were inherently atheistic, or anti-relgious.  Some evolution writers have played right into this by linking their own anti-religious views to the defense of Darwin.  One of the wonderful things about this book is that it manages to defend evolutionary theory science without attacking religion or the basis of most people's religious beliefs.  This is far from an easy task, as many other authors have discovered.<br />Defending Evolution takes the confusions over evolution seriously rather than just discounting them as wrong, and patiently explains how biological science has resolved each of them.  That makes this a very helpful teachers' guide, rather than just another polemic about how science is being abused.<br />Most importantly, this book does not make the mistake made by many others, equating anti-evolutionism with religion and then going off on an anti-religion argument.  People have both religious and logical reasons for failing to understand concepts of evolutionary biology, and it is important not to lump then together, but to recognize the nuances.<br />Yes, in a sense, this book is \\"preaching to the choir\\" meaning that it will probably not itself be likely to go very far in convincing a hardcore anti-evolutionist that Darwin was right.  For example, it explains that eyes and wings do not have to simply appear in their current form to be useful, addressing a common creationist misconception, but it does not illustrate the process in a visual way, and so probably would be be very convincing.<br />As a previous review demonstrated, people who find \\"macroevolution\\" implausible, whether on religious or non-relgious grounds, will probably not be tempted to change their mind reading the excellent explanations in this book.  Big scientific ideas like natural selection that require inductive reasoning over a web of interlocking data are not going to suddenly make sense to someone opposed to them simply because they are explained patiently and logically.  However, this approach probably goes a lot farther than anything previously written on the subject, because it avoids many of the polemics, unites scientists and educators against anti-science, and avoids associating anti-science with religion.<br />This book is a treasure for teachers facing the challenge of basic education in evolutionary theory in today's cultural climate, and one of the few relatively positive things to come out of the political controversies over teaching evolution in the U.S..<br />I highly recommend that everyone who teaches biology at least read this book, and perhaps use it to help identify supplementary materials that will address important areas of confusion that this book identifies.nist that Darwin was right.

But all too briefly and too thinly demonstrated.  A really great idea that seems to have fizzled for some reason.<br />The basic idea is that engineering is commonly imagined (at least by people outside of engineering) to be a matter of systematically studying a problem and crafting a great solution.  The reality, as the author explains very well, is that engineering efforts viewed in retrospect are more like hypotheses or good guesses at solutions.  We craft something that works, and then see the weaknesses and learn from them for the next improvement.<br />The point is that improvements are not simply a matter of meeting new customer demands or adding new features, nor even just correcting avoidable mistakes.  Some corrections and improvements are neccessary because complex systems have aspects that really can't reasonably be predicted at design time.  The mistakes don't just arise because engineers are less than perfect, but are an intrinsic part of the process of human beings engineering complex designs in the real world.  There is rarely if ever even the potential for creating a flawless perfect design that anticipates all likely contingencies and second and third order causal effects of even simple changes.<br />Whether a &quot;zero defect&quot; mentality is helpful or not as an ideal, it doesn't reflect how engineering actually works, at least when complex systems are involved.  The reality of human engineering is that intermediate failures are an important part of the process.  Engineering methodology needs to take this into account, and make best use of it, or else lead engineers in a futile struggle for a perfect initial design and forever wonder why they fail.<br />Although the I think the idea is very solid, useful, and important, this book certainly lacks the depth it needed to make the point and would have made an excellent chapter in a more detailed book.  There are important issues raised here, but not answered, about how to improve the engineering process based on this insight into the role of failures.<br />As a companion to this, I recommend Dietrich Dorner's cognitive science account of the origin of planning failure in complex systems in &quot;The Logic of Failure.&quot;  Dorner explains in more detail, with the help of his problem situation simulation research, why consequences are so difficult to forsee and plan for.idea is very solid, useful, and important, this book certainly lacks the depth it needed to make the point and would have made an excellent chapter in a more detailed book.

We get a good, if very simplified, presentation of the evidence that entire species of living things have appeared and gone extinct over the eons.<br />Moore also reviews the reasons why Biblical scholars have different interpretations of Genesis.  Unfortunately, Moore never seems to fully appreciate why these modern lines of thought might not be convincing and might present a problem for a lot of people.<br />Between the lines you can sense the real frustration in this book, of science educators faced with the task of trying to teach to an audience relatively unaware of the tradition of causal models and scientific descriptions of the natural world, and better prepared to debate metaphysics than evaluate scientific theories.<br />Just as the transmission of heritable characteristics through reproduction requires a stable genome, the transmission of culture, whether it be scientific or religious in nature, requires a grounding of trust.  The message we get from Moore is that his audience can't even be assumed to trust him that a Biblical narrative has a wholly different character than a scientific decription, they have to see it for themselves.  And of course he doesn't trust his audience to even know that much.<br />Moore explains why each set of findings is better predicted by an evolutionary account than by the account in Genesis, even if it could be reconciled in some way with Genesis as an afterthought.  He is more sympathetic to \\"faith\\" than anti-religious authors like Richard Dawkins, but he doesn't give his audience much credit at all.<br />Many aren't ever going to be convinced to stop trying to reconcile Genesis with science in some sense.  There's an element of futility in some of Moore's arguments to take a view of faith as something useful and almost quaint.<br />We see how all sorts of predictions made by evolutionary theory were eventually validated by observations, and how the whole puzzle gradually has come together in the 20th century to eliminate nearly all the pieces that were missing in the 19th century when Darwin and Wallace first proposed a basic natural mechanism for natural selection.<br />Although it is all pretty much laid out here for them, I can't imagine that very many people who think it is their Christian duty to oppose evolutionary theory will be persuaded very far by this book to learn about evolutionary biology or let their children learn about it.  Not because it isn't persuasive logically, but because it doesn't really address their blindspots nor their concerns realistically.  It is sympathetic but not empathetic regarding relgious faith, it doesn't adequately address the nagging concern of creationists that naturalism regarding origins undermines morality.<br />Finally, the book doesn't go very far demonstrating what I think is the main *non-religious* conceptual sticking point of anti-evolutionists; how small variants can possibly accumulate in a meaningful way over time if nothing is guiding each act of selection.  It seems fairly common to hear creationists arguing that it is unlikely for random mutations to ever add up to useful variation in structure.  Clearly if we are to reach someone with that odd view of the process we have to find a way to describe to them in simple terms how the genome changes andhow changes in the genome relate to changes in phenotype.<br />The most powerful notion of all and the whole point of Darwin's theory is that selective survival of variants cause stable features of the environment to guide the process, even without a plan.  We can't expect someone to understand adaptation through natural selection if they are imagining that dinosaurs jumped off of cliffs until one finally achieved a useful mutation and sprouted wings and turned into a bird.  This is very close to the account implied by the recent movie \\"X-Men,\\" and I suspect that many consider this almost realistic.<br />Richard Dawkins is one of the most talented authors for describing the accumulation of tiny useful features, but Dawkins unfortunately is so hostile to religion that he is one of the least likely people to be read carefully by creationists, although he would be perhaps the most helpful for them conceptually if they sincerely want to understand the argument for adaptation through natural selection.<br />This is a good book, but if Moore had a more realistic understanding of the profound role of faith in the lives of most of Darwin's detractors and borrowed a few pages from Dawkins to illustrate the piecewise accumulation of features, it would have been even better.  The logical structure and explanations for understanding the evidence for evolution are a little easier to follow here than in Ken Miller's \\"Finding Darwin's God,\\" but that book does a better job addressing creationism more directly.<br />Of course, even with these changes, this still will not convince many of the \\"intelligent design\\" crowd about the importance of evolution in biology. Perhaps Pennock's recent book on \\"Intelligent Design Creationism and Its Critics\\" would be a good supplement as well, if it indeed still makes sense to argue 19th century creationism in 21st century biology classes in order to teach evolution.<br />I guess the best hope here is that this book might help redeem a few more of the uncertains in high school or undergrad biology who are motivated enough to read it as a supplement to the sketchy account in their texts.enome changes and how changes in the genome relate to changes in phenotype. <br />The most powerful notion of all and the whole point of Darwin's theory is that selective survival of variants cause stable features of the environment to guide the process, even without a plan.

This is something brand new to me and which caught me completely by<br />surprise--a biologically informed love story. One of those wonderful books<br />that takes useful, interesting intellectual ideas and makes them real and<br />palpable in people's lives. The book is filled with delightfully primal<br />themes voiced in a very modern idiom. It doesn't just tug at your emotions,<br />it tugs at them through your brain by weaving a nest of stories that<br />interlock and share meanings.<br />This is not biology in the old sense of simple \\"animal instincts\\" or even<br />just the recent sense of selfish genes and the mathematics of human<br />relationship games. It is also biology informed by our modern understanding<br />of how we create and transmit meaning through words. The roles of the \\"meme\\"<br />or fuzzy unit of culture, feature prominently as conceptual undercurrents<br />here. Then the author takes it way beyond being a unit of culture and<br />illustrates by her own masterful example how it is also an agent of human<br />transformation.<br />Many people talk about how human beings are linked by their stories, but in<br />Trine Erotic, the author demonstrates just how fundamental a mode of<br />communication the story can be. Her characters reveal the deep strategies<br />behind their feelings and behaviors, while trying to sort them out from their<br />excuses for their own behaviors.<br />Through her own storytelling, Alice Andrews seduces the reader into layer<br />after layer of change in their own understanding, all the while explaining<br />what she is doing. This is a relatively new and interesting form of<br />introspective art that both inspires and teaches.<br />Two problems ... we aren't used to art being quite so aware of its own role,<br />especially in scientific terms, and we usually aren't comfortable with women<br />consciously cutting through the haze of erotic games to see their own<br />relentless Darwinian logic. It's exciting and a bit disconcerting as well to<br />see female sexuality both revealed and unleashed in this light.<br />Andrews's female leads have the terrifying but exciting freedom we wish we had,<br />while still being immersed in misgivings of their own making, trying to sort<br />out complex webs of feeling and what it all means.<br />Not only did I find this book a delight, but I've put it on my list of books<br />to read when people want to learn about how themes of evolutionary biology<br />can be applied to real life.l to <BR>see female sexuality both revealed and unleashed in this light. <br />Andrews's female leads have the terrifying but exciting freedom we wish we had, <BR>while still being immersed in misgivings of their own making, trying to sort <BR>out complex webs of feeling and what it all means. <br />Not only did I find this book a delight, but I've put it on my list of books <BR>to read when people want to learn about how themes of evolutionary biology <BR>can be applied to real life.	2002-03-20

This seems to me to be one of the most, if not the most comprehensive treatment of the concepts of evolution ever written up to this point.<br />The downside of this comprehensive treatment is this book may be encyclopedic in places where it really doesn't need to be. Gould provides historical and intellectual background to issues in many places that don't neccessarily bolster his central theme on the structure of evolution.<br />This is very well-written of course, Gould seldom fails to accomplish that. But it also rambles into digressions and sidelines that distract from the structure Gould is trying to elucidate. There are long sections of punctuated gradualism and its treatment by the media that are interesting but don't seem important to the structure of evolution.<br />An abridged version of this book or a summary actually focusing on the structure of evolution would be extremely helpful. The encyclopedic nature of the book makes it all too easy to miss the important points in my opinion, and I do think his main points are very important.<br />In spite of its relatively minor flaws, I think this book is important because it may be the first book to bring together in one place the core concepts behind the many various disjoint scientific criticisms of orthodox neo-Darwinism (\\"ultraDarwinism\\") in a coherent way. Yet Gould does not throw the baby out with the bathwater. He does understand and explain well how theories of evolution lead to a spectacular vision of the majesty of life.<br />Gould's view of evolution is the very antithesis of the sterile view of Darwin held by evolution's opponents in terms of the meaningless acumulation of fortuitous accidents. In Gould's structure of evolution, accident and contingency play important role, but so do the underlying discernable natural laws and the constant shaping influence by the environment in myriad ways.  Gould's evolutionary vision is not a mechanical algorithm for constructing lumbering robots but a process of constant artistry over the canvas of time.<br />I think this book is of great value both for Gould's detractors and his fans, because it makes clear virtually all of the important conceptual sticking points between the various theories of evolution.<br />Perhaps there has to be a Darwinist ideology lying behind evolutionary science. It seems to be the ideology that most people argue about rather than the merits of specific scientfic theories. If so, I find that Gould's expansive view of selection, adaptation, and contingency avoids a great many of the ideological pitfalls that so often seem to befall fans of the \\"ultraDarwinist\\" view of nature as a battle of selfish genes.<br />One of the casualties of Gould's pluralistic evolutionary structure seems to be the abomination of: \\"survival of the fittest\\" implies \\"might makes right\\". If so, there is reason for even the cultural opponents of evolution to find value in this broad and comprehensive treatment of evolutionary themes.Yet Gould does not throw the baby out with the bathwater.

Not because it was difficult, it is actually very easy reading considering the depth of some of the topics covered.  I read it twice because after the first time I was amazed that things I thought I already knew about had become so much clearer in my mind, and I was wondering how he did it !<br />Brown cuts right to the most interesting aspects of each controversy in evolutionary theory, makes each side clear, and all the while places each controversy into larger perspective in a coherent narrative from the first page to the last.  It would be very difficult to read this book without coming away bubbling with ideas about it; which is a way the author describes Richard Dawkins' books; but I think it applies just as well to Brown.<br />I was particularly impressed with how the author managed to make his presentations of some very technical points so very clear without resorting to pedantry at any point, and at the same time gave a vivid picture of the personalities and their motivations without reducing them to charicatures or elevating them to icons.  The power of Andrew Brown's straightforward conversational writing is very misleading and sneaks up on you, he teaches a great deal here without you realizing you are being taught.<br />The journey here beings appropriately with the very thing that makes sociobiology most uncomfortable: the startling mathematical discovery that selfless behavior could in principle evolve through natural selection.  If even our lofty ideals are the product of an algorithmic process in nature, our view of ourselves is fundamentally tainted somehow, a conclusion of no small importance as Brown dramatizes with the tragic suicide of theorist George Price.  The important thing that Brown recognizes that many authors miss is that evolutionary theory doesn't tell us we are selfish, it tells us something much more horrible ... that even when we act selflessly it is a result of our animal nature, not a matter of transcending our animal nature.<br />There is an excellent presentation of the different sides of several important sociobiological controversies, and oen of the best discussions of memes and their implications that I've ever come across.<br />Most notably, Andrew Brown does not just point out where he disagrees with some of the ideas, but offers positive alternatives to persue that avoid the pitfalls.  He offers the Aquatic Ape theory as a perfect example of good adaptationist thinking whether it is true or not, and offers David Hull's excellent &quot;Science as a Process&quot; as a foundational text for a potential true science of memetics.<br />If you have any interest at all in the application of evolutionary theory to human beings, I think this book is required basic reading.  Another excellent choice covering much of the same territory in a different way is Kim Sterelny's &quot;Dawkins vs. Gould.&quot;  That gives a more technical coverage of the controversies for those who want better depth.  Also, for a more complete coverage of the personalities and early history of sociobiology, try &quot;Defenders of the Truth&quot; by Segerstrale.ranscending our animal nature.<br />There is an excellent presentation of the different sides of several important sociobiological controversies, and oen of the best discussions of memes and their implications that I've ever come across.<br />Most notably, Andrew Brown does not just point out where he disagrees with some of the ideas, but offers positive alternatives to persue that avoid the pitfalls.

However, at least taking stock of the different sides of an issue and the priorities they reflect helps us understand our own position better.<br />I appreciate that a previous reviewer found this book bascially a rehash of predictable left-wing arguments that reflect the author's politics.  It is interesting that this was the basis for such a terrible rating, since the author's predictable left-wing opinions actually are a very small part of the content and message of the book, and seem to serve more an example than anything else.  Presumably all that background information on each issue is viewed either as trivial or overly biased, and I didn't find either to be true.<br />Ironically, the fact that many people will have such a strong knee-jerk reaction to opinions that differ with their own is part of the rationale for the way the book is organized; to show how sometimes examining the disagreement itself is useful rather than just choosing a side because it coincides with our previous thinking.  Especially with such important and emotionally charged issues as these.	2002-01-24

This is a different kind of book altogether.  There is only a trace of &quot;debunking&quot; here, regarding a few of the authors' pet peeves, such as the overemphasis on self-esteem by many psychologists, the sexual abuse/memory recovery controversies, and the usefulness of clinical experience vs. statistical predictive models.  However, those are certainly not discussed sufficiently to get the book for that purpose.<br />This is also not a book on critical thinking, or one listing all the various ways thinking can go wrong.  There are much better books on those subjects as well.<br />This is specifically a book describing a certain type of yet poorly understood cognitive mechanisms that the Dawes feels is at the root of much of our irrational thinking.  He considers the theories that assume out emotion leads us astray, and decides that even within cold thinking processes devoid of strong emotion, there are tendencies toward irrationality.  He makes the point for example that most support of Nazi fascism was not motivated by rage so much as cold cognitive processes: a suppression of sympathetic emotion more than the expression of hatred.<br />Dawes defines irrationality is a very specific way, as self-contradictory thinking processes and conclusions.  He then points out that there are a number of easily demonstrated biases in human thinking, even when there is no strong emotions involved.<br />Dawes does not believe that we understand this very well yet, but his central culprit is our failure to make sufficient comparisons in our thinking.  He is quick to point out that this is not usually because there are too many choices to consider; that even when we only have two options, we often fail to consider the second one.  Dawes does not really offer much of a unifying explanation for cognitive irrationality biases, though he alludes to some of the theories very briefly.<br />What he does do is to point out that human thinking is fundamentally irrational by default in some ways, and he believes it can be corrected if we understand and pay attention to the comparisons we make in our thinking.<br />This book has technically solid explanations, good examples, and useful scientific content.  On the other hand, I found it a pretty dull book to read, it felt a little more like it should have been an informal version of a journal article on decision theory and heuristics than a book.for cognitive irrationality biases, though he alludes to some of the theories very briefly.<br />What he does do is to point out that human thinking is fundamentally irrational by default in some ways, and he believes it can be corrected if we understand and pay attention to the comparisons we make in our thinking.<br />This book has technically solid explanations, good examples, and useful scientific content.

It is certainly not just a credulous account, it does a very credible job of bringing some fascinating phenomena into the light.  But I had to lower my rating a bit because I also found it very weak in its reasoning, conclusions, and scholarship, in its seemingly implied rhetorical purpose of putting the best evidence into rational or even scientific perspective.<br />The author seriously researched the evidence, and once he concluded that there was reasonable evidence for *something real* behind of the more seemingly unlikely phenomena, he seems to have made up his mind that the believers were right and the skeptics were simply being unreasonable.  Clearly, this natural and very human leap of faith does not itself make this a balanced treatment, the author simply takes the side of the underdog, the psychic believer, and becomes a rational advocate in their behalf.<br />This is a reasonable thing to do, but the tone of the book misleads the reader into thinking this is a balanced treatment, or even a scientific one.<br />It is a very fair book in the sense that he considers the best evidence for things that seem impossible without rejecting them out of hand, which is laudable. But in doing so, he missed most of the important technical issues raised about each of the points of evidence.  It isn't any more &quot;open-minded&quot; to reject skeptical explanations and interpretations out of hand than to reject credulous ones.  The author takes a balanced tone, but does not produce a balanced treatment, indeed he sometimes bends over backwards to avoid seriously confronting the implications of the evidence he competently and clearly reviews.  Some of the explanations just don't work.  To his credit, he does point this out in places, but it doesn't make as strong an impression as the inference that the various &quot;impossible&quot; phenomena are actually real.  The subtlety is lost on the reader.<br />In particular, the author does a very credible job presenting the _evidence_ for anomalous phenomena.  I will agree with the other reviewers that far.  But where he fails is that his scholarship is virtually non-existent.  This may at first blush sound picky, but the reason this is an important criticism to the authors conclusions is that he takes almost no notice at all of the contextual factors in building theories for understanding the evidence.  The intellectual history of the theories is missing.  The evidence supposedly stands on its own, a very naive view of how science works.<br />In other words, his contribution here is to give us good evidence of something that really isn't all that hard to believe, that people have experienced and reported some seemingly inexplicable things.  He is right that people who reject such reports out of hand simply out of surface implausibility would be cynics rather than reasoned skeptics.  But he misses the nut ... because he doesn't review the whole issue of why one explanation is better than another.  He often makes an intuitive but unscientific leap from something like &quot;there is no way I can explain this experience&quot; to &quot;it must be a ghost !&quot;.<br />Evidence without context leaves us to simply apply arbitrarily selected theories, which is the greatest sin of weak parapsychology research.  Good evidence of anomalies of information and energy transfer is not neccessarily also evidence for ghosts, reincarnation, or other elaborate supernatural beliefs. That's where the missing scholarship would have strengthened this book's message tremendously, and helped the author be more fair to the &quot;debunkers&quot; he glibly dismisses.<br />Logically, the fact that information or energy can be transmitted in some way that is not explained by one model  obviously doesn't automatically mean that a spiritualist or supernatural model of similar anomalies is true.<br />One principle missed by the author provides an example.  Information acquired in one sense at one time in one way can and is easily transformed by the brain into a completely different sense and a completely different form, at another time, which is amazing but not supernatural.  People may detect illness in others by smell for example, and translate it to an &quot;aura.&quot;  Finding the diagnosis to be accurate wouldn't mean that the aura reading should be taken at face value as an electromagnetic reading of the spritual body.<br />Another similar case.  The author sometimes talks about &quot;mind&quot; influencing &quot;body,&quot; a scientific anachronism (since we now have evidence that is not reasonable disputable in neuroscience that the body embodies the mind).  The phenomena of &quot;mind over body,&quot; as remarkable as they can be, are more accurately considered phenomena of the body influencing itself in ways previously not known or not understood.  Viewing them as influence of a non-corporeal spirit on a corporeal body is almost certainly archaic, and certainly unscientific.  But the best evidence ?? The author does a very good job with the evidence, but misses the boat in the modes of explanation for that evidence, a subtle but crucial point for eventual understanding of the real phenomena behind the reported experiences.<br />I suppose I would give this book 4 stars if I weren't so disappointed by the missed opportunity here to do a really first rate job presenting the case for experimental parapsychology, which I think is often a worthwhile pursuit.  But because of the lack of cultural or scientific context for the ideas, I have to give it 3, for a very good discussion of reports of anomalies but a failure to make anything of them.  If we take this best evidence seriously , there are either more things in our natural world than we currently understand, or that there really is a supernatural world beyond our own.  But we still have no idea even how to tell the one possibility from the other, other than making a metaphysical assumption.

Donald dramatically uses the intricate demands of a face to face conversation to show the practical weaknesses in the laboratory view of short and long term memory.  The laboratory evidence that working memory is very limited is overwhelming, and has fed the modern philosophical trend toward viewing conscious awareness as an illusory result of the work of unconscious agents.<br />But things we do in daily life clearly require us to track things much more numerous and much longer than could possibly be accomplished by &quot;seven plus or minus two&quot; chunks, even with clever strategies for grouping things.  Donald uses this to argue that conscious processes are very real and not to be ignored, and do play a central role in human intelligence.<br />Donald unflinchingly takes on the likes of &quot;hardliners&quot; such as Dan Dennett who argue that there is no central &quot;meaner,&quot; no self, no little person in our heads observing the stream of consciousness in a Cartesian theater.  He points out that the drafts we generate in our minds are not at all arbitrary competitors for dominance, but are distinctly related to goals and expectations.  Most insightfully, he argues that discounting the role of conscious processes has dire implications for social and political philosophy and how we view human responsibility for our own actions.<br />In my view, Donald makes the excellent point for yet poorly understood intermediate term memory mechanisms very convincingly.  I was completely persuaded that this is something we need to study to understand human abilities, and that &quot;hardliners&quot; views have some weaknesses I hadn't considered seriously before.  He does make one rhetorical twist, though, that confused and sometimes annoyed me until I figured it out.  He argues convincingly that we should retain the ideas of executive  processes, goals, schema, and expectations, and how they influence thinking.  The mind is organized in a central and domain general way for many critical things, rather than being completly modular and the result of bottom-up processing by independent functional agents.<br />I bought his argument here from fairly early in this excellent book.  But then he also consistently equates this kind of organization with what other people call &quot;consciousness,&quot; without making it clear at first.  So you start wondering why he is calling all sorts of things &quot;conscious&quot; when clearly we<br />don't notice them !<br />Most strikingly, in reviewing the research on subliminal effects, he considers them conscious, even though they are seemingly by definition, not !  That is where I discovered that he is relating conscious processes to goal direction and selective attention, not to &quot;noticing.&quot;  &quot;Noticing&quot; per se actually has very little to do with anyghing in this book. This was a difficult conceptual turn for me, but may be a profound idea.  It preserves the idea of consciousness as the selective goal-oriented use of attention to organize the activity of the mind, but doesn't attempt to explain phenomenal awareness per se.  His idea of the substrate of consciousness is a neccessary but not sufficient basis for &quot;noticing.&quot;  The emphasis here is on how we select things to focus our resources on, rather than how phenomenal experience arises.  This shift of emphasis allows him to make short work of some of the paradoxical ideas of the hardliners, without trying to tackle the &quot;hard questions&quot; of consciousness directly.<br />In a way, Merlin Donald takes on the role toward the study of  the human mind that Gould, Lewontin, and Rose take toward the study of human evolution.  He tries valiantly to bring us back from what he sees as the brink of an awful and unwarranted reductionism.  The reductionism of mind to unconscious computation, he points out, threatens the very foundation of our political and economic ideas around freedom and individual responsibility.<br />Remarkably enough, I think his argument often succeeds.<br />One of the reasons his argument succeeds is that he makes a very clear distinction between limited consciousness and non-existent consciousness, a line that gets blurred by some philosophers in the process of trying to explain subjective experience in terms of neurons.<br />Donald describes the difference that makes a difference, that human beings can select their own goals and adjust their own priorities because their nervous system is patterned by a symbolic web of culture to form a distributed cognitive network.  Going directly against the modern trend of evolutionary psychology in explaining away awareness as an artifact of functional computational modules, the author argues that human minds do have one very important distinction from other primate minds, a unique additional capacity for consciousness that evolved from the unique conditions  of  human evolution.  The human mind is not, he suggests, simply the result f emergent qualities of an arbitrarily complex neural network.  That would be too glib an explanation, and wouldn't explain why sensory nets are aware and not motor nets.<br />This book seems to be a manifesto of sorts toward a new view of the mind that incorporates what we know about the self and goal-directed domain-independent behavior rather than explaining away these important aspects of human mental function.round freedom and individual responsibility.<br />Remarkably enough, I think his argument often succeeds.  <br />One of the reasons his argument succeeds is that he makes a very clear distinction between limited consciousness and non-existent consciousness, a line that gets blurred by some philosophers in the process of trying to explain subjective experience in terms of neurons.  <br />Donald describes the difference that makes a difference, that human beings can select their own goals and adjust their own priorities because their nervous system is patterned by a symbolic web of culture to form a distributed cognitive network.

This is a pretty good read, but nothing new. It is the same message Key has been pushing at us for half a century.  It seems as if the advertisers have become more sophisticted, while Key has only slightly refined his message.  Like many of the advertisers he criticizes, he actually uses mainly the tools of repetition and building on existing motives, rather than adding persuasive or novel content.<br />Key's books are always interesting and very provocative, and this one is no exception.  However it does not add much to the now somewhat tired theme.  The things he gets right are, well, pretty obvious by now.  Advertisers are willing and able to craft images that evoke primal emotions, through testimonial, social situations, and evocative imagery, and may do so in ways that are deceptive.  They certainly rely on this to transfer feelings to their product more than they rely on persuading us with a strong argument that we need the product.<br />The scientific basis of Key's ideas is legitimate.  Marcel's fascinating research years ago showed that things perceived but not noticed are processed to a remarkable degree semantically, priming subsequent behavior and interpretations without itself ever becoming conscious.  There's no reason in principle why this shouldn't happen just as well with figure and ground as it does with tachistoscopic images.  That's why Key felt he could compare the phalluses in ice cubes with the apocryphal stories about James Vicary's briefly flashed &quot;Eat Popcorn, Drink Coke&quot; messages that caused so much undeserved panic.  Neuroscience research has since confirmed that there is a distinct amygdalar response to emotionally evocative images that we aren't aware of seeing.<br />Ok, but big deal.  Artists and poets make a meager living at the same craft.  Finding subtle ways to evoke emotion.  What is special about Key's argument ?  Key's whole argument, when you strip off the annoyingly redundant social criticism, is simply that these unaware images and nonverbal embedded stories, since they are not made explicitly conscious, cause &quot;repressed&quot; feelings to be applied to advertisers' products.<br />The cognitive neuroscience version of Key's psychoanalytic story is that the images activate semantic and preprocessing nets that alter how we interpret the product we are reading about.  Key's argument, which may have some merit, can probably be summarized better by saying that since we don't know where the emotion is coming from, we may be more likely to associate it with the product rather than the evocative hidden imagery.  That's assuming the images are truly that evocative, that we can perceive them, and that we don't notice them.<br />It is also assuming that the emotion isn't simply misplaced to the person we are with rather than the product.  There's probably a good reason why teenage boys like to take their dates someplace that raises their heart rate rather than to the library.  Some of that excitement gets transferred to them. See Perry Buffington's amusing &quot;Cheap Psychological Tricks,&quot; and &quot;Cheap Psychological Tricks for Lovers&quot; for a realistic perspective with humor rather than paranoia.<br />I could be wrong, but I suspect that the thing advertisers do better is not hiding phalluses, it is inundating us with sheer repetition and using images that have cultural relevance.  The suggestion isn't stronger, it is just customized and given to us over and over through powerful mass media delivery syringes.<br />The mystique that Key has been cultivating for so many years is that particular images can be made so powerful that people can't resist them.  It's a direct analog to the myth of the all powerful hypnotist whose every suggestion can cause people to leap out of windows or strangle their cat.  Fifty years of psychology research tells us otherwise, that the context and expectations are far more important than presumed magical mesmeric powers of individual images and suggestions.  Yes we can make the individual images or suggestions more evocative, but only so much, and then the repetition and our expectations become more important.<br />Key's influence on culture is seen most dramatically in the fact that he was successfully able to nearly single-handedly commandeer the word &quot;subliminal&quot; from its original meaning of &quot;below threshold,&quot; to now being in common usage as &quot;pictures with hidden sexual imagery,&quot; and even just &quot;any message that we are unaware of.&quot;<br />The problem with Key's books is not that he is wrong, in spite of his alarmism he was probably more right than most people from the start.  The problem is that he stubbornly refuses to see anything but a narrow view of what is going on.  Like Freud, he convinced himself early in his career that all around him was sexual images, and now that's most of what he seems to see.  There are often more interesting things going on psychologically in the images crafted for us than just erotic imagery, and more ways it is used than just advertising.  Pratkanis and Aronson's &quot;Age of Propaganda&quot; makes a nice accompaniment to Key's books, helping to pull them back into some scientific perspective.l images and suggestions.

US	53049224	R18PXXZHXT8OM3	0231120087	320892981	How Brains Make Up Their Minds	Books	5	49	49	N	N	A small outstanding book packed with real insight	Walter Freeman packs a lot of his experience and knowledge of how the brain works in this fascinating little book.<br />Freeman's emphasis is a bit unique in that he focuses on the dynamics of how neurons communicate rather than on either the anatomy of the brain, or on either mental states or behavior.<br />By adopting this focus on neural dynamics, the author accomplishes some interesting things that other authors haven't been quite able to accomplish.  He comes up with a multi-step mathematical model of how neurons organize themselves in order to function as a mind.  His model is far more specific than most (such as the vague model in Susan Greenfield's &quot;Private Life of the Brain&quot; for example) and he links his model clearly and consistently to the pragmatist philosophy of mind.<br />The key to Freeman's unique approach is that he addresses from the outset the critical observation that makes hte &quot;mind-brain problem&quot; difficult.  He recognizes that most models of brain function fail to address how top-down function in the brain could possibly work.  How, in the classical model of brain function, can we have an expectancy that reliably alters basic perception, such as in hypnotic anesthesia and hallucinations ?<br />Materialist and cognitivist models of mind (in terms of simple flows of neural energy or information between neurons) simply have no way to explain why some behaviors should be &quot;voluntary&quot; and others &quot;involuntary,&quot; or how meaning is somehow created from symbol processing.  Representational models (which consider the brain to store &quot;images&quot; in some sense) still have some serious explanatory gaps.<br />If the brain simply links together sensory stimuli from the senses, and then somehow &quot;taps into memory&quot; to help interpret what we perceive, why should our initial perceptual gestalts themselves be altered by what we expect to perceive ?<br />The way attention and expectancy work - requires a different way to look at the brain, such as providing a continual staging process for awareness.  The point is made succinctly and eloquently by Freeman, although readers interested in mroe of the background to this will find John McCrone's &quot;Going Inside&quot; a great read as well.  Rather than discussing the background of this modern view of conscious awareness, Freeman links it to his own model of complex dynamics among populations of neurons and discusses various implications for philosophy of mind and brain.<br />Freeman's view is that consciousness is not itself a &quot;cause&quot; of neural effects, but a global linkage for smoothing chaotic fluctuations through interactions.  The author borrows from a definition by Thomas Aquinas to make a point of defining intentionality in biological terms as a frame for problem solving rather than the weaker sense of &quot;aboutness&quot; used by analytic philosophers.  He then builds a model of mind that uses chaotic attractor patterns to explain how we create meaning in individual brains by interacting usefully with the environment.<br />Walter Freeman is one of the scientists seriously trying to address such puzzling matters as _choice_, and how others can sometimes become aware of our own choices before we are, in both daily life and careful experiments.  A lot of Freud's speculations in his theory of the Unconscious mind were intended to address this, but theorists today are in a better position to do it more scientifically.  How can choice seemingly be &quot;unconscious&quot; and yet we have a very real sense of free will ?  Is it an illusion ?  Freeman makes a strong entry in the race to explain this in a way that works scientifically and yet explains what we actually experience.  I read this at about the same time as John Taylor's &quot;The Race for Consciousness,&quot; and found that it covers a lot of very similar ground, and often more elegantly.<br />While this book is surprisingly readable for having so much relevant technical detail in neuroscience and complexity maths, it will often frustrate readers who want to follow it in great detail unless they have some background in both neuroscience and nonlinear dynamics.  In spite of this, I give it my highest recommendation because I think anyone who reads it will learn something interesting about the brain and its relationship to the mind.so much relevant technical detail in neuroscience and complexity maths, it will often frustrate readers who want to follow it in great detail unless they have some background in both neuroscience and nonlinear dynamics.

They start out explicitly relying on the traditional objective realist position, and show how interaction of certain brain areas can lead us to lose our sense of boundaries in time and space.  Thus the authors theorize that ineffable mystical experience arises from inhibition of a brain region that is critical for maintaining our sense of boundaries in time and space.  The description is not very technical, but it is clear and should make sense to general readers without any background in neurology.  The authors use their own simple terms for brain areas and functions rather than using the more obscure jargon of neuroscience.  The excplanations work well up to a point.<br />There is another, weaker aspect to this book, which is the philosophical musings of the authors.  Somewhere in the middle of the book, they decide that there are only two positions to be taken, objective realism  and subjectivism.  They make the reasonable point (though without supporting it in the book) that current neuroscience research reveals human perception to be constructed to a great degree, rather than directly providing a literal reflection of nature.  This particular point is made in more detail by others, such as by Gerald Edelman in &quot;Bright Air, Brilliant Fire,&quot; also suitable for general readers, and by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson in their writings, as well as Walter Freeman in &quot;How Brains Make Up Their Minds.&quot;<br />Having made the point that objective realism is not an accurate way to think about how experience arises from the brain, and assuming that the only think left is subjectivism, he is forced to concede that &quot;neurological reality&quot; as he calls it, hs to reflect ontological reality.<br />That is, he jumps to the conclusion that since mystical experience reflects something _really happening_ in the brain, that there must be a 'reality' being perceived by mystics.  This may be true in some sense, but it is very confused and confusing thinking.<br />For one thing, the authors claim that hallucinations are distinguishable from mystical experience in that mystical experience seems much more real.  Yet hypnosis research not cited by the authors reveals that under some conditions hallucinations are as real as perceptions, and rely on the same brain areas, and that our bodies respond to them as if they were perceptions.  In other words, the authors seem to get even the neurology wrong when they discuss what they call the &quot;existential operator&quot; that assigns a sense of reality to experience.  Contrary to the claims of the authors, the brain can indeed produce a perfectly solid sense of reality, right down to the brain regions used for sensory perception, from products of imagination, through suggestion.  This weakens their conclusion that &quot;mystical experience is more real than hallucination&quot; considerably, though of course it does not completely negate it.<br />Secondly, the authors don't recognize that there are options besides metaphysical dualism and objective realism.  The fact that we perceive mystical union as if it were as real as sensory experience doesn't mean it has ontological reality.  There are also very credible alternate views such as pragmatism (Walter Freeman, in &quot;How Brains Make up their Minds,&quot;), embodied realism (Lakoff and Johnson in &quot;Philosophy in the Flesh&quot;), and &quot;relational consciousness&quot; (John Taylor in &quot;The Race for Consciousness&quot;).<br />These alternate views all allow for meaning to be constructed in the mind, such as through meaningful action on the environment, without making it either a delusion or an objective reality in itself.  Thus, mystical experience can be meaningful and we can have theories, about its signficance as an evolutionary adapatation for example, without making mystical experience ontologically equivalent to a table or a chair, or resorting to a dualism of &quot;objective realities.&quot;<br />The authors simply don't make the case they claim to make that mystical experience is 'objectively real' because it is 'neurologically real.'  However, they do an excellent job of describing their evidence for the neural mechansisms in very clear and simple terms for general readers.without making mystical experience ontologically equivalent to a table or a chair, or resorting to a dualism of &quot;objective realities.&quot;<br />The authors simply don't make the case they claim to make that mystical experience is 'objectively real' because it is 'neurologically real.'

I guess the best comparison I can think of off the top of my head is to Lewis Thomas' thought provoking &quot;Lives of a Cell,&quot; but with extremely current science.  This is particularly welcome in these days when we are being inundated with the pros and cons of genetics, the emphasis here is off of the genome itself and onto its role in constructing the cell and bringing life into being.<br />The cell is, to put it simply, the basic unit of life.  This beautifully written book investigates the principles of what science knows about the cell, and also their limits.  In so doing, it also investigates much of what we know about life.  While it gets very detailed at times, it is still quite readable by educated non-specialists.<br />&quot;Way of the Cell&quot; makes judicious and consistent use of current state of the art principles such as self-organization, self-assembly, and the dynamics of far from equillibrium reactions, yet it doesn't get carried away with them.  This book remains solidly rooted to science throughout, even when it probes the boundaries of what we know of the complex processes in living cells.<br />We are treated to several very interesting, measured, and contemporary accounts of the relationship of form and function, and how cells construct themselves.  The author is very much a lyrical poet of nature philosophy as well as a serious biochemist.  There are also a number of insights into the history and critical observations of biological science, but the book never becomes history-heavy.  It is always foremost a book of wonderment at what science tells us about life.<br />There is a unique discussion of the origins of life, concluding that the answer lies in the utterly remote past, but with remarkable candor admitting that without novel and powerful methods of historical inquiry, we soon reach a limit to what we can discover about it with much certainty.  This is followed by an epilogue about the meaning of life, and the author's personal view that science must remain silent on matters of morality.<br />This is a book that brings evolution, thermodynamics, information theory, developmental biology, cell biology, and genetics into close and comfortable conjunction, and even a fair degree of synthesis in spots.  There are many profound insights here to be gleaned, and even more distinctive new perspectives on old ideas.  There is an awful lot of &quot;new wine in old bottles&quot; here in the way the authors approach each topic.  There are very few extremes or excessive claims here to criticize, it just all fits together wonderfully.<br />This is a book that will be particularly appreciated by those who enjoy Lynn Margulis' &quot;system&quot; perspective on organisms, but I think it should be read by anyone interested in deep questions of the nature of life from the perspective of science.<br />Contents:<br />Schrodinger's Riddle<br />The Quality of Life<br />Cells in Nature and Theory<br />Molecular Logic<br />A (almost) Comprehensible Cell<br />It Takes A Cell to Make A Cell<br />Morphogenesis: Where Form and Function Meet<br />The Advance of Microbes<br />By Descent with Modification<br />So What is Life ?<br />Searching for the Beginning<br />Epiloguemuch certainty.

This one isn't.  Most books in these fields are either way over the heads of non-mathematicians, or just recount the story of the origin of the field.<br />This one is extremely modest and understated, but has the special merit of explaining the basic principles of complex adaptive systems in a way that any attentive reader can understand completely.  It doesn't dwell on non-linearity, it just mentions it as one of the important principles that characterizes complex systems.<br />This stands out as not only an exceptionally clear description of the basic principles with simple understandable examples, but also a surprisingly dull read if you're used to popular accounts rather than texts.  Going from the popular accounts of Chaos and Complexity Theory to this is a little like spending months reading Dr. Seuss' charmingly excessive rhymes, and then going back to &quot;See Spot Run.&quot;<br />So it would be easy to miss what is so great about this book, that it actually makes the underlying principles of complex adaptive systems accessible to virtually anyone.  Without the fanfare, without the hype, without the flashy graphics, Holland describes step by clear step how agents interacting with each other in certain ways that reflect 7 general principles end up organizing themselves into systems with their own properties.<br />Holland does not spend much time on thinking of applications for complex adaptive system models, he makes a brief, almost off-handed mention of the possibility of locating &quot;lever points&quot; where small strategic changes can make useful large changes to huge complex systems in real life, and the proceeds to describe his 7 principles.  This is followed by a more detailed discussion of the agents themselves that compose adaptive systems, and finally some discussion of ECHO, a class of models that illustrates Holland's application of the principles.<br />There is no mystical reverence for emergence here, or any questionable speculations, this is a conceptual introduction you can can use to get a solid background, and then form your own opinions about the topic and its implications, and go on to read the more advanced books on complexity and systems thinking.<br />This is probably not a book that will inspire you about the importance of the potential implications of the field (which are great), unless you tend to get excited reading about rules and algorithms.  It is a book that rather matter-of-factly describes what may well turn out to be the underlying structure of a myriad complex systems in nature, including ourselves and our social organizations.<br />&quot;What enables cities to retain their coherence despite continual disruptions and a lack of central planning ?&quot; he asks on the first page of the first chapter.  That's one of the few hints of the amazing possibilities raised by a real-life model of complex adaptive systems in this book.  But if you keep that possibility in mind, this simple straightforward though often uninspiring discussion of systems principles could be a very useful little hinge to open a very big door to a remarkable field.a more detailed discussion of the agents themselves that compose adaptive systems, and finally some discussion of ECHO, a class of models that illustrates Holland's application of the principles.<br />There is no mystical reverence for emergence here, or any questionable speculations, this is a conceptual introduction you can can use to get a solid background, and then form your own opinions about the topic and its implications, and go on to read the more advanced books on complexity and systems thinking.<br />This is probably not a book that will inspire you about the importance of the potential implications of the field (which are great), unless you tend to get excited reading about rules and algorithms.

US	53049224	R1KZVQ49X2U9AN	1581127006	929695350	The Theory of Options: A New Theory of the Evolution of Human Behavior	Books	5	11	12	N	N	A very refreshing look at human evolution	Sean's book is a very refreshing look at human evolution, especially for those of us who appreciate sociobiology but find some of its stronger conclusions unconvincing from the current data.<br />Theory of Options begins with a quick but solid review of evolutionary biology and the major conclusions of pioneering evolutionists like Sewall Wright and R.A. Fisher. It then diverges from the usual evolutionary treatment by asking some general questions about how what rules actually constrain selection and what pathways it might take. In addition to the usual natural selection and sexual selection, Sean emphasizes &quot;behavior first&quot; selection and &quot;splitting up.&quot;<br />The usual interpretation of evolution is that genes lead behavior. Sean proposes that behavior can lead the way in such situations as groups splitting for behavioral reasons, and then growing apart in isolation. So he proposes that once protohuman primates began migrating far and wide, there were many protohuman species which had to compete on a widespread basis for adaptation: NOT for specific niches, but for general fitness across a wide variety of niches. And that's where Sean's theory finds its center, it proposes that human evolution was constrained to fitness pathway that increased behavioral options rather than adapting to a specific limited environment as the chimps successfully adapted to the forest.<br />In contrast to the sociobiological view that the the human mind evolved cognitive modules that provide specific domains of behavior for specific situations (child rearing, food sharing, mate selection, etc.), Sean offers the alternative that the human cortex evolved through cost efficient general neuron multiplying genetic mechanisms - leading to a general purpose imaginative and learning mechanism. This is not the &quot;blank slate&quot; model that sociobiologists dread, however, but proposes that along with general purpose cortical mechanisms for learning, we evolved specific inhibitory constraints that take the place of reflex but are far more versatile. The closest thing I can think of to compare this with is John Allman's excellent book, &quot;Evolving Brains,&quot; which has a very similar and compatible view of brain evolution through increasing versatility in adapting to changing environments.<br />Now is where Sean offers something novel. Instead of just hardwired modules for specific domains of behavior, such as evolved computations for jealousy, the Theory of Options also proposes that we have evolved inhibition rewards for food sharing, hunt cooperating, caring for the sick, raising orphans, and trusting women at home not to get fertilized by another male while we're gone. His interesting slant is that morality arises from these inhibition reward mechanisms, as an evolutionarily cost effective way of increasing behavioral options, compared to reflexive behaviors.<br />The result is a theory largely compatible with most the data of evolutionary psychology, yet going beyond it in some potentially useful ways. In particular, the Theory of Options provides a reasonable explanation for the relatively very small number of genes that result in the huge degree of diversity in human behavior. Even more importantly, The Theory of Options supplies a possible pathway for taking sociobiology out of the rut of inclusive fitness and reciprocal altruism (so useful for many species, but not quite sufficient for humans), and toward a new understanding of human behavior as both being made possible by evolution and evolving beyond what we can explain purely by gene selection mechanisms.<br />Sean has a lot of self-contratulatory sounding comments about his theory in this book that sound a bit strange to me at times, especially from someone who is not a specialist in biology. This seems to be his first book after years of very dedicated and careful research into a number of fields for the sheer love the knowledge and what it can do.

US	53049224	R2XP9S1KE9IFJV	1570627444	852548265	Sex, Ecology, Spirituality: The Spirit of Evolution, Second Edition	Books	4	46	52	N	N	Feeds the soul and feeds the intellect, but not both at once	For me, the modern age is characterized by some interesting excesses, and Wilber satisfyingly identifies many of them in his spiritual journey here.  Three favorite targets I found were: (1) the attempt to make things simpler than they really are in order to explain them, which analytic philosopher Dan Dennett calls &quot;greedy reductionism,&quot; (2) the &quot;rage against reason&quot; found in much postmodernism that rejects the notion of objective reality and confident knowledge; and (3) extreme conservative thinking unable to come to grips with the vision of a complex evolving universe.<br />Wilber has a brilliant imagination and he is a very engaging writer, and this book (probably his best) deals with all three of those excesses in a fascinating way.  His overall approach is not original of course (it is essentially a spiritual interpretation of systems and process metaphysics, but there are some very original elements sprinkled here and there.  And probably the best thing about this book is that it does a competent job of presenting and integrating ideas from many diverse fields, in addressing the modern excesses, and trying to come up with a satisfying spiritual worldview for our complex age.<br />This is beautifully ironic, since what he attempts is the very essence of reductionism (!), something Wilber rails against mightily in this book when the &quot;reductionists&quot; disagree with his ideas because the &quot;reduction&quot; is not spiritually meaningful.<br />For comparison, the conservative religious/creationist critique of Darwinism holds that a universe composed of material elements that interact algorithmically (&quot;machines&quot;) cannot also contain spiritual meaning.  The Catholic Pope avoided that bind in support of evolution by imbuing material with living Spirit.  Wilber uses the metaphysics of systems and processes rather than living Spirit, making his version, (like that of theologian Haught), noticeably more (if still imperfectly) compatible with the scientific worldview.<br />But this attack of reductionism while using to make his point is the big flaw, to me, in an otherwise very compelling, ambitious, and scholarly synthesis of many of the most profound ideas ever recorded in human thinking.<br />Indeed, this book seems like it would be sure to appeal to a wide variety of people who, like me, are looking for a way of making sense of our world where we don't bury our head in the sand against uncomfortable aspects of the scientific worldview, nor reject the implications of being spiritual beings who crave meaning.<br />Technically, the main problem I found is Wilber's annoyingly spotty attention to analysis (which seems worse because he does it reasonably well when he does it), in favor of linking ideas through metaphor.  It makes his ideas flow like repetitive New Age spiritual poetry, from science to theology to philosophy and back again, but it doesn't quite hold together for me.  It feeds the soul in many places, and feeds the intellect in many places, but not quite both at once.<br />If this was just a book of inspiring metaphor, the science would be distracting, and as a work of argumentation it is largely devoid of rigor.  The result is arguably appropriate to the topic, since one of his targets is the dictatorship of materialist reasoning in science.  However, he seems to lapse briefly into some of the excesses of postmodernism or even wishful superstition when after building a perfectly good concept from the ground up, he throws out conclusions that only fit by analogy. The usual leap of faith needed to appreciate any book of religion is then required.  This contrasts with the well-reasoned argument leading up to that point.  It is perhaps, as other reviewers pointed out, that he has taken on so very much.<br />He is left, sadly, with the same problems that some populists of complexity theory have, their passion for applying their ideas goes beyond what they've actually demonstrated...they _could_ (probably ?) well be right, but they've at that point only built an illusion of scientific soundness by telling a masterful story.<br />This encyclopedic book joins Murphy's masterpiece, &quot;Future of the Body,&quot; as another magnificent attempt to construct a new spirituality out of scientific, humanistic, and religious traditions.  I applaud his efforts, and I think this is a very worthy book that introduces in understandable form many important complex ideas that most people would otherwise not have the chance to engage.  For the sake of space, I'd like to refer interested readers to many of the excellent points made in Frederick Polgardy's very fine review previously here.strated... they _could_ (probably ?) well be right, but they've at that point only built an illusion of scientific soundness by telling a masterful story.<br />This encyclopedic book joins Murphy's masterpiece, &quot;Future of the Body,&quot; as another magnificent attempt to construct a new spirituality out of scientific, humanistic, and religious traditions.

This is a beautifully written, entertaining, and educational tour of the history of ideas of modern science.  It seems to have been a serious attempt to provide a single relatively encyclopedic overview of the concepts central to our modern exploration of nature, in a cohesive intellectual framework, and thus tell &quot;the story of science.&quot;<br />In an ending chapter called &quot;What the Devil Does It All Mean ?&quot; the author remarks, &quot;Most of the main concepts of modern science are familiar to the man in the street as the language of the Aztecs.&quot;  In an age when it is becoming more important than ever to be making informed decisions about our most powerful tools and how they are to be used, scientific ignorance is surprisingly the rule, and attitudes toward science are in general rarely either balanced or informed.<br />Silver addreses this book to the education of &quot;HMS,&quot; his abbreviation throughout for &quot;l'homme moyen sensuel,&quot; or &quot;the sensual average man,&quot; the usual person-in-the-street, but with their hormones and passions intact.  As Silver describes his intended audience, they are curious, but remember little or nothing of the math and science they learned in school.  They are suspicious of jargon, are worried about the future of the planet, are more streetwise than the average scientist,  and may enjoy a glass of single-malt whiskey at the end of the day.<br />This is a truly excellent book introducing modern science, in a very gut-level way, in its dual role as both a compendium of cultural knowledge and a powerful philosophy of nature.  Silver is a superb writer and covers a lot of relevant intellectual history in a very readable and entertaining way.  As the Kirkus Review aptly put it, the author speaks with a confident air about most topics, but rarely seems arrogant.  The result is a tone that most often leaves you feeling informed adn hungry for more rather than confused or intimidated.<br />Some of the chapters, such as those on philosophy of science, fairly sparkle with simplicity and brilliance in making very complex ideas and their authors accessible for the general reader.  Others, like the story of the eccentric musings of geneticist J.B.S. Haldane one day in his office, lend a certain air of reality to the theorists and their ideas to balance the usual reverence afforded them.  The author is also generous with examples of the relevant views of cultural figures like the poets Alfred Tennyson and Matthew Arnold, and how they responded to the ideas in the theory of evolution and its implications for religion.  The author concludes his section, &quot;The Descent of Man&quot; by saying, &quot;We have evolved from the living world, and one of the gifts that Darwin gave us was to place us in that world, not as conquerors with spoils but as inheritors with responsibilities.&quot;<br />This is a book that can help virtually any non-specialist appreciate what the deal is with science and why it is held with such reverence in most of the modern world.  The major scientific ideas aren't merely described, they are put into perspective as to where they came from and why they caught on when they did, as well as where they retain important weaknesses and the all-important potential for change when we make unexpected new observations.<br />This book takes on a wondrous and much needed mandate, to place scientific knowledge into perspective in the modern world and educate us in its ways.  Unfortunately, this does seems to be a bit too ambitious a task, because as good as this book is it does seem to have a few errors when the author wanders farthest afield from his areas of personal expertise (though those areas he is skilled with appear remarkably many and broad).  There also seem to be a number of minor inaccuracies, or at least debateable points, and a few confused (or at least confusing) sections.  In general, however, the the author does a good job pointing out where a subject is simply too complex to do justice to in a non-mathematical non-specialist book, or where he just doesn't grasp the topic well enough to cover it as well as he does in most sections.<br />As potent an advocate for science and enemy of anti-science as the author seems to be throughout this book, he does provide a helpful balance and seems to keep in mind the uncharacteristically modest quote from Laplace that begins the Preface: &quot;That which we know is a little thing; that which we do not know is immense.&quot;<br />Sadly, the author died in 1997, just before this book went into publication.  He left a very admirable legacy with this book.a subject is simply too complex to do justice to in a non-mathematical non-specialist book, or where he just doesn't grasp the topic well enough to cover it as well as he does in most sections.<br />As potent an advocate for science and enemy of anti-science as the author seems to be throughout this book, he does provide a helpful balance and seems to keep in mind the uncharacteristically modest quote from Laplace that begins the Preface: &quot;That which we know is a little thing; that which we do not know is immense.&quot;  <br />Sadly, the author died in 1997, just before this book went into publication.

The entires are frequently much too long and too detailed to represent merely definitions, but they are brief enough to satisfy the curiosity of most readers, and to stay  very focused.<br />The best thing about this book is that the entries themselves are so very well researched and balanced, albeit often uninspired.  The author has a real knack for cutting to the core of each idea right from the start, and then exposing the strongest view of both advocates and critics of that idea.  There is a strong sense of the author attempting to be objective in each case, rather than trying to add his own spin.  This is much closer to a true reference in style than an entertaining or satirical work like Ambrose Bierce's &quot;Devil's Dictionary.&quot;  While it does a good job as a reference for the curious, the entries don't really hold your interest well enough to read it through from cover to cover.<br />This book has one very baffling aspect.  Throughout the text, it is completely devoid of references or &quot;further reading&quot; suggestions !  For a book intended as a resource for curious readers, this is hard to explain and very disappointing.  There is a small section at the very end with 3 pages of general reference works.  Like the entries in the text, these are particularly well chosen, however there is no way to know how to proceed to further investigate any particular topic in the text.<br />The author is not an academic, but prepared the book with the assistance of many scholars. Even so, it seems to me that after all the research that Chris must have gone through to compose many of these superb and hard-to-define entries, he would have wanted to show where he got the information and where to get more.  There is also the neccessary limitation of size, this book is less than 500 pages, so many interesting topics have been omitted.<br />This is a good, informative book covering in extremely lucid entries even the most difficult topics, many of which are otherwise nearly impossible to define without wading through difficult specialized texts.  If the author had included some reading suggestions with each entry, and the publisher had the confidence to expand this to something closer to the 800 pages of Kenneth McLeish's &quot;Key Ideas In Human Thought,&quot; this would have been a superb reference book.  As it stands, it is a wonderful companion to McLeish, and I anxiously await the next volume if Chris continues this very valuable work.<br />For those using this as a starting place for building a library of reference works on modern ideas in general, it is probably also worth mentioning the dated but classic 5 volume reference book of concepts, &quot;The Dictionary of the History of Ideas,&quot; 1973, from Scribner.mely lucid entries even the most difficult topics, many of which are otherwise nearly impossible to define without wading through difficult specialized texts.

He addressed an audience that otherwise might not have been inspired to engage Darwin, and left them with the amazing and somewhat disturbing implications of a world guided by the Darwinian hand of selection and adaptation rather than the divine hand of the Bible.<br />In &quot;Darwin's Dangerous Idea,&quot; Dennett takes the flag of natural selection on to its next step, toward a secular view of nature where meaning may be found in natural history.  Dennett is a forceful and persuasive polemicist capable of making Darwin's core idea both understandable and hard to argue.<br />Sure, many will remain unconvinced that the &quot;universal acid&quot; of Darwin's algorithm of variation and selection reveals the bare bones of just about anything, as Dennett argues.  But Dennett does exactly what we expect from an excellent analytic philosopher of his calibre, and all too often don't get, a powerful and enduring argument for the usefulness of a very basic idea.<br />The greatest danger of Darwin's idea is not, as many religious conservatives seem to fear, that Darwin will erode faith in God.  As powerful as Darwin's dangerous idea is, it has not itself been a threat to religious faith.  The faithful have always had a way to reconcile their faith with the modern view of natural history along Darwinian lines.  The greatest danger  is that Darwin's idea seduces us into telling second rate evolutionary stories that don't add to our real understanding the way Darwin's core concept does.  As Dennett says, the greatest danger of Darwin's idea is its seductiveness.<br />Dennett brings the power of Darwin's view of nature to us in a renewed and clarified form, and makes many of its implication startlingly clear.  But then he leaves us to wonder what is left once the &quot;universal acid&quot; of Darwinism had eroded the rest of our cherished ideas.<br />Dennett doesn't always convince me that he has quite eroded *all* of the other ways of viewing nature by making such a forceful case for Darwin's selection and adaptation, but he does make it clear that these are ideas that must be understood and applied if we are to truly understand our role in nature.  Whether we can take them as far as Dennett does, that's left to the reader to decide.<br />While I can't agree with all of the nuances and implications of Dennett's arguments here, it is very hard to find specific fault with them, and I certainly was left with the feeling that Dennett is more right then wrong in his conclusions.  The greatest weakness of this book, like Dawkins' Selfish Gene, is that it is perhaps _too_ compelling, it seems to lead us beyond science and into a secular religion of sorts.t of our cherished ideas.  <br />Dennett doesn't always convince me that he has quite eroded *all* of the other ways of viewing nature by making such a forceful case for Darwin's selection and adaptation, but he does make it clear that these are ideas that must be understood and applied if we are to truly understand our role in nature.

Great literature is inspiring and life-changing, taking us to new places and leading us to think in new ways.  It brings you not only into the author's mind but into their whole cultural millieu, to a time and place that we wouldn't have otherwise experienced or understood.  Western culture is of course just part of the world's vast storehouse of ideas and stories, but it is one of the deepest and profoundest parts.  In &quot;Great Books,&quot; film critic David Denby unapologetically focuses on his experience at Columbia with some of the classics of Western literature.<br />Denby regales us with his enviable experience of being re-introduced to great literature as an adult, engaging the classics as an enthusiastic and willing observer instead of a bored and cynical youth obsessed with carving their own niche.  Unlike his classmates, Denby has the luxury known mostly only to the mature, to actually enjoy the trip rather than using the readings as a springboard to show his own cleverness and garner good grades.  His honest enthusiasm shows through as we experience a taste of great literature through his eyes.<br />While this book is somewhat a summary of some of the classics, it would fail on that basis alone, paling in comparison to the Cliff and Monarch notes, just as those notes pale in comparison to the original works.  This is not a book to read to understand the classics of Western literature, nor to help with any scholarly pursuit of knowledge.  This is a very pleasant and enjoyable excursion through great literature along with someone in the unique position to be an experienced critic, a skilled writer, and an enthusiastic student viewing the subjects as if for the first time.  If reading this book and sharing the author's enthusiasm encourages you to read the classics, it has done a wonderful thing.  If you read this book to get a condensed version of the originals, a vicarious education through Denby's interpretation, you will be sadly cheated.<br />This is a fun book for lovers of great books, but it is not itself a great book.  I hope it inspires more people to understand why some of us love great books.ou will be sadly cheated.  <br />This is a fun book for lovers of great books, but it is not itself a great book.

But in the end, believers will enjoy it and non-believers will find it infuriating.  Dembski's work has often unfairly been described as 'thinly disguised creationism' because of his political associations, and his associations with all that awful anti-evolution rhetoric among many of his colleagues.  However, his work here stands on his own in some ways.<br />Dembski does come up with good criteria for detecting design in nature.  It is in the final step in Dembski's reasoning, how design in nature is to be explained, that reasonable people may well strongly disagree.  It is in the question of the role of naturalism in explanations that we find the most difficult sticking point, as a careful analysis of Phillip Johnson's books (such as Wedge of Truth) clearly reveals.<br />Dembski's work here is clever, careful, and creative.  He does an admirable job of deriving reasonable criteria for detecting design in nature according to information theoretic principles.  I don't consider this 'junk science' as some have claimed.  In the end, of course, Dembski relates his discovery of specified complexity criteria for design with the God of the Bible, an intelligent update of Paley's design argument.<br />The question to me when I read this was not whether Dembski succeeded in coming up with useful design criteria.  I decided that he did indeed.  The question for me was whether he also made a convincing argument that Darwinian mechanisms could not have resulted in specified complexity in nature.<br />The technical issue seems to be this.  His argument seems to me to potentially confuse different kinds of information. After deriving his criteria for complex specified information, Dembski tells us that blind processes cannot increase complex specified information, because neither selection nor random mutation add information.<br />It's a persuasive argument, similar to the argument that Roger Penrose made for consciousness being irreducible to computation.  And it suffers from the same weakness, that the systems we are describing are not yet competely enough described to know for certain whether randomness and selection really provide a process that can produce complex specified information.  Facing this uncertainty, fans of Darwin of course consider it entirely plausible that randomness plus selection can lead to not only complexity but complex specified information in Dembski's sense. Fans of Dembski will probably find his argument compelling that Darwinian processes can never produce true randomness.  And there are a third group, following complexity theory or modern developments in genetics, who find that Darwinian processes can yield complex specified information if suitably enhanced by additional laws of nature.<br />So Dembski's argument for design in this book seems sound, the question is still, as it always was, whether design can be explained by true novelty arising through Darwinian processes or whether true novelty cannot arise spontaneously in nature.<br />Understandably, this is a powerful sticking point because it reveals very different views of the inherent structure of nature, either a pre-existing design or an emerging one.  In soem ways, this brings to mind our political extremes of the conservative's structured world and the liberal's dynamic free-for-all.  Dembski provides us with a useful plank for the conservative religious worldview, though it won't convince those who have assumed all along that the structure of the world is a dynamic, evolving thing.  These are very different visions of how the world works.s a persuasive argument, similar to the argument that Roger Penrose made for consciousness being irreducible to computation.

Hypnosis is a powerful tool for self-insight and in clinical settings, but its effect on the imagination can lead us in bizarre directions fairly easily compared to some of the current cognitive and behavioral techniques in psychology.  But that's also the lingering power of hypnosis for us, it creates the conditions - sets the stage - for making more flexible changes in our thinking patterns.  The fact that hypnosis is so easily misused is why a balanced, intelligent appraoch like Roy's is so important.<br />My own exposure to hypnosis started very early, and I've been fascinated with it all my life.  When I read a book on it, it is usually about new scientific research into how suggestion effects work and under what conditions because it seems to be that this kind of research tells us a great deal about the mind.<br />Personally I don't consider hypnosis &quot;how to do it&quot; books extremely enlightening for people once they get the basic idea that the mind is heavily led by metaphor, and particular language patterns can bring particular different kinds of cognitive and emotional effects in us. A reasonably creative person can come up with better and more specific 'scripts' for themselves than most they can find in books fairly easy once they get the knack.  But the problem is getting the initial knack and getting past the mystique of the art.<br />Where Roy has done a tremendous service here is in getting you past the mystique and into a real understanding of hypnosis in a practical way so that you can begin to explore this fascinating art for yourself.  My only negative comment about the books is that it relies on a model of the &quot;subconscious mind&quot; that I think is archaic to explain hypnosis.  That is a relatively small criticism, however, since this is a practical book and not a psychology text intended to clarify such difficult topics in science and philosophy of mind.<br />For people wanting to learn to hypnotize, I generally recommend starting with self-hypnosis along with a study of the science and the history behind it.  And for your first exposure to self-hypnosis, one of your best bets would be Roy's excellent book here.ever, since this is a practical book and not a psychology text intended to clarify such difficult topics in science and philosophy of mind.<br />For people wanting to learn to hypnotize, I generally recommend starting with self-hypnosis along with a study of the science and the history behind it.

Books	4	75	81	N	N	Balanced and helpful, but also frustrating	In the neverending battle to define &quot;what is real&quot; for each other, to persuade each other of what is good, bad, and important, one disturbing trend in academia is to jump on the bandwagon of things considered &quot;socially constructed.&quot;  The banner of social construction has become a lightning rod of sorts for all sorts of bizarre things that represent what the author refers to in terms of &quot;rage against reason.&quot;  X was socially constructed, and therefore is unreal, and even bad, and should be modified or replaced by Y.<br />Emotions, knowledge, the mind, the economy, the deficit, gender, mental illness, even facts and reality, all have been subjected to literary claims that they are &quot;socially constructed.&quot;<br />Hacking provides an interesting perspective on this whole trend by de-emphasizing the social aspect and focusing on the construction aspect.  He views this simply as a way of arguing against the inevitability of something.  For example, arguing about 'social construction' of our understanding of quarks in physics, part of the standard model, the question becomes whether an alternate equally successful science could have arisen that had no such concept as a quark.  Hacking then struggles with what a successful science means, and how we would recognize it.  There are many examples that follow this pattern, each discussed in terms of whether X was inevitable, and thus how else it could have been constructed in our minds and in culture.<br />Hacking goes as far as an offhanded treatment of nominalism and essentialism relevant to this inevitability question (essential qualities are those that are seen as inevitable).  He breaks down difficult questions into relatively simple ones using this same kind of straightforward procedure.  In analyzing the social construction of X for many examples, he looks for those elements of X that were inevitable, and those that serve &quot;extra-theoretical&quot; purposes and could have been constructed differently.<br />One particularly unique aspect of hacking's work here, the prototype of social constructionism here is not the sociology of science in general.  He uses Pickering, LaTour, and Woolgar as his prime examples, rather than folks like Harry Collins and Trevor Pinch, who are often considered in the same category.  Hacking considers them distinct for his purposes, and this reveals some interesting distinctions.<br />What I liked best about this book is that while it is carefully done, there is an offhanded air about the points Hacking makes.  He makes some very difficult analyses seem very easy by pulling particularly useful examples from the literature.  He navigates a lot of difficult philosophy by asking deceptively simple questions, like &quot;what is the point ?&quot; rather than &quot;what is the meaning ?&quot;<br />There are some interesting sweeping gestures here like claiming that social construction can simply by thought of as an argument against the inevitability of X, and then analyzed for how committed the author is to claiming X is bad and overturning X. Another interesting example is Hacking's description of essentialism as simply a way of talking about inevitability.<br />This book is somewhat disappointing if you're looking for simple answers to each of the questions posed, &quot;is X socially constructed or not ?&quot;  However, it provides an extremely helpful way of looking at each case and trying to decide whether a 'social construction' critique actually has any value, or whether it just gives the history of the topic.  Perhaps most useful is Hacking's &quot;3 sticking points&quot; with which to address the construction of a concept:  contingency, nominalism, and stability.<br />This is a thinking person's book, but not nearly as incomprehensible to the layman as most works of modern philosophy, and much easier to read and more helpful than most of the &quot;social construction&quot; literature itself.<br />I'd go as far as to say that in many cases, we could replace the &quot;social construction of X&quot; arguments with Hacking's style of analysis about inevitability and the 3 sticking points, and come up with a more enlightening answer about the reality of the X in question.<br />If there is any flaw that I found here it is that I didn't think there was enough detail provided on any one topic to resolve the questions asked, they are pretty much all examples, and more questions are raised than answered.

He has produced a remarkable and deceptively innovative text that could productively be used in a broad range of fields.<br />The topic of game theory is interesting to many people because it describes interaction between competitors, presumably helping us pick the best strategy if the circumstances are well enough understood.  We might wonder whether the circumstances are well enough understood in daily life to apply the methods of game theory to our own choices,  since it usually to assume that we are rational competitors trying to maximize our own gain.<br />Game Theory Evolving addresses this fascinating question not from a theoretical perspective so much as giving the reader the tools for investigating it themselves in two distinct but complementary ways.<br />First, it provides practical problem-oriented chapters for learning the principles and thinking in terms of game theoretic methods.  The problems are not the usual textbook &quot;who cares, anyway ?&quot; type.  Rather they are fun and interesting to solve and often lead to direct insights into real situations.<br />Second, it extends game theory into the realm of evolutionary thinking, so we not only understand strategic action but we get some deeper insight into how our historical needs shaped our behavior and even our thought processes.  Game theory may help explain how we learned to cooperate and why under some conditions we tend to punish cheaters and treat people fairly even though it provides no apparent advantage to us.<br />Disguised as a lowly academic textbook, Game Theory Evolving is actually a basic toolkit, a passport into the remarkable modern study of evolutionary thinking about human nature, through a practical grounding in the mathematical techniques that have the potential to join our understanding of social sciences and biology.	2001-02-18

Be frustrated more easily by the same things as others (to shift between being ok and being overwhelmed very quickly)<br />2.  To experience frustration more intensely and feel more overwhelmed by it than others<br />3.  To become more cognitively debilitated than others during frustration<br />4.  To rely more heavily on concrete, inflexible black and white thinking than others (not clear whether this is part of cause or effect - probably both) - and which is less responsive to presentation of consequences and either intrinsic or extrinsic motivation<br />5.  To experience emotional overwhelmed and cognitive debilitation particularly often when exacerbated by other things that can serve as sources of persistent frustration such as moodiness, anxiety, hyperactivity, obsessiveness, or social impairment of some kind.<br />Greene's faith is that learning to routinely interpret behaviors of stubborn or difficult children in this light, rather than acts of willful defiance can help provide more resourceful and humane responses to the behavior.  In particular, his strategies lean toward temporarily creating an environment where practical where the child's deficits in adaptiveness are less of a handicap, and toward focusing the most on the things parent and child have most control over, helping them to break the escalating cycles of inflexibility and blaming and instead move toward something constructive on both sides.  Also, the strategy is to reduce the child's dependence on the tailored environment, but only after gaining some sense of control and receptivity to changes.<br />Discusses both the use and limits of rewards and punishments and how to make them more effective, the role of medication, thoughts on education (treating temperament effectively as a kind of learning challenge like dyslexia and adapting schoolwork to it), and the role of the increasing sense of alienation that appears common to these particularly easily frustrated children (as when alienation and deviation become part of developing adult identity).<br />This book is particularly well-written, with good summaries of each of the richest chapters, realistic examples, and a nice balance heavy on practical help and understanding, and light (but not non-existent) on theory and background.  Even those who don't agree with the author's premise about the difficult frustrated temperament will still find many useful ideas here.h sides.

It is not a cohesive critique of the field at all, nor does it detail any specific excesses or flaws in actual evolutionary psychology research programs.  It is largely a collection of philosophical essays, some of which are recycled arguments from the earlier sociobiology wars so well chronicalled in &quot;Defenders of the Truth&quot; by Ullica Segerstrale.<br />The arguments still seem to be motivated by the fear that a rigid biological view of human nature will leap the great divide and dominate social sciences.  And the responses to these critiques seem to verify that indeed the central issues are how mutable we view culture, how we characterize cultural evolution, and what it means for social and political policy.  The verification of specific scientific theories gets surprisingly little attention.<br />I was expecting more detailed essays on the legitimate technical issues such as the problem of confirmation of evolutionary adaptations, the problem of psychological types, the problem of psychological modules, the definition of adaptation, the developmental systems theory challenge to so-called genetic determinism, the theory of inclusive fitness, and the theory of reciprocal altruism as an explanation of human kindness.<br />Unless I missed it, I couldn't find any mention of the use of evolutionary game theory in EP in this book, a particularly sad omission because it is one of the most reasonable bridges between biological and social science thinking, and so its status is critical what seems to be the agenda of the critics here.<br />What little of the essays addresses these pretty much assumes the battle is won and argues from there.  I found it unconvincing.  For example, geneticist Gabriel Dover's (&quot;Dear Mr. Darwin&quot;) critique of selfish gene selectionism is very interesting but odd in relying so heavily on his molecular drive theory and inexplicably avoiding raising many of the excellent points that others like Sober and Eldredge have made about selection dynamics at different levels.  Not that I found much wrong with it, it would stand alone well by itself.  But it illustrates the general problem with this book, that it makes some good specific points but never quite ties them together as a constructive (or even coherent) critique of EP.<br />Compared to Paul Ehrlich's &quot;Human Natures&quot; for example, this book is very poorly researched in my opinion, though both will likely be about as equally despised by many evolutionary psychologists, for different reasons.  &quot;Alas&quot; because it mainly just opens up old wounds without contributing much to the dialog, and &quot;Human Natures&quot; because while more scholarly than &quot;Alas,&quot; and more educational about evolution generally, it still argues largely orthogonally to EP rather than constructively about it.<br />Surprisingly, both books largely avoid much of the useful critique of evolutionary psychology that comes from within that very field.  Understandable, I suppose critics don't trust scientists to be competent at critiquing their own field.  But in this case of &quot;Alas,&quot; especially, it would have strengthened the book tremendously.<br />In spite of the disappointment, there are some very good essays here, even where they may miss their mark on current evolutionary psychology.  In one of the best essays, Patrick Bateson argues persuasively that the word 'instinct' has become scientifically ambiguous and even meaningless.  Mary Midgley points out some of the now fairly well known weaknesses in the concept of selfish memes as a theory of cultural transmission.<br />Countering what many of the contributers here characterize as the conservative bias of EP, Anne Fausto-Sterling argues for a feminist perspective on science and Barbara Herrnstein Smith gives a fairly generic critique against aspects of the cognitive model of the mind.  Both make good points, though a bit unfocused and neither points out that the same critiques have been made from within the field as well, such as by Geoffrey Miller.  Nor do they explain why they characterize the entire field as politically conservative older white males, when that image seems to me to better characterize its populists than its researchers.  There is little evidence that any of the authors went even as far as journalist John Horgan (&quot;The Undiscovered Mind&quot;) went in interviewing or debating any of the researchers directly on any specific points for this book.<br />I appreciate the underlying theme of many of these authors that human nature (or as Ehrlich puts it, &quot;natures&quot;) is complex and often oversimplified, but they authors give the impression of throwing up their hands rather than giving it a try.  That seems to be the point of EP research programs, however their current status is perceived, to try to find real, testable patterns in our lives that we can use to understand and improve ourselves. It is in the specifics of testing and testability that I expected to see criticism, and found little to feed my hunger here.  The reader with little time can skip the chapters if they are looking for a critique of EP and simply read a summary of Steve Rose's good final chapter arguing against ultra-Darwinism, and go from there to the technical work that supports it and to the EP work itself that deals with it.  Here are Steve's main arguments against &quot;ultra-Darwinism&quot;:<br />1.  naked replicators are empty abstractions<br />2.  There is a non-linear relationship between genes and phenotypes<br />3.  Individual genes are an important level of selection but not the only one<br />4.

Cladistic analysis is popular among supporters because it provides a testable way to study the relationship between species, an alternative to evolutionary story-telling for a story we were not around to witness and may never be able to reconstruct well enough from fossils.<br />Why is this important ?  For one, it makes the definition of species potentially a more rigorously scientific affair.  For another, it doesn't rely on what some critics of evolutionary theory correctly characterize as unfalsifiable wild guesses about trees of descent.<br />Finally, it potentially yields some rapprochement between the more reasonable proponents of creationism and critics of evolutionary theory and some of the less severe Darwinists.  This is because it doesn't require us to guess at whether we share a common ancestor with apes, it provides a scientific program for testing relationships by parsimony.  For this reason, it has been cited positively by critics of evoluton such as Phillip Johnson (Darwin on Trial) and Michael Denton (in Evolution: A Theory in Crisis, though far less critical of much of evolution in Nature's Destiny).  On the other hand, cladistics assumes common origins of species (at least those within a given cladogram !), which makes it anaethma to the aspect of creationism which requires belief in special creation rather than just opposing the seeming meaningless and random contingency in nature that opponents of Darwinism see it representing.<br />An understanding and acceptance of cladistics not only heralds a revolution within biology, but potentially wider culture as well, as we would come to look at the relationship between living things in a new light.  Cladistics allows us to learn from the common characteristics of closely related species without having to assume that a particular evolutionary process or path got them there, and without having to guess about the relationship of species outside the cladogram.<br />This looks on the surface like an obscure issue in biological taxonomy with little relation to culture, but the essence of the idea is profound in its implications.  Given this, Gee presents an understated account of what could well be a very important in both scientific and political-social debates over biology as it is taught in the future.<br />That said, this will disappoint biologists and biology students, who having already been exposed to the idea of cladistics will find little new or original here.

That is its beauty, however, that it leaves room for &quot;miracles&quot; as we would view them while still being an explanatory and predictive mathematics of great power and beauty.  It is so compelling to see how much of nature complexity theory addresses that it understandably scares people who have a different vision.  This book gives the impression of running scared rather than being a scientifically useful critique.<br />This book argues, rather tediously in my opinion, that complexity theory can't explain specific information and therefore that complexity theory is not really as helpful as so many of us have already found it.  We're apparently imagining all of this fruitful chaos math research, and the many hundreds citations on Per Bak's paper on self-organized criticality when it was written.  Yet Overman et. al. can't see that it could ever explain the really important things.<br />From my persepective, the arguments against complexity theory are much more competently made by the people involved in it rather than the same lawyers and such who deny it as part of their stock denials of evolution.  The scientists at the Santa Fe institute have never demonstrated that they are adverse to admitting and dealing with the limits and flaws of their theories, and they improve as a result.  Perhaps the most articulate scientific critic of complexity theory was John Maynard Smith, who has tried to find value in it but has found it wanting.  Yet even he has recently begun to warm up to the idea.<br />When we began to learn about nature through science, we believed that the Creator must have created a wondrous mechanical contraption.  Not very comforting to think He stepped aside and left us with a big puzzle rather than being personally involved in our lives.<br />Later, we learned that he is indeed involved throughout the process, evolution is a continuous, dynamic process full of historical contingencies and with plenty of room for miraculous events to lead to events we find meaningful.<br />But we still couldn't figure out how the wonders around us could possibly have come from a few simple particles and fundamental forces.  How could something as remarkable as biochemical cascades and the information propagating capacity of DNA have come from something else, even through the dynamic wonders of evolution ?<br />That is the question of the day.  It is being attacked by several groups.  The Intelligent Design theorists make a good case for the problem, but their solution is simply to leave it to the Creator.  We infer there is supreme intelligence needed to explain information complexity from materialistic physical forces.  Ok, the universe is filled with a wondrous intelligence.  Now what ?  Does it really mean that we can simply and completely reject that this intelligence found a way to build up biochemical complexity from simpler forms ? That we can simply reject the immense evidence in a dozen fields of science for how adaptation happens in species over time, and revert to the idea that all of this (or even just DNA) was created in a single act ?  As clever as it is, I[m not convinced.<br />Enter the complexity theorists.  They can explain very little in specifics, but the power of analogy is incredible.  Per Bak shows that anytime we have large numbers of pieces of something, they build up to avalanches of movement.  What happens in sandpiles happens all around us in nature, the beautiful recognizable patterns can be seen in shorelines, trees, possibly even patterns of shifting genes.<br />Things certainly appear to organize themselves in nature, and this leads to great excitement that maybe our Creator was smarter than we realized, rather than leaving us a universe of randomness and accidents, it is continuallyguided by the very intelligence that the Intelligent Design theorists propose ... but instead of being created in one step, it is constantly being created !  That's the power of the theory of self-organization.<br />It is so powerful that it is beginning to scare people.  Might such a dynamic, powerful creative force in nature imply that our previous ideas from religion were wrong ?  Might we be forced through science to accept a different vision of our Creator ?<br />It's easy to see how the devoted followers of St. Augustine or Martin Luther could never have accepted such an idea, but I think Thomas Aquinas might have seen the beauty in it !

The author takes a definite stand against &quot;propositional&quot; theories of emotion (based on intuitively defined beliefs and desires), but makes very clear what the alternatives are and what data lies behind them from the major research programs.<br />One of the most interesting aspects is an excellent discussion of the power and limits of &quot;adaptationism,&quot; where we may be able to explain emotions as evolved adaptive mechanisms, and where other explanations serve better.<br />This is a book that everyone with a slightly more than casual interest in evolutionary psychology or sociobiology can probably  benefit from, whether they are proponents or critics.  The reasoning behind evolutionary explanations and where they fall short is particularly good.<br />As might be expected, the author doesn't leave us with a specific theory of emotions so much as a renewed way of looking at the questions, and a better understanding of how to interpret data claimed to support a particular theory of emotions.<br />This book joins another one co-authored by Griffiths, &quot;Sex and Death&quot; also by Kim Sterelny, as two of the most useful books available for understanding the central issues for studying human psychology informed by biology.	2000-12-28

Not least because it leaves the door open to claims that speciation itself is &quot;improbable&quot; in higher species.  Richard Dawkins' brave attempts to rescue biology from &quot;Mount Improbable&quot; may very well turn out to be partly an exercise in futility.<br />Schwartz joins a number of recent authors and researchers to face head on the challenge of improving our understanding of evolutionary biology by recognizing that it makes perfect sense of much otherwise confusing data to allow for sudden &quot;saltational&quot; changes in species.  As hard as it remains for many to swallow, S.J. Gould was probably right about much of this, and deserves credit for bucking the &quot;received&quot; view of Darwinism.<br />This book is disappointing however, in that it seems to revel in telling the history rather than describing the new concepts.  There's just so much politics behind this issue that authors can't seem to avoid the temptation to add their own spin to the history in every book.  But that part has been done already.  Sterlny and Griffiths' &quot;Sex and Death&quot; does a great job of discussing all of the various chinks in the armor of the received view of how evolution works, without spending so much time interpreting intellectual history yet again.<br />The new part that is most exciting is the details of how regulatory genes work, their duplications and mutations, and the role they play in speciation.  There is sadly relatively little of that in Schwartz's otherwise useful presentation.<br />A very recent release in the U.K. by Mark Ridley, &quot;Mendel's Demon,&quot; looks like it handles similar deep questions but goes far more deeply into the genetics that forms the foundation for  theories of sudden origins and other alternatives to simple cumulative gradual interpretations of Darwinism.<br />One point I wanted to make as a comment to a previous review.  It was claimed at one point that this kind of theory is more congenial to the way many people view creation by God.  That's something I think is a welcome sign.  But they also commented that &quot;creationists&quot; is a meaningless label, and it seems to me that claim is simply nonsense.  &quot;Creationists&quot; deny that speciation occurs at all, at least in the origin of humans.  They don't argue that it could only occur suddenly.  Whatever else they may accept or reject from evolutionary biology or genetics or paleoscience, it seems to me that they cannot accept that humans were not special creations of God separate from other animals.  The United States is divided into those who find the close relationship of humans and apes ridiculous and those who pretty much take it for granted.  That's not an easy line to cross, much less pretend it doesn't exist.<br />It would be very heartwarming and reaffirming to my faith in human reason of some people who consider themselves &quot;creationists&quot; were to find the theory of sudden origins in this book an acceptable version of evolutionary theory, but I'm not going to hold my breath waiting for it to happen.<br />The difference is critically important scientifically because the power of evolutionary  thinking is not in whether we happen to be related to apes, but in the value of being able to apply adaptational thinking to species characteristics and describe and predict how characteristics relate to environments.  Creationist interpretations deny the central concept of evolutionary thinking, that natural selection explains adaptation.  The details of how it works and where other explanations supercede adaptational ones is what is left to ongoing research to discover.<br />That's where Schwartz contributes best to the literature, by placing &quot;sudden origins&quot; into its rightful historical context, (though I don't agree with some of his intellectual history in the medieval period).  This is not something that creationists can honestly take any credit for, or honestly use in support of their agenda it is a theory of speciation not a denial of speciation.ng research to discover.<br />That's where Schwartz contributes best to the literature, by placing &quot;sudden origins&quot; into its rightful historical context, (though I don't agree with some of his intellectual history in the medieval period).

The essence of intelligent design is simple and compelling, and Dembski is possibly its best advocate. Since it *seems* unlikely that natural processes can possibly cobble together an extraordinary information code such found in DNA, then we're left with a terrible explanatory gap.<br />Dembski and his intelligent design colleagues come into that gap with the idea that a supreme intelligence in nature must have designed it, while others following the materialist natural tradition have persistent tried to find natural processes that might somehow have accomplished the same feat. The success of intelligent design theory and the political movement behind reveals how difficult it is for any of us to comprehend the immense challenge that God or nature had in 'designing' such a thing as life.<br />We are left with the tough decision of guessing whether Darwinian processes are really sufficient to bring life into being (science being a tentative exploration afterall), and relying on our deep assumptions about nature, the theological assumption of a supreme being or the naturalistic assumption of a purely material universe that seems devoid of meaning. The place where intelligence design seems to me to go astray is not seeing intelligence in nature (for surely it is there in some sense !) but where it tries to displace naturalism as the foundation of scientific explanations. In shiftnig explanation to existing intelligence that performs sudden miraculous acts rather than comprehensible 'algorithmic' processes over time, Dembki's philosophy seemingly leaves us without the very foundation of the scientific method in some ways. But that part is actually a task more directly taken on by Phillip Johnson and his &quot;wedge&quot; strategy than by Dembski. Dembski focuses more on the miracle of information codes arising in nature.<br />Several reviewers compared Intelligent Design creation theorist Dembski with complexity evolution theorist Stuart Kauffman, and that's very good. I'd like to skip the preliminaries and go right to the punch line. Dembski and Kauffman both point out that we don't really know how evolution/origins works in nature, and both come up with different versions of alternatives to orthodox natural selection theory. Although I strongly suspect that natural selection does operate in nature, and that species do change over time, I also agree that both men make a persuasive point that we don't really understand exactly how it all happens yet, how &quot;order&quot; (Kauffman), or &quot;complex specified information&quot; (Dembski) actually arises in nature.<br />The difference is first that Dembski's theory is more intuitive, refined, and in some ways, more persuasive, while Kauffman's is more rough and speculative, and requires not one but at least two scientific heresies, in both evolutionary biology and thermodynamics. One reviewer correctly pointed out that no extant theory of self-organization completely explains the chemical evolution of the cellular information storage mechanisms, while Dembski's version of intelligent design does. Kauffman points that out in his &quot;Investigations,&quot; and admits readily that we simply don't know the answers yet. The key question is how we respond to this level of scientific uncertainty about the scope and limitations of the natural selection theory of origins. One approach is rough science, the other is a refined philosophical mixture of science and theology.<br />So the second difference is the difference that makes a difference, as they say. Kauffman's work is science, as in being provisional and generating testable and disconfirmable hypotheses. If there is any doubt of that, the tone and content of his &quot;Investigations&quot; make it quite clear.<br />Dembski's work is good philosophy and heavy scholarly research.

Books	2	20	32	N	N	Well-played but misleading sneak attack on natural selection	This is a fascinating and frustrating book that makes a number of excellent points about evolutionary theory, and the evidence needed to address the concept of natural selecton. It also takes a number of historical events way out of context and presents them in a deliberately misleading way. Wells has the clear rhetorical purpose of debunking natural selection as a theory of origins, and does a convincing job of injecting doubt into the scarecrow version of evolutionary theory most of us take away from high school biology. Wells points out correctly that what is at stake is too important to leave to misrepresented evidence. The question is: which misrepresentations are worse, his or the ones in evolutionary texts ?<br />...The problem is that in the process of compiling impressive evidence against the \\"icons\\" that serve as evidence of evolution in old high school textbooks, the author ignores the actual arguments over evolutionary theory found in modern evolutionary biology. No, he didn't actually refute the neo-Darwinian synthesis, because he didn't even address it, and of course with two PhD's, the strategy was deliberate.<br />As an aside, if he were really serious about disputing natural selection as a theory of origins, instead of attacking \\"icons,\\" Wells would have addressed a serious evolutionary biology text, such as Mark Ridley's _Evolution_, from Blackwell Science, and addressed its discussion of the evidence for evolution. And he would have offered some semblance of an alternate theory, unless he wants us to believe that scientists have nothing to say about natural history.<br />Wells should also have made more mention that there are several reasonable _scientific_ arguments against the usual or orthodox version of natural selection theory that also address its positive evidence, and offer alternatives, rather than simply discarding the overwhelming web of evidence for it based on weaknesses with its \\"icons\\" because that's all most people think evolutionary theory is based upon. These arguments can be found in particularly clear and cogent form in Sterelny and Griffith's \\"Sex and Death.\\"<br />Wells does not spend any time on these lines of argument, presumably because scientific arguments against orthodox evolutionary theory are also arguments against all forms of creationism, which Wells clearly intends to try to sneak into science by the vacuum he attempts to make in evolutionary theory.<br />If we don't limit ourselves to orthodox science, there are also some interesting epistemological arguments that attack naturalism in general rather than knocking down straw man versions of evolutionary theory. For example, \\"Origins, Icons, and Illusions : Exploring the Science and Psychology of Creation and Evolution\\" by Harold R. Booher seems very sympathetic to \\"intelligent design\\" creationism, but by arguing against rigid interpretations of evidence rather than selectively evaluating the weaker evidence as Wells does.<br />The strangest thing about evolution is that everyone thinks they understand it, and yet none of us really does, as complexity theorist Stuart Kauffman points out. Kauffman, an outspoken opponent of creationism, is also a scientific heretic in some ways, who doesn't buy the argument that natural selection is sufficient to bring order to living things. He notes that order arises in nature more rapidly and under a wider variety of conditions than we would expect if the only non-random effect on evolution were natural selection. Yet rather than pretend to know the answer from spiritual traditions, or questioning whether we need to incorporate the supernatural into science as creationists do, Kauffman builds new testable scientific hypotheses. We don't know yet whether most of his ideas are right, but at least they are science !<br />It is reasonable to question scientific dogma, but to pretend that pseudoscience is science just because textbooks can't possibly present the whole story behind every observationis a dirty trick. And one that judging from most of the reviews here, is working perfectly as intended.<br />The difference between the scientific heresy of Kauffman and taht of Wells is that Kauffman and other scientific theorists address the full range of evidence and try to explain it, rather than simply ignoring or claiming that the evidence for evolution doesn't exist.<br />An apparently intelligent, orderly universe in some sense doesn't have to mean that science gives in to political pressure to redefine its boundaries and incorporate Biblical literalism, nor that theories need to be ammended to include the supernatural, as this book leads the reader to contemplate.<br />However, this book does make a strong argument for recognizing the limitations of science, especially the popular view of science we all learn in high school and as undergraduates. And I also think that as an object lesson, it supports a reasonable case that we need more in our lives than just a reasoned evidence-based scientific philosophy. But as an attack on natural selection and its role in the course of natural history, this is not much stronger really than most creationist texts that are widely considered pseudoscience. What good scientific arguments actually exist against the orthodox neo-Darwinist synthesis are given surprisingly short shrift in \\"Icons,\\" because they are also arguments against the pseudoscience of creationism. All the more shame for the search for truth, and the desire by many to reconcile their scientific and spiritual lives. Creationism seems to do poor justice to either side of life.<br />Natural selection is almost certainly a major factor in the origin of specific forms of life, even if it is not the only factor. So I have to disagree with this book's conclusions, and find it a noble attempt at attacking a central modern dogma, persuasive in many ways, useful in others, yet in total completely unsuccessful as a scientific argument against natural selection as a factor in shaping adaptations in natural history.ation is a dirty trick.

This results in a very good review of basic neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, psychotherapy, psychopharmaceutical effectiveness, and other research areas of importance that claim to tell us something fundamental about ourselves.  We don't get the sense in this book that Horgan is simply arbitrarily skeptical of science, but that he respects what science can accomplish yet finds some aspects of reality simply beyond our ken.  Seemingly reasonable, yet easy to forget when we get caught up in the excitement over the stream of promising new findings from research.<br />The weakness of this book is that he doesn't give any indication at all that any view of the mind is better or more useful than any other, something of profound importance when we try to make decisions on what is known, such as deciding what to do when feeling overwhelmed and unsure of our sanity.  The reader might be left at the end of the book in frustration with the conclusion that we don't really know _anything_ at all about the mind and brain, which wouldn't be true, even according to the contents of Horgan's books.  It does however deserve a place on the bookshelf of anyone who suspects that we don't know everything yet, and who wants to better understand where the limits of our knowledge of the mind are now.  It will probably attract many skeptics of science, but its real value is to remind scientists of our own limitations and the depth of the mysteries of nature.	2000-12-09

They are not good psychology, technically, nor do they summarize the ideas particularly well, but they are filled with potentially helpful ideas with examples.<br />He compiles a combination of most well known principles of influence and a few more obscure ones, and turns them into specific scripts.  Like NLP books, the &quot;script running&quot; approach is likely to immediately inspire some reasonable skepticism and some revulsion in many readers.  Lieberman is thankfully free of the annoying jargon nd repetitive slogans of NLP, but takes on much the same approach, and those who find one objectionable are likely to dislike the other as well.<br />People don't want to think that their daily lives are so heavily filled with stereotyped behaviors and predictable games that can be taken advantage of.  But the sales figures of star performers and the success of charming manipulative people makes it clear that there are chinks in our rational defensive armor that can frequently be exploited.  To what degree our lives are ruled by these tricks is an open question, Lieberman clearly thinks they are the way we normally do business with each other.<br />There are not a whole lot of original ideas here, but the author has done an enviable job compiling some of the more interesting ideas and providing simple examples.  I think most people will quickly find that the scripts are examples only and not &quot;formulas,&quot; but the principles are clear enough to use, and to protect yourself from others playing cheap psychological ploys on you, knowingly or inadvertently.<br />Lieberman has a lot of simplistic but funny comments like his explanation that seemingly undesireable men who end up with desireable women probably met them under circumstances where the women were aroused by something else.  There doesn't seem to be much room for rational decision making in Lieberman's world, the reader is left to wonder how close it is to their world as well.'s world, the reader is left to wonder how close it is to their world as well.	2000-11-22

His writing is clear and precise, his organization and diagrams are inspired.<br />&quot;The Genetic Inferno: Inside The Seven Deadly Sins&quot; is a new release from Medina for November, describing using the metaphors of Dante's books what is known about the molecular machinery underlying the human experience. While it becomes awkward in parts, it works magnificently  through most of the book, transporting the reader back and forth between purgatory and the mundane vices and virtues of everyday life, all tied together by those tiny invisible molecular processes most of us never even  think twice about.<br />The Genetic Inferno compares to Matt Ridley's &quot;Genome&quot; in that they are both about the genetics of human nature, but they approach it in very different ways. &quot;Inferno&quot; spends much more time elaborating clearly what is known  about mechanisms lying between gene and behavior, while &quot;Genome&quot; samples particular genes and often speculates on their relevance to human life. Medina has a minimum of the kind of interesting digressions that make Genome so fascinating, but makes complex biochemistry and behavioral genetics highly accessible and puts them into good perspective.<br />One of the most interesting things about this book is that in spite of its heavy emphasis on the biological basis of human life, it mostly avoids reliance on evolutionary theory in order to emphasize the molecular mechanisms themselves and their relationship to behavior and experience. Yet it isn't an &quot;anti-evolution&quot; book, so much as it is one that explains human genes and behavior in a way that avoids evolution in favor of its strong metaphor and clear explanations for genes and behavior.<br />With great artistry, Medina accomplishes the difficult feat of at once making clear the gap between genes and behavior and making us aware that we are physical, chemical entities rather than puffs of spirit residing in a physical shell. At the same time, he makes the reader aware of the of how complex and wondrous the whole process is and how  little we can claim to understand with certainty about its underlying higher order principles. He ends the book with:<br />&quot;When one encounters a mysterious masterpiece filled with unknown but thrilling complexities, one is not left with the answer, one is simply left with a point of view.&quot;mplishes the difficult feat of at once making clear the gap between genes and behavior and making us aware that we are physical, chemical entities rather than puffs of spirit residing in a physical shell.

Even more surprisingly, and very welcome, the author presents a reasonable (though somewhat difficult to measure) alternative way of viewing intelligence, as tracing of increasingly complex covariation among relevant variables.  The &quot;points of light&quot; experiments (recognizing biologically meaningful things from nothing but a few moving points) provides a helpful platform for discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the &quot;module&quot; view vs. a &quot;construction&quot; view based on Piaget.<br />Along the way, the author manages to provide reasonable and well argued, if not entirely convincing, arguments against cognitive modules in general, and an interesting discussion of levels of hierarchy from genetic variation to genome regulation to epigenetic regulation to cognitive regulation, in both development and over the lifespan of individuals.<br />I was disappointed to find that there was no solid critique of some of the proposed biological theories of general intelligence, such as the putative &quot;string length&quot; electroencephalogram correlate for IQ or the recent working memory theories.  The critique hits those kinds of data only briefly and superficially where touched on at all, and mostly on statistical and methodological grounds rather than technical or theoretical ones.<br />Perhaps the most effective argumentation here revolves around how IQ tests are constructed (by selecting items so that the resulting scores correlate with predefined types of success assumed to reflect intelligence); and how they have been misused historically.  The main weakness from my perspective was  the disappointing way the book address specific technical arguments with general methodological and statistical criticisms.<br />Definitely worth reading, whether you agree with the author's conclusions or not, because its thought provoking insights into how we think of intelligence, and how we may be fooling ourselves through our own deep assumptions.you agree with the author's conclusions or not, because its thought provoking insights into how we think of intelligence, and how we may be fooling ourselves through our own deep assumptions.	2000-10-11

The limitations of this book are more limitations of the meme concept than of Lynch's exposition.  Lynch makes clear, in a way that others often do not, what memetic science is expected to accomplish and what it is not expected to accomplish.<br />Lynch briefly mentions the medical metaphor of &quot;contagion,&quot; which like Richard Brodie's &quot;Mind Virus,&quot; has clear and unambiguous negative connotations that serve distinct rhetorical purposes.  Perhaps the best known example is the comparison of religious faith to a viral infection popularized originally by Richard Dawkins (&quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;).<br />The main problem with this is that it leaves us to wonder what the host might have been composed of prior to the &quot;infection !&quot;  What does an &quot;uninfected&quot; mind look like ?  We know what an uninfected finger looks like, and it is very different from an infected one.  In spite of this, we find the compulsory paragraph by Lynch that these are &quot;neutral&quot; terms.  Perhaps in their intention, but not in the effect they have on discussion and thinking, even among memeticists themselves.  And the choice of _which_ beliefs are part of the host and which are infestations is probably arbitrary.  All beliefs are infestations in some sense in the neutral view.<br />Since scientific thinking came historically after medieval religion in the West, for example, it was scientific memes that were the original infestation on religious faith memes, not the reverse.  And clearly the two are still in conflict in some ways, seen in bold relief in Kansas.<br />The basic idea behind all this is not just a rhetorical combat of ideas however.  It is much more notable and interesting than that.  The idea is that beliefs influence behavior, in a way that can cause us to further spread and accept those very beliefs. So memetic transmission is effectively a model of a feedback loop where a belief is spread from one person to another, then that belief influences the receiver to further spread the belief.  Lynch further makes the idea more accessible by showing distinct &quot;modes&quot; (plausible mechanisms) by which beliefs may be said to propagate themselves.  But it is in the details of the transmission modes that I find it hard to believe that memetic theories can stand independently of individual psychology.<br />For example, A taboo against masturbation, Lynch suggests, might lead us to reproduce more, thus leading to more offspring, who presumably would inherit the taboo from their parents, thus spreading it.  This is an example of Lynch's &quot;parental quantity&quot; mode.  The modes, he admits, are not distinct; they interact and overlap with each other, complicating the study of how beliefs are transmitted.  Thus, the question of why an adult should retain the taboo against masturbation imposed on them as children and pass it on in turn to their children.<br />The role played by a belief over the lifespan of an individual is de-emphasized in memetic analysis, as are the qualities of individuals which lead them to either accept or reject the &quot;memes&quot; that others attempt to infect them with.<br />One of the best examples of this is given by Lynch in a brief passage about political philosophy spread as thought contagion.  He notes that poverty seems to influence people to accept memes that promise to raise them out of poverty (socialism, communism).  He also notes that memes of capitalism tend to propgate themselves partly because the bring wealth to the holders.  Finally, he points out that memes that don't make promises they can't keep (Islam, for example, makes not claim to enrich material wealth) have some additional stability because people are less likely to become disenchanted with them when they don't seem to bring what was promised.  So unfalsifiability becomes a positive factor in the longevity of meme, but at the same time, believable promises also help the spread of memes.<br />The underlying assumption of this reasoning though complicates the meme concept, because it means that memes are not just spread due to their own characteristics, but also because of the way they are interpreted and evaluated by individuals.  And that process is known to be heavily influenced by social context, not just by the content of the belief in question.  Social scientists seem to find all sorts of things like authority, group identity, birth order, the historical era we grow up in, gender, and our past experience, that heavily influence whether we accept an idea.<br />While the meme itself may plausibly influence its own spread by causing &quot;spread me&quot; behavior in its host, it probably has less success in influencing &quot;accept me&quot; behavior in new potential hosts.  That's the part, at the boundaries, that memetics becomes difficult to separate from other behavioral sciences, and seems to need to consider the individual characteristics of hosts.  A consideration that muddles the concept and its pristine focus on the characteristics of beliefs which influence their own spread.  Lynch, as other memetics proponents, addresses this important aspect, but only in passing.  A future text that makes these boundary conditions at least as clear as Lynch makes the various modes of transmission will be a particularly welcome contribution to the fundamental memetics idea.o enrich material wealth) have some additional stability because people are less likely to become disenchanted with them when they don't seem to bring what was promised.

By controlling behavior and tightening down tolerances, by intervening through steering before things go too chaotic, by trying to get the initial conditions exactly right, by repeating what works, even if we don't understand why it works.<br />Hierarchy Theory is a profound interdisciplinary approach to analyzing complex circumstances which builds on the alternate approach of taking a step back and redefining problems, largely by altering the role of the observer.  When we stop taking the observer for granted, we can change the boundaries and interpretation of the observations.<br />The role of hierarchy theory is to focus on areas where collecting more data doesn't help, where we have to look at the frame within which the data was gathered, and change our view.  It makes levels of organization and levels of observation explicit.  The &quot;bounded rationality&quot; of Herbert Simon, and modern complexity theory are used as a foundation, but they don't intrude on this explanation, which stands on its own.<br />Along with nature and nurture, does hierarchy really matter in nature ?  Probably.  It certainly has mattered historically, and there is no indication that we've solved all of the complex problems through a final vision of nature.<br />Is this theory of practical value ?  I have no idea.  But this book does a very fine job of explaining and illustrating it in a way that makes you think about complex problems in a new way.	2000-09-22

It would be  extremely difficult to live up to the insight and clarity of Paradigms  Lost, an essential classic, and I'm not sure this book quite hits that  mark.  But it surely does not disappoint either !<br />This book, like its  predecessor, is exemplary science writing and full of the most profound  insights into both the process and content of modern scientific theorizing.  Casti starts by addressing the academic 'science wars' in his usual  sympathetic but uncompromising style, illustrating how the odd notion of  the &quot;social construction&quot; of science can arise among  sophisticated scholars from a narrow look at the work of scientists.  Taking a different tack from that of another excellent writer-on-science,  Norm Levitt (Prometheus Bedeviled, etc.), Casti recognizes the social and  political influences on science while also drawing a clear line between  that and the notion that scientific theories are arbitrary  constructions.<br />A thankfully brief section on the perennial issue of  science and religion presents the simple conclusion that science and  religion are completely different &quot;reality-generating  mechanisms,&quot; in the sense of lenses for interpreting nature.  This is  a theme very consistent with and explored in more detail in Michael  Shermer's &quot;How We Believe.&quot;<br />Casti then briefly reviews the  cases made in Paradigms Lost (in order that this volume should be  self-contained), and presents evidence on both sides of each question.  He  does not duplicate much of what was found in the previous book, but builds  upon it significantly with recent research and changes in scientific  worldview in each case.<br />True to the tentative model of science Casti  espouses, several previous conclusions are altered, and one overturned.  The sociobiology controversy in particular, previously &quot;not  proven&quot; is now interpreted as having been won ... by the gene crowd.<br />Although this book stands on its own, it's hard to imagine that someone  reading this one wouldn't be fascinated enough in the details to go back to  Paradigms Lost for more background on the many elegant treatments of modern  competing theories.<br />Given the importance of being scientifically literate  today, and the misleading impression we get from reading blurbs in popular  newspapers and magazines, Casti has done an invaluable service to all of us  in framing some of the biggest questions in science in such a clear and  thorough way.crowd.   <br />Although this book stands on its own, it's hard to imagine that someone  reading this one wouldn't be fascinated enough in the details to go back to  Paradigms Lost for more background on the many elegant treatments of modern  competing theories.<br />Given the importance of being scientifically literate  today, and the misleading impression we get from reading blurbs in popular  newspapers and magazines, Casti has done an invaluable service to all of us  in framing some of the biggest questions in science in such a clear and  thorough way.	2000-09-05

We are learning to better define the categories we assign to  people, and understand the context for our thoughts, feelings, and  behaviors, rather than applying simplistic labels like  &quot;creative,&quot;  &quot;moody,&quot; and even &quot;intelligent.&quot;<br />We are coming up with better combinations of methods for studying the  contributions of the genome and the contribution of particular kinds of  events in developmental and life history in determining the way we respond  to particular kinds of situations.  The young but energetic science of  evolutionary psychology for example attempts to find patterns in human  thinking that may have been adapted from uses in our evolutionary past, and  therefore link our genome to influences on behavior.<br />All of this is  fascinating good science, even if it has a long way to go.  On the other  hand, the authors of this book appear to have no patience for things like  the significance of context on behavior nor even the complexities of how  different gene patterns combine to create multiple linked patterns in human  behavior.<br />They continue to search for specific genes for complex  behaviors, in spite of the history of behavioral genetics being so far a  series of claims to have found the magic gene for this or that, and then  failing to replicate the finding.<br />They continue to feed our hunger for  simplistic explanations like a gene for women loving other women, or a gene  for cigarette smoking, or for divorce or for overeating.<br />The failure of  this book to do justice to the vast science doesn't make it useless.  Admittedly it would be a daunting task to truly cover all of the research  and thinking that pertains.<br />Certainly many people will find it satisfying  to hear &quot;at last&quot; that their bad habits, obesity, social  isolation, and unhappiness can be blamed on their genes.  We all suspect  this, in some way, and we are certainly at least partly right.  But it is a  hollow victory in the end.  Gene patterns themselves are surely important,  but not quite that important that we can abdicate responsibility for living  up to committments, living a healthy lifestyle, and generally treating each  other with humanity and morality.<br />For those who don't realize the  legitimate advances made in recent decades through twin studies and other  behavioral genetics techniques, this provides a readable introduction to  that field.  But the reader has to understand that behavioral genetics  research, left in a vacuum, leads to very misleading conclusions when it  meets our human need for simplified explanations about why some people rape  or steal or murder under certain conditions, why we marry and divorce, and  why we act in particular ways with people in various situations.<br />Good  science dealing with complex human behaviors has to pull from a multitude  of methods before solid conclusions can be drawn from it.  When we pull  from social sciences, behavioral sciences, evolutionary biology,  anthropology, and genetics, among other fields, we get an emerging picture  very different from the one presented in this book.<br />We find human  beings responding to their environment according to rough  &quot;ranges&quot; and extremely complicated rules that link patterns of  culture and biology over evolutionary time and cannot exist solely within  either our genes or our culture.<br />In spite of what we've learned, we  still find ourselves entertained and engaged by popular literature that  makes extreme claims about complex behaviors being in our genes, or in our  free will, or in our &quot;environment.&quot;  We live largely within the  stories of our own making.

That's why it has been so popular and prize-winning. But the cost of portraying great drama is often sacrificing other interpretations and historical elements.<br />Not only does this book chronicle the sad compelling story of a child born male, forced to live as a little girl, and then rising from the ashes as a man, but also the drama of medicine and human foibles in trying to deal with this human life.<br />However, it is missing the historical context of the story in terms of sex research and the people involved in it. The drama of the doctor trying, unsuccessfully, to help patients with gender and sexuality problems is obscured by the greater drama of the eventual dismal failure and coverup.<br />Perhaps most revealing of all is our own intense reaction to the villian of the story, Dr. John Money. Carefully portrayed at every instance as a self-obsessed, evil, uncaring demon, Money becomes the &quot;cause&quot; of the child's worst problems as we read the story. Indeed, Money plays the role well.<br />Clearly, the story is partly an expose of Money's attempts to cover up his failure to reassign a boy as a girl through extreme measures. But it is not coverup of failure that is the crime here, it is the lengths to which it goes.  What drives a person to be so immersed in their own ideas that they ignore the welfare of people they are trying to help ?  That's where the book frustrated me, it didn't shed any light on that part at all.  We're left assuming that the villian is either completely evil, or that part of the story is being left out.<br />The literary problem is that the historical context of the story is missing, the all-important zeitgeist of sexuality research which existed at the time the story took place. The courage and sheer hardheadedness it took at that time to even admit to being a doctor studying sexuality and trying to address its problems was the background that led John Money to first propose a reassignment theory based on other kinds of cases now known to be very different, and then seek to support it at cost to the patients.<br />But the story is far more interesting and important than just one an egotist or &quot;pervert.&quot; It is also a story of a pioneering doctor and researcher of unusual courage in a wildly unpopular and even frequently demonized field of medicine, caught between the motive to help patients by advancing personal theories in spite of overwhelming resistance to his work, and the need to be sensitive to the needs of each individual special child. Did he simply not care about the victims, or was there another story to be told ?<br />There were mistakes of several types made, especially by Money, but the appearance of villiany really seems to arise when Money's dedication and ego meets with a patient who seems to refuse to get better.<br />That Money was completely wrong about when and how our sense of sexual identity appears, and how stable it is, would have been an understandable theoretical mistake at the time. He was among the very few who even tried to theorize about it. However, having to act on &quot;theory&quot; and affect the life of a human being put him into the unenviable position of becoming either the unsung hero who helped children adjust to unfortunate circumstances, or the widely publicized villian who convinced parents to let their child be treated to bizarre and unsuccessful attempts to reassign their gender.<br />The view of him here as a villian is in very sharp focus, but for me it was tempered at least a touch by the evidence of poignant stories that weren't told, as well as the compelling one that was.the background that led John Money to first propose a reassignment theory based on other kinds of cases now known to be very different, and then seek to support it at cost to the patients. <br />But the story is far more interesting and important than just one an egotist or &quot;pervert.&quot; It is also a story of a pioneering doctor and researcher of unusual courage in a wildly unpopular and even frequently demonized field of medicine, caught between the motive to help patients by advancing personal theories in spite of overwhelming resistance to his work, and the need to be sensitive to the needs of each individual special child.

Many complex ideas are made understandable through clear analogies, while clearly pointing out the limitations of those analogies.<br />The author tries to describe how brain states relate to states of experience; by finding common ground between many extreme experiences. Her elegant (if not original) thesis is that patterns of connectivity between massive numbers of neurons determine our overall state of consciousness. States vary, according to this theory, by how large the interconnected clusters of neurons are, and how rapidly they turnover from one cluster to another. Neuroses and depression reflect a kind of stuckness in wide scale static networks of associations. States of intense sensation all involve &quot;losing our mind&quot; in the sense of dismantling these widespread networks and replacing them with many small networks that rapidly switch from one to another, keeping us trapped in the here and now.<br />We peer into the life of drug addicts, the fearful, the schizophrenic, and small children, to find some remarkable similarities in their experience. Then we see how the experience is so different for the depressed and those in pain. By comparing these extremes, and comparing the extremes to the way we normally feel, the authors' thesis begins to come to life.<br />This is a fascinating attempt at a framework for relating brain states and states of consciousness that has a lot of potential, but is clearly still a skeleton. It does, however, make a number of testable predictions discussed in the final chapters, which distinguish this book still further from the usual speculations about how the brain produces conscious experience.<br />On the other hand, in some ways, there is more missing than presented here.  The theory of neural connectivity is very vague and makes no inroads to explaining just why a complex neural network should produce a mind.  The implication is almost that arbitrary complexity should suffice, but this clearly isn't the case.  Sensory networks seem to possess qualities of experience, while motor networks do not.  There is something more in the networks that give rise to higher mental qualities than just complexity itself, and the author is very vague in this critical area.this clearly isn't the case.

Science is about finding unifying principles  among diverse but compatible ideas, but our temptation is to settle too  quickly for the next simple theory that comes along and sounds plausible  and compelling.<br />Kagan starts with the perspective that physical  sciences have been around for three hundred years, but psychological  science as such for only a century, placing psychological science at the  historical place where physical sciences were in the 17th century.  While  the analogy is questionable, the point that psychological science is, for  all its vitality and productivity, truly in its infancy, is made powerfully  between the lines throughout this book.<br />Kagan informs this situation  elegantly by not only pointing out our need for telling simplifying stories  but also showing how some of the grandest simplifying stories, which  theorists often take for granted: (1) the notion of essential individual  traits, (2) the early influences on the formation of the mind, and (3) the  asssumed root of motivation in pleasure seeking, underlie roadblocks in our  understanding of ourselves.<br />The book points out that we apply ideas  like intelligence, fear, and consciousness to a wide variety of different  agents, situations, and classes of evidence, prematurely assuming that we  have found essential qualities in these things.  That many of these  abstractions are not so broadly applicable in the same way is demonstrated  by a select set of experimental and clinical observations that make the  point clearly.<br />While &quot;Three Seductive Ideas&quot; is oddly  disappointing for not providing its own grand simplifying theory for human  behavior, it does make specific suggestions for addressing the current  assumptions he believes are mistaken.<br />In response to our passion for  abstraction and premature creation of psychological essences built on a  house of sand, Kagan emphasizes more rigorously specifying the agent,  context, and class of evidence when we talk about these qualities.  The  experience of fleeing from a predator is not the same thing as the  experience of worrying about a mortgage payment, even though the same drug  might mitigate some of the &quot;fear&quot; in both cases.  The situation  and the history are in fact important in understanding what is going  on.<br />In response to our tendency to emphasize the role of very early  experience, Kagan emphasizes how we are more influenced by what is  discrepant than what we expect.  This limits the degree to which the adult  mind can be meaningfully influenced by very early experience.<br />In response  to the widespread assumption that we are motivated to seek pleasure, a  quality believed held in common with animals, Kagan illustrates how human  beings are also motivated by a broad range of socially relevant and more  uniquely human feelings, such as guilt, shame, and pride.  We not only  anticipate pleasure, but even more, we are motivated to avoid risk and thus  act in ways that are socially rewarding and bring feelings of virtue.  In a  meaningful way, human beings are not just hedonistic but also moral  animals.<br />No easy answers here, but a shift in emphasis that may  inspire better psychological science and open up currently blocked paths to  understanding human beings more deeply.n for  abstraction and premature creation of psychological essences built on a  house of sand, Kagan emphasizes more rigorously specifying the agent,  context, and class of evidence when we talk about these qualities.

Parry  presents, superficially, the standard responses to the common paradoxes  inherent in astrological theory.  He debunks horoscopes and Sun Signs  (&quot;All Capricorns are ...&quot;), while presenting the fuller view of  what is involved in a serious modern practice of astrology.  Parry leaves  no doubt that there are people who consider astrology a legitimate form of  counselling and forensic science.  Unfortunately for his cause, he doesn't  persuade the non-believers, if such a thing is possible.  I bought this  book because I enjoy scientific controversies, and was hoping to see the  strongest possible rational defense of astrology.  I was disappointed at  the profoundly unscientific tone and content of the book, even in its best  chapters.  Also at its failure to adequately address even the simplest  questions in any really detailed fashion.  Parry's main content is a bag of  tools for believers to use to defend their astrological practice from  uninformed ridicule.  He relies on his experience with Tai Chi to produce a  reasonable and compassionate strategy for defusing hostility and  intolerance to unpopular beliefs.  Parry introduces one of the interesting  areas for showing astrological influences, the &quot;time twin.&quot;  Astrological theory predicts that people born near each other at the same  time should be very much alike and follow similar life courses.  Parry  suggests that this is true, but does not provide any analysis, relying  instead on anecdote and things like people having the same number of  children as their &quot;time twin.&quot;  Another disappointing lost  opportunity to defend his craft is when he discusses why fraternal twins  are so different from identical twins.  He suggests that tiny differences  in the moment of birth are a big influence on personality.  This seems to  mean that even a few minutes difference should give people a completely  different natal chart, and this fact alone would make natal charts almost  useless.The one person who managed to produce some semblance of evidence of  planetary influence on human personality, Michel Gauquelin, is given  surprisingly short shrift in this book.  Possibly because Gauquelin  believed that he found evidence for planetary influence (&quot;The Mars  Effect,&quot; but that he at the same time found evidence that astrology  was useless, even beyond horoscopes and sun signs.  His theory, which is  not mentioned by Parry, was that planetary events somehow influence the  time of birth in different ways for different people, rather than  influencing their personality.  This is how he explained the finding that  the era of technological birthing and conception options creates  statistical problems in his analysis.  Even with the leap of faith that  planets can influence us in some way, if the effect is negated by things  such as induced labor, as Gauquelin suggested, then astrological theory  becomes a quaint artifact rather than the ostensibly scientific counselling  and forensic service that Parry tries to defend in this book.  This book is  most interesting in the insight it provides into how we tell stories to  ourselves first, about our role in the universe, and then explain them  rationally. It is in the level-headed, rational, but unsuccessful attempt  to defend indefensible beliefs in books like this that we see a big clue to  why we believe the things we believe.re a big influence on personality.

While others were making extravagant claims about the powers of the mind, Barber was testing what people could actually do in  altered states like Yoga and hypnosis and under the influence of LSD, and  using techniques like biofeedback.<br />This is one of his most important  works, where he reviews research that tests what happens during hypnosis.  Can a suggestion cause a blister to raise ?  Can someone's heart be stopped  by a suggestion ?  Do people really believe they are someone else in a  stage hypnosis show ?  Barber made some of the most careful tests of these  claims and his results are documented in this book.  He also introduces his  original model for testing hypnosis, the task motivation protocol, where  results are compared for people who are motivated to produce results vs.  hypnotized to produce results.<br />Barber came out of all of this with the  remarkable conclusion that many of the effects claimed for hypnosis were  real, but that they don't require hypnosis !  He found remarkable powers of  mind, but at the same time stripped away much of the mystique of  &quot;trance.&quot;<br />This book is a great classic of behavioral science, a  must for anyone interested in hypnosis or suggestion from any perspective.  It joins Hilgard's &quot;Hypnotic Susceptibility,&quot; as one of the small  handful of essential classics of hypnosis and suggestion research.  It was  republished in 1995, but quickly sold out of stock.  If you can find a  copy, grab it.	2000-05-05

First, it builds from a broader base of support, in information  theory and thermodynamics.  Second, it does not focus on the brain, but on  the experience of consciousness.  This seems at first to be a weakness, but  it turns out to be a strength because what the author attempts to explain  is how the experience of consciousness relates to the reality around us.<br />In this book, a number of different lines of evidence converge on the  profoundly scientific but uncomfortably counter-intuitive conclusion that  conscious awareness is an extremely narrow bandwidth simulation used to  help create a useful illusion of an &quot;I&quot; who sees all , knows all,  and can explain all.<br />Yet the mental processes actually driving our  behavior are (and need to be) far more vast and process a rich tapestry of  information around us that conscious awareness cannot comprehend without  highly structuring it first.  So the old notion of an &quot;unconscious  mind&quot; is not wrong because we have no &quot;unconscious,&quot; but  because our entire mind is unconscious, with a tiny but critical feature of  being able to observe and explain itself, as if an outside observer.<br />This fits so well with the social psychological self-perception  research, and recent research into the perception of pain and other  sensations, that it has a striking ring of truth about it.<br />This does  lead to some difficult conceptual problems.  A chapter is devoted to the  odd result discovered by Benjamin Libet (also featured prominently in  Dennett's Consciousness Explained, but not explained nearly so clearly  there). Libet observed that the brain seems to prepare for a planned action  a half second before we realize we have chosen to perform the action.  This  dramatically makes the author's point that human experience proceeds from  sensing to interpreting teh sensation within a simulation of reality, to  experiencing.  If we accept that the brain has to create its own simulation  in order for us to experience something, there's no reason why the  simulation can't bias our perception of when we chose to act.  So we act  out of a larger, richer self, but experience ourselves as acting from a  narrowly defined self-aware self with no real privileged insight into the  mental processes behind it.<br />This may well be the best discussion of  conscious awareness yet presented in a generally readable form.  But it  does have some glaring weaknesses.  The author takes great pains to build  this model of conscious awareness from the ground up, but then applies it  in a brief and haphazard manner to all sorts of things that deserve much  more thought, such as religion, hypnosis, dreams, and so on.  Even with the  few weaknesses, the case made for the author's view of conscious awareness  is both compelling and useful for further discussions, because it is built  on a solid scientific and mathematical foundation, and the author manages  to remain within areas that are already well studied.  It isn't clear  whether the author's model makes many testable predictions beyond those  made by the underlying theories of perception, but it does provide a larger  explanatory framework that is at once sophisticated and comprehensible.his  dramatically makes the author's point that human experience proceeds from  sensing to interpreting teh sensation within a simulation of reality, to  experiencing.

There is a negative  interpretataion of psychotherapy outcome research, showing that most  therapies are  effectively interchangeable (an old argument with some  validity), and that most outcomes are equivalent to placebo (also having  some validity, though perhaps not as far as the authors take it).<br />There  are also several useful chapters explaining why clients (incorrectly)  believe they are being helped, why therapists (incorrectly) believe they  are helping, and why we continue to believe in things that don't really  work.  Those chapters are so good, in fact, that one wonders why the  authors don't realize that some of their own beliefs could probably be  explained away in similar terms, if that was all that was required to  debunk a topic.<br />The authors' rhetorical purpose is pretty clear, to  dismantle the immense tree of  modern psychotherapies at its roots, leaving  only a vague sort of professional  counseling service involving a  straightforward short-term comforting of the distressed,  and perhaps some  of the better validated forms of cognitive and behavioral therapy. The  long term therapy whereby the client spends months or years seeking out  childhood  stories to explain their current difficulties is attacked  thoroughly and without mercy.<br />Do the authors succeed in their task ?<br />Ofshe and Watters borrow heavily from Frederick Crews and  other modern  critics of Freud to make a persuasive case that Freud didn't know as much  about his patient's minds, or even cure them as effectively as he claimed.  I found their  case compelling, also, (though not original) that  psychoanalysis was never a scientific  discipline in the sense that  analysts once seemed to claim.  So much for the Freudian  roots of long  term therapy.<br />However, the authors don't make the argument as  convincingly that all of the many therapies are really so reliant on Freud  specifically.  Afterall, as the authors point out, so much of our culture  has been influenced by the psychodynamic model that it is difficult to even  identify the influences today.  The aspects of Freud that the authors  consider the biggest  problem are (1) the unconscious mind that affects us  while being hidden from view, (2) the way the unconscious mind is supposed  to affect us through childhood trauma and (3) the privileged knowledge of  therapists to uncover the unconscious mind.  To the degree that  therapies  claim privileged access to the unconscious mind, Ofshe and Watters'  critique probably applies to some extent.  To the degree that therapies  rely on uncovering hidden childhood trauma, likewise the critiques seem to  apply.<br />The problem I had with this book's line of reasoning is the  cases where therapies are not  reliant in any straightforward way on  psychoanalytic thinking.  Some of these other forms of therapy have a  growing body of empirical data behind them.  The authors seem to dismiss  all therapies in the same sweeping argument, even though the research they  review clearly  shows that some therapies are more effective than others  for specific things.  While pointing out the positive research results for  various cognitive and behavioral therapies, the  authors seem to dismiss  the positive results with some therapies as unimportant because it isn't  explained in a satisfactory way by current medical theories.<br />The  weaknesses of the book are twofold.  For one thing, the authors, whose  background is social sciences rather than biology, hold an untenable and  archaic view of human biology as solely chemistry and biology.  Their  assumptions are  based on an older dualism, finding no relationship between  thoughts and feelings and beliefs one hand  and physiological processes on  the other hand.  In contrast, most modern biologists who specialize in  human beings seem to find that information processing in humans is in fact  a pertinent factor in how the brain and body regulates themselves.  Thoughts, feelings, and beliefs are not irrelevant to health, they are  simply not relevant in the bizarre way postulated by the Freudians.  So the  Freudian therapies may all be equally silly in some sense, as the authors  suggest, but they apply their admonitions much more broadly than that,  claiming that therapy never really influences more serious problems, which  is demonstrably false, even within the data surveyed by Ofshe and  Watters.<br />The second problem is that the authors' interpretation of  psychotherapy research is consistently biased, to the point of rejecting  data that most other independent reviewers consider either positive or  ambiguous.  The authors are so intent on showing that therapy can't work  that they ignore a wealth of data showing that cognitive therapy, for  example, and drugs can work equally well  in a number of kinds of serious  mental health problems, such as major depression.  The authors posit a very  simplistic model of mental illness, which (ironically) follows Freud's own  model, separating serious illness (Freud's psychosis) from simple daily  distress (Freud's neurosis).  They claim that somatic treatments (drugs,  surgery, shock) are more appropriate for the serious category, and that it  doesn't matter what we do for the non-serious category.  Not only is that  kind of clear distinction not entirely supportable, but the overlap of  treatments effective with both categories shows that the _treatments_ do  not fall into such cleanly distinct categories either.<br />Giving the  effective drugs, surgery, and shock treatments their due, we shouldn't  limited by Ofshe and Watters' failure to consider the information  processing dimension of human  self-regulation.  But I think we can  certainly heed their admonitions about the fallacies we accept too easily  about ourselves.  They make a number of good points about how people form  beliefs about their own problems that are not only not necessarily accurate  but also may not have much to do with effective treatment.<br />However they  dismiss the clear evidence that &quot;simply&quot; how we interpret our  situation is actually a factor in mental health.  They make the reasonable  point that this interpretation can also go astray in a number of ways,  without every being particularly therapeutic or accurate, and that is the  strength of this book.d  and physiological processes on  the other hand.

The authors posit a very  simplistic model of mental illness, which (ironically) follows Freud's own  model, separating serious illness (Freud's psychosis) from simple daily  distress (Freud's neurosis).  They claim that somatic treatments (drugs,  surgery, shock) are more appropriate for the serious category, and that it  doesn't matter what we do for the non-serious category.  Not only is that  kind of clear distinction not entirely supportable, but the overlap of  treatments effective with both categories shows that the _treatments_ do  not fall into such cleanly distinct categories either.<br />Giving the  effective drugs, surgery, and shock treatments their due, we shouldn't  limited by Ofshe and Watters' failure to consider the information  processing dimension of human  self-regulation.  But I think wecan  certainly heed their admonitions about the fallacies we accept too easily  about ourselves.  They make a number of good points about how people form  beliefs about their own problems that are not only not necessarily accurate  but also may not have much to do with effective treatment.  <br />However they  dismiss the clear evidence that &quot;simply&quot; how we interpret our  situation is actually a factor in mental health.  They make the reasonable  point that this interpretation can also go astray in a number of ways,  without every being particularly therapeutic or accurate, and that is the  strength of this book.	2000-04-21

That is, violence toward each other is not something that humans  invented or which we lapse into solely because we weren't spanked enough as  children.  Orangutans commit rape, male porpoises gang up on females to  block her escape and inseminate her, chimps conduct territorial raids and  even wage war.  Reading this book, you get the feeling that you can make a  little more sense out of the latest headlines about &quot;senseless&quot;  violence.<br />The imbalance of this view comes in because the theme of the  book focuses on the roots of violent behavior, and ignores both the equally  compelling evidence for altruistic behavior in nature and the evidence of  human capacity to regulate their own behavior in various ways, rather than  responding in a stereotyped way to impulses.<br />Another weakness is that the  book relates animal and human violence in an overly simplistic way at  times, such as equating Orangutan rape with human rape.  The motives,  opportunities, and circumstances of human violence appear far more varied  than among animals in these kinds of crimes.  It's easy to believe that the  thinking and feeling patterns that lead to violent behavior are much more  elaborate and have many more variables than in the animals examined by the  author.  The comparison of the violent acts of the different species can  only go so far.<br />People who really like this may also enjoy the similar  but more comprehensive and more scholarly (i.e. more difficult to read)  &quot;Demonic Males:Apes and the Origins of Human Violence&quot; by Richard  Wrangham and Dale Peterson.	2000-04-07

The point of this tour is that history is not a random  series of accidents.  It has a direction.  The direction is toward increasing complexity  and increasing  interdependence between things, both living and non-living.<br />If the idea  that history is not random seems pretty commonsensical, I feel that way  too. Afterall, few would deny that human beings are more complex than  bacteria,  that global media and the Internet make us more sensitive to  what is going on with other  people than ever before, or that nations are  more economically and politically linked to  each other now than they were  during previous centuries.  The thing that Wright does, in  contrast to  prevailing modern philosophy in a number of fields, is to show this  progression  as an _inevitable_march_ from things that sometimes bump into  each other to things that  interact in increasingly sophisticated and more  complex ways.<br />The organizing principle behind this grand tour of  evolutionary and cultural history  is the &quot;non-zero sum game,&quot; a  concept taken from the mathematical theory of games.  The idea is that  interactions between entities sometimes involve competing for a limited  resource,  and sometimes involve cooperating for mutual gains.  Shades of  the &quot;win-win&quot; philosophy shoved down our throats by management  consulting authors the last decade.  Except that Wright sees legitimate  mutual gains all over the place, from the primordial soup to  computer  networking, and a tendency for things that take advantage of non-zero sum  games  to be selected in preference to others.<br />Wright does an  interesting and erudite job of examining history to look for evidence of  progression and mutual gains.  He also competently and accessibly traces  the history of the concept of historical inevitability, both its supporters  and its detractors.  He does an admirable job of finding and addressing  anomalies to his theory, such as the persistence of war and other zero sum  (and worse) games.  What he doesn't do is to provide much in the way of  testable propositions, but perhaps that's asking too much of  a theme of  such sweeping scope that it could probably be better described as a  framework  than a theory.  I'd compare this to Steven Pinker's similarly  ambitious attempt to merge cognitive science with evolutionary theory in  his &quot;How the Mind Works,&quot;  only the goal in Non Zero is even more  difficult.  All the more reason to congratulate Wright for the  attempt,  and to appreciate that he managed to accomplish as much as he has in such  an  effective way.<br />This book is very well written and kept my attention,  even for topics in history that I normally would skip, like obscure periods  in medieval serfdom.  I kept wondering how  he was going to explain all of  the little exceptions that crossed my mind when he presented  his theme.  How could the Dark Ages be evidence of increasing cultural progression, for  example ?  He managed to anticipate nearly every one of my questions  eventually.<br />I have a couple of nit-picks with the printing of the  hardcover version of this book by Pantheon.  First, the cover of the  hardback edition is done in a strange sort of staggered  style, with some  of the letters on the jacket and some on the book itself.  Good books take  heavy abuse in my home, and once the jacket was history, I was left with a  book cryptically  entitled &quot;O Z R  Logic Human O E T W I H.&quot; Thus  rendering it useless as the nice coffee  table prop it could have been.  Unless I crayoned in the missing letters.  Ok, that's a pretty silly thing  to complain about.<br />Slightly less petty, I think, the book also uses a  very annoying form  of footnoting, little crosses for every note.  As if  they were telling the reader that there was a graveyard of ideas that never  madeit to the main text.  I found it so oppressive to track down and  exhume all of these  instances of crosses and try to figure out which note  went at which point that I simply stopped trying.  Wright's efforts at  giving the book a scholarly tone were defeated by this unfortunate choice  of formatting.<br />I'd like to mention one of the big criticisms that I've  seen levelled at this book.  The key concepts to Wright's view of history  is that increasing interaction and interdependence render certain  historical trends both &lt;inevitable&gt; and &lt;progressive&gt;.  As the  critics point out, and so does Wright, these general notions are not new  things to  claim.  Philosophers and scientists have often devoted a lot of  effort to showing that  human societies do not &quot;evolve,&quot; that  modern societies are not &quot;more evolved&quot; forms of  tribal  societies, that &quot;social Darwinism&quot; is nothing more than a thinly  veiled excuse to  justify the rich getting richer and the poor being left  out.  The logic goes that the  animal that gets eaten is a victim of its  own adaptive unworthiness, and so the poor  schlep that gets trodden on by  his peers is simply exercising his Darwinian option to be  selected out of  existence to purify the gene pool toward something greater.  Good grief.  &quot;Social Darwinism&quot; is hardly noble thinking or even remotely  presentable as scientific.  But that's _not_ what Wright is doing, and  those who accuse Wright of such thinking must be  reading this book very  selectively.  It would be unfair to refuse this tour on that basis. He  rightly points out that such interpretations of evolution are at the very  least  generally guilty of the naturalistic fallacy (confusing a  description of nature with what  &quot;should&quot; be).<br />All in all, a  very entertaining and educational romp through natural and human history,  and an interesting historical &quot;theory of everything,&quot; that could  have been (has been, and will be) done much worse by others.hat never  made it to the main text.

An interesting way to look at it, with some  potential for scientific insight.  But given that we're talking about a  very real and all-too-common daily inhumanity, the implications of the  insect research hardly describe the scope, the quantity, or even the  central characteristics of this horrific behavior in human beings in any  satisfactory way, either theoretically or practically.  Consequently, the  suggestions made by the authors at addressing the problem of rape, being  based on their hypothesis seem hopelessly naive.<br />In this book, we seem to  go from the position commonly attributed to feminist thinkers, that  &quot;rape is about men hating and wanting to control women,&quot; to that  supposedly espoused by those friendly to evolutionary psychology, that  &quot;rape is a reproductive strategy.&quot;  We're  far from being able to  say that human motivation and capacity for rape is entirely defined by  either one of those views.<br />The strength of this book is that the authors  had the cahones to say the things they do, especially to oppose the common  but extreme view that rape is nothing more than a calculated power play  intended to humiliate and socially dominate women. This should spark some  useful discussions and interest as well as controversy.<br />The weaknessses  of the book are that not only does it ignore virtually the entire body of  research on human behavior related to crime and sexual coercion, but it  does not even adequately represent current evolutionary thinking about  complex behaviors. It covers far too narrow a range of scientific data to  be considered representative of scientific thought in evolutionary biology.	2000-04-04

This is a very difficult book to review, almost as difficult as it was to read.  It is not difficult to read because of technical sophisication, but because both content and style trigger very strong emotions.  Make no  mistake, this is not an \\"unscientific\\" or hastily written defense  of bad parenting, as has been claimed in some of the prior reviews here.  Agree or not, she does handle the research with competence, discipline, and  insight.  She does not handle it all objectively, at least in the book.  Moreover, it's questionable that the rhetorical purpose of questioning a  mainstream dogma could be accomplished by a \\"balanced\\" approach  to surveying the extant research.<br /><br />This book challenges us to think of  specific ways in which we influence our children's behavior and traits  outside the home, other than through heredity.  Yes, as many critics claim,  we can find some.  Aside from the early developmental issues which Harris  acknowledges, we teach our children basic problem solving and moral  reasoning that they often apply when we are not around.  We also provide opportunities of various kinds for children to play, to interact with other people, to learn.<br /><br />If she had  recognized more of that, and written more about that, many of the harsher  and more sophisticated criticisms would probably be somewhat assuaged.  Her  evolutionary argument about children doing what is neccessary to survive  childhood is not at all inconsistent with the notion that parents do have  important opportunities, resources, and survival and coping skills to provide.<br /><br />Even within group  socialization theory, the skills don't have to come from the group, they  are selected by interaction with the group.<br />My bone of contention with  most of the critics is that this doesn't really upend the group  socialization theory.  It largely shows that parental influence is less  pervasive and overwhelming than the popular and social science models  assume.  That message would probably have inspired less virulent criticism,  but also less praise from supporters and certainly would have made for less  of a controversy.<br />Harris assuredly makes some very profound points about  the foundation of the social science model of parenting.  Yet it is hard to  avoid the feeling that she goes way overboard in spots.  The greatest  challenge in reading this book is completing it with an objective enough  mindset to appreciate what she is really bringing to the discussion.<br /><br />Sometimes she does seem, as her many critics contend, to be, by  implication, waving away parental responsibility.  Yet by struggling  through and giving her the benefit of the doubt, I found this criticism  overturned by the end of the book.  She does not outright say that  parenting doesn't matter at all, she says that it matters most to the  family relations, and less to traits and qualities as measured in other  contexts.  It matters more giving children opportunities to learn and grow in the log term and interact rather than shaping them behaviorally with praise and discipline and other classical \\"parenting style\\" points of focus.<br /><br />In the process, she challenges the reader to think of ways in  which we influence our children, and ways they resist that influence.<br />One of the most interesting points made in the book, and one often  glossed over in reviews, is Harris' defense of the concept of social  context as a determining factor in behavior.  In other words, that we take  on different roles in different situations, in much more than a trivial  sense.  This is a necessary and profound part of her scientific argument,  though perhaps it has little impact compared to the conclusion that the  effect of parenting is different than we generally assume.  I fear that  some profound theoretical issues like this will become victims of the more  general controversy over what Harris says and implies about parenting, and  some of her more extreme conclusions.<br /><br />In the end, I rated this book so  highly not just because it is good science writing, and because it  constantly engaged me and made me think hard, but because thinking about  these things and talking about them with each other is part of good  parenting.<br /><br />Another good read along similar lines ...<br />[[ASIN:0471319228 Stranger in the Nest: Do Parents Really Shape Their Child's Personality, Intelligence, or Character?]]nclusions.<br /><br />In the end, I rated this book so  highly not just because it is good science writing, and because it  constantly engaged me and made me think hard, but because thinking about  these things and talking about them with each other is part of good  parenting.<br /><br />Another good read along similar lines ...<br />[[ASIN:0471319228 Stranger in the Nest: Do Parents Really Shape Their Child's Personality, Intelligence, or Character?]]	2000-04-04

Widely considered the father of modern cognitive therapy, Dr. Beck didn't invent this idea, nor is he the  only one promoting it. Yet his expression of it, especially in this fine  book, is elegant and compelling.  There are many powerful and immediately  recognizable examples from daily life, showing how we turn hurt into anger  into hatred.  How our beliefs and thinking patterns gradually imprison us  in cages of reactivity.  This book helps make our capacity for both good  and evil more understandable.  Readers of this book who want a more  complete understanding of the topics would probably also benefit from a  number of the books talking about the evolutionary and physiological  origins of violence.  Yet, for the part of our dark nature that we have  some ability to control, this book makes a powerful and promising  statement, and is complete unto itself.	2000-01-14

They usually break down into simplistic popular books claiming that specific gestures mean specific things, and  then scholarly but tedious tomes about the myriad factors in nonverbal  communication. This book fills part of that gap very nicely with practical  real-life examples of ways we communicate and act without explicit  awareness of what we are doing.  And most importantly, it discusses the  implications of these phenomena.  Many things that seem mysterious or even  supernatural can be elegantly and usefully understood in terms of  sophisticated forms of communication without conscious awareness.  This  book thankfully goes well beyond the crude 'debunking' of pendulums and  calculating horses, and shows a real appreciation for mechanisms underlying  a number of remarkable effects.  The only weakness, as an academic text,  is that the book does not cover some of the pertinent recent research, but  its moderate scope is part of what makes it so readable compared to other  similar texts.	2000-01-14

Yet the evidence from several directions is impressive, if not entirely convincing in all respects.  _The Evolution of Desire_ should play an important role in the popular science writing of our age, illustrating both the influence and the boundaries of evolutionary selection on human behavior.  Both readable and well documented, _Evolution_ goes beyond simply interpreting modern behavior in terms of evolutionary stories.  Buss also synthesizes massive amounts of data from far reaching and extensive cross-cultural studies to reveal the patterns in our attraction, mating, and separation behaviors.  Notably, exceptions to the patterns are discussed at length.  This aspect leaves the reader with a slightly better understanding of the limitations of strict evolutionary thinking than we find with the similar and also excellent &quot;Anatomy of Love&quot; by Helen Fisher.  Human behavioral flexibility is emphasized, and our potential freedom from the patterns of evolutuionary selection, through knowledge of those patterns.  Much of _Evolution_ will seem consistent with common experience, while some will be remarkable new food for thought.  There is virtually no aspect of intimate human relationships that does not have some light, or at least a new and intriguing viewing angle, cast by the broad strokes of evolutionary psychology in David Buss' absorbing web of sexual strategies and counter-strategies	1997-07-18

It lost popularity for a while as a 'fuzzy' and perhaps even unknowable topic of study.  Now we are again studying it, chemically, socially, psychologically, and also from the perspective of how it evolved.  The evolution of mating behavior is the topic of &quot;The Anatomy of Love.&quot; Evolutionary psychologists have come up with various stories about such things as why women might have orgasms, even though they don't seem to need them to reproduce.  Can we ever really know what forces caused such behaviors to be selected ?  Should women really accept unquestioningly, as evolutionary psychologists like Fisher propose, that their interest in sex is always secondary to their biological purpose to reproduce ?  Thought provoking counter-arguments to some elements of this view are found in anthropologist Meredith Small's &quot;What's Love Got to Do with It ?&quot;  Helen Fisher does an enviable, if sometimes tedious job laying out the evolutionary story of love,  but is it the only story we can make from the evidence of modern human relationships ?  Readers who apply these lessons to their own lives would do well to appreciate that human behavior has a flexibility that sometimes defies our interpretations of our own biology, and that those interpretations often change over time.  Read this excellent account of how evolutionary psychologists believe love was selected through evolution, but keep in mind the limitations of our knowledge of what really happened early in our evolutionary history.
