I will not say anything about the story line, as I'm sure lots of readers are still working their way through the book, but I would like to make a few observations.  First of all, J.K. Rowling deserves every one of the billion or so pounds that she has earned from the Potter franchise -- she has turned into an absolutely brilliant writer, and \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" bears this out.  Second, I will not be alone in passionately waiting for the seventh book, but also passionately fearing it, because then the story will be over.  I would imagine that Ms Rowling cannot complete the seventh book by Christmas this year, although that would be nice, but I can't wait for it to arrive.  It is likely to be dark and magnificent, because although this sixth book answers a number of questions and resolves a number of mysteries from the previous series, it also leaves several fundamental issues unresolved.  Again I say -- can't wait to find out what happens next.  And finally -- Alan Rickman needs to be careful and not get run over by a bus, because I will eagerly await his performance of Severus Snape in the sixth film.  Won't say another word about why, but I will.  J.K. Rowling, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you -- absolutely brilliant, and lord, what will we Muggles do when you have finished the story?	2005-07-17
US	53027832	R31YRV4B4SO1MG	0312082991	523148234	Sorry Now?	Books	5	1	1	N	Y	Another gem	Two quick comments.  First, I hope that the reviewer who said that he would never read a Zubro book will change his mind, because if he didn't like this one, that surely doesn't mean that he wouldn't like others - the Paul Turner series is one thing, the Tom & Steve series is another, and I would really urge the reader to try again.<br /><br />The other thing is this new Amazon thing of \\"statistically improbable phrases\\" - in this case the \\"statistically improbable phrases\\" are two extremely vulgar phrases, and I am surprised (to put it mildly) to see Amazon posting these on its Internet site for all to see.  I'm not personally offended, but I'm not everyone, and I think plenty of people will say \\"for shame!\\"	2005-04-17

I have to confess that since the advent of the Internet I have not bought many cookbooks on paper, but I use this one more than any other.  Jennifer Brennan has grouped the recipes not by country or cuisine, but rather by cooking style - stir frying, deep frying, etc.  The recipe for Kung Pao chicken is the best I've ever tasted, the Malaysian curry rolls are to die for - those are just a few of the recipes in what is truly an outstanding cookbook.  I've broken the spine on mine - maybe I'll have to get a new copy!	2004-06-09

I must confess that since the advent of the Internet, I have not found it necessary to buy many cookbooks (sorry, authors), because the recipe for just about anything can be found on the virtual Web, but this book caught my eye, went on my Amazon Wish List and was received for Christmas.  What an absolute treat!  The recipes as such are almost secondary in this book, because the point is that all of them have been contributed by American authors, including such jaw-dropping talents as Pete Dexter and Elmore Leonard.  And Jay McInerney and E. Annie Proulx.  And many more.  Now, as one who likes to cook and has by dint of circumstance done so in Eastern Europe for more than a decade now, I find a distressing reliance in some of these recipes on such things as Campbell's soups.  With the possible exception of the most detailed bisques and, perhaps, Bouillabaisse, soup is so easy and wonderful to cook at home that there should be no excuse for this.  But I digress.  The true joy to this book is the writing which accompanies many of the recipes.  Thus, for instance, you would never find this ingredient in the oeuvre of Julia Childs:<br />1 lb. turkey hearts (Do not attempt to collect individually - very messy and inconvenient to the turkeys)<br />Or instructions such as this;  &quot;Now serve with rice and, on the side, a well-iced can of Pabst Blue Ribbon, one per guest, with extra in the icebox.  Without the Pabst is okay, but not true Appalachian&quot;.<br />This is a book which would be appropriate not just for those who spend lots of time in the kitchen, but to anyone who enjoys American literature.  There's enough for both kinds of people (and I'll bet lots of Amazon users correspond to both descriptions).  I can't recommend this book more highly!	2004-01-11

It was an enjoyable read, but uneven.  After all, you can't possibly put Elmore Leonard's dialogue and Carl Hiaasen's sense of the ridiculous into two succeeding chapters and expect there to be a smooth transition.  There isn't.  The story is fun, though, and a key point to the book is a fairly detailed index of the authors, which tells us that the characters who are presented in the book can be found in other novels by the many different authors.  That's a treat, and I'm sure I'll be picking up some of the novels in which these people first appear.  The plot in &quot;Naked&quot; is a bit thin on the ground, but you can't really expect this enormously talented group of authors to come up with anything less than a very enjoyable afternoon of reading.	2002-10-19

I've loved every one of the Alex Reynolds mysteries, not least because I grew up in Chicago and can relate to all of the scenery (it seems to me that \\"Charlene's\\" is actually Carol's Speakeasy, which did have big neon lips on the walls and has been long, long gone - too bad for that).  Get off the boat, Publisher's Weekly - I'm going to be the fourth Amazon reader to give this book a good review.  I did have to wonder, though, what the author thought on September 11.  There's a reference to the World Trade Center in the book - a \\"World Trade Center amount of explosives\\".  There's a great deal that reads differently now, after 9/11, than it would have before then.  But that just makes the author prescient, albeit tragically so.  \\"Chicken Asylum\\" is the first of the mysteries that doesn't use a letter play in its title - ...\\"National Nancys\\", etc., but it's none the less wonderful for it.  I'm glad to join Amazon's No. 1 reviewer, Harriet, in recommending this book - and if you haven't read the other ones, they're all available here!	2002-10-19

I always watch &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; here in Europe with sort of a fist in my mouth - how can that woman be so horrible to people, and what an utter delight it is when someone gets one up on her.  This biography talks not only about the way in which a truly dedicated woman got to the top of her field, but also about the way in which this &quot;unfit mother&quot; really did turn out to be a wonderful mother, with a wonderful daughter and with a wonderful relationship with said daughter.  I suppose that Anne Robinson must be feeling sort of like Boris Karloff these days - he wasn't really Frankenstein's monster, and she isn't really the iron-fisted dominatrix of the television show.  I read every word with great pleasure, and I recommend the book to everyone.  The reason for four instead of five stars is that there are about three paragraphs in the whole book about &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;. I really would have wanted to hear a lot more about the author's thoughts about what is a phenomenal show.  Other than that, though, it was a great, great read.	2002-10-19

She left town, and I'm sorry, but I kept the book and have read it again and again and again and again and again and have never grown tried of it.  Wanna be tempted?  Let me quote a couple of lines from the book that will make you get teared up if you ever get teared up:<br />Evelyn stared into the empty ice cream carton and wondered where the smiling girl in the school pictures had gone.<br />Idgie smiled back at her and looked up into the clear blue sky that reflected her eyes and she was as happy as anybody who is in love in the summertime can be.<br />Eva didn't know about a lot of things, but she knew about love.<br />Sipsey was still in the cafe, wagging her finger up to the ceiling. &quot;Don't you do dis, Lord .. don't you do dis to Miz Idgie and Miz Ruth ... don't you do this thang! You hear me, God? Don't do it!&quot;<br />&quot;That's right. And there's something else I want you always to remember. There are magnificent beings on this eart, son, that are walking around posing as humans. And I don't ever want you to forget that. You hear me?&quot;<br />Then he turned around and headed for the yard to hop a train south, to Alabama. He wanted to get out of Chicago, this wind that whipped around the buildings was so cold that it sometimes brought a tear to a man's eye.<br />Naughty Bird went inside and ate three buttermilk biscuits with honey.<br />After she sealed it, she went over to the window and looked up at the blue sky.  She took a deep breath of fresh air and felt her heart rising like a kite that some child had just released to the heavens.<br />She sat there on the ground, her elbow bleeding, old and fat and worthless all over again.<br />The door of the cabin opened, and a freshly bathed, powdered and perfumed woman with rust-colored hair and apple-green eyes said, &quot;Come on in, sugar&quot;, as Idgie drove away.<br />Onzell had her eyes closed as she was singing, but she felt the room fill up with sunlight that had broken through the clouds. The warmth of the sun made her cry tears of joy. As she covered the mirror and stopped the clock by the bed, she thanked her sweet Jesus for taking Miss Ruth home.<br />After that, all Peggy ever had to do was take off her glasses and look up at him, and he was a goner.<br />It would have been wonderful, too, if Evelyn had known that the young woman who shook her hand had been the eldest daughter of Jasper Peavey, pullman porter, who, like herself, had made it through.<br />They each understood what the other was feeling.  It was as if, from there on, the two of them mourned together.  Not that they ever talked about it. The ones that hurt the most always say the least.<br />... But Artis was still way up in the woods, with his barbecue.<br />Suddenly Evelyn didn't feel cute anymore, and she wanted to go home.<br />Evelyn stopped the car and sat there, sobbing like her heart would break, wondering why people had to get old and die.<br />And the card was signed: &quot;I'll always remember.

Relationship problems?  You don't know from relationship problems, but Mike Albo does.  Literary talent?  Doesn't get much better.  Making people remember what childhood and adolescence was like for a gay person in America?  Oh, yeah.  I can't use this book to put down Sedaris, who in my view is also hilarious, in a different way -- &quot;Santaland Diaries&quot;, for example, must not be read while eating, because spitting up with laughter is a distinct possibility.  I can put up both hands to recommend both Sedaris and Albo.  I hope both of them continue to write more and more and more.	2000-11-27

Daley - His Battle for Chicago and the Nation	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Absolutely spectacularly well written	It is difficult for me to think of any other biography that I have ever read which I have found to be more perfect, and I read a lot of biographies.  I have to say that I'm not quite sure whether this book would be as appealing to someone who has never been or, preferably, lived in Chicago, because the authors evoke the geography of the city very, very often, and if I, who grew up in Chicago, can visualize all of the process, I'm not certain that others could.  The book could certainly have used a map to show the various areas to which reference was being made.  That's a minor quibble, though.  The authors have done an astonishing amount of research in providing us with a portrait of a basically decent man who ruled with great authoritarianism over an immensely corrupt system. The Chicago political machine was unrivaled in its stranglehold over any municipal system in America, and the authors provide brilliant examples of the way in which it worked.  I was born in 1960, when Richard Daley had already been mayor for five years, and I was 15 when he died, but I was well aware of the machine and its enormous clout.  Now, 25 years on, this book not only helps me to remember, but it also tells me a vast amount of things that I did not know.  Political science students will certainly benefit from this book, and fans of biographies will not find many that are better written and referenced.  I can recommend this book with everything I've got.	2000-10-03

I read the book in one sitting and found it enormously entertaining.  In no  real sense does &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot; meet its advertising  claims -- that it's going to be shocking and dismaying to professionals in  the industry who are going to see their secrets revealed.  I don't think  so.  I'm not sure I really wanted to know that this particular chef used to  engage in blood-squirting contests with his fellow cooks, true, but I  didn't see anything in the book, including information about older  foodstuffs in the freezer, that I hadn't suspected as a frequent diner or,  for that matter, seen while I was a waiter during college.  Rather, I found  this book entertaining as the autobiography of a scoundrel who clawed his  way back up to the top, and -- what was particularly interesting and  touching -- demonstrating great loyalty to his friends and supporters all  along the way.  The look which Bourdain gives into restaurant kitchens was  intriguing but secondary to me.  I can agree with other reviewers that the  book could have used considerably tighter editing in some places, and the  most screaming shortcoming as far as I'm concerned is the lack of  photographs. I'm sure I was not the only one who REALLY wanted to see what  the crazed guy who is the world's best bread baker looks like.  Be that as  it may, I was hooked on this character when he swallowed his first raw  oyster at the age of nine, and I stayed hooked all the way through the  book.  It's great!	2000-08-14

I live in Europe but grew up in the States and go back from time to time to visit family.  In Chicago, I always stop by Unabridged Books to pick up some gay literature, and this time &quot;Drop Dead&quot; dropped into my  hands.  It won't be a cat's whisker of a minute before I pick up the other  Paul Turner mysteries, 'cause this one was great.  The relationship between  gay Paul Turner and his distinctly not gay partner Buck Fenwick is drawn  hilariously, the relationship between gay Paul Turner and his two children  from a previous relationship is touching, the story is interesting, the  fashion world is drawn perfectly ... in other words, this was what for me  passes as a &quot;couldn't put it down&quot; (I can put books down because  I spend most of my time working at the computer, but when I'm free for a  bit, I keep on reading).  Even if you're not gay, pick this one up ... it's  a hoot.	2000-07-28

Rowling could put out one of these books every week, I would be among the millions of people who would be delighted.  We waited for a long time for No. 4, and it didn't disappoint for a minute.  In fact, I think it  is probably the best and most satisfying (and longest, which makes the  experience last longer and longer) of the four so far.  This one has Harry  Potter facing dangers beyond anything that he has faced before, and the  ending is one of such marvelous wonder that it brought tears to my eyes.  I'm not in the 9-12 reading range, I'm far older than that, but I've  devoured all four Harry Potter books so far, and I know I'm not the only  above-age Muggle to have done so, because surely there were not 5 million  9-12 year olds to snap up the first printing of this one.  Should you be  one of those who have refrained from reading the series because you don't  run along with the pack ... go run with the pack this time, because it's  surely worth it.  J.K. Rowling writes with an assured touch that is beyond  any complaint.  The characters are beautifully drawn, the situations are  ones which make you wish that you, too, could be a wizard, or at least a  house-elf or half-giant, and all I can say is that I cannot, cannot, cannot  wait for the fifth in what the author says will be seven books in this  series, and after the seventh one is out (I hope soon), I hope she will  change her mind and write as many after-the-seventh books as Barbra  Streisand has had &quot;last-of-the-career&quot; concerts.

I was about 20 pages in to this wonderful autobiography when I found myself thinking, &quot;Man, I'm going to like this&quot;.  All 380 other pages, I was right.  Actually, I wish I could give it four and a half  stars, because I do have one small complaint about it -- Arthur Laurents in  many places in the book seems to be writing to people who know him already  and are, so to speak, looking for themselves in the index.  The story leaps  around from place to place and time to time and age to age fairly randomly,  and in more than just a few places people's first names appear with the  apparent assumption that all of us are going to know exactly who it is that  Arthur is talking about.  That said, there are also lots and lots and lots  of people that everyone knows about, and it is sort of gossipingly  wonderful to read interpretations of Katharine Hepburn as being sort of  weird, Lena Horne as being sort of wonderful, Jerome Robbins as being sort  of way too much about himself, etc., etc., etc.  Beyond all that there is  this man, Arthur Laurents, himself.  The flyleaf to the book says that he  has had a &quot;rich life&quot;, and that's putting it mildly.  There is  not only the magnificence of the body of his work, but there's also just a  guy who lived life to its way-beyond fullest.  He smoked dope (and, unlike  Bill, inhaled and liked it), he slept around because he found lots of  people sexy and attractive, he did what his heart called him to do in his  profession, he bitched with a lot of people and made friends with lots of  other people -- in short, if that's not necessarily who I would want to be  myself, it sure enough is somebody I would like to be friends with and  know.  This is a wonderful autobiography even for someone who has never  heard of Arthur Laurents, because it is all about people you've known all  your life, but it is also a wonderful autobiography because few people who  write autobiographies ever let that much of themselves show.  I loved it,  and I think you will, too.d it,  and I think you will, too.	2000-06-27

Perhaps that's why it is so  completely astonishing to me that people in the freest and wealthiest  society in the world can become so deranged with respect to their attitudes  toward their surroundings.  Yes, there is poverty in America, but no, there  is no great, vast conspiracy involving everyone from Satan himself to the  Trilateral Commission that is seeking to oppress &quot;real&quot;  Americans.  When Americans turn God into an excuse for armed violence,  something is wrong.  When Americans feel the need to bottle themselves up  inside a nest of paranoia and violent hate, something is wrong.  When  someone blows up a building in Oklahoma City and kills children, and then  others go to say that this was a heroic act -- something is massively,  massively, massively wrong.  Morris Dees is clearly a hero, because he is a  man who has stood up against this lunacy. The book is a real eye-opener,  and I hope that he will someday publish a sequel/update.	2000-06-17

Each and every one of the several hundred  cartoons in this collection is a gem, even if you have to look hard for the  punch line in some of them (and if some of them are there just for the  beauty of the thing), and anyone who has kept up with cartoons in the New  Yorker or anywhere else will find lots of panels that will bring back a  memory or two.

For another thing, Skink came out of his woods in  this one, and for me, at least, it didn't really work -- can you really  suppose for one minute that a man who was once governor and then  disappeared completely would be able to enter the governor's residence  completely unnoticed, even if he had changed a whole, whole lot?  And  finally, the story didn't roar along at quite the same pace as I've come to  expect from Carl Hiaasen's books.  Again -- I read it with pleasure, and I  will pre-order the next one as soon as it comes up on Amazon, but ...	2000-03-18
US	53027832	RLXAANA7FIWUL	0385497466	376574359	The Brethren	Books	4	0	1	N	Y	Not quite up to par	I read the new Carl Hiaasen and found it to be a notch down from his standard, and then I read the new John Grisham and found the same.  &quot;Brethren&quot; is an interesting story with two problems.  First, the  idea that the CIA could, without any difficulty whatsoever, fix a  presidential election with nobody at all noticing stretches credibility.  Secondly, there are a number of loose ends in this book.  A character  appears midway with no apparent purpose other than to allow John Grisham to  deliver a sermon about drug sentencing and to deliver a letter.  Then he  disappears.  And there is certainly no payoff for those of us who spend the  entire book gritting our teeth at the sleaziness of the villains -- I don't  want to spoil the ending for people who haven't read the book yet, but  scratch the idea that crime doesn't pay out of your understanding of the  world before you tackle this one.  All in all, &quot;Brethren&quot; kept me  actively involved, but it was not John Grisham's best work -- I'll be  looking forward to the next one.	2000-03-18

I suspect I was not the only one who entered the word &quot;Peanuts&quot; into the Amazon search engine when I hear that Charles Schulz had died.  The magic of &quot;Peanuts&quot;, I think, is that Mr. Schulz had his  finger closely on the pulse not really of children, but of adults who take  their childhood with them as they grow older.  None of the  &quot;Peanuts&quot; really behaves or thinks like a child, and that's why  those of us who are Charlie Browns can identify with Charlie Brown, and  those of us who are Lucys can identify with Lucy, and all of us who would  love to be Snoopy can identify with Snoopy.  The 50th anniversary book is  magnificently designed, and it is just as perfect as perfect can be.  God  rest Mr. Schulz's soul -- what an American classic he was!	2000-03-18

Pete Dexter writes books about people you don't really want to know -- racists, violent  men, drunks, people who are depressed to the point of dragging you down  with them -- but he gets his hooks in you on page one and never lets go.  &quot;Paperboy&quot; is basically about failure and how close we are to it  even when it seems that life is going OK -- something can come into our  lives that takes it all apart. The story is magnificently told in prose so  tight that you can almost hear typewriter keys clicking away (Pete Dexter's  books don't read like they were produced on a word processor).  Best of  all, there are the many places in the book where the words &quot;as  if&quot; or &quot;like&quot; appear.  Nobody does descriptive comparisons  better. This is a great book, just like the other Pete Dexter books -- you  just can't go wrong with him.	2000-03-18

I'm surprised to see in other reviews that this is an old book -- somehow it just came to my attention recently, and boy, did it bowl me over!  It's a saga of two families that brings to mind &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;  or &quot;Roots&quot; in its sweep.  It's a cracking good story in which you  get to know the bad guy from the very start, and he is made to be the pig  of pigs for all 950 pages, and you just know that in the end he's gonna get  his.  And it's a lot of fun to read as you watch Ken Follett thinking about  what people in the 12th century might have been like in their thinking.  Why couldn't it have been 12th century England, for example, which first  thought of the principle of futures trading (in this case -- in sheep  wool)?  Why not a cathedral-building project where the idea of  performance-based bonuses occurred to someone? In a few places the  philosophizing goes a little bit over the top -- one of the characters at  one point gloomily wonders whether society will ever develop into a place  where kings govern nicely and people have a say in their own lives, and the  description he gives of this Eden is uncannily like Western Europe and  Northern America in the late 20th century.  But that's a tiny quibble --  this is a magnificent book, and I can only agree with the reader who  suggested that a sequel might be in order.	2000-02-29
US	53027832	RC4R6YE1Z62W3	067102423X	85988614	Bag of Bones	Books	3	24	29	N	Y	A little bit over the top, a little bit under the bottom	I hadn't picked up a King book for quite a while, because in my view he had begun cranking 'em out after such stunners as Salem's Lot and The Stand (which for sheer sweep will never be bettered in the genre).  This book  didn't do much to dispel the notion.  &quot;Bag of Bones&quot; seems to be  fairly self-indulgent for King, and I found myself skipping over the pages  and pages and pages and pages of material in which the narrator  philosophizes about himself, his life, his writing, his dead wife, his  writing, his lack of writing and, oh yes, did he mention his writing? The  three or four contemporary American authors who were NOT mentioned in this  book should probably feel left out -- everybody else was.  To me the  process was pretty much like skipping over the pages and pages and pages of  material in Tom Clancy's post-&quot;Patriot Games&quot; ouevre, in which he  tries to demonstrate that he knows more about the nuts and bolts and  computer chips of modern military technology than anybody in the universe  and bores this reader, for one, way past silly.<br />The story in this book is  a gripping one, but I think it could have been told in about two-thirds of  the 762 pages.  Toward the end of the book there is also a great deal of  in-your-face historical political correctness -- so much so that at moments  it felt like Rita Mae Brown was standing over King's shoulder as he wrote.  And finally, for me there was a problem with one of the key characters in  the book -- the three year old heroine who is incapable of pronouncing the  word &quot;refrigerator&quot;, but is completely capable of having complex  philosophical conversations in multi-part, grammatically correct sentences  when called upon to do so.  Psychic maybe, but Kyra Devore doesn't behave  like any three-year-old I've ever seen.<br />Stephen King writes in the  afterword to the book that he hopes that it kept me, the reader, awake at  least one night. Nope.  &quot;Salem's Lot&quot; kept me sleeping with the  lights on for about a week. &quot;Bag of Bones&quot; sure did not.ping with the  lights on for about a week. &quot;Bag of Bones&quot; sure did not.	2000-02-19

I can agree with other reviewers that this one goes into psychological deduction a little bit more than the others, but I don't find  that to be a drawback.  The story is exciting and taut, the characters are  as alive as ever -- Jonathan Kellerman is an absolute master at this genre,  and I don't think this novel withdraws from that reputation in any way at  all.  Highly, highly recommended!	2000-01-19

I'm another 30+ fan, and I'm not going to add anything new to the praise either.  I live in Eastern Europe, where Harry Potter didn't get the slew of publicity he got everywhere else, so I bought the first book just to see  what could possibly be so good as to be on the top of Amazon's 100 list for  months on end.  I had read no more than two chapters when I was back on the  Net to get the other two books.  They are magical and wonderful, and I hope  J.K. Rowling is busy at work on the next ones (there's a hint in Prisoner  of Abkazan that there's more to come -- the rat, after all, is still  abroad).  Thank you, Mrs. Rowling -- thank you, thank you, thank you.	2000-01-09

There's no more vastly experienced political journalist than Helen Thomas.  Nobody else can touch her for duration at  the White House and for personal, if not always flattering, attention from  eight presidents.  I agree with the poster who said that in places the  writing in this book is not as tight as it could be, but it didn't matter  to me -- the subject matter is as fascinating as can be, and I read the  book cover to cover with great enthusiasm.	1999-07-23

I'm with the minority in this review group -- the anticipation of this book was much greater than the satisfaction in the delivery.  I have been a big Elmore Leonard fan for a long time, but this one fell flat for me.  I  couldn't raise much of an interest in any of the secondary characters, and  somehow the story seemed to draaaaaaaaaaaaag and draaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaag and  draaaaaaaaaaaaaag from time to time.  Nobody can bat .400 every time -- I'm  looking forward to Elmore Leonard's next one.	1999-03-13

The  loneliness which an emerging gay personality must feel in the solitude that  characterizes most American farms must be overbearing at times.  A key  element in many of the stories told in this book is families which do not  and cannot understand homosexuality until it comes to roost at home.  Another is the strong religious background which many of the men have faced  and dealt with.  Not all of the stories end happily -- one of the men, for  example, committed suicide shortly after the interview with him was  completed.  But most of the tales are affirmations of personal confidence  and development, and they are bracing even to those of us who feel that the  best thing about the countryside is that it is possible to return to the  city from it, preferably immediately.  Will Fellows has added an important  contribution to gay male history, and he is to be highly praised for it.  Even greater praise, however, must go to the men who have forthrightly told  their tales, many of them reporting along the way that their communities  are still not aware of their sexuality.  That takes bravery, as does the  ability to look deeply into one's own life and background.  What a  wonderful book.	1998-09-06

Many reviews have  been written here on Amazon about &quot;Detective&quot;, and I'd just like  to write one observation.  I found the writing in &quot;Airport&quot;,  &quot;Hotel&quot; and other Hailey books to be somewhat leaden at some  points.  It brought to mind Rita Mae Brown, who is another of my favorites  and who tells magnificent stories, but whose writing seems clumsy at  points.  &quot;Detective&quot; is written much more smoothly, with more  highly believable dialogue and plot structure.  I read the book in one  afternoon and most of a Sunday, and I recommend it very, very highly.	1998-09-06
