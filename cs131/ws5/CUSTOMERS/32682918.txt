This book is a damning indictment of US foreign policy over the last sixty years or so, and how it may ultimately undermine this country if nothing is done to reverse the trend.  This is the dark underbelly of US relations with the rest of the world, one that every America needs to know.  Like his other book of essays, Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace, I cannot recommend this highly enough.	2003-12-04

Much of the book deals with Tim McVeigh and why he did what he did, and Vidal (who corresponded with him just before his execution) provides a much different picture of the man than was presented (a friend of mine had met with McVeigh once, and concurs with Vidal's portrait of the convicted bomber).  Perhaps the main thrust of this book is that these incidents were not isolated examples of lone nutcases, but symptoms of a much larger problem.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough.	2003-12-04

The action scenes were awkward, and there were a couple of howlers, especially at the beginning: rice cakes &quot;fatally impacting&quot; on the floor (pg. 8), a woamn eating a &quot;snowball-sized&quot; scoop of ice cream (pg. 63).<br />Some of the characters still were not fleshed out enough or totally believable-- Twain and Marin, for example.  There is actually the cliche of the serial killer listening to classical music at one point, something you see a lot of in movies but not in real life.<br />More than a few of the plot developments and incidents seem straight out of an action movie: the bad guys are always a step or two behind the good guys, a woman survives a gunshot when a bullet glances off her head (pg. 201), two people survive massive explosions that kill everyone around them (pg. 355), a man jumps out of the way of a bullet (pg. 377), the killer imbeds a knife in a cinderblock wall (pg. 333).  Other plot points are just ludicrous, as when one of the characters calls Stephen Hawking on the spur of the moment.<br />There are many more smaller problems which highlight his lack of research or inability to write about events in a believable manner, though it would be pointless to list them all.  Two thumbs down for me.	2003-11-30
US	32682918	R22PFNN8JQY6NK	0061012491	321782752	Rising Phoenix	Books	2	1	2	N	N	too much wish fulfillment, not enough hard reality	Rising Pheonix is an ambitious novel; unfortunately, it just doesn't have the ring of authenticity of, say, someone like Frederick Forsyth or Richard Herman, Jr.  I believe the problem is that the author is still too young and experienced to tackle the characters and subject matter and make the story real.  The characters aren't mature or complex enough, the locations don't come alive like they should, many of the descriptions are off-kilter, and events seem shoehorned into the story to make the plot work (Hobart's escapades in Colombia, especially, are hard to swallow).  Another major flaw is the fact that we get very little in the way of technical details, the nuts-and-bolts operations of the various organizations that come into play here.  When I read a political thriller, I want insight that encompasses the big picture, not endless details into the pointless quirks and habits of the characters.<br />But I think the main problem is that the basic premise is flawed.  To poison a large shipment of drugs would not solve the drug problem in this country-- too many addicts would keep using or switch to other drugs, and such a ploy would not bring the multi-billion dollar drug industry to its knees.  Not only that, we really don't get a sense of the huge tragedy that tens of thousands of drug deaths across the country would be (Noone who is rich and famous becomes a victim?  Hmmm.), not to mention the myriad social ramifications such an event would cause.<br />And finally, no FBI agent-- no matter how good he is-- would  accept a gift from a drug-dealing Mafioso, or he wouldn't last long with the Bureau.<br />Pet Peeve Dept: &quot;Ahold&quot; is not a word.	2003-11-27

On the surface, The Mood Cure looks pretty impressive, but a closer examination reveals many problems.<br />The mood questionaire at the beginning of the book is too broad and vague, and since a person's general mood can change from day to day depending on external circumstances, this can be difficult to assess.  Testing for allergies is also very difficult, as symptoms can vary greatly in variety and degree.  People can even have a positive reaction to a benign substance if they believe it is an allergen.  In any case, self-testing is not recommended.<br />Ross is also too critical of carbohydrates and vegetarian diets, and doesn't often make a distinction between whole grains and refined flour.  Conversely, she downplays the dangers of a high-fat high-protein diet.  Not only that, her comparison of diets today with diets 100 years ago is too broad and scientifically shaky.<br />Cautions about supplements are mainly relegated to the back of the book, and she advocates taking SAM-e and melatonin, both of which are largely untested regarding long-term effects (melatonin can have many short-term side effects, and sales are banned in Canada, France, and Britain).<br />Undocumented/unsubstantiated statements include:<br />28- the study in which a serotonin deficiency is created.<br />112- &quot;Take a look at the following sample menu.  The word that comes to mind is *satisfying!*&quot;<br />130- Hydrogenated fats are &quot;one step away from a plastic.&quot;<br />134- &quot;Fat really is jolly.&quot;<br />138- &quot;Casein can be as addictive as gluten.&quot;<br />154- &quot;I defy you to find more beautiful and cheery people than the Thai.&quot;<br />On page 45, she actually cites a study in which tryptophan cured depression in birds.<br />As if that wasn't enough, she even advocates pseudoscientific remedies such as homeopathy and blood type diets.  Lack of replication by others, and recent criticism of high-fat and high-protein diets in general does not bode well for this diet.  Proceed with caution.Proceed with caution.	2003-11-25

The characters are three-dimensional, and the plot is much more realistic.  Unfortunately, the writing prevents this novel from being anything more than mediocre.  When it doesn't rely on cliches, it is often clunky, especially in the dialogue (the killer actually says &quot;Tut, tut&quot; while lecturing to one victim).  Descriptions lack clarity and focus, or are just off the mark: a whip *blisters* the skin, a person's ribs *split* when kicked.  Ms Jackson also seems unclear as to exactly how a stun gun works, evidently believing you can zap someone just by pointing it at them.  This is too bad, since the killer's motive is rather interesting and believable.  Still, thumbs down for me.	2003-11-23

The actions of a psychopath abducting women, ripping them open, and drinking their blood take a back seat to a townful of physically perfect specimens pursuing their romantic interests to the exclusion of all else-- an FBI agent and a woman with three (!!) businesses, in particular, are two characters who don't seem burdened much at all with the responsibilities of their jobs--; in fact, all the characters are psychologically shallow, and this hideous crime spree really seems to make little impact at all in the daily lives of the townspeople.  Not only that, but the lack of details relating to basic police investigation  hides the fact that any reasonable attempt at solving the crimes would easily find the killer.<br />I know this is a novel of *romantic* suspense, but the killer only makes a cameo appearance every few chapters or so, and we get little sense of the horror of his crimes or the trauma suffered by his victims beyond some brief descriptions of his shocking acts which are totally out of sync with the rest of the story.  To make such gruesome acts a mere backdrop to the minor personal problems of others is psychologically dishonest at best and reprehensible at worst.<br />PS: Apparently the victim in the Prologue has no sternum or ribcage.	2003-11-20

It is just bad.  The details of the mental disorder that the killer suffers from are straight from a bad made-for-TV movie and have no relation to reality at all.  He even gets the name wrong, using a distorted form of the old label for this disorder.  To me, a good novel must first and foremost have decent psychology behind it, or else it doesn't work.  Even comic book and fantasy stories must be grounded in good psychology in order to work and create a connection to the reader.  To fudge on this undermines the story in a big way.  Maybe he could have gotten away with this if he had gone into the mind of the killer a little more, but he doesn't, probably so he could create some half-hearted red herrings in the first half of the novel.<br />Also, what I found even more bizarre than the events in the book was a three-page interview at the end between the author and his fictional detective (!?!?!?).  If an author wants to generate interest in a character, why not do it in the context of the novel itself?  Thumbs down for me.	2003-11-15

Though the premise was interesting (Mooney is very knowledgeable about technology), Mooney falls short in the psychology department.  His characters lack convincing depth and detail, and I felt like I was reading a novelization of a Hollywood movie.  The fact that he took a couple chapters to describe a parachute jump didn't help.  I just didn't feel it was worth the time and effort to slog through another 400 pages.	2003-11-10

Connolly has really outdone himself in creating a horrific narrative; in fact, a previous reviewer has said he is better than Stephen King, and I would certainly agree.  This is not a book for people who are looking for sunny affirmations-- or for those who are squeamish-- though the mood is lightened here and there by Connolly's wicked wit.  It starts with the discovery of a decades-old mass grave and a murder by spider and ends with a truly twisted description of a particular object being sought by the leader of a religious cult (I won't say anything more and spoil the surprise) and a showdown that is one of the grimmest I have ever read.  Even the very last lines of the novel, which normally would be seen as upbeat, carry ominous implications.  I could quibble about various aspects of the plot (How one individual was killed so easily, for example), but that would be emphasizing very minor details at the expense of all the is right about this novel.  Very well done and very highly recommended.<br />Note to Publisher's Weekly: It's &quot;grisly&quot;, not &quot;grizzly&quot;.	2003-11-10

The characters aren't as convincing as they could be (compare the FBI agents to those in Connelly's THE POET), especially the killer who, for the most part, remains just a shadowy figure throughout most of the novel.  The ending is fairly decent, but if only the rest of the novel had been as twisted and creepy as Chapter 24, he could have really had something.<br />PET PEEVE DEPT.: Add Mooney to the growing list of authors-- Michael Connelly, Christopher Reich, and Robert Walker among them-- who think &quot;ahold&quot; is a word.	2003-11-07

Yes, like other readers, I found it hard to believe that he hasn't spent his life living in the US.<br />Yet, there are some problems.  Mainly, there is probably too much detail-- so much so (particularly regarding all the murders) that, as I got further and further along, I almost felt like I had to take notes to keep track of all the people and events and the connections between them, not to mention the wealth of information about minor characters.  This also had the unfortunate effect of making the ending seem somewhat muted-- rather than gathering steam at the climax, one is relieved to see the novel finally coming to a close.  And yet, despite all this, the killer remains somewhat of an enigma-- we still don't really know why he did the things he did, or how (What made him become so psychopathic?  How did he find time to do all this and elude capture?  How did he hone his surgical skills?  Where did he get the barrels to put the victims in?  If the police had examined the initial suspect too closely, would they have discovered he was the wrong one?)  And finally, the Pet Peeve Department: It's &quot;doughnut&quot;, not &quot;donut&quot;.  Still, this is worth reading for the writing alone.	2003-11-02

How can a reader sympathize with a character who makes one stupid decision after another?  I constantly found myself thinking, &quot;No, don't do that,&quot; or &quot;Just leave well enough alone.&quot;  Hell, even Forrest Gump was able to learn from his experiences.  Another major flaw is the main character's motivation-- why jeopardize his career at a critical juncture to find a woman he doesn't even know?  Basically what is lacking is adequate psychological depth that would give this novel some real weight.<br />Other complaints:  1) There are way too many references to &quot;chasing the dime&quot; in the first quarter of the novel, 2) female characters and hit men are not Connelly's strong point, 3) the ending left some unanswered questions, and 4) everyone walks in at just the right moment to bring this novel to a tidy conclusion.

The opening scenes of McCaleb grudgingly accepting the case were a little too reminiscent of Will Graham in the beginning of Harris' RED DRAGON.  Also, McCaleb was too quick to accept Bosch as the killer of Gunn (If Bosch was the killer, why would he leave such elaborate clues pointing to himself?  And why didn't Bosch, or someone else, point this out to him?).  The ending wraps everything up a little too neatly and conveniently for my taste and, at 470 pages, this novel could probably have benefited from a little trimming here and there.  Finally, would the real killer(s) have had the intelligence and ability to concoct such an elaborate murder scene?  Not a bad novel, but not worthy of the high praise it has garnered.	2003-10-25

If this book doesn't provoke strong emotions in you, it is not the fault of the writer.  Though some have faulted the writing in this book, that is merely nit-picking and tends to ignore the worth of the bok as a whole.  My only complaint that she changed the names to protect the guilty, and that she forgave her abusers (who were still oblivious to the pain they had caused her) at a high school reunion.<br />Those who &quot;don't get it&quot; should consider these things: 1) Blanco had a strong family life which counter-balanced the abuse she suffered at school, 2)the fact that she has become a success in life does not invalidate her story; those who have suffered abuse often feel the need to overcompensate for their feelings of inadequacy; 3) success does not necessarily heal the wounds; victims of trauma invariably find themselves re-enacting stressful incidents in order to deal with them, 4) though the abuse she suffered may not have been as extreme as that suffered by others, it should be remembered that those who have suffered the most would not have been able to write something like this; teen suicide rates are very high, as is drug use and criminal behavior (perpetrators of school shootings are invariably the victims of long-term abuse).

What also hurts, but to a lesser degree, are the cliches that infect the second half of the novel-- the female FBI agent falling for the journalist, a nasty character and his comeuppance, etc.-- and one flaw that allows a too-lengthy showdown between the journalist and the suspect in a camera store.

I think the main problem is the way he deals with the serial killer-- with the author trying to keep his identity a secret, we never really get to know the charismatic psychopath, and he remains a background character, an enigma.<br />Second is the way the crimes are committed themselves.  That so many people would willingly let someone carve poems into their flesh, even after the bodies begin to pile up, is ludicrous.<br />There are other problems, too: too little forensic or investigative detail, characters that are caricatures, etc.  I read his first four or five Jessica Coran novels, and this is a big disappointment compared with those early efforts.	2003-10-17

Al-i Ahmad decries the current influence of the West at the expense of his own culture, in particular the economic and technological forces of global corporations which inevitably bring with it Western values and ideals.  Like Lewis, he is even-handed and level-headed in assigning blame.  That this book was suppressed during the Shah of Iran's reign is unfortunate indeed.<br />Though his history is a bit shaky (numerous footnotes correct various statements in the text), they are not fatal to his argument, and one cannot help but be swept up in his impassioned and eloquent defense of his culture.  Not only does he define the problem, but he offers practical non-violent solutions which, if they had been heeded when this book was first written (early 1960s), would have gone a long way toward preventing many of the problems the area faces today.<br />It should be noted taht a good background in Islam and Islamic history is necessary to fully grasp some of the finer points of his arguments.  But even without this background, it is essential reading for anyone wishing to understand why the U.S. is held with such low regard in the Arabic world.	2003-10-17

Masterton has a nice style of writing, and the details of Irish life, as well as the life of Detective Superintendent Katie Maguire and the bleakness of the story, were well conveyed.  However, the killer remained pretty much an enigma, and there is insufficient occult detail and atmosphere for this to really qualify as a horror novel.  The ending, while it delivered some neat surprises (including one involving The Lusitania which is particularly well done), did not carry sufficient weight for what is supposed to be an earth-shaking event, and left me feeling a little cheated and unfulfilled.  Masterton is a good writer, but his story needed a bit more work to be truly memorable.	2003-10-12

Lewis does a good job of detailing the various bones of contention, and spares no one in assigning blame to the current mess.  His outlook for the future is dire, indeed.<br />Like his previous book WHAT WENT WRONG?, THE CRISIS OF ISLAM packs a lot of information into a slim volume, yet suffers from being too sketchy at times, so that the reader unfamiliar with the finer details of Middle Eastern conflict is forced to do further research in order to understand his arguments.  It doesn't help that there is the occasional sentence that is awkward and unfocused.  Still, worthwhile for those looking for some background into the current Mideast situation.	2003-10-12

Up against a group of terrorists bent on  destroying a pleasure boat-- and its eight hundred passengers.&quot;), I was expecting an Alistair MacLean or DIE HARD kind of thriller.  Instead, I got an old school type crime novel that was popular up until the '70s; you know, the kind where the main character gets knocked around a lot, but not so bad that it can't be cured by a hot shower, an Ace bandage, and a slug of whiskey.  The terrorists are more of the home-grown Symbionese Liberation Army type, and the hit man doesn't even tangle with them until the last forty pages, or one-sixth, of the novel.  Not bad of its type, but not what I expected.	2003-10-07

The book would have benefitted from a glossary-- as he introduces many terms which he does not adequately explain--, and more examples and details to flesh out his analysis.  As informative as it was, the book left me wanting to know more, not necessarily a good thing.  I can't really fault him for numerous references that are both obscure and in other languages, but it left me frustrated that the book couldn't lead me to further explore this topic.  Still, as an introduction, it is for the most part a clear and concise introduction for those just learning about the historical background that has led to the present-day conflict between the West and Islam.	2003-10-06

Plot is almost non-existent, characters are cartoonish, and the occult details (for all her supposed research) are sparse indeed.  I read this in about two hours tops.  I can't imagine a mature adult enjoying this.  The other two in the series also get one star.  MERILYNN has the same problems as the first novel, and SAMANTHA has a better plot, but is undermined by silliness and some glaring errors in basic grammar and/or spelling.	2003-10-06

While his attempt was certainly laudable, the results are far from exemplary.  This novel is rather schizophrenic, as if a modern thriller had been transplanted onto a 1950s TV drama; I almost expected The Beav or Andy Griffith to step in and solve the whole thing.  The writing runs hot and cold, the characters are either squeaky-clean or evilevilevil, some of the characters' actions are questionable, and the attempts to work around offensive material are more often than not awkward.  His strong point is plotting-- in fact, there is probably enough plot for two or three thrillers.  There is so much that at times he is reduced to summarizing events instead of really getting into them in detail, despite the book's massive length.  For something like this to work, you need to have a lot of psychological depth.  An interesting read, no more.	2003-10-03

Philpin is a retired forensic psychologist who has been consulted on a number of criminal cases, and his knowledge shows-- the depth of psychological insight is, at times, amazing.  He even takes a few shots at FBI profilers.  You may find, like I did, that this is a hard novel to track down, but I would recommend that you do so, as it will be well worth the effort.	2003-09-13

No, on second thought, it is probably even better; this is the book Harris' HANNIBAL wanted to be.  One reviewer faulted the book for its abrupt ending; I didn;t think that was a problem, though I did think that the shifting first-person POVs was a little annoying at times.  Still, this is well worth hunting down and likely to shoot to the top of the list of your favorite crime novels.	2003-09-13

Like a lot of recent crime fiction, this one has a lot of twists and turns to keep you guessing, but for the most part, Philpin is able to keep his plot dead on target.  It reminded me a lot of, say, James Ellroy, though without his brooding sense of menace.  If the book has a fault, it is that the plot may be a little too clever for its own good and/or there is not enough insight into the killer's more recent state of mind.  Still, this is highly recommended.  I read his first three thrillers back-to-back-- a very enjoyable and rewarding week.	2003-09-13

This his humor can occasionally be off the mark (Cheerleaders in chadors?  What the hell was he thinking?!?!), more often tan not it is as on-target as a laser-guided missile, and I found myself laughing out loud at something in almost every chapter.  As good as the book is, though, I did have some reservations: 1) the Operation Chickenhawk chapter was way too obvious and heavy-handed, 2) unless you're really up on your current events, it may be hard at times to tell when he is joking and when he is relating a true incident, 3) there is no index, making it difficult to locate specific points in the book.  However, the chapter on the memorial to Paul Wellstone is deeply moving and more than makes up for it.  Very highly recommended.	2003-09-04

A young actress finds that a mysterious visitor appears in her apartment late at night, then, after a chance meeting at a bookstore, goes off to an isolated home in the country to live with a best-selling author, who keeps her prisoner and may or may not have some dark secrets he doesn't want revealed.  Along the way, the actress has to deal with a Planter's bag of assorted nuts, any one of whom may or may not be her mysterious visitor.  The plot takes its time to get where it's going, and the actress is oddly passive and accepting about these things most of the time.  I had made a mental list of things I found wrong with the book, but the ending answered just about all of them.  The author pulls off a nice trick ending-- just barely.  I think if he had re-worked this novel a little more, he could have had a dynamite thriller.	2003-09-04

Lebbon's writing vividly conveys a world turned upside-down by deadly apocalyptic dreams and nature gone berserk.  Unfortunately, the explanation for all these mysterious events is rather weak and mundane, and I was able to guess a good part of the ending 150 pages before it was explained.  It was like seeing the movie 2001, with the original ending replaced by the ending to 2010.  Still, I would recommend this novel for the vivid writing.	2003-08-28

Vorpagel presents a number of cases in which the crime scene is not always what it appears to be, and the unexpected (but plausible) explanations are more surprising than the rabbit-out-of-the-hat endings of 99.9% of crime fiction.  The story of the training exercise in Chapter 7 alone is worth the price of the book.  Highly recommended.	2003-08-28

The \\"science\\" and \\"science fiction\\" aspect, understandably, is given short shrift given that this is an erotic novel.  However, considering the fact that this novel deals with an S&M fetish, it was probably unwise to make these new host bodies very strong and give them a high pain threshold, vitiating much of the frisson that is de rigueur in S&M literature.  Related to this is the fact that the captive humans (their minds, anyway, as their original bodies have been discarded) do not seem unduly distressed at their state of captivity.  Not only that, there are just too many characters to keep track of.  If this were a movie, it would be directed by Andrew Blake, or be some soft-focus soft-core movie on some cable channel.	2003-08-28

There are also some fascinating anecdotes which reveal that some famous individuals may have had Asperger's-- Einstein, Wittgenstein, Andy Warhol, Andy Kaufman.  The book does have some minor faults, though: the writing is a bit confused in a few spots, forcing me to read carefully to try to figure out what exactly was going on, and she introduces terms without fully explaining them (\\"perseverating\\", for example).  The book, as wonderful as it is, it not as complete a guide for those looking for answers as I would have hoped.  For that, I recommend the excellent HITCHHIKING THROUGH ASPERGER SYNDROME by Lisa Pyles.	2003-08-28

The novel takes a while to get to where it's going, and there is very little that is truly convincing beyond the scene with the writer and the movie executive (not surprising, considering that Shirley is a screenwriter himself).  For a true taste of this writer's talent, read his collection Black Butterflies.	2003-08-14
US	32682918	R3SX1IG7FJOEZQ	0843948442	860935876	Black Butterflies	Books	4	4	4	N	N	disturbing	This book of short stories is divided into two sections, This World and That World, which deal with everyday horrors and otherworldly horrors respectively.  Of these two sections, the first is the most successful, which mostly involve the shocking realities of the underbelly of society, evoking a hybrid of John Rechy and Stephen King, and hitting you with the impact of a screwdriver to the kidneys (the best of these, &quot;Cram&quot;, will have you thinking twice about ever getting on the subway again).  The second section, comprising more outright horror, is less successful (By far the best of these is &quot;Delia and the Dinner Party&quot;).  Though Shirley is a very vivid writer, the shocks in these stories seem mostly arbitrary and forced compared to those in the first section.  Still worth checking out, though.  I also docked him some points for using rock lyrics as titles-- he's much too good a writer to be slumming like that.	2003-08-14

The characters are real, their feelings are dead-on, and the acts of the killer are horrifying yet believable.  The only caveat I have is the same one that other reviewers have voiced, and that is that it is very gruesome at times-- even as a male, I found the descriptions of the sexual torture and mutilation endured by the victims hard to take.  Still, this is a good debut, and I'm not sure how she will be able to top this.	2003-08-03

Aside from the fact that Billingham has made the goal of the serial killer slightly different than usual, and puts us into the head of an immobilized victim kept on life support, there is really nothing new here.  The frequent use of British slang and references to British pop culture may make it a bit difficult for the American reader, though I don't hold it against him.  The final chapter *is* heartbreaking, though, and is likely to haunt you far more than the rest of the novel.	2003-07-31

If the first book was a ride through the House of Horrors, this one is a trip through the House of Mirrors-- you are instantly plunged into a tale with so much evidence and so many twists and turns, trying to figure out where it is going is like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube.  Stick with it, though, as it all begins to sort itself out after 250 pages or so, and leads to a very satisfying conclusion.  I do have some minor complaints-- the detective seems almost psychic at times in the way he is able to put clues together or anticipate events, and how a person can shoot a gun (accurately) after having been shot in the arm himself seems a bit of a stretch--, but all in all this was a very satisfying thriller.  Recommended for those who like GORKY PARK-type novels.	2003-07-31

Will this book help make you a more popular person?  I suppose the basic flaw of any self-help book is that the reader can readily adopt the program of a book and find the on-ramp to the Highway of Success.  The first two sections of this book amount to little more than common sense in dealing with other people.  The final section, however, gives some fascinating insight into establishing rapport using Neuro-Linguistic Programming.  Boothman writes persuasively enough, but gives almost nothing in the way of solid scientific evidence for his program (At one point, he actually says, \\"In my opinion, and it has no scientific basis other than my close enough acquaintanceships with more than 35 couples . . .\\").  He also offers the surprising revelation that couples with successful relationships share not the primary sensory preference but the secondary one, yet gives little in the way of how to determine this secondary preference in others.  One might also wonder how to deal with seriously difficult people, skilled manipulators, or more than one individual at a time.  Perhaps in a sequel.  Still, this is better than most of what passes for self-help advice.<br />REVISED VIEWPOINT:  I've recently read a few books on autism and Asperger's Syndrome which revealed, among other things, that those afflicted do not respond to body language or voice tone, unlike most people, who use those as the primary means of determining a person's intention.  I also recently read John Philpin and Patricia Sierra's novel TUNNEL OF NIGHT (Philpin is a forensic psychologist, criminal profiler, and true-crime writer) in which it is stated that sociopaths who are aware of Neuro-Linguistic Programming can subvert it to deceive others.  I'm downgrading my rating from 4 stars to 2 stars.	2003-07-17

Unfortunately, her story is a fuzzy feel-good formula that could have benefitted from some solid background detail-- some more insight into government experiments on invisibility, whether scientific or pseudo-scientific, would have helped a lot.  And for all their expertise and high-tech gadgetry, the government agents are remarkably inept and slow-witted-- a little research into special forces training and government secrecy would have helped a lot here.  So if you're looking for believable characters and exciting chases, by all means read this novel.<br />Just don't examine the plot too closely.	2003-07-17

The premise of the novel is intriguing-- a decent cop who, through no fault of his own, brings misfortune to those around him.  I was hoping for some deep exploration into philosophy or religion, but was sorely disappointed when, instead, it turned into a routine cop story (albeit a rather decent one) and then a disaster story (!!).  Better writing and unexpected twists and turns made this an enjoyable read, but it lacked the profound exploration into the man's situation that I was looking for.	2003-07-10

I believe it's focus is too narrow-- it's missing a sense of international intrigue that you would get from a good spy novel, or a sense of awe that you would get from a novel that knows something about the occult.  In short, it needed to have opened up a bit more, to have a more global perspective on what are basically earth-shaking events.  It doesn't help that some of the action scenes are a bit awkward, either.  An adequate time-killer, nothing more.	2003-07-10

Authors Redfern and Roberts have done a masterful job of compiling government files, both British and American, about everything from UFOs to Spontaneous Human Combustion, shedding much light on what there governments really know (at least, based on files that were released to the public).  Though some mysteries are solved or, at least, given plausible explanations, others still remain up in the air (so to speak).<br />The book could have benefitted a little by being fleshed out with outside material.  The chapter on Men in Black is intriguing, but ultimately leaves some nagging questions.  And a few case histories from medical literature could have helped the chapter on spontaneous human combustion.  The section on UFOs is well done, but those looking for insights into Roswell, MJ-12, or the Rendlesham/Bentwaters incident will find nothing here (though, in all fairness, each of those topics have been the subject of numerous books of their own).<br />Despite these caveats, and the fact that this book will be disappointing to the hardcore conspiracy buff (who will, no doubt, distrust just about anything the government says), this book is highly recommended for those looking for solid answers based on genuine research and solid reasoning.	2003-07-06

What I got instead was a rather smart thriller that was more Alistair MacLean than Stephen King.  In fact, this was like a MacLean espionage thriller with quite a bit of Dean Koontz-like horror elements grafted onto it, as a research team attempts to uncover the mystery of the Loch Ness Monster, with various individuals attempting to sabotage the expedition.  A mysterious stone covered in runes also features into the story.  Though the writing is not quite polished enough to make it a must-read, and the novel is perhaps a bit too ambitious for its own good, those looking for something different and challenging should seek this out.	2003-06-20

Relentless gore-- a person or animal is disemboweled about every thirty pages with clockwork regularity.  Despite the onslaught of weird goings-on and the rash of mutilation deaths in this small town, the inhabitants do not seem unduly alarmed and, in fact, DO NOT EVEN TAKE ORDINARY PRECAUTIONS, resulting in people wandering around alone for a mysterious entity to kill them off one by one (!!!).  Is this normal in Britain?  I read the FORTEAN TIMES, which is full of inexplicable events, but they aren't so commonplace as to not raise an alarm, but I've never been to that country, so what do I know?  The fact that mysterious stone tablets seem to have unearthly (and possibly deadly) properties does not deter an archeologist from deciphering its ancient script.  There are also two or three false alarm scares, just like a bad horror movie.  On the plus side, Hutson only uses the word \\"fusty\\" once...	2003-06-17

This, his third novel, is a heady cocktail of Topping From Below, Les Liaisons Dangereuses, and Blood Simple, with a little Michael Crichton thrown in for good measure.  That he is able to pull it off is a tribute to his talent, and I found it to be an enjoyable roller-coaster ride from start to finish.  I don't want to give away any plot secrets, but I will say that this one will keep you guessing right to the end without sending the needle on your BS meter into the danger zone.  The only complaints I have (and they are relatively minor ones) are that the writing could have used an editing pencil here or there (there are some muddled metaphors and obscure references that had me scratching my head) and the character of Jerry was a little too naive and not as convincingly nerdy as he should have been.

True, Brooks can build believably complex characters, but the encounter session seminar thing was done to death in the '60s and '70s, and the conspiracy aspect takes a page or two from The Osterman Weekend and others of its ilk.  Plus, there are so many twists and turns in the novel, it was hard to tell who was getting jerked around more-- the participants of the seminar or the reader (hey, you can only pull so many rabbits out of the hat before the audience starts bolting for the exits).  Brooks also seems to tiptoe around plausible outcomes that would collapse his intricate plot like a house of cards (none of these executives don't seem to be able to think too far ahead), and some of the plot twists really push the credibility envelope (chapter 57, for example).  A final, somewhat minor complaint is his penchant for stringing together words in a I-want-to-be-precise-with-this-description fashion (Jeez, crack open a thesaurus!).  A decent beach read, nothing more.	2003-05-23
US	32682918	RDXXIGKD815P7	0679736301	353322797	Spider	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Spider weaves creepy tale of darkness	Reading this book, it is easy to see why Cronenberg decided to film it-- it takes place in the macabre world of the mind of a mentally deranged man, a schizophrenic who obsesses over the mysterious death of his mother.  Those looking for Stephen King-type thrills should look elsewhere, as this book's chills are much more subtle and realistic.  I haven't seen the movie yet, but if any filmmaker could capture the twisted gothic atmosphere of the book, it is Cronenberg.	2003-05-16

In fact, it is not even a good one.  The killer is not convincingly creepy, many of the police procedures are questionable, the action lacks suspense and strains credulity, and some of the characters border on stereotypes (the killer is physically deformed, the black hooker is straight out of a '70s exploitation movie).  The only interesting aspect of the novel was officer Courtney Bedell's relationship with her drug-addicted sister!  Were it not for this, the novel would be more reminiscent of bad pulp fiction from the '30s and '40s.  I had to force myself to read the last 100 or so pages.	2003-05-16

Her spare yet descriptive prose perfectly evokes the gothic tone of the deeds that connect the various characters.  The surprises come not in the plot but in the motives and backgrounds of the characters.  If there is any criticism, it is that she holds back too much, so that some scenes don't have quite the impact that they should, but this is a minor peeve.  I read this right after reading McGrath's SPIDER, and the two novels share a vague similarity in tone and subject matter.  Worth checking out.	2003-05-16

True, there are bursts of intense violence and daring, but this is novel is closer in spirit to Albert Camus or Graham Green in that it is an intense psychological study of a fanatical Marxist out to do real damage in French Algiers circa 1959-1960.  Some of the situations stretch credulity, but the atmosphere is vivid and convincing and the characters realistically disturbing.  There are even some debates about Marxism that are quite interesting and thought-provoking.  The ending, however, is a bit puzzling.	2003-05-10

Masson has gone back to original source material (and even discovered some documents long thought lost) to re-examine the story of Kaspar Hauser.  With his background in psychology, he was able to analyze the story like no previous writer had, and come to some surprising revelations, not the least of which Kaspar may well have been a member of German royalty, and was quite likely imprisoned and killed for just that reason.  Though I gave the book five stars, I do have some minor complaints: 1) Masson is a believer in Recovered Memory Syndrome, 2) he doesn't consider any physiological causes for Hauser's seeming lack of education and his subsequent steep learning curve (Charles Fort, oddly enough, is the only one to present convincing evidence that a bump on the head could have caused temporary amnesia, which then gradually receded as time went on), 3) he doesn't explain why Hauser was released from his imprisonment, especially after so many years, 4) Though he had asked a few pediatricians about the effects of long-term nutritional deficiences (Hauser supposedly subsisted on just bread and water), it is distressing that none of them could tell Masson anything specific (Just for the record, scurvy from Vitamin C deficiency, marasmus and hypoalbuminemic-type PEM (kwashiorkor) from too little protein and other nutrients, and rickets from Vitamin D deficiency, just to name some examples).  Still, this book is worth it just for the Introduction alone, and is likely to remain the definitive work on this mysterious child.	2003-04-24

Unfortunately, her plotting leaves a little to be desired.  In the first half, she relies way too much on luck and chance circumstances in having her reporter find out about criminal goings-on, and there are maybe one or two instances where the female reporter probably should've been killed, but made an almost miraculous escape.  I think Hamilton also plays many of her cards way too early, so that there are no big revelations at the end as there are in many crime novels, though the ending is somewhat effective in its own understated way.  And, to be really picky, there is a sentence or two that comes off a bit clunky.  Still, with a little more effort, she could probably join the ranks of Cornwell, Paretski, Reichs, et al.	2003-04-18
US	32682918	RKBFNF1PADO0G	0380779153	40083573	Forbidden Acts	Books	3	2	2	N	N	strong stuff	Many of these stories push the envelope of Nasty, and this anthology is not recommended for those with weak stomachs.  Some of them are absolutely gut-wrenching, like John Shirley's &quot;You Hear What Buddy and Ray Did?&quot; and Mike Lee's &quot;High Heels from Hell&quot;, while others are just disappointing (Rex Miller's &quot;Brainchild&quot;).  Very few are particularly distinguished, and I guess my favorite has to be Howard (The Turtles, Flo &amp; Eddie) Kaylan's &quot;The Energy Pals&quot;, which hilariously lampoons the Power Rangers/Ninja Turtles territory.  If you're looking for a few good nasty thrills, okay, but if you're looking for a great read, perhaps you might want to look elsewhere.	2003-04-18

Eye-opening, frightening, and dispiriting.  I do have some minor quibbles with it, though-- there is some repetition between the graphic novel and the written portion, and his characterization of the Afghanis themselves is sometomes contradictory.  Still, this is essential reading.  I've always hated the phrase, &quot;If you read only one book this year, make it this one,&quot; but in this case, it holds true.	2003-04-18

Had Mitchell the talent of Rechy, she could have prevented this story of modern-day vampires from coming across as so dull and--well-- lifeless (sorry).  This one doesn't even have the occasional S&amp;M scene to defibrillate the meandering plotline like Sips of Blood.	2003-04-10

Instead, Johnson delves into the history and practice of alchemy throughout the ages, and provides what is probably the clearest examination yet of the practice and purpose of this arcane art.  Johnson knows his stuff, and explores the psychological transmutations that result in the practitioners as well as the more well-known physical ones.  Is alchemy scientifically sound, and has it been unjustly ignored?  Who knows, but this book provides some intriguing food for thought.  Essential for students of the occult arts or even those with a conspiratorial bent.	2003-04-10

Pesce has been involved in the forefront of some of these advances, so he knows his stuff, and his enthusiasm for the potentials of this field is evident throughout the book.  If the book has a fault, it is that he downplays or ignores the dangers inherent in the use of this technology, e.g., what's to prevent someone from releasing \\"spy dust\\", or clouds of nano-cameras, into an area, or billions of nano-surgeons to lobotomize an entire population?  This book may be nothing new for those already immersed in the computer field, but for anyone else, it is required reading.	2003-04-10

Perhaps not even someone like Anita Shreve could have made this story fresh.  It didn't help that she held back on the sexual details, vaguely hinting at the horrors her female character was subjected to, or that the injuries she sustains at her new lover's hands are forgotten by the next chapter.  The story is partly redeemed by the last few chapters, specifically a friend's casual betrayal and the woman's final revelation (which barely escapes sounding contrived).  A good beach read, nothing more.	2003-04-04

I enjoyed reading this novel, all right-- parts are so bad they deserved to be enshrined in one of Pronzini's Gun In Cheek books.  To say that the psychology in this novel is sound is akin to saying that an abandoned shack in the woods would pass building code inspection.  And I'm not even factoring in Brown's homophobia (which, even as a straight guy, I found annoying) or the fact that a chronic alcoholic-- I'm sorry, _heavy drinker_-- could function as well as this reporter does.  The ending, in which the reporter keeps the killer at bay (for several hours!) is deliciously bad in the best tradition of wretched pulp fiction.  I recently read a few W. R. Burnett novels (Little Ceasar and Asphalt Jungle) which were written a decade or two before this but hold up a lot better.  Brown has written some good stuff, but this novel doesn't deserve its &quot;classic&quot; status.	2003-04-04

On the plus side, I can't remember the last time when I enjoyed a book just for the sheer mastery of its writing.  On the negative side, this story will be nothing new to anyone who has read science fiction in the last thirty or forty years.  In fact, the aliens don't seem that advanced intellectually or psychologically, and the writer glosses over some major plotholes (e.g., how do the aliens escape detection, especially over such a long period of time?).  If this is meant as satire then, well, I guess I don't really get it.  Perhaps next time he'll find a story equal to his talents.	2003-03-27

The first half, a gritty no-punches-held crime drama, is dynamite as it introduces the characters and sets up the inevitable conflict, even if the science is a bit shaky in spots.  Unfortunately, somewhere about the halfway point, it starts to head south, and it turns into a hybrid sci-fi/James Bond thriller totally at odds with what came before; some reviewers on this page have likened it to a comic book, and I have to admit I agree.  A scientist's puppy-dog infatuation with his female boss does not help matters any, either.  Still, it's a nice thrill ride if you can suspend your disbelief.<BR>NOTE: It seems those who love Brown's other books hate this one, and vice versa.	2003-03-27

There is also a neat little plot twist about halfway through (which I won't give away).  Unfortunately, we really don't get any sense of depth in any of the characters, particularly the evil woman (I kept thinking what Jim Thompson or Herbert Kastle could have done with this story), and the killer's fear of spiders does not appear to have any logical psychological explanation other than to serve as a plot device.  I also felt that there was way too much emphasis on race relations (a little subtlety in this department would have gone a long way, rather than bludgeoning the reader over the head with it for several pages).  One review on the back of the paperback says Hoffman writes lean, mean prose; to me, Andrew Vachss writes lean, mean prose, which is a razor blade compared to Hoffman's steak knife.  Overall, a C+.	2003-03-13

The villain, Dr. Goslar, is one of those all-powerful shadowy figures usually seen in pulp fiction (e.g., Fu Manchu).  If he is so powerful and such a threat with some new biological weapon, why are there only a few agents attempting to bring him down?  And why does Goslar fail again and again to kill them?  There is also a plot twist involving sisters which I saw coming at least three hundred pages early.  Weak, especailly when stacked up against say, Frederick Forsyth or Andy McNab.	2003-03-02

The events may be dated slightly, but this is still a top-notch techno-thriller.  I don't know who Larry Bond is, but he can move effortlessly from the political infighting in Washington to the grim realities of modern-day warfare on the battlefield to the reactions of Communist leaders.  Even at 700 pages, it moved at a brisker pace than many novels half the size.  He's included maps and Dramatis Personae but, to be honest, the characters and situations are so vivid, these are hardly even needed.<BR>Nitpicking Dept: He occasionally throws in a military and/or slang word which he doesn't define.  There were one or two instances where individuals got too lucky in escaping dangerous situations which stretched credulity.  His writing is good, but occasionally doesn't quite convey battle scenes as vividly as it should.  Overall, though, on a scale of 1 to 100, I would give this novel a solid 97.  Should be required reading for anyone concerned about the current political situation.	2003-03-02
