These are the folks whose hard work, understanding and fertile imaginations make life bearable for all of us.  They are the people who have (so far) ensured that the machine doesn't stop.  Without their dedication to their work, we might all be back to chipping spearheads from flint and fishhooks from antler & bone.	2005-06-06

I work in statistical data analysis, and I opened this book with high expectations.  But then on page 6 I encountered Figure 1.1, titled \\"Stock Prices and Earnings, 1871-2000\\", which has a visual design that troubles me.  Both lines on the graph are plotted with the same x axis (the years from 1860 to 2020), and I have no problem with that.  The Stock Price line is plotted against a y axis that is labeled along the left-hand edge of the graph, and the range chosen for this axis (0 to 1600) seems quite appropriate for the data plotted, which range from about 70 to about 1450.  The Stock Earnings line is plotted against its own y axis that is labeled along the right-hand edge of the graph, and I have no problem with the existence of the second y axis.  But what troubles me is that the range of this second y axis has been chosen so that the entire range of the data plotted in the earnings line (about 5 to about 40) has been squished into the very bottom of the graph, using a vertical distance that corresponds roughly to the range from 2 to 190 on the y axis for Stock Price.  This apparently arbitrary visual juxtaposition of two unrelated y-axis scales leaves me unable to trust any visual trend comparisons I might be tempted to make between the two lines.  Can someone explain to me why one of these three alternatives that make more sense to me wasn't chosen?  (1) Plot both the Stock Price and the Stock Earnings on the same y-axis scale (from 0 to 1600), or (2) plot the Stock Price on its own y axis as shown but plot the Earnings Price on a y axis that runs from 0 at the bottom of the graph's right-hand edge to about 45 on the graph's right-hand edge, or (3) normalize both graphs to percentages of their values for some year (1871, perhaps).  Thanks.  Any comments from Edward Tufte (\\"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information\\") would be most welcome indeed.	2005-04-26

It represents a throwback to the xenophobic attitudes of California's 1920s.<br />First, a clarification:  I am an Anglophone with mostly Northern European roots who grew up in Southern California, and I worked alongside Mexican immigrants (both documented and undocumented, both citizen and non-citizen) in San Diego County's orange groves and Christmas tree farms when I was in high school.  Today I'm an engineer.<br />These were honest men, working hard to support their families. Some of them had their families here; others' families were still back home in the hardscrabble villages where they grew up.  Their story, if you look at it closely, is remarkably similar to the stories of the poor-but-honest English, German, \\"Scotch-Irish\\" (actually uprooted Scots Borderers, mostly via Ulster), Irish, Chinese, Scottish, Swedish, Norwegian, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Korean, Basque, Jewish, Philippine and Portuguese immigrants who have come here, worked incredibly hard in the face of fierce resentment from those whose forebears had arrived before they did, and grown to be full members of the community within a couple of generations.  Like the rest of us, they are in the main healthy, hardworking, ambitious human beings searching for a chance to earn a better life for their children; like so many of our own ancestors, they are finding that a lot of folks who were born here in the Promised Land have conveniently forgotten their own recent immigrant heritage.  (The supreme irony, of course, is that so many of the recent immigrants from Mexico can actually claim hundreds of generations longer ancestry in this hemisphere than most of the rest of us can.  And yet we feel justified in calling _them_ interlopers.  But I digress.)<br />Victor Hanson's \\"Mexifornia\\" reminds me most of a shocking piece of period racism I've been working my way through lately. It's an odd little popular novel from about 1919 I found in a thrift store.  Written by Peter B. Kyne (a resident of San Francisco at the time) and titled \\"The Pride of Palomar\\", it is set on a fictional rancho somewhere south of Santa Barbara, and it drips with venomous attitudes toward all non-Anglo ethnic groups.  The protagonist is a part-Irish, part Castillian-caballero rancher who sees the \\"yellow peril\\" in Japanese truck farmers, indolent laziness in his father's Native American retainers, refined laziness and financial foolishness in his Californio forebears (including his own father), and a dangerous hot temper as the legacy of his Irish paternal great grandfather.  He sees his own education in hyper-efficient \\"American\\" farming methods at Davis as the wave of the future, and verbally blasts all who get in his way.  He is early twentieth-century American jingoism personified, and he is a very uncomfortable character for me to read about.<br />I thought he and his type were firmly in California's past, until I stumbled upon Professor Hanson's diatribe.  I was wrong.  I find little to distinguish between the attitudes of Peter B. Kyne and those of Victor Davis Hanson.e.  Written by Peter B.

But it's extremely improbable that a Navy SEAL would be an effective nuc-boat skipper. Even Navy fighter pilots selected for a path to commanding a nuclear powered aircraft carrier find mastering the intense math, chemistry and physics necessary to understand nuclear propulsion to be a nearly impossible task. God help the ground-pounder/swimmer who tries to do the same in the nuclear submarine force.  Nuc boat skippers have to understand everything about the boat and its power plant, 'way down into the nitty, gritty, quantum-mechanical detail, thermo-goddammics and all, so they know what risks they can take with the boat and what risks it won't survive.  It isn't enough just to know what test depth is, believe me.  There are lots and lots of other subtle mistakes that will also let gobs of water into the people tank and keep the ship from making it through a mission.  And--believe it or not--the Navy tends to select nuc boat skippers chiefly for their ability to accomplish the mission without loss and bring that extremely expensive chunk of cold iron (or titanium) home in one piece, so it can be used again for another mission, even in wartime.  Which is why there are SEAL Team Leaders and there are nuc-boat captains, and the Nav isn't about to let the the same individuals try to be both.  Pure pragmatism.<br />Being a SEAL and being a nuc boat skipper demand two very different--and nearly incompatible--skill sets.  Trying to mix them in the same character undermines this book's credibility.	2002-11-07

Mistakes permeate popular science expositions of evolutionary biology. Mistakes even filter into biology journals and texts. For example, Lodish, et. al., in their cell biology text, proclaim, \\"It was Charles Darwin's great insight that organisms are all related in a great chain of being...\\" In fact, the idea of a great chain of being, which traces to Linnaeus, was overturned by Darwin's idea of common descent.<br />Misunderstandings about evolution are damaging to the study of evolution and biology as a whole. People who have a general interest in science are likely to dismiss evolution as a soft science after absorbing the pop science nonsense that abounds. The impression of it being a soft science is reinforced when biologists in unrelated fields speculate publicly about evolution.<br />This is a brief introduction to evolutionary biology. I attempt to explain basics of the theory of evolution and correct many of the misconceptions.<br />What is Evolution?<br />Evolution is a change in the gene pool of a population over time. A gene is a hereditary unit that can be passed on unaltered for many generations. The gene pool is the set of all genes in a species or population.<br />...<br />*/	2002-09-30

I've read most of the reviews posted here.  This one hits the mark and splits the apple, clearly exposing Phillip Johnson's intellectual bankruptcy.  <br />/*<BR>The Wedge Of Lies and Deceit Pertaining to Science, April 17, 2002<br />[Top 500 Reviewer] Reviewer: John Kwok from New York, NY<br />The WEDGE OF TRUTH, Phillip Johnson's latest attack on evolutionary biology - and by implication, therefore, all of science - is replete with factual omissions, distortions and sarcastic commentary on &quot;naturalistic&quot; science which I've unfortunately read elsewhere, most notably in DARWIN ON TRIAL. Once more Johnson deplores the fact that science refuses to consider supernatural explanations as part of its very essence; he refuses to acknowledge that scientists have good, sound reasons based on logic and rationalism to exclude the possibility of supernatural explanations for natural phenomena. Johnson argues that those who subscribe to &quot;naturalistic&quot; Darwinian evolutionary biology must inevitably be opposed to religion; however, I know of at least two prominent biologists who see no conflict between their own devout personal beliefs in a Judeo-Christian GOD and their research in biology. Johnson fails to acknowledge the signficance of important evolutionary biological research by scientists such as Peter and Rosemary Grant; once more he dismisses the significance of their research on Galapagos finches, which does demonstrate convincingly the importance of natural selection as the primary mechanism behind microevolution. (Indeed, he fails to acknowledge important recent research cited by Kenneth Miller in Miller's book FINDING DARWIN'S GOD which demonstrates recent speciation via microevolution.)<br />Phillip Johnson claims that evolution isn't a natural law of science such as gravity. However, I wonder whether his ill-conceived logic might also account for other natural laws like gravity and the speed of light. Couldn't one say that these are due to an &quot;Intelligent Design&quot; devised by some omniscient CREATOR? Surely sciences such as physics, chemistry and geology ought to fall under the rubric of &quot;Intelligent Design&quot; theories, allowing for the possibility of supernatural events. Yet would these be considered science still, not metaphysics? Surely Johnson's call for &quot;theistic science&quot; only proves his lack of understanding - or rather his unwillingness to understand - how and why science must remain a rational enterprise devoid of supernatural explanations. <BR>*/	2002-09-30

Robinson does his homework and writes well. I read this book several years ago, and it sparked my long-term interest in reading about Freemasonry's verifiable origins. Recently, this led me to read 'The Origins of Freemasonry: Scotland's Century, 1590-1710', by David Stevenson, which I now recommend more highly than 'Born in Blood'.<br />'Scotland's Century' is the only work on the origins of Freemasonry I have ever seen that ignores the movement's vast myth-making literature and focuses instead on the surviving records of the earliest known Masonic lodges. Stevenson--who teaches history at the University of St. Andrews--paints a solid, sober, believable portrait of Freemasonry's rather prosaic origins in the operative masonic lodges of early 17th-century Scotland.<br />Stevenson's book is a welcome and refreshing antidote to all the junk that has been written about Freemasonry in the past three centuries. It explodes Masonic authors' extravagant claims for an origin in ancient civilizations and possession of powerful supernatural secrets. It also undermines anti-Masonic authors' equally bizarre accusations of pacts with supernatural forces of evil. It replaces these fanciful images with the story of a remarkable human institution whose recent, humble, workaday origins are far more interesting than its myths.<br />'Born in Blood' is lots of fun to read, and I still recommend it highly. But the tale told in 'Scotland's Century' is probably a lot closer to what really happened.	2002-08-21

Page-check your copy before you pay for it, tho	This is a terrific book, but I'm going to have to find another copy before I can read Chapter 15 (Radioactive Heat and Convection).  My copy suffers from a serious bookbinding error, in which pages 197-228 are missing and pages 165-196 are repeated.  (The second page 165 follows the first page 196, and page 229 follows the second page 196.)<br />I also have a couple of nits to pick that I would have expected the editors at Oxford University Press to catch before the book reached print.<br />(1) Early in the book, Homer and Ulysses are referred to in a sequence of two sentences which suggests that Ulysses was a character in Homer's work, which he wasn't.  Ulysses stars in Virgil's Latin epic &quot;The Aeneid&quot;, which borrows heavily from Homer's Greek epic &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, starring Odysseus.  So the discerning reader is left not knowing whether the subsequent quotation is from Homer's Odyssey or from Virgil's Aeneid.<br />(2) Early in the book, the assassination of Julius Caesar is referred to as the death of the Romans' emperor.  But Julius Caesar was never emperor.  He was assassinated to prevent him from becoming king.  His adopted son Octavian invented the title of emperor (&quot;imperator&quot; = commander) years later--specifically to avoid offending the Romans' aversion to kings--when he had defeated his own rivals and had assumed absolute power in Rome as Caesar Augustus.<br />(3) The conversion from a temperature _difference_ of 3 Celsius degrees into a temperature _difference_ of 37.5 Fahrenheit degrees is completely wrong.  It incorrectly includes the 32-Fahrenheit-degree offset for the freezing temperature of water (32F = 0 C), which isn't involved at all in a temperature-difference conversion.  The correct conversion is to a temperature difference of 5.5 Fahrenheit degrees.  The conversion of a Celsius temperature _level_ to a Fahrenheit temperature _level_ on the same page is done correctly, however.  I suspect that the erroneous conversion was done by a literary editor who wasn't as familiar with temperature scales as I am sure the author must be.<br />But these are minor (though annoying) editorial flaws in a well-written, enlightening book.

When I was in my early teens, I read nearly everything Heinlein had written up to that point. The themes of 'The Moon is a Harsh Mistress' (&quot;TANSTAAFL&quot;) and Starship Troopers (citizenship must be earned)  are among those I still remember most vividly.<br />These themes led me to  follow Heinlein's own example, and choose the Navy when I faced the war in  Vietnam and the draft lottery at age 19.  Left-handed, non-athletic and  somewhat solitary, I'd have made a terrible cap trooper and an even worse  Marine.  But I did okay in submarines.  Today I wear a ponytail and work in  software, and my politics have swung leftward to cross the centerline.  But  I still agree with the basic premise of Starship Troopers: while the  &lt;&lt;opportunity&gt;&gt; to earn full citizenship must be open to all,  there is a lot to be said for expecting people to earn their right to hold  elected office in some fashion.<br />As a Heinlein character points out in  Starship Troopers, military service needn't be the only means of earning  this right.  The key is for each candidate to have first spent significant  time and effort contributing individually--and at some level of personal  sacrifice--to the well-being of the nation and its people. To extend  Heinlein's list of citizenship paths somewhat, I would add the following  examples:<br />- service in VISTA or the Peace Corps<br />- full-time service in  an American Red Cross disaster relief unit<br />- as a full-time mother,  successfully raising one child through completion of high school with a B  average, no suspensions, and no arrests<br />- full-time practice as a  certified health-care professional (physician, registered nurse,  pharmacist, etc.) providing low-cost service to under-served populations  (examples include both inner-city and rural communities)<br />- full-time  service as a certified public-school teacher, guidance counselor or  principal in under-served rural or inner-city communities<br />- full-time  service as a policeman, sheriff's deputy, state trooper, community  corrections officer, prison psychologist, or Child Protective Service  officer<br />- military service in the Army (including the Corps of  Engineers), Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps or Coast Guard, or any of their  reserve or National Guard units<br />- full-time service in the Environmental  Protection Agency, in the NOAA uniformed service, as a ranger in the  National Park Service or the USDA Forest Service, or in a similar  public-service conservation role<br />- full-time public service to  under-served communities as a registered professional engineer (P.E.),  working to improve water, waste disposal, public utility and transportation  systems<br />There could be many more such paths to an earned citizenship, but  Heinlein's basic premise that it should be earned is still worth  investigating.<br />It's also worth noting that all four of the upcoming  presidential election's currently credible candidates have--each in his own  way--met Heinlein's minimum criteria for full citizenship.  Alphabetically:  Bradley was in the Air Force Reserve; Bush served as a pilot in the Air  National Guard; Gore served as an enlisted Army journalist in Vietnam; and  McCain's service as a Navy pilot included several years as a prisoner of  war in Vietnam.

This book traces the early development of modern thought in pre-Union Scotland.  It shows clearly that John Napier (1550-1617), the Scots laird and mathematician who invented logarithms and introduced the decimal point  in writing numbers, was not a solitary light in the Scotland of wild  savages so often portrayed in English historical works.  Rather, he was  part of a much more broadly based movement of Scots intellectual progress  that also included the invention of Freemasonry.<br />The Seattle public  library system now has a copy of this excellent work of intellectual  history.<br />-dubhghall	1999-09-17

If this book had been split into two separate books, I believe the author could have achieved both of her apparent objectives.<br />One of the books could have focused on the topic indicated by its title, which would have  met the expectations of the mainstream audience that chiefly wants to learn  about Dr. Pert's discoveries and understand their implications for our own  emotional wellbeing.<br />The other book could have focused on the grim  realities of how cutting-edge biomedical research is done in places where  our best and brightest are forced to compete nastily for their slices of an  abysmally small federal health-science research budget.  This second book  could have noted the much larger sums provided to nearby Pentagon agencies  whose direct contributions to human health are somewhat less obvious.  It  could then have used the author's own experiences at work in the resulting  cutthroat research culture to illustrate the damage done by this approach  to government (under-) funded science.	1999-08-20

This is a vivid, thoroughly researched portrayal and analysis of the colonial revolutions that DIDN'T succeed, a full century before the one that did.<br />They're nearly forgotten today, but Bacon's Rebellion in  Virginia and Maryland, King Philip's War in New England, and the deadly  struggle for control of the Hudson River's highway to the fur trade moulded  the destiny of England's colonies in North America.<br />17th-century  adventure themes made familiar in 'Peter Pan' jump from every page.  The  cast of characters includes a brash young adventurer from London who  refuses to grow up, brilliant Iroquois diplomats and desperate Algonquin  warriors on silent forest paths, impromptu private navies on the  Chesapeake, and corrupt, aging braggarts who will stop at nothing to  preserve their fading local empires.<br />Overshadowing all of these is a  swashbuckling, cash-hungry king (along with his ruthless brother the Duke  of York), bent on achieving financial independence from Parliament by  establishing a profitable overseas empire.  The English Civil War and  Cromwell's decade in power are firmly in the past and the royal brothers  are fully in command in 1676, when these New World crises provoke them into  military action that abruptly closes a generation of benign neglect and  colonial self-rule.<br />If you have ever been curious to find out why the  Revolution of 1776 really happened, then you will enjoy this book.  In the  1770s, these crushed colonists' direct descendants (who included George  Washington) showed that they had learned well the bitter geopolitical  lessons of the 1670s.<br />It's not light reading, but it is compelling,  memorable and satisfying.

Like Tolkien's 'Smith of Wootton Major', the quiet, honest, caring folk who inhabit the foreground of Zenna Henderson's stories live simply and try to accept life as they find it.  These traits help them keep their balance  and act compassionately when they find out that they have vulnerable  neighbors who must live with care on the boundary between vastly different  worlds.  This is perhaps best illuminated in the personal struggle of the  primary-grades teacher who encounters 'The Anything Box' in one such  child's hands, right there in her otherwise-ordinary classroom.  Set in the  arid Southwest of the late 1940s, these stories are both timeless and  contemporary, both exotic and immediately familiar to anyone who has been a  first-grader in 20th-century America.

More than any other I have found, this book brought Isaac Newton to life:  as a brilliant human being, but still just a human being, with as broad a spectrum of flaws, quirks and vulnerabilities as any of us have.  It shows  him more as some of his contemporaries may have seen him, before the  publication of the Principia began to transform him into a shining demigod  of the Enlightenment.  It does shine a light on his admittedly obsessive  (but still sensible, focused, meticulous and sincere) investigations of  theological and alchemical claims that mattered greatly to his generation.  Many of these investigations proved to be fruitless, but that does not  diminish the man.  For these claims lost much of their interest to later  generations precisely because the new analytical tools that Newton  published in the Principia enabled revolutionary advances in physical  knowledge that rapidly pushed alchemy and theology onto the sidelines of  intellectual history.<br />Truly a wonderful, balanced and satisfying  collection of essays, each written by an expert in  a particular  perspective on Newton's life and work.  I would welcome publication of  similar collections of lucid, expert essays on Robert Boyle and Charles  Darwin.	1999-06-11

The narrative pace is Scott's, not ours, so Rob Roy requires some patience and a locale that encourages reflection.  For readers in the Pacific Northwest, I would recommend reading it among the crags at Hidden Lake  Lookout.<br />A point of clarification:  while the film versions of Rob Roy  and Braveheart may be of similar vintage, they definitely do not portray  the same eras in Scots history.<br />The Highlander gentleman outlaw and  cattle thief Robert MacGregor (Rob Roy) lived from 1671 to 1734, during the  transition from Stuart to Hanoverian Britain that shed so much Highlander  blood.  Rob Roy's life was roughly contemporary with that the Old Pretender  (James Francis Edward Stuart, 1688-1766), the &quot;King Over The  Water&quot; of many a Scotsman's toast.  His lifestyle was much like that  of the fictional Doone clan in R. D. Blackmore's novel Lorna Doone, which  is set in southwest England of the 1670s and 1680s:  deprived of their own  estates by wars and legal chicanery, both the Doones and the MacGregors  lived by stealing livestock and preying upon the surrounding  countryside.<br />William Wallace (&quot;Braveheart&quot;) lived (1270-1305)  and fought much earlier in Scots history, in the times of Edward I  &quot;Longshanks&quot; (1239-1307) and Robert I &quot;the Bruce&quot;  (1274-1329), kings of England and Scotland, respectively.<br />In a  nutshell, &quot;Braveheart&quot; provides the background for Robert the  Bruce's victory at Bannockburn, while &quot;Rob Roy&quot; sets the stage  for the Duke of Cumberland's dragoons' massacre of Highland Scots at  Culloden Moor, which crushed Bonnie Prince Charlie's uprising of 1745.<br />&quot;Braveheart&quot; lies at the beginning, and &quot;Rob Roy&quot; at  the end, of several centuries of Scottish self-rule.<br />-Doug Johnson	1999-04-27

It challenges the reader to reconsider the assumption that each person's &quot;self&quot; is a single, indivisible entity.  The author illustrates this challenge with simple, clear  perception experiments that suggest plausible (but radical) changes to our  working model of the human mind.  The book's best feature is that it  successfully resists any temptation the author may have felt to speculate  beyond the evidence at hand.

It  looks like a great deal of fun, but it would have to replace one of the  absorbing obsessions I already have (like playing better chess and writing  more efficient S code), and I'm just not willing to do that.<br />Yet.	1999-04-18

I read Sholokhov's 'And Quiet Flows the Don', Pasternak's 'Doctor Zhivago', Tolstoi's 'War and Peace', and Solzhenitsyn's 'First Circle' in the early 1970s.<br />The others were indeed memorable, but 'the Don' is burned into my mind's eye.<br />It paints a searing portrait of a vast, unforgiving steppe--then tears across it on horseback, leaving great waves of ethnic, political and personal upheaval in its wake.<br />I still smell the wheatfields in the wind and taste the black dust on my lips from the opening chapter.<br />I see villagers storm the home of one of their own and destroy his outlander wife for her foreignness.<br />I see an unhorsed cavalryman struggling to remove his bright blue Cossack breeches before capture in one of the Great War's opening battles with Austria, only to be plucked from danger at the last moment by the young Cossack who had stolen his wife before the war.<br />I hear the stolen woman, now become a fiery mistress, sobbing her heart out when the man whose child she bore leaves her at last for his own wife.<br />And after the firing squad's last volley in the closing chapter, I see a proud, condemned Cossack biting fiercely into his own shoulder, to make no sound as his blood pours out and stains the black steppe red.<br />In a quarter of a century, I still have not read a more powerful novel.	1999-04-14
US	50957704	R3W2MXGF3QIRMI	0440178002	191357398	Shogun (Asian Saga)	Books	5	5	6	N	N	The lord of the Kwanto pins the queen's navigator at 140E	I read _Shogun_ as a young naval officer, while my submarine was in drydock for a year-long refueling overhaul, five years after I spent a summer learning celestial navigation and piloting aboard a sailing ship.<br /><br />It is still one of the three most memorable novels I have ever read.<br /><br />I was riveted by its portrayal of the bond among members of the  Elizabethan era's tiny brotherhood of truly competent deep-ocean  navigators.  As this story unfolded, the phrase \\"brother to  corsairs...\\" came alive for me as it never has before or since.<br /><br />In  1600, when reliable measurement of longitude was still several generations  in the future, an experienced voyager and shipwright who knew the latitude  of The Lizard (for example) was worth many times his weight in gold to any  nation.  Pinning down a world-class navigator, as Toronaga does in  _Shogun_, could give a leader a tactical advantage similar to the pinning  of a well-placed knight in chess. Demonstrating mastery of the closely  guarded lore of global navigation to a fellow pilot could also inspire his  instant friendship and a claim on his aid when in danger far from home.<br /><br />As they built upon the great tradition of Magellan and El Cano, plus Drake, Cavendish and the other English \\"sea dogs\\",  captain-pilot John Blackthorne of the Erasmus and the Portuguese  captain-pilot of the Black Ship inspired far more awe in me than did any other figure in this novel.<br /><br />Often overlooked, this subtle thread in Clavell's masterpiece is what holds the entire tapestry together.  Without the navigators' courage and skill, the Portuguese Jesuits, Spanish  Dominicans, Dutch Calvinists and Japanese samurai in this masterful tale of religious and political intrigue would have lived out their lives in complete ignorance of one another.	1999-04-04

Ironically, it sent me scrambling to learn more about  William of Ockham, the Franciscan at Oxford whose 14th-century critique of  Aquinas' universals so irritated the Pope at Avignon.  &quot;The Name of  the Rose&quot;  is set in Ockham's lifetime (~1285 to ~1350) and features  an English-born and observant Franciscan who is also well versed in logic,  so it looks to be a good next read.  I found the film to be entertaining  (oh, that Sean Connery!) but thin.  However, these reviews lead me to  believe that I will find the book quite absorbing.  Thanks for the reviews!	1999-04-04

Yes, there are four narrators, and yes, each resolves several mysteries then puts down his pen, sure that he has the truth.  <br />You can do this too, starting with &quot;Who did in the dotty don?&quot; &quot;Who was a  murderer?&quot; &quot;Who WAS that woman?&quot; and &quot;Who among these  writers (if any) was quite thoroughly daft?&quot;  <br />Don't expect a neatly  wrapped conclusion:  you won't find it.  Expect instead to argue long and  hard with all of the narrators and all of the reviewers, long after you  finish the book.  Expect also to wish you knew a lot more about early  Restoration England and the history of modern science than you do now.	1999-03-24
