Players' names are misspelled, keystroking errors abound, sentences are left  incomplete, and whole sections are repeated or placed out of proper  sequence in the stats section. An atrocious editorial job which did not  serve this author well. And who ever came up with the idea that a  &quot;Dodgers Encyclopedia&quot; should include portraits of many figures  (James Creighton and Candy Cummings e.g.) and events (1858 series between  Brooklyn All-Stars and Hoboken All-Stars) connected with diamond history in  the New York borough, but completely unrelated to the NL ballclub (while at  the same time skipping over numerous substantial LA Dodgers figures)? Along  with the signing of Kevin Brown as franchise savior, this tome is one of  the  distinct disappointments of recent Dodgers history.	2000-04-19

In the months that have passed since the publication of RGE's monumental book on Cuban baseball history the nature and value of his work has slowly come more clearly into focus. The dedicated scholar-author is to be praised  for his valuable contribution in providing rich detail on the early years  of Cuban baseball not found in other English-language sources. But as David  Skinner has pointed out in a recent on-target review in the scholarly  journal NINE (Canadian Scholars' Press), Professor Gonzalez has throughout  engaged in a good deal of mythmaking of his own. While RGE provides many  delighful nuggets about early Cuban baseball and Negro league barnstorming  on the island, and while he also does service for monolingual baseball  enthusiasts by translating into English accounts and statistics from early  seasons heretofore found only in Spanish-language books like those of Raul  Diez Muro and Angel Torres, Skinner emphasizes rightly that there are many  shortcomings in PRIDE OF HAVANA as a comprehensive history of Cuba's  national pastime. RGE's heavy anti-Castro's politics causes him to lace the  40s and 50s era &quot;Golden Age&quot; with a thick coat of unwarranted  nostalgia (baseball was actually near its death-knell in Cuba at the time),  to dismiss the exciting and competitive brand of Cuban League baseball  played after the revolution as totally worthless and unworthy of detailed  chronicle, and to ignore the crucial fact (which should be central to any  comprehensive history of island baseball) that the sport has only been  national in its scope in Cuba after 1962 (the professional league which  ended in 1961 was restrict to the city of Havana). Skinner's review also  underscores other shortcomings: facts of Negro League barnstorming in Cuba  are often presented without documentation and sometimes even inaccurtate;  abilities and accomplishments of recent defectors and Cuban-born major  leaguers are highly exaggerated (especially the claim that one-dimensional  slugger Jose Canseco is perhaps the best-ever Cuban born player, rather  than Martin Dihigo or Tony Oliva or Luis Tiant Jr.); legitimate island  stars like Omar Linares, Jose Ibar  and Jose Contreras are taken lightly  because &quot;they have not played against major leaguers,&quot; and the  outright dismissal of the past forty years of Cuban baseball development  (about one-third of the time frame covered by the saga of Cuban baseball)  undermines any claim for a full-scale comprehensive history of the subject.  THE PRIDE OF HAVANA has its many merits. But if one wants to see the true  coloration of RGE's approach and discover what is missing in this rather  incomplete history of Cuban baseball, an excellent start is David Skinner's  perceptive review (NINE, Vol. 8, No. 2, Spring 2000).	2000-04-10

For Miller: &quot;SMOKE is visual, visceral energy. The text is more like  extended cutlines to describe the myriad of photos, sepia, black-and-white,  color, that fill every page, often with all three hues on the same page.  Every angle of Cuban baseball is explored - its origins and pioneers, Cuban  stars who played in the US major leagues, early barnstorming tours that  took the likes of Babe Ruth and Christy Mathewson to Cuba. The dilemmas of  racial identity are seen as light-skinned Adolfo Luque was welcomed to the  North American Majors, while dark-skinned Martin Dihigo, considered by many  the greatest of all Cuban ballplayers, was barred. Statistical records span  nearly 120 years with never-before-available data from Cuban competition  for the years 1962-1998 (even Fidel Castro's short-lived pitching career  receives its due). Rarely does a baseball book offer so much new  information to a new audience (American fans) in such superb fashion.&quot;	2000-04-09

Price's &quot;Pitching  Around Fidel&quot; and Rucker and Bjarkman's &quot;Smoke&quot;. Regarding  &quot;Smoke&quot; Baxter writes the following: <br />&quot;Peter Bjarkman's  lively 'Smoke' takes us back 125 years to the origins of the sport on the  island. Though the book, which was released last fall, tills much of the  same ground plowed months earlier by Roberto Gonzalez Echevarria's  authoritative 'The Pride of Havana,' Bjarkman's writing is far more  accessible - and enjoyable - that Gonzalez's dense, academic  style.<br />&quot;Bjarkman moves quickly through the history, stopping to  examine the first legends of Cuban baseball, the postwar Golden Age of  baseball on the island, and the post-revolution era, in which sport became  a weapon in the Cold War. The text is accompanied by more than 200 rare  photographs collected by famed baseball archivist Mark Rucker, and a  comprehensive collection of statistics from Cuban League play, both before  and after the revolution. By its very scope 'Smoke' is necessarily less  detailed than Jamail's book. But as both an introduction to and a  photographic history of Cuban baseball, it stands unequalled.&quot;	2000-04-07

Richard Miller writes in Sports Collectors Digest that &quot;rarely does a baseball book offer so much new information to a new audience (American fans) in such  superb fashion&quot; (1-21-00). LA Times reviewer Kevin Baxter praises the  book's &quot;warm and vivid picture of Cuba's 125-year-old love affair with  America's pastime&quot; and calls the volume &quot;a fan-friendly Ciff's  Notes version-brightly written and breezy, but still managing to hit all  the high points&quot; (9-23-99). Most significantly, El Nuevo Herald (the  Spanish-language version of the Miami Herald)-often an uncompromising voice  for Cuban-American anti-Castro sentiments-is lavish in its praise of SMOKE  as &quot;perhaps the most groundbreaking book on the history of Cuban  baseball&quot; (11-8-99) and touts the work for avoiding the  &quot;politicization&quot; which weakens other Cuban baseball histories and  also for giving equal voice to the stories of both pre-revolution and  post-revolution baseball on the island.<br />Not surprisingly, however, even  an unpolitical book will (like Elian Gonzalez) become a political  &quot;football&quot; when Cuba is the subject of inquiry. Some of SMOKE's  recent on-line reviewers, voicing a Miami-based Cuban-exile viewpoint which  still finds anathema in any and all positive words about everything found  in post-revolutionary Cuba, have taken to the internet to blast our book as  insulting to the American-Cuban community because it does not find fault  with Castro's purported human rights violations, and also to blast the  book's authors as &quot;knowing nothing about Cuba or its  history.&quot;<br />It is our contention that potential readers of SMOKE would  be well-warned to approach such off-target &quot;reviews&quot; in the  context in which they are written. Yes, there are a small handful of  typographical flaws in this book as in every other, and we are admittedly  not at all shy about lavishly praising contemporary Cuban baseball as the  refreshing and entertaining spectacle we have experienced it to be. Our  book's considerable value and strong reception is best measured, perhaps,  by the fact that SMOKE has been nominated for each and every one of this  year's top literary awards in the field of baseball history: Spitball  magazine's prestigious CASEY AWARD (finalist), The Sporting News-Society  for American Baseball Research Award (finalist), The HAROLD SEYMOUR MEDAL  (finalist), and the Davey Moore Baseball Literature Award (Honorable  Mention). And Miami's Nuevo Herald found the book so meritorious that it  ran an eight-week Spanish-language serialization during the months of  November, December and January.<br />The charge that the book's authors know  nothing about Cuba or the Cuban baseball scene is also quickly belied by  the strong and enthusiastic reception of SMOKE in Cuba itself-among  baseball officials, old-time dedicated baseball fans who are in touch with  both the pre- and post-revolution Cuban League scene, the Cuban sporting  press, and the dedicated &quot;aficionados&quot; in Havana's Parque Central  who are the self-appointed caretakers of the island's grand baseball  tradition. The book has been praised in the pages of GRANMA (the official  government press) even though it has taken the bold step (not favored in  many Cuban government circles) of carrying photos and relating accounts of  the careers of players like &quot;El Duque&quot; Hernandez and Livan  Hernandez who have subsequently fled the island for major league  careers.<br />Contrary to nostalgia-based popular opinion found in some  quarters of the Miami Cuban-exile community, baseball did NOT reach a final  &quot;golden age&quot; in Cuba during the decades of the forties and  fifties. In truth the sport was dying on the island in those mid-century  decades (as it also was in the US, in the face of decade-long New York  Yankees domination and the early advent oftelevised games). Havana's  ballparks were half-empty for Cuban winter league games throughout the '50s  and the AAA Sugar Kings ('54-'60) unsuccessfully begged for fans. More  importantly, there was no Cuban national baseball whatsoever before the  revolution; professional baseball on the island during the century's first  six decades was strictly a limited Havana affair. And the amateur leagues  of that era were unexceptionally reserved for white players only.<br />For all  its other possible disastrous consequences, the revolution of 1959 launched  a truly national baseball league on the island, revived waning fan  enthusiasm, and opened some of Cuban baseball's most glorious chapters.  Those chapters, as well as the ones that preceded, are more vividly  recounted in both photos and text in SMOKE than in any other Cuban baseball  history. We have also salvaged a photographic record of Cuban baseball that  is slowly but surely being ravaged and destroyed by the passage of time and  the existing economic conditions on the island. Open the pages of this book  and step into any epoch of Cuban baseball you might chose. Be enthralled by  the full-color imagery that is almost as lively as the island's national  pastime itself. This is one book, we believe, that truly can be judged by  its cover.	2000-02-06

Also, while the author is condemnatory in his preface of others who have  treated Latin baseball with a disregard for the Spanish language, he  himself often mangles Spanish and English names (Gourriel/Gurriel,  Ulrick/Ulrich/Ullrich, Willie/Willy Miranda, Aldolfo/Adolfo Luque, Ron/Don  Blasingame, Buck O'Neill/O'Neil, Double Duty Radcliffe/Radcliff,  Zavala/Zabala, Ramon/Roger Colorao/Colorado, Bustamente/Bustamante,  Almendares/Almandares, Wilbur/Wilmur Fields, Franklyn/Franklin Murray,  etc.) as well as historical facts (Marrero was 25 (35) in 1946, Prieto  returned to Oakland in 1977 (1997), Pumpsie Green was an outfielder  (infielder), the second Pan Am games were played in 1930, etc.). This is a  solid book and in some places even a wonderful book. But poor editing  leaves it short of a scholarly book; and the excessive emphasis on Cuban  baseball during the author's own childhood (1940s and 1950s) also leaves  the volume considerably short of being a definitive historical treatment of  Cuban baseball.	1999-12-30

But there is little here about the mysterious role of baseball on the island after Castro's rise to power. This book is  more of a personal memoir of Echevarria's own childhood baseball memories  than a true history which explores the full Cuban baseball story.	1999-11-15

Engaging portraits of hundreds of the sport's historical figures are supplemented by concise histories of both college  and pro ball and a most useful historical timeline. And the Epilogue  arguing for a reassessment of the &quot;greatest player of all time&quot;  is a must read.	1999-11-15

A Socio-Erotic Journey	Books	3	8	11	N	N	Castro biography raises doubts	Codrescu may have a feel for some aspects of the Cuban scene, but he hasn't done his homework very well when it comes to Fidel. The author unfortunately repeats the old and inaccurate tale that Fidel was a major  league pitching prospect (Fidel pitched in high school, but never at the  University of Havana and was never offered a professional contract) and in  this version even suggests a 1956 big-league tryout. Did Fidel hurl for  scouts while in the Sierra Maestre? Did Che also show his stuff to big  league scouts? The repeating of such a groundless fairy tale about Fidel  raises serious questions about the historical accuracy of the remainder of  the author's Cuban accounts. Peter C. Bjarkman, Author of &quot;Smoke: The  Romance and Lore of Cuban Baseball&quot; (1999).	1999-10-13

The book is poorly edited and filled with literally hundreds of typographical errors.  (Also the footnotes section at the end of the hardcover edition is simply  eliminated from the end of the paperback, without corresponding adjustments  in the text!) This factor is especially disappointing when it comes to the  butchered names of dozens of Latin ballplayers. There are also numerous  historical inaccuracies here. Hispaniola is not an island to the west of  Cuba. Jackie Robinson was not called up to the Brooklyn Dodgers &quot;not  long after the 1947 began.&quot; Aluminum bats are not made in Cuba by the  Batos company. And such errors go on and on. This book is a major  disappointment when it comes to historical historical research.	1999-09-22
