Hick shows that all attempts to explain this doctrine either implicitly deny that Jesus was a human being like other human beings or redefine God in such a way that God is no longer God.<br /><br />Some of the theological argumentation is a bit technical, but with careful reading it is quite intelligible even to the non-professional.  I found the critique of the atonement (the idea that Jesus' death on the cross was necessary for the forgiveness of human sin) to be particularly cogent insofar as Hick quotes from the sayings of Jesus himself to show that a sacrificial death is not necessary to effect divine forgiveness.  (In this context, Hick quotes both the Lord's Prayer and the story of the Prodigal Son.)<br /><br />Traditional Christians might think that Christianity is utterly destroyed if shorn of the doctrines of the Trinity and the Atonement, but Hick disagrees.  He proposes an understanding of Jesus' life as a metaphor for the action of God in the world, a metaphor all the more potent because it is grounded in the real-life example of Jesus.  Hick also believes that the Eastern Orthodox concept of human \\"deification,\\" the transformation of the human personality through the mysterious workings of the Holy Spirit or Divine Energies, provides a potentially fruitful basis for a future Christian theology.<br /><br />Although Hick is critical of orthodox theology and of the crimes of Christian civilization, he is not polemical in a rude or crude sort of way, nor does he ignore - as many critics of Christianity do - the deficiencies of other religions and the cultures they produced.  (However, one might disagree with his claim that all religions have had pretty much the same effect on culture, and that the advantages and disadvantages of the various religions ultimately cancel each other out.  In my view, that is a highly debatable proposition.  I think different religions effect culture in very different ways, and develop in different ways because of ideas present at the core of each individual religion.)<br /><br />One might have wished that Hick spent some time discussing the doctrine of the Incarnation as it is found in Hinduism, which believes in successive divine incarnations throughout history.  Perhaps some insight into the Christian doctrine of Incarnation could have been found there, just as an analysis of the Buddhist understanding of \\"taking refuge\\" in the Buddha might shed some light on the Christian doctrine of the Atonement.  As it is, however, Hick does not delve into the theological or philosophical nuances of any religion other than Christianity.<br /><br />Traditional Christians will likely be offended or alarmed by this book, but Hick's sincere challenge to Christian orthodoxy is what the times demand.  In a world where Islam has once again become (or remains) militant and agressive, Christianity must regroup on a firmer moral and intellectual foundation if it is to survive the clash of civilizations that has already begun.ious workings of the Holy Spirit or Divine Energies, provides a potentially fruitful basis for a future Christian theology.   <br /> <br />Although Hick is critical of orthodox theology and of the crimes of Christian civilization, he is not polemical in a rude or crude sort of way, nor does he ignore - as many critics of Christianity do - the deficiencies of other religions and the cultures they produced.

Despite its relatively liberal beliefs, the Bektashi Order is little known in the West because it is largely confined to Turkey and the Balkans (its only significant American presence is in the Detroit area).<br /><br />Although often linked with the heterodox and controversial Alevi movement in Turkey, the Bektashis downplay such associations and generally affirm their ties with Islam, even as some of their practices depart from Islamic norms (alcohol plays a minor role in some of their practices, and women have perhaps more influence than in the other Islamic Sufi orders).  The Bektashis have played a significant political and military role in the Middle East, largely through their links to the Jannissaries.  This book explores that history in some detail.<br /><br />Although this book provides a good look at the origin and basic beliefs of the Bektashis, it is now becoming somewhat dated.  The distinct-but-related Alevi and Bektashi movements have became a major social and political force in modern Turkey and the Balkans, and English language accounts of these developments are almost non-existent.  This is a shame, for any liberalizing trends in the Islamic world can only be for the good, and such movements deserve wider publicity.  For now, John Kinsley Birge's interesting but dated presentation will have to do.	2005-09-26

Although grounded in the Bible, Christian theology has always sought to express itself in the intellectual language of its day.  Fundamentalists may oppose this tendency, but others regard it as essential to express Christian truth in a manner that is intelligible to people in changing times and places.  Indeed, this process of interperetation is found even in the Bible itself, as when Paul takes the Christian message to the Greeks.<br /><br />The late Fr. Bede Griffiths was a British Roman Catholic monk who lived for many years in a small \\"ashram\\" (hermitage/monastery) in India, and who was deeply influenced by the religion of India as expressed in the foundational writings of the Vedas, the Upanishads, and the Bhagasvad Gita, as well as the Vedantist writings that gave philosophical expression to those religious ideas.  Far from being a New Age dabbler, Fr. Griffiths internalized these teachings and lived them on a daily basis, adopting the garb and lifestyle of an Indian \\"sanyassin\\" even as he remained true to his Catholicism.<br /><br />Well, MOSTLY true, for there are some areas in which Fr. Griffiths orthodoxy will seem a bit shaky to traditionalists, as when he seems to deny the traditional Catholic understanding of the Incarnation of Jesus. (Despite this, Fr. Griffiths was never - to my knowledge - publicly criticized or censured by the Catholic hierarchy.  Perhaps this is because Griffiths was a saintly man, not an agitator or egomaniacal rabble-rouser.)<br /><br />Griffiths thus applies his understanding  of Indian thought to traditional Catholic teachings, finding both commonalities and points of divergence.  Unlike many New Age thinkers, he does not say that all religions are the same or make glib generalizations of equality where real differences exist.<br /><br />Griffiths also takes note of various trends in modern science and physics to see what bearing they have on religion and the philosophy of religion.  His thinking here is perhaps less original, relying largely upon observations from others who are more trained in the hard sciences.<br /><br />I believe that Fr. Griffiths is on to something, that the marriage of Christianity and Vedanta presents exciting and fruitful possibilities for a revival of Christian theology, philosophy, and monasticism.  This is not crass syncretism, but thoughtful, organic development.  I hope that Fr.

In recent years there has been an enormous explosion of interest in Gnostic Christian texts such as \\"The Gospel of Thomas\\" and \\"The Gospel of Mary Magdalene\\".  Almost overlooked in this fascination with early, non-canonical (i.e., omitted from the Bible) Christian texts has been The Didache (\\"The Teaching\\"), a \\"training manual\\" for Gentile converts to an early Jewish-Christian community.  (Most scholars date \\"The Didache\\" to about 90-120 A.D., but Milovec opts for an earlier date between 50-80 A.D.) <br /> <br />\\"The Didache\\" is a manual of initiation, not theology, but Milovec attempts to read between the lines to discern glimpses of the underlying theology.  Although Milovec's speculations sometime stray a bit too far from the available evidence, I think he is basically correct in seeing \\"The Didache\\" as reflecting a Jewish-Christian community who viewed Jesus primarily in prophetic and messianic terms, and not as the literal God incarnate of later Christian theology.  Of particular interest in this context are the eucharistic prayers found in \\"The Didache,\\" prayers which do not reflect the \\"this is my body  . . . this is my blood\\" phraseology of the New Testament sources.  Also, \\"The Didache\\" provides perhaps the earliest specific Christian condemnation of abortion, and reiterates the Pauline critique of homosexuality (or, at least, one form of it, characterized as \\"the corruption of boys\\").  Thus \\"The Didache\\" perhaps has relevance to today's \\"What would Jesus say?\\" debates.  <br /> <br />What gives \\"The Didache\\" credibility to me is its absence of Gnostic influence and its general similarity in language to the gospels, \\"The Acts of the Apostles,\\" and the \\"Letter of James\\".  In fact, it's emphasis on morality and its absence of high Christology (Jesus as God, Jesus as atoning for the sins of the world), seems to place it in the Jamesian tradition stemming from the Jewish Christian community centered in Jerusalem.  <br /> <br />In my opinion (and that of most scholars), the Gnostic gospels are relatively late 2nd century creations that tell us little about Jesus or his earliest group of followers.  \\"The Didache\\" provides a better window into that world, and I recommend it highly.  Milovec loses one star for a little bit of over-speculation and for a writing style that is not particularly captivating.  Still, he gets four stars for a basically solid book (supported with the original Greek text and ample-but-not-exhausting discussion of translation issues) that casts needed light on an early Christian text that has been too often neglected.	2005-08-31
US	51790226	RI9YBR0V5GB26	0567088308	274047952	Unexpected Way: On Converting from Buddhism to Catholicism	Books	2	38	69	N	N	A Dry and Pedantic Conversion Story	Stories of conversion have a long history in the Christian tradition, and some of these accounts are among my all-time favorites, e.g., St. Augustine's \\"Confessions,\\"  Thomas Merton's \\"The Seven Storey Mountain,\\" and Fr.  Seraphim Rose's \\"Not of this World.\\"  In my opinion, Paul Williams' \\"The Unexpected Way\\" falls well short of those classic spiritual autobiographies.<br /><br />Although there are occasional biographical and anecdotal asides from Williams' daily life, most of the book consists of Williams' philosophical arguments in defense of Catholic Christianity and against the Mayahana Buddhism which he practised for most of his adult life.  Thus we find a rehash of the traditional arguments for the existence of God, arguments for the survival of the human personality after death, arguments against reincarnation, arguments for the resurrection of Jesus, and so forth.  Insofar as Williams is a philosopher by profession, this didactic style is perhaps to be expected, but since I myself was a philosophy major in college, much of this has a \\"been there, done that\\" quality for me.  Quite frankly, I often found my mind wandering when reading this book.  Perhaps it will have greater immediacy for those who aren't accustomed to philosophical debate, and for whom disputation of these ideas represents a new experience.<br /><br />Williams is far less succesful in making Christianity seem  alive and vibrant than Merton, Chesterton, or C.S. Lewis did in their day, and I would refer readers to those authors for conversion stories and/or Christian apologetics that are far more engaging.<br /><br />Moreover, in defending traditional Catholic doctrines, Williams often falls back upon appeals to ecclesiastical authority rather than engaging in a real critique to see how well those doctrines are grounded in scripture and whether new understandings are possible.  The efforts of men like Thomas Merton and Bede Griffiths to revisit old teachings in the light of new knowledge seem antithetical to Williams' approach.  As a new convert, he does not want to rock the boat.	2005-08-25

By \\"myth\\" Sampson means a story line in which a basic core of historical facts is altered - by addition, distortion, or subtraction - to create a picture in which Christianity is seen as a monolithic and destructive entity fundamentally hostile to humanistic values.   <br /> <br />As timely as today's headlines, these modern \\"myths\\" include:  (1) the story of Galileo versus the Catholic Church;  (2)  the ongoing Christian fight against Darwinism; (3)  the pernicious influence of Christian missionaries on native societies; (4) Christian denigration of the body and sexuality;  (5) Christian disregard for the environment;  and (5) Christian persecution of witches.  Sampson shows how in each case a generally accepted story has been created which seriously misrepresents the historical facts. <br /> <br />For example, in the chapter on Darwin, Sampson shows how the accepted story line of \\"Darwin and reason versus the church and superstition\\" overlooks the widespread scientific opposition to Darwin's ideas, both then and now, and the relative lack of empirical support for Darwinism.  Moreover, Christians were not uniformly hostile to Darwin, nor were their objections necessarily based on Biblical fundamentalism.   <br /> <br />Sampson also offers some interesting background on the famous Scopes \\"Monkey Trial,\\" providing a much needed corrective for how that trial is often presented in the popular press.  Even more to the point, Sampson shows how social policies derived from Darwinist assumptions - imperialism, eugenics, unfettered capitalism - were often OPPOSED by Christians. <br /> <br />And that is perhaps Sampson's major point:  many of the attitudes for which Christianity is blamed are actually products of Enlightenment rationalism or Greek philosophy.  Thus, the Indians were conquered not so muchbecause Christianity demanded it but because modern, progressive, enlightened civilization demanded it; and if the environment is degraded, it is because since the Enlightenment we no longer see this as God's world, but man's, to do with as we please. <br /> <br />Sampson does not hide Christianity's historical sins.  Rather, he puts them in perspective and shows how they often intertwined with other factors that are now overlooked.  As a defense of a nuanced view of both actual history and intellectual history, Sampson provides an excellent antidote to the simplistic and bigoted myths which so often pass for fact.	2005-08-01

In fact, I wish she weren't a feminist and a lesbian, because those issues might detract from her central point, i.e.,  that Islam is seriously in need of reform and self-examination.  Manji sees that much of what passes for the will of God in Islam is nothing more than male pride and Arab chavinism.  She calls a spade a spade. <br /> <br />But self-examination is precisely what orthodox Islamic fundamentalism forbids.  It is forbidden to suggest that the behavior of Mohammed was deeply flawed or  that the Koran might be anything less than the perfectly recorded word of God.   <br /> <br />Manji knows that the violence of Islam is no accident, that it stems directly from the Koran and the Hadith (traditions of the Prophet).  (In this, she agrees with Bin Laden and disagrees with President Bush.)  She knows that political correctness only feeds the beast, makes it more arrogant and more confident, and that what is needed is some real self-examination in the Islamic world.  According to Manji, what the Islamic world needs is courage, truth, and self-criticism, an ability to sift the tradition for what is good and what is not.  <br /> <br />Manji has strong words for the mullahs and imams who preach hate and violence.  From where do they derive their authority?  Is not Islam intended to be a religion without a priesthood and without a clergy?  Manji sees the imams for what they are:  frightened little men protecting their own turf and blasphemously glorifying their own base passions as the will of God.  <br /> <br />This is not a great book in terms of style or intellectual depth;  it is contemporary and informal, written at the level of People magazine.  But it is a courageous book with an important message.  Indeed, Manji shows more real courage than a hundred self-proclaimed \\"holy warriors,\\" whose acts of violence reveal both theirimpotence and their ignorance.   <br /> <br />	2005-08-01

I read this 300-page book in one day, which says something about Peter Tremayne's ability to keep the story moving with plenty of twists and turns.  Tremayne artfully evokes the landscape and social setting of 7th century Ireland, and is adept at creating visual imagery to take us back to that world. <br /> <br />His heroine, Sister Fidelma, is the proud forerunner of today's special prosecutor, assigned to investigate evil deeds throughout the Emerald Isle.  In this case, she ponders the grisly beheadings of two women at a monastery on the Southwest Coast, a mystery which soon becomes entwined with political intrigue and a threat to the kingdom.   <br /> <br />Sister Fidelma is very much a modern woman in an ancient setting, and this will be appealing or offputting according to the reader's predilections.  If the book has a fault, it is in Tremayne's gratuitously injecting his views on various theological controversies into a murder mystery. In the same context, others may question the historical accuracy of some of his claims.   <br /> <br />These caveats nothwithstanding, the book is a page-turner that will not go half-read.  Stodgy conservatives such as myself might be irked by this or that historical point, but we will nonetheless have had ourselves a good read.    <br /> <br />	2005-06-27

He describes the history of these terms in Jewish thought, and traces how these terms evolved during the formative years of Christianity.  <br /> <br />Dunn generally leans towards the idea that the earliest Christian tradition viewed Jesus as a human being specially chosen by God for a unique role in the salvation of the Jewish people and - secondarily - of all people.  Yet, somewhat inconsistently, at the end he claims that the late development of \\"high Christology\\" - of Jesus viewed as the divine second person of the Holy Trinity - is an acceptable and logical development of the earlier view of Jesus as a divinely chosen human being.   <br /> <br />That is my only quibble with a book that otherwise exhibits sound scholarship and reasoned argument.  Perhaps most of us moderns - Dunn included  - are infected with the Hegelian idea that whatever happens in the world - if it involves major historical trends and Ideas - somehow enjoys Divine blessing, even if it seemingly contradicts our understandings of the Divine Will.  But I digress . . . as a thorough exploration of the progression and development of the Christian understanding of the nature and role of Jesus, this book is a \\"must have.\\"	2005-05-31

Whereas Thurman sees the journey as a spiritual quest, Wise tends to look upon it more as an adventure.   <br /> <br />As the book progressed, I became intrigued how an educated  Westerner like Thurman could so thoroughly immerse himself in an alien worldview such as that of Tibetan Buddhism.  Here is a man who has no doubt dissected (and rejected) Christianity from a standpoint of strict rationalism, but who then does an about face and accepts an alien religion thoroughly steeped in a complex psycho-spiritual mythology.  Thus we find the crusty old Thurman performing in all seriousnes acts which would strike some as rank superstition, e.g., performing a complex fire ritual to an assortment of Buddhist and Vedic deities, circumambulating the \\"Great Freedom Pole,\\" and prostrating on the shores of the \\"holy\\" Lake Manasarovar. <br /> <br />This I found this book interesting both for the \\"right\\" reasons - as an introduction to Tibetan Buddhist beliefs and practices - and for the \\"wrong\\" reasons, i.e., my musings about the psychological quirks which draw some educated Westerners to Buddhism.  Perhaps, as Rudyard Kiping once wrote, it's simply a yearning for a spirituality shorn of the negative associations of childhood, guilt, and repression:  \\"Ship me somewhere east of Suez, where the best is like the worst, where there ain't no Ten Commandments, an' a man can raise a thirst.\\"  <br /> <br />	2005-05-29

Buzzard and Hunting argue that, despite its centrality in Christian theology, the doctrine of the Trinity is supported by \\"proof texts\\" that are almost always ambiguous and subject to alternate interpretations that are more cogent than the traditional Trinitarian interpretation.<br /><br />It is important to recognize that the authors are not skeptics, modernists, atheists, or New Agers.  They remain Christians - and fairly conservative ones at that - who believe that Jesus is best understood as the Jewish Messiah, a human being chosen by God to teach the world the true nature and will of God and to live out the will of God in human form.  The authors are not motivated by a desire to \\"modernize\\" theology, but to return it to its authentic original understanding, consistent with Jewish monotheism.<br /><br />The book is thus a valuable addition to the Christological debate, but it is not without its flaws.  It could have been better organized - the same arguments are repeated in different chapters - and the full implications of the rejection of the divinity of Jesus are not drawn out, e.g., how does this affect the doctrine of the atonement, which is (seemingly) a central theme of the New Testament? Be that as it may, the book raises serious questions about a central claim of Christian orthodoxy, a claim which is supremely relevant given the challenge of Islam.	2005-05-29

But if the specific social context has changed, the fragmentation of American society continues unabated, as does the crisis of the human spirit that this book describes and addresses.  So, for me, the book remains supremely relevant, supremely perceptive, brilliantly written, and hilariously funny.<br /><br />Set in the Deep South of an America in a virtual state of civil war and anarchy, \\"Love In The Ruins\\" follows the exploits of its flawed hero, Dr. Tom More, a boozing psychiatrist and lapsed Catholic.  More has invented the lapsometer - a \\"stethoscope of the soul\\" - that enables people to both diagnose and treat their inner demons.  But in the wrong hands, the lapsometer can wreak havoc, and much of the book traces More's efforts to keep the lapsomoter out of the hands of a government determined to use the lapsometer for its own nefarious purposes.<br /><br />Percy brilliantly describes and satirizes the competing elements in this American Apocalypse - the country club conservatives, the \\"groovy\\" priests, the religious Right and Left, the technocrats, the sexologists, the racists, the Black revolutionaries, the drop-outs, and the sinister but bungling government bureaucrats who have their own vision of a \\"Brave New World.\\"<br /><br />From its masterful opening pages (which, contrary to another reviewer, I think are just about the best writing I've seen in modern American literature) this book will outrage partisans of the Left and Right while giving hope to those who try to occupy the \\"radical center\\" where the human spirit is defended against the predations of all the \\"isms\\" of the modern world.	2005-05-25

The so-called \\"gay rights\\" movement arguably represents the biggest threat to freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of association in modern American history.  Authors Alan Sears and Craig Osten provide ample, specific evidence that the so-called movement for \\"tolerance\\" is in fact highly intolerant, and wishes to marginalize, criminalize, and punish any person or institution who does not accept the gay agenda in all its specifics.   <br /> <br />Gays in America are well above the national average in income, economic clout, and access to the media, and the story of the gay-rights movement has largely been presented to the public through pro-gay filters and through explicitly pro-gay propaganda.  In this book, however, the seething hatred of the gay lobby for traditional Christianity is laid bare, and the end-game of \\"gay liberation\\" is exposed.  Gay activists want to destroy anyone who rejects their agenda, and you can read it here in their own words. <br /> <br />\\"Gay rights\\" legislation replaces sporadic (and relatively uncommon) private discrimination against homosexuals with state-sponsored discrimination against those who reject the gay agenda, generally conservative Christians.   <br /> <br />The Boy Scouts are the most visible example of an organization that has been hounded, harrassed and punished by gay activists, but there are many others.  Their story is told here: small businessmen; employees of major corporations who resist pro-gay indoctrination; teachers who resist pro-gay curricula - people, in other words,  who have lost their jobs, lost business contracts, and been forced to act against deeply held beliefs in order to appease the gay militants.  It is a chilling story of coercion.	2005-05-09

The puzzlement disappears as Horowitz traces the modern history of Leftist thought, showing how the Left has for decades opposed America and sided with America's enemies, regardless of whether those enemies were communists, Nazis, or Islamic radicals.  With ample documentation, Horowitz shows that for the Left, America is always wrong, and it makes little difference whether the president is FDR, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, or George W. Bush.  This point needs to be emphasized, i.e., although the Left may try to exploit popular negative impressions of George W. Bush, Bush himself is ultimately irrelevant to the leftist critique of America.  For the Left, America is irredeemably evil, and nothing less than its total destruction will suffice. <br /> <br />Thus it is no surprise when Horowitz shows that the anti-Iraq war movement was teeming with left-wing radicals, and that these radicals were indeed its core organizers.  (Horowitz makes it clear, however,  that this is NOT to say that anyone who opposed the war was a left-wing radical.)  Horowitz also shows that the Left's opposition was not merely to the Iraq war, but also to the Afghanistan war, and even to any retaliation whatsoever for the 9/11 terrorist strikes.  For the Left, one - and only one - response would have been correct:  to say that the terrorist acts were a justified response to American imperialism and foreign policy, and to admit that everything was America's fault.   <br /> <br />Horowitz also reminds us of some recent history that many have already forgotten, i.e., that the Clinton administration made essentially the same claims regarding Iraq's ongoing and gathering threat that Bush did, even to the point of passing a 1998 congressional resolution calling for regime change in Iraq.  The dishonest duplicity and waffling of Democratic congressmen on the subject of Iraq makes for an interesting sub-plot.   <br /> <br />But the big question is:  Why do secular, left-wing ideologues side with Islamic fundamentalists against the democracies of the West, and particularly the United States?  The answer, Horowitz says, is that the Left's hatred of bourgeois democracy overshadows everything else, even its commitment to form a coherent idea of the future or to come to grips with the full implications of its own self-destructive actions.  <br /> <br />Horowitz thus exposes the dirty little secret of today's \\"liberalism\\":  it is not your father's liberalism, committed to democracy, freedom, and civil liberties, but an authoritarian - even totalitarian - rejection of the American experiment, committed to America's destruction as a necessary prelude to a future whose contours it refuses to examine, perhaps because those contours are too horrible to examine and too far removed from the ideals the Left claims to uphold.     <br /> <br />  <br />	2005-05-04

This is not a \\"how to\\" book, and the treatment of these topics is largely anecdotal.  <br /> <br />Those already familiar with Sufism will find little that is new here, other than the details of Howe's personal quest.  But this quest is described in rather sketchy form and lacks the romanticism and drama of the accounts written by Reshad Feild and O. M. Burk.  Howe's approach is unapologetically \\"gushy,\\" and readers of a more reserved, intellectual bent will possibly find themselves slightly put-off by her enthusiasms.  Paradoxically, despite her gushiness, I found her writing style to be rather flat and boring.   <br /> <br />Readers new to Sufism should be aware that Howe's brand of Sufism is an atypical, highly-Westernized and syncretistic form of Sufism with an almost New Age quality.  (Howe briefly describes a visit to an unnamed traditional Islamic Sufi order;  put-off by its \\"sexist\\" attitudes, she never went back.)  Most Sufi orders remain much more committed to the religious and ethical framework of Islam, and it would be difficult to penetrate very far into most forms of Sufism without a strong affinity for the prophet Mohammed.  In the Sufism of Mary Blye Howe, Mohammed almost disappears.    <br /> <br />Readers sympathetic to the syncretistic and \\"universalist\\" Sufism of the \\"Sufi Order of the West\\" (or one of its offshoots) will perhaps find what they are looking for in these pages.  Those interested in a Sufism closer to its Islamic roots will have to look elsewhere.	2005-05-03

All right, I admit it - I never finished this book, even after three tries.  Why?  Because the author's renderings of the New Testament Greek into the original Aramaic were so embarrassingly contrived to dovetail with modern New Age and feminist concepts that I just couldn't take it any more. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong - I am all for the effort to get behind the Greek to the (presumably) original Aramaic to see if new light can be shed on difficult, ambiguous, or controversial passages of the New Testament.  But Douglas-Klotz takes such liberties with his translations that we are moved farther away from - not closer to - the world of Jesus.  He tries too hard to make the text come alive, and we are left with fluff (e.g., addressing God as \\"Father/Mother\\") that has no credibility when attributed to first-century Jews.  Compared to Douglas-Klotz's overblown and pretentious \\"renderings,\\" the straightforwardness of the original Greek comes as a profound relief.   <br /> <br />Scholarship is one thing, but pandering to people's biases is quite another.  Douglas-Klotz is guilty of the latter, and the reader will have to look elsewhere for a credible effort to unveil the Aramaic underpinnings of the New Testament.	2005-04-26

Unlike Daley's other classic \\"The Cruel Sport\\" (recently reissued), which was primarily a photo essay supplemented by text, this book is entirely text.  Daley's format is to write a chapter on each of the Grand Prix circuits of that era (Nurburgring, Monza, Silverstone, Zandvoort, Spa, Monaco, etc.), discussing each circuit's qualities, history, great races, controversies, and accidents. <br /> <br />Daley approaches each circuit anecdotally, often by focusing on the the triumphs and tragedies of a particular driver, e.g., the Marquis de Portago, Phil Hill, Stirling Moss, and Jean Behra, among others.  Daley does NOT focus on the technical aspects of racing, or on the cars themselves, but on the drivers.  He brings an almost mystical attitude to the sport, which will be as appealing to romantics as it will be off-putting to nuts-and-bolts types.   <br /> <br />Daley situates the circuits in their historical and geographical context, always aware of the beauty and danger surrounding the sport, and how the sport has at times intersected with politics and the world beyond racing.  For a romantic look at a Grand Prix world now passed into memory, you can't do better than this. <br /> <br />	2005-04-25

Patrick Hartin proceeds methodically  from a discussion of basic scholarly methodology, on to the question of James' relation to Jesus (brother? step-brother? cousin?), and finally to the question of James' role in the early church and the implications for today.   <br /> <br />Although his scholarship is generally sound, Hartin fails to ask the crucial question about James and the early Jewish Christians:  what are the implications for Christian theology of the existence of a Jewish Christian community which remained true to its Jewish roots for many decades after the death of Jesus?  Since Christians generally have adopted \\"replacement\\" theology, i.e., the idea that the Christian church supplanted the Jewish religion and the Jewish people as God's chosen vehicle for the salvation of mankind, the existence of Christians who remained Jews raises fundamental questions.  If early Jewish Christians rejected replacement theology, what are the implications for Christian doctrine as a whole, particularly in the area of Christology (the nature and role of Jesus?  <br /> <br />The best Hartin can do is draw a false contrast between the \\"theological\\" emphasis of Paul and the \\"ethical\\" emphasis of James.  But Paul would be surprised to learn that he was unconcerned with ethics, and James would be perhaps even more surprised to see his legacy invoked to support modern notions of \\"diversity\\" and moral relativism.  Hartin correctly points out James' concern for the poor, but neglects his warnings about \\"the tug and lure of  . . . passion,\\" the waywardness of the tongue, and the evils of anger and \\"all that is filthy.\\" <br /> <br />Hartin is - I think - too eager to pander to modern, liberal sensibilities.  Hence his annoying (to me) prefacing of each chapter with quotations from \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" quotations whose relevance to the text is often strained, at best.  And when Hartin suggests that James would oppose \\"discriminating against anyone for whatever reason,\\" he has gone too far. That is a modern notion incompatible with the strict morality of the Torah, a morality which James never abandoned. <br />	2005-04-25

Father Amorth brings years of personal experience as an exorcist of the Catholic Church to his treatment of this controversial topic.  Readers whose initial exposure to exorcism has been through lurid films like \\"The Exorcist\\" or the highly dramatic writings of Fr. Malachi Martin will be surprised to learn that exorcism is often a protracted process of spiritual therapy extending over months or even years.  They will also learn that the results of exorcism are mixed, with many failures and partial successes mixed in with the clear victories and complete healings.  As with alcoholism or drug abuse, victory is not achieved merely by surviving a one-time crisis, but through a permanent change of lifestyle and attitude. <br /> <br />Readers may also be surprised to learn that many elements in the Catholic hierarchy - a clear majority in fact - look upon exorcism with suspicion and even contempt, preferring to view personality disorders through the comforting (to them) lens of modern psychology.  Amorth is himself very aware of the need for discernment to properly evaluate the true cause behind oppressive psychological phenomena, but is nonetheless frustrated by the church's often dismissive attitude towards exorcism and the resulting burden this places on the few authorized exorcists. <br /> <br />Insofar as this is a look at the real world of exorcism as practiced by today's Catholic Church, those who are unsympathetic to Catholicism will perhaps find themselves arguing both with Amorth's diagnosis of these complex problems and with his solutions.  But for those of a traditional Catholic or Christian viewpoint, Amorth will be simultaneously persuasive, comforting, and disturbing. <br />	2005-04-25

This still very much a book about the years 1959-1962.  Here is what is new:  bios of Jimmy Clark and Jackie Stewart;  new Forward and Afterword written by Daley, explaining how he got into motor racing journalism, and why he got out;  color photos of Bandini on inside of front and back covers;  a few new photos (about half a dozen), replacing a few that were dropped;  and a glossy page format which gives much better definition to the black-and-white photos.  And that's it.  There's nothing here of Rindt or Amon or Courage or Pedro Rodriguez or Siffert or Hulme.  If you already have the original book, it's (possibly) a matter of your personal budget whether you'll spring for the new version;  I did, and I don't regret it.  I enjoyed the new Forward and Afterword because they told me something about Daley himself.  I was very surprised to learn that at the time of the original publication of \\"The Cruel Sport,\\" he was in his early 30s;  I had always assumed he was a much older man.  And his story of his struggle to establish himself as a writer was fascinating.   <br /> <br />(2)  If you are a tekkie, this book is not for you.  But if you are a romantic - even perhaps a bit of a mystic - about motor racing in the glory days of the early 60s, this book will become a fast favorite.  It is basically a photo book supported by text, text which is sparse and almost poetic at times - expressionistic and anecdotal.  Daley covers Grand Prix racing thematically:  there are sections on the drivers, the factories, practice, accidents, and so forth.  There are brief bios of most of the drivers of that era, the longest of which - about 5 pages - is about Stirling Moss.  Other drivers who feature prominently are Phil Hill,Count Wolfgang von Trips, and Graham Hill.  The photos are wonderful, and are all in black-and-white (except for the inside cover pics, both of Bandini - one of him talking to reporters, the other of his fatal crash at Monaco).  Daley is above all preoccupied with the danger of the sport and the qualities of the men who pursue it.  The early 60s was an era of great names, great faces, and - all too often - tragedy.  This book captures the spirit of the times, and stands alongside the annual F1 reviews of Louis Stanley as the most fascinating glimpses into the pre-commercialized world of Grand Prix racing, an era rapidly receding into the mists of time.	2005-04-22

This book tells the true story of the men and women who gave birth to those legends in the first half of the 20th century, and describes the events that transformed their visionary dreams and aspirations into a full-blown Myth of Avalon, celebrated to this day with pageants, plays, and festivals.

Originally published more than 40 years ago, this was the first UFO book I ever read, and it is perhaps still my favorite.  The late Edward Ruppelt was for several years the chief of Project Blue Book, the Air Force's official task force for the investigation of UFO reports.  In that capacity, Ruppelt was privy to the inner workings of the Air Force and to the realities behind official public pronouncements.  Perhaps to the disappointment of some, Ruppelt provides no revelations of government coverups or fantastic secrets.  Rather, he reveals an Air Force whose attitude to UFOs was most often one of ridicule and annoyance.   <br /> <br />Ruppelt himself rises above official diffidence, and steers a middle course between skepticism and credulity as he describes the classic UFO sightings and UFO flaps of the 1950s, including the Lubbock Lights, the Mantell incident, the Washington, D.C. flap, and many others.  One gains the impression that Ruppelt is a cautious believer in the phenomenon, if not an enthusiast or apostle. <br /> <br />The 1950s were an era when UFOs were still primarily lights in the sky, not bearers of insectoid abductors or intergalactic geneticists.  But despite the absence of the up-close-and-personal horrors of modern UFO reports, Ruppelt's accounts will occasionally send a chill up your spine.  I attribute this to the book's excellent writing, which exactly captures the mood and sentiments of the 1950s. <br /> <br />And, ultimately, that is what \\"The Report on Unidentified Objects\\" is:  a period piece, a wonderful journey back to the innocence and freshness of the 1950s, when silvery disks flashed through the sky and inspired fear, awe, and wonder in a public waking up to the realities of the atomic age.	2005-04-14

Carretto is a worthy successor to the example of Foucauld, living a life of prayer and poverty and silent witness in a precarious Islamic environment.<br /><br />Carretto speaks movingly and without apology in the language of his inherited Catholicism, yet always succeeds - without affectation or pandering - in making ancient teachings seem new, alive, and relevant.  His theology is solidly based in the Bible and in Catholic tradition, yet he speaks with a personal  authority grounded in sacrifice and a lifetime committment to God, the Church, and his fellow man.<br /><br />Above all, in a Church increasingly riven by struggles between right and left, liberal and conservative, Carretto combines in himself the best aspects of both, i.e., an inward piety grounded in prayer, meditation, and the sacraments, coupled with a social awareness open to the problems and concerns of the world, especially the world of the poor and disaffected.<br /><br />This book is both timeless and contemporary, the hallmark of a book written from the heart and to the heart.	2005-04-14

I say \\"among the best,\\" because Ehrman's book is not as comprehensive as some of the other critiques.  Ehrman sticks to his area of expertise and does not venture into art history or an analysis of Da Vinci's painting, \\"The Last Supper.\\" <br /> <br />But Ehrman is on solid ground when he discusses early Christianity, the role of women in the early church, Mary Magdalene, and other components of the \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" mythology.  We find, in the end, that much of what Dan Brown has put forth as fact is actually highly speculative and - in some cases - demonstrably false. <br /> <br />As I indicated, there are are books whose debunking of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is more thorough than Ehrman's, but these other books are generally written either from a traditional Roman Catholic or evangelical Protestant point of view, and are intended to defend their respective faiths.  For those who do not share those theological viewpoints, the more secular approach of Ehrman will perhaps be the most credible alternative.	2005-04-13

Encounters with the paranormal or supernatural are self-validating for those who experience them, but raise many questions for those of us who hear about them secondhand.  This book is no exception. <br /> <br />First of all, in most of these encounters, the being identified as \\"Jesus\\" does not explicitly claim to be Jesus.  Rather, the entity is assumed to be Jesus on the basis of his physical appearance, on the basis of statements which imply that he is Jesus or call to mind the words of Jesus, or - most often - because of the profound sense of love, peace, and acceptance which the being bestows. <br /> <br />\\"Jesus\\" appears in many forms, or even without a form:  sometimes his presence is merely felt and not seen;  sometimes a voice is heard, but nothing is seen;  sometimes a voice emerges from a brilliant light;  sometimes a vague human shape is seen in the midst of a brilliant light;  and sometimes Jesus appears as an apparently flesh-and-blood human being. <br /> <br />Skeptics will note that a large percentage of these encounters occur in dreams, raising the possibility of a subjective origin.  Nonetheless, a number of the experiences do occur in ordinary reality, and their life-changing nature suggest that they are more than momentary psychological abberations. <br /> <br />Traditional Christians, while open to the reality of the supernatural, may suspect that some of these encounters with \\"Jesus\\" are in fact experiences of angelic or even demonic entities.  We encounter multiple Jesuses, some of which are bizarre or disturbing, e.g., a Jesus accompanied by a flying saucer;  a Jesus who claims to be identical to the Buddha;  a Jesus who morphs into an East Indian sage;  a Jesus who counsels a woman to divorce her husband;  and - strangest of all - a bald-headed, beardless Jesus, wearing a pin-striped business suit as he speaks to a crowd in a circus tent.   <br /> <br />So this is indeed a Jesus with New Age overtones, and that fact will make him more - or less - attractive depending on the religious beliefs of the reader.  For me, the book has value as a chronicle of the paranormal, not necessarily as a conveyor of messages from the real Jesus.	2005-04-11

No, the history is quite different, and so is the current reality.  Trifkovic lays it all out in plain sight, fact by alarming fact. <br /> <br />There are people who do not want you to read this book, and who will indeed try to prevent you from reading this book.  They do not want you to know about the second-class citizenship, fear, and discrimination that is the fate of every non-Muslim living in a Muslim country.  They do not want you to know that jihad - not spiritual jihad, but militant jihad - is sanctioned both in the Koran and the Hadith (sayings of Mohammed).  <br /> <br />The book has many critics, but notice that they never point to specific factual errors.

T. Wright attempts a highly nuanced defense of Christian orthodoxy.  I say \\"highly nuanced\\" because Wright's arguments are so long and complex, and so often  interrupted with numerous asides, qualifications, and digressions, that it is often hard to pin down exactly what he is saying. When reading this book, I often found myself saying, \\"Please get to the point!\\" <br /> <br />Nonetheless, Wright does - eventually - lay down a general defense of traditional Christology, while offering insights which cast that tradition in a new light.  Some may question whether Wright does indeed stay within the bounds of Nicene theology, and I can only say that I think he INTENDS to, whether or not he actually succeeds. <br /> <br />Still, I came away from this book thinking the following thought:  how can traditional Christianity survive as a major religion if it takes hundreds of pages of complex reasoning and historical research to defend and explain one of its central dogmas, i.e., the divinity of Christ?  Does the need for Wright's erudite complexity signal that the doctrine of the Trinity is in trouble?  Perhaps it does, for the full weight of a world religion cannot stand for long on the spindly legs of complex reasoning and hair-splitting analysis.	2005-03-24

Martin is reading his own conservative theological biases into the etiology of possession, or even that these stories are modern parables created by Martin rather than factual accounts of real individuals.

Efforts to link Jesus to the Essenes are almost entirely based upon speculation and wishful thinking.  Not only do these books create unsubstantiated links between Jesus and the Essenes, they present a false, New Age caricature of the Essenes themselves.  The Essenes were a strict, ascetic Jewish cult, steeped in the Old Testament and their own apocalyptic, sectarian writings.  Few, if any, modern people could reasonably expect to identify sympathetically with their worldview. <br /> <br />But, yes, it's POSSIBLE that Jesus may have had contact with the Essenes, and may have drawn some of his followers from that group;  he may even have lived with the Essenes for some time.  But there is no firm evidence to support any of these claims.  Legitimate authorities such as the Benedictine archaelogist Bargil Pixner have speculated that Jesus had contact with urban Essenes living in Jerusalem, and these Essenes may have provided him with the room for the Last Supper.  Speculation is fine, even necessary, not to mention fun;  but we must not confuse speculation with fact.	2005-03-22

Sunstein's thesis is that the Internet fragments and personalizes information to such an extent that individuals are increasingly isolated from contrary views;  this isolation allows \\"bad\\" ideas to go unchecked, thereby promoting extremism and threatening democracy.  Sunstein proposes a series of \\"solutions\\" which are both unworkable and unnecessary, for his basic premise is flawed. <br /> <br />Contrary to Sunstein, the Internet gives people access to more, not less, information, more opinions, not fewer, and gives people more opportunities - not fewer - to challenge and respond to false or contrary information.  Chat rooms and web bloggers provide unprecedented opportunities to engage people of differing opinions, opportunities unavailable in the days when everybody sat in front of the TV and passively accepted the scripted, highly centralized news reporting of a Walter Cronkite or Dan Rather.  Sunstein seems unaware that even highly partisan websites ALREADY serve as forums for evaluating and responding to contrary viewpoints, and that bitter disputes occur even among people who share the same general philosophy.  <br /> <br />Sunstein explicitly yearns for a return to the days when network news programming would provide a \\"shared frame of reference\\" for the public;  in other words, he longs for the days when news - presented by people with views similar to his own - could function as propaganda, unquestioned by dissenting voices.  Sunstein is thus an authoritarian masking as a libertarian;  he wants to control and regulate what you see and hear.  <br /> <br />	2005-03-22

This is not a book to read while drinking beer or listening to the stereo;  the scholarship and erudition are impressive, even humbling. <br /> <br />It is staggering to think of the time, effort, meditation, and contemplation that must have gone into this book, and it will take a solid committment by the reader to give this book the slow reading that it deserves and demands.  But don't be mislead - this book is not a dry academic treatise, but a labor of love, addressing modern concerns without pandering to them.  Readers willing to approach this book with a slow hand will be well-rewarded.	2005-03-21

With a refreshing absence of pandering to contemporary sensibilities, and drawing upon the research of other scholars, Butz argues not that Jesus was a Gnostic/feminist/gay-liberationist, but rather a Jew among Jews, indeed the Messiah of Jewish expectations, for whom a mission to the Gentiles was strictly secondary and to whom the idea of founding a new religion was utterly foreign. <br /> <br />Butz thus agrees with many critics that the message of early Christianity was quickly distorted, but in ways that are comprehensible without resorting to grandiose conspiracy theories.  The primary architect of this transformation was Paul, who is depicted in the New Testament as being in conflict with the Jerusalem-based Christianity of James, the brother of Jesus.  Butz sees the Christianity of James and Peter as the earliest and most authentic form of Christianity.  This early Christianity was totally Jewish, revered the person of James, and viewed Jesus in \\"adoptionist\\" terms, i.e., not as God incarnate, but as God's elected Messiah, whose role was vindicated by the resurrection.  Butz shows that the New Testament itself provides ample evidence of a struggle between Paul and James (and Peter) to define the Christian message, a struggle which on various fronts played out for centuries and indeed continues to this day. <br /> <br />As an antidote to the highly-publicized and speculative drivel which often passes for \\"research\\" into early Christianity, this book fills a great need. Butz suggests that it is perhaps time for a \\"second reformation,\\" a reformation which takes into account the findings of modern scholarship and reexamines Christianity's relationship not only to Judaism and Islam, but to its own origins.	2005-03-07
US	51790226	RXLNLW2FHRUIS	1568215002	454250878	Turning to Torah: The Emerging Noachide Movement	Books	3	7	8	N	N	An Unfinished Quest	In \\"Turning to Torah,\\" Kimberly Hanke describes her troubled odyssey from teenage atheist to fundamentalist Christian to Torah-loving Noachide.  For those unfamiliar with the latter term, it refers to a non-Jew who follows the seven moral precepts prescribed for Gentiles by the ancient rabbis.  (In their most general form, these precepts prohibit idolatry, blasphemy, homicide, sexual immorality, theft, and taking meat from a living animal;  there is one positive requirement, i.e., to form courts of law to enforce the other precepts and maintain social order.) <br /> <br />The book is clearly written and a quick read, but leaves crucial questions unanswered.  What is Hanke's current understanding of Jesus?  If Jesus and his early followers did indeed remain committed Jews, what was Jesus's central message and why did it attract followers willing to die for it?  Does that message still have relevance today, and can a Noachide remain a follower of a Jesus understood as a Jewish prophet rather than as God incarnate?  Does modern scholarship support Hanke's uncritical attitude towards the scriptural exegesis of Orthodox Judaism?  Perhaps a second book from Hanke's competent pen could answer these questions.	2005-03-03

As always, Smoley is balanced, objective, fair, and - above all - sane.  There is nothing of the fanatic or obscurantist about Smoley, and he blends a wide knowledge of the field with bits of humor and insights gained from personal experience.  <br /> <br />Smoley is an excellent writer - intelligent and engaging, without being pedantic or superficial.  I have only one caveat about this book:  those already familiar with these topics - including former readers of \\"Gnosis\\" - might find that the book covers familiar territory and offers little that is new.  Still, even these readers might find it useful as a reference.  But for those new to these topics, you couldn't do better than start with this book;  Smoley is a trusted guide in a field too often inhabited by quacks, cultists, and uncritical enthusiasts.    <br />	2004-08-18

To me, this book was far more interesting than either of Eric Burdon's biographies, both of which spent too much time talking about his partying and too little time talking about the music.  And isn't the music what it's all about?<br />Of particular interest to me are the interviews with band members describing their opinions of the various songs the band recorded, the songs they liked and disliked, how the songs were selected, and who contributed what to the arrangements.  Also of interest are discussions of the infighting and ego-clashes that ultimately destroyed the band before its time.<br />Author Sean Egan is not shy about weighing-in with his own evaluations of particular songs, and I found myself disagreeing with him in many cases (as when he proclaims that the British take of &quot;We Gotta Get Out of This Place&quot; is superior to the version released in America).  But disagreeing about songs is part of the fun, right?  <br />Band members Hilton Valentine and John Steel come across as thoroughly likeable and down-to-earth, Chas Chandler as possessing a steady business-sense which didn't flower until after the band's demise, Alan Price as somewhat prickly and distant (he did not make himself available for interviews), and Eric Burdon as charmingly-but-maddeningly vain and unpredictable, often throwing a wrench into the band's best-laid plans. <br />I've focused on the early Animals, but the book follows the band through the Eric Burdon and The Animals psychedelic era and beyond.  This book goes a long way towards filling a void about a band that's had far too little written and said about it.	2003-10-17

Over the past 20 years numerous books, articles, movies, and television shows have convinced millions of Americans that a flying saucer crashed in the desert near Roswell, New Mexico, in the summer of 1947.  I once believed it myself.  Now, veteran researcher Kal Korff has painstakingly dismantled the elaborate construction of lies and misconceptions that have fed this modern myth, and presented for the first time a lucid and coherent account of what was really going on in the New Mexico desert back in the summer of 1947.<br />And there WERE things going on out there, but they had nothing to do with flying saucers and everything to do with the Cold War and with America's need to monitor the Soviet Union's nuclear weapons program.  But read the book.  Good research is something that there is not enough of in the field of UFO's, and Korff has done his job.  I for one believe that there is nothing at all disappointing about the truth, even if it turns out to be of the down-to-earth variety.	2000-09-27

These books were frank, gossipy, opinionated, well-written, and nicely illustrated with Stanley's  black-and-white photographs.  This new book is very much in that  tradition.<br />Now well into his 90s, Stanley has produced perhaps his final  book, a comparative look at the Grand Prix scene then and now.  Although  Stanley is grateful for the safety innovations that have prevented the  wholesale carnage of yesteryear, his sympathies lie clearly with the  drivers and traditions of the glory years.  Stanley shares the feeling of  many that big money has tarnished the sport and eliminated much of the  comaraderie and plain old fun that existed even during the years when death  on the track was all too common.<br />Readers of this book will once again see  the images of legends like Graham Hill, Count Wolfgang von Trips, Masten  Gregory, Jimmy Clark, and Stirling Moss. Whether you agree with him or not,  Stanley's pungent pen-portaits are always entertaining, and I smiled to see  personality characterizations from his earlier books reappearing here, not  always about the same person to which they were originally applied!<br />So, I  admit, there are times when Stanley shows his age.  The writing is  sometimes a bit rambling and the transitions abrupt, but the photographs  take you back too a simpler time and a nobler time.  The old BRM chief has  given us one last tribute to the sport he loves.	1999-10-13
