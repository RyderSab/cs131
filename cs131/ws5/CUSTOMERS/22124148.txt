I started all of this because I am a Stephen King fan and because my nephew bought me the first three Dark Tower books for Christmas last year (I did hestitate a little).<br /><br />I was interested from page one and knew I was hooked!  I now know I'll be finishing this series.<br /><br />As is typical of Stephen King, the characters were lovable.  However, the book got a little wordy and boring near the end.  It was somewhat confusing, as though King wasn't quite able to clearly describe what was going on in his imagination as he wrote this.  But still, the book remained interesting enough to finish, the characters were great, and I feel it's worth moving on to book number 2.	2005-09-19

The sniper kills the man because he appears to be ready to shoot his wife.  It turns out that the woman and the police sniper have psychological baggage -- lots of it.  The fact that the sniper kills the husband leads to an intense investigation, which is when all the twisting begins.  The book has a villian that you just love to hate and a lovable child and puppy.<br /><br />I actually enjoyed this book, much to my surprise.  I am usually not a fan of \\"crime format\\" books.  But the book was fairly well written, easy to read, and had some twists that made it impossible to preconceive how the book was going to end.  All in all, not a bad book -- not great -- but not bad.  A good book for reading on an airplane.<br /><br />I will say that the twists and turns became a little confusing and it was somewhat hard to follow.  Right up to the very end, I'm not sure exactly what happened.  Maybe this was the author's intention; I don't know.	2005-08-24

He is a poet who has written a book about his life, and mostly about his father's life, who fancies himself a poet also (though the jury is still out on that).<br /><br />Nick worked in a homeless shelter for years where he ran across his father who was either living on the streets or in the shelter.  His father eventually gets a little apartment and Nick visits him occasionally to check up on him.  The conversations with his father are hilarious -- although that might not have been the intention.<br /><br />The book is well written.  It does not attempt to make excuses for the father's alcoholism or homelessness.  It also doesn't attempt to make excuses for the fact that Nick did not pro-actively get his father off the streets.  It simply relays the facts in a straight-foward manner of an off-beat and bizarre life.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Excellent book and quick read.  The book reads like poetry; it is beautifully written.	2005-08-02

It's a tale about small town life that includes quite an interesting cast of characters.  The star of the show is Miles Roby who manages the local diner.  Thrown into the mix are his daughter, ex-wife, brother, father and many other locals, including the wealthy widow and her handicapped daughter.  Russo has the gift of making you love each of these characters, even though they all have flaws (most especially the father).<br /><br />The book held my attention and I enjoyed it very much.  I looked forward to my commute everyday just so I could get back to the book -- now that's saying something!  The book was witty (though everyone in my book club agrees that it is not \\"hilarious\\" as advertised) and fun.  I would recommend this Pulitzer Prize-winner to anyone.	2005-07-21

I wrote an honest review of \\"The Monk Downstairs\\" and got very negative feedback to my review!  I beg you to read this book and let me know if you honestly feel differently.  Here is my original review:<br /><br />I was not happy to be reading what was obviously going to be a romance novel for book club. But since the hero of the book was just coming out of a monastery after 20 years, I thought he might have some depth of character. I mean, just because a book is a romance doesn't mean it will be a bad book (look at \\"Wuthering Heights\\").<br /><br />But in this case it was definitely a bad book, waste of time, with extremely (and surprisingly so) shallow characters.<br /><br />This is the story of a single mom (though she's almost 40) and a 40-ish ex-monk, fresh out of the monastery. The monk rents a room in the single mom's basement and (you guessed it!) love blossoms.<br /><br />The single mom is whiny and adds nothing extraordinary to the story. As a matter of fact, she sort of insults single moms everywhere by leaning on this monk too hard and too fast. She calls him to pick up her kid at daycare all the time, even after their very first outing! And she makes references to high school and junior high school behavior over, and over, and over again. If she were not a fictional character, she would need some intense therapy.<br /><br />The monk that I thought showed promise was no better. He gets a job at McDonald's and corresponds with a fellow monk. The letters are rambling and draw no conclusions. I'm not sure why he was a monk, why he left the monastery, and how he plans to earn money since he quits his job at McDonald's in the end (hope I didn't spoil that little surprise for you).<br /><br />I was very disappointed in this book. It wasn't worth the time. I beg you, if you are itching to read a romance novel, read \\"Wuthering Heights\\" if you haven't done so already. Otherwise, turn to Danielle Steel -- I'm not a fan but can stomach her better than this.an this. <br />	2005-07-08

It is well written, to the point that it makes you short of breath at times.  It is much better than the movie.

I learned a lot of interesting things about 1) the country music star, and 2) about coming up hard and making it work out.<br /><br />This book is Loretta Lynn's tale of her childhood in Butcher Holler with her poor but pround parents.

Amazingly, she remains married to this man for the rest of his life.<br /><br />Anyway, the husband encourages Loretta to sing publicly because he thinks she has a great voice.

Four children are locked in a large attic away from their family.  The mother does not want them messing up her latest marriage to a wealthy man.  So, the inevitable happens:  the oldest brother and sister who care for the younger children, acting as parents, begin an incestuous relationship.  They are teenagers when this begins and have no contact with the outside world -- no friends, no romantic prospects.<br /><br />The topic of incest is so bothersome that it's hard to read the book, yet you don't want to put it down.  You really want to know what happens to these people in the end (and truly hope for a happy ending).<br /><br />But let me warn you:  getting through one book on incest was tolerable, but to continue the series is to put yourself through this again and again.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Great book.  I suggest you read it and then stop.  Don't bother with the rest of the series.	2005-03-23

M.M. Kaye is a beautiful writer.  Through her words you can actually see and smell India and the caravans.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Beautiful and breathtaking.  This is a romance for any reader -- even those who normally do not read romance.	2005-03-03

It combines mystery with morality and intrigue.  You cannot read this book and not be touched deeply by it.<br /><br />The basic story is seen through the eyes of a child.  This child's father is hired to represent a black man who is standing trial for raping a white woman in a racist town.<br /><br />Bottom line:  This book is excellently written and deeply moving.

Anyway, a group of teenage friends battle an evil force in their home town, and they vow to return if the evil force comes back.  This evil force appears in the form of a creepy clown that will scare the bejeepers out of you!<br /><br />Well, guess what?  The evil force comes back!  All of the friends (now middle aged) are summoned together to fight the force again.  This time they must find the core and kill it so it will never return.<br /><br />I was enjoying the friends and even the creepy clown.  But what happens in the end (I don't want to spoil it for you) is a bit of a let down.  It's like King just up and went off in a totally new direction.<br /><br />All in all, though, it was a typical Stephen King hair-raising, page gripper.  Recommended.	2005-03-01

Thomas, a Puerto Rican, becomes involved in drugs, crime, and violence -- then ending up in prison.  The manner in which he describes the events make you feel as though you've been there.

The husband wants revenge and stalks her and eventually brutally murders her.  This is where the story begins.<br /><br />The story itself is interesting enough.  And Rule does a good job of keeping your attention for a while.  But after the murder, the ensuing court case just goes on and on.  It's as though Rule has made a deal to mention everyone in the book that she interviewed, so she has to give the most intricate details of the court case in order to fit everyone in.<br /><br />Bottom line:  The TV show City Confidential could do a great job with this story (if it hasn't already), but as a book it's just plain boring.  One of the few books I was not able to finish.	2005-02-23

It was written by the DA who prosecuted Manson.  There is a lot of interesting information in this book regarding the crimes and the weird court events that followed.<br /><br />But as a book review, I'll have to say that the book was so-so.

Henry's freedom was purchased by his father.  Henry becomes close to the white man who \\"owns\\" him during the time he waits for his father to purchase his freedom.  When Henry becomes an adult, he begins to sort of emulate the white man, whom he respects and looks up to, and purchases one of his slaves.<br /><br />This book really made me think.  It raised issues that I have never heard of nor thought of before.  It even changed my views on slavery somewhat.  I have always thought, \\"shame on the white people for what they've done.\\"  But the reality of it is that slavery was not a \\"white\\" crime, it was a \\"human\\" crime.  Everyone involved in slavery was hurt by it in one form or another.  I will no longer be made to feel ashamed of my white ancestors (and I don't even know if they owned slaves -- they may have been abolishonists for all I know).  Because this ugly, ugly piece of our history belongs to all humankind.  It is to be remembered, so it will never be repeated.	2005-02-16

People begin dying left and right, and the rest of the book follows the travels of those who survive.  The survivors wander around looking for others like themselves.  This was the most interesting part of the book.<br /><br />The last part of the book becomes a quest for good vs. evil, as the survivors try to make some sort of \\"law system\\" for themselves and run across evil that is not from this world.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  This is one of the best books I have ever read.	2005-02-03

This is practically a book of three short stories, with the characters sort of intertwining throughout.<br /><br />I was thoroughly engrossed with the first of the three scenarios.  A young boy with a single mother and the old man who lived upstairs.  The old man teaches the boy about reading and many other things.  The mother is always leery of the man's attention to the boy.  This portion of the book was touching.<br /><br />The second portion of the book was okay, but not as good as the first.  It tells the story of college kids in the 60's.  One of those college kids was a friend of the little boy in the first part of the book.  The kids go in different directions, have an addiction to playing Hearts, and being involved in anti-war protests.  What I enjoyed most about this portion of the book was the look back at the sixties.<br /><br />The third part of the book was just bizarre.  I can't think of how to put it better.  It covered some Viet Nam vets in the 90's.  Of course, one of the vets had been a friend of the little boy in the first part of the book.  But something \\"science fiction\\"-like creeps in and it gets quite confusing.<br /><br />The good news is that I finished the book.  I was interested in finding out how King would tie this all together in the end.  And each story on its own was entertaining enough.  But the tying together that I was hoping for didn't really happen and I was slightly disappointed.	2005-01-26

It fictionalizes the life of a poor farmer who chooses to own land rather than material things.  Through his acquisition of land (and a hard-working, obedient wife), the poor farmer becomes a wealthy magnate and his life becomes very similar to that of the wealthy magnate from whom he originally bought the land.<br /><br />Bottom line:  I loved this book.

It just didn't hold my interest in the beginning.  In the end, I was glad I read the book.  It got more interesting as it went along, especially if you're from the Virginia mountains and can relate to the life style and scenery.<br /><br />The story centers around two children and their paralyzed mother who go to live in the Virginia hills after a car accident kills the father and damages the mother.  There they meet their grandmother who lives off the land and life is much tougher than it was in the city.  In the meantime, a court battle ensues over the grandmother's land, which causes the reader to keep reading just to find out how this will all end.<br /><br />Emotionally it seemed a little calculated and over done, but all-in-all, not a bad book.	2004-11-18

It is written around the lives of four women in a southern family, spanning several generations -- from the eccentric matriarch (who is simply comical), to the control freak mother and her dreamer of a sister, down to the troublesome, pregnant 19-year old daughter.  There is nothing really page turning about this book, and there doesn't appear to be a well thought out plot, but it was cute nonetheless.<br /><br />Warning:  The grammar will make you cringe, but somehow makes the narration more believable.	2004-11-18

Many of the characters were real, but obviously the events had to be surmised.  The town cut itself off from society so as not to spread the plague.  The novel discusses how the plague got into the town and the relationship between the towns folks as the plague began to spread.<br /><br />I was so completely interested in the subject matter after reading this book that I researched the plague, the town, and the characters.	2004-11-03

Once I started scanning the pages, I could not put the book down.  I told my mother she'd have to wait for her gift because I had become involved in reading it.

It is almost a short story.<br /><br />I first read Anita Shreve's introduction.  Anita claims to have been chasing Edith Wharton's storytelling technique throughout her own writing career.  This is evident in \\"Weight of Water.\\"<br /><br />\\"Ethan\\" is a sad story that concludes with at least one, and maybe two morals.  It is the story of a man trapped in an unhappy marriage to a hypochondriac.  When he meets his wife's cousin, he falls deeply in love and can think of nothing else.<br /><br />The book has a tragic and unexpected ending.  The ending of this short little novel is the best part of the book in my view.  Things turn out so that you think, \\"why didn't I see that coming,\\" when in fact, you didn't.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.	2004-10-28

I found that I kept reading and the book held my interest from start to finish.<br /><br />To top it all off, the ending was so unexpected and surprising that it made me want to read the book again.  I recommend this book highly, but I would not recommend it to my mother or any others with weak stomachs.	2004-10-28

What I found was that these events never occurred to him; additionally, he was a racist, a drunk, and a criminal (not to mention a famous speech writer).<br /><br />I am amazed that he was capable of writing a novel with such feeling.  I don't know how he did it.  If my comments seem bitter and untrue, search for yourself.  I was shocked what I found by simply doing a search on \\"Forrest Carter\\" in Google.	2004-10-28

As a result, I ordered \\"Ignatius Rising\\" and began reading it as soon as it arrived.<br /><br />This book taught me things I did not know about Ken Toole, but was not a fun read.  It read more like a text book.  The facts were there, they just weren't all that interesting.  (A little surprising since the events and people in Ken Toole's life seem to have been quite interesting.)<br /><br />I respect the authors for not using creative license in their storytelling, but it made the book fairly boring.<br /><br />What I enjoyed the most were the letters written by Toole and Gottleib themselves.  These letters provided more insight into the Pultizer Prize winning author than the entire rest of the book.	2004-10-28
US	22124148	RMGUO4FYNYV3F	0679736727	705453553	A Cure for Dreams	Books	4	10	10	N	N	A Sweet Little Story (and  a One Day Read)	\\"A Cure for Dreams\\" is the story of a mother's life, as told to her daughter.  The characters are lovable and the story moves quickly.  There is no actual plot or finale; it's more like a chat session between mothers and daughters.<br /><br />Though not as noteworthy as \\"Ellen Foster,\\" this book is enjoyable and I highly recommend it.  It's a small book, and due to the interesting dialogue, most readers will keep turning pages and finish on the same day they started.	2004-10-28

The book tells a fictional story of the biblical Dinah, Jacob's daughter.<br /><br />The book describes how Jacob acquired his many wives, and the relationship Dinah had with each of them, including her own biological mother.<br /><br />The book is obviously a work of fiction, but it is clear that extensive biblical research was undertaken to write it.  The author's depiction of events as they may have occurred is wonderful and tought provoking.  It disturbs me to read reviews that criticize the book for not being in agreement with a particular faith.  This was not the point of the book at all.  In my opinion, the book was written to entertain, and it does just that.<br /><br />Another plus: Anita Diamant rounded off the positive experience by following through on the all the characters in the end.	2004-10-28

I enjoy Fannie Flagg's writing, and I love the manner in which she depicts small town life.  In this book, some of the characters are lovable, with the exception of the main character, Dena.  She seems to have no personality whatsoever.  The book held my interest long enough to finish it, but the ending appeared as though Fannie sort of made it up as she went along.  All of this mystery and intrigue are built up throughout the book, only to let the reader down in the end.	2004-10-28

This is the kind of book that makes you want to overuse exclamation marks in your review!<br /><br />The vocabulary is wonderful and the main character's worldview is just plain comical.  On many occasions, I laughed out loud.<br /><br />I am sorry I will not be able to read this author again.	2004-10-28

I fell in love with the characters and cared about what happened to them.  I couldn't put it down until it was done; and then I was disappointed, but only because there was no more to read.<br /><br />I became quite interested in the author because I find it amazing and brave that she had the resources to write such a compelling work of fiction (and get it published!) in the 1930s.  I highly recommend this book.  It was thoroughly entertaining, which is the sole reason that I read.	2004-10-28

This book has to be one of my all time favorites, and I have read a lot of books in the past 30 plus years.<br /><br />The story was touching and the details superb.  The book actually made me study up a little on the Civil War.  When a book compels me to do research, I know it has had a positive impact on me.  (But don't be dismayed by this if you don't like war stories.  This is more of a love story than a Civil War novel.)<br /><br />The author's writing style is extraordinary.  I excitedly await his next novel.<br /><br />I read this book during my commute on the train.  At least once each day while I was reading the book, a commuter would come up and exclaim, \\"Wonderful book,\\" and \\"Great book.\\"<br /><br />As a final note, if you saw the movie:  Renee Zellweger didn't do Ruby justice.  Ruby is one of the most interesting characters in the novel.  Renee way overacted the part (I don't care what the Academy Awards voters say) and turned it into a comedic role.  The author's depiction of Ruby is FAR better.	2004-10-28

I borrowed it from my 24-year old daughter who reads all of his books (she especially loves \\"Jitterbug Perfume\\").<br /><br />I have to say I was bothered by the pedophilia, but not nearly as much as I was bothered by the main character trying to convince the reader why it's okay.  And trying to convince again, and again, and...<br /><br />But it was a fast moving story, fun insight on Catholicism, and just plain wacky situations, though it got a little wordy.  Sometimes, I just wanted to shout, \\"Shut up!\\"  Still, I would recommend this book, but not to the prude...	2004-10-28

She finds a home full of beekeepers who immediately take her in, and their characters are developed wonderfully -- sort of a Red Hat Society kind of group.<br /><br />As much as I enjoyed the characters, however, the events were simply absurd.  This young girl \\"springs\\" her housekeeper out of jail.  And this grown woman (the housekeeper) lets the 12 year old make all decisions as to where they're going and what they'll do next.<br /><br />All in all, a cute but absurd read.	2004-10-20

My first thought was, \\"Oh no, not another book about an 11-year old girl.\\"  But I enjoyed the character, Ellen, thoroughly and felt for her through her trials with a dead mother and abusive father.<br /><br />I also very much enjoyed the author's writing style in this book.  At first I thought the lack of punctuation would be confusing, but it only added to the charm of the book.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book, especially for book club discussions.	2004-10-20

That's Owen Meany.<br /><br />The story is narrated by Owen's best friend.  The setting switches between past and present and holds several mysteries that are all solved by the end of the book.<br /><br />The story is sweet and maintains interest throughout.  There is some political rambling about the Viet Nam \\"conflict,\\" but I actually learned something from that, too.<br /><br />After reading the book, I watched \\"Simon Birch\\" as I was told that the movie was \\"inspired by\\" the book.  The movie leaves out several interesting characters (most obvious is the omission of the narrator's punk rock cousin) and changes several important details.  I am happy that I read the book first, because I truly enjoyed reading it, and if I had seen the movie first, I would not have read the book.	2004-09-29

I found that I was even reading the footnotes and bibliography!<br /><br />The book begins with a delve into Tennessee Williams' genealogy (including a chart, which I referred to frequently while reading the book).  The author goes on to describe Tennesee's formative years, home life, and young-adulthood.  The book takes the reader up through Tennessee's overwhelming success with \\"The Glass Menagerie.\\"<br /><br />I found the book (and, therefore, Tennessee Williams) so interesting that I began researching Williams' works and also his favorite writers (Hart Crane, DH Lawrence).  I call a biography a complete success that could have such an effect as it has on me.<br /><br />I look forward to the next edition, though I wonder if it will ever be in print.	2004-09-29

The reviewer claimed to actually miss the characters after reading the book.  I enjoyed the book, that is, I finished it.  But I don't think the characters were so complex--I thought they were predictable (and somewhat obnoxious).  I also found the &quot;wrapping up&quot; of issues boring and over calculated at the end.  This is my first Gail Godwin book, so I might try another.  If it is the same, I probably won't read another.	2004-06-10

That was my assumption when I read this book.  The characters were shallow, the surprise ending was predicted, and nothing about this book was believable.  It was fast-paced, and I finished it, but it is one of the least favorite books I've read in a while.  We selected this book at my book club, and nobody seemed to enjoy it very much.  Overall, it was just ridiculous!	2004-06-10

The plot and ending were a bit disturbing, but it was an interesting read and I couldn't put it down.  I have not previously read Anita Shreve, but I will read her again.  She writes beautifully.  I found it interesting the way she switched between past and present to keep two stories going.<br /><br />I couldn't wait to find out what happened in the end, which was unexpected.  In my opinion an unexpected ending is a good quality in a book.	2004-06-10
