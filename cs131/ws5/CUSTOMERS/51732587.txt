I'm not a professional book reviewer and I realize I'm a year or two too late, but this story is unbelievable.  First of all the title, \\"A Very Private Woman\\", is completely misleading.  Mary Meyer was not a very private woman she was an exhibitionist of the first rate.  Her attempts at being \\"different\\" appear to merely be efforts to be recognized. From her early beginnings in a completely disfunctional family, to her own disfunctional family she continued to show herself as one who demanded recognition and would do anything to get it.  If anyone wonders what's gone wrong in this country read this book about Mary Meyer and her many associates who appeared to be adulterers, alcoholics, druggies, and anything else you can think of, while at the same time deciding what the course of the country should be.  Really unbelievable!	2005-08-30

He's easy to read, thorough, and gives one a really good summary of what happened in our past, and there's no bias.  He's not a revisionist, but a factual teller of the story.  I would recommend any of his books to anyone who asked....in fact even if they didn't ask.	2005-08-19

I liked this book because it was kind of like reading the \\"Enquirer\\" in novel form.  It certainly is not an historical novel, but it's filled with gossipy type info that we all seem to like.  Is also shows that this group was like no other that we have seen.  A buddy becomes president and they all jump on the band wagon for the \\"good times\\", all the hangers-on...can't say as I blame them. It also shows that the whole thing centered around the Kennedys, either you were with them or you were against them...no two ways about it. They had the money, they had the influence, and they were leading the royal life...probably the closest we've come to royalty...or at least they thought they were.  However the consequences they suffered, divorce, alcoholism, womanizing etc. shows that the good times come to an end and life goes on with or without them.  Most of them amounted to very little...it shows that probably Jackie was the only one with any brains, and probably wondered \\"what the hell is going on around here?\\"....I would still recommend this book as an interesting read.	2005-08-18

Another example of the outstanding courage and heroism shown by many during WWII.  To think a small band of men from the streets and villages of the USA, perhaps mostly draftees, could put themselves up against one of history's greatest armies and come out successful.

Although having a personal interest Wylie does accomplish the fact that Anotoli Boukreev was greatly denigrated by Jon Krakauer in his Into Thin Air while only mentioning the fact once.....Rowell's being associated with the book convinced me of Boukreev's authenticity....he was truly a mountaineer...I think Krakauer recognized this fact but because of his bias and his paycheck together with his group's failure on Everest he felt compelled to place the blame. He apparently failed to accomplish this as evidenced by the awards and accolades Boukreev received by other mountaineers.....but Boukreev was his victim and all Krakauer was looking for was an American audience, and as I said, a paycheck.......This book is not an attempt to portray Boukreev as he wasn't but accomplished to show Boukreev as he really was, truly an outstanding individual....truly and individual....his returning to the mountain to find Scott Fisher and Yasuko Namba only indicates the person he was......	2005-04-28

I'm not a diver of any type but this is a great story. The author does a great job in bringing you again and again to the scene, and does it in a smooth and joined way. Here were two guys, Chatterton and Kohler, who couldn't stomach each other and by the end of the book were close companions. To me the book showed a group of people (divers) who apparently for many reasons worked individually, but in this instance Chatterton and Kohler became a team and their success was certainly a joint effort. Both are to be commended. The book also shows us that our \\"enemies\\" were also only doing their duty, with bravery and heroism. Kohler is to be commended for pursuing and finding family members of the crew of the U-869.How grateful they must have been.  (But please don't compare this story with Krakuers's Thin Air....I have read both and find no comparison...Thin Air was a  an effort to place the blame for a disaster....)	2004-09-17

I wonder if anyone has ever questioned O'Neill and his buddies?  I guess they were the real goodie goodie two shoes eh? Obviously O\\"Neill enjoyed the notoriety he was getting, especially being in the spotlight.  Of course having a president pat him on the back had nothing to do with it.

Flyboys is indeed a worthwhile book, however I think Mr. Bradley should have done more work on his script prior to publication. I don't think a book of this type needed to start with a history lesson on the reasons the Japanese thought as they did, to prepare us for what was to follow. I also am puzzled by the fact that Bradely seems to relate all the Japanese atrocities to those allegedly committed by Americans in the past. He seems to excuse the behavior of those Japanese on Cichi Jima because they were \\"ordered\\" to perform these actions. I must say he has left me with less respect for the Japanese now than I had before.  I think this book will only serve to reinstitute a bad feeling toward to Japanese. I don't believe Mr. Bradley did a service to anyone by the tone he used in writing this book.  He \\"mandates\\" forgiveness. I don't think he can do this. The Japanese initiated the war, I don't believe everyone in Japan was kept in the dark by their military leaders. I feel they knew and they agreed. They then suffered the consequences. I am sure they accepted them with their usual resolve.	2004-01-20

Obviously she considered the Presidency a dual position which she graciously shared with her husband.  She is obviously very smart and will be the first to tell you so.  The book is also interesting as to what has been left out.  Although she apparently doesn't consider it so, her term as first lady of Arkansas was a turbulent one, however she skims over that Her disgust with her husband over the Monica incident stems, it seems, not so much over the fact that he had violated his vows to her, but that he had seemingly ruined the partnership they had as co-presidents.  No wonder she gulped for air. She also seems to breeze through the Impeachment too quickly. No doubt this is but a forerunner to her announcing her own intention to \\"continue\\" her Presidency.

Ms. Olson spends a great deal of time trying to convince everyone that the Clinton's and the Democrats were nasty people.  She forgets that although Clinton was impeached he was found NOT GUILTY.

No so, we really enjoyed some good living while the Clinton's were there. I believe if she went back in time other President's, i.e. Nixon, would make the Clinton's look like a bunch of amateurs.

I  don't think Mr. Germond was quite the principled person that he would have  you believe him to be. He has a tendency to be too self-effacing to be  true. But, I still read the book and enjoyed it.	2000-03-02

His calmness under pressure and his ingenuity are superb. They don't make them like that anymore. I wonder if under today's standards Mr. Momsen would be allowed  the latitude and patience that was afforded him then.  Again, a great  story.	2000-01-13

At last someone who is willing to give Anotoli Boukreev the credit he deserves. This is an excellently written narrative. Y ou don't find the chest thumping here that was found in &quot;Into Thin Air&quot;. Instread  Dickinson recognizes Krakauer and Boukreev for what they really were, a  writer and a hero.  Good reading and I agree it will become one of the  classics.	2000-01-06

This is a great book, and a reminder that the stories that are out there need to be told so that future generations can have some appreciation of what they were given.  Think of the number of families that have stories to  tell that have gone untold. This book should encourage anyone who has a  story to tell it. Tom Brokaw is to be congratulated for opening the  floodgates.	2000-01-06

Writing style makes for easy reading and understanding. I don't quite know how Durr's family takes to his exploits, but he seems to be having a good time chasing  his dream. More power too him.  Would recommend it to anyone wanting to  read about a guy doing his own thing.	1999-11-25

IF YOU WANT TO BECOME A MYSGTERY FAN YOU CAN'T DO ANY BETTER THAN JOE GUNTHER, ARCHER MAYOR'S DETECTIVE.  I THINK ALL OF ARCHER MAYOR'S BOOKS ARE GREAT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT ONE. THE ONLY  THING THAT I WISH IS THAT JOE GUNTHER WOULD GET A LITTLE TOUGHER, HE SEEMS  TO BE TOO NICE A GUY FOR A DETECTIVE. AT TIMES HE APPEARS TO BE ALMOST A  STUMBLEBUM, BUT THEN HE ALWAYS COMES THROUGH I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ANY OF  ARCHER MAYOR'S DETECTIVE NOVELS.	1999-04-23
