It seems like Tyler is more determined to be anti-herb than anything else, shunning even herbs that have been shown to be safe in numerous studies and years of use. He even goes as far as to be smugly insulting toward modern herbalists with some of his comments. Countless errors decorate the pages - or should I say soil them? - and there's really nothing I can say about this book that would get this taste out of my mouth. [...]<br />It's true we need to get the word out about this book, but not as a recommended read.	2005-09-28
US	51735249	R17JVXOX2ERJIR	0843924683	896623096	Evil Offspring	Books	4	2	2	N	N	An amazing supernatural story that shouldn't be missed!	The older book, released in 1987, was a great treat to revisit. The plot is unique and not as cheesy as the back blurb makes it sound. You have two siblings who feel a need to return to the old house they grew up in, where they were raised by their intelligent, powerful, and twisted grandfather. Years ago, the house partially burned down, destroying both the grandfather and the sadistic, overweight &#8216;offspring&#8217;. The younger of the two siblings, Peggy, has huge gaps in her memory that she can&#8217;t fill while her brother, Eric, remembers but won&#8217;t tell.<br /><br />Together they return to the house, along with Jennie, Eric&#8217;s girlfriend with a secret motive of her own, and Peggy&#8217;s protective but stereotypical jock boyfriend Danny. Once there nightmares await them, things they can&#8217;t put their fingers on, and they soon find that even if they wanted to, they couldn&#8217;t really leave. They have to stay and fight this thing to the finish&#8230;or else lose their lives in the process.<br /><br />The plot, while nothing groundbreaking, is interesting and fun. The revelation of what the &#8216;offspring&#8217; really is at the end is slightly confusing but it&#8217;s an imaginative fit. From the first to the last, mystery and intrigue coats the pages. It&#8217;s hard to figure out exactly what is going down, and this kept me reading. While not the most severe and violent incidents happened throughout the novel, they were all still disturbingly entertaining. The ending was a suitable finish, not a happy go lucky ending that&#8217;s sugar coated.<br /><br />The villain itself is morbid, obese, and creepy. Regrettably, it is also slightly irritating, and I didn&#8217;t keep reading simply for it. The characters are realistic and with personality quirks of their own, being fun to read about and follow through. If a character died, I mourned their death; this is as it should be.<br />Haunted houses and the supernatural are always fascinating; we have everything from the classic s&eacute;ance, to the buried graves, to the strange poltergeist activities. But there&#8217;s more than the simple hocus pocus we&#8217;re all so familiar with &#8211; this story is full of unusual and surprising developments as well.<br /><br />Williamsons&#8217; style is clever. It&#8217;s stylish, arty, and easy to read. His &#8216;voice&#8217; is endearing and well suited for this type of work.<br /><br />If you&#8217;re a fan of the supernatural, I recommend finding an old copy of &#8216;The Offspring&#8217;. J.N. Williamson is a talented author who I understand is now ill. I pray for his well being, and thank him for leaving us so many books to enjoy for years to come.classic sance, to the buried graves, to the strange poltergeist activities.

I see from the other reviewers that it didn't them, but oh well. Can't fit in all the time.<br /><br />One of my main problems with this novel was the rather silly idea. It kind of smelled like a lifetime movie gone bad. When I read the back of this book to someone, once we reached, &#8220;and there&#8217;s a blizzard outside, they laughed and said, &#8220;Oh, of course.&#8221;<br /><br />The atmosphere was tense, so I can understand why so many compliment the suspense of the novel. I agree, it was there, it was strong. The only thing is it was overdone. Yes, suspense can be overdone. If you have most of the book written in the same mode of tension, never letting up, never giving the reader a breather, after awhile the effect wears off.  From the beginning of the novel to the end we have the two protagonists battling the same chances for over a hundred pages. After all this is constantly whirling around, the tension loosens as it just grows tiring.<br /><br />The characters work well and the pace is not choppy or lagging. Koontzs' style of writing is as captivating at ever.<br /><br />Overall the tension was great, at first...but then it just gets buried under the stereotypical blizzard snow. Read another Koontz if you want to give him a try - he really is great, but this one was too formulaic and overdone to succeed.	2005-02-28

I mean, I had  heard he was the greatest thing this side of horror, but just wasn&#8217;t feeling it.  After reading \\"Endless Nights,\\" however, I just might jump on the Laymon happy go<br /><br />lucky bandwagon after all!<br /><br />The book starts off with horror and ends with even worse horror. From the very first few pages, tension is high enough to induce a nervous breakdown in the reader.<br /><br />Laymon whips up a dessert full of dark atmosphere, rich characters, smooth pacing,  and mouth- watering suspense. This book is a little long when you look at it from a side view, but when you're reading it, you'd never notice the length because you're so preoccupied with what you're reading. Most of the pages are blood-soaked; Laymon doesn't hesitate to describe the violence and horrible happenings in gruesome, unflinching detail.<br /><br />If you want to jump into Laymon, make Endless Night your intended spot. Read it once, read it again, and then lock it away for safe keeping!	2005-02-28

The beginning got me hooked, the middle kept me there, and the ending was strong.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Smith uses a simple, straightforward manner to inject<br /><br />his poison in the reader&#8217;s bloodstream. His prose is pronounced, clear, and focused.<br /><br />The pace starts off swift and strong, stays in the air the whole way through, keeps lifting higher and higher, never putting its feet down on the ground.<br /><br />Some of the events are almost offensive they're so disturbing, and while on the surface this plot looks generic, it's certainly not.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Smith misses the mark with his characters. Dreamweaver comes off weak and whiny, Master is a good character but a bit confusing, Mrs. Wickman is too stereotypical to be believed, and all the really good characters were killed off too soon or not explored enough.<br /><br />The dialogue worked sometimes, but other times it just...well, gee, golly, gosh, fizzled out.<br /><br />Overall though, this gets a high marking. I recommend it to all horror fans - read this one when you get the chance, it's not for the birds.	2005-02-28

This book excels in the strange and demented, but it never crosses that 'mediocre' line.<br /><br />It&#8217;s hard to place a finger on the exact soft spots, but<br /><br />basically the story is a bit lengthy for its kind(even though it&#8217;s not a large book to begin with), and could have been wrapped up quicker in a more entertaining manner. The pace keeps up at a rapid pace, so it can&#8217;t be faulted, it&#8217;s just that the traditional twists of &#8216;Lelia&#8217; get old quick. New scenarios would have helped, and I didn&#8217;t care as much about some of the characters as I should have, causing me to grow impatient with their scenes (Hello, Jordan)<br /><br />I will say one thing for sure, and that is that no one exaggerated the brutality of his work, how far out he went with slayings and horrid imagery, not censoring his work.<br /><br />This is the first and only time Ketchum went through supernatural route - this just didn't click with me, although it may with you.	2005-02-28

By desciption alone, the plot isn't bad, but it's not terribly interesting to read about. There was just no magic here. I read the events, didnt care about them, didnt care about the characters, and didnt really care about the outcome. This was one of those novels I read for awhile, and kept coming back to after reading another book to finish. I was just bored...I can't put my finger on why exactly, but it's a truth. The pace would speed up, then slow down again, repeating it's vicious cycle.<br /><br />My advice? If you're wanting to sample Little, try one of his other books instead, like the House of the Revelation.	2005-02-28
US	51735249	RGMRRH5NAC88	0843951575	451787490	In This Skin	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Clark is quickly becoming a favorite author...	While this isn't quite as good as his amazing Stranger, In This Skin kept me glued to the couch, lounging around and being lazy all day as I read. (Like that's anything new but hey, saying this book is good gives me a believable excuse)<br /><br />The plot is complex, unsettling, covered with a mysterious, dreamy-like atmosphere. Wiggling around in this foggy soup are characters that stand out, with credible motives for their actions, realistic goals, and I cared about each. The 'creatures' were shivery and unique.<br /><br />As for the pace, In This Skin started out with swift, hard kicks, never letting up, ending with a final bang that could be<br /><br />felt through the entire length of my spine. Clarks writing style is not weighed down by unneeded 'pretty phrases' - instead he's focus, determined, and powerful.<br /><br />The only real flaw I can see is that sometimes the characters are a bit dumb, but hey, not much is perfect. This one tantalized my mind and kept my blood roaring through my ears - what more could a horror reader ask for?	2005-02-28
US	51735249	R3DJ3390KUGSLT	0843948574	235941502	Naomi	Books	2	2	4	N	N	Dissapointing	I am a huge fan of Cleggs and always heard this one is one of his best. Unfortunately, that rumor didn't prove to me to be true.<br /><br />The story held promise, in a way - its fun to read about witches from older times and some of the characters, like Maddie, are easy to latch on to. For the bad side of things, other characters weren't given the focus they deserved, the story was muddled and poorly paced too much of the time, and a lot of it was just plain confusing.<br /><br />The style is a bit too distant and literary, and some of the action in certain scenes was uneven. The ending was a slight saving grace, being strong with it's impact. If you're a fan of Clegg, give this one a try, but if you're a virgin of his work, try another by him instead.	2005-02-28

Jackson weaves an intriguing tale that goes slowly but smoothly through the motions. The book isn't filled with creepy scenarios, but when they do happen, they're big. Mainly The Haunting of Hill House<br /><br />is a character driven story, focusing on the internal issues of each character, mainly Eleanors.<br /><br />The ending was a surprise, leaving me feel a hollow feeling in my chest. Although it's not filled with action, The Haunting of hill house is disturbing and will keep the reader enthralled. Check it out.	2005-02-28

I wasn&#8217;t disappointed reading through this, but I suspect Wilson offers better stuff. Wilsons style is direct and unhurried, a delight to read. The characters are real enough, but not amazing. The pacing is steadily climbing uphill, and I found no fault there. Not much suspense was built throughout, and the villain and 'secrets' were all known upfront to the reader before the protagonist had it figured out. I didn't enjoy the relationship between Gina and Gerry much - it came across as contrived and much too predictable.  The story isn&#8217;t<br /><br />unpredictable by any means, but it&#8217;s still a fun little thriller.	2005-02-28

The plot wasn't as thrilling as Night Cage, but otherwise it still had many of the same strengths. The plot packed punch, didn't run out of steam, kept going like the little engine that could.<br /><br />While Clegg went a bit overboard at the beginning with choppiness in his wording, he evens out and left me an enthused, pleased reader. Some repition in the novel hurt it a little bit, but otherwise the pacing was smooth and solid.<br /><br />There wasn't that much suspense here, but it held a lot of spirit and strength, making my literary life a little bit happier.	2005-02-28

The &#8220;fight&#8221; itself lasted awhile and then abruptly exploded.<br /><br />While not an award winner, The Wyrm is a book worth hunting down. It tells the story of an ancient creature letting loose its havoc on a small town, killing and terrorizing many. The Wyrm speaks of pure evil, and, while done with a one-dimensional touch, manages to entertain after all.	2005-02-28

Hoffman digs deeply into the minds of his characters and, whether or not you agree with their actions or not, they're still interesting. You don't always have to agree with the actions of the protagonist(s) to enjoy a book. These characters are not stereotypical, they are purely three dimensional, unusual, and fascinating.<br /><br />The suspense really isn't that strong, it's not THAT type of thriller. Everything's intriguing though, there's lots of action going down, and the subject matter hasn't been touched upon in this way that much.  Much of it is soaked with mental thoughts and ambitions, a very character driven story.<br /><br />Hoffman has a powerful voice that should be listened to.	2005-02-28

This man can take a horrible event and make it SOUND picturesque. The cenobites are here in all their glory, but they're not shown enough for my liking, and aren't sketched out one bit. The other characters also aren't - they seemed to be multi-dimensional but not enough is known about them. The pace of the novel is strong and swift, but it could have worked out better in a longer length. One thing that remains memorable is the superb atmosphere; dark, damp, depressing, gripping, haunting, and so much more than even that. This is an entertaining, thought-provoking book that disturbs, creeps the reader out, and keeps them reading - but it's just not that memorable when everything is said and done.	2005-02-28

The characters are written well and in depth; the suspense and horror are strong, the drama is high when shown - I even cried at one scene involving Thomas.<br /><br />The middle and end paid off big time, keeping me flipping through the pages. On bad points, The Bad Place was a little hard to get into because of how outlandish the story was at first. I was confused, and didn't want to dig that much to get 'into it'. The pace was hurt a bit at first for this reason, but it quickly sped up when I got the just of what was going on.  I didn&#8217;t warm up to<br /><br />the novel until a few chapters had passed, and then I was caught, ensnared in the trap Koontz had so artfully weaved. Heart-stopping action was continuous, pounding itself mercilessly upon the pages, keeping the story going full blast.<br /><br />As always, Koontzs' style of writing is strong and impactual. His way with words if fantastic.  As always with his work, it injects real lessons, and one thing rings clear when reading this: Life is hard, life is rough, but it is still life, and because of this, we have no choice but to grin and bear it, surviving as<br /><br />best as we can.<br /><br />I recommend this book highly to all Koontz fans; just endure the storm for awhile, then it pays off.	2005-02-28

Being in Olivias head was different, to say the least. If you're a tragedy hound and want to experience heartbreak, then this is your book.<br /><br />For negatives, some of the writing was a bit too flowery, even for Andrews. Some of the writing was a bit repititive, which interrupted the flow. Also, the beginning was pretty slow to get through, even though it was still eventful.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone starting the series - it explains a lot and packs a lot of punch.	2005-02-28

I advise not being put off by its seemingly childlike innocence; this one features monstrous beings, cruel twists of fate, and genuinely frightening outcomes. All ages can enjoy Thief of Always, for it stirs up the imagination and brings back that child in all of us.<br /><br />With imaginative scenarios, cute little characters, and an all-out showdown to beat other show-downs, Theif of always is worth a read. The setting is of a fascinating, mystical, storybook house. With some minor plot similarities to The Haunting where the house is concerned, we learn through Harvey's eyes what is what and a small mystery is solved.<br /><br />It's not without its flaws, though - every house has its holes.<br /><br />One pet peeve is that no one believed Harvey - it's a complaint of mine when that happens to people in either books or movies. And even though it's not supposed to be full of tension and action the whole way through, sometimes it dragged TOO much, to where I nearly got bored.<br /><br />Overall, great stuff to have fun with, and a wonderful trip down memory lane - a reminder that things don't have to be complex and sophisticated in order to be disturbing and creepy.<br /><br />Great stuff to have fun with, and a wonderful trip down memory lane - a reminder that things don't have to be complex and sophisticated in order to be disturbing and creepy.	2005-02-28

At first when I began reading the book I couldn&#8217;t figure out how it could be done without looking hokey or cheesy. Thankfully Cacek did inject some intelligence into her story.<br /><br />Characters were convincing, some easier to latch on to than others. The pace was pretty even - things kept up once they started going. Cacek&#8217;s style is simple but also written well. It makes easy, light reading with some great play on words.<br /><br />While The Wind Caller may not stand out in my mind a year from now, it was still an entertaining book to go through. The idea was original, the characters worthy, and the ending shocking.  Go ahead and pick it up - not the most memorable thing but you&#8217;ve never read anything quite like it, either.	2005-02-28

I read so many books, they become like broken records after awhile. Fear, however, always stayed with me. I loved it then, and after I found another copy recently, I love it now just as much.<br /><br />It reads almost like an adult fairy tale type. Young adults could read and enjoy this one as much as adults, but that shouldn't put off the 'grown up' readers. It almost seems like Kelly took every horrible thing he could think of out of his brain and placed it in this book. There&#8217;s not just one monster there&#8217;s this one, that one, and even that one over there. The atmosphere in different areas of the county the woods, or the water, or the cabin all were amazing.<br /><br />Much of the beginning is focused on the internal issues Jeb has, so some may feel impatient to get the action moving, but while there isn't as much action present, it was all interesting and fun. I really felt drawn to the characters in a real, emotional way, cheering them on the whole time.<br /><br /> Dialogue is told through a small-town, hickish type dialect, with words such as \\"'ol,\\" \\"how're,\\" \\"gonna,\\" and \\"dangrum.\\" Surprisingly this doesn't get annoying. The style of writing is easily comprehended, straightforward, and consistent. The ending was one that was happy and miserable at the same time. Kelly relies on as much internal dialogue as external. \\"Fear\\" is written in multiple POV viewpoints, mainly third person flexible, but the majority is seen through the eyes of the child 'Jeb.'<br /><br />I heard from somewhere that Kelly hasn&#8217;t been writing anymore; if this is true, it&#8217;s a shame, because he has talent.	2005-02-28

THIS plot is nothing simple; it turns out to be creative ,and unpredictable as hell, and I stand with applause for the hours he must have spent brainstorming this one.<br /><br />Neverland is fun, twisted, gripping. I fell in love with the characters, I weeped with them, I feared for them. The setting with the old house, the creepy shack, the woods - all amazing, beautiful, unnerving. The pace is quick when it should be, slower when its appropriate, and overall ends with a stunning conclusion. Clegg writes with a hand that holds talent, knowing how to work its stuff.<br /><br />Read Neverland for a good time, an imaginative roll in the hay. You won't be dissapointed.	2005-02-28

You also don&#8217;t have a constantly shifting creature raging against his inner impulses; there&#8217;s no moon watching here, no silver bullets to be dodged, and no strange herbs to devour to fend off any curses.<br /><br />Characters are interesting and unique. It's not often you read about a protagonist who can't make it well in the real world. I loved this sense of realism!<br /><br />Strieber writes with a heavy hand at times, spinning out colorful phrases. His wording is intriguing, his style serious. He does inject humor in the story when it&#8217;s needed, a type of irony, but does so in a way that seems to come naturally. At first his style was a bit hard for me to get into, but pretty soon I was wrapped up and began looking forward to it.<br /><br />The wild, not your typical horror novel, one that devotes itself mainly to change, human nature, and acceptance, reads like a dark drama. It&#8217;s not a werewolf story per se, so don&#8217;t go in expecting this to be unleashed, but it&#8217;s a satisfying one nonetheless. For a change we needed a different bite of wolf in our horror; this may be what some have been waiting for.	2005-02-28

I was happy to see the book didn't focus on this mental disorder too much, veering off instead to other characters lives and their purpose in this novel. I have to admit it took me awhile to stay focused. The beginning was confusing, not that interesting, and<br /><br />misled. The middle spiced things up more, with intriguing things events, a few grueling murders, and issues made more clear. I especially loved the diary of Elizabeth; a novel written from her point of view would have been enjoyable indeed. The ending was a<br /><br />cool wrap up, furthering the tension the middle contained, ending everything on a depressing and unpredictable note.<br /><br />Overall, this is a delightful horror novel (if that makes sense), one worth checking out and enjoying.	2005-02-28

It's addictive, thrilling, and well written. The characters are strong and easily latched on to (except Shara gets on my nerves a little at times.) A lot happens, and the ending was an incredible finish. An excellent sequel to Hungry Eyes, if you were left wanting more -- this is a great runner up.

And wow some more.<br /><br />This book has an amazing plot for a young adult thriller. In fact, I would recommend it to just about any adult I know.<br /><br />The story is amazing. There's twists, bends, curves, scrapes, and bumps. The ending is a shocker of sorts, each scene is an unpredictable event that makes your heart beat with more than just suspense, but pure emotion - yes, definately emotion. I even cried. Twice. (Or maybe more times...yes, I'm a softie, what can I say??)<br /><br />I don't care that this is a YA, this one was INTELLIGENT. Plenty of hidden meanings, commentaries, explorations of life. Again, wow.<br /><br />The atmosphere was simply frustrating and depressing - good!<br /><br />Characters were convincing, I loved nearly every one. Pike writes amazingly well. Sometimes he has long paragraphs with stylish words that could be almost considered poetry  - other times it's shorter and clear, forward and to the point.<br /><br />This type of work, with its creativity, originality, genuineness,<br /><br />and passion - is, and forever remains, timeless.	2005-02-28

I've owned this for years and have read it twice now, it's an addictive, intelligent book I'd recommend to all.<br /><br />The plot may seem far fetched and rather silly from the back cover blurb, but truthfully it's anything but. Action starts at the beginning, I was kept reading to the end, shivering when the last page was turned. The beginning held foreshadowing on what was to come, the middle never sagged or left me down, and the ending was powerful, sad, haunting.<br /><br />There were great moral type lessons in the story, as well as warnings, and explorations of what man should not mess with, when we got too far, and the price of advancement.<br /><br />In some of Neidermans books, I couldnt get into the characters much, such as in Perfect Little Angels. Here, though, he does a commendable job. Lois and her family were convincing enough to work.<br /><br />Even though Brain Child isn't one full of suspense and nail-biting tension, the pace didn't suffer. Enough was kept happening to make me glued to the pages, it just wasn't full of flash and dazzle. Even so, it was entertaining because it was so fascinating. I don't always need gripping anguish, violence, and morbid imagery to enjoy my horror.<br /><br />Neiderman's writing style was easy to understand and straight forward. Overall, this is most likely my favorite novel by the author to date. It saddens me more haven't read, enjoyed, and reviewed this. I literally read it in two sittings, having to take a break only because it was time for dinner...dinner with the family -- brings new meaning once this book is read!	2005-02-28

The characters are well written, the suspense is tight, the pacing swift, the ending brutal, and the middle never lags one bit. As always, Koontz injects moral lessons in his work, and they're hard to miss, but never preached to you. This novel is not as dark as some of Koontzs other stuff, but the atmosphere fits the plot.

US	51735249	R24JSQG913GRC	0843948302	995246562	Voice of the Blood	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Good but not moving	The plot of this one may seem like an everyday vampire novel from first glance but thankfully it's a lot different once you bite in. There is one thing about this book that is slightly out of the norm: it definitely focuses on the sexual side of both humanity and vampires. While this isn't really different from any other vampire tale, what makes it stand out is that it's loaded with it. There are explicit details, naughty dialogue, and a high number of sexual encounters, from the first chapter to basically the last one. Not to mention not all of the sex is even straight; I wouldn't call this one PG-13. But it is erotic.<br /><br />The style of the writing was fast-paced and to the point. The transition between chapters was done well, and the overlying mood was dark but also fun and light. It's no easy feat to blend all those in one novel, but Jefferson manages to make it his craft.<br /><br />It dropped two stars simply because there wasn't enough substance for my taste. It offered what it offered and that's that. There were no hidden meanings, surprising twists, mysteries to solve, crimes to stop, dreams to plunge or lives to destroy - it was a pretty basic story filled with sex and minor emotional dilemma, nothing much else.	2005-02-28

The atmosphere well crafted for this type of novel; not overly dipped in dark and dreary undertones, it still does manage to convince that its horror, and well-done horror at that. All of the characters have their strong points.<br /><br />The novel, being a large one, doesn't jump right into the boiling pot at the get-go. Instead it takes a bit of its time to get to the potent stuff, but from the beginning the character development is powerful enough to take me under its spell.<br /><br />Passarellas' writing style is easily digestible and clear. His suspenseful moments are well written and paced, his slower scenes still stay interesting, and the finale plays off as a worthy finish to a great book.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and pick up your own copy of Wither.	2005-02-28

Although sometimes it did seem Bentley did try for shock effect a little too much, this book was stil unique, creepy as hell, and will never be forgotten by anyone who reads it. The little girl is chilling and just plain nasty...I felt like a good long shower after reading this one. The plot is a complex maze you won't be able to figure out until the ending. Characters seemed genuine. The atmosphere was just plain dark and almost...forbidden. The pages are almost visually covered in grime and nastiness.	2005-02-28

Although the very end is a small let down, the majority of this book holds firm and scared the sh*t out of me. There's more gore than one can handle, grisly imagery - it's simply mind-numbing.<br /><br />One thing that really works here is the atmosphere - most novels out there don't pack this much punch, that's for sure. It will have you looking over your shoulder before the night is through.<br /><br />Each character rang the realistic bell; good job here.<br /><br />Little stumbles sometimes, but all is forgiven by the time I came to the last chapter. Read this for yourself and see what I mean, but be warned - Little is not for the weak of stomach (or mind).	2005-02-28
US	51735249	R1TM8N6J4F4JXF	0843954124	996157105	Flesh Gothic	Books	4	8	11	N	N	Superb Stuff	Flesh Gothic is a powerfully written roller coaster, loaded with gore, sex, viciousness, and amazing imagery. Although the plot isn't propelled by 100 mile an hour action, it still grips the throat, dries the mouth, and tantalizes the morbid senses. The story was cloaked in mystery, even to the point of 'red herrings', with finely chiseled characterization, psychologically-addictive hooks, and in-your-face commentary. It kept me reading, so it did it's job, almost too well.<br /><br />This isn't for prudish readers - but if you want your horror hot and heavy, unrelenting and fierce, try this one. It won't let down even the most jaded fans.	2005-02-28

A book worth reading, that's what!<br /><br />Bentley Littles 'The Circle' starts off the fun. Although different, dark, twisted, and out there, it skids off the road a bit too much at times. I couldn't get into the characters, some of the imagery painted seemed overdone to the point of writing it just to shock the reader, and the ending left me disturbed, not necessarily in a good way.<br /><br />Christopher Goldens' Pyre was an occupying, fascinating tale about a young girl who, after losing her father, goes over the edge to bring him back for a showdown. The theme was pure bliss, making me want to read more, more, and even more when it was all done with. The characters were convincingly written, multi-dimensional, and lingering. Goldens' writing style is both fierce and strong.<br /><br />Tom Piccirilli's Jonah Arose is a mixed blessing. The story didn't do it for me, but it was written with a talented hand. The wording was as smooth as butter, the characterization was potent, and the ending strange. It just took a bit too long to get off, I was confused much of the time, since the tale was so 'out there'.<br /><br />The last offering, Douglas Cleggs' The Words, ties in with Goldens as the winner. Intriguing, different, suspenseful, and creepy, it's a simple tale that holds much more beneath the surface.<br /><br />In the mood for a good horror anthology? How can you go wrong with four in-depth novellas from these authors? Simple - you can't.	2005-02-28

It all plays out like a fun ride until the bodies begin to pop up, innocents begin to die and people are changed into<br /><br />monsters of their own by their past mistakes. This novel stays true to life and because of that it works. \\"The Funhouse\\" starts out with a bang and keeps on kicking, the beginning fumes getting you high off its strength.<br /><br />To close this carnival down, I have to say it truly shines. The ending is a slight let down after having such an impressive build up, but this can be overlooked when it&#8217;s all clumped together. When the last door of the carnival is locked, every last mark has gone home and is now safely snug in their beds, \\"The Funhouse\\" gets the rating of an event akin to sitting on an intense roller coaster that delivers all it originally promised.	2005-02-28

Sure, I wondered what Chris' moms role was with the key, and sure, I would have liked it explained, but you know what? This is a good book, and not everything has to be handed to me on a silver platter, explaining the whos, whys, and whats of the world. Yeah, not everything was explained in detail, but nothing major - this does not ruin a good book.<br /><br />Minor plot holes aside, I found the plot to be original enough, well executed, some nice twist and turns in there, with no cheap plot ploys tossed into the batch. It was unpredictable - I NEVER saw the end result coming.<br /><br />The characters were strong and smart, being a pleasure to read about. They complimented the story and took it in all directions full force. The pace is quick, starts off almost immediately, never letting up.<br /><br />The atmosphere is rich with suspense, plenty of creepiness in there. Tension was thick, lots of action, drama, even minor budding romance cues.<br /><br />With gripping suspense, enthralling events, sympathetic characters, an<br /><br />admirable writing style and almost endless flow of sheer horror (while being fun) - \\"Possessions\\"<br /><br />is not a snack for a starving horror fan to miss!	2005-02-28

Recommended	Strangers is chocked full of action, mystery, intrigue, creepy as hell moments, strong-willed characters with concrete goals, and a<br /><br />few moving, emotional moments. The ending is a little too convenient in a way, but it doesn't bring down the rest of the book.<br /><br />I love apocalyptic tales; this one certainly didn't dissapoint. Clarks words flow together well to weave a story that's full of tension and angst. As for pace, something is always happening.<br /><br />I recommend this to everyone - even though it DOES have holes, who cares when its this good?? Pick it up immediately!	2005-02-28

The reader is treated with the past history of the character, the present, and journal tidbits. This manner leads to a convoluted, confusing tale that kept<br /><br />my mind dancing along the edges of sanity as I followed in the footsteps of the mains characters trials.<br /><br />While the tale is exciting, forboding, and filled with dark memories of the past, certain things weighed it down, including slower paced introductory chapters, a little too much middled leading, and not much on the side of scares.<br /><br />The protagonist, Eddie, is a well written character with a hellacious life. I felt for him the whole time, and enjoyed being in his head - his personality held chemistry with mine. There weren't that many other characters involved, but the ones that were did their job. The book is a very solitary tale, told in a first person point of view, a form not used as often these days. I, however, love it when this POV is used, as long as it's done well. I felt a stronger bond with Eddie because of it, and the atmosphere came across as confusing (in a good way!), dramatic, and creepy.<br /><br />The ending of Black Fire stunned me; that alone made it worth the read. Although it's not flawless, it is a terrific debut, strong in plot and characterization, but a bit weak in pace.	2005-02-28
US	51735249	R1DVO4AC2KBAST	0843952571	738437981	Borrowed Flesh	Books	2	1	1	N	N	A dissapointing novel	My first gripe is that the back cover blurb does NOT accurately describe what the books really about. The murdering of young girls, as said on the blurb, is actually not the focal point of the story. This in itself isn't a sin, though, and I usually never hold this against a book. The authors don't write them anyway, marketing does.<br /><br />The plot is different in some ways, and I applaud the writer for this, but it just didn't hold any pizzazz. It was a bit formulaic, unexciting, and when the two 'baddies' came face to face, it was a weak battle without much spirit behind it.<br /><br />The book read like a light read, instead of anything deep, and I had trouble taking much of it seriously. The character of Vanessa was stale and cardboardish, Ashleys' didn't make sense - inconsistencies were made on the personalities of the characters involved just to suit the plot and keep it moving in a convenient direction. A good thing the author DID do with Vanessa was give her multiple personalities, making an interesting internal conflict to read about.<br /><br />The writing style is direct and to the point, although I felt some of the emphasis was overdone. For example, when Vanessa is always haunted by being alone, the point can be gotten and felt without it repeated every chapter. I give brownie points to the author for granting her characters with emotion, but it just didn&#8217;t seem leveled out to me.<br /><br />While this book holds many flaws, it did keep me reading. I didn't want to quit out of boredom, so it didn't fail on all levels. Not a book I would recommend to most.	2005-02-28

There's not much scaring going on, and almost everyone in the story gets along, except for the antagonist, who is mainly seen through toward the end. Sure, there are horrifying scenes, like with the sadistic, snake obsessed, drug dealer, but overall this one reads light and comical.<br /><br />The main characters are easily latched on to. They seem real and although they pity themselves a bit too much at times, their personalities are amusing and deep.<br /><br />The thing that wins this novel over from stale to something- you -cant -put -down- to- save- your- life is that there are surprises along the way that jarred me to the floor. Things about one of the protagonists I would have never imagined. Some of it was predictable, sure, but for the most part: complete disbelief.<br /><br />In the end, I wouldnt pay a lot of money for it, but it was still worth reading and, when read, kept my attention big time.	2004-12-19

The author expresses his opinions on plots and the many forms, how they all originate from a top three to be broken down into a 'top 20' for easier following. Chapter two, ' The Lowest Common Plot Denominators', discusses building tension through opposition, the three sections of a story (beginning, middle, and end), and other crucial things a plot requires to stay alive. Chapter 3, 'The Strong Force', is short in length, basically informing the reader what a 'character driven plot is' versus a 'plot driven' one.<br /><br />Chapter four, 'Deep Structure', focuses on themes and moral arguments, while chapter five, 'Triangles', is an interesting, unique way to see characters and how they interact with each other.<br /><br />After this, we finally begin the '20 plots', each divided by chapter. Each goes through all three 'acts' of the plot (again: beginning, middle, end), ending with a checklist to recap all that has been learned.<br /><br />The wrap up chapter, 'Parting Shots', reminds you that the book is not a guide etched in stone and that rules are made to be broken. It's also stated that many times a plot is a mixture of two or more basic '20 Master Plots'.<br /><br />At 232 pages, this book covers quite a bit. I was enthused as the sections, and recognized many of the 'patterns', but was left wanting in other areas. The information was useful, but if you read it straight through, many of the plot types repeat the same thing and it becomes redundant and dull. Also, some held examples of other novels and stories to illustrate what the author meant. I loved this; it enabled me to get a firmer grasp on things. Unfortunitely many of the plots don't have as many examples, or none at all, and I missed it when they did.<br /><br />Wrapping up, this is a great resource guide for writers. If you have trouble with plotting, pick this up for a reasonable price. Heck, even if you don't, still pick it up for there are things out there you may not know about yet. On the downside it wasn't the most interesting thing to read, was a bit redundant, other times not being consistent enough.hey did.  <br /> <br />Wrapping up, this is a great resource guide for writers.

Concentrating on the old religion, Santeria, and adding some modern day twists, it works on multiple levels. One thing that really worked for the novel was the characterization; lead detective Decker had me laughing aloud more than once. The gore and violence were not censored in the least; I cringed in more than one scene as a victim was offed in horrendous fashions. Masterton's writing style is exceptional, the pace begins with violence and ends with it, and there's a mystery in there to boot - one not easy to figure out.<br /><br />Give this one a try; I was glad I did.	2004-11-15

The villians are introduced way too fast, there's not enough mystery remaining, the characters aren't really latched on to, and the ending wasn't anything overly powerful. Still, All Hallow's Eve isn't too bad...it kept me reading, and that's saying something. If a novel is genuinely bad, I usually won't finish it. I finished this one, because it DID have some saving grace. One being the well written detective, another being morbid curiosity for the show down (although my expectations weren't that high), and another being that while the plot was disorganized and jumbled, it wasn't exactly dull.	2004-11-15

He lists some general things to trigger your thinking, like childhood, friends, stories you hear,  but that's as far as it goes.<br /><br />Setting is divided into many sections, all useful, very informative, alive with detail. If you had a problem with setting before, this is up your alley.<br /><br />The character section discusses round characters, their mannerisms, appearance, etc. It has useful comments but again is all general.<br /><br />Plot is a great chapter - he discusses character conflict plots, nonconfrontational plots, and combinations. He mentions a note card technique for generating plots but as before, it's more of an educational guide and not an inspirational one. I didn't find much useful advice for organizing or structuring a story.<br /><br />His point of view is loaded with stuff I've never seen before; I consider this one of the best chapters the book offers.<br /><br />The only problems I had was the guide was written in a sort of stuffy way at times. Also, many of the story examples used were not works I read, or have an interest in reading, more literary types work that you focus on in school. Because of this, it was a bit harder for me to get drawn into these sorts of examples.<br /><br />Overall, though, it's a great guide for writing itself, not necessarily novel writing or short stories alone.	2000-02-04
