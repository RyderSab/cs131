The sexually deviant content is told in sickingly detail, and I have to admit I couldn't read all 600 pages of it.	2005-08-19

Unfortunately, it reminds me of waking up a hibernating bear and jotting down his every yawn and gripe. A few moments of insight amid the tedium.	2005-08-19

Many factual errors, and Mr. Simon spends almost as much time coming up with excuses for why the Red Sox were the last team to integrate, as he does celebrating Jackie Robinson and those who spurred the re-integration of \\"Organized Baseball.\\" This dashed-off effort completely overlooks that Blacks WERE previously in Organized Baseball, but were booted out. <br />	2005-08-19

While this biography of a fine, mysterious player is adequate, Casway's assertion that  19th Century baseball was an \\"Emerald Age,\\" due to Irish dominance is ludicrous. Almost all the top ball players were of English ancestry at the time, which reflected the U.S. immigrant population.

In recent years, a number of wonderful books with original research have come out on McGraw and his era (such as Baseball's Radical for All Seasons, Hit Em Where They Ain't) but this book ignors them, and adds nothing new.
