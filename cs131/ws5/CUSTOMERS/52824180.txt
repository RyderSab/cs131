It's like the Scholastic mysteries you used to read after school, only this one is for adults.  It recreates the feel of a novel from the 19th century, and has evocative illustrations throughout.<br /><br />The book is the saga of a well-read \\"practical\\" (practicing) magician vs. the speculations of academic magicians (those who study but do not practice).  Later, the practicing magician takes on a brilliant but unstable apprentice who goes on to surpass his training, applying instinct and insight to resurrect heroic-age English magic.  Along the way, the master magician and his pupil must face the growing menace posed by an ancient fairy who was summoned by one of the master magician's earlier spells.<br /><br />Imagine C.S. Lewis and Ludwig Wittgenstein as magicians...<br /><br />The length may seem a bit daunting to some, but I found this to be a pleasurable fireside read for some cold autumn nights.  I will watch for Ms. Clarke's future works.	2005-09-29
US	52824180	RQOYBRM3ZTHU	0515117927	704778030	Arc Light	Books	4	6	7	N	Y	An Alternate Ending to the Cold War	This is an engaging account of an alternate ending to the Cold War.  WWIII is an accidental outcome of a chain of mistakes and reactions that are highly plausible in the modern spin-controlled politics of opinion polls and political/military decisions.  The story has a few things that don't seem realistic.  For example, as we now know, global instability causes energy prices to climb to crippling levels, and this was not foreseen in the book.  The book never explains why the North Koreans choose to suddenly attack South Korea, and also just as suddenly withdraw.  Also, why do the Chinese halt their attacks upon Russia and sit on their hands during the US-Russia conflict?  And M-16's with \\"recoil?\\"  However, if you look past little details like this, the book is a fascinating and informed depiction of how WWIII could plausibly unfold with today's modern hardware and force structures.  I'd always envisioned WWIII as one big MAD global mushroom cloud ending life on earth.  But this book shows that life can go on after nuclear war, which was the biggest surprise to me.<br /><br />The author eerily got it right in 1994 that the President (a Clinton-like character) would be impeached, and the date the nuclear war begins (6/11) reminded me of 9/11.<br /><br />Overall, a good suspensful page-turner.	2005-09-09

I relished envisioning the disguised localities in the book such as Canal Park, Glensheen Mansion, Grandma's Restaurant, Blackwoods Grill, Split Rock Lighthouse, Fitger's Restaurant,  Northern Lights Roadhouse, etc.  (at least those are the locations I envisioned as I read, whether intended or not.)  Also I happened to read this novel at the time of year in which the story takes place (late August/early September, on the verge of the North Shore leaf season), so it further helped me get into the atmosphere.<br /><br />The only downside is that characterizations seem to be a little light.  Nearly all the women in the story have sex on their minds and the men are various shades of jerk.  I didn't find anyone that I cared about very much.  Certain scenes and dialogue didn't ring true.  You can be certain that if there were four murders within the space of a week in the REAL Duluth, it would be buzzing with media, state BCA, etc. (as it was during the actual Congdon murders at Glensheen in the 1970's), not just an older retired detective benignly poking around.  Also, no police are going to stand for a long monologue by the murderer during a standoff with hostages.  And descriptions of behavior, such as Sidney's grotesque manners, are overemphasized to the point of becoming annoying.  Things like this seemed to give the story a flippant, unrealistic edge.  However, if you willingly suspend disbelief and just overlook such things, this is an enjoyable read.<br /><br />For another enjoyable mystery cosy set on the North Shore, I recommend UNRAVELED SLEEVE by Monica Ferris.	2005-08-25

While many people only think of him in association with the stories of Sherlock Holmes, in fact Conan Doyle (his compound last name) was a multi-faceted man who grew up in poverty, became a medical doctor, served on a whaling ship in the Arctic, and worked in an Army hospital during the Boer War.  He began his literary career writing stories for magazines, and one of these stories concerned a detective named Sherlock Holmes.  The Sherlock Holmes stories became popular, although Conan Doyle did not consider them serious literature and would come to consider the demand for this character as pulling him away from his efforts at more important works.<br /><br />Conan Doyle lost many close relatives during WWI.  Perhaps as a result of this he developed a deep interest in spiritualism, and this interest gradually began to absorb his life as he left off literary pursuits to advocate for spiritualist research via press and podium.  This advocacy led many to lose their esteem for the creator of Sherlock Holmes since they assumed that Conan Doyle and Sherlock must be one and the same in personality and temperament.<br /><br />I was interested to learn that Conan Doyle wrote his detective stories by determining the ending, and then working back toward it.  Thus his character's \\"brilliant observations\\" and deductions were always carefully planned by knowledge of the solution before it was apparent to the reader.  While Sherlock's powers of observation and deduction came to represent a paradigm of rational scientific proof, in reality they were an illusion working back from given solutions.  In the same way, Conan Doyle would advocate for spiritualism by pleading for people to restrain their skepticism, and believe in order to know.  Seen in this way, the contrast between his flinty-eyed detective and the real-life Conan Doyle's interest in spiritualism seems less dramatic.<br /><br />Overall, this book read like a novel and was a good balance between Conan Doyle's whole life story and the part of it that involved Sherlock Holmes.good balance between Conan Doyle's whole life story and the part of it that involved Sherlock Holmes.	2005-08-24

This is the beginning of a mystery series with an undertaker as the main character.

Along the way he meets all sorts of unsavory characters and finds out that the deceased was involved in dealings with the mob.<br /><br />The story is fast-paced and well written, but the main character is a little hard to believe as a funeral director - he has a volatile temper, is a former alcoholic, and deals with many personal demons.

During his student days at Oxford, Tolkien forms a club called the \\"Tea Club and Barrovian Society\\" (TCBS) with three friends.  They meet for discussion and fellowship regarding poetry, literature, and other subjects.  As WWI casts its shadow across Britain, the members of the TCBS are drawn up into the military:  one to the navy, and the other three (including Tolkien) into the army.  They attempt to maintain the fellowship of the TCBS through correspondence and meetings, exchanging and critiquing each others' writings and encouraging each other to hold on to their ideals during the trials of war.  Then one of the TCBS is killed during battle on the Somme, and the remaining members struggle to define whether the fellowship of the TCBS is irreparably shattered.  Then another is killed, leaving only Tolkien in the army and Christopher Wiseman in the navy.  Tolkien develops trench fever and spends the rest of the war convalescing back in Britain.<br /><br />Although the first part of the book moves slowly, the story is engaging and moving.  Tolkien's mythology and literary prototypes were clearly taking root during this time, beginning themes that would come to fruition in his later, more famous writings.  The author convincingly presents how those themes were influenced and shaped by Tolkien's experience of war and the loss of his close friends, as Tolkien feels compelled to be faithful to the legacy of the TCBS and \\"carry on\\" in their memory.  One wonders what the lost friends would have gone on to write, had they lived.  One wonders whether Tolkien's life and writings would be different, had his friends lived, or had WWI never happened.	2005-08-11

The first section is a vague, rambling account of various \\"business dealings\\" that Nick has with an assortment of people.  The only relevance it has to the rest of the book is that it hints at a backstory that Nick has written some sort of \\"manuscript\\" that he is trying to get published.  He and others around him are allegedly being contacted by \\"angels\\" who encourage him to get the manuscript published.  However, this does not happen, despite the angels' predictions and efforts on his behalf.<br /><br />In the second half of the book, Nick then undergoes past-life regression by Julia Ingram.  This half of the book contains narratives in which Nick vaguely describes his past life as the Apostle Paul.  Evidently the whole New Testament is inaccurate and humanity has lived and died in error for two thousand years, since nearly every detail of the Gospels is presented as having been distorted by Jesus' disciples, out to make a buck.  (Which doesn't explain why they went to their deaths for their witness.)  To list the discrepancies between this information and the New Testament would take a long time.  Read the Gospel of Luke and the Book of Acts for an accurate account of the events described.<br /><br />Either this book is false or the New Testament is.  The reader will have to decide.  In the words of the REAL Apostle Paul:  \\"Let God's curse fall on anyone, including myself, who preaches any other message than the one we told you about.  Even if an angel comes from heaven and preaches any other message, let him be forever cursed.  I will say it again:  If anyone preaches any other gospel than the one you welcomed, let God's curse fall upon that person.\\"  (Galatians 1:8-9)<br /><br />Sounds like the Real Apostle Paul knew that pretenders such as this would arise, trying to peddle newsletters and seminars.	2005-08-09

Beginning with Benjamin Franklin and William Willett, various arguments are advanced for the idea of moving the clock forward in the summertime in order to cause society to be more active during morning daylight, in order to reduce the need for artificial lighting.  This practice is haphazardly observed by various countries until WWI and WWII illustrate the practical utility of the idea.  In the US, daylight saving time (DST) is haphazardly implemented, until legislation eventually standardizes the observance in the 1960's.<br /><br />The reason that I give a \\"grudging\\" five stars is that I still personally disagree with DST.  Biological circadian rythms do not easily go backward, and I believe that one day research will describe the deleterious effects (sleepy drivers, morning heart attacks, reduced productivity in schools and workplaces, etc.) that can be directly traced to disrupted biological rythms that take weeks or months to recover from the artificially disrupted schedule.  These effects, when fully identified, may more than fully counteract any marginal beneficial economic advantage from energy conservation.  If DST is such a good idea let's move the time zones one hour forward and then leave them there rather than shift back and forth twice a year.  This book does not even address the issue of circadiam rhythyms, except for a one-sentence mention on the second to last page.  A full evaluation of DST must include this important factor, as anyone who drags out of bed for weeks after \\"spring forward\\" day, sipping cup after cup of coffee just to awaken, can personally attest.	2005-08-04

After reading about halfway through, I set it aside for other things, always intending to get back to it someday.  In 2005, during an extended convalescence, I started over and read it through.  Back in 1997, why did I stop?  I realize now that it was because the book is not what I thought it was when I bought it.<br /><br />When I first bought the book I thought it was going to be a topic-by-topic scientific refutation of New Age pseudoscience, arguing on the merits.  But instead Sagan discusses example after example of the most self-evidently absurd tabloid examples of alien abductions, psychic con men, etc., while linking these absurdities to the concept of organized religion.<br /><br />Here is an example of Sagan's thesis, in his own words:  \\"...if the alien abduction accounts are mainly about brain physiology, hallucinations, distorted memories of childhood, and hoaxing, don't we have before us a matter of supreme importance...touching upon...perhaps even the origins of our religions?\\"<br /><br />Another:  \\"...in an age when traditional religions have been under withering fire by science...\\"<br /><br />Another:  \\"...in the 1960's I argued that UFO stories were crafted chiefly to satisfy religious longings...an alternative is proferred to the God hypothesis.\\"<br /><br />Another:  \\"...at a time when science has complicated critical adherence to the old-time religions...\\"<br /><br />If Sagan wanted to assert that religious thought is an obsolete cultural and neurological artifact of our evolution, he should have plainly said so, instead of dancing around it like this.  It would have made for a much more interesting and focused book.<br /><br />I believe that Sagan falsely portrays religion/science as an \\"either/or\\" dichotomy.  There are scientists who know that science cannot explain everything, and there are religious people who know that science is based on evidence and faith is based on what is unseen/unquantifiable.  Neither should make unwarranted claims regarding the province of the other.<br /><br />There are those who, disillusioned with religion as they perceive it, would like to put their \\"faith\\" in science, which would be a contradiction.<br /><br />Science has no answers for what happens to our consciousness after death.  People find no comfort or meaning in science's admission:  \\"I don't know - I think you simply cease to exist.\\"  At least religion gives them some answer, and if it was the wrong one - upon death, there is no difference in their outcome.<br /><br />In his book NONZERO, author Robert Wright discusses the concept of \\"memes,\\" which are mental constructs (ideas, fads, theories, technology, intellectual disciplines, images, etc.) that move through societies.  He suggests that memes are subject to the principle of Darwinian \\"survival of the fittest\\" just as with biological specimens.  With this in view, why does religion as a mental construct continue to grow and prosper, even with so many developments in human technology and knowledge?  It must still somehow have some fitness for existence in the mental realm.  It must provide something that science does not or cannot.<br /><br />Sagan's implication is that ignorance is due to pseudoscience and religion.  But the truth is that much ignorance is also due to being awash in information, and no one has the time, training, knowledge or ambition to filter out the wheat from the chaff.  (See Barry Schwartz' THE PARADOX OF CHOICE.)  So instead we operate upon rumor, popularity, or what seems simplest.  Much of the information we encounter is \\"spun\\" by commercial and political marketing and promotion.  (Presentations with an agenda.)  Pure information, which is not as attractively packaged/presented, is overlooked or neglected.  It takes hard work to turn data into knowledge.  And many erroneous beliefs are based on a pyramid of  aggregated false information.<br /><br />Sagan characterizes organized religion as thinking it has all the answers.  This is as much a stereotype as to characterize science as having all the answers.  Science is a spectrum of knowledge, from the absolute certainty of mathematics to the probabilities of the physical sciences, to the social sciences where less and less is quantifiable because we spend more time just trying to identify the relevant variables.  At the far end of this spectrum is religion, the realm of things we believe on faith because we cannot prove them.  At this end, we take things \\"on faith,\\" consciously aware that we do so, because they regard things that are currently unquantifiable and unperceivable.<br /><br />A frequent theme in this and other of Sagan's writings is how insignificant \\"our small world\\" and concerns are, in comparison to the vast infinity of the universe.  This is analogous to saying how insignificant your or my petty life is in the overall scheme of the world.  Yet it is of great significance to me personally.  And if I am so insignificant, if \\"our small world\\" is so insignificant, what does it matter to the world or to the universe what I believe?  I believe it is an inherent quality of sentient consciousness to search for significance, and if I only find more and more how insignificant I am, I may as well go out and commit suicide - such is the empty comfort of this starkly materialist perspective.<br /><br />Science is a tool to be used toward various ends.  But it cannot tell us what is right and wrong.  The one who looks to science for moral guidance has only a relative gauge of apparent self-advantage and endless redefinition.<br /><br />We seem to have an innate tendency to ascribe sentience to the unknown.  The sound in the dark is a \\"who\\" not a \\"what.\\"  Perhaps science is the method which, by increasing reductionism, quantification, and mathematical statistics, we remove the myth of sentience from the world.  After all, if the world has no higher intelligence or purpose, if all is various states of matter and energy, then we humans are only animate matter also, our will and wishes merely illusions requiring greater definition, measurement, and statistical bell curves to be digitized.<br /><br />Sagan asserts that the Book of Deuteronomy is a hoax by King Josiah \\"in the midst of a major reformation struggle.\\"  This is a major assertion - could he provide at least one reference?  If it is his speculation, or someone else's, he should plainly say so.  Else, by his lights, we could assert that all archaelogical discoveries are, more likely than not, hoaxes fabricated by the discoverer.<br /><br />All science proceeds from foundational axioms.  Without the acceptance of some beliefs (i.e., the world is rational, quantifiable, generalizable, etc.) science cannot begin.  Once it has begun, the foundational beliefs tend to color or influence all data and conclusions derived thereby (such as, the physical universe is all there is.)  It requires as much \\"religious\\" (belief without evidence) faith to NOT believe in something, as it does to believe IN something else.<br /><br />Morality and law must have a foundation also.  If we cannot find the foundation in religious tenets, we may instead find it in economic advantage for the majority, or whatever belief system we agree upon.  If we cannot agree upon a common belief system, the foundation will rest in the chaos of individual advantage and actualization.  Sagan says:  \\"Today...the price of moral ambiguity is now too high.\\"  Is science to give us our moral certainty?  What axioms will it use to do that?<br /><br />This book decries the American public's scientific illiteracy.  But scientific illiteracy stems not from the influence of religious thought.  Rather, it is an artifact of a culture of skepticism, encouraged by scientific advances, in which fundamental values and morality are no longer held in agreement, but are a matter of individual preference.  We are all now our own information-filter.  And in a culture awash with choicesand information, it is easiest to default to what is popular, easy, or attractive.  Our ideal has become mere self-actualization.

Sagan asserts that the Book of Deuteronomy is a hoax by King Josiah \\"in the midst of a major reformation struggle.\\"  This is a major assertion - could he provide at least one reference?  If it is his speculation, or someone else's, he should plainly say so.  Else, by his lights, we could assert that all archaelogical discoveries are, more likely than not, hoaxes fabricated by the discoverer.    All science proceeds from foundational axioms.  Without the acceptance of some beliefs (i.e., the world is rational, quantifiable, generalizable, etc.) science cannot begin.  Once it has begun, the foundational beliefs tend to color or influence all data and conclusions derived thereby (such as, the physical universe is all there is.)  It requires as much \\"religious\\" (belief without evidence) faith to NOT believe in something, as it does to believe IN something else.    Morality and law must have a foundation also.  If we cannot find the foundation in religious tenets, we may instead find it in economic advantage for the majority, or whatever belief system we agree upon.  If we cannot agree upon a common belief system, the foundation will rest in the chaos of individual advantage and actualization.  Sagan says:  \\"Today...the price of moral ambiguity is now too high.\\"  Is science to give us our moral certainty?  What axioms will it use to do that?    This book decries the American public's scientific illiteracy.  But scientific illiteracy stems not from the influence of religious thought.  Rather, it is an artifact of a culture of skepticism, encouraged by scientific advances, in which fundamental values and morality are no longer held in agreement, but are a matter of individual preference.  We are all now our own information-filter.  And in a culture awash with choices and information, it is easiest to default to what is popular, easy, or attractive.  Our ideal has become mere self-actualization.  And so schools produce a generation of imperious, well-entertained young princelings, who cannot be bothered to \\"bore\\" themselves with things that require arduous, patient, persistent effort, and which are uncertain of immediate reward or gratification.

US	52824180	R3HKTUBQUND7LX	0446607177	11618814	Riptide	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Solving the mystery of Oak Island	This is a novel that is based on the real-life unsolved mystery of Oak Island's Money Pit.  I thought the book had a realistic account of what it would take to penetrate the mystery of the Money Pit.  The story was entertaining and kept me turning pages.  The only negative comment I would make is that Neidelman, the treasure salvor, apparently has never heard of OSHA or workplace safety concepts, and this made him less credible as a character.  (I often found myself wondering how the ESS from ICE LIMIT would have handled this task.) Overall, though, this was a very engaging read and a great way to pass an afternoon.	2005-07-26

Though there was a large cast of characters, I felt that they all were developed and had believable interactions.  I am interested in ancient Indian culture, and it was fun to read about a possible lost city of the Anasazi since they are so mysterious and little is known about them.  The pictographs adorning each chapter also seemed to add a little bit of spookiness to the narrative.

In WWI he served as an officer in the artillery, and developed an interest in physics and science.  He trained as a lawyer and went into finance, multiplying his fortune.  Then he decided to pull away from the world of business and devote himself to science, hiring a Professor Wood to teach him and help him develop a state of the art laboratory at Tuxedo Park, a mansion in an exclusive district.  Loomis invited scientists from around the world to come to Tuxedo Park and do their research using his resources.  He used his business and political connections (his cousin was Henry Stimson, Secretary of War under FDR,) to network and bring together great minds of many countries, collaborating with Britain to develop and refine radar technology to resist the Nazis by aiding aircraft interception and submarine hunting.  Before and during the US entry into WWII, the research effort begun by Loomis and his associates was a major element in assisting the Allies to win WWII.  Meanwhile, other scientists working alongside some of Loomis' associates, developed the atomic bomb.  \\"Radar won the war, but the atom bomb ended it.\\"<br /><br />Along the way Loomis became a first-rate scientist himself and was involved in many patents.  But his greatest contribution was in his fostering of the conditions which allowed creative collaboration and breakthroughs of some of the finest scientists of his time.  The US was fortunate that he did so.  He did use some coercive methods to forge these networks, in ways that would not be allowed today in the world of business and government.  One wonders what such a man as Loomis might accomplish today, a wealthy man with scientific knowledge and a desire to work for the advancement and betterment of humanity.<br /><br />The book also gives some glimpses into the social strata of the moneyed class, in the early days of the 20th century.  These doors are rarely opened so far to the scrutinizing public.public.	2005-07-14

In the beginning of the first half, Venus explodes into a cloud of gas.  However, this is merely coincidental and has nothing directly to do with the rest of the plot (except to foreshadow what may happen to Earth.) The scientists begin examining this problem and eventually figure out that a substance (which eventually gets called \\"moonseed\\") was brought back to Earth along with geologic samples from the Moon by Apollo in the 1960's and 70's.  When this material comes in contact with terran soil it begins a transformation which will eventually cause the Earth to turn to lava and explode.  (It affected Venus because some of the material reached there when we sent our unmanned probes.)<br /><br />The scientist who figures this out (or rather theorizes it) ends up getting onto a mission to the Moon to try and figure out how to stop the process.  (Because the Moon is full of this stuff and yet doesn't explode.)  This begins the second novel within the book, in which the Earth is left behind and is largely forgotten.  This part goes into great detail about training to be an astronaut, getting launched, space travel, and landing on and exploring the Moon.  I enjoyed the detail of this part, it made me feel like I really have an idea what it would be like to stand on the Moon, see the Apollo landing site, drive the lunar rover, etc.  If you are a space buff or wannabe astronaut, this section will really be enjoyable, it gives you a great experience of \\"being there.\\"<br /><br />The ending is kind of an afterthought and is heavily summarized, I found it disappointing and sad.  As a story overall, this novel is somewhat disjointed, except to show how all our global preoccupations and petty lives are insignificant in contrast to the vast impersonal infinity of space.  For me, the experience of landing on the Moon was what made this book a worthwhile read.	2005-07-14

I felt that he did an adequate job of this.  In addition, Dr. Florida describes how the US has historically been a magnet for the intellectual talent of other countries, but now the post-9/11 security climate is beginning to dampen this immigration, causing a \\"brain drain\\" where the US is losing out on the cream of the intellectual crop as the world's best and brightest no longer seek education and opportunity in the US but increasingly find it in their home countries instead.  (One wonders, for example, how history would be different had Einstein or other \\"German rocket scientists\\" stayed in Germany.)  In addition, US talent also is finding greener pastures overseas.<br /><br />As Dr. Florida points out, it would not be beneficial for any one person (or government) to try and lay out a complete agenda for how society would best respond to this situation.  (Although he does give a general road map.) It is for the individual localities to develop solutions based on regional trends, strengths and resources.<br /><br />I offer two observations that Dr. Florida might consider within his thesis.  First, his geographical emphasis may become obsolete in light of the increasing capacity of online technology to allow creative class individuals to participate in work and leisure regardless of where they are located.  Second, it occurs to me that one unaddressed area is the \\"dark side of the creative class,\\" (terrorists, sex predators, stalkers, serial killers, drug dealers, gang members, corporate scofflaws, con men, hackers, identity thieves, etc.) who apply their creativity and technological capability in ways that harm others.  It is the task of society to deal with this segment of the creative class, which geographically accumulates in the penal system.	2005-07-11

The author creates an engaging narrative of characters and things that may or may not have happened on the voyage, based on log information and what is known about the trip.  Interspersed are chapters with general background material on the ships, history, and difficulties of the time.<br /><br />I found this a very engaging read, and when I had finished it I was wishing for more.  The life of a seaman in those days was truly harsh, a life of constant misery and hardship.  The men live on short rations, long hours, little or no sleep, constant cold and damp, battling storm after storm, climbing up in the masts 160 feet above the rolling deck to deal with canvas sails weighing hundreds of pounds.  Some men get their fingernails pulled out, some fall to their deaths in the sea, never to be seen again, and some live on to see the next port and another voyage.<br /><br />If you are interested in sailing ships and stories of the sea, you will like this book.	2005-06-10

As such, it seems to be a bit rambling, each chapter seems like a separate statement rather than a chronological chapter of a book.  Ms. Whitman also seems careful not to ruffle too many feathers, I think there are things she could have spoken about more directly and in greater detail (for example she doesn't detail exactly why/how she left the EPA).  I did enjoy the personal insights into various aspects of Republican history, and I too feel a nostalgia for the more statesmanlike and progressive \\"Grand Old Party\\" of olden days.  Hopefully Ms. Whitman's views will receive serious consideration among the decision-makers of the Republican Party.<br /><br />I do wonder slightly whether this book is Ms. Whitman's toe-tipping for a possible national political run in 2008... or at least an effort to be a contender?	2005-06-07

Christians are not able to blindly accept the platform of one party or another, but should rather work for God's will in all areas.  I don't necessarily agree with all Mr. Wallis' interpretations of God's will regarding political issues, but he's asking good questions of the modern-day Pharisees.  Jesus would likely admonish both sides of the political aisle today.<br /><br />As I was reading this book, I had a mental image of Jesus standing behind the blue Presidential podium, giving a press conference...WWJD? indeed.	2005-06-07

In many places it reads like a transcript of stream-of-thought interviews, and many things seem only barely relevant - such as pages-long digressions on the careers of friends and relatives.  I'm left with the impression that De Kelley was sort of a shallow person, a personable, mellow guy, drinking and smoking life away between parts.  They're often scraping on the edge of poverty but always have enough cash for \\"partying.\\"<br /><br />It was interesting to learn of Kelley's many brushes with big stars during his movie years.  And we do find out about his Army career, some behind the scenes stories of the \\"Trek\\" years, and the story behind his pinky ring.  But after reading this book it appears there wasn't a lot to the interior life of De Kelley other than relaxing with his wife, smoking and drinking, and watching the grass grow in his back yard.  The \\"Dr. McCoy\\" who inspired generations to enter the medical profession was in reality a heavy smoker who died by inches from cancer in the hospital.<br /><br />This book really needs some editing to make it more readable.

Keegan writes a good capsule summary of the history of Iraq in the 20th century, leading up to Saddam's rise to power.  This is the best part of the book.  Once the \\"Second Iraq War\\" begins, things revert to present-tense and the narrative becomes much more superficial, with a lot of rah-rah about the skill and accomplishments of the US and British military forces.  While the military operations are indeed admirable for their intrepid skill, the more compelling interest regarding the Iraq War is WHY?  Keegan glosses over this question, merely noting that in the wake of 9/11, \\"certain neoconservatives\\" in the US Administration developed the idea that Saddam was an imminent threat, with \\"no doubt\\" that Saddam had WMD's.  Keegan describes in greater detail the struggles of Tony Blair to \\"sell\\" the war to British politicians, while giving no examination to the center of the issue, which is why the \\"war fever\\" grew within the ranks of the US leaders.  Once the decision to go to war was made, there could be little doubt that the superior military forces would prevail.  When formal hostilities are concluded, however, it is of less certainty whether the superior military can prevail in \\"winning the peace.\\"<br /><br />An appendix describes the author's interview with Gen. Tommy Franks.  At the end of the appendix, Keegan lists a series of additional questions he could have asked, but which are unanswered.  I think he should have endeavored to obtain those answers before writing this book, which seems like something that was hurriedly written and rushed to print in order to meet a market deadline.  As a historian, Keegan should know that a more deliberative study is required for full understanding of complex historical events.<br /><br />This book foreshadows an emerging world sociopolitical struggle between \\"Olympians\\" (as Keegan describes them) such as the European Union, who eschew all armed intervention for the sake of endless international litigation and sanctioning, and those such as the present US Administration who believe in old-fashioned national soveriegnity, gunboat diplomacy, and preemptive war.  In the increasingly interdependent global marketplace, it will be interesting to watch the ongoing resolution of these conflicting visions of overall world governance.

Goldberg presents complex information in an easy to understand way.  His thesis is that early in life, our brains have a greater ability to analyze and assimilate new information, developing neural \\"patterns.\\"  As we age, our analytical ability degrades due to physical aging of the brain, but we continue to thrive because the many \\"patterns\\" accreted over our lifetime help us to quickly recognize new data and categorize it.  The adult brain's extensively-developed repertoire of patterns/data funnels is an analogy for \\"wisdom\\" which intuitively reaches insightful conclusions without much analysis.<br /><br />As a result, Goldberg suggests that if we consciously cultivate our mental activity, building up neural connections and \\"patterns,\\" we will insulate ourselves against any potential cognitive erosion due to aging.  In the final chapters, Goldberg goes on to describe his facility that provides computer-mediated mental \\"workouts\\" to those who desire such therapy.  I felt that this part of the book was a bit of a tease, or advertisement.  Goldberg doesn't tell us what mental exercises to undertake, the implication is that we need to seek the services of his facility, or devise our own mental exercise program.  I found this part a bit disappointing.  (For those seeking such practical advice/exercises for brain development I recommend \\"Mozart's Brain and the Fighter Pilot\\" by Richard Restak.)	2005-04-25

As such, it is a bit rambling.  There are two chapters about her early life as a slave, but the author knows that what is most interesting to the readers is her life in the white house, and so she skips ahead to that period, giving us her personal \\"insider account\\" of daily vignettes with Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln.  These vignettes include an eyewitness account of Lincoln's second inauguration address, the death of Willie Lincoln, and events immediately after Lincoln's assasination.  The author then goes on to describe her post-white house associations with Mrs. Lincoln, who became a personal friend, as Mrs. Lincoln deals with post-presidency debts.  The book continues with an in-depth account of how Mrs. Keckley assisted Mrs. Lincoln with attempting to sell her personal effects (dresses) to raise money.  This must have been of great interest to readers when the book was first published in the 1860's, but has limited appeal to modern readers.<br /><br />Overall, however, the book is a very interesting glimpse into the daily life of a slave, an independent businesswoman in the 1860's, of someone who worked in the white house during the civil war, and of someone in the close confidence of the Lincolns.  It is well-written and engaging.	2005-04-25

Schroeder presents an interesting approach that works within the framework of both paradigms.<br /><br />Schroeder analyzes the original Hebrew wording of the Genesis account to identify subtle meanings which lend insight into how the Genesis account may be compatible with modern scientific knowledge.  He applies Einstein's concepts of relativity of time and space and suggests that the \\"six days\\" of creation may refer to a sort of cosmological time instead of 24-hour-day earth time, because in the big bang mass and gravity were concentrated (and gravity bends light and therefore dilates time).  Lending support is his observation that there were four \\"days\\" in the Genesis account that occurred before the sun (the basis for our 24-hour solar day) was created.  Schroeder suggests that these four pre-solar days may have encapsulated the periods of stellar expansion and evolution occurring after the big bang and before the ignition of our sun.  Schroeder also goes on to suggest that proto-humans such as the Neanderthal, etc. were part of the physical process of creation, after which \\"Adam\\" developed and became a \\"living soul.\\"  After the creation of Adam on the sixth day, according to Schroeder, the Bible begins marking time according to 24-hour solar days.<br /><br />I am not an expert in these areas but I feel that Schroeder presents some very interesting perspectives on this topic that provide a fertile ground for further pondering and investigation.  I would even suggest that Schroeder's work has the potential to do for creationism what Carl Sagan's \\"COSMOS\\" series did for the public understanding of cosmology.	2005-04-11

It was interesting to realize how little about severe weather was known early in the 20th century, and how the pioneers of meteorological research began their investigations to establish the information we now take for granted during everyday weather newscasts.<br /><br />The book covers technical meteorological information and concepts and so some parts could be challenging for someone who is not familiar with the science of meteorology.  For an easy and engaging primer, I'd recommend the \\"Golden Guide\\" book \\"Weather\\" by  Paul E. Lehr.<br /><br />If you are really fascinated by storms and storm chasing, I also recommend checking out your local \\"Skywarn\\" organization (just search \\"skywarn\\" in an internet search engine.)  These groups train people to be storm spotters and assist public safety officials to give tornado/severe weather warnings.  Even if you aren't interested in being a spotter, attending the free annual spring training class is very interesting because you see lots of actual footage of severe weather, talk to real spotters, and learn lots of practical info about the behavior of storms.	2005-04-06

However, the characters seem a bit unrealistic - everyone spends their time on trifles like editing a philosophy journal or playing in the Really Terrible Orchestra, where they can afford to give the audience salmon sandwiches and wine after the performance.  I was wondering how everyone makes a living, then discovered that Isabel is independently wealthy.  (Convenient.) The issue of Cat's getting back together with her old beau is complicated by the fact that Isabel is attracted to him also - this is not resolved and probably is intended to stretch on throughout more books.  The ending is disappointing and reveals the entire story as much ado about nothing.  My favorite character was Grace - if only she had been the lead character, with her commonsense perspective, the story would probably have been over in one or two chapters.<br /><br />Still, I did find it an entertaining way to pass an afternoon.  I just was waiting for the setup to end and the story to begin.  It never really did.	2005-04-04

It is interesting to read how an outsider would go about getting into this very secretive world.  Her experiences are not representative of all Amish - as she says in the book, there are many variations of belief and practice among Amish all across the country.  I was surprised to hear about Amish using a telephone, motorized pumps, polyester clothing, running shoes, and plastic, or using store-bought white bread and cereal that is laced with supplements.<br /><br />The author did not have this experience to become Amish and she returns to her normal life, but with some appreciation for simplicity in the modern world.  For those who find resonance in such a concept, I recommend reading Barry Schwartz's THE PARADOX OF CHOICE:  WHEN MORE IS LESS, for expanded development of that idea.	2005-04-04

The basic chronology of events are told with little expanded detail to lend interest.  Unless you are deeply interested in the details of Japan's historical political intrigues, or a compulsive book-finisher like me, this will be a slow read.  A bewildering array of names, dates, and events make it hard to keep track of who, what, and why.  The opening of the first chapter is the most engaging - read it again after you've finished the book.  I think Saigo's story has the elements of being quite an epic - evidently he is quite revered in Japan.  Perhaps another book will help to flesh out the story and tell it in a more engaging way.	2005-04-02

Even though I am a Christian and have accepted Christ, thinking about dying seemed sort of like waiting in a dentist's lobby before having a painful tooth drilling, and I was frequently haunted by anxiety and worry about what dying will be like.<br /><br />Reading this book was very helpful to me.  The author, a well-known Christian evangelist, receives a terminal diagnosis and this book is his story as he faces his own death.  He is genuine and open, taking you along through the thoughts and things he faces, and how he comes to grips with the knowledge.  The book goes from his first diagnosis, through his progressive failing health, and his final chapter, written in his last days, where he says goodbye to the reader.  An epilogue written by his wife describes his final hours as he passed away, which helps the reader to see the end of the journey being completed as he goes to be with Jesus.<br /><br />We will all face death, and will all have to go through this experience.  Even if we are Christians, the prospect of death disturbs us.  This book is a great help and a comfort to anyone who has lost someone, or who is facing their own death.	2005-03-31

However, I felt that the author devoted too many pages to detailed speculation and hypotheses and not enough to actual case studies.  (Which I found most interesting.)  The book gave me an interesting personal experience with core consciousness:  I frequently caught myself skimming the pages, realizing that I hadn't absorbed the text into my extended consciousness.<br /><br />An implication of this book is that consciousness (sentience) is simply a byproduct of the biological processing of our brain cells.  People in a coma or with severe brain damage literally have no consciousness, just as a light bulb with no electricity is dark.  This provides an interesting perspective on what it means to be \\"human.\\"  How are those with no consciousness to be differentiated from animals or any other collection of cells?  Justifications for euthanasia aside, it occurred to me that by this categorization it would one day be possible to characterize highly-developed sentient machines as \\"conscious,\\" with the attendant rights, etc. of humans.<br /><br />The author states that it is impossible for one person to share the experience of another person's consciousness.  I did not find that conclusion supported by the book.  If consciousness is truly a mechanistic emergent property of brain biology, then it would seem that, with the right technology, we will someday be able to display someone's mental images on a video screen, or do a technological version of the Vulcan \\"mind meld\\" (although that might cause a new hybrid consciousness rather than one consciousness experiencing another.)<br /><br />There were some very interesting ideas in this book.  I especially liked the concept of consciousness as a multi-layered phenomenon with different operating levels, like the various bars in a musical score.  (Mental difficulties can be thought of as a dischordance in one or more bars.)  Ground-breaking neurobiology must a very difficult topic to explain to the general reader, and I credit Damasio for this effort.  One will learn a great deal by reading this book, but it raises more questions than answers.  For a more engaging coverage of the same topic, I suggest V.S.

Robert Scott of the South Pole, at the climax of the Heroic Age of Antarctic exploration.  In the harshest conditions on earth, he and his fellow explorers faced the grim reality that they were doomed, fated to die one by one.<br /><br />\\"IceBound\\" is an account of modern heroes living in the very spot where Capt. Scott spoke those bleak words.  It is a triumph of ingenuity, resourcefulness, endurance, courage and technology that today people not only survive at the Pole but live, work, and prosper.<br /><br />I have read such classics as \\"Endurance\\" and \\"The Worst Journey in the World\\" that tell of the days of Shackleton, Amundsen, and Scott.  This book takes its place along with such classics, giving us a rare inside look at life on \\"The Ice\\" today, wintering over at the Pole.  I was surprised to learn that it is so cold in their quarters, and that the crew suffer from effects of altitude sickness, low blood oxygen, and hypothermia (I assumed that the South Pole Station would be fully climate-controlled.)  It was revealing to learn that the crew face continuous equipment failures and see all the strange side effects of such extreme cold (band aids not sticking, fuel turned to gelatin, dust-like frost on interior surfaces, etc.)<br /><br />Dr. Nielsen brings us along as she decides to go to The Ice, and all the things going on in her life which were part of that decision.  We get to experience the day-by-day tension and fear as she discovers a lump in her breast and realizes that it is growing.  Emails between her and her doctors and family make it seem as though these events are happening in \\"real time\\" as we read.  Through her words, we experience the special camraderie of the \\"Polies\\" as they pull together in so many ways to assist with her diagnosis, treatment, and emotional support.  Her extraction flight by the military is a miracle that Capt. Scott could never have imagined.  The \\"awful place\\" has been tamed a little in 90 years, but it is still \\"The Ice.\\"<br /><br />Hopefully other \\"Polies\\" (and those at other stations such as Vostok, etc.) will someday chronicle their experiences at the bottom of the world for the rest of us back in civilization who will never get to go.but it is still \\"The Ice.\\"    Hopefully other \\"Polies\\" (and those at other stations such as Vostok, etc.) will someday chronicle their experiences at the bottom of the world for the rest of us back in civilization who will never get to go.	2005-03-03

This book, however, describes an overall \\"reformation\\" movement (1400-1700 AD/CE) taking place before, during and after Luther.  Luther is the catalyst giving things sharper focus, however many political, cultural and religious factors beyond Luther were also in play.  This book chronicles, in great detail, these religious developments and struggles within both Protestant and Catholic factions throughout Europe, and how they interacted with and shaped each other.  The book also examines these currents as they spill over into North and South America, with continuing effects to the present day.<br /><br />This book is very detailed and comprehensive but is a bit \\"dry\\" reading for the non-academic reader.  Since it covers such an extensive body of material, it also gives cursory treatment to the things discussed.  (I personally felt that more extensive discussion of Luther and his writings would be appropriate.)  However, the book is useful to gain an overview of the significant names, places, and events of the entire reformation period, from which one can then seek other more in-depth material.	2005-02-28

The author spends a week at the Plaza Hotel, visiting with various staff and guests.  We get vignettes of the entire operation, from the doorman and front desk to the laundry, kitchen, concierge, security, bellhops, housekeeping staff, management, etc.  The book is a running interview, the author records whatever was happening at the moment, while talking to the various staff.  It also includes a bit of the history of the hotel.  The week culminates with the visit of the King and Queen of Sweden.<br /><br />One impression is that a great deal goes on behind the scenes of such apparent effortless luxury, especially dealing with the slovenliness or disorderly behavior of various guests.  The reader will gain an appreciation for those who provide hospitality during future stays.<br /><br />The only drawback to this book is that it is now a bit dated (1989), and as such is now more a work of history rather than a depiction of the current facility.  One wonders what a modern reprise might include, with new wrinkles resulting from today's business travelers and their computers, cell phones, and post-9/11 security needs, modern concern with communicable disease, information security, etc...	2005-02-24

While it is nice to read a novel that integrates aspects of the modern online world, I was overall not impressed.  I think that Gibson has written a satire about society's obsession with triviality.<br /><br />Cayce, the heroine, has some sort of psychic sense that allows her to proclaim within moments whether a given trademark or logo will \\"work\\" or not (as though the trademark of a product is the primary selling point of anything).  She gets paid megabucks to jet around the world and give five-minute consultations for rich corporate heads because she's such an accurate precursor of success or failure.  Indeed, she's so attuned to trademarks that she obliterates them from all her clothing and personal possessions, although she continues to \\"notice\\" every trademark in her field of view (except, mercifully is immune to trademarks in foriegn lands, which she cannot read.)  When she encounters a \\"bad\\" trademark, she is affected so viscerally that she becomes ill and obsessive, and must recite an odd mantra (\\"he took a duck in the face at 250 knots...\\") to clear her head.  In her spare time, she and numerous other bloggers across the world are obsessed with the unfolding online revelations of short video clips showing a man and a woman, and spend endless time speculating on who is producing them, why, and whether the video clips represent a finished work or whether it is a work in progress.  They debate heatedly about various nuances of the videos and what they could mean, dividing themselves into various fervent factions remininscient of early religious sects.  Fortunately for Cayce, the billionaire CEO who hired her for her 5-minute logo consultation is also willing to hire her (with an unlimited expense account) to track down the creator of these mysterious video clips, on the basis of a faint notion that something that can create so much \\"buzz\\" might be a new incipient marketing mechanism.  Along the way, Cayce is hunted by various mysterious individuals who are not who they seem, and she can trust no one.<br /><br />Personally I was amused by Gibson's using this format to pontificate upon which logos and brands he dislikes (Tommy Hilfiger, the Michelin Man, etc.) by having his heroine thrown into nausea by the very sight of them.  If humanity really does develop into a superficial culture obessed with online cotton candy like this, it will be sad.  I only kept reading to see if there ever turned out to be any sort of significance to the themes in the plot, only to discover that there really wasn't.  If you are a Gibson fan, perhaps this is zesty fare.  But as an appetizer for the uninitiated, it is mostly form and no substance.  Gibson depicts a humanity fascinated by momentary glimmers on the surface of cyberspace, never realizing the depths beneath before they flit off to the next thing.  Perhaps a future novel will concern the Luddite backlash of a sort of cyberspace Amish faction, who have learned that less is more.s hunted by various mysterious individuals who are not who they seem, and she can trust no one.   <br /> <br />Personally I was amused by Gibson's using this format to pontificate upon which logos and brands he dislikes (Tommy Hilfiger, the Michelin Man, etc.) by having his heroine thrown into nausea by the very sight of them.

I happened across this book in a bookstore and went to the library to read it for free.  After doing so, I found myself reflecting on it so frequently that I bought my own copy and also some additional copies to give to others.<br /><br />In our culture of personal autonomy and responsibility the burden of making informed decisions requires that we indeed BECOME informed about each thing in order to make decisions intelligently.  Unfortunately, we are awash in information, marketing, and choices so that we must first either filter our choices, closing off other options, pick randomly, being influenced by factors outside our awareness, or never make the choice at all.<br /><br />This book looks at the area of shopping and commercial products but it occurs to me that it is relevant to many more areas as well:  politics - who can keep track of all the issues/legislation/candidates? Writing - not writing until you've thought of the \\"perfect phrase\\" is the very definition of writer's block.  Religion - in the face of so many creeds we wonder what to believe, and wait too until too late at the deathbed.  Careers - would I be more successful/happier elsewhere?  Education - what if I majored in something else, went to another school?  Relationships - perpetually \\"keeping options open\\" instead of committing to someone.  Investing - will you have a golden or bleak retirement based on your choices in the stock market?  Entertainment - you could spend an hour cycling through all the cable channels rather than watching a program.  Virtually every area of life has applicability.  Instead of being able to take the time to evaluate every option, we often default and go by instinct, past habit, or fail to decide, not realizing that time is running out of our mortal hourglass.  We are like tourists at the Smithsonian running from exhibit to exhibit, trying to see it all before closing time, and experiencing nothing.<br /><br />The author presents useful strategies to filter the plethora of choices we face, such as selecting the \\"good enough\\" that meets our criteria instead of waiting for the \\"best,\\" consciously narrowing our options, practicing an attitude of gratitude, etc.  But the greatest value will come to the reader who, after reading this book, puts it down and reflects on its applicability to the specific choices of one's own life.  We each have only 24 hours per day, and the clock is running., such as selecting the \\"good enough\\" that meets our criteria instead of waiting for the \\"best,\\" consciously narrowing our options, practicing an attitude of gratitude, etc.  But the greatest value will come to the reader who, after reading this book, puts it down and reflects on its applicability to the specific choices of one's own life.

Based on his work with individuals with \\"phantom limbs\\" and other brain injuries, he has found some surprising realities about how the brain works and how \\"consciousness\\" is mediated by the brain.  It will cause the reader to ponder the nature of the \\"self\\" and what that may be.  Do we have a soul?  The author steers clear of religious conclusions, but the implication is that a personality is only the emergent quality of animate biology, and when it dies \\"we\\" cease to exist.  The author seems to feel that this is a benign concept but I think many others would despair to think that awareness ends with physical death.  When the tv is unplugged, the screen is blank, and if we study the tv's inner circuitry we must conclude that there was nothing there but hardware.  Yet the tv broadcast, unperceived by us, goes on all around.<br /><br />I think this book is a good introduction to the subject, asking questions that future science should answer.	2005-02-22

(The other volumes are:  \\"Martin Luther:  His Road to Reformation,\\" and \\"Martin Luther: Shaping and Defining the Reformation.\\")  This volume deals with Luther's life after the glory days of the 95 Theses, Diet of Worms, and gradual acceptance and establishment of the Reformation.  Luther the Doctor of Theology is beset by health problems and grows old and cantankerous, having limited patience to respond to the errors of supporters and opponents alike.  Enduring great physical illness and miseries, he longs for life to end.  But he continues to guide Melancthon and other reformers as they develop the foundational documents of Lutheran theology.  At the end of his life, he confidently affirms the gospel he has preached.<br /><br />Many histories of Luther gloss over this period in his life.  It was therefore interesting to see how the aged Luther continued to face ordinary problems of politics and church governance, and also ever-emerging errors in theology among those who accepted the reformation as well as its opponents.  He continued to face his \\"Anfectungen\\" (feelings of despair and condemnation) and frequently needed to cling to Christ's mercy and be reminded of the Gospel.  I found this comforting, to see that even such a giant of the faith was not immune to doubt all through his life.<br /><br />This volume is shorter than the preceding two, and I feel that maybe the author rushed through it a little bit, as it does not seem as in-depth as his earlier volumes.  However, I am glad that he pressed forward to complete the trilogy and allow us to see this part of Luther's life.  This volume also includes interesting illustrations, including a drawing of Luther a year before his death, showing his physical decline, the house where Luther died, his gravestone, a cast of his hands, and a drawing of the dead Luther's face.	2005-02-22

He suggests that the &quot;creative class&quot; must become conscious of their identity as a class and begin to act in concert, but he doesn't outline a method for doing this.  One would think that he would want to provide a platform for the unification and interaction of a class which he has identified.<br />The author suggests that municipalities would be wise to structure their geography to attract creative class individuals.  Another approach, which he does not consider, would be a strategy to develop more creative class individuals from the resident population.  Unlike other natural resources, which are finite, creative class capital can be generated by educational opportunities and personal development.<br />An interesting thought occurred to me while reading this book:  Dr. Florida describes creative class individuals as uninterested in group conformity.  Meanwhile, the major political parties become increasingly polarized and intolerant of dissent within the ranks, sidelining independent-thinking &quot;moderates.&quot;  Thus public policy is being developed by parties who have driven the creative class out from their midst.  This, more than anything, may be the most critical issue for the creative class to confront.	2004-05-19

It gives a good understanding of meteorology and clouds, developing everything clearly.  I have since taken several meteorology courses and read numerous books about the weather, but nothing has ever explained things as well or as simply as this book did.  This book is filled with full-color illustrations, distinguishing it from most other books that just have black and white illustrations.	2004-04-29

He also makes a lot of generalizations and has a short and simplistic consideration of the nature of a supreme being.  However, the book advances ideas that would be good for the author or others to fully develop in further, more detailed works.	2004-01-21

The author writes an interesting chronicle of the house's former inhabitants. It's disconcerting to reflect upon the fact that others owned our home before us, and we will leave it to others when we're gone.  It's a reminder of how temporary our lives are, in our few hours upon the stage.  Each generation, with all its hubris, is only a chapter, or a few pages, within the book of life.	2002-09-19

Very good read!	2002-05-30

It characterizes &quot;manhood&quot; in six &quot;stages&quot;, each having their own purpose and issues.  It put into words notions that I've been meditating  about myself, as I get older.  &quot;When I was a child, I thought like a  child...but when I became a man, I put away childish things.&quot;  I read  the book in one sitting and plan to reread it often for new insights as I  go through my own journey.	1999-08-27

The story shifts from the mysterious activities of  Abbe Sauniere, to a convoluted web of lines and  conjecture based on COPIES of &quot;parchments&quot; supposedly found by  Sauniere.  Links of correlation between these and various paintings are  also very tenuous.  The fact that paintings have geometric composition and  arrangement proves nothing in this regard.  One may draw endless triangles,  squares, etc on any painting and rotate it to match up with a map. I will  grant that MAYBE there is indeed a &quot;hidden treasure,&quot; but I was  not convinced that it must be the &quot;body of Christ.&quot;  This was not  proved in my opinion.  If Christ survived his crucifixion, why did he then  go into hiding?  If he hadn't intended to be crucified all along as a  sacrifice for sin, why did he say it?  Are the gospel accounts false?  If  he did intend to be crucified, and survived, he failed in his goal.  Further, how could Templars or anyone, especially a thousand years later,  know whether a body was that of Christ?  What would be the proof?  What  would be our proof now? The assertions here are monumental in scope, a  conspiracy to put any &quot;UFO coverup&quot; or &quot;JFK assassination  conspiracy&quot; to shame, a conspiracy across time, generations, cultures,  and countries.  The evidence must therefore be also monumentally  compelling.  I did not find it so.  &quot;If Christ is not raised, your  faith is futile and you are still in your sins...we are of all men most to  be pitied.&quot;	1999-06-07

Now, in PALE BLUE DOT,  Sagan has once again returned us to the journey and the wonder.<br /><br />Sagan's  basic message: \\"Due to our actions or inactions, and the misuse of our  technology, we live at an extraordinary moment, for the Earth at least--the  first time that a species has become able to wipe itself out. But this is  also, we may note, the first time that a species has become able to journey  to the planets and the stars. The two times, brought about by the same  technology, coincide--a few centuries in the history of a 4.5  billion-year-old planet...Our leverage on the future is high just  now.\\"  And, he says, in the process of journeying out to the stars our  species will inevitably be transformed. Having left our home in search of  the stars, we will encounter many other worlds which may prove more  challenging to our efforts to populate. More and more, humanity will look  back with reverence at the home world, appreciate and cherish the  \\"pale blue dot\\" that gave us birth.<br /><br />This book was one of the  last works of Carl Sagan before his untimely death due to cancer.	1998-11-17
