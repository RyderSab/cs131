US	15461484	RP4H328G3N4T1	0375726810	446299605	The Last of the Wine	Books	3	2	3	N	Y	compelling	This is the first novel I read by late Ms Renault, a best selling author I admit I know nothing about.<br /><br />First of all a comment on this edition: one has to take real pains to understand who is speaking, as the characters' speeches follow each other on the same line with a questionable use of punctuation. In a novel where dialogue is rich and continuous one can imagine how fortunate this is.<br />Someone should also have told the publisher that the cover picture, though beautiful in itself, has nothing to do with the Vth century b.C. Greece Ms Renault takes so much pain to depict.<br /><br />This author has a beautiful sense of storytelling: the plot itself is nothing new to a contemporary reader, the love and friendship of two young men in a Greece illuminated by Sokrates' thinking and devastated by a cruel war, but she tells it, simply and compellingly, and she never fails to keep her reader's interest.<br /><br />Before discussing the book's flaws I wish to stress how this novel stands out among ordinary fiction. This told, one has to point out that the philosophing is often clumsy; the competitions rhetorical and the overall style not always as polished as in some paragraphs Ms Renault ha clearly written with more care.<br /><br />To me there is another flaw but I admit it would be unjust to give it undue weight, this book belonging to a woman probably born at the beginning of the century.<br />She writes with ease of the homosexual liaisons typical of ancient Greece, making no fuss about them and giving her attention to the feelings involved, but she betrays her embarassment when dealing with her two main heroes: she makes two disciples of Sokrates' ideas about love of them, thus avoiding too close physical intimacy between the two; later, when they finally surrender to their passion, the fact is hardly mentioned and NEVER quoted again.	2005-10-12

Part a gay romance, part hard s-f, part philosophy.<br /><br />Curiously enough, it is the gay romance the least accomplished part. The author's intent was probably to stress how the love between Chrome and Vortex is inevitable. Well, to do so, he goes on describing undescribable emotions and on the long run, he gets sticky.<br /><br />The two other parts are interesting enough: the world depicted here is particularly depressing, a kind of oligarchy whose only interest is to deprive people of what makes them different from each other and valuable. The only possible way out for the main hero is to escape Earth, a sort of metaphysical death.<br /><br />The writing is professional, the author is particularly good at descriptions of locations. The story is slow but stirs emotions anyway.<br /><br />Not a masterpiece, a pleasant read.	2005-10-03

Absolutely not.<br /><br />If you accept the assumptions, the story is fast paced, entertaining, even funny at times. The author is particularly good at action scenes which is no minor achievement for a debutant as he was at the time.<br /><br />A good job with no pretences, suitable for people over 16 because of some violence and gore.	2005-09-23

As a matter of fact he must be: not a single redundant description, not a clumsy turn of phrase, not a wasted word are to be found in this extremely fast paced story, too short to be a real novel.<br /><br />This is so true I found myself considering if a couple more pages would not have bettered an already breathtaking narration giving it a little more depth.<br /><br />The plot is original and interesting, flashbacks short and always to the point, characterization consistent and focused. The reader has to be able to catch subtle hints, sometimes, but if he/she manages to do it, not a single fact looks unjustified.<br /><br />Many reviewers have complained about gore and violence: both are present, the main character being a bloodthirsty, selfish son of a b...h, but blood and (homosexual) sex are never indulged upon, they just look like necessary engines to push the story forward.<br /><br />Mr Schiefelbein seems much more interested in outlining the complex attitude of his characters towards religion and he does it tastefully, though I think a catholic reader might argue with me on this.<br /><br />This is an excellent read, entertaining, which seems to fall short of literature out of choice rather than out of limits. It should not be read by minors or sensitive people.	2005-09-03

Ms Le Guin deliberately keeps the story's profile low so that even the adventure filled escape of the main hero from an hostile country highlights the majesty of the landscapes of the planet he has landed on.<br /><br />Unfortunately both the impressive landscapes and the political intrigue are not interesting enough to be stretched for 300 pages and what she achieves , more than a believable matter of fact report of a first approach of two cultures, is an unavoidable sense of dullness.<br /><br />Chapeau to the writer's skills, which are many, but, sorry, I still think a book has to be entertaining in the first place.	2005-09-02

And he bothers, ooohhh so much, about political correctness, to the point of being funny, at least for a European.<br /><br />On the other hand his story is not bad at all and with all its writing flaws he manages to suspend disbelief and to drag the reader into it. I came to care for Desmond, just as if he was a friend of mine. This is not a little achievement for an unexperienced writer.<br /><br />A bit of light, homoerotic reading, perfect for a rainy winter afternoon, and it shouldn't be out of print.	2005-08-16

The sense of an anthology is to regroup the same genre and even if you disagree with this the cover states this book be a collection of queer fantasy short stories.<br /><br />No one of the tales is a real hit: Wizard's Moon is fairly interesting but needs more polishing; Candleglow is about the same only a bit confused by the richness of events. Persephone Ascending has enormous potential but suffer under the ovious restraint of space and in fact we are told the author is working to expand it.<br /><br />Once Upon a Time, Messenger, Centauri and Midnight Confession are interesting but severely flawed.<br /><br />I do not wish to be misunderstood: these attempts are not unworthy, they have their merit and are better written than many novels around: simply they are not worth all the money the book costs.	2005-08-16

Ms Scott has probably tried to avoid extensive boring explanations but confronted with such an exotic creation the reader must necessarily fill in the voids.<br /><br />One may wonder, is this still SF? In a sense it is. Do not read this novel if you just want an easy SF pastime. Do it if you welcome food for thought and are in the right mood for it.<br /><br />A note: sex is necessarily mentioned  in such a book, but it is never graphic or vulgar: teens can read it freely provided they have the right attitude toward demanding books.tioned  in such a book, but it is never graphic or vulgar: teens can read it freely provided they have the right attitude toward demanding books.	2005-08-13

It is the first of what was apparently meant to be a trilogy, the last volume of which has not been published, as far as I know.<br /><br />The story is good if not particularly original and the setting, a country bordered by sea, marshes and desert allows many engaging clashes among characters belonging to different cultures, clashes the author seems to be willing to stress whereas magic or supernatural elements are nearly absent.<br /><br />All this told, the book could have been better.<br /><br />The writing lacks any attempt at beauty, which though not necessary in itself point out to distinguished authors. Phrasing is sometimes very confused and I found it hard to understand some passages, particularly action scenes.<br /><br />There is plenty of characters, none of them particularly well rounded with the possible exception of the two main heroes who have a great potential but are not fully drawn and result in not being really endearing. The main characterization's flaw is that we are never explained why the leads come to like each other in the first place: both men with a past, many personal problems and inner depths, they simply take a sudden and deep liking for each other, just so.<br /><br />A last note: I do not know whether the author meant it (reading the second volume will possibly help) but there is a rather strong gay subtext in the relationship between the two: nothing graphic, not even any explicit mention of the fact, but one can feel it nevertheless.	2005-08-10

As other reviewers have pointed out, the plot twists are such as to shame any soap opera writer and this flaw taints the novel so much as to make it very slow at times.<br /><br />On the other hand we are faced with a most talented writer: his descriptions are minute, detailed to the point of being fastidious. His use of the language is simply beautiful: night and shadow are a constant background but every description he conceives is lyrical. Mr Bailey pays much attention to everyday aspects of life but in a way he manages to sublimate them into poetical images.<br /><br />His treatment of characters is understated: in a most dark, ambiguous, grim atmosphere which dims even the most gruesome deaths (and there is a lot of violence in this book, only muted) Innowen and the others slide silently as if afraid to stir the wrath of the rarely mentioned but omnipresent gods of their land.<br />Only in time we are explicitly told that the deep attachment of Innowen and Razkili is love: though we understand this love to be an extremely passionate one, we watch it on tip toe, fearful of disturbing the hero while he discovers he does not love the witch as he believed before and he slowly comes to admit he cares for his friend and companion of five years. By the way here is a major contradiction: in this world homosexuality is no issue for anyone and still Innowen seems ashamed to love his companion: I guess Mr Bailey wanted this to be a fear to love in general but he omitted any explanation and it looks like Innowen fears his love of men.<br />Luckily enough he does not forget anything else and though sex between the two is never graphic, well it is never mentioned as such, actually, we look with pleasure at the growing intimacy of their touching.<br /><br />This is an original, interesting read suited for anyone (gay or straight) who is at least 16 y.o. provided he has some superficial knowledge of ancient history and a love for beautiful writing.this to be a fear to love in general but he omitted any explanation and it looks like Innowen fears his love of men.<br />Luckily enough he does not forget anything else and though sex between the two is never graphic, well it is never mentioned as such, actually, we look with pleasure at the growing intimacy of their touching.<br /><br />This is an original, interesting read suited for anyone (gay or straight) who is at least 16 y.o. provided he has some superficial knowledge of ancient history and a love for beautiful writing.	2005-07-15

The loss is painful, especially because the \\"others\\" were so endearing in the first volume. As a consequence every time Segnbora is not involved the story becomes slow, sometimes it even drags.<br /><br />Hardly an excusable mistake considering the years Ms Duane allowed herself to write the three volumes (the fourth is at the time still unpublished).	2005-06-29

Only through real understanding can a person achieve real power.<br /><br />This concept and many other throughout the book may sound very wiccan, but just take a short look at the original publishing date to realize that Ms Duane follows no literary fashion but establishes her own.<br /><br />Herewiss' (the main hero) quest for his birthright blue fire magic is a phylosophical journey to awareness: though charming and beautiful, he is also self willed and sometimes even dense.<br /><br />The other characters of this  first volume are more functional than really well rounded, with the possible exception of Sunspark, who is deeply entertaining.<br /><br />Ms Duane's writing is never easy and not always proficient: some theoretical pages tend to be a bit convolute and dull, but generally speaking she manages to express her idea(l)s in clear, challenging paragraphs. Some are even lyrical, deeply moving: one really feels the depth of her motives even if one does not share them.<br /><br />A word of caution for touchy people: there is a lot of sex in this book, never graphic, but it is not only essential in the author's Weltanschauung but for the plot too.<br /><br />Every single character (even the goddess) has a very no nonsense attitude regarding any kind of mating: Herewiss is deeply in love with another man, a childhood friend, but both of them \\"share\\" with other people following their instincts.<br /><br />In Ms Duane's world this is perfectly allright because the goddess encourages any kind of love and once in a while she descends among her creatures to share her love with them.<br /><br />An interesting book, worth reading because of its depth.

For further comment about the setting, please refer to the other book's review here at Amazon.<br /><br />In this first work, the author seems to concentrate nearly exclusively, on the depiction of the nobility, the actions (and deaths) of any other people treated with a superficiality and unconcern typical of the old fashioned fantasies of many years ago. In The Painter Knight she amends this mistake and the world depicted there gains in depth and loses some of its untolerable classism.<br /><br />The two main characters, Demnor and Kehlanus, are well rounded, most endearing, enjoyable; their (homosexual) love is a charming mixture of realism, jealousy and romance and it is in fact the main asset of the book. The side character are not as polished but they fit in quite nicely.<br /><br />The problem of the book, one only few reviewer have underlined, is that the pacing of the story is slow, sometimes even awkward if not clumsy, betraying an unexperienced if talented author. In the last third of the book Ms Patton loses focus, apparently unable to deal with the many issues she has gathered: war and its useless bloodsheds, nationalism, religious conflicts, political intrigue, power thirst, the conflict between the intimate wishes of public people and harsh necessity; but also the personal problems of Demnor, torn by love, jealousy, the confusing growth of the new affection for his wife, his tormented relationship with his late mother and queen.<br /><br />Despite what many other reviewers say, I think Ms Patton handles the time shifts (or flashbacks) in the novel in a neat and proficient way. Her idea of a society where men and women are absolutely equal is disconcerting but refreshing and consistently outlined.<br /><br />An interesting if imperfect debut, worth reading.d queen. <br /> <br />Despite what many other reviewers say, I think Ms Patton handles the time shifts (or flashbacks) in the novel in a neat and proficient way.

This last book is quite hard to put down.<br /><br />Dirk, the main character, is now interesting, lovable; Marqel and Tia, who previously seemed rather lunatic and unbelievable, finally act consistently. On the other hand Ms Fallon loses grasp of the two main villains: one dies and the other becomes pale and vague.<br /><br />The writing is neat, always to the point, with lot of humour and a bit of slang as if the author finally had relaxed a little.

She also seems determined to develop a richly detailed political intrigue and takes pains so that each main character plays an important role in it.<br /><br />Magic is absent in her world, though the main character's mathematical skills easily border the supernatural.<br /><br />Ms Fallon's treatment of the religious issues has earned her many critics: frankly I do not see their point: she discusses how religion can be twisted and abused to serve human greed and malice, which is what her main villain constantly does but she is neither spiteful nor disrespectful. I expect one can hardly discuss world's history in the past centuries without mentioning how religion played an important role in every existing intrigue.<br /><br />If the setting is intriguing it is also the only real asset of the book: Ms Fallon's writing is professional enough but the story moves slowly onward, sometimes it even drags. Characterization is good but not satisfying: the high priestess is well rounded, just as much as the Lion of Senet and it is very clear that she spent much time on these two villains of hers. Dirk, the main hero, who is supposed to be the smartest man living, acts inconsistently to say the least and the others hardly deserve any mentioning.<br /><br />Another problem is that Ms Fallon's objectivity may be justified from her analytical point of view but it also fails to stir emotions. One cannot feel for the characters, one cannot take much interest for the land of Ranadon. For me it was like reading a well drafted report on something I do not really care for.	2005-06-01

Writing is fairly neat but it builds little tension and this book is very easy to put down.<br />I surprised myself to think: \\"How many pages still?\\" more often than it is good for a fantasy book.<br /><br />Little emotion, little tension, little interest. This time Mr Williams has not worked well.	2005-05-23

Her writing is as neat as it is cold, it pushes the story on well but it stirs no emotion.<br />Characters lack depth, interesting emotional issues are sadly neglected. The love between the hero and the emperor (a potentially wonderful character) is stated and sometimes described, but curtly and icily. Many plot points feel like they would have welcomed further discussion.<br /><br />In the hands of a competent writer (I am thinking about Lynn Flewelling) this could have been a much longer and better book. As it is it has left me dissatisfied, the many open knots of the ending so much the worse for it.	2005-05-13
US	15461484	R3JHO4HRC8COWT	0441010377	208749477	The King	Books	1	14	17	N	Y	Disappointing	(I am not a native speaker, please overlook my style)<br /><br />After reading \\"The Still\\" (see my review) I approached its sequel with great expectation and was sadly disappointed. Mr Feintuch seems to have lost focus and this book suffers from shabbyness, inconsistencies, ill plotting and a general lack of inspiration that will surprise anyone who has read \\"The Still\\".<br /><br />SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER<br /><br />To continue this review I must quote several accidents of the plot. If you do not wish to know it in advance, stop reading NOW.<br /><br />The first part of the book is perhaps the worst. The author did not think fit to give a proper r&eacute;sum&eacute; so he quotes accidents from the first book as some accounting clerk would quote figures. He seems then to realize how slowly the plot crawls and decides to let Rustin die, giving us some melodramatic account of Rodrigo's mourning.<br /><br />From then on the story carvart on with clumsy twists, some tolerable enough, others not at all.<br /><br />The characterization, which was for sure the main asset of The Still, is now seriously flawed if not unbelievable. The side characters are neglected and act inconsistently, entering and exiting the plot stream at the author's whim.<br /><br />Rodrigo and Rustin are harder for me to judge because there are both objective clumsynesses and my entirely personal dislike of what Mr Feintuch decides about them.<br /><br />The masochistic love between the two is only heightened and does not evolve: Rodrigo pledges complete obedience to his beloved but keeps on acting willfully with no understandable intent except getting beaten again and again. After the (too) many pages in The Still on this matter, this point becomes kind of stale. On the other hand Rodrigo denies Rustin any further physical intimacy and Rustin, as always, accepts meekly.<br /><br />Then Rustin gets killed. Rodrigo goes crazy but suddenly becomes all noble and valiant for a 200 pages until he decides he cannot bear the loss and he uses magic to summon his lover back. I admit I feel unconfortable with the idea of time shifts (very common in SF) but I also think Mr Feintuch handled it badly.<br /><br />In the last part of the novel Rodrigo suddenly realizes that it is Rustin who prevents him from becoming a real man and sends him away mercylessly, he fights some more battles and wins back his crown, just in time to marry Tresa.<br /><br />Rustin is much paler a character here, the author denies him any depth and development. His homosexual love for the supposedly straight (PLEEEEAAASE!!!) Rodrigo, however deep, must give place to the much more \\"mature\\" love of Tresa. Bleah...<br /><br />Mr Feintuch's intent, clearly understandable if one reads carefully the last pages, is to assess a fantasy world where no escapism is allowed to the reader and where life is just as grim as our own life is. In The Still this was acceptable because of the outstanding quality of the writing. Here the reader is overcome by shabbyness and he/she is allowed no happy end either.

In some way they are right: no impossibly evil demon is to be found in this supposedly alternative medieval world and no courageous knight either.<br /><br />Mr Feintuch is a distinguished writer, he plots well and uses a pleasant language. Few minor inconsistencies, a few redundant pages, some occasional flaws here and there such as the insisted examples of Rodrigo's weaknesses hardly diminish the value of this long novel.<br />Yet, as much as this book be very hard to put down, all I felt while reading it was sorrow and irritated bitterness: I am not sure I shall be willing to read it again.<br /><br />The medieval world outlined by Mr Feintuch is much too akin to ours: war, greed, misery and death lurk everywhere; characters are moved only by their selfish needs, none of them is free from pain or failings.<br />The two main characters are another problem: who is Rodrigo after all if not a vermin, a cruel, useless, stupid, selfish scoundrel who soils the very earth he walks upon? He is the villain of this novel; hard a thing to swallow for any fantasy reader, I admit, especially because Mr Feintuch achieves real genius in creating this so to say \\"hero\\". How can a reader seeking entertainment be willing to identify with such a god forlorn creature unless he/she is ready to take a trip to the meanest, darker side of his/her own human nature and teenage memories and recognize them as his/her own?<br />Rodrigo grows up in the second half of the novel but his taints, though lessened and more disciplined, are still there and the ugly scar that disfigures half of his formerly very handsome face seems only a fitting outward representation of the rottenness within.<br />Again, what about his relationship with beautiful, amiable, valiant Justin? How can any reader be pleased with this masochistic love where roles switch swiftly and the torturer easily becomes the victim?<br />Once more the author's characterization is masterly: at first sight Justin seems the noble fellow, the good natured older mentor any fantasy novel hero needs to complete his quest. He is NOT. Out of a love where very little is noble he allows Rodrigo to injure and abuse him again and again. Rodrigo acknowledges no real love to Justin, he spits repeatedly in his (Justin's) face that he only makes love to him (to Justin) instead of girls because he has no other choice. Justin accepts it all, meekly, or possibly unleashes his temper and slaps Rodrigo silly.<br />How can a reader cherish such a soul rending love, where the pain of the blows the two men deliver each other surely outbalance the few moments of real intimacy?<br /><br />I am not sure whether Mr Feintuch meant his novel to be so harsh and painful or whether he was aware of the outcome, I would think he was not. It is nonetheless a masterpiece which easily trespass the border of genre fiction: a crude one, for sure, unfit for youngsters and for young at heart.there and the ugly scar that disfigures half of his formerly very handsome face seems only a fitting outward representation of the rottenness within.<br />Again, what about his relationship with beautiful, amiable, valiant Justin?

Their feelings, their weaknesses, their interaction are fully and convincingly believable but such finesse does not hinder the story's tension.<br />I was charmed by the way Ms Huff develops the birth and growth of the love the two men feel for one another: both are very conscious of the other man's flaws and both have reasons to avoid such an involvement but they cannot help themselves: the author is particularly subtle in avoiding any rhetoric and she gains in insight. I expect even straight readers to feel moved about it.<br /><br />Two main flaws, both unforgivable because they spoil what could be a nearly perfect book:<br />- the characters are aged 16, 19 and 23 and this is really disturbing because throughout the book I felt them to act and think older than their age: five years at least should have been added to them.<br />- the second one is the ending of the book. it gives the bizarre idea Ms Huff was told her book was becoming too long and she should better cut it short. tension slackens a lot and the writing seems hurried.<br /><br />!!! SPOILER !!! SPOILER !!! SPOILER !!!<br />Moreover the sort of menage a trois she finds out to settle her characters in is first of all superficially outlined and secondly deeply irritating and unsatisfying: one simply does not want believe that the two lovers, after having struggled, could accept it, even if they both are very fond of the young girl.<br />!!! SPOILER !!! SPOILER !!! SPOILER !!!<br /><br />I think Ms Huff should reconsider this most annoying ending in a new edition of this work, just as much as the publisher should feel ashamed about letting such a good book go out of print. I had to buy it used and if it is true that Amazon makes it fairly easy a thing to do I doubt it a sufficient number of second hand volumes may be provided to give each sword and sorcery lover his/her copy.<br /><br />The publisher should also be told that such stupid hints and comments on the backcover as are to be found in this could easily dissuade a reader from buying the book.k Ms Huff should reconsider this most annoying ending in a new edition of this work, just as much as the publisher should feel ashamed about letting such a good book go out of print.

It is a writing made of small touches, light shades, always neat if not always moving.<br /><br />The problem here lies with the story: hard as I tried, I could not get involved nor get to love her characters.<br />We have a love sick young artist, doomed by cancer to die early in a world where an intimidating science nearly always guarantees a healthy, long lasting life. This device, if a bit cerebral, could in itself be touching but, in this case, it left me cold.<br />I wanted to feel for the main hero, his lost lover being another man should have helped me identifying, but I simply never could.<br /><br />It seems to me that Ms Lynn was absent minded while writing this story: while retaining her usual skill she was not and could not move.	2005-05-03

Some inconsistencies and strained passages are the price she must pay for her stylistical choice.<br /><br />The plot is hardly an original one, the same old story of the same old boy next door turning out to be more than he looks like and saving the day in a rather pompous way, but there is a good tension and some good climaxes. Writing is pleasant an rich (overrich?) with details and background information.<br />Some situations tend to become repetitive after a while and in my opinion a good editor could have suggested some cuts.<br />Characterization is a bit commonplace, with the villains being despicably so and the heroes unfaltering in any difficult condition.<br />On the other hand irony and lightness lighten up several pages.<br />Making the Border the home of any fairy creature ever known to fantastic literature, from unicorns to dragons to elfs, is probably an exaggeration but it is tolerable.<br /><br />This book is certainly not a masterpiece but it manages to be entertaining.<br /><br />P.S. a more accurate blurb, especially on the bookcover would not have hurt.	2005-05-03

Writing is fairly good and to the point but could be more polished and achieve both more beauty and more tension: from the first page I knew there was going to be a happy ending and as much as I love my endings to be happy I still wish to get more thrills.<br />I would not be writing this if I did not believe Ms Brite to have much potential. Some pages are just professional but just as many wield real power: raw and uncouth but thrilling one to the bone with luscious descriptions, meaningful dialogues, clever innuendoes. She just needs more focus.<br /><br />Nominally this is a horror but the author is evidently much more interested in her characters' interaction: they are faceted, interesting, endearing. The side ones are well rounded and believable; the two main ones just adorable: their love grows quickly but convincingly and you feel for them before you know it.<br /><br />There are some sex scenes and they are explicit, graphic, intense: I do not know how a woman could write this well about gay male sex but her sex scenes are perhaps the best parts of the whole novel.<br /><br />The ending is satisfying, it leaves no loose threads and allows one to think \\"and they lived happily ever after\\", which is a very good thing.<br /><br />just a short poisonous comment: one of the two main heroes is bisexual... \\"ms brite, please, be aware that true bisexuality is such a hard thing to find...\\"	2005-05-03

On the one hand I love fantasies, especially if they have gay characters, but I usually find even the best detective-stories dull.<br />This is a classical detective-story set in an alternative XVI century French-like kingdom.<br /><br />The two authors outline a believable society and they enrich their descriptions with many interesting and witty details: the result, admirable though it is, is overwhelming and yet it would have born more development.<br />Writing is professional and subtle but the story develops slowly and many details one is expecting because of their approach are still absent.<br /><br />This lack of fulfilment involves the main characters as well: one knows the two leads are going to fall in love with each other (it happens in the sequel) but although the authors describe their mimic to the smallest detail in a very pleasant way, they hold too much behind and one cannot really understand who they really are and why they should fall in love. Just the same happens for the lovely character of Istre: saying too much about him could be a mistake but one has no idea about his emotions. The authors hint at a possible emotional opening between him and Rathe's neighbour but they drop it and never mention it again.<br /><br />This objectification might be considered all right in a common detective-story, where the main point is solving of the mistery, but is hardly satisfying here.<br />As it is this story has potential but feels incomplete.	2005-05-03

Plot twists are either predictable or unbelievable.<br /><br />World building is rather oppressive because of the amount of details but not entirely believable (even for fantasy standards); the quality of assassin of the hero and his training as such, which should be a primarily source of interest, are sadly lacking definition.<br /><br />To this one must add that characterization is unconvincing: the villain is so incredibly egotistical and stupid no one could believe him capable of such refined treasoning: a real, skilled assassin would have dispatched him after a few pages.

He made me scream with vexation because of his weaknesses: Ms huff brings to life a man you simply want to give a good smack first and go to bed with after.<br />The other characters are well rounded, finely depicted with special mention for the main villain, a woman I simply wanted to throttle painfully and slowly to death.<br /><br />Two flaws:<br />the ending is too succint and brutal: after building so much tension in the heart of your reader you MUST allow him/her to untie these knots with a satisfying, extended ending. this does not happen and i found myself staring at the last page hungering for some release.<br />Ms Huff, as nearly all of her she-fellow-writers is bold enough to write about same sex relationships and she does it with pleasant and commendable open mindedness.<br />Still she seems to be convinced that a gay character (and Benedict IS gay, after all) can feel at least sexual attraction not just for one but for every woman. Surely enough these are fantasy worlds, so the author is entitled to write what she likes about sexual habits, but in my experience most gay men are unable to feel physically for a woman (let alone ANY woman) whereas they MAY feel attracted to her mind.<br />True bisexuality is in my experience very seldom to be found.<br /><br />This notwithstanding the liaison between Benedict and Bannon (a lovely character) is moving and touching and Benedict's proneness for physical contact with kigh (the elementals bards command) is teasing.<br /><br />Because of the shocking brutality of many pages I strongly recommend no youngster be allowed to read this bookmoving and touching and Benedict's proneness for physical contact with kigh (the elementals bards command) is teasing.

Some reviewers say it is true to the legend: should it be really so, part of the problem might lie in the original plot and yet the author could have done something to amend that.<br />Be it as it may, her characters are exceptionally dull -except for the elderly couple- and Elfland is lushiously boring, its beautiful queen being the worst of all.<br /><br />The verses included are enjoyable.	2005-03-20

Hill's review.<br /><br />It is not the plot or her writing skill (both lacking) that make this novel (and the whole series) readable but the emotional impact of the book: Ms Lackey perfectly knows how to hit someone's sensitivity, how to stir emotions, how to make her main characters endearing and even if the developing of the story is not what one could wish it is very easy to suspend any critisism.<br /><br />Despite its flaws and a serious need for editorial care (so many typos and plot inconsistencies are hardly to be tolerated) this novel keeps you awake at night to finish it. Even the ending, while rhetorical, still manages to work.<br /><br />Not a book I should recommend as a masterwork but a leasurable reading for sure.	2005-03-12

(I am not a native speaker, please overlook my style)<br /><br />Many reviewers have pointed out this to be rather a Regency novel than a fantasy and they are quite right: there is no magic at all, no quest; nothing endangers the world as it is known to everyone.<br /><br />I feel like adapting the subtitle chosen by the author herself: \\"Drama of Manners\\" (instead of \\"melodrama\\": there is nothing extravagantly passionate in her writing).<br /><br />The world depicted here bears many resemblances to a preindustrial England, not only because of the English sounding names and titles of honour; the city itself, with its murky river and its socially marked districts looks very much like a xvii century London would, not to speak of the characters' continuous talking about weather and wool manufacturing.<br /><br />Manners are nearly everywhere: it is a constant care of the author to describe each of her characters by the way s/he speaks or acts or feigns, the last being the most usual of the three: psychological insights and flashbacks are quite rare, which is fortunate because she is not always proficient in them, whereas she shows a subtle mastery in dialogues and twists of humour.<br /><br />Drama is its undercurrent: people die in this world, sudden, cruel, unjustifiable deaths; luckily enough Ms Kushner avoids any direct judgement and the moral flaws seem to gain prominence through this device.<br /><br />The main flaw of this novel lies in the two main characters: St Vier is a rather pale one, though he gets better defined later on; his lover Alec is a bigger than life neurotic and one never really understands why. Their relationship, once one manages to suspend disbelief, is finely depicted but I always sense a woman's sensitivity in what is supposed to be a gay passion.<br />The villains are masterly outlined: all of them, with a special mention for the duchess: a splendid, poisonous butterfly with a wit as sharp as her malevolent tongue: I was charmed against my will and I expect only Glenn Close (or an older Kidman) could bring her to the screen.<br /><br />A shame this novel has not been filmed yet: in the expert hands of the director of \\"Dangerous Liaisons\\" it could reap Academy Awards. It is true that unless the director be a real genius all the masterly writing of Ms Kushner would be lost: the plot is convincing, the set is dashing but what really makes this novel worth reading is the writer's skill; she reminds me of Jane Austen (a very crude, cynical Austen, of course) and if she fails to compare, the sheer reminding is boundless praise.<br /><br />A note on this Bantam Spectra edition:<br />the novel is rather short, so the three short stories added, though disappointing in themselves, are a most welcome addition.<br />The quality of the book (paper/ink) is very poor as seems to be the (bad) habit with U.S. paperbacks (OUP's are just as poor but cost half as much); I did not expect to have to complain about an oversized praise placed right on the cover, be it one of george R.R.

The love story of Seregil and Alec is now established, lacking therefore the thrill of the first two books, but it is outlined with lovely subtlety.<br /><br />Ms Flewelling has made a wrong choice but it takes a very good writer to write a good book despite such a flawed background. It is worthwhile to read it and not only because of the previous good instalments.	2005-02-10

Nobody has been able to offer a non-homophobic argumentation.<br />One could also mention the fact that Ms Flewelling's characters do not spend their time (and our book's pages) in bed: they live their adventure-packed existences instead.<br /><br />The author is first of all a skilled writer, not something to be taken for granted in a genre where anyone putting dragons-sorcerers-knights -kings together seems to get published: i DO love epic fantasy but cannot stand shabby writing or nonsensical plots.<br />Even here the plot has its weakpoints, characterization is not always as polished as one may wish and there is a general tendency to exaggerate the emotional vulnerability of the leads, but the novel is one of those few that keep you awake at night to finish them.<br />The world created here is absolutely believable, political intrigues are reasonably wicked and well developed without becoming oppressive; magic is an essential part of the book but it is not its only raison d'etre.<br /><br />In this first episode the two heroes meet, get to know each other and live their first adventures together: Ms Flewelling is particularly subtle in not introducing them with long, naive descriptions: the characters act and we get to know them, even the depths of them, by their conduct. Flashbacks are very rare and fit perfectly in the story; the pace is nearly breathtaking.<br /><br />To sum up: the story is excellent, entertaining and reasonably escapist without being dumb; it could have even surpassed the boundaries of genre fiction if the author had chosen to leave it in a drawer for a couple of years and to reread it later with a severe critical attitude, to polish the remaining small flaws.<br /><br />Brutally: this book is fun, perfectly worth the money it costs and it bears rereading.entertaining and reasonably escapist without being dumb; it could have even surpassed the boundaries of genre fiction if the author had chosen to leave it in a drawer for a couple of years and to reread it later with a severe critical attitude, to polish the remaining small flaws.<br /><br />Brutally: this book is fun, perfectly worth the money it costs and it bears rereading.	2005-02-08
