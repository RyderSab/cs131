Perhaps thr author herself was very depressed after the war or found the changes in society difficult to cope with but it becomes increasingly difficult decide when the author is being satirical or when she is indulging in propaganda for her own prefered social setup. There are still some genuinely funny passages but many of the situations in the later books seem designed as showcases for the same conversations, jokes and prejudices that have already been overly laboured in previous books- for example the superiority of a classical education.There is a fair amount of subtlety in the depictions of the aristocracy and upper gentry but other 'classes' are frequently represented as mindless morons. It may be significant the Angela Thirkell has a greater following in America than in Britain where people (myself included evrn though this is written from Canada)can still remember the times when some of the books were written or have a greater knowledge of the social history of the times. If you find you enjoy the books and don't find parts of them irritating or depressing,carry on reading them but for someone who really wants to know what life was like after the Second World War in Britain it would be better to read non-fiction accounts or any fictional author of books set in the period other than Angela Thirkell.	2004-02-27

With this in mind I decided to write about some, and the result is a miniseries of Regencies that commences with Mr. Trelawney's Proposal. The novels feature heroes, linked by family or friendship, who are definite rogues-wickedly charming, wryly humorous, dangerously attractive. Good girls can't resist them. But innocence can be as captivating as sophistication: the heroines are more than a match for their jaded suitors.<br />Gentle widow Victoria Hart succeeds in taming and securing the devotion of cynical rake Viscount Courtenay in A Kind and Decent Man. His friend, Sir Richard Du Quesne, is equally predatory and disreputable in The Silver Squire, and relentlessly pursues unassuming spinster Emma Worthington...until she catches him and brings him very willingly to his knees.<br />As their separate stories unfold, the couples battle through a maelstrom of action and emotion. I hope you enjoy their passionate skirmishing, the laughter and tears that pave the way to harmony and happiness, as much as I have enjoyed writing the novels for you.<br />Mary Brendan<br />Personally I think the author has succeeded in her intentions.

Understand that for some, very strong views are held about which database product is best and why.  These views also extend into what a book on SQL Server should contain, should it be this book tells me exactly what I need to type in and thus is wonderful, or this book explains the concepts.  Whatever your views on the ideal database there does however seem to be a movement towards Microsoft SQL 2000 and this book will help you understand why this is happening.  If you are a sophisticated end-user and want to learn what is possible with SQL server then this book is recommended especially for searching for and retrieving data.  If you are a client reading through this book might help you when talking to the programmers to get your message across.  From a cost point of view it is quite an expensive book but compared to the cost of building a system and the value it can add the cost is reasonable.  It also comes with the complete text as an e-book on CD so searching for a topic is facilitated.  <br />If you want to understand if you should upgrade your existing SQL servers to SQL 2000, whether SQL 2000 will meet the requirements for your next project, this book is of use.  In parts it is technical but it is also readable.<br />It describes how Microsoft SQL works and why it is the product it is to day.  It covers general background that is simply not covered in other books.  It covers it in a practical way that also reflects the theoretical point of view.  I especially like the references to the ANSI SQL standards.<br />There is a section that talks about planning for an SQL database that goes into practical reasons why one RAID system is better than another but also when the cheaper solution is likely to be acceptable.  It also mentions the reasons why you need to backup and restore your database even if you are using RAID.<br />Basically one puts data into a database and one allows queries of that data.  Some data queries are simple, some are much more complex.  End users \\"All I want is a list of names\\" know what they want but often have difficulties with syntax, NULL values and outer joins. There is discussion of the value of NULL and lots of examples of joins including outer joins. How to protect your users from outer joins yet still use the power of them.  By the way if you are an end user who wants to query data Chapter 7 is all about querying data although you may need a programmer or DBA to help set up some of the more complex queries. Joins are much enhanced in this version by the way and may provide a business reason why you should upgrade.<br />Chapter 10 talks about the full text searching available in SQL 2000, using Microsoft Search Service including a discussion on maintaining full-text indexes and weights for complex searches and the reasons why the results from one installation may differ from another.  These searches can be quite specialised so the examples that come on the CD are useful to demonstrate some of the techniques.  It should be noted that the full text searching does use a stop word or noise list and there is a short discussion of the word-breaking algorithm used.<br />Chapter 11 talks about the use of batches, this is a technique promoted by Microsoft to minimise traffic on the network often a production bottleneck even on a LAN and very much so on a WAN or Internet connection.  Real world performance gains of ten-fold to the client are not uncommon.<br />Chapter 16 gives common sense advice about query tuning.  If you are an end user this is quite a good introduction to database tuning and how good systems are built.  Again parts are technical but the concepts are there including why you may wish to duplicate the database for data warehousing type and other decision support queries.<br />In summary this book is not essential to use SQL 2000 but it will assistmany in getting the most benefit from the product.	2001-01-04

As always with QUE books there is a list near the front of who they consider the potential audience to be.  It is fairly advanced and does concentrate on the Server and networking side of Windows 2000.  Windows 2000 does require planning before rolling out but for those who do especially in larger more complex networks there are some very nice management paybacks. <br />Personally I use operating systems but need to know what to recommend and why to clients who are putting in new systems.<br />For me this Que book was useful in that it gave me the major relevant differences between Windows NT 4.0 and Server 2000.  The parts I found of most interest where the security polices which were quite well explained, and Active Directory  for me the most important part of Windows 2000.  It gathers up information that readers require to get through the Microsoft CSE exams in a page or so at the end of each chapter so for those of us who really are interested in the concepts rather than the keystrokes to pass the exam can simply skip them.<br />There is a detailed discussion about RAID, file encryption and compression which may change the way you set up the hard drives on a fast server.  You should be aware though that the security included in Windows 2000 is not the ultimate level and there are a number of issues outside the scope of this book for those who have high security requirements.  I was pleased to see a discussion of backup, one area that is often overlooked.<br />The book is designed to highlight the new features from Windows NT 4.0, it contains relevant web page links, and cautions where an action might lead to unexpected or unpredictable results.  I found the tips from the author which describe shortcuts and alternative approaches useful especially as they seem to be based on experience.<br />In summary a useful book to get an overview of Windows 2000, other books are required to delve into each topic in depth.	2000-12-28

The book is well researched and well written.  The military characters in particular are rather fun and well drawn.  The author has managed to weave a number of bits of history into the story and they blend in very well to make a very plausible tale.<br />From the back cover of the Zebra paperback edition...<br />An Independent Woman<br />Braving the censure of the ton, Cymberly Winthrop decides to follow the drum by joining her father, Colonel Charles Winthrop, in Portugal.  No sooner is Cymberly in Lisbon than she witnesses a handsome man rescuing a drowning child.  That man is Geoffrey Ryder, a distant member of the family that cruelly disinherited Cymberly's mother.  She'd rather ignore her attraction to him- and welcome the attentions of another soldier- even though it is Geoffrey's kisses, and not her suitor's, that light the deepest ardor in her...<br />An Honorable Soldier<br />Geoffrey Ryder has never come upon anyone like Cymberly Winthrop.  Unlike most well bred ladies, Miss Winthrop is not above the unpleasant task of caring for the wounded.  If only she weren't so besotted with Lieutenant Fleming, a man of deceptive character.  But Geoffrey is up for the challenge, and somehow he will find a way to convince the woman he loves that he isn't the rogue she believes him to be-and that her heart belongs with him.	2000-12-08

The Victorian era could be harsh especially to an orphan and this is the tale of one.  This is not the type of book I prefer to read and so the three stars means more I don't wish to pass judgement on it.  It might be yours and Mary Nichols is not a bad author.<br />From the dust cover of the Orion hard back edition... <br />`Sarah Jane had cast a spell on him that first day on the banks of the stream, which would bind him to her for the rest of his life - and whoever or whatever came between them could never alter that.'<br />Set in the mid-Victorian era, against the wide water-colour  skies of the Fens, The Stubble Field is the story of Sarah Jane Winterday, a workhouse orphan who yearns to be a lady. While skivvying at Chevington House, she enjoys a rapturous summer liaison with a mysterious young man, who gives her two love tokens: one is a golden apple, the other, her Son, Jason.<br />Pregnant, and dismissed from her job, Sarah Jane joins a hand of railway navvies who are on the tramp looking for work. This is the age of the railway. All over the country track is being laid, tunnels drilled, and speculators are competing to make their fortunes. Her involvement in this world, first as a navvy wife, and later as a landowner, leads to a fated return to Chevington, and the rekindling of old loves. Meanwhile, the lessons of the years have taught Sarah Jane that her wish to be a lady was but a childish ambition; becoming a woman is what really counts.<br />Reflecting the energy and pioneering spirit of the 1850s, which it brings to glorious life, this powerful love story is illuminated throughout by the golden apple - a precious symbol of the human heart.	2000-11-05

There is a truly black villain, minor villains, and a wonderful character in Mrs. Potter who comes to their rescue.

I found I put it down at the end of each chapter to savour what had happened and stretch out  the pleasure of reading it.<br />This book is the sequel to \\"The Virtuous  Cyprian\\" which was certainly in print in July 2000 as a Mills &amp; Boon  Large Print.  If you get the chance read the other first as Nicola Cornick  develops some of the characters over the two books and I personally find  her characters to be one of her strong points.  I think Lady Polly does  stand up by itself if you can't get hold of the first book.<br />Set in  London, and Suffolk, the book touches on some of the social unrest that is  normally omitted from many regencies.  There is however much mention of  balls and other social occasions.  Also smugglers, at least one elopement,  secret staircases, gossip about whom is being pursued by a most unsuitable  man, blackmail, and a heroine's mother who is determined that her daughter  should be married at St. George's Hanover Square.<br />From the back cover of  the Mills &amp; Boon large print hardback edition....<br />Lady PolIy had  rejected Henry five years ago, obeying her father's wishes.

Although in the dedication she mentions having access to the collected works of Georgette Heyer and the OED this book you are quite aware that you  are not reading a rehashed Georgette Heyer.  The quality of writing is  exceptionally good, especially for a first novel, there is the same sense  of fun as some of the light hearted Georgette Heyers.  The characters and  conversations breathe life and are an essential part of the book.  The  Reverend Adolphus Ashton for example ?Truly inspirational, as usual,?  applauded Lady Lyttworth,??Thank the Lord! Thank your betters! Thank the  fourteen-hour workday! For they keep you from sin.?   <br />The Calista is  very much a true bluestocking.  I very much enjoyed the way that both Lord  Stanhope and Calista narrowly manage to avoid one matrimonial trap after  another.  Some well intentioned others not quite so well intentioned.

I would be tempted to give this book a 5star rating for the illustrations alone, but the price and the Italian text will probably deter many who would otherwise be interested in buying it. There is a growing interest  generally in the paintings of Bernado Bellotto, many are now being used in  extreme miniature as cover illustrations for CDs of music by composers  associated with the Dresden court. In contrast, Alberto Rizzi's book  contains one to a page colour reproductions of (I think)  49 of Bellotto's  beautifully detailed townscapes and landscapes with about 40 details in  colour, some full-page, all interesting in their own right.The 189 black  and white illustrations mostly cover Capriccios, sketches and engravings. A  small section at the end of the book containing engravings and photographs  gives a further idea about some of the places in the paintings and, in the  case of Dresden, of some of the damage caused by wartime bombing. For me,  this is one of the most fascinating Art books that has appeared over the  last few years.-SW	2000-06-26

The only difficulty is deciphering the differing titles. `Mrs Malory: Death among Friends' is actually the ninth book, it's english title being `Dead and Buried'. It would be interesting to know why the titles are changed. It would almost seem that american publishers think their readers are incapable of remembering author's names but expect a greater recall of a book's main character. Many of the original titles are derived from english literature but this wouldn't seem to a major drawback, British readers would not necessarily recognise the references. However the result, particularly the inclusion of `Mrs Malory' in each title, tends to suggest that the books resemble the many series of mysteries (many of them fun to read) by American authors who have a distinctly romantic idea of past and present life in Britain. I think this does the books an injustice. They are set in a relatively affluent area of England and most of the characters are fairly intelligent, very well educated people whose lives have mostly been reasonably comfortable (besides suffering bereavement and an incredible number of murders). However, Hazel Holt has an extremely good grasp of social interaction and a sympathetic approach to humanity, with a subtle sense of humour and a touch of cynicism that ensures the books are enjoyable but never unrealistic or sentimental.<br />Of the other titles available, `Mrs Malory Wonders Why ` was originally titled `Superfluous Death', `Mrs Malory, Detective in Residence' was originally `Murder on Campus' and `Mrs Malory and the Only Good Lawyer' was `The Only Good Lawyer...'

There are many subtle details about his policemen that add colour to the tale.   I find  some of the postmortem details a little gruesome, but enjoyed the mortuary  attendant's outlook on life.  The interrelated crimes in this book  gradually come into the open.

At one level you can play it as an exciting multi-user game with robbers robbing trains, trains blowing apart and ruthless AI opponents.  At another level you can read through the  book and understand much more about how the game was built and its  capabilities.  You can control the speed of play, I use the slowest speed  and even then I find it too fast when running over 300 trains in the UK at  the same time.  For me using the book, RailRoad Tycoon II Official strategy  guide and the game together meant learning about the map editor so I could  customise other people's maps and make my favourite map of England much  more accurate to play.  The game itself becomes much more interesting as  you deal with more levels of complexity.  You can even eliminate the AI  opponents and robbers.  Introduce new events and generally create your own  world.<br />The game shows its North American roots.  My background being  English is very different, nowhere in England is more than 50 miles from  the sea.  Fishing and ports are much more important.  My personal wish list  would be to add different types of ports and a fish cargo to the  game.<br />But to enjoy the game to the full you really need the Official  Strategy Guide.  Is it likely to have a harmful effect.  Don't know.  I  have spent many hours playing the game, I have even learnt a bit of  geography whilst playing it, I now know roughly where a few places like  Denver and Frankfurt are.  Also I can tell you exactly where the mountain  ranges that are going to slow down trains are as well.

Whether a book is enjoyable or not seems to depend on the balance between the  endearingly or interestingly eccentric, the irritating and the obnoxious. I  enjoyed `A Place of Safety' despite the presence of the forthright Cully,  who can dominate a book even if she's supposed to be nowhere in the  vicinity. (There seems to be a disproportionate number of fictional  detectives with actress wives or daughters. I don't know whether authors  use them in the interest of plot, as a way of introducing further elements  of drama or because they think there are characteristics common to both  professions.) I still find the author's use of product name-dropping  excessive, almost enough to justify the addition of explanatory notes  before the foreign and large print editions come out. The descriptions that  don't use this device often seem much more interesting and inventive.  It  is difficult to classify all the books as a whole. Even in the main series  different readers may find different books more or less congenial, but they  may find it worthwhile to read more than one book before they decide what  they do think of them.	2000-03-31

As always  Georette Heyer is accurate historically, I like the difference between what  is acceptable at a private dance and a public dance for example.  The  language used is correct, the minor characters are interesting in  themselves.  Laurence Calver for example definitely has my sympathy.<br />From  the dust cover of the Heinemann edition....<br />Old Joseph Calver's will is a  surprise to all his relations and a disappointment to most of them. Its  consequences also cause a great stir in the parish of Oversett in the West  Riding when the news arrives that Sir Waldo Hawkridge is coming north to  inspect his inheritance, the late Mr Calver's decaying residence, Broom  Hill. For Sir Waldo is the most discussed man in London Society, wealthy,  handsome, still a bachelor, the acknowledged leader of the Corinthian set,  and known as the Nonesuch for his athletic prowess.<br />At the Manor and the  Rectory, and particularly at Staples, the home of Mrs Underhill, where her  tempestuous, beautiful niece, Tiffany Wield, and her governess-companion,  Miss Ancilla Trent, are also living, there is excited anticipation of the  increase in social activity which the presence of the Nonesuch will bring.  The young men of the neighbourhood look forward to learning from him all  the latest refinements of dress and the most daring new tricks to be  performed with well-bred horses, while their elders express their doubts  about the expensive habits in which they expect the None-such to encourage  their wives and children. Both excitement and doubts increase when it is  heard that Sir Waldo is accompanied by his young cousin, LordLindeth.<br />Miss Heyer writes with her usual wit and grace of the commotion  which the arrival of the two fashionable strangers inspires, of Sir Waldo's  real intentions and of the unexpected train of events to which they lead.  The Nonesuch ranks amongst the most entertaining and accomplished of her  Regency romances.	2000-03-21

Many people feel she invented the Regency Romance.  The dialogue used is often from original sources, this book actually contains one of her very  few historical mistakes, Soho in Birmingham not Soho in London is where the  foundry was located.  There are misunderstandings but ones that seem to  occur quite naturally.   In this book Felix Fredrica's  schoolboy brother  with a scientific bent questions practically everything and is quite  central to the story.  The character descriptions and dialog are excellent  and all in all it is one of my favourite Georette Heyers.<br />From the dust  cover of the Bodley Head edition...<br />Written in Georgette Heyer's lightest  vein, this is the story of the adventures in Regency London of the  Merriville family: Frederica, riding the whirlwind and directing the storm;  Harry, rusticated from Oxford and embarking with enthusiasm on the more  perilous amusements pursued by young gentlemen of ton; the divine Charis,  too tender-hearted to discourage the advances of her numerous suitors;  Jessamy, destined for the Church and wavering, in adolescent style, between  excessive virtue and a natural exuberance of spirits; and Felix, a  schoolboy with a passion for scientific experiment. In Frederica, Georgette  Heyer created one of her most engaging heroines; and in the Marquis of  Alverstoke - a bored cynic who becomes involved in all the imbroglios of a  lively family -a hero whose sense of humour makes him an excellent foil for  Frederica.	2000-03-04

SHEILA BISHOP's No Hint of Scandal is one of  them.  The book is set in the country, the major characters are three  brothers, Richard, lord of the manor, and now a widower, Theo vicar of the  parish, and Verney the younger brother who has not been quite as  respectable as Louisa, Theo's wife might wish.  The plot twists back and  forth.  Even some interesting attempts at blackmail.<br />From the back of the  book....<br />No scandal has cast a shadow over the Capel family for at least  three generations. So when Verney Capel is forced to resign from his  regiment, his family are not very pleased - especially when he plays fast  and loose with the affections of Harriet Piper, a local heiress. Harriet  longs to be loved, but she is unable to compete with fascinating Julia  Johnson. There is some sort of mystery about Julia, but by the time it  begins to come out she has married into the Capel family, and what can be  done to stave off disaster? Harriet ventures into the fray and makes some  astonishing discoveries...	2000-02-24

I brought this book purely on the title, hoping it might be a Regency, it wasn't.  Julia Byrne has set this book in 1464, so things are a little more robust than later times.  For me it was readable but not as subtle as I  prefer.  I think if I quote a passage from the book you can get a flavour  of the tone and style of writing.  The hero is addressing the  heroine.<br />\\"If you want to live, my lady, he said very softly, `you'll shut  up and do exactly as I say. If I say we're leaving tonight, that's  precisely when we leave. If I say ride hard, you'll ride harder than you've  ever ridden in your cosseted, useless life. If I say walk, you'll walk. If  I say crawl on your hands and knees, you'll damn well crawl on your hands  mud knees. Do you understand me?' Nell was trembling by the time he'd  finished, but it wasn't in fear of Beaudene. At least, she didn't think it  was. His forceful insistence that they flee her family, his arrogant  confidence that he was right, shook her more than she cared to admit. What  if she was wrong? What if the slashed gown was the only piece of spite  Margaret had indulged in, and the other incidents real attempts on her  life?\\"<br />From the back of the book...<br />Lady Eleanor fitzWarren had barely  seen her father since he gave her into the `care' of her uncle's dissolute  household. Only by deceit and manipulation had Nell managed to hang on to  her virtue, so it ill became Lord Rafe Beaudene to think her a whore,  however things might have looked! Rafe might have been delegated to bring  her to her father, prior to any marriage fitzWarren might arrange, but Rafe  clearly had an agenda of his own. Was Nell simply to be a pawn between two  powerful men bent on revenge?	2000-02-20

Fashionable Bath is twenty  miles and a whole different world away.  I particularly liked the character  descriptions and the description of life in Bath.  The sedan chairmen  demanding higher than agreed fees when their clients were in no position to  resist.  As the plot unfolds Sarah finds not everyone behaves in the way  that she expects.  <br />To quote the write up on the back of the book  ....<br />Sarah Cooper comes to fashionable Bath in 1766 to act as companion to  delicate Cassie Fleetwood. Young and inexperienced, Sarah does not at first  understand the kind of people she encounters. She makes some disastrous  mistakes, and her honest determination to put things right leads to further  trouble. Sarah's adventures give a fascinating picture of what it must have  felt like to be a visitor in eighteenth century Bath.	2000-02-18

Major Hugo  Darracott is best described as a wolf in sheep's clothing with a wicked  sense of humour.  I personally enjoyed the Yorkshire dialect and the  descriptions of Hugo being taken in hand.<br />Georette Heyer wrote both  regencies and detective stories, if you haven't read the Regencies they are  worth reading.

It deals with  both Richard and his sister Penelope Rich, and deals with the last 5 years  of his life.  The tale is set in 1596 and I suspect a fair bit of work went  into the research.  I wondered about the word &quot;moppet&quot; since  Sheila Bishop's other books are usually accurate so looked it up, first  recorded use in the Oxford dictionary 1601 so spot on.

Mills&amp;Boon publish a number of their better selling authors in hardcover large print as well as paperback.<br />Many Harlequin Regency  romances are of excellent quality although Harlequin no longer publish a  separate Regency line.

By its self I'd  rate this one 5 stars.<br />The other story Azeala by Brenda Hiatt is  partially set in Williamsburg and partially in London.  Features an  American heroine and an English hero.  When I lived in London I noticed  that many Americans are fascinated by street markets, and they turn up in  this tale.

Lady Jersey even makes a short  appearance.  I found it very enjoyable, but will simply quote the back of  the book rather than give the plot away.<br />&quot;'I will have your  obedience!'<br />Since Rebecca Standish was twelve years old her best friend  Drum had tried to curb her wild ways.  When he'd left to join the army she  had been freed from his domination, but seven years later he was back!  He  was still as overbearing as ever - and very handsome!  She vowed to ignore  him, but that proved impossible when she was forced to stay at Rayne's  Park, Drum's residence.  She soon discovered that he had every right to  boss her around, but he had no right to let her fall in love - with  him!&quot;<br />If you like this author try Alice Chetwynd Ley, or Sarah  Westleigh.	1999-01-14

I liked the description of travel across the english channel.  I've had a couple of rough crossings myself and can relate.  The descriptions of life in Paris make a pleasant change from the settings of London.  I enjoyed the  characters of the Earl of Thurrock, Miss Louisa Finsham's maid Betty, the  groom Pershaw especially.	1999-01-11

A retired Major who eventually wins the bride of his  dreams, the young lord who is spending too much gambling and is lured away  from the hells of London, and not forgetting the dashingly dressed Lilly  who exists to tempt the hero from the straight and narrow.<br />This by the  way is one of the last Regency Romancy line published by Fawcett Crest,  perhaps if we buy enough copies they might relent and publish a few more.	1999-01-09

Her books have stood the test of time and these days can be found mainly in Ulverscroft large print editions.  This particular book,  set in 1812, explores the Luddite attempts to prevent the new shearing  frames being used and taking away men's work.  The book is interesting for  its use of accurate dialog &quot;you mark my words&quot;, &quot;What dost  say? Will it suit?&quot; which is often not found in American authors  writing in this period.  It's main characters are gentry rather than lords  and ladies, a mill owner and a governess.	1998-12-27

It gives historical background to the way life was in 1665 and from it you can see how life developed into the regency time period.  It happens to include  both the plague and the great fire of London.  An English author, I happen  to like the way all women are still referred to as Mistress.  Also you,  your, thee, thou and thy are treated interchangably at this time period.   An interesting book in its own right, interesting and accurate use of  language and a well researched history lesson in its own way.<br />If you like  this autor try Alice Chetwynd Ley as well.	1998-12-27

Portable voice wireless communication similar  to a cell phone implausible.  When I arrived at an electric kettle I decided this tale was one of sheer fantasy.  If you don't have a background in science you may enjoy this book.  Personally I prefer a little more accuracy in my reading.	1998-02-26
