US	50107242	R3F800YEOYON33	0316057851	14392564	Lifeguard	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A Comeback	Usually when I become bored with an author who I had on my must read list as long as James Patterson has been there, I am more than just reluctant to give more than one more chance. I have been thoroughly frustrated with the last three or four of Patterson's efforts and had not intended giving \\"Lifeguard\\" a chance, but my son who saw several Patterson books on the shelf at home was looking for a b-day present for dad, and that is how I came by this latest work. Guess what. It is damn good. Not great, but everything I had come to like about Patterson, interesting but flawed characters, speedy reads, and plots that actually make sense and entertain. I hesitate to say too much about the plot, etc., so I don't give away too much of the plot, but suffice to say he hits the same stride he had when he wrote \\"Kiss the Girls\\" and \\"Cradle and All\\"; a lot of surprises, but grounded in believable action and realistic endings. A sequel may even entice me at some point, but I reccommend \\"Lifeguard\\" to all Patterson's older fans who, like me had been put-off in the last several years, and not a bad place to start for new fans. The biggest criticism I can offer is the wide margins, short chapters that make the book appear thicker than it is when it is almost short enough to be called a novella, after all I read it in two sittings.	2005-09-10

So why has he re-written, or re-packaged another \\"World According to Garp\\"? The names of the characters have changed, the locations - mostly, but the plot is a rehash. Too bad because he is a great writer. Time I think he needs to move on to different plots, step out and take chances, he has the chops, why does he hesitate?

Kurt Austin (Dirk Pitt clone) is a ho-hum character, and the whole NUMA expeience has run out of steam. There are now three or four series that Cussler, with co-authors are pounding out at so rapid a pace I wonder if they actually care anymore about creating great adventures, or is making money the motive. The recent books all read like comic books, stilted, no characterization, no depth, no interesting plot twists and a whole lot of description that amounts to nothing but formulaic writing at its worst. Cussler has entered the world of the famous writer living off past success - like Tom Clancy. Novel factories is what you get. I am mad at myself that I gave him yet another chance and found myself reading the same book as his last Austin/Pitt efforts.	2005-09-06

Konrath's first foray into the serial character (\\"Whiskey Sour\\")was slightly more interesting and better plotted than \\"Bloddy Mary.\\" The writing is dotted with humor and witty observations, and Jack's parthner Herb serves as a clown who reminds me a little of Columbo - much smarter than he pretends, on purpose. The plot doesn't hold too many surprises and at times it could use more tension to drive the plot, but still it was worth the time. As a new writer, J. A. shows signs he is capable of improving with each new effort and that is what will make us mystery fans keep coming back. I'd like to see him leave this series for the next outing and do a stand alone book to showcase just how strong a writer he can be by getting into plots and characters that a series like this restricts, like knowing the main character will always win and be ready for the next case. I don't think I am predicting anything earth shattering by saying I think number 3 will far surpass the first two, and I wish him good luck, good fortune and a long satisfying career as a novelist.	2005-08-23

Michael Connelly is one of the best, but this time he falls a little short. The plot seems a bit too contrived, and the characters almost too predictable.

I know some reviews will pan it right away without a serious effort at reading and digesting it because they are so sure the Bush Administration knows what they are doing and any one who doesn't is a liar, that even an administration insider's opinions and experiences won't persuade them how badly the transformation of Iraq has been handled, but try to look beyond your stubborn ideological political pablum and think for yourself and you will at least begin to see all is not as they would have you believe. It has absolutely nothing to do with conservative vs liberals, but everything to do with what is right, moral and sane.	2005-06-18

An absolute must read for anyone who cares about anything, especially future generations! <br /> As a teacher, married to a teacher and someone who has had the misfortune to be encouraged to seek counseling for a medical problem, I know that what Sommers speaks of is right on the mark. Therapy groups are nothing but whinning fests for people who can't wait to show everyone how much their disease or affliction hurts. Boo-hoo. I call it \\"gang bang therapy\\", ten sessions for the price of ten done in an hour. We live in a society now that doesn't encourage self-motivation and self-reliance. We put bullseyes on the backs of teachers and wait, just daring them to say the wrong thing so we can sue them for destroying our kids frail psyche. Better parenting is where the healing should start. Let teachers teach and let our kids know that once you are released into the world, it is a cold cruel ruthless place and if you've been codled, your doomed. Face it, Sommers is telling you things you might not want to hear, but its time you listened up, or the next generation will be a mess of whinners, complainers blaming everything they do that goes wrong on someone, or something else. The sooner we let our kids know that they are responsible for their own lives, the better of society will be.	2005-04-30

Alone was particularly good, and I recommend it for pure entertainment. there are a few flaws, but nothing too outrageous, and the writing is very good (except some dialogue doesn't ring true) so I can overlook it.

Michael Savage doesn't know it yet but he is a closet liberal - at least for this diatribe. One thing I will never understand about self-professed \\"Dr.s\\", like Mr. Savage, or the hysterical self-proclaimed \\"professor\\" of advanced conservative studies at the Limbaugh Institute, an imaginary ego inflating that Rush indulges in each day, or the insane rantings of Ann Coulter is: Why are the titles of their books so mean-spirited and demeaning? <br />Nevertheless this was much more interesting than his last two efforts, perhaps because his hypocrisy shows through so much more clearly, and in his heart of hearts he is a liberal who hides behind the rightwing shill game because otherwise he'd never get on the radio. <br />I know Mr. Savage is ready to admit that most people, whether or not they profess to be Republicans or Democrats are almost overwhelmingly moderate in their political beliefs and only slightly right of center morally. The fanatics at both ends, the Limbaughs, Hannitys, Becks and rightwing wacky shills  represent the minority, just as the Hollywood elite, and Frankens balance the scales on the extreme left. Liberal is a state of mind open to change, willing to sacrifice for what is right, and conservatives are uptight, resistent to change and afraid to admit they really don't have all the answers. <br />Don't forget, after the last election, one or two percentage points could have easily turned red states blue, and maybe 4 or 5 percent change could have changed the blue to red. Perplexing, isn't it. Face it, all extemes are significantly burdened with mental disorders. Next time, Mike, a kinder title will win more friends.	2005-04-19

My bookselves are filled with more than fifty McBain and a dozen Evan Hunter books. He is one of the most prolific writers of the last half century, working in several genres and multiple series under his own name, Evan Hunter, and his more well known Ed McBain, so one might expect an occasional weak effort, but that is why he remains on the top of my list, he has never faltered, not once. His dialogue is deft, characters ring true and plotting is masterful. Can you ask for more in an entertaining read? Easily the equal of Elmore Leonard, Carl Hiaasen and George Pelecanos. Alice in Jeopardy is admittedly a little different, but that is why it is a five star, McBain doesn't wear a path through the same material, he always moves on to new and maybe better stuff. I hope he continues for another half century, and I will be looking forward to the next, McBain, or Hunter with equal anticipation,	2005-02-24

Anyone who read this before the last electin and still voted for Bush I would question your motives. There is no question some of what Bamford postulates is flawed, and I found at least half adozen factual errors or facts taken out of context, yet taken as a whole, the failure of the intelligence community, and the way the Bush White House manipulated the facts to attain the outcome they desired, should stand as a wake up call, as those facts are indisputable. We should now be on our guard and watch these guys even more closely, they are not acting in America's best interests, or the rest of the world, and in fact have made things much worse because of their unmitigated hubris.	2005-02-21

Those in the know have known for a long time that the real talent behind Tanenbaum's Butch Karp books has been Michael Gruber. Like many of the reviewers here I knew that Gruber had gone out on his own after a split with Tanenbaum, and like them I was willing to give the name on the cover a chance to prove his own talent. I'm sorry to say I was disappointed. From the first page it is abundantly clear that the style has suffered, and Butch Karp has hit the skids. The question is now, did Tanenbaum do any of the writing or plotting of the early Karp novels, or is he only a front man? The quick answer may indeed be, yes. <br /> <br />Butch and his vigilanty wife have slowly become annoying, cloying and just too predictable. It is time to put them away and explore new fields, \\"Hoax\\" has rung the death knell for a once interesting pair of characters and plots that made sense and writing that galluped with tension and drama. <br /> <br />\\"Hoax\\", as the title, is obviously a pun. The Karp series has been a gigantic \\"hoax\\" and now the truth is revealed. To be sure, do what I did and check out Michael Gruber's first novel with his name on the cover, \\"Trpic of Night\\", and you'll get the joke. Gruber was the masyermind, the talent - the \\"writer\\" all along. For the same kind of former great read just look for a different name on the cover and a new, more vibrant hero named, Paz. <br /> <br />Tanenbaum, Karp, etal are history and that is too bad we say good bye to an old friend and hello to a new, more interesting series by the true master, Michael Gruber.	2005-01-12

I nearly didn't write this review because I don't want to be negative about one of my \\"formerly\\" favorite mystery writers and one of my favorite characters, Alex Cross. All I keep thinking is, \\"What was James Patterson thinking.\\" <br /> <br />The book, at a cover price of $26 isn't unusual, except when you open it and look at the extra wide margins and larger than normal print - all that white space, and I think I'm being suckered. I'm used to the two or three page chapters, that has been Patterson's style for years, but the last few outings he has seemed to be trying to write too many books in too short a time and all he seems to have done is alienated many of his most loyal fans. I usually pass on his books to my kids and friends, but this one, which I read with disappointent in one night, I can't recommend with even faux sincerety. <br /> <br />The plot is weak, and almost pointless in its absurdities, and the filler parts with Nana Mama and his kids don't carry the same resonance they once did to show Cross' human side, his character strengths. His family seems relagated to subplots to make the main story seem like a novel and not a long short story - which it really is - and not that well plotted a story either. <br /> <br />Disappoint me once, and I can forgive, but Patterson's books have developed a pattern of disappointing over the last half dozen and sadly, because there are so many books, and so little time, I'm sorry, James Patterson is crossed of my must read list, my Amazon Wish List, and now will be only looked at during a period of bookstore browsing and most likely not purchased or borrowed from a library again. -------Unless there is a sudden and glorious, sincere ressurection ---but it will be a very hard sell next time.

I saw this on the library shelf and wondered why only \\"liberals\\" would be considered do-gooders, and that it is wrong to be either a \\"liberal\\" or a \\"do-gooder\\". However the title is misleading and the text is more thoughtful and the ideas presented are less volitle than the title would suggest. Most conservative \\"books\\" are nothing more than smear filled screeds intending to demonize, not only \\"liberals\\", but the word liberal itself as though a dictionary definition is superfluous - the worst offenders of course of meaningless right wing propaganda are Ann Coulter (the queen of neurotic \\"lib-phobia\\"), Hannity (who doen't feel his bizarre opinions need facts and logic to back them up because his \\"lib-phobia is incurable), and of course Rush Limbaugh (who pretends he is the dean and only professor of an imaginary course of study called \\"Advanced Conservative studies\\") a man who hasn't been right about anything of consequence yet. <br /> <br />So here is at least a reasonable thinking \\"conservative\\" view that seems well thought out, even if off track occasionally. The flaws, and there are a few, begin with the supposition that the things conservatives find fault with are all the fault of \\"liberals\\", or \\"liberal thinking\\". It is an all too common thread in rightwing conservative screeds that the word \\"liberal\\" applies to any thought, idea, action, or political stance that they deem \\"wrong\\". Few if any define \\"liberal thought\\", or what liberalism is by definition according to every dictioary of the English language. Rightwing conservativism is so locked into a world view that demonizing opposing views is the way to convince people they are right and all other thoughts are not only wrong, but evil, dangerous and destructive. In short, right wing conservatives are so fearful of rational, reasonable debate and disagreements that they can only rant and rave, attempt to silence all opposition and smear anyone who dares to question their secret motto, which is, and I know I ambreaking a sacred code mentioning this, but conservatives and their minions live by the creed: \\"Don't confuse me with facts, I've already been told what to think.\\" <br /> <br />Mona Charen is a little above the worse offenders in the divisive fray that conservatives need to promote at every opportunity. She is a very adept author, is at least occasionally reasonable and defies the conservative mantra of \\"if you can't blind them with brilliance, baffle them with bull---t.\\" In fact this is the first book by a shameless conservative that I would urge flaming \\"liberals\\" to read, if only to be reassured that all conservatives are not as evil as Halliburton, Cheney (Nixon White House Stooge), Rove, Wolfowitz, Rumsfeld (also a Nixon  White House Stooge),Delay and their unwitting dupe, Dubya. It is good for once to read an opposing view that doesn't recite the lockstep party line to the exclusion of all reason.	2005-01-06

I admit I don't understand some of the most venom filled reviews, and I wonder if they read the same book as I did or if they read it at all.  <br /> <br />I can agree that \\"Gold Coast\\" and \\"Up Country\\" are two examples of his best work, but \\"Night Fall\\" doesn't miss by much. I was wary as the plot unfolded that DeMille might make a huge faux pas and re-write history, and I suppose that because he didn't, and that the end was a bit more predictable than his usual fare some fans might feel disappointed. But beyond the set up ending I think there was more political wrangling than expected, and the main plot lacked a full and complete resolution that DeMille usually delivers. Therein lies its biggest fault. After thinking about it - I waited a week before writing this - he plotted the only ending that would make sense or could suspend the typical sense of belief fiction fans expect. <br /> <br />I hope I haven't given away too much, but I urge readers who pick up the book after reading this to pay more attention to the details, the characterization and the political plot manipulations as the story unfolds. It reads more as a \\"what if\\" scenario, than a \\"this really happened\\" con some less talented writers would have used. <br /> <br />DeMille remains at the top of my short list for thrillers/mysteries because he is not a book a year formulaic hack. He cares about his characters, the story and the reader and it shows. I can wait two or three years for the next book because I know it will not be more of the same, but a new experience, a fresh point of view and welcome surprises. That's what I like about genre fiction and that is what DeMille delivers, even when he stumbles a bit, he can be forgiven.	2005-01-06

Tom Wolfe has always been a bit over the top, but at his best with his peculiar brand of non-fiction. His two previous novels (Bonfires of the Vanities & A Man in Full) were pretty boring, something that is hard to do when the writing is so good. With \\"I am Charlotte Simmons\\" he seems completely out of it, so much so that the writing is pale, dull and foppish and the dialogue is laughable in its triteness. Either TW has lost his talent, phoned it in or is trying a new style that fails miserably. It appears as though his research, which was said to be extensive, was ignored or poorly done. He is out of touch with today's college scene, and so much so that if he had placed it in the sixties it might have done better as a spoof. My advice to TW is give up fiction and try another \\"Electric Kool Aid Acid Test\\" so we can see if the talent is still there or gone forever.	2004-12-29

Admittedly I wouldn't read Coulter without being bribed. Nor would I write a review trashing a book on the day it is published without having read it. I trade books with a friend who is an unrepentent conservative (who has recently decided to vote for Kerry or lose his sanity,)and he in turn has to read \\"America\\" by Jon Stewart & The Daily Show writers. <br />   That said I wasn't disappointed, Ann Coulter has collected some of her most vicious columns and published them just before the election as a ploy that she believes will sway voters. Unfortunately, from what I've heard it is backfiring. Coulter should get her facts straight first, but she relies instead on talking points approved by the far right and adheres to the mantra that anyone disagreeing is a \\"liberal\\". It might be a good idea if someone could explain to Coulter what a liberal is before she casts stones. Too often she takes things so far out of context they don't even make sense, and factual errors seem to be on almost every page. It isn't even so much that her writing is bland, poorly organized and self-serving as it is just plain funny thinking anyone actually believes it. <br />    This is satire, poor satire, misinformed satire, fictional satire and only humerous because it is difficult to understand how she continues to be published at all. Doesn't anyone check facts anymore, or is polititical animosity immune from accuracy? <br />	2004-10-13

The difference is that now Kurt Austin is nothing more than Dirk Pitt redone, and the storylines are well worn, the action has been done to death and the bad guys are cartoons. The writing moves along, but is uninspiring. Maybe a book a year is too short a deadline, and more time between books would help the authors to develop better plots and stronger action and characters who are not the same old stereotypes, or maybe Clive should go it alone again.

It took me three days to read this tomb, and even though I tried to find something positive, it isn't here. I doubt if the first reviewers even bothered to read it, they simply made preemptive attempts to make the book sound well done when it is anything but. I am also certain some one stars will react similarly. As much as I wanted to avoid reading it, to review it I decided I had to, and I will admit it was painful knowing people will sink so low in politics. I have no grat admiration for John Kerry, but there is absolutely no redeeming value in the current administration, so as Ralph Nader said himself: \\"Anyone but Bush.\\" <br />Too many books now days are blatantly partisan and play fast and loose with the truth, but the completely disingenuous and inaccurate \\"Unfit for Command...\\" is scandalously false in every way. Already many of the statements made in this book have been proven to be lies and distortions, so it makes the entire book completely lacking in integrity, and libelous in every way. That the sources and references were not vetted properly by the publisher is just another indication of the length the Bush Administration will go in creating subtrefuge, disinformation and fabrications in another bold attempt at stealing an election while claiming to have nothing to do with the Bush campaign. Such books are inherently evil in intent, dishonest in content and should not be published at all, but such is the nature of attack politics when you can't defend your own record or talk about real issues. If anyone believes this book to hold any truths they have been hoplessly brainwashed, and have no real concern for truth, America or anything but rightwing fanaticism. Should this book change anyone's mind about John Kerry then they haven't bothered to think for themselves. This is the worst political shame I have ever seen and just can't believe any honestly intelligent person would think otherwise. But the Bush cabal has made a habit of deceit and dishonesty to manipulate the electorate successfully, so why change evil tactics now.	2004-08-23

I normally read three or four books a week, but most are in the 250-400 page range, so this one took me a little longer. But the speed with which reveiws appeared makes me envious - so many speed readers who both loved and hated the book - although few of them said anything about the book and seemed only to refer to the event of publication, publicity and their personal political agendas so I got nothing from most of them.<BR>     Every autobiography I have ever read has been subjective and self-indulgent, and the longer the more boring. I am not surprised that President Clinton's book is so weighty, but unlike many I found most of it fairly interesting and much less dull than I anticipated. Like many of his supporters (I am an unabashed and unapologetic Democrat, so I too have my prejudices) I was disappointed by his personal behavior in the oval office, and I don't feel as though it my place to forgive him or not, so turning to the Monica passages was not a priority and it was more than 700 pages until he addressed that topic, and I find that okay.<BR>     Whether or not you like Bill Clinton you have to be honest with yourself about one thing: Most of use will not write an autobiography because, let's face it, no one would read it. Clinton's life was exceptional. His background and how he rose to such prominence is fundemental to his life story, and though detractors seem bent on only talking about Monica, that is not what I found most compelling. Bill Clinton worked hard, faced adversity, used his ambition and above average intelligence - let's face it a Rhodes Scholar is not a common accomplishment and I don't know of another president who achieved that honor - and against considerable odds succeeded, sometimes by the sheer force of will.<BR>    Still a young man when he left office he still has the opportunity to do more, and he talks about that with enthusiasm and it will be interesting to see what more he accomplishes.<BR>    One interesting incident that has so far been overlooked in the publicity romp and reflects on 9/11 was the increase in FBI's budget (1996)that he approved with the caveat that it be used to significantly improve communication and information sharing with the rest of the Governments alphabet soup, CIA, NEA, DEA, etc., and it wasn't done. In light of what happened the failures of the intelligence community is magnified. Why is that not a significant incident? To me it should be addressed more completely, and Monica should and is, much less important.<BR>     Being familiar with his speeches and previous writing I was also impressed that this book was written completely by the former president and not just another ghosted or \\"as told to\\" fluff job. The language, grammar and sentence structure show this very clearly, and he deserves an extra star for writing his own story in his own way, subjectivity and self-indulgences and all.	2004-06-26

Burstein writes an interesting companion to &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot;, but seems to forget one thing: IT IS A NOVEL - FICTION. This fasination with the genre is silly, really! It is not meant to be anything but escapism reading. This isn't the only book, article, etc. that are trying to cash in on Dan Brown's success, but come on people, you're taking all this way, way. way too seriously. Writers of fiction almost always take literary license, and looking for loopholes, errors and historical mistakes takes any entertainment value away from it. This book is almost as long as the novel - now seriously..... I'm glad I didn't buy this book (A friend at a bookstore let me borrow it for the weekend), and I'm sorry to say that after fifty pages I skimmed mercilessly, but was amused occasionally, and thankfully Burstein has a knack for making boring nonesense readable if not of any real value - besides his, and his publisher's profits that is..............	2004-06-06

Bush's America	Books	4	56	66	N	N	I must be a liberal	I don't know of anyone who is completely liberal, or completely conservative, and the same goes for Republican or Democrat - except perhaps the ideologues who still support Bush. I admit I started reading this last fall, but never finished until yesterday when I found a paperback copy left on the coffee table by my daughter, who will vote in her first presidential election this year. When I asked what she thought of the book she said: &quot;I just can't understand how someone who was a failure at everything he tried could become president - or even be nominated.&quot; I guess that says it all, something is very wrong with the political system, or perhaps 2000 was just a freak of nature, a failure of logic, or an uninterested electorate.<BR>The writing is not compelling, but the information makes up for any shortcomings. Of course one would have to be hoplessly naive to believe every word, but the evidence is already substantially out there and &quot;Bushwacked&quot; has just consolidated much of it in one place.<BR>If everyone who really cares about the direction these ideologues have taken us in the last few years reads this book, then George Bush will be in Crawford, Texas by January 2005, and not on one of his innumerable &quot;vacations&quot;.One can only hope that there is a larger than normal voter turnout in November, that alone would cause a Democratic landslide. As a matter of policy the Republicans depend on low turnout to have a chance at victory.	2004-06-05

First, those one star reviews tell nothing about the book, and are only intended as personal assaults on Tim Russert as an interviewer on Meet The Press. makes me wonder if they even picked the book up, never mind read it.<BR>  That said, I found it to be a celebration of a man whose son is justifiably proud of him. Those of us whose fathers (and mothers) grew up in the depression and survived World War II understand and and admire that generation beyond words. Sometimes the writing is a little sappy, but who among us doesn't get sentimental about parents they loved and admired. Maybe I'm an easy sell because I see so much of my own father (he passed away in 1996), and maybe it is also because my son  and I have a close relationship, and love and respect for each other unconditionally.<BR>  If you weren't as fortunate as Tim Russert and his father it might be difficult to relate to these feelings, but there is more, much more than that here, and whether or not you like Tim Russert personally, you have to admire his willingness to put himself out there knowing that some people will use it as an opportunity to take a swipe based not on the book but a polititical agenda.<BR>  How many of us get the chance to send such an amazing, loving tribute to our fathers, a public thank you for all he has done without ever expecting anything in return?<BR>  Thank you Tim.	2004-05-29

For those of us who were there to witness these great shifts in the world and America, who saw the tragedy of murdered heroes, a war no one understood and the divisive political atmosphere that permeated almost every day, 1968 serves as a reminder that everything old is new again. As a college student at the time the world seemed like it was exploding every evening on the news, and the future looked grim. We were the children of &quot;The greatest generation&quot; and the world our parents helped save for us didn't seem to be living up to its promise, Camelot was a pipedream.<br />Reflecting on many of those events it is easy to see how they compare with today, especially the similarities of the Vietnam War and the war in Iraq. Both were politically motivated by corporate power mongers, and seem to serve no purpose other than to enrich a few. The gross inequities of the draft - the day after I graduated from a state university my draft notice was delivered, and dozens of my friends suffered the same fate, yet not a single graduate of Harvard, Yale or Princeton was ever drafted into the Vietnam war - unlike John Kerry who enlisted, they used money, political favors and connections only open to the &quot;favorite sons&quot; - like Bush, Cheney and Rove - were unjust, unfair and discriminatory to the extreme. The hard lessons of that time are lost on those very same &quot;favorite sons&quot; who still extoll the extremism of a right wing sense of entitlement.<br />Kurlansky admits he is subjective, but it was difficult to live through those horrific events and not become jaded, and subjective. Du Pont in 1968 and Hilliburton in 2004 is the biggest example of the failure of our leader to understand the lessons of history, and Kurlansky is right to put it out there for others, too young to have witnessesed it to gain at least some understanding of their parents' experiences and current world views.<br />This is not great writing or even great history, it is best viewed as a window into a year when almost everything changed, and not always for the better. This should be required reading for every member of the Bush administration and anyone who thinks that history does not repeat itself - but of course we know Dubya doesn't read, so maybe Laura can read it to him - and soon.	2004-05-20

There are passages that resonate, but for the most part he could have told his story with fewer attempts at trying to impress us with his superior education. I have the feeling that Conlon considers himself superior to the average cop, and it shows, glaringly at times. His story is not above and beyond the grittier fare about life on the streets, merely a slightly different view. Where books like Serpico overdramatize real events, Conlon tries the reverse and presents a ho hum attitude. Let's face it, cops seldom get the respect they deserve, and that is unfortunate especially in the post 9/11 climate, but Conlon fails in his effort to raise our awarness by not providing any new insights or &quot;factually accurate&quot; heroic incidents. Half as long - less than 300 pages - would have been more dramatic, more relevant and just plain better. Less self praise and more about his fellow officers would have added greatly to the effort. Still, if you have the time, you could do worse than give this a try.	2004-04-21

That said this is, like the first in the proposed trilogy, terribly overwritten. Half as long and it would have been a much better reading experience. Stephenson digress to the point of becoming annoying. Much of these digressions are completely irrelevant. Part Sci-fi, part mystery, part historical - the author seemed unable to make up his mind and that ruined the experience. Bigger is just not better in this case, in fact it is to the detriment of the work. Better, more thorough editing is needed. Stephenson is trying too hard to impress with his ability to write, and write, and write - but the result is a lot of words, but not nearly enough substance. Plotting is all over the place, the characters are cardboard and pedestrian, and trying to pretend his characters are better prognosticators of future technological developments than Nostradamus is just too much to accept.	2004-04-20

The plot just doesn't inspire much tension or danger. The characters seem even less invested than the reader is led to believe. I got the feeling that Woods couldn't decide which series to write this time out, so he gave in to a misguided idea to give his fans a twofer. Setting up a new job for Holly Barker seems to be the most significant plot point, and even that isn't decided for certain by the end. Stone was simply a tool for Holly's &quot;reckless abandon&quot;, also an effort that seemed less than imperative and more just a gimmick to get her to New York. As I read I kept expecting some huge revelation that would tie everything together, but in the end there are more unanswered questions than answered.	2004-04-19

Cobain was a narsasistic, untalented drug addict who lived life evryday as though he wanted to die. Suicide is not that hard to believe. That said, there are some interesting points made here, but overall nothing concrete or overwhelmingly convincing. Could it have been murder? Possible, but not likely. Selling books is the point here, and to do so the authors have to go out on a limb, even if only to raise unanswerable questions with very little fact. Well written, but highly suspect.	2004-04-13

Phillip Margolin has been on my &quot;must read&quot; list for a half dozen years, and &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; will keep him there a bit longer.<BR>  The characters and the story move along at the usual pace, but the plot seems to develope holes and never quite satisfies in the end.

That is not to say you shouldn't read this latest attempt, it deserves the attention, and I'm sure all writers stumble occasionally, so I suggest you read it, enjoy it for what it does deliver and know that the next Margolin will most likely be racheted up a few notches.<BR>  To me Phillip Margolin is still in a league with Lehane, Stephen White, Steve Martini, The Kellermans, and about a dozen others who keep me up late at night.	2004-04-04

John Dean, many will say, is a former jail bird and can't be trusted or believed. So read this with a grain of salt, less than 200 pages shouldn't take you long. Much of what Dean says has the undeniable ring of truth, yet staunch, unshakable Bush supporters have been so brainwashed by the ideology of the radical right they will not take the time to even consider another view. Bush IS the most incompetent president in our history, many of us &quot;traitorous, commie liberals&quot; have been drawing the same conclusions for three years. It isn't a mystery. Never has been. The Bush cabal has been painfully obvious all along, and yet many can't see the similarities between now and 1972. It is not made up. Dean just asembled historical facts, placed them in context, and the conclusion is irrefutable. Bush and his puppetmasters should be impeached! But that won't happen, and election (Notice I don't say, &quot;re-election&quot;)is all too likely. The &quot;conservatives&quot; have been spending enormous amounts of time and money demonizing the word &quot;liberal&quot; and hyping the myth of a &quot;liberal media&quot;, and unfortunately easily manipulated voters who won't read beyond the headlines will be their biggest supporters. Stealing another election, since it was so easy in 2000, probably is also in the plans for November. Diebold has provided the computerized voting machines that can be manipulated and leave no paper trail to verify results, and they are also one of the Bush campaign's biggest contributors. If you are not outraged and concerned about the survival of our democracy by now, you are asleep at the wheel.	2004-04-03

Joe Kurtz, ex PI, ex con is one of the most interesting antiheros currently being written about. Simmons blends the atmosphere and mood of western New York into a modern noir canvas, and Kurtz and his former lover Rigby inhabit that world in a gray area of law and order that is both disturbing and realistic. Even after getting shot in the head, Kurtz displays the almost herculean toughness that would make Spenser wince - hence the title. The plot moves from place to place with a randomness that seems incongruous, but ultimately is very satisfying in the end. One of the best mystery/detective novelists working today. I highly reccommend going to Simmon's back list and catching up with the rest of his fans. He seldom has disappointed.	2004-03-25

There are some good points made here, and the writing for once is better than usual for a rightwing nut who sees everyone who disagees as a &quot;liberal&quot;. The facts are distorted whenever Hannity displays the vitriol and venom against Democrats, only because he, as many right wingers can't seem to admit, that Bush is a complete incompetent and has badly botched his job in just about every respect. If that opinion makes me a &quot;liberal&quot; I guess that is what I am, and thankfully proud of it. It is just too disingenuous to align terrorists and despots in the same category as &quot;liberals&quot;, democrats, or leftwingers. It is becoming harder and harder to listen to Hannity, Rush, etal when they continue to lie, misrepresent, take out of context and try to demonize anyone with a differing opinion, and then express an incomprehensible support for an administration that is so openly self-indulgent, self-centered and unwilling to even listen to alternative ideas. As a political independent, I find the &quot;don't confuse me with the facts, I've already made up my mind&quot; attitude not only unreasonable, but downright evil. As one of my students said recently, &quot;Bush is all about: if you can't blind 'em with brilliance, baffle 'em with BS, and call 'em all liberals.&quot; Face it, this book only further proves that Sean Hannity just doesn't have a clue what is really going on, and neither do his supporters.	2004-02-28

Sad to say, though many of the &quot;Cussler&quot; gimmicks are still included, they seem weak, over done and flat in the overall plot this time.

Dirk (Sr.) is getting long in the tooth and would be better served if replaced permenantly with Kurt Austin ( a doppleganger to be sure, but hey, no insufferable offspring yet.). Maybe Clive is stretching himself too thin these days, maybe his flare for exciting thrillers is running dry. Whatever it is, I hope this is only a blip, and if he needs three or four years between books to get back in top form, I'm willing to wait before crossing him off my must read list - after all, so many books, so little time!	2004-01-12

As the saying goes: &quot;the truth hurts.&quot; Of course at times Moore beats the dead horse, but what I found interesting is that he seems to have mellowed a bit from his previous books, and if his critcs actually gave it a thorough reading they would find that he supports a number of conservative ideas, and that he is not &quot;just another liberal&quot;, but rather someone who isn't afraid to ask the hard questions.<BR>    Overall I liked what he had to say while not agreeing with everything, especially his take on the unattainability of the American Dream, but here again he IS entitled to his opinion.<BR>     Before I finished reading the book I happened to be listening to Clear Channel radio one morning and heard Glenn Beck pleading with listeners not to read this book. His diatribe sounded almost panicky, as though he was terrified that a plague had been let loose on the planet, until I realized that his book, &quot;The Real America&quot; was released at about the same time and Moore's book was.... well kicking his book's butt. I can't say that I have ever heard a more obvious expression of professional jealousy over book sales and the apparent paranoid need to have his (Beck's) book reach bestsellerdom. My question would then be: What are ideological conservatives so afraid of? That people might start thinking for themselves?<BR>    I recommend this book, but I also recommend &quot;The Real America&quot;. Moore is a more polished author, but Beck has a few good things to say about family, morality and patriotism too, and that is why we have freedom of speech, so all sides have the opportunity to be heard.	2003-10-18

It reads like it was written over a long weekend. Why so many reviews mention Bobo is odd, since Bobo isn't mentioned in the book. Get over it people, it was just a cheap publicity stunt to sell books that got the results Glenn wanted - along with an incredible amount of incomprehensible PETA fury. Too bad he had to come up with that feeble &quot;lesson&quot; at the last minute to try to justify it.<BR>    Nevertheless there is nothing un-Beck like here. Anyone who has listened to his talk show has heard it before. Unlike Rush, Hannity, and Savage, Glenn isn't weighed down by the far rightwing ideology that makes the other yappers sound so stupid, he actually makes sense, especially when he discusses moral issues. Though I still can't understand his continual admiration of the Bush cabal - I think he will eventually see what a bunch of insane hypocrites they are and just how incompetent GWB is - but I still understand what he hopes for America and the future of our country, and I couldn't agree more, we just disagree on how to get there.<BR>     To those idiots who reviewed this book and criticized his &quot;fifties&quot; view of what family should be, too bad you weren't really paying attention to the message, which is that today we are moving in a direction that no longer has any respect for the kind of family life that was the backbone of how this country became the most amazingly wonderful place to grow up in. Love, then marriage, then children is still, and always has been the best enviornment to raise and teach children to be good, moral and decent people. Sometimes, oddly, change is not always progress. Think about it!	2003-10-06

Al Franken is a funny guy, and we all know that humor, especially effective humor has more than a little truth. But this battle between Liberals and Conservatives is bizarre. I truthfully don't know, nor do I care, if I am a liberal or a conservative, or a mutt, all I know is that though I don't agree with everything here, I was immensley entertained and I think that was a huge part of the author's intention. A book, a single book, isn't going to convert a nation unless it is populated by morons, and anyone who is fanatically biased as a Conservative or Liberal could quite possibly also be a moron.

The battle is joined, and take that Ann Coulter. Of course the right wing fanatics will not read this because they live by the adage: \\"Don't confuse me with the facts, I've already made up my mind.\\"<br />  Conason occasionally overstates the case, but his conclusions are right on. Even as the right wing is attempting to steal another election (re-election) in California, and the Bush leaguers seem to have been caught in yet another lie (EPA reports ordered changed concerning 9/11 ground zero health risks)the right wing will continue to do its fancy footwork. Had the Clinton administration tried even one lie as horrifying as Bush's book of lies, impeachment would be well on they way through Congress, but when your team controls the game, you can cheat with impunity.<br />  The debate after this book is out there for a while longer will probably be loud and devisive, but hopefully it will convince more people to visit the polls in 2004 - something the Republicans discourage with enthusiasm.	2003-08-23

I don't agree with everything the authors say here, but it would take someone who lived on a desert island for the 8 years of the Clinton administration, not to recognize how on the mark most of it is. The right still poo poos the theory of a \\"vast right wing conspiracy\\" but the evidence is irrefutable, and it continues with the constant restating of the myth of a liberal media, when here too the evidence is contradictory.<br />When the special counsel couldn't find a single law either President Clinton or his wife broke, and couldn't coerce witnesses to lie, they came up with a plan even the dumbest lawyer would know could work. It was simple: Get the President under oath, and then ask him about the one thing that virtually every man and woman woulds likely lie about if it was too personal - sex. Then charge perjury, beat it like a dead horse, manipulate the Constitution and Congress and offer up an impeachment sham of a proceeding that was never meant to work, but that would stay in the headlines ad nauseum. Then have every radio wacho on Clear Channel (the network that bans liberal points of view) proclaim how evil liberals are, and beat that like a dead horse too. The truth to the right wing is not only irrelevant, it is not to be spoken, under any circumstances.<br />It didn't work - but it did too - because it allowed the Republicans to steal the 2000 election, install a puppet president and sit back and ride the gravy train as long as possible, at all costs, and why: Because payback is a b--, well you know.<br />Limbaugh and his dirty minded ilk started denegrating Bill Clinton even before he took office, promoted every accusation as gospel, and ignored all the good his administration did. After all, with their candidate they could unravel it all and then blame Bill Clinton - even though he's not in office - the democrats, even though they control neither house of congress - and Hillary Clinton because they have more lies and venom to spread than they can control.<br />Of course no conservatives will read this because it is too close to the truth, and like I said, the truth is the last thing the conservatives want - they are more interested in the prurient lives of anyone who has a better idea.	2003-07-07

If this was not a &quot;first novel&quot; I might say it is a three, maybe four star mystery/thriller. But as first efforts go, this is amazing. The writing is tight, the plot as complex as more experienced masters of the craft, and the setting is refreshing, if a bit over written at times. The characters are familiar, yet drawn with an astute observer's eye. If there is a major flaw it is the dialogue which at times just doesn't ring quit true, though it does work in moving the story along.<br />It is always exciting to discover a new writer, and I look forward to Burdett's next effort, and will no doubt add him to my list of &quot;must read&quot; if he lives up to the promise of this first effort.	2003-07-03

After 270 pages I gave up. The writing was adequete but pedestrian and full of tired rhetoric of the right, and it became tedious. I wanted to be persuaded, to be convinced, but Ann Coulter's logic is seriously flawed. There is nothing here but more shilling for the \\"radical right wing wackos\\". There are no reasonable arguments, \\"liberal' is defined as anyone, or anything that disagrees with Ann's obsessive defense of the indefensible. I wish just once that an admitted conservative would define what he or she believes a liberal is, or should be. Pandering so blindly the the fifty year conspiracy of the right to abolish the Constitution and Bill of Rights, curb free speech and the right to a \\"redress of grievances\\", and grant a royalty of entitlement for the rich, corrupt, and greedy, as well corporate hounds, is not patriotic, that is treason. G. W. Bush and his confederacy of dunces are even more scary than Nixon and his black bag boys - they think they are patriots, and the flag belongs to only them, and Ann is helping spread the myth of a liberal press just to appease the monster, and it gets scarier and scarier with every move the right makes. Ann, can't see the forest for the trees, and the traitors are those she admires. SCARY! If I could have given no stars I would have, but so be it.	2003-06-30

There is nothing more thrilling for an avid reader than finding a new author to stoke the fires, and keep me up all night. John Ridley's writing is sparse, clean and vivid. Though I avoid most sci fi, this novel blends both mystery, thriller, police procedural and sci fi in the noir tradition. I see the influence of Raymond Chandler and the inagination of Philip Dick with the contempoary flair of Pelecanos.<BR>   This is a great concept deftly written and imaginative, dark and moody, but immensely satisfying.

Yet it is still a good read, and Hannity is an excellent writer and sharp observer, and most of the time his observations seem reasonable, except when insisting &quot;liberal bad&quot; (anyone who disagrees with his hoplessly naive admiration of the Bush administration), and &quot;conservative good&quot; (all those who are blind to the blatant hypocrisy of the Bush cabal.) Unfortunately for Hannity, who I find much more intelligent and interesting to listen to than than Rush &quot;I haven't gotten anything right yet, but if I bash democrats enough no one will notice&quot; Limbaugh, or Glenn &quot;I love war&quot; Beck, recent events have only highlighted the uncountable deceits of the Confederacy of Dunces (The Bush cabal, led by Karl Rove, Cheney and the puppeteers pulling the strings.). If the right would stop labelling the &quot;media&quot; left and liberal (If you say it enough, enough people who don't think for themselves will start to believe), and admit the real truth, that most media is hopelessly Right winged, Republican and lackeys, Hannity's thesis might begin to sound reasonable.	2003-04-30

The writing is so clear, and easy to read, the story so engrosing you forget that this is a true story, and an important history lesson. It is a character study, an adventure, a love story and an exploration into the very soul of one of the most over looked and under appreciated founding fathers. I enjoyed this read so much I reccommend it to everyone who desires an unforgettable experience. You will wonder, as I do, why we have not recognized such an important historical figure with a granite memorial in Washington DC on a par with the Washington Monument, Jefferson or Lincoln Memorials, for surely John Adams' contribution was no less profound or significant than those of any of his contemoraries. I would proudly support replacing at least one of the subjects on our old, out dated coinage or currency with his image, and keep it there for the next hundred years. Wow, wow, wow.	2001-08-31
