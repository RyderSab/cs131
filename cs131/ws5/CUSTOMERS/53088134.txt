Ever since, I've eagerly looked forward to every volume, for weeks or months ahead of publication.  Once received, each yielded a couple of weeks of daily reading treat.  I admit, since I dislike horror, I've always wished that the horror had been spun off into a separate volume.  Still, Ellen Datlow's taste in horror is pretty sophisticated, some of it being closer to dark fantasy, which I do like.  I always read the horror last.  But Terri Windling's fantasy selection more than made up for the horror content of the volume.  All those stories culled from \\"literary\\" magazines I never read (as being too modern and New-Yorky) for my taste.  And her roundups/brief reviews of new fantasy books!  I've discovered so many \\"mainstream\\" books and authors not marketed as fantasy from Windling's reviews.  Since the inception of Amazon, every roundup had me rushing to put at least ten more books in my shopping cart. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this is probably the last annual volume I'll ever buy.  The new team editing the fantasy content, Kelly Link and Gavin Grant, just are not up to Windling's standards.  First, in both the story selection and the roundups, it seems that they did not read nearly as wide a range of sources as Windling did. Second, their selections were lackluster.  The stories I really liked I'd already read in major fantasy magazines. The others were . . . sort of all right.  Mildly interesting.  But not worth that many pages.  I discovered one book worth buying in the review roundups, which were also lackluster.   <br /> <br />All in all, the uninteresting fantasy combined with that much horror, meant that the two weeks' delight I'd experienced for so many years, turned into a month-long slog, with me frequently counting stories (I don't read them in order) to see if I was finally almost done with the thing yet. <br /> <br/>Let's hope there's another change of editors soon.  And maybe, just maybe, they'll put the horror in a separate anthology, where it belongs.	2005-09-14
US	53088134	R5H14ZTA57FAX	0812080386	588544275	Pronounce It Perfectly in French	Books	4	19	19	N	N	Good but they could easily have made it better	I bought \\"Pronounce it Perfectly\\" because I am teaching myself French from the Foreign Service Institute tapes series (which this is not part of).  The FSI course is very good, but is mostly given at conversational speed, which means I repeatedly miss some nuances of pronunciation.<br /><br />So, I hoped \\"Pronounce it Perfectly\\" would teach me what I needed and keep me from permanently hardening a bad accent.  Tape I was great.  However, throughout Tape 2, the speakers apparently realized they were running out of room.  To make this minicourse fit onto the tape, they cut down the response time to almost nothing. I could barely draw breath before they were on to the next word.  I found myself gabbling all my responses anyhow just to get through them before I had to listen to another word.  True, I could press the Pause button, but doing that literally every few seconds gets old.  As for the long phrases and minidialogs, there was no possibility of repeating them, so I had to just skip them.  My accent, I'm afraid, did not improve much during the second half of the course--though I repeated it twice.<br /><br />This is a shame, because \\"Pronounce it Perfectly\\" would easily have fit onto two cassettes if they had not continually repeated the same few sentences about procedure (\\"Repeat the words after the speaker,\\" etc.) and cut the recordings of waltzes inserted between every unit.<br /><br />As for flaws in the course itself--being thoroughly stumped by the French \\"R,\\" I was disappointed to see it covered so scantily in \\"Pronounce it Perfectly.\\"  The course states there are three pronunciations for the French \\"R,\\" but that the only one covered would be the Parisian pronunciation \\"as recorded by the speakers on this tape.\\"  However, the male and female speakers pronounced the \\"R\\" quite differently.  And I would have liked to learn all three pronunciations.<br /><br />Finally--feeling that the difference between French spelling and pronunciation is a mystery worthy of Hercule Poirot--I'd reallly have liked more explanation as to when the endings of words, as spelled, are left off when pronounced.orthy of Hercule Poirot--I'd reallly have liked more explanation as to when the endings of words, as spelled, are left off when pronounced.	2005-05-27

And the only way I've been able to do it is to avoid hairdressers entirely.  No matter how strongly you tell any of them that you just want a tiny trim, no matter how sincerely they promise to cut \\"just an inch,\\" sheaves of hair wind up on the salon floor. <br /> <br />However, my hair didn't grow 100% evenly.  After five years the ends were looking pretty ragged.  But I was afraid to go to a hairdresser for fear of having five years of hair growing undone.  Furthermore, my hair had been in an oval cut and I wanted one straight across.  But, without losing a significant amount of hair.  (I did a consultation with a local hairdresser who wanted to level my hair to the length of my ex-bangs, which are at least eight inches shorter than any of the rest of my hair, and which would have given me a short cut all around.)  <br /> <br />So I finally decided to take matters into my own hands. I bought a copy of _Haircutting for Dummies._  I read the relevant sections, which turned out to be only the ones on buying tools (most of which I had), a few basic rules, and then info on the one haircut I wanted.  I marked these sections for my husband, and he spent about twenty minutes reading them.  Then we spent twenty minutes cutting my hair--which included setting up a chair and a mirror in the bathroom. <br /> <br />Even though my husband had never cut hair before in his life (nor have I) I emerged with a great cut and surprisingly little hair gone. <br /> <br />If you are in my situation, I could not recommend this book more highly. <br /> <br />	2005-05-08

I was struck by how well Ms. Clarke reproduces the period's literary style. And by how well she understands its social culture and the personalities that culture developed. There's real depth here--she's not just throwing in a few period spellings for faux atmosphere.  And then she adds the twist of a truly otherworldly magic.   <br /> <br />The book completely engrossed me all the way through. I think that some people who complained about the length don't understand the tradition Clarke is working in, which is that of the  18th-century picaresque novel.  Such novels are long.  They are driven by the different adventures the characters have, not solely by one plot whose end goal must be reached as efficiently as possible.  That's a modern concept, and it's not poor writing to adhere to an earlier literary model.  Clarke's footnotes are short stories in themselves and perfectly delightful.  <br /> <br />I've heard another volume is on the way. I hope it's just as long--but I also hope Clarke writes it faster than the first novel. <br /> <br />	2004-12-01

Although the main characters are college students, I'd say the target audience is high school students, or possibly junior high. Faris Nallaneen, underage Duchess of Glazon and student at Greenlaw College, is the character readers are supposed to identify with. She's too tall, awkward, lacking in social graces, and only a so-so student. The movement of the book is that Faris eventually finds her place in the world as an adult, and (since this is a fantasy novel) discovers she has great magic powers previously unknown to her. Faris also overcomes her rival (and distant relative) Menary Paganell. In a nonfantasy Menary would be the head cheerleader-shallow, childish, vain, totally self-centered, and sexually aggressive. Jane Brailsford is another student more successful than Faris-sensible, self-confident, cool-headed, and completely knowledgeable about worldly matters like clothes. However, Jane befriends and educates Faris.<br /><br />Faris begins the book in considerable conflict with her Uncle Brinker, Regent of Glazon. Faris suspects Brinker doesn't want to vacate the throne on her majority. After considerable confusion and drama, Faris learns the common YA lesson that relatives aren't as evil as teenagers think. True, Brinker is dishonest and intentionally irritating-but their relationship is resolved after a fashion. On a more cosmic scale, Faris is assigned to use her magic powers to heal something vague called \\"the rift\\" in the city of Avaris, capital of the Pagenells' kingdom. This is closely paralleled by healing rifts in political and family relationships-the Nallaneens and Pagenells quarreled over sovereignty issues in a previous generation.<br /><br />The book's extreme wholesomeness is also very YA. There is no sex more intimate than a kiss (and only a couple of kisses). (Admittedly the book is set in an alternate Edwardian world, and Edwardian noblewomen weren't supposed to have premarital sex.) The value of responsibility is often stressed. Faris is even held up by a highwayman who turns out to be a former childhood playmate. This gives the author the opportunity of explaining that a ruler who imposes taxes that subjects can't possibly pay, drives them to crime.<br /><br />In the end conditions are set up for Faris to finally marry the man she loves-and she doesn't. No believable reason is given. I suspect the author wanted to keep her options open for a sequel about Faris . (_Scholar of Magics_ is not it, the connections are only peripheral.)e premarital sex.)

US	53088134	R3H8EYCU34RBYT	0553380796	568801610	Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman	Books	4	27	32	N	Y	Not the Canticle, but still good	_Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman_ has a core story that is just as powerful as any in _A Canticle for Leibowitz_:  that of the monk Blacktooth St. George's spiritual journey.  Blacktooth first came to the monastary as a teenager, leaving his tribe of settled nomads in an attempt to join the wild nomads.  After the wild nomads rejected him he went to the monastary of Saint Leibowitz (which was obliged to give hospitality to travelers) and stayed.  When the book opens he's a young man with spiritual leanings, but with problems conforming to organizational life and a personality conflict with his abbot.  He asks the abbot to release him from his vows; the abbot refuses.  This refusal is echoed by several other superiors throughout the book, people who see that Blacktooth is actually cut out for the spiritual life even if he doesn't understand it yet himself.<br /><br />What Blacktooth really needs is enough experience to knowingly choose between the spiritual life and the wordly one.  And in this book he gets it.  Serving Cardinal Brownpony gives him a good look at both church and worldly politics.  He sees preparations for war, then the battlefield, and is even forced to kill.  He travels what is by his culture's standards a large geographic area.  He sees different customs, and even visits his distant cousins among the wild nomads.  He falls in mutual lust with a beautiful mutant woman named Aedria, and may even become a father of twins by her.  On the spiritual side, he receives wise Zenlike counsel from the holy hermit (and Pope) Amen Specklebird.  Both Amen and Blacktooth's abbot suggest that be become a hermit.  And, in fact, that is the life Blacktooth eventually settles into.<br /><br />However:  During the middle of the book Miller wanders into a different story, or perhaps several.  I think he is partly trying to tell Cardinal Brownpony's story, of trying to achieve worldly success and ultimately failing.  As a counterpart to Blacktooth's story, this might have worked if told sparely enough.  But Brownpony is involved in electing popes, forging alliances among nomad tribes and arming them for a war he is trying to start, then running the war, and then . . . And Miller describes the customs of every group Blacktooth or Brownpony encounters, which adds to the richness of his world but is done in ways that really bog down the plot.  Every time Blacktooth seems close to some revelation, Miller switches to a meeting about complicated military strategy. Then Miller feels obliged to discuss everything that the enemy is doing and _their_ military meetings and . . . well, the intensity of Blacktooth's story is much diminished.  As other reviewers have noted, it also becomes confusing that all the major characters have at least two names, which are used indiscriminately.<br /><br />It is also odd that some major questions are left unanswered.  For example, the fate of Aedrea's and Blacktooth's twins.  The Wandering Jew confirms that she delivered them and that they were taken to the local orphanage.  Blacktooth goes to the orphanage, only to discover that someone has already adopted them.  I expected to meet them again in the book, or at least hear news, but they just vanish.<br /><br />Other times what could be significant moments are, essentially, passed over.  When Blacktooth meets the nomad cousins who rejected him as a teenager, this time they invite him to stay.  And he casually refuses.  I expected some emotional depth here, but it's more like he's stayed at a second-rate bed-and-breakfast; it was OK, not great, now it's time to move on.<br /><br />The pity is, use of the delete key during much of the middle, followed by some minor rewriting throughout the book, would probably solve most of these problems and create a book that does stand up to _Canticle_.  Apparently Terry Bisson either couldn't do this or wasn't permitted.  But:  _Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman_ is still worth reading.this might have worked if told sparely enough.

Its biggest drawback is Susan Hampshire, the actress who plays Becky Sharp.  In the book Becky is pretty, sexy, but not beautiful; she is also small.  She even has red hair, considered a decided drawback when the book was written.  Thackery repeatedly emphasizes that her successes are primarily due to her brains, which enable her to shine more than genuinely beautiful women.  Hampshire is blonde (or her wig is), beautiful, and tall.  Worse, she plays Becky Sharp in precisely the same way she plays the duchess Glencora Palliser in the Palliser series. She even puts her hand on her waist, sighs \\"Heigh-ho!,\\" and walks around stoop-shouldered in both films. Becky Sharp is no duchess, and I don't think these three mannerisms work well for either character.  Good posture in particular was important for middle- and upper-class Victorian women.  The announcer also has a suprisingly negative attitude toward Becky (especially for the 1960s); he repeatedly calls her a \\"bitch.\\"  In fact Thackery makes it clear that Becky is ambitious and manipulative, but she achieves results through charm, which she exercises towards everyone.  Becky is far too shrewd to alienate people, not only the ones who were useful immediately but the ones who might just possibly be useful someday.  He also describes her as \\"always good-humored.\\"<br />But:  Fans of the book will still want to view this film.  The other characters are played well, and the costumes and sets aren't bad for the 1960s.	2004-05-17
US	53088134	RZVNGE4T9H9CV	2234025087	114403008	Dickens	Books	2	10	18	N	N	Unreliable and verbose	As someone with a history degree, I find this biography infuriating.  The author uses the phrase &quot;no doubt&quot; to launch almost every other sentence.  Every use indicates a speculation rather than a fact; or at least something for which the author provides zero evidence.  Usually it is lengthy speculation on Dickens' emotions (including during infancy), but sometimes his actions; and sometimes the feelings and actions of his family, friends, and colleagues.  <br />Thus the author blithely--and firmly--attributes a miscarriage of Dickens' wife, after the sudden death of her teenage sister Mary Hogarth, to jealousy over Dickens' show of grief.  He insists Dickens' feelings for Mary were purely fatherly. But he gives no evidence other than Dickens' own public declarations, and Dickens is unlikely to have been candid about adulterous longings for a virginal female relative.  On the other hand, I myself would speculate that Catherine Dickens may herself have grieved over her sister's death.  But the author gives absolutely no evidence for how she felt about the death or Dickens' grief--no letters, no conversations reported by friends, nothing. On yet another hand, I would speculate that the miscarriage may have been due to purely physical rather than emotional causes, and its occurence after a family tragedy a coincidence--but the author does not discuss this possibility either.<br />And this is one of many, many instances.<br />I also got tired of hearing the author assert often and at length that society was different in the mid 19th century than now, which is obvious.<br />The author is much too fond of showing off his own prose.  He even includes lengthy, boring, and uninformative fictional vignettes using Dickens as a character.  <br />Overall, I'd say that the author is unable to distinguish among literary criticism, fiction using a historical character, and biography.  He should have stuck to one of the first two genres and not attempted the third.	2004-04-27

(The first book, _Ill Met by Moonlight_, I read some time ago and don't remember as well.) Both books are good; interesting takes on Shakespeare and his era, and full of action.  But, they share a common flaw.  <br />The major characters are all often conflicted as to their feelings, their views of other characters, their motivations, and the decisions they must make. That's not inherently a flaw; indeed, it could enhance dramatic tension.  But in these books it doesn't. <br />Every major character has one central conflict.  Every single time he/she experiences it (which is often), the author includes a full page of recapitulation of the character's conflict and situation, in one-sentence paragraphs rather like a list.  The list is usually about the same as when the last time that character's conflict was described.  This ends up being highly repetitive.  Then there are frequent recapitulations of the plot earlier in the same book and previous books in the series.<br />These two books would have been improved by the author showing the characters' feelings, conflicts, etc. mostly through dialog and action. Instead of endless lists of their internal feelings and the author's recapitulation of their situation.	2004-02-11

If you've already read the Sandman series, you'll understand who the Endless are. If not, this book may not make sense to you.  <br />Neil Gaiman can usually tell a good story; one whose characters, emotions, and plot involve the reader.  Here he succeeds with &quot;Desire,&quot; apparently set in pre-Roman Gaul, and in &quot;Destruction,&quot; apparently contemporary and set on a barren Mediterranean peninsula.  He suceeds to some extent, though not quite as well, with &quot;Dream,&quot; which arouses cosmic awe but which is not strong on plot or character. And with &quot;Death,&quot; which has a fascinating 18th-century world but a modern narrator who contributes little.<br />However, with &quot;Delirium,&quot; &quot;Despair,&quot; and &quot;Destiny,&quot; Gaiman fails.    &quot;Delirium&quot; has a sort of plot, but not much of one, and although it tries to be sentimental it fails to be emotionally engaging. &quot;Destiny&quot; has no plot.  The chapter just shows him in his garden, where we've all seen him before.  &quot;Despair&quot; doesn't even try to be a story.  I think it's a series of prose poems, but it doesn't work.  <br />As with Sandman, the art is very colorful, and by different artists.  <br />I'm sure many Sandman fans will buy this, and if they're fannish enough it won't disappoint them. I just wish the rest of the stories met the standards of the best three.	2004-01-12

I don't like romance as a genre, but was willing to stretch a point for the Lee story.  <br />But--Lee's story is really a romance despite a few fantasy trappings such as ghosts. Or perhaps reincarnations--I wasn't quite sure what was going on. It seems written for women who want relationships to entertain detailed fantasies of same. Complete with a mysterious, temperamental, dominant hero (he's a jerk) and lengthy kisses so ecstatic as to be absurd (it is just a kiss, after all).<br />I read most of the third story, and realized it was just another romance in the same predictable mold. Even though I almost always finish books, I gave up on the rest of this one--I never read the first story.  <br />So, if you're primarily a romance reader, you'll probably like this book.  If you're primarily a fantasy reader, probably not.	2003-12-06
US	53088134	RE0862AQ53SNN	1585674745	551051812	Venus Preserved	Books	4	1	1	N	Y	Good but not her best	I like the three previous volumes of _The Secret Books of Venus_ very much. _Venus Preserved_, while good, is not quite up to the same standard.<br />The story takes place in a Venus (Venice) of the future, a colorful, history-laden city reconstructed in an undersea dome. It is mostly for tourists. Permanent residents must be specially invited. The setting is a charming mix of eras, with the characters living in Renaissance palaces with 18th-century furnishings, eating in Victorian restaurants, and dressing in the clothes of any era they fancy. Venus is permeated with discreet but powerful computer technology; it is built into the doors, the walls, everywhere.<BR> <BR>The main characters are Picaro, a successful black musician newly arrived in Venus, and Jula, a 1st-century AD gladiatrix resurrected from her DNA. Both are well fleshed out. They have many ?flashbacks? to their former lives (Picaro?s dramatic and fateful life in this body, Jula?s in her 1st-century incarnation). The flashbacks do not feel like interruptions and they explain the attitudes of these two characters.<br />Less well drawn, but equally important to the plot, are Flayd the archaeologist (who had excavated Jula?s tomb), and Cloudio del Nero, an 18th-century musician also resurrected using his DNA. Flay?s character is pretty well drawn, but there is a sense of important past influences that are not sufficiently explained. Del Nero is not a real character at all, but a symbol.<br />These four characters probably represent the four elements.<br />The real weakness of this book is its plot. Flayd is certain that some conspiracy is afoot, greatly aided by the omnipresent computers. The city government closes off all further exit and entry. Flayd insists this is so some ?experiment? can take place. Contacts between these four characters are thoroughly manipulated, and their conversations are all probably monitored. Increasingly disastrous events take place, which make it clear that Flayd is correct._Venus Preserved_ has an apocalyptic ending, which I won?t reveal.<br />All this is dramatic, the ending is showy; but the plot itself, the events, have no purpose. The plot could be called the workings of Fate, since this always a fantasy fallback. But when references are made to an elaborate, expensive government conspiracy and minor bureaucrats are shown doing their part, I expect some disclosure of who is behind the conspiracy and what their goals are. Lee provides no such disclosure. There seems to be no sensible goal the government could possibly have. The minor bureaucrat characters not only have been told very little, they refuse to understand what they see (and what is obvious to the reader). As the book goes on, the major characters become less characters and more symbols.  By the end, this creates a lack of emotional response in the reader. <br />So the book has an apocalyptic ending? Who cares? It?s like the ?thunderstorms? Venus puts on for the tourists?preannounced, flashy to watch, but not personally involving.	2003-11-17
US	53088134	R3CAF9278UEBUI	0441328091	178447398	The Hero and the Crown	Books	4	8	11	N	Y	This really is a YA novel	I'm middle-aged but I read a lot of fantasy.  _The Hero and the Crown_ and _The Blue Sword_, which I read one after the other, really are too \\"young\\" for me. <br />Partly it's the theme of \\"outcast discovers she has strange powers that make her even more different from other people than she thought--but better.\\"  The theme of discovering one's identity and abilities is actually also appropriate to later stages of life (at least for some people, including me), but in these books it's a bit too uncomplicated to appeal to adults. <br />Partly it's the extreme wholesomeness of the romances--it really is OK to give this book to your kid.   <br />And partly it's all the cute horses and dogs and cats, and all the cute foals and pupppies and kittens they have at the end when the story is wrapped up. To be truly palatable, The _Hero and the Crown_ and _The Blue Sword_ require that obsession with horses shared by some adolescent girls. I grew up in the country, but never having gone ga-ga over animals in this way, it all got a bit cloying.<br />But again, if you have a kid who's maybe 13 to 16 years old or so, they might like these two books.	2003-10-30
US	53088134	R5KIK9F8MIHX9	0425191788	301916690	Sunshine	Books	4	1	3	N	Y	There Must Be a Sequel	The characters and setting are fascinating, the plot gripping. However, although one immediate crisis is (apparently) solved, this book seems like a big set-up for at least one sequel. The heroine is left with only a beginning understanding of her magical talents, not knowing whether her &quot;disappeared&quot; father and grandmother are alive and will reappear, suspecting her boyfriend Mel also has magical talents he's evaded telling her about, and not knowing whether she'll choose between Mel and, well, a more supernatural boyfriend.<br />Oh and the Special Other Forces (vampire killers) is pressuring her to join. Their local supervisor is so unpleasant (possibly this also is supernatural) that everyone calls her the &quot;goddess of pain.&quot;  And the supervisor takes a special interest in the heroine.<br />One flaw in this book is, the plot is slowed down by the heroine constantly and explicitly giving the reader buckfuls of background. I'd think there'd be a more subtle way to work it in. Another is, the heroine worries obsessively about the life-threatening crisis she's been dragged into and about her own magical talents (which she's managed to ignore most of her life). This is fine, except she repeats the same things over and over in much the same terms. It's true a real person would worry repetitively in real life--but in a novel it starts to drag. <br />Overall, it was a good book.  But I like to buy all volumes in a series and read them all together. I hope I remember the details of this volume if a second oneis published in a couple of years.	2003-10-09

Its status as an older classic by a Latin American writer means it is instead marketed as &quot;magic realism.&quot;  Do not, however, confuse this with the gentle works of such writers as Marquez and Allende. <br />Almost every story ends with at least one gruesome death. Many stories are entirely devoted to anticipating that death.  The protagonist gets bitten by a viper or slashes himself with a machete at the beginning, then dies for the next several pages.  There's not actually much &quot;magic realism&quot; in these stories, aside from a few talking animals.<br />The prose is certainly vivid, even in translation. If you like horror, I recommend this book.  I'll stick to Marquez and Allende.	2003-09-26

But, since Im middle aged, it tends to not be of the Young Adult sort. I prefer fantasy thats more literary, more sophisticated, and often, darker. In other words, not the kind thats full of Dragons, Sorcerers, Heirs to the Throne, Good Versus Evil, etc.<br />In terms of sophistication, this anthology was a disappointment to me. I can, however, see that it might appeal to those who do prefer Young Adult fantasy. But theres another problem. Most of the authors have apparently been writing about the same worlds for years. Most of stories are set in the authors worlds. Many stories purport to fill readers in on some unexplained aspect of some other novel, or are jokes about characters obviously well known to fans.<br />In other words, many of the stories are not only written for fans of these authors, but do not stand well on their own. As a non-fan, I was usually rather bored, somewhat mystifiedand not intrigued enough to hunt up any of the authors other publications.	2003-06-09

The desserts are in the American tradition of home cooking, and simple to make. The author has worked to make classic desserts not only low in sugar, but low in fat and calories. (I have no use for the low-sugar but high-fat recipes I've seen elsewhere; fat is bad for you.)  The author has tested the recipes thoroughly. Not only do the desserts taste good; the cooking times, procedures, etc. are correct.  <br />What I'd like is for the author to write another cookbook focusing on low-calorie versions of the fancy European style desserts I used to make (before I went on a diet and my husband found out his cholesterol is high).  I'm sure it would be wonderful.<br />By the way, Splenda really does taste exactly like sugar, and cooks like it except for having less bulk.	2002-12-09

They glitter, but are distant and ultimately, cold.<br />Set just before and during the beginning of the collapse of Napoleon III's empire, this book has tremendous potential for plot action.  Which is unfulfilled, apparently as a conscious literary conceit.  The author doesn't even tell readers what happened to the major characters, either the famous ones whose fate is recorded in history or others who are probably fictional.  Well, he does give some (welcome) hints in the Afterword, but this is not the same as incorporating a real ending into the book.  The characters fail to come to life or engage the reader's concern.  The book's conceit is that the political collapse was engineered by Hermes, the trickster god, for no reason except amusement.  Hermes truly does not care what happens to the human beings he manipulates.  While this is probably meant as a comment on the randomness and unfairness of history, the viewpoint of an indifferent god too closely resembles the viewpoint of an indifferent author.<br />The prose does, as I said, glitter.  So if you are willing to read a book mostly for the language, you might like _Hermes in Paris_.	2002-09-05
US	53088134	R3TVV56ML6RA6Q	1883642914	751040963	Creating Colette: From Ingenue to Libertine 1873-1913	Books	3	4	4	N	Y	But what was Colette really like?	This is a two-volume biography, and this review covers both volumes. <br />I believe the authors' purpose in _Creating Colette_ is at least partly to show how Colette carefully crafted her own image, and (unlike some biographers) to describe the \\"real\\" Colette. Colette was brought up in the country, but by a very unconventional and hardly provincial mother, who had moved in intellectual circles prior to her first marriage. Colette married the celebrated journalist \\"Willy\\" and joined Paris's bohemian inner circle. Its colorful members indulged in flashy costumes; unconventional behavior; the creation of avant-garde literature, music, and art; wild parties; drink; drugs; copious sex with members of both genders; and general \\"decadence.\\" Colette and Willy were deeply in love for many years, and he nurtured her as a writer--only later did they quarrel, divorce, and begin to damage each others' public images. When Colette married her second husband, the politician Henry de Jouvenal, she began to clean up her image, suppressing information about herself and asking her friends to comply. In old age, she finalized her image to that of the warm, earthy, frank Colette described by other biographers from Colette's own writings.<br />However, I did not finish this biography with any strong sense of Colette as a personality, but rather with an accumulation of many fragmentary and at times contradictory details. This is partly because of the sheer quantity of facts given about Colette's enormous number of acquaintances. Most of her acquaintances were colorful and the authors seem determined to provide all colorful anecdotes, whether particularly relevant to Colette or not. Though this gives some idea of the social atmosphere she moved in, particularly during her first marriage, it obscures information about Colette herself. I seldom knew what her relationship was to any of these people--which person was a lover, which a friend, which a professional associate, which a casual acquaintance. Aside from there being too much peripheral information, it is not well edited. The authors assume by causal references that the reader already has background information about all these people that I, in fact, often did not have. People are mentioned and then introduced to the reader as if for the first time several chapters later. <br />Although some extremely interesting facts are revealed, the authors fail to analyze them or draw conclusions. For example, they feel Colette's illness early in her marriage was syphilis because it was treated by a leading syphilis specialist with his standard \\"cure,\\" hot baths. But this information is then dropped, with no indication of what effect the disease had on her many subsequent sexual partners or her health in later life. (...) Colette disliked and neglected her daughter, letting other people bring her up. Yet this, her one pregnancy, occurred soon before she married Henry de Jouvenal, which she very much wanted to do. Why did she get pregnant--perhaps to engineer the marriage?  The authors fail to discuss this.  The authors describe how Colette's mother, during her last year of life and ill with breast cancer, wrote frequent,...letters begging Colette to visit her--which Colette refused to do, being too absorbed in a new romance. But I gained no sense as to whether there was any reason for this other than Colette's self-centeredness. The authors describe early on how favorable reviews of Colette's books and her performances as an actress were engineered by pressuring friends to write them, even Willy writing them under one of his pen names. Yet later in the book--which becomes a paean to Colette's success and acclaim, however achieved--the authors accept reviews of her work at face value. <br />This could have been an excellent biography if it had managed to clearly describe and separate the different images of Colette as publicity (first the bohemian, then the Earth mother), Colette as a writer, and Colette as aperson. And if it had a stronger novelistic sense--who is a main character in this story (aside from Colette) and who is not? What is the plot (as opposed to a collection of anecdotes and quotes)? Unfortunately, it does neither. But people interested in a partial debunking of Colette's oft-repeated images as an exploited young bride and later, an Earth mother will find it worth reading.	2002-07-16

The book begins as the narrator, Anodos, is officially celebrating his entry into manhood on his 21st birthday. A beautiful woman magically appears and offers him a visit to Fairy Land, which he accepts. Anodos then wanders through a magical forest experiencing encounters of two kinds. The first kind are with women old enough to be his mother or grandmother. These women not only feed and lodge him, but (though perfect strangers) listen to him, dry his tears, stroke him, and generally cosset him; which he thoroughly enjoys.<br />The mother-figures also warn Anodos against some encounters of the second kind, which is with women more or less his own age. One is a magical tree woman who rescues him from danger, holds him in her arms all night, and says she loves him. When he leaves her sorrowing in the morning he reasons that \\"she has all the pleasures she ever had\\" and \\"her life will perhaps be richer\\" for his memory, even though he did not stay. He brings a stone woman to life with poetry (the weakest aspect of this book is the abundance of second-rate poetry), but he is not supposed to touch her, and she flees from him. He encounters a second tree woman who takes him into her cave-bower. She tells him her life story, in which she continually refers to her own beauty, and \\"what followed I cannot clearly remember\\"-but when the story resumes, it's the next morning. He encounters a \\"little maiden . . . almost a woman\\" who carries a fragile globe. He keeps trying to touch it, and breaks it when he does so by force. She weeps, crying repeatedly that he has \\"broken her globe.\\"<br />Anodos does start to feel guilty about his behavior, the guilt represented by a black shadow that follows him everywhere regardless of the sun. However, he finds a fairy palace, which is probably a Christian allegory, where he meditates, reads, and contemplates. Healed from the wrong he has done others, he generously forgives himself and returns home (alleviating the anxiety his two little sisters have felt over his disappearance for three mortal weeks). The moral conclusion is, \\"what we call evil is the only and best shape, which, for the person and his condition at the time, could be assumed by the best good.\\" <br />Of course, there is the problem of what happened to all the women Anodos wronged . . .His only punishment is that the stone woman marries someone else--a knight he greatly admires, and he soon decides they are fully worthy of each other.	2002-04-03
US	53088134	R1OEFFIXWEPYB	0380975890	537308861	King of the City	Books	1	4	11	N	N	Not really a novel	I prefer Moorcock's more literary novels (such as Mother London and The Brothel in Rosenstrasse) and so was looking forward to this one.  <br />Unfortunately, King of the City is not really a novel. It doesn't have a plot, it doesn't have any sense of direction.  It has so many characters (all very colorful) and so many incidents (many very dramatic) that it is impossible to keep track of them all.  I can't even figure out how many times the narrator has been married, let alone which of the other characters were his wives.  Let alone the many marriages of the many other characters. Then there's the long rambles about politics and drugs.  The tone of the book is &quot;My wife left me on Christmas Eve, I did several drugs all night, went to my favorite pub for breakfast on Christmas--by the way here's a  history of the area the pub's in, the pub, and a character sketch of the bartender--had a conversation with a colorful old actor, heard on the radio that the plane on which my dearly loved cousin who is in the UN flew on was hijacked, immediately got a photo assignment so I could go to the Middle East to rescue her--here's an account of my rough flight, and here's a sketch of the town I flew to and its economy--then her kid with the unknown father and the mysterious several diseases died in my arms, then my cousin has negotiated her way out, then somehow I'm back in England and then I'm in prison and then . . .&quot;<br />And all this happens within a few pages. And the whole book is like this.<br />The publisher should have rejected this manuscript on the grounds that a novel is supposed to be more focused than real life. And if real life is as chaotic as this narrator's, the author's account of it should be even more focused.	2001-12-21

One peculiar thing about this book, is the narrator clearly says that the events in her childhood happened when she was nine--her &quot;collaboration&quot; with a German soldier and the subsequent disaster for her family and community.  Yet her behavior--her love for the soldier, her quarrels with her mother, and even the nickname the soldier uses (Backfisch is defined as &quot;a girl in her teens&quot; in my  dictionary) is much more characteristic of a girl of 13. It makes me wonder if the author or her publisher reduced the child's age to reduce her guilt in readers' eyes. If so, it's a pity.	2001-10-23

A gritty, fascinating novel much of the way through, but towards the end breaks down due to its lack of logic. <br />There are more complete plot summaries elsewhere on this page.  But briefly--the half-human half-rat-god Saul, his humanlike/godlike/ratlike relative King Rat, and the similar entities Anansi King of the Spiders and Loplop King of the Birds fight the evil Piper. The Piper is a mass serial killer who can dominate any human, animal, and even the Kings of the animals by making them dance to the appropriate tune of  his flute. Usually till they die of exhaustion but sometimes to achieve more long-term ends; that is, the deaths of still others.  He also kills people in messy manual ways, using his flute as a physical weapon.  <br />And partway through the novel the Piper discovers sound recordings, which makes him _really_ dangerous.  It seems to me he should have done this earlier in the 20th century.  But maybe when you're hundreds of years old you get conservative.<br />Obviously, the Piper has to be stopped--even though the three Kings and Saul all together may not even be a match for him.  Their air of desperation is convincing, except--after a battle where Saul is forced to crush Loplop's eardrums to keep him from hearing the flute, I started thinking &quot;Ear plugs!&quot;  Loplop and Anansi and King Rat seem more or less humanoid in form, so--why not?  They seem out of touch with modern life, but surely Saul would think of ear plugs?<br />And during one of the hand-to-hand combat scenes with the Piper, I started thinking, &quot;Guns!&quot;  Why don't they even up the odds a bit with some good weapons?  Maybe even a submachine gun?  Saul's a modern, technologically hip guy who grew up in a seedy neighborhood. Surely he can get guns?  Especially since he's learned how to be quasi-invisible (the Kings already know this) and can therefore easily evade people and steal.<br />Also, the music descriptions are really dull . . . I think if those had not slowed down the novel so much toward the end its lack of logic would not have been as obvious.<br />Still, it's a well-written horrific fantasy.	2001-07-28

And I liked it a lot. I thought Gaiman did a very good job of balancing stories with timeless appeal, that echoed familiar myths, fairy tales, and folk tales (even superhero comic books), with modern references to club Goths, pop stars, pop psych concerns, and so on.  (Actually the pop-culture references seem a little too geared toward increasing sales among teenagers, but I was usually able to ignore them.)<br />Then right afterward I read _The Sandman Companion_. I thought it would reveal greater depth in the work. More explanations of the mythologies Gaiman drew from.  More explanations of the symbolism he used.  More explanations of plots that were not entirely clear. (Like, why was Rose given back her heart late in the series?)  Even endings of stories that were not fully told. (What happened with Cluracan and his Nemesis?)<br />That's not what _The Sandman Companion_ is about.  It's for fans.  It's not for analytical readers.  Much of it consists of dull summaries of plots that readers who have read Sandman are thoroughly familiar with.  Most of the rest consists of trivial details like, which acquaintance of the author or an artist served as a visual model for which character in which comic.  They do not support the depth and power of the Sandman story.  Really they have nothing to do with it.  Bender seems to be catering to fans so hungry for any further connection with the work and its author that they feel privileged to &quot;overhear&quot; his &quot;intimate&quot; interview.  Which actually, seems to be merely very carefully calculated publicity.	2001-06-17

To understand it, it is necessary to read the whole series.<br />I have read and liked other books of Midori Snyder's (my favorite being The Inamorati).  This series is unfortunately inferior.  The historical background reads as if it was researched by attending a Renaissance and/or a Dickens Faire (street scenes and petty criminals in the main city of Beldan), watching a Middle Eastern dance troupe (the Ghazali), and reading a book about the problems with English (Silean) rule in Ireland (Oran).  Grafted onto this is a New-Agey idea of the country of Oran (not the planet, just this country) being maintained by four queens with supernatural powers drawing on the four elements (earth, air, fire, water).  Mixed in is some modern pop psychology about intergenerational conflicts, the fear of death, anorexia, and other current concerns.<br />Although represented as intelligent and resourceful, the characters don't act with ordinary common sense.  Perpetually pursued and attacked, hungry and cold, whenever they come to a recently deserted village (which is often), they almost never bother to look for weapons, food, clothes, or other much-needed items.  There are many other illogical actions.  For example, the Ghazali substitute the words of their native tongue for the most common words of the Oran language (such as &quot;yes&quot;) rather than more obscure or untranslatable ones.<br />This series is an unconvincing and tedious read.	2001-05-17

This is a reprint of the 1901 edition of _The &quot;Standard&quot; Work on Cutting Ladies' Tailor-Made Garments_, by the Jno. J. Mitchell Co.  It is a drafting manual and pattern book for women's tailored garments, such as suits and coats.  Like most such tailor's drafting books (they were published into the 1940s but died out along with custom tailoring), it gives the most basic patterns for conservative styles.  The garment maker was expected to vary the patterns to provide styles beyond the basics and/or update the basics to the season's trends; to provide his/her own trim ideas; and to draft/grade the correct size for the wearer.  <br />This edition is very similar to the 1908 edition of _The &quot;Standard&quot; Work on Cutting Ladies' Tailor-Made Garments_, which also has been reprinted and is available under the title, _Ladies' Tailor-Made Garments 1908_, by S. S. Gordon.  The 1908 edition contains many of the same patterns, but was reorganized and enlarged.	2000-10-30

To understand these books  you need to read them all, in order.<br />The series is set in a  well-described culture similar to Europe or England in the early Middle  Ages, with magical overtones.  Cefwyn is the crown prince and shortly  thereafter the king of Guelessar, a barely united group of provinces.  The  powerful nobles who run the provinces want considerable say in running the  kingdom, and some want to sieze the kingship.  Cefwyn, though shrewd,  cynical, politically experienced, and violent when necessary, spends most  of the four volumes trying to get and keep his nobles under control.  His  other threat is the neighboring kingdom of Elwynor.  Elwynor is equally  disunited because the former ruler (called the Regent) left only a  daughter, Ninevrise, who being a woman is not convincing to the Elwynim  nobles as a ruler in her own right.  Several of them wish to marry her by  force of arms and are fighting each other.  They also plan to conquer  Guelessar, with the help of Cefwyn's disaffected nobles.  Cefwyn's marriage  to Ninevrise partway through the series only gives him the responsibility  of uniting her kingdom in addition to his own.<br />The other main character  is Tristen, who provides the magical/fantasy element of the series.   Tristen is a Summoning (of a dead soul) by an ancient and powerful wizard  called Mauryl.  However, Tristen is incomplete or &quot;flawed,&quot; as  Mauryl says, having been created with the mind and knowledge of a child.   Mauryl attempts to teach him, but is defeated by a sorcerous enemy early in  the first volume, leaving Tristen to fend for himself.  Tristen walks to  the Henas'amef, the nearest city, where Cefwyn is in residence as governor.   Their paths soon intersect, with Tristen progressing from being Cefwyn's  semicaptive ward, to his friend and military ally, as Tristen learns, and  as abilities and memories magically Unfold to him.  It becomes clear that  Cefwyn's earthly enemies are allied with Mauryl's (and therefore Tristen's)  supernatural enemies, with Cefwyn and Tristen fighting different aspects of  the same battle.<br />Aside from the obvious plot of &quot;Who will win the  battle?&quot;  the other and more intriguing plot is the search for the  answer to &quot;Who is Tristen and what is his purpose in life?&quot; This  question is continually asked by Tristen and everyone around him.  He looks  like a Sihhe, who were five magical warriors brought from &quot;the  north&quot; centuries ago by Mauryl. They have long since disappeared (no  one knows whether they could actually die) but left many human descendants.   If so, which Sihhe soul is Tristen? The last halfling king Elfwyn, a  gentle scholar who was assassinated by Cefwyn's grandfather (along with all  the other halfling Sihhe he could find)? The original Sihhe Barrakketh,  a  very nasty warrior and ruthless ruler?  Will Tristen be forced to accept  the qualities or follow the path of the soul he was formed from?  What is a  Sihhe anyway?  A sort of wizard?  A demigod?  A god?  Is Tristen's purpose  to fight Mauryl's enemy?  Is he supposed to become the &quot;High  King&quot; who many people believe will return, and who they want Tristen  to be?  But what is the High King--the king of Guelessar, Elwynor, both, or  ?   And will Tristen simply vanish once his purpose is fulfilled, or once  some fixed period of time has passed?  Is the entire plot driven by fate,  or can Tristen and other characters control their destinies?<br />Fascinating  questions.  Unfortunately--the earthly plot _is_ resolved in this last  volume, complete with the satisfactory unmasking of traitors and pledging  of loyalties.  The supernatural plot is also apparently resolved.  However,  the questions about Tristen's identity and fate are never really answered.   Worse, the author implies that they are.  Mauryl's enemytells Tristen that  Tristen's nature is similar to his own--but what does that mean?  Tristen  becomes the High King--but what does that mean? Considering he would much  prefer to leave the business of rule to Cefwyn and Ninevrise and nobles  like his friend Crissand, to whom he turns over a title and governership  assigned to him by Cefwyn.  And even the kings and nobles fondest of  Tristen want to retain their own power intact.  The author says Tristen  explains to Cefwyn what being the High King means--but it is never  explained to the reader.  <br />This cop-out as to Tristen's identity is the  major weakness of the series.  The other is a scarcity of strong female  characters, particularly positive ones.  This is very much a male world, of  male friendship, loyalty, alliance, and achievement.  The author says  Ninevrise was educated to rule in her own right.  However, all she does for  four volumes is sit and embroider among the ladies of Cefwyn's court,  enduring their petty jealousies and backbiting over precedence and clothes,  while she waits for Cefwyn to reconquer her kingdom for her.  The  treacherous Aswydd twins, former mistresses of Cefwyn's, are somewhat more  interesting.  Especially after one bears a son who may have claims to the  succession.  But that's yet another question the author implies that she  answers, but doesn't.  And then--will Tristen, who has barely spoken to any  women, find a High Queen and found a new Sihhe dynasty?<br />The supernatural  means of communication and travel that Tristen and other characters  discover seem inconvincingly like plot conveniences.  And there is a bit  too much sentimentality--cute little ghostly girls and things like  that.<br />It's a good series, but it could have been significantly better.	2000-08-20

This book belongs to a type I've seen more and more recently--a book influenced by film and/or written with an eye to film adaptation.  <br />John Donnelly, a psychotherapist, acquires a new client, Laura.  She claims to  be the offspring of an alien plus a human parent (the human was abducted by  aliens).  Her descriptions of her upbringing among the aliens are detailed  and shocking.  Donnelly thinks Laura is suffering from elaborate delusions  brought on by a traumatic childhood. However, he is unable to shake her  delusional system.  Laura claims the aliens have given her one year to make  a human believe her (or something dreadful will happen).  She is also  trying to seduce him.  <br />The first half of the book consists largely of  descriptions of Laura's sessions and Donnelly's feelings--disturbance  because he is starting to believe Laura, guilt because he is sexually  attracted to her, grief over his mother's death, guilt over his long  enstrangement from her.  <br />Then madcap action erupts.  It involves  government conspiracies, secret agents, murders, colorful characters, love  affairs, time travel, alternative time streams, religion, Hollywood, and  visits to another planet with fancy scenery.  And lots and lots of easy  insights and meaningful emotional breakthroughs for Donnelly, his brother  Hogan, and several other characters.<br />I said at the beginning that this  book seems to be influenced by film.  What I mean is the nonstop action and  continual working to entertain the reader, by means of either emotional  insights or humor. It doesn't seem to matter which, as long as the reader  is entertained without having to think deeply.  Fine if you like this sort  of thing, but to me it seems rather shallow.	2000-06-05

A fancy-dress party lasting several days is in  progress.  Since anyone seems to be invited (and since the horse bolts)  Meaulnes stays.  At the party's end he is given a lift home (at night)  without ever discovering the domain's location.  He spends most of the rest  of the book trying to return to the domain, in both its literal and its  symbolic sense.  Frantz is also associated with the domain and searching  for a return to it.<br />The book draws a magical picture of rural France  around the turn of the 20th century.  As to the domain--it must be my  middle age showing, but I wanted a clearer moral position from the author.   Augustin and Frantz both unhesitatingly sacrifice the happiness, health,  and money of most of the other characters in quest of their romantic  ideals.  Not excluding the narrator; but especially they sacrifice the  women they profess to love.  I find it hard to accept this as any kind of  ideal.	2000-05-19

The urgency is partly financial:  Nanda's parents seem to live almost  beyond their means and she has no dowry.  It is also moral:  Given the  salon's racy talk and unconcealed sexual intrigues, how can Nanda long  continue to present an image of the &quot;pure young girl&quot; it was  assumed most men would want to marry?  And finally, it may be familial:   Does Mrs. Brookenham really want a younger female competitor sitting with  her daily?<br />Nanda's choices seem limited to three: The handsome, clever,  conceited Vanderbank, who she prefers, but who is not that well off and who  may be attached to her mother.   The ugly, awkward, but rich and kind  Mitchy, who prefers her.  And possibly, the elderly, conventional, but rich  and kind Mr. Longdon, who was in love with her dead grandmother and who may  turn out to be either a benefactor or a suitor.  <br />Nanda's mother is  highly manipulative, not only in trying to arrange her daughter's marriage  but in meddling with all her friends' affairs.  The grandmother to whom Mr.  Longdon always compares Nanda was the eptiome of old-fashioned purity and  reticence.  The other central question of the novel is:  Which role model  will Nanda choose?<br />In the hands of a less verbose writer, The Awkward Age  could have been action-packed, clever, and even moving in depicting the  limitations of its characters' choices.  As it is, James's hesitations,  qualifications, and reluctance to fully disclose his characters'  motivations partly spoil it.  We know (as much as James will ever tell)  which suitor Nanda chose.  But we are unable to gauge whether she has been  manipulative, and acted from cynical financial and social calculation, or  whether she has been &quot;pure,&quot; and acted from real emotional  impulse.  That is, we never quite know which role model she chose (thoughI  have my guess).<br />The novel is written mostly in dialog and reads in places  like a play.  Personally, I'd like to see it turned it into a play or film  script.  Simply cutting out a lot of verbosity could give it a clear  meaning and a real ending. I even think I know what she'd do with her life  after the novel ended.	2000-03-27
US	53088134	R5SVR8OCMUIMI	0312864523	117842815	Requiem	Books	5	5	5	N	Y	Great almost to the end	The main effect of this book on me was to make me search for alternative historical interpretations of the Gospels. Joyce's seems plausible, and I'd like to know if historians have delved into it.  <br />As for the plot--it is  an intense book.  The main character, Tom, may be experiencing either  religious visions or schizophrenia--or both.  So may other characters with  similar experiences.  The setting, Jerusalem, is always simmering on the  edge of violence.  Tom's feelings for his deceased wife and his friend  Sharon are intense but mixed, and not entirely understandable to him.<br />It  is a strength of the book that the author never &quot;explains&quot;  whether the religious visions are &quot;real.&quot;  It is a weakness that  the author never resolves Tom's feelings about the rest of his life, or  what he plans to do with it.	1999-12-30

I have several books on sports and dance injuries, and this is the best I own.  It is excellent for self care if you have a mild injury that is amenable to self care. (Of course, it is not a  substitute for seeing a doctor in person and if I had any questions or  doubts about an injury I would do so ASAP.)  It is also an excellent  supplement to a doctor, explaining what you need to know in detail,  defining terms, and giving anatomy diagrams.  It gives instructions for  care immediately after the injury, before you may be able to get to a  doctor.  It includes illustrated instructions for rehabilitation and  strengthening exercises.  This book has been a great comfort to me.  I get  very anxious if I am in pain and don't know what is going on, and find  explanations to be reassuring.	1999-12-30

It was better than I expected. The vignettes of life in New York (though I'm not a New Yorker) were detailed and interesting. <br /> However, Mr. Ives is a rather  one-dimensional character.  His only negative thoughts are about his son's  murderer--none of the petty angers, lusts, jealousies, etc. you'd expect  any person  to have, and a religious one to often work to overcome.  Ives'  first mystical experience is believable (though I don't believe in mystical  experiences).  He is not sure whether it is a sign from God or a mental  aberration--and if the former, what it means.  He fears and is puzzled by  it, which seems like a normal reaction.  But then his daughter has a  mystical experience that is shared by another person, so now we know  mystical experiences are real. His neighbor is visited by his wife's ghost,  saying one last, &quot;I love you,&quot; so now we know souls persist  beyond the grave, and that mystical experiences are benign.  Then Ives' son  appears in a dream and heals a skin disease he's had for years--and when  Ives wakes up it's gone.  So now we know God is good, too. <br /> In summary,  I think Hijuelos laid it on a bit thick.	1999-10-01

However, those not experienced in historic dance should be somewhat cautious about the descriptions and histories of  the dances. These do contain some errors. <br />For example, the author's  description of the Renaissance volta is that it &quot;required the  gentleman to toss his partner in the air, spinning her as she went, and  then (presumably) to catch her again.&quot;  Arbeau's original instructions  for the volta, however, describe a &quot;lift&quot; (the woman jumps while  assisted by the man), in which the partners never lose firm physical  contact.  The lift would probably be impossible if they did.  This might  seem like a quibble, but the author's surprise at the  &quot;energeticness&quot; of this dance might be less if she fully  understood how to dance it.<br />As another example, in a translated 1774  excerpt from Goethe, the &quot;allemande&quot; is described as a  &quot;waltz,&quot; and the author appears to think it is the same dance. In  fact, the allemande is an entirely separate dance form from the waltz.   There is an 1869 manual by Guillaume and another of the same period by  Dubois (I can't find my copy to look up the date), both of which are  entirely devoted to the allemande.<br />I could give more examples; but  anyway, if you are interested in the historical/technical information, you  might want to also read the original dance manuals used.  There is  currently a good selection on the Library of Congress web site.	1999-07-27

The morals of this book are that Beauty Is Only Skin Deep and People Should Forgive Each Others' Failings--simplistic enough to be potentially  sickening.  The imagery of the Fruit of Eternal Life/Knowledge of Good and  Evil and the Earthly Paradise likewise could be overly familiar.   Nonetheless this book is a masterpiece, largely due to a hallucinatory  atmosphere, strange settings, and a sardonic sense of humor. Frankly, I  preferred Cley while he was still wicked and the Well-Built City to the  Earthly Paradise.	1999-01-29
