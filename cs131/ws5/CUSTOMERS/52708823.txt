Then he includes a description of a trip to China to the only source of the \\"Tonkin\\" Bamboo.  This is a book that can, largely, be told by its cover. . . and it reveals a few truths about an esoteric art as practiced by a few of the current craftsmen.  It is not intended to be the definitive survey nor is it an unbiased critical review - it is what it says it is - a record of conversations between the author and some rodmakers he knows and a discussion of some of the rods, including the practice and the art of casting them. <br /> <br />This book has been criticized as just another publication by the John Gierach gang.  It is true that the book covers rodmaker Mike Clark and his \\"John Gierach- A.K. Best\\" taper rod and Gierach wrote the introduction, but that's hardly a negative; I'd assume that the critic would have said the same of members of The Algonquin Roundtable . . .  That said, Engle's writing style is his own and he derives nothing from Gierach's prose style.  <br /> <br />Another critic remarks that there has been prior publication of some of these interviews.  For this reviewer, it matters not one whit that some of the chapters are collected from other publications.  The prior publications are obscure and it is unlikely that many of the readers will have had access to them.   <br /> <br />This is a delightful insight into the worlds of a few people who make hand-made fly rods that sell for $900.00 and up (way, way up in some cases).  What Engle makes clear is that the waiting time for a custom-built rod, along the hundreds of steps and tens of hours that go into the crafting of one of these gems makes the craftsman's price close to minimum wage for the time and skill expended in the process.  Engle also points out that if you want a custom rod you will wait for it - there is no jumping the queue allowed.  There are some things that money simply can't buy these days. <br /> <br />This is a book about a niche within a niche within a niche and those of us who love fly fishing and everything about fly fishing will love this book, too.	2005-04-19

This is a very, very nice treatment of a niche within a niche.<br />Spey flies are Salmon flies - (and Steelhead flies) of the \\"Spey\\" persuasion. Spey flies are a traditional type of Scottish Salmon fly where most of the originals call for Herron feathers.  This fine book proves that the modern Spey fly can be tied well with substitutes for the original feathers.  <br />The history of the Spey fly, the materials and examples of many classic dressings are stunning and well presented through Mr. Veverka's prose and Mr. Radencich's excellent photography.  This book explores modern variations on these flies including an excellent, in-depth selection of modern Steelhead Spey flies.  <br />The dressing guides are well written and clearly illustrated (again, featuring Mr. Radencich's excellent photographs) making the task of tying the historical patterns within the reach of most mere mortal fly tiers.  The modern Steelhead Spey flies are well within the skills of any intermediate fly tier.	2004-03-22

Vince Mariano's In the Ring of the Rise, Darrel Martin's Micropatterns, Holbrook &amp; Koch's Midge Magic and now Ed Engle's Tying Small Flies.<br />If you followed Mr. Engle's column in Fly Tyer Magazine then you know how clearly Mr. Engle writes.  His writing style (like his flies) is brief, concise and well thought out.  This book is much more than a collection of the Fly Tyer articles (though it does contain updated versions of those articles) - it is an exploration of how a &quot;regular guy&quot; ties these little flies for tailwaters.<br />I recommend adding this book to your collection along with the predecessors.  Any fly fisher wanting to explore these flies will benefit from all of these books.  I know I have.	2004-03-21

Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill	Books	3	16	20	N	Y	Received Thursday, reviewed Sunday; with 87 prior reviews!	I'll keep this short.  I bought the book from Amazon with overnight delivery because the O'Neill / Suskind interview on a national news magazine last Sunday led me to believe that the book might be the subject of litigation.  Amazon shipped on Tuesday and I'd have had it Wednesday, save for a small delivery snafu.  Good Work, Amazon!<br />The book is the product of a team of people (see the acknowledgments beginning on p329).  O'Neill has solid information and much of it is relevant to the workings of the executive branch under Bush, Rove and Cheney.  The quality of the information, the writing and the presentation are worth the price.  The index, alone, is worth the price of the book.<br />The prior 87 reviews cover most of the subjects worth mentioning - but the overriding theme is clear: the present administration is \\"message-control\\" driven. This administration's policies always support their base - although the description of policy for the public (the spin) -  is king.  O'Neill fell for straying from the message de jour.<br />Finally, there are a few issues of interest about the book and the review process:<br />The book release was timed to make the most of the current election cycle.  It will serve as a contemporary reference, but it does not have the depth that it could have had with more research and writing time.<br /> The early reviews here at Amazon contain statements that are clearly false.  One reviewer states that they read this book in \\"the library\\", but this book was published five (5) days prior to this review.  Libraries, generally, do not receive advance copies.<br />I'm amazed at 87 prior reviews - I'm a fast read and reading this book over a  3 day period (I'm a lawyer and I have long hours) I thought was pretty quick.  I wonder how many of the reviews are political?  I've read all of them...many are valuable - but some are mere screeds.	2004-01-18

It is available in the used market and the copy I just obtained was in excellent condition.  It provides a number of color plates and technique guides - but Pryce-Tannatt was more than merely a technician.

The Swiss & French are the culprits!<br />This book starts with a fine historical review and moves on to a number of excellent patterns and techniques.  CDC dubbing is nicely addressed and it is a very valuable component of the book.  Overall, it is a fine addition to any flytier's library.  <br />There are a few areas that the book could have covered, and perhaps should have covered - but didn't. I don't know why - perhaps the editors limited what could be included - because I have no doubts about Mr. Links' skills and interest in the subject.<br />I would love to see more patterns and some newer techniques covered in this book.<br />For the last five years I've owned and used a tool of Japanese origin (sort of a three-pin bodkin) designed to allow a tyer to strip a hackle stem of all CDC plumes in a matter of seconds.  I've seen the tool for sale (albeit with Japanese instructions) in many flyshops in the US, Europe and Canada and the exclusion of the tool mystifies me.  Mr. Links uses the paper clamp / scissor / dubbing-loop method to transfer plumes, and he hand-strips or wraps or lashes the feathers - but simple strip-tie posts / wings are still more complex to tie than they need be.<br />Still, this is a fine work, and I strongly recommend it.	2003-05-29

It includes checklists, some history, the statutory and regulatory framework and a state-by-state review of the (now dated) caselaw.  Pb is spread, not as thinly as we would hope, over the entire US landscape.  We ingest, respire, and expire due to the physiological and neurological effects of this dull grey metal in its many forms.<br />It is a shame that this fine little book does not investigate, nor comment upon, the technical mechanisms of forensic identification of lead contamination.<br />This element has substantial bioavailability and thereby concomitant morbidity, mortality and teratogenicity.  <br />The nature of Pb in the environment is that there are few ways to avoid some exposure.  Absent some massive change in the way we use Pb, store Pb, remediate Pb and protect our children from Pb, this is the next wave of toxic tort litigation.<br />Pb is an interesting element.  It has many, many forms in nature.  The most common forms found in the mining process are \\"pure\\" lead, lead acetate, lead oxide and lead sulfide.  Bioavailability is determined by the state of the element when it is ingested.  <br />An interesting fact about the element is that the various lead ores found in Pb mines have very different and varying proportions of lead isotopes, depending upon the nature of the deposit.  Some naturally occurring lead isotopes are radioactive, and decay by emitting an alpha particle (4He nucleus). Alpha particles are positively charged and are ejected at a high velocity.  They are much heavier than beta particles (electrons), and given their high velocity, have a much greater ability to penetrate materials.  As alpha particles collide they can strip electrons from atoms in the adjoining matrix.  Low alpha lead is the \\"gold\\" of the grey metal market and is highly sought after by the computer industry (the fewer internal nuclear interactions in a complex circuit, the more reliable it is) at a premium price.<br />Lead can be tracked back to the mine it came from, if the search is made with diligence and an understanding of the chemistry, ore strata and isotope state of lead. One isotope of lead (204 Pb) is \\"primordial\\", or the \\"low alpha\\" isotope; it does not result from the decay of transuranic elements.  Other isotopes are \\"radiogenic\\", being either fairly stable ( 206 Pb, 207 Pb, and 208 Pb) or radioactive and unstable ( 210 Pb, 211 Pb, 212 Pb, and 214 Pb) decay products of  Uranium and Thorium isotopes.  Isotope ratios and chemical state are the forensic tools of the lead litigator.  <br />If you want to prove up your damages (or defend against them) the source of the contamination must comport well with the bioreserve in the victims.  As is the case in most toxic tort litigation causation is usually shown by circumstantial evidence and limited forensic proof (usually provided by a treating physician and a neurological expert).   The defenses to the tort are that Pb is ubiquitous in our environment and that primary toxicity does not equate to any one mechanism of delivery.  You could argue that the victim does not have Pb poisoning, but even the defense experts will have to admit the presence of the element in the tissues of the victim.  For either side in litigation, having a complete analysis of the chemistry and isotope ratios of the contaminated tissue will provide either litigation team with a far higher level of confidence in the result.	2003-05-13

The craft of writing is never easy and crafting short stories is far more difficult than blathering on for page after page in a mighty tome.<br />I could easily read this in an hour or two, but I'm reading these stories one-at-a-time because I want to enjoy each new story in its own space.  I guess I'm savoring this book as if it was some fine wine or a great pastry...you simply don't gulp it down.<br />Thanks again for your fine writing, Mr. Gierach.  The art of writing short fly fishing stories is a difficult one to master and Mr. Prosek, Mr. Leeson, Ms. Proulx, Mr. Luce, Mr. Babb, Mr. Proper, Mr. McGuane and Nick and Mari Lyons have all made the grade.  I won't try to rank any of these fine contemporary authors (though Mr. Prosek's watercolors and Mari Lyons' illustrations (not all watercolors) add a fine edge to the text in their works).  <br />Mr. McGuane notes on the slipcover that Mr. Gierach out fished him the last time they were on the stream together and that he would have been willing to give Mr. Gierach faint praise (if only to even the score), but Mr. McGuane - an honest fisherman (apologies to Sparse) - correctly rates the quality of this fine work (who would put a bad review on the slipcover, anyway?).<br />I own all of Mr. Gierach's works and this is one of his best.  Literate, humorous, and a nice guide for those of us who are a bit younger . . .we can see how a little more living helps hone an individual's perception of the important things in life.	2003-04-19

Montgomery does the thinking, the exploration, the examination and the analysis; all we have to do is read his book.  His descriptions of cutthroat trout and their environs, First Nations peoples (Native Americans / Indian), the steady changing of history &quot;ripping pages out of the history book&quot; as he calls it, and the incredible pace of destruction are both fascinating and chilling.  <br />Kathie Durbin's fine work on The Tongass, &quot;Tongass: Pulp Politics and the Fight for the Alaska Rain Forest&quot;, is a work of journalism, and it describes, with a very sharp focus, the same practices at work that Montgomery reveals in, &quot;Many Rivers to Cross&quot;,  in the  U.S. Nation's very first park.  Montgomery had it right from the start.<br />Law and public policy may be on the side of preservation and conservation, but as M.R. Montgomery and his colleagues make clear, &quot;wise use&quot; is anything but &quot;wise&quot; and once used, its gone.<br />Edward Abbey's, &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot;, is, apparently, the only answer that makes for popular reading.  This is a shame where Montgomery's prose and observational style are just as accessible as Abbey's.<br />Read this fine book, check out Ms. Durbin's excellent piece of journalism and consider whether Mr. Abbey was writing a novel or a policy proposal.  <br />In a day and age where greenhouse gasses are increasing, the US will not participate in the Kyoto accord and the lumber industry is nothing but a byproduct of the pulp industry - only books like these (ironically printed on pulped wood fibers) can educate us about the last of the wilderness.  <br />Teddy Roosevelt created the parks. . .M.R. Montgomery shows that it is impossible to argue that wilderness conservation is limited to people with only one political view or to just one special interest group.	2003-04-19

I have become more active in the fight to preserve the ONLY temperate rain forest left in North America because of her clear and concise use of well-supported facts.<br />The most disturbing fact not in the book is that the lumber industry is now nothing but a byproduct of the pulp industry.<br />Ms. Durbin shows us how Salmon spawning grounds destroyed out of greed and carelessness by logging right up to the spawning streams and destroying the shade that the Salmon's Redd's require, and by the disposal of low pH waste into bays and estuaries and by the effects of runoff from clearcuts (damaging sub-arctic land and water: a fragile environment, indeed).<br />There is no room to debate the facts...only the policy.

It is early March 2003.  We have nothing on our streams but midges (when -and if- the typical Ozark weather allows).  <br />I have not had a chance to try Mr. Moutter's latest patterns and techniques. . . but I can say that the book is interesting and seems to build on the solid base that his &quot;Paraloop&quot; method established.   <br />I'm so pleased with the quality of the techniques (and their success on the stream) from his first book that I ordered this book nearly a year ago.  <br />The new methods include use of foam in combination with the paraloop technique.  Unsinkable emergers!  I can't wait to try these later this spring.<br />This book follows the Oliver Edwards' fine Flytying Masterclass in guiding average tyers into very realistic (but simple to follow) new flies.  <br />The book covers more than emergers and foam and I can say that the little &quot;observations&quot; about streams, and certain people found there, make this a book for those readers seeking literature as well as instruction.<br />The dedication is as wise and kind as I have ever read.  Mr. Moutter is quite correct (in my opinion) about the difference between people who wet lines and certain types who don't.<br />I will augment my review after I have had the pleasure of working Mr. Moutter's new patterns and techniques on the stream.<br />Still, I enjoy the book and - both fly fishers and fly-fishing cat lovers' everywhere - will find something to recommend this fine little tome. ;-)	2003-03-14

You can easily tie a Jock Scott in hair wing or married wing with only a fair amount of time devoted to learning the new skills - if you are a decent intermediate Trout Fly tier.<br />A wonderful book by a living master.	2002-09-16

It was recorded at the a time when there were First Nations members who had the personal experiences of a lifetime and whose tradition was an oral tradition.  Dr. Walker (a physician and anthropologist) collected and preserved this oral history in the face of the destruction of most First Nation's cultures  through the intervention of the European cultures.<br />The narratives are all excellent and there are 90 + documents containing those first-person narratives along with several photographs.<br />The Bison Books edition has an extensive (and very valuable) series of appendices, including an extensive (modern) bibliography.  <br />The original Walker papers (or the majority, at any rate) are now part of the Colorado Historical Society collection.<br />A first rate piece of work by the editors, DeMallie &amp; Jahner, working from the primary materials created and preserved by Dr. Walker and his family.<br />An invaluable work.  This book -or at least excerpts- should be part of any text on U.S. History.  The inclusion of First Nations culture in our textbooks is rare, indeed.	2002-05-04

Best has more than a little skill in an esoteric field. His prior books: Production Fly Tying, A.K.'s Fly Box and Dyeing and Bleaching Natural Materials are all invaluable to a serious fly tier.<br />The latest book starts with an obsessive rant about caring for your vise. Archie: don't you think that some of us read the manual? <br />Aside from the vise care clinic, the book is a continuation of the kind of observations about materials and techniques that made his Fly Box and Production Fly Tying so useful. In other words, buy the book.<br />I would not be without the latest A.K. Best book...but I hope that his next work continues to provide us with his tying insights rather than ranting about vise care or some other trivial issue.<br />I don't own an expensive vise: I own a Thompson A and a pair of Griffiths and they have suited me just fine for the past many years. If any of them were damaged due to my misuse I suspect that it would have been very obvious. I simply don't fathom the rant about vise care. . .and it is a rant (thou shalt anoint a piece of T-shirt with 3 & 1 oil and store same overnight in a plastic bag so that the oil may penetrate the fibers of the cloth...)on a par with the Old Testament. <br />Archie, before you set a hard and fast rule about some physical mechanism I would suggest that you try reviewing the rates of surface adsorption of hydrocarbons in cotton-poly blends. <br />And this brings me to one other little matter: A.K. uses Chlorine Bleach to remove feather fibers from quills. This is a fine way to accomplish that process. A.K. has stated that he uses a baking-soda rinse to stop the action of the bleach. Well, NaHCO3 (baking soda)forms, in solution, Na+ and HCO3- ions making an alkaline (pH >7)solution. Common household bleach is Sodium Hypochlorite (NaOCl)and it is an OXIDANT meaning that it gives up electrons in a reaction known as a REDOX reaction. Alkali solutions are Proton Acceptors and Oxidizers are Electron Donors. <br />At best, A.K.'s the use of baking soda is harmless as a rinsing agent and at worst it has no effect other than to dilute the bleach remaining on the quills. <br />If one is going to give definitive instructions, one ought to review the science first. <br />This little issue aside, all of A.K.'s books have a place in every serious fly tier's library.	2002-04-28

I grew up in a city that had been more profoundly changed by the actions of this one man than anybody appreciated at local Democratic Club meetings on the Upper West Side.  All FDR Democrats, in the age of Lindsey, we had no real knowledge of the implications of the Cross Bronx Expressway destroying  neighborhoods.  All we knew was said by Ed Asner in  &quot;Ft. Apache, the Bronx&quot;.  We had no idea how devastating that road was to the social order...we simply knew that the South Bronx was holding its own in the race to the bottom that Bed-Sty had held for years.<br />It took Mr. Caro's careful and thorough review of Mr. Moses to tell us how so many changes took place without any real citizen oversight.  It is ironic that JHS 183 had us read &quot;A Tribute to Governor Smith&quot; as a part of our 7th grade history class.  Amazing and ironic as that little booklet is just about the only thing that Moses wrote for public consumption.  <br />His first patron rated a booklet...later he wrote his own ticket as Caro amply demonstrates by Moses' chutzpah in obtaining and maintaining his power base despite several very savvy NYC politicos' attempts to reign him in.<br />&quot;Build and be Damned&quot;, is the self-titled Robert Moses article in the December 1950 issue of Atlantic Monthly.  An apt title for his deeds and an apt epitaph for his deeds.<br />If the balkanization of the Bronx to Parkways on Long Island to Jones' Beach are at all of interest to you, read this book.  The blame or credit lays at Robert Moses' doorstep.	2002-04-28

That work well and truly set the tone for his life's work and the LBJ trilogy is now complete with the Path to Power, The Means of Ascent and Master of the Senate.  <br />The insight into the mind behind the 1964 Civil Rights Act is invaluable to any student of the Constitution.<br />Every Caro book is a must read for any person concerned with the U.S. political system in the 20th century.	2002-04-28

He was trying to become an &quot;elder statesman&quot; and given his political history of rising from oblivion -- Herblock had him and us dead square.<br />Walt Kelly (Pogo) and Herblock were the seminal political cartoonists of the middle of the century.  They are missed.  <br />This -- all too short -- book covers the only a few highlights out of a 50 year career.  Buy the book.  Herblock is gone, but  his  insights will not fade.<br />GRO	2001-10-10

He is an amazing writer now.  As he ages his writer's (and painter's) eye will absorb more.  If we are lucky, we will look at his observations and see if we can learn his methods.

The progress is more or less identical to what any reasonable human being would want in the late 20th and early 21'st century.<br />A man of insight, regrets, decent moral grounding and  capable of facing the difficulties of the realities of ecology (a/k/a  Cranes and Rainbow trout)  James Babb has molded a life worth living.   Would that we were all so talented and perceptive.  A biography more than a  fish story is to be had here.	2000-07-10

Micropatterns is thorough and detailed in every way.  This book compares well with the Fly Tyers Benchside Reference (Frank Amato press) for the clarity of prose and depth of detail.  I  believe a new genre has arrived.  <br />Mr. Martin has everything from  scanning electron micrographs of antron, broken hooks and hackle to the  delicate methodology of keeping 10-ought thread flat while tying.  The  illustrations are superb and well placed.  If 18-26 size flies are your  game, this is your book.	1999-04-24

This is not a book that provides patterns and technique; this is a book of techniques that may be applied to patterns.  <br />This wonderful book has very clear illustrations of just about every dressing technique I've ever  seen, or heard of, or wondered about.  The most obscure technique for  winging I know of, the &quot;reverse hackle&quot; or as the Brit's call it,  &quot;wonderwing&quot; is clearly shown.  I'd never run across anything  about this winging style, save for a few photos in European journals.  I  find the inclusion of this obscure technique amazing.<br />This book has  something for everybody: beginners will have choices for tying that are  easier (or, more sophisticated) than the guide they are working from; and,  intermediate and advanced tiers will find interesting new methods or new  uses for existing materials.  <br />I simply have never seen a survey of  technique this extensive anywhere in the (already voluminous) fly tying  literature.  <br />Mr. Schollmeyer's photos are sharp, well oriented and  highly illustrative.  Mr. Leeson's text (which is a substantial departure  from his superb prose work) is a model of clarity and concise description.   <br />Overall this is a fine work and one which will, I predict, become a  standard in the field.	1998-12-11

Between Joan Wulff and Cathy Beck we don't need no stinking he-man fly fishing writers.  I've enjoyed fly fishing with my husband for years.  I've taken courses and still he could out cast me for both distance and  accuracy.  With Joan's Fly-Casting Accuracy as a guide I've become more  accurate in the 15-40 ft cast than my husband who has fly fished 30 years  to my 10.  He's reading it now.	1998-12-04

This fine work, the first book by Hofstadter, is a marvel. He integrates classical philosophy, AI, set theory, Fermat's last theorem (now proven!), music and musical progressions and M.C.

This guide allows an observant non-biologist to classify many nymphs, emergers and adult acquatic insects.  <br />Besides the book you will need a good pocket loup, a small net, a collection bottle and a complete lack of  squeemishness.  <br />This book does much of the work of Schweibert's  excellent Matching The Hatch in a far more basic and compact package.  If  you are a trout / steelhead fly-fisher and you want to expand your  knowledge of the dinner faire of our favorite salmonids -- this is an  excellent place to start.	1998-11-23

This work is a fascinating study of the history of law and a fine advocate's perspective  of the western legal tradition from its British origins through modern  statutory and regulatory systems.  <br />The book opens with a man eaten by a  tiger.  Rembar then uses a Zen-like analysis of the man and tiger as the  introduction to his unique perspective on the evolution and application of  the law.  A fine, fine effort from the author of The Death of Obscenity.	1998-11-22

The book is limited to pure-foam or foam and rubber  flies.  The intention of the author is to provide a starting point for  tyers.

Gordon Liddy's insane forays into a psychiatrist's office and the abortive Watergate break-in by 3`rd rate Cuban CIA operatives led to the Weather underground and the feeling that the next US revolution would have to happen if Nixon were to attempt a third term. The book is a reaction to much social unrest and the rejection of popular mandate by the legislative, executive and judicial branches. <br /> Never the less, this is not a book for children or parties given to violence. It is a social commentary with fireworks.	1998-04-25

This fine work includes everything from modifying leaders to spotting bonefish to unusual fly casting techniques for difficult conditions.  The simple advice (a welcome change from the majority of the literature) regarding modifying commercial leaders to quickly change tippets and ensure a slack presentation is worth the price of the book alone.  My copy of this fine book is so dog-eared that I'll have to buy another soon.  An excellent reference work for freshwater and saltwater flyfishing and serious fly fishers.	1997-10-19
