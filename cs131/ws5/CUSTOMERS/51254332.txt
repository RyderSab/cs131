It's impossible to imagine such wind and cold.  Not to mention the oxygen deprivation.  Or that fact that death appears to be an accepted consequence of climbing Mount Everest.  I climbed Mount Fuji, and that was enough for me.  It gave me a taste of the effects described in this book.  I thought the author did an excellent job of telling a straightforward story without blame and with recognition of his role in the events.	2005-10-13

It was a wonderful day, filled with great music.  As Faron Young's biographer, I made many contacts who were later helpful to me.  Franks wrote an important story, and I enjoyed reading about all the familiar names.  What detracted from the book was its lack of editing--numerous typos and other errors.  Still, it contains much valuable information about people like Jerry Kennedy, Glenn Sutton, David Houston, Johnny Horton, Claude King, and many others.	2005-10-10

His story adds to the music's history.  I downgraded the book because his facts are sometimes shaky.  For instance, he says Faron Young \\"went through a series of relatively brief marriages and divorces.\\"  A series?  Relatively brief?  Faron's only marriage ended in divorce after 32 years.  The statement made me wonder what else in the book I shouldn't believe.  In spite of that, this is a good book, and I enjoyed reading it.	2005-10-10

I skipped to the end and listened to the 7th disc.  And I hadn't missed anything--there was no plot.  It's mostly just a bunch of people thinking about sex. Who cares?  The book has weak structure, with the book club and an out-of-place first-person narrator apparent attempts to tie the characters together.  How could this possibly be compared to Jane Austen?	2005-08-13

I remember when the trio broke up so they could raise their families.  But I could never have imagined the pain and financial hardship associated the decision.  It's also hard to comprehend how such hitmakers could be broke, but it seems to have been a common occurrence in those days.  The more biographies I read, the more I realize the importance of strong management--and honest management.  Maxine tells a great how-it-was story in a tone that's easy to follow and sympathize with.  The only problem I had with the book was the confusing chronology.  She jumped back and forth without letting the reader know what year she was in.  Other than that, it was an enjoyable and illuminating story.	2005-04-13

But Lula got lost after Stevie started recording.  Granted, the table of contents says Part II is about Stevie.  But the covers says, \\"An Authorized Biography of Lula Hardaway.\\"  I wanted to know where Lula was during Stevie's teenaged years.  We suddenly find she's in a second marriage and has more kids.  Then we learn she's divorced (for a second time--we never learned about the first divorce, either) and living in Los Angeles.  The ending brought her back briefly, and reminded us of her message.  I would have liked the whole book to be about her, as the cover promised. She deserved it.	2005-01-10

Author Lange divided the sub-genres of country music into six categories: Progressive (pre-WWII), Western Swing, Postwar Traditional (includes bluegrass), Honky-tonk, Country Pop, and Country Blues. I enjoyed learning about the origins and variations, as well as reminiscing about the singers and songs familiar to me.  Faron Young, correctly so, appeared in the honky-tonk category. <br /> <br />As a lifelong follower of country-western music, I consider the author knowledgeable and accurate.  I highly recommend this book to country fans, old and new.  Both groups will gain an appreciation of their music's roots.  It will also be a revelation to those who complain about the state of country music today.  The new vs. traditional struggle has existed since the beginning, and \\"our\\" music continues to evolve and survive.	2004-11-02

She's a master of characterization and detail and suspense. I <BR>really enjoy her work--and the characters of Scarpetta and Marino. They seem like real people with real feelings and flaws. But what's with all the cussing in this book?  A few well-placed words are enough to get across dialogue and personality. The cussing progressed as the book did; her two previous books weren't like this.  It detracted from a good story, and took away my interest in reading any more of her books.	2004-04-28

It's a good story, and I especially enjoyed hearing the author himself telling the story.  But the cussing became so constant that I didn't let the girls listen to the second half.  An otherwise great story was ruined by the excessive use of words that detracted rather than added.  I don't need to hear GD on every page to get the idea that people actually talk that way.

I was as impressed with the writing as with the subject.  I read this as research for the biography I'm writing about Faron Young, and I must admit to disappointment--but not surprise--at the lack of mention of him.

Lori Torrance lost my respect in the very first paragraph of the book, with her statement, &quot;Country music twanged on the radio, Hank Williams crying in his cornflakes again.&quot;  A few pages later, she says, &quot;At that time, easy listening and my-dog-has-fleas country music monopolized the mass music market.&quot;  The research was useful but the flippant writing was a turn-off.	2003-07-19

But I knew what a good writer Peggy is, so I bought her book.  After reading it, I feel like becoming a crusader for letting expectant parents choose their childbirth method and for insurance plans to encourage midwifery.  I sympathized with Peggy when she got sued, and I felt the injustice that is so common in our litigation-happy society.  This is much more than a \\"pregnant women\\" book.  Besides being a human-interest story, it offers the suspense of a lawsuit and an education in medical care and insurance practices.  I highly recommend it.	2003-05-29

My daughters enjoyed comparing the characters and scenes from the movies to what was in the book.  Betty MacDonald, whom I knew nothing about, amazed me with her sense of humor.  My 10-year-old commented on the unexpected twists that often changed a sentence into something totally hilarious.  The only negative, other than the unkind portrayal of some characters, is that some sections of description were long and boring.  In general, this was a hilarious book, and I'm glad we found it.	2003-05-29

I enjoyed learning about Brenda's life and career, and am amazed by her energy and the number of people she knows.  The part of the story told in first person is a balanced narrative, explaining but not bragging or complaining.  It's truly mindboggling that someone can generate a star's income but be forced to live in poverty.  I like the concept of having quotes by other people interspersed with Brenda's story, but I sure did get tired of reading about her great talent and showmanship abilities.  She brags about herself through quotes of other people.  Cutting out that repetition would improve the book.  My only other complaint is that the book jumps around and is hard to follow.  A person dies in one chapter and is alive in the next.  Brenda gets a makeover and a new stage show, and then jumps back several years to talk about getting married.  It would give a smoother picture to learn about the marriage and babies before reading about world tours and stage shows that the reader has been led to believe occurred while she was single.  As a lifelong country music fan, I am pleased to now understand where and how Brenda Lee fits into the business.	2002-08-25

This book contains much good information, but I wonder how the writers define &quot;country.&quot;  In spite of all their hits, the Wilburn Brothers rate a two-inch column and David Houston gets three inches.  Yet many, many performers I've never heard of  (and non-country ones I have heard of) get a page or more.  How often has Grateful Dead ever been played on a country station?  Faron Young--a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame--is allotted one page, but Neil Young gets six.  How many times did he appear on the country charts?  None that I recall.  Even the historical Carter Family is limited to two pages.  There would have been room to give more information about more performers if the book had fulfilled the promise of its title.	2002-06-25

It's a good depiction of his rise to fame.  I don't know enough about his personality to comment on the accuracy of how he's portrayed here.  I'm surprised that those close to him refused to comment.  Faron Young's family and friends are being quite helpful in my research for his biography, and I'd expect that of anyone who wants an accurate biography.  I've always liked the music of Jim Reeves.  His enunciation impresses me-- unlike most singers who sound lazy by running words together.  Of special note with this book is a 6-song CD as part of the package.	2002-06-12

Sally Spears did a good job of researching and writing this book, and she was more objective than I'd expect a mother to be.  It's easy to see Kara brought on a lot of her own problems, but I understand the reasons for her behavior.  Because of our different personalities, I wonder whether I would have liked her as a fellow officer.  <br />I have the greatest admiration for this first generation of female fighter pilots.  Being a woman in the man's world of naval aviation is tough.  (I know that from my experiences, described in \\"Navy Greenshirt: A Leader Made, Not Born.\\")  And fighter pilots are tough on each other.  To take on that double challenge and succeed in this harsh environment requires a woman with extraordinary guts and determination.  Those who haven't experienced the emotional pressure can't comprehend it.<br />As for whether Kara got special treatment, people seem to forget the pilots who trained these \\"tokens\\" are ordinary naval aviators (and men), and I have to believe they wouldn't give false grades because of command pressure.  It they did, they don't deserve to be commissioned officers. Kara did get special negative treatment.  Releasing a mishap investigation to the public, as someone released hers, would normally be a court martial offense.	2002-06-06

The unique letter format of this book is well done and easy to follow, if a bit too long.  But the whiny attitude got to me.  It seems the protagonist spent her whole career thinking about her future and running to her admiral buddy for help.  She also slams naval aviators.  For those interested in learning about the next generation of female Navy officers, my memoir, &quot;Navy Greenshirt: A Leader Made, Not Born,&quot; offers a different perspective.  &quot;My Navy Too&quot; does not represent all women officers.	2002-06-03

It brought back childhood memories of familiar locations and names.  The author uses an interesting technique of telling the story with different points of view in each chapter.  It makes for enjoyable reading even though it's a mostly fiction story based on real characters.  The author's POV is used often enough to bring out the emotions of a coming-of-age story and the social aspects of mid-Thirties farm life.

In truth, I don't care whether the music is authentic or commercial.  Most of us are smart enough to  realize music is a business and people are in it for the money.  I listen  to country music because I love the sound, and I especially like fiddles  and steel.  There's no reason we must give up those instruments as a sign  of progress.  There's plenty of room in the business for traditional and  new music.  As for the Coke analogy, Classic Cokes tastes better than new  Coke--that's why people wanted to keep it, not because they didn't like  change.  The author says she kept the Rose Bowl and college lives separate.   Well, country music is an integral part of my life.  I guess that makes me  authentic.  I wanted to learn about the development of the Nashville Sound.   Instead I got a lecture on the meaning of commercialization and I was told  to grow up and accept the fact that life changes.

Instead, he seems to revel in reliving those painful details and doesn't  regret his behavior.  Jessi deserves more gratitude than he expresses  toward her.
