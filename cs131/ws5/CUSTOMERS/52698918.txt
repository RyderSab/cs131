Herland gives us some insight into such a hypothetical world.  What would the crime level be like?  How about wars? Rape?  All of these terrible  things are often initiated by men.  Although a female-only society would  probably be much less utopian than Charlotte Perkins Gilman's Herland, it  is still interesting to speculate.  Even the late Dr. Richard Dehann, a  doctor and Bible teacher, speculates that original sin is inherited through  the father; so maybe Ms. Gilman's land is not so far-fetched.  It still  makes interesting reading.  If you are interested in female-dominated  societies, check out Suzie McKee Charna's Holdfast Chronicles, Marion  Zimmer Bradley's Free Amazons of Darkover, and/or Joanna Russ's Female Man.	1999-08-29

I have sometimes wondered what the world would be like in a matriarchal society where women made most of the decisions.  Would women be as violent and war-like as men  have been throughout history?  I doubt it!  However, the women in Ms.  Charnas post-holocaust world are surprisingly like their former (male)  masters.  I prefer the utopian world of Charlotte Perkins Gilman's  &quot;Herland&quot;.  Neither worlds are particularly believable.  But it  is interesting to speculate.	1999-08-29
