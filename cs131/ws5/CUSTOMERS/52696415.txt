Each bird is drawn in a different geographical setting, accompanied by a different child, so it is also a multicultural experience.  Plus it is sumptiously illustrated.  It is one of the best bird books that covers birdsong for young readers that I have ever seen, and I've been looking/teaching for 20 years.	2004-06-08

Also kids who are intimidated by longer books.  Also good for higher level readers in earlier grades, 2nd to 3rd, for example.  Very accessible telling of Rachel's life, the author blends well the details of her personal life with her professional life, weaves a good story.  Quite poetic in parts, disadvantaged, introspective or nature loving kids may find it inspiring.  The only gripe I have is that it is a little short on details, but for some kids, less is more.	2004-06-01

Wasn't able to read it at the time, but I picked it up this fall, thought I would read an essay at a time before bed, like I usually do with essay books.  Sometime in the wee hours I realized that I had to stop reading or I would head out into the dark night and wander until I found the wilderness again.  Few modern writers, or writers of any age, have so clearly and eloquently expressed what it means to love the wild, what we are about to loose, and truly why we are loosing it despite efforts to the contrary.  Turner's solution is one I believe in, but rarely find seriously advocated, probably because it would work.  Frankly, if you haven't gone wild, you may not &quot;get&quot; this book.  If you want to really know what the wild is about though, read this book and if you like the sound of things, go seek it out.  If you are wild, this will be one of the few books on the topic you can stand to read these days.  I haven't been so enlightened since I read &quot;The Practice of the Wild&quot; by Gary Snyder.  Five stars means a great book.  Some books are beyond that, this is one for the ages.	2003-11-18

Before that time the vegetation was being denuded by moose, and the moose herd was suffering.  The island was the living laboratory for some of the classic research on the relationship between predators and their prey, and the role of predators in an ecosystem.  It also relates to another classic essay by Aldo Leopold, called \\"Thinking Like A Mountain.\\" again, about wolves and their relationship to their prey and to the ecosystem as a whole.  These concepts are important to teach young children, but the research and essay above would be hard for young kids to understand.  This book serves as an excellent introduction to the topic.  There are few books out there that tackle this important subject, this book fills the niche.	2003-10-30

It plays too much into the \\"noble savages/thoughtless europeans/rowdy teenagers\\" stereotypes that are insulting to all those groups.  Stereotypes, whether they be good or bad are not helpful to the intellectual development of young people and will cause many (especially in the stereotyped groups) to tune out.

It addresses my number one diet and exercise struggle--the one against stress.  I wasn't bothered by the &quot;menopot&quot; term, since Dr. Peeke outlines in some detail why it is a common problem and health risk.  And she makes it clear that you don't need &quot;six pack abs&quot; to address the problem.  All in all her suggestions and approach are very do-able and what I especially liked is that she realizes we all don't have personal trainers, unlimited discretionary time and private chefs.  She gives many practical examples of how the average time-crunched woman can fit her suggestions into their lives.	2003-07-15

Her ideas are easy to grasp and practical to implement, and fun!  I recommend this book to all my friends who are expriencing general dissatisfaction with their life but who are not sure what direction to take next.  The book has excellent goal setting exercises.  It can be used again and again to plan and actualize various aspects of your life's dreams.  One note of caution: bear in mind one of the other reviewer's comments about accepting everything in this book as gospel truth, especially the case studies and anecdotal results.  Then read &quot;Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience&quot; by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi for some ideas with actual scientific backing.  (No that's not a typo!)

Many people raved about the book so I bought it and I think obviuosly the book delivers in all of the areas mentioned.  But I agree with another reviewer who cautions about perhaps needing to look through the actual book before you purchase it.  Or look over some of the less than stellar reviews and see if any of their complaints strike a familiar chord.  It's not that I think the writing exercises in the book are useless, but I also felt the anecdotal style tended to obscure the points rather than clarify them.  Again, that's my take on it, some might find the stories helpful.  Also, the book's premise bothers me, since it is not scientific in the sense that association does not prove causality.  Just because you wrote something down didn't make it happen, that was a coincidence.  I could have written a book titled &quot;Write It Down It Will Never Happen&quot; and sought out just as many stories of people who wrote down their dreams and they didn't work out.  (Not exactly the recipe for a best seller!)  I am a life's dream list maker and many of them have not come true, but for those that did, writing was an excellent tool for accountability and reflection.  So while I liked the author's premise that writing is a good way to sort out your thoughts, find direction in life, and self-actualize, I was distracted by the gee-whiz stories and had to struggle to tease out the practical applications.  There are some excellent ideas in the book, so you might enjoy it as much as so many others have, and find the stories illustrative.  On the other hand, you might also want to consider &quot;Wishcraft: How to Get What You Really Want&quot; by Barbara Sher.  That book helped me tremendously.	2002-11-22
US	52696415	R1S96V8PYXL8CE	0395911729	576778811	A Peterson Field Guide to Wildflowers: Northeastern and North-central North America (Peterson Field Guides)	Books	5	104	105	N	N	Easiest book for everyone	I've been teaching in the outdoors using field guides with novices for 18 years, so I offer this advice to assist beginners in choosing a wildflower guide.  I have used both this book and the Newcomb book and greatly prefer this one, although Newcomb's is very good.  Newcomb's uses a series of keys, which I guess some people find more &quot;sophisticated.&quot;  Although the key in Newcombs isn't hard to use, I find that the Peterson guide is faster and easier to use in the field.  I have also observed that beginners are less likely to make mistakes using the Peterson wildflower guide.  The big plus of the Peterson book is the identification system.  The flowers are first arranged by color and the book is color coded.  Although wild plants may not always be showing their flower colors, 9 times out of ten when the amateur is identifying a flowering plant, it will be in bloom.  You can use the Peterson guide to learn the key characterisitics of a blooming plant so that later on when it is not blooming you will still be able to find it in the book and recoginze it.  <br />In the next stage of the Peterson wildflower guide's organization, the plants are arranged by similar visual characteristics.  There is a simple outline and description of this system at the beginning of the book.  The book utilizes helpful icons, which are featured at the tops of all the descriptive pages for quick thumb-through reference.  I have found this icon system very helpful in teaching plant identification because it provides a systematic approach that the beginner can pick up quickly and easily.  The Peterson system greatly facilitates intial accuracy of identification at the level of plant family.  Once you learn the system of what to look for when observing a plant, the icons allow speed and efficiency when using the book in the field.  <br />At the final stage of identification, the species level, the Peterson guide has excellent written descriptions and the important subtle differencesbetween species are well highlighted, with both text and arrows on the drawings.  As other reviewers have stated, the Peterson book has more illustrations than Newcomb, and the highlighted habitat/range descriptions also help in quickly placing a plant.  The black and white illustrations are not bothersome since you already know the flower color, and line drawings show key characteristics clearly.  The use of illustrations instead of photos is always preferred in a field guide, even though photos seem like a good idea at first glance.  A good illustrator shows the plant in the best light and makes sure the key features are visible and prominent.	2002-10-25

This book is a success because the text is interesting and thoroughly covers the major topics of tree identification and structure.  The books also covers the relationships that trees have to the total environment such as providing shade, economic products for humans, and wildlife habitat.  A very important feature of an early elementary science book is that the photos enhance the text and provide relevant illustrations for the teacher to use in conveying the concepts.  Some picture book photos are obscure, but not the ones in this book!  \\"It Could Still Be A Tree\\" gets an A+ for effective use of photos!	2002-09-03

I have a huge collection of pre-school, early elem. books on insects, but none of them cover the type of metamorphosis that the lady beetle goes through, with the larvae looking totally different than the adult, and the pupae looking . . . well not like a butterfly cocoon, that's for sure, just a spotted lump!  I was conducting a class for middle school teachers and we found a lady beetle pupa on a leaf and I thought in might be a gall.  Luckily my book order for the early elementary class came in and I noticed the picture in the \\"Are You a Ladybug\\" book that explained what we had found.  That's a pretty good endorsement for a pre-school book, that it can teach a middle school science class new information!  Also, this book is very usefull to teach about how insect predators help control pest populations, since the beetles in the book eat aphids and more aphids.  Again, this type of information is not often found in pre-school level books.  I bought the grasshopper book too, and I like these books so much I am ordering the whole series!	2002-09-02

So this book can be used by beginning and more advanced readers.  The combination of humor and information is a winning combination for kids.

The story has a sense of humor that kids and adults will enjoy.  The cartoon-like pictures are fun too.

(The Science of Living Things)	Books	2	12	14	N	Y	Flawed exposition of evolution	This is such a good book with thorough, well illustrated and clearly written coverage of so many important concepts of bird biology, adaptation and natural history.  It's well laid out and well illustrated with a mix of drawings and photos.  I liked that it covered feathers and flying mechanics.  But it has a fatal flaw in the paragraph on bird evolution.  Commendable that they even mentioned evolution I guess, but they did so in such a way as to promote the confusion and misunderstanding of this important biology concept.  Here's the paragraph: \\"Scientists believe that birds were reptiles millions of years ago.  Some reptiles evolved, or changed, in order to survive.  They grew flaps of skin between their front and hind legs and used these flaps to glide from tree to tree.  In time, these flaps became feather-covered wings.  It took millins of years, but these ancient reptiles learned to fly.  They became birds.\\"  This is followed by a picture of a reptile climbing up a branch, gradually morphing into a bird that takes off to fly.  There are several problems with this explanation--birds weren't reptiles millions of years ago--modern reptiles and birds have common ancient ancestors.  Evolution happens at the level of a population, not an individual, so evolution is not change within an individual, it is change within the genetic makeup of a population.  And the reptiles didn't \\"grow\\" flaps of skin between their front and hind legs, again, this happened over time through changes in the genetic makeup of the population when those individuals who had the flaps because they were born with them had a survival advantage and passed this trait on to their offspring.  Lastly, the photo of the reptile morphing into a bird all taking place on the same branch give the impression that evolution is quick rather than taking thousands of years and thousands of generations.  I don't know how I would describe this to an eight year old, but I wouldn't do it the way it was done in thisbook.	2002-06-24

The author had an excellent idea, and it took a lot of creativity to come up with the scenarios in the book.  They are interesting and amusing.  Young kids who are really into birds and motivated to learn the calls might enjoy reading this book and going over the calls and learning the different birds.  They might relate to the birds and enjoy the scenarios.  That's on the plus side.  On the minus side, less interested and motivated kids might be confused or bored by the book.  On some pages there are uncommon birds and birds that make the same sound, which if you're not familiar with the calls already, might be confusing.  Also, the birds are not labeled on the page, they are listed in the back.  It is good that the information is there, but if you don't know the birds it breaks up the flow of the book to have to check in the back.  Also, the pages had a lot of birds on them, and the juxtaposition made it hard to absorb the individual calls.  A clever teacher might be able to make something of this book but I was hesitant to give it a try.	2002-06-24

The design is exquisite, the illustrations compelling with lush, gorgeous colors.  The story is a fascinating one and the idea of turning it into a picture book for younger children was fantastic.  It has many important themes such as the struggle for women's sufferage and the idea of empowerment, working for a cause you believe in, and the elements of successful political action, all told in a way that young children can understand.  However, I found the text just a little too preachy for my taste, and I am very sympathetic to the cause.  I don't think environmental causes are helped by looking down on those who view things differently, instead I would like to read books that help children to understand why there are differences of opinion and have empathy for those who are different.  I found the words like \\"silly\\" \\"disgusting\\" \\"revolting\\" \\"nauseating\\" \\"ghastly\\" used to describe feather-wearers to be unconstructive, uncompassionate and not particularly admirable.	2002-06-24

Good coverage of the information for younger students, which is hard to come by.  The information is clearly written and well orgainzed.  Many of the photographic illustrations are excellent.  On the negative side, there is a lot of information on each page, and not enough concrete illustration of the major points.  Sometimes I felt as if the text and the pictures were not well coordinated.  Some of the photographs were rather extreme or slightly asbract examples of a concept.  The use of some exotic birds may interest many kids who are fascinated by the unusual, or who live in areas where the birds are found, but other kids may find the examples too far out of their range experience and therefore less compelling.	2002-06-24

There are different learning styles and tastes out there, so some folks may not &quot;get&quot; this book, just like different students respond to different teaching styles.  Read through ALL the reviews before you make up your mind, or at least a large sample.  The prose is a little over the top, slightly exaggerated which I thought made if fun and humorous to read.  I didn't get the serious impression that Mr. Wong doesn't want kids to have fun, rather he wants them to feel that education is is vitally important and worth sustained effort and concentration.  He writes in a behavior modification mode, which I found helpful because I was trying to change and modify my own behavior in the classroom.  Non verbal communication, spatial organization, words and tone all have a profound impact but many don't realize this, which is why there is so much detail about seemingly minor points.  Wong makes the intangibles tangible.  One of the greatest tips I got from the book was the power of using someone's name when I was speaking to them, and if you think that is a trivial thing, try it--address people by their names and look them in the eye more often, do it consistently with sincere warmth and you'll be amazed.  And Wong breaks this little behavioral gem down into a step by step technique.  Funny and amazing at the same time!  Wong's techniques are designed to take the focus off the teacher and his/her procedures and put it on the students and the content.  The chapter on cooperative learning is one of the best and most practical I have seen.  A lot of books talk about these topics in a theoretical manner, Wong breaks them down into doable tasks.	2002-01-10

All the positive things the other reviews say about the book are true--wonderful, bright, engaging illustrations, good message overall.  I think this book might be helpful for kids who are like Velvet if they are having trouble with teasing at school.  But if they're not, why tempt fate?  I found it annoying that &quot;odd&quot; was the continual word used to describe this little girl who has simple tastes, is not caught up in our materialistic consumer culture, finds joy in life's natural beauty, is warm and friendly, and has a positive self image.  Why put the idea into young kids' minds that this is odd behavior!  I find nothing &quot;odd&quot; about it, and so I didn't appreciate the subliminal affect of the &quot;odd&quot; moniker being repeated over and over.  I'm sure this wasn't the author's intent, quite the opposite.  I may be wrong, the book might be an excellent tool for supporting kids who are feeling &quot;odd&quot; in comparison with their peers.  I didn't &quot;field test&quot; the book.  It might encourage and reinforce Velvet's unique perspective on life.

This book features two seminal kid pleasers--animals and trains.  I am a teacher who has read the book to dozens of children who have really enjoyed it.  I would like to defend it agains the &quot;dark&quot; criticism.  In my experience, children haven't been scared, upset or bothered by the story or the illustrations.  They have been empathetic however, and perhaps that bothers some adults. The illustrations are lovely, misty, giving a feeling of riding the train out at sunset around the world.  The little boy hero of the story has fun, whimsical adventures with all of the animals.  My experience with kids is that they like the illustrations and smile when when they discover an interesting detail hidden in the mist.  The story has a positive message--the little boy finds room on his train for all the animals, and they end up at his house.  Perhaps the ending is simplistic and overly optomistic for some, but it's a little kids fantasy story! I believe the underlying message is positive and possible, that we can make room in our lives to exist in peace with all G-d's creatures.  I have had kids act out this story as a skit and make animal cosutmes, and they had a ball doing that.  Also, kids could make up other adventures for the little boy and his train, involving other endangered animals.  One of the best books I have found for young kids that tells about endangered species in a poetic way, which helps them understand the basic concepts involved.  Again, it is simplistic, but this book is for pre-schoolers and early elementary kids who are just being introduced to the topic.  Although the third and fourth graders who did the skit liked it as well!  It could spark discussions with kids about what's really going on in the world with endagered species, and what people can or should do about it, but that's our job as parents and teachers, to help kids cope with and understand life with all it's highs and low and contradictions.	2001-12-07
US	52696415	R27XERXPBZNZEG	068808740X	72902260	The Story of Jumping Mouse	Books	5	43	47	N	Y	More for adults	I'm a teacher and I have read this book with great personal enthusiasm to lots of kids, and I have to tell you that they are not all that enamoured with it.  It is a story with a deep meaning that kids usually don't &quot;get&quot; and are not necessarily ready for at a young age.  The subtle plot and pictures doen't seem to hold younger kid's interest and attention.  Now, having said that, I absolutely love this book and find that many adults do too.  I was first introduced to the &quot;Jumping Mouse&quot; story in my twenties, (20 years ago), and it literally changed my life.  It is a very moving tale about spiritual seeking and spiritual growth, really about life's journey itself.  The illustrations in this book are unique and gorgeous.  A nice book to give as a gift to friends who are spiritually oriented and like Native American perspectives.  Some kids may like the book, especailly those who are interested in the themes presented.  Could be used as a teaching book for kids and adults in a spiritual setting, but I don't recommend it as a fun kids' read-aloud.	2001-11-26

Their discussion of the situation in the middle east offers a much needed window on the spiritual dimensions of the problem of believing that violence ever ultimately solves anything.  I would recommend this book to anyone seeking spiritual guidance and salve during this difficult time after the World Trade Center attack.  Nhat Hahn is very task oriented, Berrigan very heart oriented, a great mix.  It is a true ecumenical dialog, which enlightens.	2001-10-08
US	52696415	R2JI561JG1613A	0385496206	995930412	Dating Secrets of the Ten Commandments	Books	4	11	11	N	N	Something of value even for &quot;non daters&quot;	I picked this book up only because of the odd juxtaposition of the two concepts in the title.  It has many good tips for guiding you towards more fulfilling relationships in general, not just with your &quot;date.&quot;  It made me appreciate and see the commandments in a whole new way.  I concur with the other reviewer that there is too much schtick in the book.  I enjoyed the some of the humor, and it did make certain points hit home.  However after a while it got repetetive and distracting.  If you can ignore the irrelevant jokes, you can find some real gems of spiritual advice for guiding your life based on the big 10.  I would especially recommend this book to a guy who is looking for a meaningful relationship with a woman, perhaps leading to marriage.  This answers the question, &quot;What do women want?&quot;	2001-03-17

The characters are fun and whimsical, kids can relate to them.  The message is positive and empowering--kids come up with compromises and solutions to problems.  And it has a subtle anti-sexist message without being overpowering and pedantic in its political correctness.  Micheal Bird Boy and Boss Lady both seem comfortable in their own unique skin, and that's also a great message for kids.  This is a fine example of a pre-k/early elem. book that shows environmental action in a positive light.  A nice gift for the Micheals in your life!	2000-10-06

The style is simple and easy to  use.  Each page has a clear, concise yoga tip, and the inspirational quotes  sprinkled throughout are a wonderful compliment to the highly practical  content.  One of the best things about this book is that it is elegant--a  finely crafted hardbound book with unique illustrations and a small cozy  size that feels fun to hold.  The book can be easily tucked away anywhere  in the office, or toted along in a briefcase or knapsack.  This would make  a perfect pick-me-up gift for a friend or office co-worker. &quot;Office  Yoga&quot; would be just the thing to include in a stress relief care  basket.	2000-08-21
