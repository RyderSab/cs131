I have several different Indian cookbooks, and this is the only one I have found practical enough for everyday use. The first time I made an Indian dinner, I visited an Indian grocery store to get the 4 or 5 ingredients (spices) that weren't readily available at my usual grocery store, but these &quot;unusual&quot; ingredients are called for in almost every recipe, so I can use them over and over again--they are called for in almost all the recipes. And unlike my other Indian cookbooks, I don't need to buy a bunch of different spices for each recipe; the basic menu of spices is used over and over again. <br />  <br /> I have found every recipe to be delicious and easy to cook. Indian food used to be a treat we had only at restaurants, but now it is something we eat regularly at home.	2004-08-01

As a beginning gardener with a large garden to plan, I've found this book to be a wonderful inspiration and a good gardening resource. My idea of low-maintenance is NO maintenance, and that's pretty much the idea behind this book (although the soil preparation required can be quite extensive). I return to this book whenever I need to be reminded that a garden can be beautiful without being rigidly planned.<br />The only weakness is that the plant lists include only true Mediterranean plants, rather than including other plants (for example, plants native to Southern California) that meet the criteria for drought-resistance and low-maintenance.	2002-10-20

Set in 1923 England, this series follows the adventures of the Honorable Daisy Dalrymple, a young woman who has defied convention by choosing to make her own living (as a journalist) rather than let her aristocratic family support her.<br />In this, the sixth of the series (preceded by \\"Damsel in Distress\\" and followed by \\"Styx and Stones\\"), Daisy visits relatives at Henley-on-Thames while researching her latest writing assignment, an article on the Henley Royal Regatta. Daisy's relatives' house is packed to the gills with people in town for the Regatta, including the rowing team from Oxford's Ambrose College, who will compete. Needless to say, there is lots of friction between all these people for a variety of reasons, and eventually, one of the rowing team turns up dead just in time to spoil Daisy's weekend plans with her fiance, Detective Chief Inspector Alec Fletcher of Scotland Yard.<br />This book is not quite up to the high standards of the others in this series because the suspects all blur together so easily. The individual members of the rowing team all seem more or less the same and are, as far as the reader is concerned, easily dismissed as true suspects. There are only four or so characters truly depicted in-depth, so it becomes very clear that one of them must be the murderer. This is not how a mystery reader likes to solve the mystery.<br />The recurring characters, however, are as well done and enjoyable as ever, and the little jealousies between the newly engaged Alec and Daisy are fun. Once again, Dunn has created a clever and realistic \\"set-up\\" for the mystery, and her depiction of time and place cannot be beat.	2002-07-07

Set in 1923 England, this series follows the adventures of the Honorable Daisy Dalrymple, a young woman who has defied convention by choosing to make her own living (as a journalist) rather than let her aristocratic family support her.<br />When Phillip Petries American fiancé is kidnapped and held for ransom, Phillip turns to his good friend Daisy for help. Daisys penchant for crime-solving insures her willingness to help her old friend, but she finds herself caught between a rock and a hard place when Phillip asks her not to involve the police. Daisys romance with Detective Chief Inspector Alec Fletcher of Scotland Yard, a widower with a young daughter, certainly makes this dictate difficult to follow. <br />This is the fifth of the series (preceded by Murder on the Flying Scotsman and followed by Dead in the Water), and although the characters and setting remain as charming as ever, there is not much mystery solving to be had. The perpetrator of the kidnapping is obvious very early on, but the plot revolves more around rescuing the fiancé than solving a crime. The story is best described as a caper, with lots of following of suspects, traveling around the countryside, and a climactic shoot-out. Readers who like to decipher clues and try to solve the mystery themselves will be disappointed.	2002-03-07

This is the third in Tim Cockey's \\"hearse\\" series, and it's far and away the best. It has all the humor and attitude of the first two, but here Cockey shows us he can serve up a great mystery too.<br />Hitchcock (&quot;Hitch&quot;) Sewell is a thirtysomething undertaker, surely one of Baltimore's most eligible bachelors. When his good friend Lucy is accused of killing her boyfriend, he sets out to find the real killer. As a truly amateur sleuth, Hitch counts himself lucky when he meets Pete Munger, a bona fide private investigator (unfortunately suffering from a midlife crisis). Together, these two will bring a killer to justice.<br />This is an intricate mystery, with almost every character having a strong motive. There are twists and turns galore, and at the center of it all is Hitch, whose ironic sense of humor and quick turn of phrase have made this series a continuing delight. The addition of Pete Munger to this series provides a dour counterpoint to Hitch's carefree jesting. I hope and pray Munger is a permanent addition. These two have the makings of a great mystery-solving pair.	2002-03-07

These books are supposedly Austen's \\"discovered diaries\\" edited by Barron, whose explanatory footnotes help the reader better understand the time period and locale.<br />This episode finds Jane in Southampton in 1807. Her brother Frank, a post captain in the Royal Navy, is convinced that his good friend Tom Seagrave, a captain who stands accused of violating the Articles of War (the punishment for which is death), is innocent. Jane becomes convinced as well, and together, they set out to prove it. Their conviction takes them from Southampton's finest homes to its darkest slums, from the sickroom of French prisoners of war to the discovery of espionage and finally, a revelation of ultimate betrayal.<br />Barron shows herself to be a master of plot here, as a tangled (but never convoluted) web of intrigue and revenge is slowly revealed. The many characters and motivations are complex and fully drawn, and Jane's enthusiasm for the Navy gives us a glimpse into a time when military service could mean the making of a fortune.<br />I'm not an Austen scholar, but I am an Austen fan, and I enjoy the entire series for the way it evokes Austen's sly sense of humor in reporting the events and people that surround her. The only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars is that I was able to solve the mystery myself.	2002-01-20

I think one of the characteristics of mystery fans, besides a love of puzzle solving, is a genuine interest in other people, cultures, societies, worlds, etc. Why else would the mystery genre be so popular? We don't read mysteries simply to solve crimes; we read to meet new people, explore new places, and experience the unknown.<br />Deborah Morgan's new \\"Antique Lover's\\" series is a shining example of what the mystery genre has to offer. Her sleuth, Jeff Talbot, is a \\"picker,\\" someone who patrols garage and estate sales, looking for bargain antiques to sell to antique dealers. Talbot's enthusiasm for his job, his delight in discovering a hidden treasure in someone's attic, is tempered by the dog-eat-dog nature of the business. His chief rival is Frank Hamilton, a hot-tempered picker with a bullying nature and a lack of scruples. A run-in with Hamilton is enough to spoil Talbot's entire day.<br />When Hamilton turns up dead at an auction in Michigan, an auction that Talbot is also attending, Talbot fears he is the chief suspect. But as a former FBI agent, he is in the position to call in some favors and do some sleuthing of his own. In the intimate world of antique collectors, Talbot soon discovers that Hamilton had many enemies and conspirators with both motive and opportunity. Can Talbot catch the murderer AND obtain the prize antique tea set that is the auction's focal point?<br />I found this mystery to be thoroughly enjoyable, like stepping into a foreign world where everything is unfamiliar and fascinating. Talbot leads a truly unusual life, living in a mansion filled with antiques, employing a butler to keep things running smoothly, and living with a wife whose agoraphobia keeps her confined to the house (and prevents her from traveling with Jeff). Setting the auction on Mackinac Island in Michigan is an additional stroke of genius and lets the author take the reader into yet another world, where cars are prohibited and jackets required after 6 p.m.<br />Themystery itself is engaging, although the denouement involves many sudden revelations (this is a pet peeve of mine since it prohibits the reader from solving the mystery herself). The setting is undoubtedly the central delight of this book, but it is so compelling that it compensates for the slight weakness of plot. I eagerly await the next installment.	2001-11-25

The China Bayles series offers the best of all worlds for mystery fans. China herself is no nonsense and tough talking (she calls her husband by his last name), with a background in criminal law and a circle of friends that include police chiefs, sheriffs, and Texas Rangers. But she's put the dog-eat-dog business world behind her to run an herb shop in the small Texas town of Pecan Springs, and she's just recently opened a tearoom with her best friend, Ruby.<br />With Christmas approaching, business is booming, but then things start to go awry. China's mistletoe supplier, Carl Swenson, turns up dead by the side of the road, the victim of an apparent hit-and-run. The main suspects are Carl's next-door neighbors, the two Fletcher sisters, who happen to be China's good friends. And on top of all that, China's friendship with Ruby is suddenly strained by Ruby's odd behavior and insistence that nothing is wrong.<br />This is an interesting mystery, with ample subplots and characters to keep a reader on her toes. China is a complicated character, and her life in Pecan Springs is fun to read about. This is the ninth book in the series (preceded by Lavender Lies), but Albert does an excellent job of making China's recurring involvement with mystery solving plausible. (It's difficult for long-running series to keep their amateur sleuths stumbling over crime in a realistic manner. Most authors don't manage it very well.)<br />A thoroughly enjoyable Christmas mystery.	2001-10-01

If you just bought yourself a big empty lot and will be designing and building your house and garden, this is the perfect book for you. For the rest of us with small, non-rectangular lots and existing houses, this book is useless.<br />I've never understood why so many people have a hard time understanding feng shui, but reading this book illuminated me. My interest in feng shui comes from Karen Rauch Carter and Terah Kathryn Collins, both of whom take ancient philosophies and practically and usefully apply them to Western culture. Lillian Too's feng shui seems to me to be so rigid as to be impossible for the majority of us to implement.<br />For example, this book advises that water elements (ponds, fountains) should go on the north side of your property. Well, that's not where I want (or have room) for my fountain. I want a fountain--where else can I put it? This book doesn't say, leaving me with the impression I'm courting feng shui disaster to place a fountain anywhere else in my yard.<br />This book also advises that palm trees, because of their height and the shape of their leaves, are dangerous to have anywhere around your home. As a Southern Californian, I find this very hard to believe. I also don't care for the assertion that cacti and other desert plants are dry and &quot;dead&quot; and therefore bad to have in my garden. Am I supposed to purchase only those plants that grow in China, regardless of my own climate and soil conditions?<br />I had hoped to obtain some sound advice to help me design my garden, but this book is filled with inflexible dictates rather than helpful guidelines. There aren't many feng shui gardening books out there, but I'll wait for a good one to be published. I got my money back for this one.	2001-08-11

Set in 1923 England, this series follows the adventures of the Honorable Daisy Dalrymple, a young woman who has defied convention by choosing to make her own living (as a journalist) rather than let her aristocratic family support her. Her friendship with Detective Chief Inspector Alec Fletcher of Scotland Yard, a widower, has progressed to the point that Daisy has been to his home to meet his disapproving mother and his doting young daughter, Belinda.<br />In this, the fourth of the series (preceded by \\"Requiem for a Mezzo\\" and followed by \\"Damsel in Distress\\"), we find Daisy taking the London-to-Edinburgh express, where she runs into an old school friend and her contentious family, all squabbling over the distribution of an impending inheritance. On top of that, Daisy must contend with Belinda, who has stowed away on the train after a fight with her grandmother. When Belinda discovers one of the cantankerous family members dead in his compartment, Daisy has her hands full watching over the young girl and trying to solve a murder.<br />One of the things I love about this series is the way Dunn avoids the traps that plague so many series writers. In particular, the &quot;set up&quot; of each mystery, and how Daisy AND Alec get involved, feels very genuine, not contrived at all. I dread mysteries where the heroine and the cop keep bumping into each other through a series of unlikely coincidences. Having Daisy call Alec and asking him to get involved is practical and realistic.<br />I also enjoy that Daisy is interested in solving the mysteries without being a nosy busybody; she simply finds herself in the middle of it all. She relies on Alec (rather than thinking she can handle things herself). He trusts her input (rather than dismissing her ideas).<br />I'm a fan of the entire series, and this one has a solid plot that keeps you guessing.	2001-07-17

Miss Magdalena Yoder is the innkeeper of the chi chi PennDutch Inn in southern Pennsylvania. Here you pay through the nose for the spartan furnishings, simple food, and the privilege of cleaning your own room. It's all in the name of atmosphere-the 43-year-old Miss Yoder is a Mennonite, and her farm (the legacy left by her parents' sudden death 10 years ago) is now an inn with the longest waiting list in the state.<br />With a client list that reads like People magazine, Magdalena has her hands full keeping the inn running smoothly. Her sister Susannah is too busy staying out late and (gasp!) putting on makeup to be of much help, and Magdalena's cantankerous cook is prone to quitting every day or so. When an ambitious congressman comes to the inn for the start of deer hunting season, followed by a group of animal rights protestors, Magdalena thinks she might be in over her head. But it's not until a body turns up that she realizes just how out of hand things can get. With the reputation of her inn at stake, Magdalena sets out to find a killer.<br />Magdalena is a wonderful character. She's irreverent at the same time she is true to her Mennonite upbringing. Her shock at her sister's behavior (and the behavior of the English) is truly reflective of this different culture. At the same time, she yearns to travel, she's not too pious to sneak a peak at the television every now and then, and she's been known to let slip a rude remark when provoked.<br />Better yet, Myers is a fun and savvy writer, someone to read closely. Look for her description of \\"Tammy Myers,\\" the chief of police's wife. There's also a character named Dorothy Gillman, and a reference to Poe's \\"The Purloined Letter,\\" which is also the name of the newsletter for the High Crimes Mystery Bookshop in Boulder, Colorado. I'm sure a close reader will discover more treats for the avid mystery fan.<br />But best of all, read closely and you will enjoy Myers' subtle sense of humor as much as her overt one. TheAmish Lifestyle Plan Option is abbreviated ALPO. One character belongs to the New Age Church of Holistic Oneness (NACHO), and the animal rights group is the Animal Parity Endowment Society (APES).<br />My only complaint is that the resolution to the mystery is a bit weak-the reader is never provided all the clues that help to solve the case, and things wrap up a bit too quickly. Still, Miss Yoder is a wonderful addition to the world of amateur sleuths, and the book even comes with recipes. Who could ask for more?	2001-07-08

Theodosia Browning is the 36-year-old owner of the Indigo Tea Shop in Charleston, South Carolina. Having abandoned her high profile, high intensity career as an advertiser, Theo now enjoys the joys and challenges of running her own small business in Charleston's historic district. With her dog, Earl Grey, and her little apartment over her tea shop, Theo cherishes her new life in the slow lane.<br />Her serenity is marred, however, when the city's most hated man-a developer with an eye toward tarnishing the purity of the historic district-is found dead after drinking some of Theo's specially blended tea. Theo and her employees are all suspect, and to save her good name, not to mention her business, Theo sets out to solve the mystery of his death.<br />This is a charming book, for mystery lovers and tea drinkers alike. The author takes you inside the world of tea specialists, as well as the small community of business owners that comprise Charleston's historic district. Theo and her friends are comfortably familiar, and the book is a quick, enjoyable read.<br />Most importantly, Childs lets the mystery drive the story. The details of tea making and the atmosphere of Charleston are supplements to the plot, as they should be. The mystery has some weaknesses, but the characters and setting more than compensate. Read this book when you're in the mood for something light and fun.	2001-07-07

Seeing that other reviewers of this book enjoyed it so much more than I did gave me pause (although it hasn't effected my rating). I will add this caveat to my review: I read this book over several weeks and was unable, due to my work schedule, to read more than a chapter at a time. This is not how I prefer to read.<br />That having been said, I did not care for this book, and I had greatly enjoyed the first one, &quot;Dead Cat Bounce.&quot; (The next in this series is &quot;Wicked Fix.&quot;) Everything that was charming in the first book seemed trite and overdone in this one.<br />Retired Wall Street finance wizard Jacobia Tiptree and her son, Sam, are outsiders in the seacoast village of Eastport, Maine, but they have made their home there and settled into the community. When a local ne'er-do-well is found murdered, Jacobia and her best friend Ellie investigate.<br />I found very little to be believable in this book; nothing rang true. The &quot;ghost&quot; in Jacobia's house keeps moving a spoon around--Jacobia finds this profoundly meaningful, and I found it distracting. Jacobia's ex-husband has apparently engaged in borderline psychotic behavior in the past (faking heart attacks, mailing dead things to people, etc.), but this is described as typical ex-husband behavior, and Jacobia has no fears for her own safety or her son's. Although Ellie is Jacobia's closest friend, we never get any insight into her personality or actions. She is simply a typical (stereotypical) reserved native of Maine--this is supposed to be sufficient to explain all her actions.<br />The descriptions of life in Eastport eventually overshadow the plot of the book, and the reader is treated to long passages describing shops and houses and people that have nothing to do with the plot. Evoking a nice sense of setting is one thing; writing a travelogue is another.<br />But most of all, I found the resolution to the mystery to be convoluted and poorly depicted. Despite an action-packed chasescene involving boats, the majority of the denoument occurs verbally, as everything &quot;suddenly falls into place&quot; and Jacobia and Ellie blurt out the solution to every little inconsistency that has occurred in the town over the past several weeks. &quot;And then this happened...and then this happened...and then this happened...&quot; The reader is inundated with sudden resolutions. There is no sense of &quot;fair play&quot; whereby the reader might have solved the crime for him- or herself beforehand.<br />Still, I enjoy this character (although I wish her ex-husband would disappear from the series), her son, and the setting, and I hope to enjoy the next book in this series as much as I enjoyed the previous.	2001-05-25

Imagine a world where even the slightest hint of scandal can ruin a woman's chance for marriage, where having one's name in the newspaper is tantamount to social ruin, and where one is considered a \\"spinster\\" by the age of 35.<br />Enter the world of the Boston Brahmin, the gentry that comprise Boston's high society, the \\"old money\\" whose connections and ancestry define their social status. Addington and Caroline Ames, brother and sister, are members of this class and subject to its rules and dictates. When their young cousin, Valentine Thorne, is threatened with blackmail by the unscrupulous Colonel Mann (a publisher whose gossip sheet reveals the secrets of those who refuse to meet his blackmail demands), Addington goes to confront the Colonel, only to find him dead. Unfortunately, the packet of letters that were used to blackmail Valentine are also missing, so Addington and Caroline set out to find the letters and perhaps, along the way, a killer.<br />This is a wonderful mystery, rich in detail and atmosphere. The book is subtitled, \\"A Beacon Hill Mystery\\" (as opposed to, for example, \\"An Addington Ames Mystery\\"). This is no accident, for the story is told from varying viewpoints, allowing the reader to experience the full range of Boston society. Addington and Caroline, both members of the upper class, nevertheless are consigned to strict gender roles and societal expectations. Their boarder, Dr. MacKenzie, is a stranger to Boston's rigid caste system-through him we experience Boston as a newcomer. Valentine, much younger than her Ames cousins, is of a marriable age and more susceptible to the threat of scandal. Each of these characters is fully developed, with their own separate concerns, motives, and relationships between and amongst each other.<br />The mystery plot is complex and executed well (although it does seem that everyone in Boston has a scandal to hide). There are many characters to track, but the author does a good job of reminding the reader whoeverybody is and how they fit in with one another.<br />The next in this series is \\"Murder at Bertram's Bower.\\"	2001-04-01

It's easy to summarize this series as featuring an undertaker sleuth, but this is a surprisingly upbeat and laugh-out-loud debut mystery.<br />Hitchcock (\\"Hitch\\") Sewell is not merely an undertaker, he's a 34-year-old, attractive, eligible undertaker in the Fells Point neighborhood in Baltimore. Continuing the family funeral business with his aunt, Hitch has plenty of time to indulge in his hobbies: drinking at the local bar and acting in amateur theatre with his sexy ex-wife, Julia. But mortuary work does bring one into contact with the recently dead, and Hitch is just the sort of man to get involved when suspicious circumstances complicate one's exit from this earth.<br />What makes this book so fun and charming is Hitchcock himself. His wry observations will make you laugh out loud, and there are some lively characters populating his neighborhood to spice up the story. Hitch is an interesting man, refreshingly complex. He's interested in a beautiful woman without being sexist, and he doesn't shy away from a fight, although he's no swaggering bully. His on-going flirtation with his ex-wife is a bit of a cliché in this genre, but a forgivable one.<br />The only drawback is that Hitch is not a very active sleuth in this novel; he's more an observer of other people's sleuthing, managing to be in the right place at the right time fairly frequently. This doesn't diminish the fun in any way, but it does leave the avid mystery reader feeling a little empty. Like Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series, the plot is tangential to the real stars, the characters.<br />The next in this series is \\"Hearse of a Different Color.\\"	2001-03-24

I liked this book a lot more than its prequel, \\"Larger Than Death,\\" and I'm hopeful that the next title will be even better. Jo Fuller, the plus-sized heroine, has all the makings of a wonderful series sleuth, but her potential is not yet realized in this over plotted yet under-developed mystery.<br />Still reeling from the unexpected death of her best friend, Jo returns to work investigating and recommending grant recipients for her wealthy employer, Alicia Madrone. This time, however, Mrs. Madrone asks Jo to investigate the estranged daughter of an old family friend, Sally Rhymer. Sally is fearful that her daughter has fallen in with people who will take advantage of her (a \\"new age\\" group that provides grief counseling). Jo's investigation becomes complicated when Sally's ex-husband, the Admiral, is kidnapped.<br />A lot goes on in this book, and most of it holds together pretty well. A side plot involving a previous employee of Mrs. Madrone's is simply extraneous. The main problem is that the vast majority of the characters are under-developed stereotypes that border on campy. Mrs. Madrone is aged, eccentric, and in a wheelchair. Her devoted servant Ambrose is fastidious, red-haired, and gay. All the military characters (and there's a lot of them; the story is set in San Diego) are dangerous or sexist (or both). There's a foreign, lesbian artist habitually panting in her lover's ear. Even Jo, although confident and witty, seems sketchily drawn. Murray inadvertently makes Jo's weight her defining characteristic, even though the character herself would hate to be so defined.<br />Two things kept me from enjoying this book more. (1) As in the previous novel, Jo remains romantically involved with her dead best friend's lover (granted, he seems pretty conflicted about this). I think the point of their relationship is supposed to be that large people can be overtly sexual, but I find the relationship to be off-putting. The friend has been dead only one month. (2) Murray is unnecessarily disdainful of the \\"new age\\" group without providing sufficient cause. San Diego abounds with such groups, and it misrepresents the city to make them seem sneaky and shady for no good reason (i.e., a reason that has to do with the plot of the book).<br />Nevertheless, I enjoy reading mystery authors who are learning their craft and getting better all the time, as is Lynne Murray. I look forward to the next entry in this series.	2001-02-27

I was absolutely stumped from beginning to end, but when I read the solution, everything made sense and fit together nicely. Best of all, when I look back over the story, I see that Barr provided the reader with all the necessary clues along the way. I just didn't have the brain power to figure it out myself.<br />Park Ranger Anna Pigeon is a fascinating character, and the &quot;hook&quot; of this series--each book takes place at a different national park--is absolutely unique (that's saying something when I can name not one, but TWO mystery series featuring cleaning lady sleuths, of all things). Pigeon is a loner, a woman who has to remind herself to fake softness and sympathy when required. She is completely at home hiking and camping in the great outdoors.<br />This book finds her faith in nature shaken, however, when she is attacked by a grizzly bear while working with researchers to gather bear DNA information in Waterton/ Glacier National Peace Park. When one of her companions goes missing after the attack, and then a camper is found murdered off a nearby trail, Anna finds her darkest suspicions aroused.<br />Although I would recommend this series, and this book in particular, to anyone, it is a particular treat for anyone who enjoys camping or hiking. Barr's detailed description of life within the National Park system is engrossing. These people have chosen lives that are completely at odds from everyday existence as most of us experience it. And if you don't enjoy camping or hiking, you can still enter and enjoy this foreign world without having to experience the inconvenience of mosquitos directly, not to mention the terror of a grizzly attack.	2001-02-19

Reading this book was like running into an old friend and discovering the friendship still vibrant and alive. After some of Perry's recent, less-than-stellar efforts, this book showcases her mastery of the intricate plot, compelling characters, and flawless historical description (London 1892).<br />This book finds Superintendent Thomas Pitt paying the price for his discovery of a murder (and subsequent identification of the murderer, despite the lack of a motive) that was meant to look like an accident. Having foiled the malevolent Inner Circle (a secret society of powerful men who protect one another and scheme to control the country) once too often, Pitt finds himself demoted to working undercover in the slums of East End, separated from his family and embroiled in danger and revolution.<br />His wife, Charlotte, and their maid, Gracie, in an effort to restore Pitt's reputation, set out to discover the motive for murder, the one aspect of the case Pitt was unable to unearth. They enlist the help of Sergeant Tellman, loyal to Pitt and even more so to Gracie, to help them discover the truth. In the meantime, Pitt finds himself deeper and deeper in political intrigue, with no one to trust with what he discovers.<br />As the title suggests, the murders of Jack the Ripper come to play a role in the plot, as do the excesses of the monarchy, the recklessness of tabloid journalism, the virtues and evils of the status quo, and the price one is willing to pay for political gains. At its heart, this book asks, do the ends ever justify the means? It is to Perry's credit that she does not attempt a pat answer to this provocative question.<br />The increasing involvement of Gracie and Tellman in the Pitt series adds a welcome vibrancy to the otherwise stark tale. Watching these two stumble over their own feelings is a wonderful reminder that even in times of chaos and terror, the human heart dares to hope and dream. Perry has introduced and developedmany side characters in this series over the years, but Gracie and Tellman are not only the most enjoyable, their involvement in solving the mystery adds a fresh and interesting element to the mix. I look forward to their continued involvement.<br />This is not so much a mystery as it is a political thriller, but mystery fans should enjoy it just the same. Perry provides a neat and credible solution to the Ripper murders, but cleverly leaves open the possibility that her solution is untrue. The story is told through varying perspectives--Pitt, Charlotte, Tellman, Gracie, Aunt Vespasia--as each person gathers information, but the solution to the mystery is never obvious.<br />My faith in Anne Perry is restored.	2001-02-17

The only reason I read this book is because it's by Anne Perry, whose earlier fiction I greatly admire but whose writing has let me down IMMENSELY over the past few years. I'd hoped this &quot;novella,&quot; a departure from her two mystery series, would represent a return to the compelling story-telling I used to associate with Perry. Alas, it does not.<br />This is a short story, not a novella (barely 70 pages with large print, wide margins, and small pages). The characters are like stick figures, with no past or personality to explain their actions. The plot careens around and through historical figures and events without touching them--Perry seems to have chosen to set the story in 1792 Paris because the time period interested her, not because it has much to do with the plot. In fact, without the description of historical events, this wouldn't even pass muster as a short story.<br />As a reader extremely familiar with Perry's thought process, I saw the &quot;surprise&quot; ending coming miles away. The only saving grace to this story is that you can read it and be done with it in one sitting.	2001-01-27

Set in 1923 England, this series follows the adventures of the Honorable Daisy Dalrymple, a young woman who has defied convention by choosing to make her own living (as a journalist) rather than let her aristocratic family support her. And her growing friendship with Detective Chief Inspector Alec Fletcher of Scotland Yard, a man decidedly NOT of her class, is a bone of contention between Daisy and her friends.<br />In this, the third of the series (preceded by \\"The Winter Garden Mystery\\" and followed by \\"Murder on the Flying Scotsman\\"), we get a glimpse of Daisy's home life in the Chelsea section of London. Friendly with her next-door neighbors, Daisy accepts their invitation to a concert where they will be singing. When one of them dies in the middle of the concert, Daisy and Alec find themselves, once again, investigating murder.<br />This is an extremely enjoyable and well-done series, and Dunn is adept at creating a compelling portrait of time and place. There's plenty of mystery to spare in this one, with more suspects and clues than Alec and Daisy know what to do with (though the scene in which suspect after suspect confides in Daisy is a bit overdone). It's also refreshing that the \\"set-up\\" is so different than in the first two books-instead of sending Daisy on yet another writing assignment at a country manor, Dunn keeps her in London.<br />This is a charming series, and this book is a strong addition to it.	2001-01-09

The &quot;Susanna, Lady Appleton&quot; series is set in Elizabethan England. Lady Susanna Appleton is a shrewd, intelligent woman with a love of herbal studies and an uncomfortable arranged marriage to an &quot;intelligence gatherer&quot; for the crown. Lord Robert Appleton believes that a woman should be biddable and follow the guidance of her husband. He is also an indiscreet philanderer, as Susanna is all too aware.<br />When a woman arrives unannounced at the Appletons' temporary residence in London, Susanna assumes she is another mistress of Robert's. When the woman is later discovered murdered in an alley, Susanna's sense of justice (and her need to absolve her husband of the crime) leads her to investigate. She soon discovers a pattern of killing that indicates more women will be murdered.<br />Susanna is a well-drawn, enjoyable character whose strong sense of self is never corrupted by her tenuous relationship with her husband. Their interactions are always interesting and frustrating--as Susanna herself observes, theirs could have been a true match of equals were Robert ever to feel at ease with Susanna's independence. Unfortunately, he is a product of his times, and the couple is destined for unhappiness.<br />The mystery is well done, as Susanna tracks a serial killer through the brothels of London. The ending is a little too tidy and resolved a bit too quickly, but all the clues were in place well before the resolution. I didn't feel surprised about the ending, but neither did I see it coming.<br />Lord Robert's work as a spy keeps Susanna realistically involved with court intrigues, so her involvement with the mysteries doesn't yet feel forced (a problem that eventually plagues most series featuring amateur sleuths). I hope the author can keep it up.<br />This is the third in this excellent series, which begins with &quot;Face Down Upon an Herbal&quot; and is followed by &quot;Face Down in the Marrow-Bone Pie.&quot;	2000-12-17

This is a really enjoyable mystery from the author of the popular Amanda Pepper mystery series. &quot;Time and Trouble&quot; is darker, edgier, better written, and more tightly plotted than any of the Amanda Pepper books, and I hope this is the first in a new series from Roberts.<br />Emma Howe is a crusty old P.I. whose unapologetically blunt demeanor repels her employees; she's gone through seven detective trainees in less than three years. Enter Billie August, a young, pretty single mom desperate for a steady income and a mental challenge. Theirs is a match made in hell--Billie's naive earnestness and Emma's been-there-done-that coldness bring out the worst in the other. After Billie botches her first case, their partnership seems doomed.<br />Billie is given a second chance, however, when the Howe Agency is asked to locate a teenage runaway. Learning as she goes, Billie soon finds herself involved in something far more complex--and dangerous--than she imagined.<br />These two characters are marvelous depicted; each is so distinctive, complex, and fully portrayed. The reader completely understands Emma's irritation with Billie and Billie's frustration with Emma--each person is so convinced the other is a big pain. Kudos to Roberts for creating a relationship that is so fresh and interesting.<br />The plot is satisfyingly complex. Another reviewer complained of &quot;coincidences,&quot; but I did not think these strained credulity. I read stranger things in the newspaper every day.<br />I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading the next in the series.	2000-12-07

This tactic really illustrates what a difference accessories can make. It also makes me look at my own wardrobe and think how I can achieve different &quot;looks&quot; with accessories rather than buying different clothes.<br />The other gem of this book is the accessory checklist at the back of the book, divided into categories: basic gear, ornamentation, work, evening, summer, and winter.

USELESS! Not to mention impractical for those of us with tight budgets and/or a disinclination to spend obscene amounts of money.<br />I am not too adept with accessories, but I have a pretty solid wardrobe for both work and casual wear.

I'm a big fan of this series, which features widowed bookstore owner Claire Malloy, and I have been eagerly awaiting this latest entry for some time. Although it was enjoyable to visit with these characters again, the laughs were fewer and farther between than I'm used to from this writer, and the mystery was quite a let-down.<br />The titular &quot;convention&quot; is a mystery convention with five major mystery writers arrived in Farberville from out of town. Claire, who hopes to make a small fortune in book sales during the convention, ends up in charge when the organizer is hospitalized. Between herding the errant authors from one place to the next while keeping track of her own teenage daughter, Claire hardly has time to rebuff the apologetic overtures of her estranged boyfriend, Lieutenant Peter Rosen. But convention chaos becomes the least of Claire's worries when a conference attendee dies under suspicious circumstances.<br />There's a lot of Hess's trademark charm in this book, including the characterization of the mystery authors, each a unique and interesting personality. Claire is a wonderful character, and her relationship with her daughter is fun and realistic.<br />Unfortunately, the plot just isn't strong enough. Hess goes to a great deal of trouble to depict the complex and frequently hostile relationships between the authors, even though these relationships have very little to do with the mystery. The resolution of the mystery is startlingly weak and poorly thought out. And the bizarre subplot involving Peter Rosen, which is presumably meant to be humorous, is so far out of character as to be contrived and distracting. Hess doesn't need to work this hard for laughs.<br />Despite the disappointing ending to this book, I hope I don't have to wait too long for the next Claire Malloy mystery.	2000-11-02

Jane is a complex character, frustrated on the one hand by the limitations society places on her as a woman, and completely unaware on the other hand of her own biases towards members of the &quot;lower&quot; classes. Her sharp wit and keen observing eye make her an ideal sleuth.<br />Jane's trip through the Derbyshire countryside with her cousin is marred by the discovery of a mutilated body, that of Tess Arnold, the stillroom maid at a local estate. A &quot;stillroom maid&quot; is a sort of healer, an herbalist, employed by a family for their own treatment, but also free to sell medicines to local townspeople. The more Jane discovers about the maid and the estate where she worked, the more tangled the web of mystery surrounding her death becomes.<br />Ultimately, the web proves too convoluted. The solution to the murder and the revelations of the last 15 pages of the novel stretch the abilities of even a close reader, and how Jane solves the mystery is not satisfactorily explained. Another death near the end of the book borders on inexplicable (or at least, too hastily explained).<br />A final note to Ms. Barron: as long as you are fictionalizing Jane Austen's life, you might consider allowing Jane a little requited love in her life, for the sake of your readers.	2000-10-22

Sadly, I'll be returning this title and looking for something more informative.<br />Although this book does teach you how to use FrontPage in the most basic possible way, it does not cover some very fundamental topics. For one thing, the author recommends using readymade (albeit customize-able) &quot;themes&quot; to design your site, with little information on how to format if you're NOT using a theme. The author also neglects to mention that using a theme will create a huge folder of theme graphics in your web, whether your site uses those graphics or not. So you can double or triple your upload time.<br />This example is emblematic of many problems with the book. I'm not a sophisticated computer user, and when I'm first learning a software, I count on the &quot;dummies&quot; titles to answer my novice questions. When I have questions that go unanswered, something's wrong.<br />This might be a good book for the individual user who wants to fool around with the software and perhaps design a personal web page.

Set in 1923 England, this series follows the adventures of the Honorable Daisy Dalrymple, a young woman who has defied convention by choosing to make her own living (as a journalist) rather than let her aristocratic family support her. She uses her connections, however, to gain access to material for her writing.<br />In this, the second of the series (preceeded by &quot;Death at Wentwater Court&quot; and followed by &quot;Requiem for a Mezzo&quot;), Daisy is researching information for the second installment of her articles on country manor houses for Town and Country magazine. Having inveigled an invitation to Occles Hall, Daisy finds herself entangled in mystery when the body of a pregnant maid is discovered in the garden. Aggravated by the ineptitude of local investigators, Daisy calls on her friend Alec Fletcher of the Scotland Yard for help.<br />This series is absolutely charming, a delight for fans of the &quot;cozy&quot; subgenre of mystery writing. Unlike many authors of this subgenre, Dunn doesn't over-rely on antics and hilarity to carry her story, but instead allows the mystery to drive her plot. The characters are interesting and well-developed, the depiction of the era is precise, and the execution of the mystery plot is masterful.<br />Daisy is an enormously likeable character, intelligent and practical. There is a lot to like in this series, so hopefully this title will be re-released in paperback soon (as was the first in the series). In the meantime, check your library, and tell your friends.	2000-10-08

As an avid mystery fan, I'm amazed I haven't heard of this series before; I stumbled across this book by lucky accident but will be recommending it to everyone I know.<br />The setting is 1923 England, a tumultuous time--the nation is recovering from the Great War and changing social mores threaten the status quo. The Honourable Daisy Dalrymple (daughter of a Viscount) has decided to pursue a career as a writer and journalist rather than be financially supported by her family (shocking!). Her upper-class connections allow her access to Wentwater Court to write a story on this country manor house for Town &amp; Country magazine. But Daisy soon finds herself investigating the death of a fellow guest whose skating accident might not have been an accident at all...<br />This book is a breath of fresh air in a genre whose conventions too often lead to predictability. Daisy is a truly likeable heroine. She is modern, but modern for HER time, not modern for our time. Her involvement with the mystery at Wentwater Court is the product of her attraction to the Chief Inspector on the case and her desire to help the Wentwater family, rather than the result of the all-too-typical &quot;unbridled curiosity&quot; that aflicts most amateur sleuths.<br />The mystery itself is not a show-stopper, but neither are there any holes in the resolution. The real star of the series is the time and place. Although it's probably a bit overdone, it's wonderful fun to read about all these people calling each other &quot;old bean&quot; and &quot;chum&quot; and exclaiming, &quot;How perfectly ghastly for the old prune!&quot;<br />I'm looking forward to the next in the series.	2000-10-01

I hesitate to call this novel a masterpiece, not because I have any  doubts, but because I fear it may turn people away from a really enjoyable  book. Don't let the critical acclaim scare you off--this is a great  read.<br />Tom Ripley is a down and out young American whose prospects are  minimal until he is sent to Italy to persuade an old school chum, Dickie  Greenleaf, to return home to the United States. Instead of convincing  Dickie to return home, however, Ripley finds himself enamored of Dickie's  carefree lifestyle and ready access to money. Ripley dreams of becoming a  permanent fixture in Dickie's life, but when it becomes clear that Dickie  is growing bored with Ripley, Ripley calmly and coolly kills Dickie and  assumes his identity.<br />Mr. Ripley's talents, alluded to in the title,  include forgery, impersonation, and murder. What makes this book a  masterpiece is the way Highsmith draws the reader into Ripley's world. His  actions seem not only logical, but also inevitable. The reader is brought  to sympathize with him utterly, as we watch him grow (if it can be called  that) from a clever but passive misanthrope to a cunningly amoral hedonist.  How can you loathe a man who wants to use his ill-gotten gains to start an  art collection?<br />The story is told from Ripley's point of view, which  leaves the reader with a lot to think about. Ripley's perceptions are  necessarily tainted by his own world view, and the book may well be worth a  second or third read to try to sort out Ripley's perceptions from reality.  Does Dickie love his lady friend Marge, or are they just good friends? What  are Dickie's true feelings for Ripley? What brings Ripley to act the way he  does?<br />The answers provided in the recent movie based on this novel are  rather simple and, ultimately, pedantic (focusing too much on the  possibility that Ripley is homosexual). The novel is far more interesting  and complex. Don't miss it!	2000-09-05

Of course change happens. Of course  we should embrace it. Of course many people don't.<br />There are people who  need to read this book, however. We all know people who refuse to accept  any change, no matter how small, even if the change is a good one.  Resisting any and all change is a waste of time and energy because change  is coming; this is just how the business world is (not to mention life  itself). You can sit around and complain about it or you can get up and  move on.<br />At every job I've had, I've worked with someone who's so angry  about the changes going on (if you work somewhere where there's no change  occuring, be afraid) that they make everyone around them miserable. But  despite their unhappiness, they won't quit because that would be even MORE  change. So they just stay unhappy.

On the one hand, this sixth book in the Stephanie Plum series has all the qualities of the previous five. Unfortunately, it also has all the same  plot devices, with nothing new to enliven the mix. The novelty has worn  off, and Stephanie is starting to look pretty shallow. What other grown  woman is so devastated by a zit or so obsessive about sex? It's funny, but  it's also getting pretty old.<br />The cliffhanger from the previous book is  resolved with little fanfare and even less finesse, pretty much setting the  tone for the entire book. The usual hijinks ensue with the usual crowd:  Grandma Mazur, Lula, bumbling thugs (following her around, just like the  last book!). None of this would be too bad if Stephanie herself would grow  a little, but she's the same ol' Steph, sailing along without too much  introspection.<br />I'm not even sure this book can be called a mystery, since  very little sleuthing occurs, and the mystery is not so much solved as it  is resolved.

Donna Andrews' debut mystery is a lot of fun, a great bathtub book. Meg Langslow finds herself maid of honor to three demanding brides, and Meg  takes the summer off from work to oversee the wedding plans in her small  Virigina hometown. When murder taints the wedding plans, Meg adds an extra  item to her too-long &quot;to do&quot; list--find the murderer.<br />Meg's  family (indeed, the whole town) is a wonderful mix of obliviously eccentric  folks: an uncle who wears a gorilla suit to formal parties, a cousin who  thinks wearing clothes is a sin, a group of die-hard croquet players  determined to &quot;play through.&quot; In the hands of a less able writer,  this group of oddballs could seem contrived, but Andrews has a light touch,  and the group remains amusing and even realistic. The author's decision to  keep Meg the straight man is a wise one.<br />The weddings provide a useful  backdrop and ample opportunity to drop dozens of &quot;red herrings.&quot;  Unfortunately, a little too much time is spent on the weddings, and not  enough on the mystery. Many side stories, although resolved in the end,  have nothing to do with the main mystery. This is a bit of a cheat in the  mystery world.<br />And finally, Meg's friend Michael, and the  &quot;thing&quot; he tries to tell her all summer, is extremely obvious and  very distracting. Another reviewer has described this as farcical, but I  found it very cumbersome. Nonetheless, I look forward to Andrews' next  entry in what promises to be a delightful series.	2000-08-12

Gillian Roberts is a wonderful mystery writer. In each of her books, there is always at least one point when I laugh out loud at her witty phrasing, and when she's at her very best, as she is in &quot;Helen Hath No  Fury,&quot; I laugh from beginning to end (look for Roberts' vivid  description of the effects of humidity).<br />Amanda Pepper is a high school  teacher in Philadelphia. Although she has a live-in boyfriend (homicide cop  C.K. Mackenzie), she is of an age when her friends have been married  multiple times, and her own single status is a source of frustration (at  least to her mother). When a member of Amanda's book group is found dead of  an apparent suicide, the group's suspicions are aroused, and Amanda, in her  continuing quest to retrieve her raincoat from the dead woman's house,  finds herself in the middle of a murder investigation.<br />Roberts has cooked  up a solid mystery here. At one point, I felt positive I knew the culprit  and was surprised and pleased to discover I was completely wrong. For the  avid mystery fan, there is nothing better than the surprise ending. Add to  that the fun of reading about Amanda, a character whose evolution  throughout this series has been interesting and enjoyable without ever  overpowering the mystery plot, and you have a real winner.	2000-07-29

Jo Fuller is plus-sized and not ashamed of it, and when her close friend is found murdered with &quot;Kill the Whales!&quot; scrawled on the mirror, Jo decides to  investigate. As any fiction reader can attest, overweight female  protagonists are few and far between, and the introduction of such a  character should be a refreshing breath of fresh air.<br />The problem with  this book is not that it's heroine weighs over 200 pounds. The problem is  that reading it FEELS like reading a book with an agenda, rather than  reading a book with a great mystery plot and an interesting heroine. The  author is simply too heavy-handed with the message--slim people are  depicted as starving, unhappy, and unfailingly rude.<br />On top of that, Jo's  instant (mutual) attraction to her dead friend's lover was repellent to me.  You know the old saying about the body not being cold yet? The connection I  felt to Jo, with all her wit and charisma, was severed when she gave in to  this attraction.

They are presumably very expensive outfits, though, and serve as visual notice of the type of advice  contained in the book.<br />The advice on &quot;building a wardrobe&quot; is  almost non-existent (one list of 10 &quot;must-have&quot; items is the sum  total). Most of this book is devoted to descriptions of the clothing and  retail industries, with long passages describing different types of fabric.  Gershman is clearly a fan of haute couture, and much space is spent  describing $500 &quot;bargains&quot; (picked up at shops around the world).  She does not spend any time discussing color choice, and her idea of  accessories is Hermes scarves, Chanel earrings, and fake flowers. She  recommends flying yourself to New York twice a year to do your  shopping.<br />If money, practicality, and closet space are not issues for  you, you might find this book useful. The rest of us, however, have much  better books to choose from. I recommend Linda Dano's &quot;Looking  Great,&quot; a book so essential to building a good wardrobe that I find  myself coming back to it again and again.	2000-07-22

First off, this is not a book on building a wardrobe wisely. This is simply a book to give you ideas and guidelines for outfits to wear on specific occasions.<br />Unfortunately, the guidelines provided are wrong.  When the author advised that it was OK to wear black or white to a wedding,  I was willing to concede that standards have changed in this area, and that  I am very traditional in thinking that black or white is offensive at a  wedding. However, when the author stated that formal dress for women  includes dresses above the knees (i.e., cocktail dresses), I quit reading  the book. How can I trust advice from someone who doesn't know that formal  dress for women means wearing a full-length gown? Her definition of  &quot;white tie&quot; is way off the mark. And taking her advice on casual  workday dress could end your career prematurely.<br />This is a helpful  &quot;idea&quot; book for adding pizazz to your outfits, but if you need  advice on dressing well for a certain occasion, look elsewhere.	2000-07-22

Books	1	87	127	N	N	Poor dad must be spinning in his grave.	This book has some valuable and interesting tips for the financially savvy. Unfortunately, the book presents itself as a guidebook for beginners, and in inexperienced hands, this advice may spell financial  disaster for those who need the most help.<br />Example: Kiyosaki encourages  risky investments over more stable but less profitable investments. This  might be good advice for those with an already diverse portfolio, but  considering that the vast majority of people are not adequately preparing  for their retirement years, this advice might be the worst possible.<br />The  rich dad/poor dad story that everyone else seems to find so charming  repelled me--Kiyosaki seems in need of therapy to resolve his childhood  issues. He encourages the reader to not let money have too much power, but  then he has clearly made it the governing influence of his entire  life.<br />Sadly, the biggest weakness of this book is that Kiyosaki never  conveys WHY the acquisition of money is so important to him, or should be  to us. He doesn't know what it means to feel pride in one's work, or to  love one's job. He also doesn't seem to know what it means to enjoy life as  opposed to enjoying money.	2000-07-17

This series features Lily Bard, an emotionally and physically scarred cleaning lady with a penchant for solving mysteries. (She lives in a town called Shakespeare-- Shakespeare/ Bard...get it?) As a rape survivor, Lily  is a loner with little patience for the everyday human interactions that  most people thrive on, and cleaning is part of her refuge (as well as her  livelihood).<br />Sound dark? It is. Up to this point in the series, Lily's  past has been part of her characterization, part of what makes her  interesting and different. In this, the third entry in the Shakespeare  series, Lily's past dominates the story as she comes home for her sister's  wedding. The neighbors and loved ones she left behind look at her and think  &quot;rape victim,&quot; not &quot;Lily,&quot; and she cannot stand their  pity.<br />Add to this drama a visit from Lily's intense boyfriend (with whom  the sex is so steamy the two can barely keep their hands off each other),  and the mystery plot is simply incidental. One of three little girls was  kidnapped as an infant from her true parents, and solving the mystery is  more a process of elimination than an exercise in sleuthing.<br />This is not  a stand-alone mystery; readers should start with the first two in the  series, then read this one to understand the development of the character.  Though it was nice to meet Lily's family and explore some of her past, I  look forward to seeing Lily return to Shakespeare for the next book.	2000-07-15

I heartily agree with the reviewer who described this book as an &quot;outline&quot; for a great mystery. Mystery fans will find this book extremely formulaic and simplistic. The familiar and uninteresting  characters were most disappointing to me: the little old lady who's not  what she seems, the wise-cracking reporter, the bumbling but  well-intentioned police chief, the intelligent young woman trying to put  her past behind her, idiot teenagers. The fact that the little old woman is  an alcoholic is not amusing or charming, though the author thinks it  is.<br />The plot is contrived to introduce the whole crossword puzzle theme  to the series and to introduce all the characters to us. It holds up well  enough, but can't compensate for the weak characters (including the  killer).<br />Readers looking for an interesting old lady would do well to try  Heron Carvic's Miss Seeton series instead.	2000-07-04

I find myself writing the same things over and over about the books in this series, but Grafton is so consistently top-notch that it's hard to think of new superlatives. Kinsey is a great character--complex, tough,  practical, nosy--and Grafton stays true to that character in all her  books.<br />Kinsey's not just solving a mystery in this one, she's also trying  to outwit the hit man on her tail. To this end, she teams up with another  P.I. to act as her bodyguard. This innovative twist adds just the right  amount of suspense to this book, and the ending--to both the mystery and  the hit man scenario--is definitely a kicker.<br />Whether this is your first  Kinsey Millhone book or you're a fan of the entire series (there's a nice  emotional payoff for Kinsey fans in this one, as Kinsey finally meets a man  worthy of her), this one is a must-read. Enjoy!	2000-07-04
US	52240801	R3QOYZVSCTLQQG	0679453040	787273382	Blood Money, A Jane Whitefield Novel	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Absolutely preposterous and thoroughly enjoyable.	Ok, ok...so the premise that five or six mob families all use the same guy as their accountant and that this man keeps all their account information in his head is a bit of a stretch. (That this man's death is so easily  faked is even more of a stretch, in my opinion.) Once you get past the  set-up, this book is very enjoyable.<br />So if you were a mob accountant who  had faked his own death, you'd have two problems: what to do with the  billions of dollars, and where to hide. If you're lucky, you'd have the  help of Jane Whitefield. Jane is a woman who specializes in making people  disappear. She's also smart as a whip and pretty mean with any weapon she  can lay hands on. Watching her think herself two steps ahead of her  pursuers is one of the joys of this series.<br />Perry is a good writer, and  the Jane Whitefield series continues to be excellent. The ending to this  novel is not as climactic as in some of his other novels, but if it had  been, it would have seemed formulaic. Hats off to Perry for keeping us  guessing.	2000-06-06

Sue Grafton's books are so GOOD that she makes mystery writing look easy. But it's not, she's just excellent at what she does.<br />&quot;F&quot; takes Kinsey Millhone out of town to solve a 17-year-old murder case, and she's  soon up to her ears in decades-old clues and crimes. One of the things  Grafton does best is to create vivid and realistic communities of people.  &quot;F&quot; is a great example of this--each character we meet is  interesting, complex, AND has interactive relationships with other  characters we've met. Everyone's connected, and when Kinsey solves the  mystery, it makes sense because it FITS the characters.<br />My only (minor)  complaints are that I missed the usual cast of characters (especially that  Hungarian-type woman at the bar where Kinsey eats) and that Grafton  indulges in a little moralizing at the end, which seemed heavy-handed.	2000-06-03

I love all these recent reviews calling &quot;A&quot; trite and typical--Grafton wrote this in 1982, and if it seems trite now it's because Grafton revolutionized the genre, and everyone has been copying her plots  and style ever since!<br />Kinsey Millhone is a hard-boiled, gun-toting,  loner--a private investigator who keeps to herself and does whatever it  takes to solve her case. I first read this book as a teenager, and Kinsey's  toughness and un-sentimentality turned me off (young romantic that I was).  Coming back to this series as an adult has given me an appreciation for the  character and the genre that I lacked before. What you see is what you get  with Kinsey Millhone, and that simplicity is her strength.<br />This book is  not only truly groundbreaking, it is also a plain ol' great mystery.  Grafton keeps Kinsey busy interviewing suspects, following leads, and  stirring up trouble. Kinsey's work is pretty much her life, and except for  the occasional evening with a handsome stranger, you can expect her to stay  focused on the case.<br />Unless you prefer your mysteries soft and cozy,  you'll enjoy Kinsey Millhone and her straight-forward approach to crime.  Best of all, if you enjoy this one, there are 14 more (so far) to keep you  busy.	2000-05-30

There are are hundreds (maybe thousands?) of historical mystery novels out there featuring women who are out of step with their time period (i.e., heroines who appeal to our modern feminist sensibilities). Hannah Trevor is  one of the only protagonists I've ever read who is actually ostracized for  this incongruity. Subsequently, she is also one of the most believable  historical characters I've ever met. <br />This is a dark tale of  post-revolutionary United States. Bad things happen to good people in this  series, and although it's sometimes hard to read, it's also utterly  realistic. Life is very, very hard for the inhabitants of this world, and  for Hannah especially.<br />The plot is solid and interesting but necessarily  takes a backseat to the time and setting. The main characters are  relentlessly intense--I wish Hannah had been able to throw her head back  and laugh once or twice, but this is not that kind of story.<br />This is a  hard book to put down, and you will come away from it feeling as though you  have traveled to another world. But you might want to take a break with  some light-hearted reading before embarking on the sequel.	2000-05-30

Anne Perry started a revolution with this book, the first in her Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series (Charlotte is not &quot;Pitt&quot; yet in this book). When murder  disturbs the elite and proper world of the Ellison family, the cracks begin  to show in the family's heretofore placid exterior. Family members start to  look at each other with fear and doubt, and suspicion is as frightening as  truth.<br />Perry's depiction of Victorian England is detailed and  fascinating--she is as knowledgeable of upper-class life as she is of the  working-class. Her characters are realistic and sympathetic, and the kicker  of an ending in this book is the sort that has become her trademark.<br />You  cannot call yourself a fan of the historical mystery without reading this  book.	2000-05-30

The mistake Perry made in her Pitt series was developing her characters too quickly--she has had to compensate by introducing a rather large cast of supporting characters. This, the first in her William Monk series,  avoids that gaffe by inducing amnesia in her hero--he hardly knows who he  is or what he's about. It may be preposterous, but it's also an enjoyable  read and an outstanding mystery.<br />The story has Monk attempting to learn  the set of circumstances that resulted in his hospitalization and  amnesia--he must face the horrifying possibility that he was involved in a  vicious crime, and he knows too little of himself to trust that he was  incapable of such a deed. He learns through the reactions of others that he  was (is?) not a nice man, and the more he learns, the more he doubts  himself. The fact that his past does not come flooding back to him after  another bump on the head speaks well to Perry's prowess as a  writer.<br />Hester Latterly and Oliver Rathbone are the edgy counterparts to  Monk's dark personality. Though never friends, these three circle each  other with wary respect. Monk himself is an appealing character, the  mystery is top-notch, and the Victorian setting is quintessential  Perry--she has made it uniquely her own.	2000-05-30

This is an absolutely compelling novel that depicts a group of people, each a specialist in his or her own field, struggling to track down a serial killer back in the days when &quot;serial killer&quot; was an  unknown phrase. The process they use to catch this  killer--&quot;profiling&quot; as it known nowadays--is untested and  unreliable at their point in history. What is fascinating about this book  is not watching these people track down a killer, but watching them  discover HOW to track down a killer. The point of this book is the journey,  not the destination.<br />And what a journey! Carr is a vivid writer, bringing  each character to life so clearly that I could see the story unfold in my  mind as clearly as if watching it on a movie screen. You've read the phrase  &quot;couldn't put this book down?&quot; I called in sick to work to finish  this book.	2000-05-30

This is an outstanding mystery series for lovers of historical fiction, and although this entry may lack the punch of the first two (there seemed to be too few real surprises) the book is still a worthwhile read. The  mystery is solid and interesting, the characters are complex, and the  description of time and place is unbeatable.<br />Best of all, Fiona Buckley  is an extremely good writer, a true pleasure to read.

There's a reason the Harry Potter books are so popular with an adult audience--they're wonderful! And Jim Dale brings Harry's world to life in the audio versions--I pity readers who have ignored these outstanding  tapes. Thankfully, they're unabridged. You won't want to miss a word.<br />The  third installment in the series is far and away the best (so far), full of  surprises and twists. The first two books follow a pretty simple formula  and felt like children's books--I was beginning to fear the entire series  would follow the same predictable format. But Rowling's readers are growing  older along with her protagonist, and the plot of this one is subsequently  more sophisticated.<br />Like the rest of the world, I am eager for the fourth  book, but willing to wait the extra time for the audio version. Mystery  readers should try this series--although the books are known as  &quot;fantasy&quot; novels they are also cracker-jack mysteries, complete  with clues, surprise revelations, and adventure.<br />Those of you who are too  embarassed to be caught reading a &quot;children's&quot; novel have  probably also missed out the best fiction of C.S.Lewis and Madeline  L'Engle.

The other half is one of those never-ending police standoffs shown on television, with a million cop cars surrounding a building from which shots are ocassionally fired. I don't  find myself watching that sort of thing on TV, and it is even less  compelling in writing.<br />Decker's co-workers are more the focus here than  his wife, Rina, despite her name on the cover of the book. Still, this is  Decker true to form, and fans of this series will enjoy visiting with this  favorite character.	2000-05-29

This book is a western, not a mystery. It tries to be a mystery, but it relies too heavily on events that happened earlier in the series. In other words, if you haven't read the rest of the series, you have no chance to  solve this one and probably won't care enough to try.<br />Fremont's captivity  is disturbing and dull, and I am not interested enough in the supporting  characters to enjoy an entire book with them at center stage. Everyone  seems to act out of character in this book, and it doesn't help that none  of them are quite in step with the time period either. How could it have  taken so long for women to get the vote with so many bold adventuresses on  the loose?<br />I loved the first two books in this series, but was  disappointed in the last one and EXTREMELY disappointed in this one.

Fans of this series have certain expectations, and Evanovich is smart enough to deliver. Our heroine is smart-mouthed and sexy (not one, but TWO incredibly handsome beefcakes are after her in this one), the supporting  characters are...ahem...&quot;colorful&quot; might be the right word  (colorful to the point of parody--not always intentional), and the plot is  fast-paced and fun. Stephanie tends to stumble over clues and stumble out  of dangerous situations, and the joy of this series is that none of the  stumbling feels too contrived.<br />Kudos to Evanovich for sticking to a  winning formula--she knows, as do her readers, that the charm of the  Stephanie Plum series is Stephanie herself, not the plot. The fact that the  plot is quite good is just icing on the cake for mystery fans.	2000-05-29

Readers who know Jane Austen through only her novels (and not her letters, for example) may not always  recognize Barron's sophisticated integration of fact with fiction, but  anyone familiar with Austen's biography will surely enjoy the imagination  and cleverness of this series. Mystery lovers and all but the most  curmudgeonly of Austen fans will enjoy this well-written tale as  well.<br />The first in the series, this book introduces Jane-as-sleuth along  with the cast of supporting characters. Barron is true to Austen's  character and life (as much as we know of it, anyway) and has written a  solid mystery also. Thoroughly enjoyable.	2000-05-29

Dobson's specialty  (in my opinion) is the integration of subplots and side stories with the  main mystery. Everything happens for a reason, and the reason always has to  do with the mystery (not just to throw the reader off-track).<br />I'm looking  forward to the fourth book in the series this winter.	2000-05-29

This book is for anyone who has a closet full of clothes and nothing to wear. Ms. Dano guides the reader through the process of creating a classic wardrobe that will stand the test of time and fads. I used to dread  shopping because so many of my purchases ended up languishing, unworn, in  the back of my closet. No more! Now I know what I'm looking for.<br />My only  complaint is that more time and space was spent on wardrobes for work and  not leisure wear. And I could have lived without the chapters on makeup and  weight loss; I'd love an entire book from Linda Dano focusing solely on  clothing.	1999-05-02
US	52240801	R2QB4A4AIOBP7Z	0345432983	590484933	Bedford Square	Books	3	3	4	N	N	What a disappointing plot.	I am a HUGE Anne Perry fan, but I found this one to be a bit of a letdown. Perhaps I've been spoiled by Perry's trademarks: tightly wound plots and shocking conclusions. This one just seemed to sputter to an end.<br />Plot  hole #1 (don't worry, I don't give anything away): Part of the big mystery  is figuring out what all the blackmail victims have in common. During the  course of Pitt's investigation, several  of the victims discover who their  fellow blackmailees are and rack their brains trying to figure out what  they all have in common. But when the reader finally learns what the  victims DO have in common, it seems inconceivable that the victims  themselves didn't figured it out earlier.<br />Plot hole #2: It's clear very  early on that the blackmailer is blackmailing to cover something up (i.e.,  not blackmailing for money). But when you discover who the blackmailer is,  you never understand WHY he or she (or they) did the thing that's being  covered up. The motive seems to be: the villain is a bad person. Pretty  weak by Perry's own standards.<br />The historical detail and the main  characters are engrossing as usual, which is why I've given three stars.  But the mystery lacked punch.	1999-04-11

I really enjoy the Fremont Jones series, particularly the characters and the historical setting. But the plotline of this book was simply too thin. Dianne Day has fallen into the lazy mystery writer's trap - the solution to  the case is &quot;The murderer was a lunatic!&quot; The reader plods  through myriad clues and tangents only to have everything suddenly wrapped  up in one swift, unconvincing chapter.<br />I also fear that the Fremont Jones  character is losing some authenticity. She is an atypically progressive  woman for the time period, yet everyone who meets her seems to love her.  Everything she does/attempts works out just perfectly (i.e., her guise as a  man - so successful that her own lover doesn't recognize her), and her  every problem solves itself easily (i.e., her money situation). I much  preferred the Fremont of the first two books - a woman who was struggling  to make ends meet, to find her way in the big city. She seems to have lost  some humanity.<br />I hope that the next installment in this series shows  Dianne Day returning to form and giving us the Fremont Jones we want to  read about.	1998-11-30

I've read my share of mysteries with fantastical plots, but this book had not even one sympathetic character. I didn't care about anyone, I didn't care about the story, and I didn't care  about the outcome. In fact, I didn't even read this book in its entirety  (and I normally manage to plod through anything once I've started), but my  mother (who had loaned me the book) assured me that finishing the book was  a waste of time. I LOVE Kellerman's other books, but I won't be tricked  into buying another book with these characters again. Kellerman fans -  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!	1998-11-30

I have read dozens of decorating books only to conclude that I don't have the money or time it takes to create a living environment that FEELS RIGHT. Lauri Ward has set me (and my furniture) straight. Step by  step, she shows you how to fix what's wrong in your home - even the  intangible &quot;this room just doesn't feel right.&quot;<br />This book is  particularly useful for renters. The average decorating book focuses almost  solely on color, something most renters have no control over. This book  focuses on the placement of your furniture, art, and accessories - the  things you can control AND are easy to change. This is the first decorating  book I've ever read that really made a difference in how my home looks and  feels. Thank you Lauri Ward!	1998-11-14

A Breach of Promise exemplifies everything wonderful about Anne Perry's  work: complex characters, a detailed plot driven by those characters, and a  rich, historical setting. Whenever I finish one of her books, I feel I have  learned something new about the human psyche and its darker side. Hester,  Monk, and Rathbone, with all their tension and awkward friendship, are  fascinating, and watching them grow as people over the course of this  series has kept this reader immensely satisfied. Add to that satisfaction  the interest and complexity of each &quot;case&quot; the three have worked  on together, and you will understand why Anne Perry has so many devoted  fans.	1998-10-03
