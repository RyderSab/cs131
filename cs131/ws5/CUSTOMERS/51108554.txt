The greatest economy in the world? Lowry says it didn't happen. Turning the biggest deficit in US history into the biggest surplus ever? Lowry says it didn't happen. A president respected all over the world? Lowry says it didn't happen. Drop in crime rate? Lowry says it didn't happen. Drop in poverty? Lowry says it didn't happen. Winning a war in the Balkans without US casualties and a quagmire? Lowry says it didn't happen.<br />And what happened with the so called Clinton scandals? Not a single high level administration official was convicted of a crime. Compare that to the Reagan/Bush I years when a record number of administration officials went to jail. <br />Lowry seems like someone living in an alternate universe where people watch FOX &quot;news&quot; all day, listen to Rush Limbaugh and read propaganda in the National Review.<br />I can't wait for his next book. What will he call it, &quot;Bush Respected World Leader&quot; or how about &quot;Record Job Creation Under Bush&quot;? Why not. When you are dealing with ideology instead of facts and arguments you can make ridiculous claims.	2003-10-25

On the one hand I wanted to give it a high rating for all the laughs. On the other hand it is so poorly written and poorly reasoned that it deserves a 1 star rating.<br />Have you ever been to a movie that was so bad that you actually enjoyed it? If you like movies like that you should buy and read this book.<br />Bush has the worst economic record of any president since Herbert Hoover. Pick a category and check his record. It is a miserable failure. Somehow in the Bowyer and Kudlow universe this is characterized as a &quot;Bush Boom&quot;. It is surreal.	2003-10-24

I doubt future historians will find anything of interest in it. It reads like a novel with stereotypical characters. <br />Woodward brags about all the access he got from top goverment officials and he paints heroic portraits of people who gave him access, including Bush. But it doesn't look like he asked any meaningful questions to people who gave him access. Why war with Iraq? Why now? Woodward doesn't say. It looks like there was an understanding. Woodward would get access and in exchange for access he wouldn't ask any inconvenient questions. <br />Bob Woodward the journalist has been utterly corrupted by power. He is now just another Washington insider.	2003-06-22

She brags about being a member of the Sally Queen Special Class in Washington. She shows contempt for ordinary people and their concerns. She hated Al Gore because he talked about issues on the campaign plane, issues that effect the lives of millions. She liked Bush because he served lobster ravioli on the campaign plane and made funny faces instead of boring her with discussion of issues. She recycles her columns from Time magazine. No original insights in her columns. Just conventional wisdom. No wonder Time magazine cancelled her column.	2003-06-21

Mrs Clinton writes about her childhood, upbringing and life experiences that shaped her views. She also goes over all the pseudo scandals of the Clinton years, beginning with Whitewater, Travelgate, Filegate etc. and reminds us that the most massive witchunt since Salem conducted by a right wing zealot prosecutor produced no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the Clintons. People who have been getting their news from the Corporate Media, owned and operated by republicans may not know that. <br />She goes over the whole Monicagate farce and it is obvious that Mr Starr colluded with the Jones lawyers to set up an entrapment for her husband in an effort to drive him from office. Thankfully this attempted coup d'etat failed. What should have been a private matter for the Clintons was made public for political gain by their enemies. <br />And finally I would like to recommend Clinton Wars by Sidney Blumenthal for anyone buying Living History. Mr Blumenthal goes into more detail exposing various right wing conspirators, people who bankroll them and their handmaidens in the Corporate Media.	2003-06-17

Bob Woodward's book reads like a novel. He has constructed a narrative with various characters cast in stereotypical roles. This book could have been written by Karl Rove. You are not going to learn anything about Bush or his regime reading this book. You will learn a great deal about Woodward and how he operates as a \\"journalist\\". He brags about all the access and documents he received from various goverment agencies. He brags about the interviews he got with everybody including Bush. You can't help but wonder why he never asked any meaningful questions. After awhile though you get it. What Woodward is giving us is Access Journalism. In exchange for access to high level officials and all the meaningless trivia they gave him Woodward shamelessly carries water for his sources. There is nothing in this book to tell us why we are going to war with Iraq. Woodward never bothered to probe. He was too grateful for the chit chat he had with Bush and others to ask any inconvenient questions or do any investigating.	2003-01-29

He starts with conclusions and then tries to fit the facts to support his conclusions. <br />Wittes conclusion #1) Starr was a non partisan prosecutor. Wittes disregards a mountain of evidence showing blatant partisanship on the part of Starr and his prosecutors. He omits any/all evidence of partisanship in order to advance his favored narrative. <br />Wittes conclusion #2) Starr cared about the truth. Again Benjamin Wittes ignores evidence that contradicts his thesis. Starr lied under oath to the House Judiciary Committee about the leaks. Starr's office lied to the Justice Department when they said they had no prior contacts with the Jones lawyers even though they had met with them and other 3rd party figures to set up an entrapment. Starr lied to the American people when he issued a statement saying Monica Lewinsky had gone on a \\"sojourn\\" at the Ritz Carlton. The list of lies is endless and Wittes chooses to ignore them. <br />Wittes conclusion #3) Starr misinterpreted the Independent Counsel statute. Benjamin Wittes wants us to believe that Starr would have used the same tactics against a conservative republican president. <br />Someday, someone will write a good, honest book about the Starr investigation. This is not that book. ...	2002-05-31

Beth Harpaz invites the readers to observe the goings on of the campaign. Unlike many TV pundits she does not take herself seriously but she clearly takes her job seriously. I was especially impressed by how she questions herself and her own news judgment. It is truly refreshing in an age of arrogant know it all journalism. I also liked the fact that Beth Harpaz does not seem to have a political agenda like so many other books about Mrs Clinton. She simply shares with the readers her witty and engaging observations. Mrs Clinton comes across as reserved but it is easy to understand why. Her every utterance, every gesture is fodder for headlines, sometimes exaggerated, misleading headlines. She had to develop a reserved persona as a protective shield.	2001-12-27

After reading this book you will know for sure what you always suspected. Chris Matthews doesn't think. He has strung together a whole bunch of homilies, many of them contradictory. He projects his own biases to the population at large. He hates Gore, so everybody hates Gore, which is why he lost. Trouble is Gore won. He won with a bigger margin than Kennedy over Nixon and Nixon over Humprey. <br />This book is strictly for Hate Radio listeners who think Rush Limbaugh is an intellectual.<br />What was I thinking buying this book?	2001-12-12

She exposes the likes of Cokie Roberts and Bob Woodward for what they are. Washington Insiders. Not journalists. They are players in the game of politics, actively shaping events instead of just reporting them. They use coded insider language to obscure events and to exclude the public from the national dialogue. Instead of a Goverment of The People we have a goverment of Washington Insiders, consisting of talking heads, lobbyists, contributors. They frame the issues, spin the news and advance their favorite narrative. They are the Permanent Goverment, unelected, unaccountable. No wonder half the people don't bother to vote.	2001-11-09

We have a tendency to view Supreme Court justices as King Solomon administering impartial justice. This is a fantasy. Judges are political animals just like politicians, with their own partisan agendas. In a fair world Scalia and Thomas would have recused themselves for conflict of interest. But installing their man in the White House was more important to them than all other considerations, including upholding the US Constitution. <br />The Senate should carefully examine all judicial nominees and reject those with ideological taint.	2001-11-07

It is not a &quot;tell all&quot; book. He doesn't expose all the deals cut between various news organizations and the Office of Independent Council. But what he reveals is disturbing enough. <br />I suspect when future historians look back at Monicagate they will be writing quite a different story from what has been written so far. The real story has to be written by people who don't have an investment in it. Unfortunately the entire Washington Media Elite is so invested in this story that I don't trust any of them to write an objective account of it. They can't tell all without revealing their own complicity in it which is why Michael Isikoff's book was so disappointing. He had gone out of his way to erase his own fingerprints. <br />Kalb's book is disappointing in one regard. He doesn't examine the implications of what happens when the press trades access for silence. The press kept quiet about Starr's collusion with Jones lawyers for fear he would cut off leaks. Unfortunately this kind of quid pro quo happens every day across the country. Reporter keep quiet about prosecutorial abuse in exchange for illegal leaks from prosecutors, Police, the FBI. Any discussion of this is treated as taboo by the press. <br />Kalb also doesn't discuss the Grand Jury laws broken by Starr's office in the name of &quot;the rule of law&quot;. But in fairness that is an altogether different book.<br />Overall Kalb's book is helpful in understanding the hysteria that gripped the press in 1998.	2001-10-23

All unsubstantiated or substantiated through questionable sources.

Is there a support group for these airheads?<br />This book is just  more Hillary hate. Ingraham claims she doesn't really hate Hillary. She  could have fooled me! <br />What is clear is that hatred came first, rationale  for the hatred later. Ingraham starts with a venomous hatred of Mrs Clinton  and then starts to find reasons to justify her hatred. She tries to read  Mrs Clinton's mind and ascribe motives to her. It is a form of projection.  Everything she hates about herself she projects on to Mrs Clinton.<br />You  won't learn anything about Mrs Clinton from this book.

He is now a &quot;Washington Insider&quot;, and  like all other Washington Insiders his raison d'etre is to protect and  perpetuate his own power. <br />Woodward is overly generous to his sources and  unfair to people who did not leak to him. He repeats the same point over  and over &quot;if only they were more open and honest&quot;. He never  questions his own assumptions and sees nothing wrong with the current Salem  era witchunts. There is no soul searching on his part as so how he  contributed to the current atmosphere with Woodward wannabes peeping  through bedroom keyholes. <br />There are no fresh insights in this book, just  a few scoops about trivial matters to sell books.

But the book will be required reading for future historians who will  be studying the events and the players. It connects all the dots the  mainstream media deliberately ignored. <br />Surprise, suprise. Starr was not  an &quot;independent&quot; counsel. He was an honorary member of various  right wing think tanks and Clinton hate groups. Various &quot;objective  journalists&quot; were nothing more than stenographers for Kenneth Starr,  taking notes from the illegal leaks for their future book deals(hello  Michael Isikoff and Susan Schmidt!). Starr had been colluding with the  Jones team all along, most likely using Michael Isikoff and various evles  as go between. <br />The book is required reading for anyone who wants to know  how the country came close to a coup d'etat.	2000-02-27
