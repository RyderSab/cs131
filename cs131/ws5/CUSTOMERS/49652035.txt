The book seems to be about...what is this book supposed to be about?  The back of the book reads like it's a juicy &quot;sister friend&quot; book but the words between leaves much to be desired.  I do agree with others who recommend reading Chocolate Star so that one can become familiar with the characters but I cannot say that I would recommend this book at all.  There is more name dropping than plot, no kind of character developement and the writing just seems a bit dry.  There are times that I found myself rushing through the page in an attempt to get to a better part.<br />If you are truly in need of boring yourself or just want to see what's next for Topaz and the gang then get a copy from the library.	2002-05-04

I was first introduced to Patty Rice via Somethin Extra and lets just say that book wasn't my bag.  However, &quot;Reinventing the Woman&quot; left me with a wholenew respect for Patty Rice and a chance that I will go back to the first book.<br />This is the story of deceit, betrayal and love.  Not a love story of the usual kind but a story of a woman learning to love herself.  Camille Foster a woman abused by her boyfriend for seven years.  Camille makes a deal with herself to leave the next time the man who says he loves her hits her and flees to the home that she has long since abandoned.  On the road to recovery Camille takes a job with Nora Roberts, a motivational speaker and author of a workshop 'Reinventing the Woman'.  From here Ms Rice weaves a story of a woman longing to be loved, learning to love herself and what it means to reinvent Camille.<br />There are some loose ends with Camille and the relationship with her abusive boyfriend as well as her relationship with the mother who ignored and shunned her.  I believe (and I hope correctly) that this means that there will be a sequal.<br />The developement of the main characters was pretty good.  I appreciate the fact that Camille wasn't written as someone who automatically was able to turn off her feelings for the man that hurt her.  The supporting characters could have used a bit more developement, especially some of the players in Nora's company and Camille's mother Catherine.<br />All in all this is a very good read, engrossing and kept me rushingthrough the pages so that I could see what was going to happen next.<br />~R	2001-12-20

Chief Hanks stumbles along the body of a cult member while chaperoning ten of Maggody's future on a retreat.  The rest of the book is the usual fare with adventures of the townfolk of Maggody and Arly solving the crime.<br />As always Joan Hess keeps the antics of Kevin Buchanon, Mrs. Jim Bob and Brother Verber (to name a few) laugh out loud but Arly is not the typical heroine who is always kicking butt and able to solve crime.<br />I did find this book a bit lacking with the Maggody parts.  There didn't seem to be the same development as if they were rushed.  Otherwise an entertaining read.	2001-09-30

Norma and Moxi are friends although they are from opposite sides of the track.  Their friendship is put to the when Norma reveals a secret to Moxi.  There is also Moxi's relationship with her teenaged daughter Zadi and how Moxi must learn to let her little girl grow up into the young woman she has become.<br />This was an excellent book.<br />The characters and situations were real:  Norma's relationship with her son and the feelings that she must confront as she struggles to balance motherhood and her career.  Zadi and the hair drama.  This is a must read for every mother, sister and friend.	2001-09-30

With Just Say No I found myself not at all as interested in the book as I should have been.<br />A brief synopsis: Darin Harmon, an outgoing kid befriends shy John Williams.  Although the two are opposite (Darin is into sports and John is into music) they remain friends throughout grade school and high school.  Once in college John comes out of his shell after singing at a talent show and becomes John &quot;Loverboy&quot; Williams.  The book moves along through Darin and John's sometimes rocky, sometimes sweet road to fame and the girls, drugs and drama that goes with success, fame and money.<br />The story seemed to move along at times and I found myself savoring every moment.  There were parts that I couldn't wait to get through and had to force myself to read (the lyrics so some of the songs for example) and that's when I found myself wanting to put the book down in frustration.<br />The inside look at the life of a celebrity was really interesting and I found myself glad that I wasn't on that road but this book did lead me to ask if I could &quot;Just Say No&quot; to the temptations that were avaiable to John and Darin.	2001-09-23

Ms. Biggs invites the reader along to hear Tamlyn's thoughts as she grows from naive child to strong woman.<br />What I love best is that Tamlyn could be anyone of us: she came from a good family yet made some bad decisons. The reader is invited along to grow with Tamlyn and experience both joy and pain as she matures.<br />The style of writing is excellent and tight, unlike other AA works, without the benefit of a tacked on ending.	2001-09-14

This was one of the worse books that I have ever read.  I want to applaud Nina Foxx for writing and having her book published but I swear this book was terrible.<br />The main character, Amber, was a psychologist but she was so dippy and I felt that she had such a damsel in distress attitude.  Why was she so dependent on a man?  Her husband did her wrong and the man she got with was married so you know he couldn't have been about nothing.  Her best friend was a trip.  Why WAS she still friends with Che?<br />There were so many unanswered questions like what happened when Tyler came back into town?  Why was someone so smart doing so many dumb things?  What was the deal with all of the women hitting on her?  If she was so close to her family why didn't she talk more about the stuff going on in her life?  What was the deal with the color thing?  For an educated woman Amber was really, really ignorant.<br />I love AA fiction but this book seemed to be poorly thought out, rushed towards the end and just all over the place.  Don't waste your time.	2001-09-10

In a time where HIV and AIDS dominates our lives it is good to send a message that there are still other diseases that can be caught and that one still must be careful.  However this book seemed to jump all over the pace as if she wanted to get so much infomation in and wasn't sure how to organize it.  I give the author her &quot;props&quot; for writing a book and getting published but parts of the plot dragged on and on and at times she jumped from idea to idea.  I kept re-reading pages thinking that perhaps I skipped a few lines.<br />I did like the way she kept Jasmine &quot;real&quot;.  I felt like Jasmine when I was layed off and when Jasmine got into it with Jennifer at work.  However the plot was a bit predictable and the story was a bit boring.<br />I would recommend borrowing this book from a library or a friend.	2001-08-13

Mason's debut novel is for all the sistahs out there who think that abuse doesn't happen to us.  This is the book for all of the women who feel that they can't say &quot;Man please!&quot;.I was hooked from the first lines as Ruth describes the abuse and humiliation that she endured FOURTEEN years from a man who was unable to be a man.  I was drawn in to the way Ruth talked to me as she described the years of abuse, how she was broken down to feel as if she was less than nothing.  I felt every hit, my heart beat faster every time Eric was on the scene and I almost wept as Ruth realized that she needed to be free.<br />J.D. Mason doesn't gloss over the issue of abuse and she doesn't make this book &quot;easy&quot;.  She addresses the abuse and the healing that Ruth goes through .  The supporting characters were also developed in a way that I could actually identify with some of them and see where they were coming from.<br />Great book however I was a little disappointed with the the Ruth/Adrian outcome.  (I won't spoil it for those who have not read it.)  Maybe because of what Ruth endured I felt that she needed a different resolution but otherwise this is an excellent, excellent worth the money read.<br />This is a buy your own copy and don't lend it to anyone untrustworthy kind of book.	2001-08-04

The idea that Black women are so identified by the hair on their heads and how they look is an excellent topic. While I didn't expect this book to be a soapbox and a rallying cry against the makers of relaxers I did expect to read a book that had some character developement, a decent outcome and entertaining. Don't waste your money. Get ye to a library. When I learned of a book called Nappily Ever After I thought, &quot;Thank God! A book for those of us who have true kinks, not the curly 'do that blows in the wind that is the norm of Black characters on TV and in magazines.&quot; I was expecting something new and fresh since the book promised to be a Cinderella story for the rest of us.<br />I am still disappointed by this damn book.
