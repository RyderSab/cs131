US	53025572	R25SLE6IPSB91P	0873416783	41382903	The Potter's Professional Handbook	Books	5	14	14	N	N	For the serious hobbiest and the professional potter	This is the book I have been looking for.  I'm building a clay studio and wanted advice and tips on how to set it up.  This is the only book I've found that gives really in-depth information on these topics.  He also covers other topics you would want to know if you're going to be a professional potter.<br />Not only does he share some of his own horror stories (so you won't repeat them yourself!), but he also includes insets of the stories of other pro potters and their studios.  Very helpful.  He covers studio needs, selection, etc.; working with suppliers, vendors, contractors; equipment selection;  and business practices, marketing and self-promotion (the hardest part of the business for me - and I think for most artists!).  He also talks a bit about teaching and it's effect on your work (pro and con).  The subtitle of the book says it all:  &quot;The complete guide to defining, identifying, and establishing yourself in the craft community&quot;.<br />This book is a must have for any professional potter and will be found very helpful even to hobbiests.	2002-01-06

The photography is the thing!  I've never seen such beautiful photography of pottery in my life.  All you potters out there, this is what your slides should look like!  (Good luck.)  A very lovely book of a great cross-section of American Art Pottery.  Obviously, very inpirational and highly recommended.	2002-01-06

There is an accompanying CD-ROM that contains all the designs which can be used with both Mac and Windows.  You will need to have Photoshop or other software to import the image to for manipulation.  You can use up to 10 images free of charge in other projects without having to get special permission (kinda like the Dover Pictorial Archive books).<br />The book was printed in Singapore and is of very high quality.  The images are beautiful.  In some cases they take a simple geometric design and distort or curve it to obtain other designs from it.  In some cases, they show a geometric block design on one side of the page and a group of four blocks on the facing page, so you can see what happens with repeats and secondary designs created.  There are designs in circles, squares, hexes, elipses...<br />I would recommend this book to quilters (like myself) and anyone else who loves two-color design.	2002-01-06

Nope.  This is a Rodale quilt project book, albeit of Amish-style quilts.  The projects are nice and are for various levels of experience.<br />There is a square within a square project that is nice for beginners.  There are other projects for beginners: an 81-patch, a split bar, broken dishes, Sunshine and Shadow, a Roman Stripe, and a double irish chain quilt. For the intermediate quilter, there's a Robbing Peter to pay Paul, Chinese Coins variation, a double nine patch (which I would call easy, but since it's on point, maybe it really should be considered intermediate) and a foundation-pieced Log Cabin.  For advanced quilters, there's a double-sized pinwheel design they call Sparkle Plenty that is really pretty. The color choices made by the people who designed the projects are appropriate and yet colorful - updated Amish, I would say.<br />There are basic quilt making directions and some information on the Amish in the back of the book, and some basic quilting designs which can be copied to a size to fit your quilt.<br />It's a nice book for what it is.  Probably of most value to beginners.	2001-06-17

Anyone who has made a quilt will find they already know this information, but beginners might really appreciate it.  (There are other books for this information, though.)  Chapter 2 is where she gets into borders and it really is a &quot;border primer&quot;.  She covers every possibility from no border to stretching the design into the border, single &amp; multiple bands, squares, triangles, and appliqued borders.  In Chapter 3, she covers scalloped edging, prairie points, piping, and dogtooth edges.<br />Chapter 4 is the Gallery and Patterns section.  As there are only 3 or 4 *pieced* border designs and since this is the lion's share of the book, I was a little disappointed.  All the rest (of 17 total patterns) are for applique.  Beautiful and varied, but applique is not my thing...yet.<br />If you're looking for some really nice applique border designs, this is definitely the book for you.  Just xerox and go!	2000-12-30

The author has done his homework and presents the description, pros/cons and pitfalls of each type of construction.  He is very honest about just how &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; each type can be, and how much it will cost you.  He also covers passive and active solar design, natural water capture and other alternative technologies to go with your natural home.  This is an excellent overview on all these subjects.<br />The best thing about this book is that he refers you to other sources for more detail - books, videos, newsletters and organizations that will support you, give you a workshop or just give you more detailed information than belonged in this primer book.<br />I highly recommend this as the first book you read on the subject.  Once you know which type of house you are interested in, you can pick up some of the other books he suggests on that building type.	2000-10-18

It was quite eye-opening to read this book on large scale projects.  It is written in a very clear manner, with wonderful pictures.<br />I only fault him  on his tile making techniques, which could be better, but hey, who cares?  His expertise lies elsewhere. He has obviously worked out the best  techniques for large ceramic projects.<br />I like the way the book is  organized.  The chapters are very sequentially logical (to me).<br /> Chapter  1: Tools and Equipment<br /> Chapter 2: Building and Decorating  Techniques<br /> Chapter 3: Sectioning, Drying, Glazing and Firing<br />  Chapter 4: Installation<br /> Chapter 5: The Projects<br /> Chapter 6:  Gallery<br />The Projects chapter reiterates some of the information in  previous chapters, but this time applied to a particular project.  This is  fine with me, since reiteration is a good teaching technique. The Gallery  chapter is quite inspirational!  There are lots of pictures of  installations done not only by Peter, but also other artists.<br />Makes me  want to try some architectural ceramics!	2000-06-14

One might just write it off as a nice coffe-table book, but I feel it's much more.<br />In addition to simply gorgeous photography, including detail and up-close shots of the incredible inlays,  there is very nice text that tells the whole story of the buildings.<br />Translations of the quotes from the Qu'ran that cover the buildings and  the tombs are also included and they are very poetically rendered.<br />This  book is exactly what I was looking for.  It shows the Taj at it's very best  and in full color.  I continually enjoy looking at the book, and am  inspired by the designs.  I highly recommend the book to anyone who loves  design and inlay.	2000-04-09

This is a small book, but I think anyone who makes pots would value it for life.  The author, Toni, outlines the entire, traditional process of making Pueblo pottery.  And I mean, she starts with  collecting the clay and adding grog and goes all the way through the  wood-buring, smoke firing process that produces those wonderful black,  burnished pots!<br />She takes you through the process to create just ONE  black pot, which turns out to be a prize-winner!  There are lots of  pictures throughout that show the pot during various stages and the text  gives pretty detailed information on the process.  She does leave out some  things, maybe assuming the reader already knows them, but you could  probably create your own Pueblo pot using this book.<br />I found the  description of burnishing using slip to be most valuable, as well as the  firing process, which I'd never seen before.<br />I highly recommend this to  potters, especially handbuilders who use the coil method to build pots.	2000-02-20

After an introductory chapter dealing with the geometric basis of design,  the author goes on to discuss implements and their uses, borders, textile  patterns, nature study and treatement.&quot;<br />&quot;Over 300 illustrations  include many diagrams, designs for title pages, border patterns, allover  patterns, textile patterns and historical examples from an extraordinary  number of cultures and periods...Thorough and comprehensive, [this book]  will be an invaluable resource for anyone seeking to learn the principles  and techniques of creating nonrespresentative designs.&quot;<br />To which I  will add, the illustrations are nice as they include a little block showing  you how it was drawn, and sometimes giving variations (positive vs  negative, simple vs complex, etc).  A large part of the book is spent  showing textile patterns.  I think maybe that was the original bent of the  author.  But there are also lots of lovely border designs, too.<br />Well  worth the price!	2000-01-17

There are floral borders, tree of life and other botanicals, as well as elephants, cows, horses, and some people playing  traditonal Indian instruments.<br />According to the back cover, the authors  travelled extensively in India to collect the designs, copying stencils  used by village artisans and Hindu priests.  The designs have traditionally  been used to decorate the floors of temples, etc, so this is probably why  they are so large in scale (usually one design per 8x10 page).<br />I still  found it a worthwhile collection from which to pull Indian designs.	2000-01-17

The designs are heavy on animals, griffins, fleur-de-lis, and heraldic motifs, but all are nice.  Some designs are very simple and bold, and others have lots of  detail.  My favorites are the repeat designs.	2000-01-12

Lots of animals, dragons, griffins, and fleur-de-lis.  There are also face images of kings, jesters, etc.<br />All  designs are shown in decent (maybe actual?) tile size (around 4-5 inches  square), as well as in groups of four (or more if required), to show how  repeats would work.  All designs are very bold and simple, but amazing when  placed in repeat.<br />Nice designs for beginning tile makers to use, since  the designs can be easily worked in clay.  Well worth the cost of the book.	1999-12-20
US	53025572	R240WDYUW932HX	0679600841	748295604	War and Peace (Modern Library)	Books	5	18	22	N	Y	Wonderful, if the translation is good	There are a couple of things to watch out for here.<br />1. Make sure you are reading a really good translation of an unabridged version of the novel.  This can make the difference between loving a sweeping epic, and  feeling like you're trudging through a long soap-opera.<br />2. (I may  alienate some teachers with this) BUY THE CLIFF NOTES for this one!  This  is the only book where some form of notes are needed to keep track of  characters' names and relationships - and Russian history, if you're not  familiar with the time period.<br />Having said all that, I really enjoyed  this book.  I read some portions in Russian and read the Norton Critical  edition translation in English ( a wonderful translation that appears to be  out of print? ).<br />I still think the imagery is amazing.  I'm convinced  I've been on a fox hunt, attended the Bolshoi in the 1800's, and have  ridden in a troika - though I haven't.  This is the power of Tolstoy's  writing.<br />The book can be read on several levels, all entertaining and  thought-provoking.  If you are young, read it like you would a good Jane  Austin novel, concentrating on the people and the relationships.  If you  know some Russian History, read it for the comments it makes about the  out-of-touch-with-reality, French-speaking aristocracy and the reality of  war with France, as well as the characters. (The characters are Russian  architypes, and therefore of interest to me, as a student of Russian  History.)<br />If you're into philosophy, politics, religion, whatever,  you'll find something here to stimulate you.  Tolstoy was pretty extreme on  some of these topics, and it starts to show in this novel.  (Reading about  Tolstoy can be helpful to understanding the book as well.)<br />The book  probably deserves multiple readings, even though I know how overwhelming  that sounds. (I'm a slow reader, myself!).<br />Definitely deserves to be  called a classic.  I highly recommend it, even if you don't make it through  the whole book.  Read as much of it as you can.the whole book.  Read as much of it as you can.	1999-11-19

One sheet contains a very large sun with a face in it, another smaller sun and a moon with face (profile).  Another sheet contains all stars in  various styles (one looks like the Texaco star!)  The last sheet contains  more stars, another plain crescent moon, and some planets (mostly  Saturn-looking).  On this sheet you have the option of combining or  spliting the designs.<br />Would probably be perfect to stencil a future  astronaut's bedroom.	1999-11-10

There are several individual design motifs, from Neffertiti, a scarab and other bugs, to the eye of Ra.  There  is also one Egyptian border design which is quite nice.<br />I would have  preferred a few more designs that were smaller.  But, the designs are  fairly large, so even kids could use them with success.  Great fun.	1999-11-10

The first sheet contains large mammals, etc. like whale, dolphin and shark.  The other sheets contain other sea creatures, such as shells, lobsters and  crabs, turtle, and a sea horse.<br />All designs are large and open, and would  therefore be easy for kids to use.  I wish the plastic was of a little  heavier gauge though.  The light blue plastic seems a little fragile to be  used by kids.	1999-11-10

It was sobering to notice, when reading about all the tile  companies, how many went under during the depression or just afterwards.  This country lost a wonderful heritage, as many never came back after the  depression lifted.  Too bad, really.  There are currently some companies  making copies or remakes of some designs (what with the renewed interest in  all things Arts and Crafts).  Maybe this book and the Neo Arts and Crafts  movement will spark some new American tile making shops?  I hope so.<br />The  book is beautifully laid out and would be a nice coffee table addition for  those who are not tile collectors, but who just enjoy looking at tiles.	1999-11-10

Can be used for any stenciling project.  I have used them to carve into clay tiles, with great success.<br />Might be a little challenging for kids as the designs are (by necessity)  rather detailed, and therefore not as open as some other motifs. Still,  they could be fun to experiment with.  For children of all ages.	1999-11-10

I say &quot;about&quot; because in some cases the designs can be combined or split up as you wish, especially on one of the sheets.  One sheet contains only two large fairies.  Another contains the three that  could be combined or split up.  The last contains four more smaller  fairies.  Many of the fairies are interacting with other items that could  be used separately; like hearts, flowers, leaves and branches, and a  butterfly.<br />All designs are fairly open and would therefore be easy for  kids to use with success.	1999-11-10

The story of the Ukrainian occupation during WWII, as well as Babi Yar death camp are fascinating, if also horrifying.  The book covers a theatre  of the war that is seldom covered in such detail.<br />The honesty is the most  interesting part.  The author, a 12-year-old boy at the time, (and NOT  Jewish), had no reason to fabricate, and with an innocence that makes it  clear he isn't trying to propogandize, just reports the horrors he sees.  The book also includes some later gathered (when the author was grown up)  interviews with survivors of Babi Yar death camp which are even more  harrowing.<br />The most fascinating part of the copy that I have is that it  BOLDs the portions of the book that were edited out by the Russian censors,  before the book was published in the Soviet Union.  It is interesting to  notice what the censors chose to cut out, as much as what they chose to  leave in!<br />Well worth finding in a used book store, if you can.	1999-11-10

Well, you would have if the other news stories about East Timor over that past few years had made it into the mainstream news!<br />This book made me realize just how bad the  situation is out there in the media.  How controlled by corporate PR and  government intervention our supposedly &quot;free&quot; media is.  How  could this happen in the United States of America?<br />I highly recommend  this book to citizens who want to be better informed.<br />The news stories  suppressed by Ronald Reagan (and his &quot;administration&quot;) alone tell  a horrifying story of how a politician tried to ram his agenda down our  throats, without our knowing about it, so that we couldn't dissent or have  opinions. And how he tried to censor everything he could, so the American  public couldn't get any information about anything the government was  doing.(Read Ch. 7, 1982, #6 &quot;Ronald Reagan: America's Chief  Censor&quot;.) There are also a multitude of stories censored by  trans-global corporations what will scare you to death when you read them.  What corporations will perpetrate on the public's health, just to continue  making a buck, will shock you.<br />The orignial news stories are covered in  summary form, the sources are cited, and there is usually an Update on what  has happened since.  Sometimes the update is more harrowing than the  original!<br />It is your civic duty to read this book.	1999-11-10

(The other is Handcrafted Ceramic Tiles by Janis Fanning)<br />The book is an excellent introduction to the techniques used, but you must remember, Frank  has been doing this for a long time.  There are some techniques he shows  that should not be tried at home (or without teacher supervision).<br />The  best part of the book for me was the color photo samples of tile  installations.  The book is an excellent resource for everything from  tessellations to tile painting.  Inspirational. Highly recommended.	1999-11-10

All are large, and one sheet is all griffin motifs.  There are a couple of designs that include celtic knots, but I wanted more, or more intricate knotting  maybe.<br />The designs included are nice though.	1999-11-10

Learn to blend blocks from the same patch family to form new,  exciting designs.  Includes more than 150 traditional, historical and  original block designs.  No math! No graph paper! No fuss!  Includes  gallery of quilts.&quot;<br />I'm sure this book is excellent.  Joen Wolfrom  is a pro; check out her book &quot;The Visual Dance&quot;.	1999-07-08

I'm a ceramic tile maker and have been trying to figure out Escher's designs, with only limited success.  I have also had some unexpected mishaps with other types of tessellating tiles.  So, I am really happy to have this book.  It has helped me through the &quot;gotchas&quot; of making  tessellating designs, and has given me many other design ideas.<br />This book  is beautiful, well laid out, with excellent illustrations and pleny of  ideas.  The math employed is usually the minimal amount needed to get the  job done, although sometimes she does try to really explain the geometry.  (That's where she loses me, but that's OK.  I've had LOTS of success  without understanding at that level). She explains concepts like  translation, mid-point and corner rotation, glides, and mirroring in a way  that anyone (even the math challenged, like me!) can understand and work  with them.  She also covers tessellations made from angles other than 90  degrees (for example, from shapes like triangles, hexagons, kite shapes,  etc.) for the adventurous spirited.<br />She includes exercises in case you  want to use the book as a textbook for yourself or a class. It doesn't  matter whether you are making quilts, tiles or something else.  The  concepts and directions apply no matter what the medium.<br />Highly  recommended for anyone who loves tessellations!	1999-06-27

I was, however, disappointed that all the illustrations/pictures were in black and white.  Bummer.  The best part  of Islamic tiles, as far as I'm concerned, is the use of color!  I was  hoping for lots of color pictures of Islamic mosques, etc.  Nope.  Anyway,  I guess it's good as an art history book.	1999-04-24

Many are very flowery and detailed.  Many would make either good fabric or better wallpaper designs.  I bought the book for  ceramic tile designs and had to weed through for something that would work.  Most of the designs were too much for my purposes.  Still a very good  source of inspiration, as all Dover books are!	1999-04-24

Thank you, Joen, for choosing to teach us  this stuff!  Too often, the design and color aspects are  &quot;assumed&quot; by the author of quilting books.<br />Absolutely the best  book on quilting design there is.  If you are looking for &quot;how  to&quot; make the quilts, this is not the book.  There are other books for  that.	1999-04-24

There is a four-page description of repeat pattern types and figures to show you what they look like.  The best part of the book doesn't come until page 33,  where the author really gets into how to create your own repeat pattern.  Between these two sections of the book are eight pages of flower and  butterfly motifs you can cut out and practice with.  The one chapter is  good but I wanted more!  and some discussion of creating designs in  multi-colors.<br />Don't pay any more than the $3.95 Amazon price for this  one.	1999-04-24

This is part of the Dover pictorial archive collection, so the whole book is designs.  The bit I like about this book is that the designs are in color, so you can see variations in light and dark colors, color  combinations, colors receeding and coming forward, etc.<br />Some designs are  done using just the tile shape, and some depend on designs painted onto the  tiles.  Some are very bold and simple designs and some are very flowery.  Appears to be a good mix of designs from around the world and throughout  time.<br />Well worth the price!	1999-04-24

I was introduced to Francis and Margaret MacDonald during the Charles Rennie MacKintosh exhibit at Chicago's Art  Institute.<br />Since the Art Institute will not do an exhibit on these  gals, I only have this book.  Just wonderful.  I wish there were even more  illustrations.  I love this stuff - more than the work of the Glasgow Guys.	1999-04-24

She has included both traditional and  more recent patterns, and freely admits that there are probably many she  hasn't managed to include.<br />The patterns are named using the most typical  or most popular traditional name, but alternate names and, in some cases,  alternate versions of designs are included as well.  This is a good pattern  reference for beginners as well as advanced quilters.  Advanced quilters  may find a block they forgot about!<br />The only drawback is that the designs  are all in black/white and grey tones.  This allows advanced quilters to  pick their own colors (using the grey scale as a clue to color value), but  for beginners it would have been helpful to include some designs in color.	1999-04-24

The descriptions of the techniques are in some cases not as detailed as one might want, but if you know what you're doing, they  are good enough. The photos in the book are particularly inspiring and  beautiful.  There are some lovely examples shown of every technique  discussed. I highly recommend this to anyone new to pottery as a source of  inspiration and information.	1999-01-01

Required reading for Women of all ages	This is the most influential book I've read on getting control of my  money.  It is not a book about budgets, investing, etc.  It should be read  long before any of that!  It should be required reading for women in high  school.<br />The book talks about the beliefs, attitudes and fears women have  about money.  Some have been inherited from the culture in general, some  from our families.  All are important to identify for yourself (hopefully  at an early age!) so that you can modify them before they get you into  financial trouble.  I found myself in several of the chapters, even some  that outlined phobias I wasn't aware I had.  The awareness alone has been  worth the price of the book.  (It takes a lot more to actually change all  the beliefs, etc.)<br />I highly recommend this book to women, and I think men  might also find it insightful as well.	1998-10-15
