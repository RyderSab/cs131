This story started out with a bang and frankly there were no dull moments throughout.  Taylor, a radio psychologist starts getting stalked by an unknown man.  She has her suspicions on who it could be but nothing is for sure.  She meets Reed, an attorney, when she is asked to sign some papers.  Anyhow, they hit it off and start dating.  There are conflicts because he is attorney to one of the men that could quite possibly be her stalker.  As I was nearing the ending of this book, my heart was actually racing.... An incredilby difficult book to put down.  I give it 5 stars...easily.	2005-09-09

I don't understand why Seth treated Raine with little respect and she always forgave.  She was described as a beauty who was loyal and kind.  He after losing his brother Jesse was angry, distrustful.. etc.   Even after spying on her with his cameras in her home, he still thinks she's up to something.  I realize he had no reason not to believe she was a whore at first but she proved to him time and again that she was loyal. Another thing is where does he get off giving her orders as if she was a dog?  I would have told this bitter man to take a hike.  If you like books with plenty of graphic sex and don't care about the relationship between the main characters, this is for you but if you like books that also include mutual respect.... pass.  Yes, I expect to have many disagree with me.	2003-09-07

As other reviews below state, it is about Riley and Brin, a couple separated that talk about past events throughout the story to get to the root of why Brin left Riley.  I would much rather have read the book because the woman that read the story was too sugary for me even in scenes where Brin was mad.  'OHhhhhhhhhh Riley!  Give me a break.  I won't listen to any more tapes narrarated by that lady Alison. She ruined the story for me.	2003-08-29

I listened to it on tape and played it everywhere I went on my walkman.  Wolf kidnaps the beautiful Cymbra for the sake of peace among the Saxon and Norse clans.  He had originally requested she accept him but when his letter was rejected he took her by force.  One writer said that they were too perfect and nothing to write home about.  I beg to differ.  Sometimes some stories are so incredibly full of strife that they get so exasperating.  This story reminds me of the many written by Julie Garwood... my favorite all time historical writer.  As for BELIEVE IN ME... I did enjoy the characters although I wasn't thrilled about Krysta's beliefs that she was not a normal human being.  I have a hard time reading about what in my mind is fantasy.  Thorgold and Raven's presence would have been fine if they weren't magical.  I'm not into magic... that's fake.  Nevertheless, Hawks sister Daria does things in the first book but all is discovered in the second.  I have just started reading Come Back to Me and have no doubt it will be another winner.. provided there aren't any wizards.	2003-08-25
US	51311268	RYLUJQ5HHD5HV	0553584510	943340840	The Survivors Club: A Thriller	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Based on Unabridged Audio	I listen to audio books when I go for walks and this book kept me walking long after I was tired every day because I didn't want to put it away until the next day....  At first I thought there were too many characters but I then I realized they all played an important role in this story.  Story is about three women who were victimized by a rapist and the club they create.  The convicted rapist is killed and detectives try to find out if one of or all three victims had a role in the death. What I loved about this book is that just when you think you have figured out what is going on, another twist is introduced.  I felt like I was on a very winding rollercoaster. A must read or even better, a great book to listen to on tape.	2003-07-29

I needed to know if mediation was for me.  Divorces can be very expensive (I have friends who have gone through them) and I didn't want attorneys to get the better deal.   Chapters include how mediation differs from litigation.  If it's the best choice for you.  Choosing a mediator and their role.  The process of mediation...children and finanacial issues.  In essence, it takes you from start to finish.  The scenarios with different couples were so varied that I am sure you will find a situation that is similar to yours.  A must read if you want to know how it all works.  I learned so much from this book that I would recommend it to anyone contemplating...	2003-06-18

Sara West is sent to a hospital that houses military men with a disorder she has successfully treated.  She has little choice as she wants to know what really happened to her brother-in-law David(a military man that was reported dead via suicide) and Foster assures her she will find the answers she is seeking there.  She meets 'Joe' a man who although has problems due to what he has been through, a great man she finds herself attracted to.  I have read from other reviews that what goes on here can happen.  Not in my wildest dreams had I imagined that our service people might go through something even close to what these people did for the sake of their country.  My admiration for those in the military has grown beyond measure.  This is a great story.  If you like to read books where you aren't sure who is good and who is bad until the very end, this is it.	2003-05-27

I started it Saturday morning and didn't put it down until I finished it, Saturday night (I'm a slow reader).  Jake Logan and Laura Taylor marry in order to make it easier for Jake to gain custody of his son Timmy.  Laura is more than willing to do this as she truly loves Timmy and is very close to Jake.  They promise each other that they will not fall in love and that the marriage is strictly to benefit the child.  (Good luck is what I thought at that point) As both involved in the military where danger is always around the corner, Laura is around Timmy more often than Jake.  Madeline, Timmy's mother and a drunk constantly tries to harm Laura as revenge for 'taking' Jake away from her; sometimes even risking the child's life and wrecking havoc in this family's life, which includes making it difficult for Laura to officially adopt Timmy. Neverthless, someone out there hates Laura and Jake enough to attempt to kill.  I love the chemistry between Jake and Laura, how can there not be?  She see's his undying love for his son and he see's her unwavering loyalty.  A great read.  If you like this book, try Tempting Fate by Meryl Sawyer, similar in some ways but not exactly.  If you already enjoyed Tempting Fate, I guarantee you this too will be a winner in your book.	2003-04-29
US	51311268	R15518ALPXNW7W	1567404944	573580919	Carolina Moon	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Very good audio book	In reference to the unabridged audio, which is the same as reading the book, I will say that I throroughly enjoyed this story.  Tory Bodeen returns to the town she grew up in to start her own business and to find out who killed her best friend Hope when they were children.  In comes Cade, Hope's brother who is quite fond of Tory, in spite of his mother's demand that he not see her; the woman blames Tory for the death of her daughter.  Tory, somewhat phychic can read minds and knows of the killers other victims.  Faith, Hope's twin sister is a woman who while having resented Tory for her sisterlike relationship with her own twin is in my opinion a character I grew to like.  Nevertheless, the ending of the book literally blindsided me.  Not saying it was a bad ending, just not what I expected.  If you haven't tried audio books (unabridged as you don't want to miss the details) they are great especially to those who like to walk with a walkman intact.	2003-04-29

It's a fast read because putting it down is very difficult.  Gabrielle, a prison guard breaks up a fight between several men against one man, Randall Tucker, a man wrongly accused of killing his wife, as the other guards stood and watched without doing anything. The guards turn on her but she stands her ground. Due to the ruckus she creates by questioning why they didn't stop the fight, Randall is transferred.  On the way to the new facility Randall escapes.  She follows him well into the hot unforgiving desert and then together they fight to survive the journey.  I'm not giving anything away here, this all happens early on and the synopsis on the back of the book states as much.  This book reminds me somewhat of the movie 'The Fugitive' with Harrison Ford, a man running from the law trying to find the real killer as the cops didn't bother to look any further than the husband.  The book did not have any boring parts and had an excellent ending which means everyone gets what they deserve.  I read several books every week and this is not one I will soon forget.  I will look to read more from this author.	2003-04-24

Nevada meets Eden at a bar where she walks up to him thinking he is the owner of the store she needs supplies from.  She is harassed and he defends.  She goes to a cabin in the mountains to track wild cats and he follows days later to ensure she is okay.  I won't say more as I don't want to give the story away.  What I do not like is that she wears her heart on her sleeve and he, not a believer in love, takes what she has to give.  He's got too many hangups constantly telling her he doesn't want to hurt her but does it every time and she is his doormat; always available to please him. I agree one hundred percent with review(er) from June 18, 2002.  I will get bashed for this but I don't care, how can any woman lower herself to mush for a man who has told her time and again his feelings about love?	2003-04-21

Abbie DiAngelo is visited by her step-brother soon after his release from prison because he saw her in the news as a top chef and restaurant owner.  He thinks she's his ticket to some serious money after he schemes with another inmate to blackmail her.  I give nothing away here (as it's also in the back cover of the book), her brother is killed before she delivers the money he wants.   Detective John Ryan, finds she's not telling the truth but is seriously smitten with her.  You would think that after the step-brother dies her problems are over, but they are just beginning as there is another man out there wanting the money she was going to give her brother because &quot;if he was going to give it to her brother, she has it and can give it to him.....&quot;  A great story.  Another Christiane Heggan favorite is Betrayals.  If you haven't read that one, you're missing out....	2003-03-10

These couples got together very quickly and there wasn't any thrill of the chase.  I am a huge fan of Linda Howard, have loved all of her books (well... except Sarah's Child because she was such a pushover) but now Strangers is on that no good list.

I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I reviewed this book when I first read it, maybe one year ago??  I don't know what happened to the review, I didn't give anything away...  I do remember that I absolutely loved it and it was in fact the best book I have ever read by author Suzanne Brockmann.  I read 2-3 books a week and I cannot say I remember specifics, (of no help I know) but I wanted readers to know it is very worth the read. Very fast paced and you will no doubt have trouble putting it down.	2002-11-12

Poppy Mallory was a woman who lead a very difficult and interesting life and upon death left her inheritance to her heir.  The problem was... who was the heir... an ad had been placed in the paper asking the heir to make him/herself known.  Mike Preston, an investigative journalist found the add and decided he would investigate who was the rightful heir, for the sake of a book he wanted to write.  Several people answered the ad, all believing they were the true heirs.  As a reader also stated, I found myself rooting for some and hoping others were not.  I liked the fact that present and past events were mixed in throughout the book.  The only problem I had was that it didn't end as I would have hoped; slightly disappointed, but as I have read the reviews of others, they all seem quite satisfied.. so you be the judge.	2002-07-05

This story does have a lot of similarities to Adam's Fall by Sandra Brown.  A man who cannot walk after a fall and who would rather not live if he can't walk meets a spunky physical therapist.  He's rude and obnoxious at first but she's well able to handle him.  This couple is good for each other because they both have problems and they both help each other overcome them.  Not a thick book so you can probably finish it in one day, I did.	2002-06-17

I would recommend reading that one first.  Kate Logan an attorney is asked to represent Todd Buchanan, a man being sought for the death of his wife Molly.  The problem with this is that Molly was the sister of Mitch, Kate's boyfriend.  It all started with two people agreeing to meet in person after they first meet in an internet chat room.	2002-04-30

I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Finn Donovan, a man who lives alone in the mountains finds Mallory O'Brien during a heavy snow storm.  He knows she's in trouble as her hands are bound.  He takes her to his cabin not only to nurse her back to health but to find out how he can protect her.  You can't help but like her as she almost immediately puts her safety in his hands.  He's a man who is bitter from past events (you can read about it) and she is a pampered heiress who enjoys the simple life.  They do bicker but it is funny and not irritating.  A must read.	2001-11-19

As she is unchaperoned, he assumes she is Julian's mistress.  Brie leads Dominic to believe she does have a protector, although admits readily it is not Julian.  He's a notorious rake and she a spitfire with auburn hair.  Both have hot tempers.  They each hold their own and that is what makes them fall hard for each other.  There are misunderstandings but not so bad that you want to throw the book across the room, even when he jumps to conclusions very quickly.  Never was I bored reading this one.  Hard to find and very expensive but a must read.	2001-09-10

He finds her beautiful and has to meet her.  Callie Smith only did that extra piece as a favor to Terry, leading man in the soap opera.  The hunt is on to find her.  When she is offered the job she refuses as she is a Wall Street broker, not an actress.  She finally agrees to appear on this soap that is quickly losing ratings to help her friend Terry with problems he is having.  I'm not giving anything away here as this is made known pretty early in the book and this is what the focus of this book is on.  Callie's mother and sister also play a part here but are both bitter women.  The back and forth banter between Callie and Jason is very amusing.  Twilight, is the next book I plan to read as it is the story about Dana Miller, the private investigator in this book.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.	2001-08-17

Hunter, one of the bank robbers takes her with him as she can identify the outlaws.  His need to protect her from the other outlaws is strong as is the attraction between the two.  I really liked Leanne as she was no pushover and spoke her mind while Hunter found it amusing.  While this book has 426 pages, pretty thick, it is not boring so it could be read quickly as it is difficult to put down.  I have yet to be disappointed by any books written by Hannah Howell...	2001-08-15

It was obvious to me there was going to be more of the same in the last half of the book and frankly I didn't want to waste my time.  It was then that I checked the reviews from other readers that confirmed my suspicions.  I didn't like it that Venus gave in so quickly.  I thought the book was going to be about a rake pursuing a woman who didn't want him when all the others did.  I was so wrong.  If you like sex scenes galore, this book is for you... if you like interesting plots and maybe some (the key word here is some) sex to spice it up, then look elsewhere.	2001-08-12

Matt, Katie's really recent former lover sends her a diary written by his wife to explain why he is no longer going to see her (Katie)  Suzanne, Matt's wife is writing the diary for Nicholas, their son so he can read it when he grows up.  It is very touching and you can't help but love Matt, Suzanne, Nicholas and Katie.  All of course are terrific people.  I will say no more as I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't read it.

This was an incredible story.  I have loved all of Julie Garwood's historicals and this one is at the top of my romantic suspense list.  Whatever Julie writes, I'm going to buy.  Nick is called by his priest friend Tommy to help him when a man confesses 'Bless me father for I will sin'  The sin he is to commit is to kill the very priest's sister Laurent.  Laurent a beautiful and kind woman and Nick is the man that is going to protect her.  He will spend every moment with her.  They are both attracted to each other but he tries to ignore it as she is his best friend's sister.  This story moves quickly and there are no boring parts.  The stalker's identity actually caught me by surprise.  The entire book was great... the ending was outstanding.

Zena, attempting to get away from a man that she is supposed to marry, meets Prince Alex (Sasha) as he is heading out.  He agrees to take her with him thinking she is a streetwalker and doesn't mind the auburn haired beauty's company.  He finds out soon enough she wasn't what he thought but decides to 'keep her' for a while.  He does not want to marry anyone at his age so he makes it quite clear to her of his intentions.  Tempers flare and the trouble begins.. This book was quite graphic and that is fine but I don't usually like books where one of the main characters is not faithful after they meet. Also, there is a rape scene that I agree with another reader, was made to sound like it was not rape at all.  I would have rather that not have happened at all.  I was hoping against hope help would arrive in time.  Other than that, the storyline was good and I enjoyed it when this 'Archer' Prince realizes how much he cares for Zena and goes after her.	2001-06-13

Stefan is not an ordinary Prince, he's a man who doesn't think too much of himself as he has a scarred face.  Tatiana, his princess, seems plain when he first meets her and he is pleased as he doesn't think a beautiful woman would want him.  Much to the Prince's dismay, Tatiana is in fact beautiful but hides her beauty as she doesn't want to be accosted by the men at the bar where she occasionally dances.  If you like stories where the male character has flawed looks but a great big heart, you will love this one too.  Beauty is only skin deep. I think it's what's inside your heart that really matters and it takes a special someone to look past the flaws and see the person.	2001-05-26

Adam bitter with the world, feeling he will never walk again does not want anything to do with Lilah.  She is determined to make him walk again and he is determined to get rid of her.  The bantering between these two is outstanding and incredibly funny. I think Lilah was exactly what Adam needed, someone to push him to 'try harder', not coddle him.

While attracted to each other, Miranda does not trust men and is more concerned with finding a way to get moving on the train, to get further away from the two men she is fleeing.  This is a story of a doctor who learns she is an heiress and doesn't feel she would ever consider life with a small town doctor and she is a woman who feels men would only want her for her money.  I enjoyed it thoroughly and think others will too.	2001-05-13

Karen goes to New Orleans to identify her estranged father.  The detective in charge, Marc is no nonsense man who cares about his cases.  The attraction is mutual from the beginning and it got only better.  It was refreshing to read about two people who realize early on how they feel about each other instead of the always 'he/she loves me, he/she doesn't' That thinking is getting quite old with some authors.  Linda Howard is by far my favorite and I have loved them all.... with the exception of Sarah's Child because the female lead character was too much of a wimp.  I wholeheartedly agree with the reader from California... good work Linda!	2001-04-25

After that there were times I felt like throwing the book across the room.  One misunderstanding after another and I felt for both Nick and Jane.  He being part Indian felt all women would be repelled.  Jane, Nick's ward loves him from the start and so does he but he doesn't think it's right after all he is supposed to find her a husband.  Again I have to go back to the misunderstandings that tear these two apart.  If you can handle that, then read on... the ending is worth the read.  You will not be disappointed.	2001-04-25

I enjoyed all of the brothers but this one was somehow the best.  Gabe meets Elizabeth (Lizzy as he likes to call her) a seemingly square who wants to interview him because he was a hero.  He is too handsome for words and she feels she is too plain for someone so wonderful.  She is innocent and eager to learn... and he is intrigued and willing to teach.  A great read!	2001-04-25

Billy 'Crash' is arrested for the murder of his admiral and other agents.  He's innocent and hunts down those that framed him.  Backing up... Nell, personal assistant to Daisy, the Admiral's significant other appears at Crash's door to tell him that he is needed by the Admiral...Daisy is dying.  I'm not giving anything away here.  This is how it starts and it gets better.  Nell, knowing beyond a shadow of a doubt that Crash could never have killed his Admiral sets out to help him prove his innocence.  I loved it!

Janine meets Derek when she sets out to seduce her fiance the day of his bachelor party.  She slips into his room but instead encounters his best man, Derek.  Derek and Janine are forced to stay together in the same room for several days as the hotel has been quarantined.  If you're thinking that she shouldn't get involved with her intendeds best man and maybe best friend, don't... this man is only attending because his brother Jack, the grooms real best man has disappeared and he feels it only right to step in.  The book is a fun fast read with no boring parts and a great ending.  I cannot wait to read Jack's own story, 'It Takes a Rebel'	2001-03-01

We find out early on that Dan is in fact Ren, returing to exact revenge for an accident that could have cost his and his brother's life.  Ren also has obligations and commitments that he can't ignore.  Therefore, this story is about two people who love each other (and realize it fairly early and not at the end) but are committed to others.  I really enjoyed this story very much.  I haven't read all of Ms. Martin's books but so far this is my favorite.	2001-02-18

Ranulf has many scars, outward and surely inward and does not trust noblewomen.  Although he was supposed to marry Ariane as she was pledged to him early on, he refuses to wed her as he feels he can justly break the betrothal agreement as she's the daughter of the traitor.  He 'strips' her title of lady and calls her wench and/or leman.  (That part I didn't like) Nevertheless, they try to deny the passion they feel for each other.  His continuous mistrust of her is exasperating but it does fit well with the storyline.  I truly enjoyed it and it does have one of the best endings I have ever read in a book.  If you enjoy reading about much passion with very descriptive details, look no further.	2001-02-11

Carly arrives in the small town of Cameron, Ohio to investigate the murder of her brother Edmund.   She tells the town people, including Devlin, the sheriff, that she is a reporter (that part is true) but that she's doing a story on the town.  He worries that it will become a tourist attraction after her story is published and is against it.  Because he's a man that has been hurt by a woman before and she's a woman that suspects his father as the killer, they try on numerous occasions to squash their mutual attraction.  I enjoyed this book immensely because the story was centered on them and not so much on other characters.  Accidents happen to her as she gets closer to finding the real killer of her brother and Devlin is always the first on the scene to help her. I will read it's sequel 'Fugitive Bride' the story of Shea next; I'm so glad she gets her very own story.	2001-02-07

Jake a half Apache/half white drifter who has killed for survival meets the classy Sarah, a woman who travels to the small down to stay with her father.  Early on we find that Sarah's father is killed in a 'mining accident' and she does not find out until the day she arrives.  Jake, escorts her to her father's home (obviously her father couldn't meet her), out in the boonies hoping she will decide to go back where she came from as it is not safe for a beautiful and single young woman to be out there all alone.  Unable to convince this lady to return, as she feels that is where she belongs, he grudgingly decides to keep an eye on her for safety purposes.  The attraction is certainly there and what I like about this book is that they don't have the 'does he/she love me does he/she not' attitude that continues throughout some books, which is sometimes exasperating.  While I enjoyed every chapter of the book, the ending was outstanding.  This book is hard to find and when you do it can be quite pricey.  I won it on an auction and paid through the nose but I have to say I didn't regret it.  A lot of incidents that keep you turning that page.	2001-01-26

He offers to purchase the theater from her and she becomes angry that he would be so arrogant to even make the suggestion.  The mayor of the town becomes angry with Karen due to her 'callous' way of handling Max and losing a bank deal due to Max's attitude after the encounter with Karen that he decides to ruin her.  I'm not giving anything away here as it goes from here.  While they lead separate lives, Max never forgets the enchanting Karen and she too doesn't forget him but only remembers him with bitterness.  Events occur to these two while Ms. Heggan slowly works the plot for their future re-encounter.  It is a great story that you will not soon forget.  If you liked Betrayals, you will love Cannes.  If you haven't read Betrayals, you're missing out on another great read.  If you find Cannes buy it, as this book is out of print and hard to find.	2001-01-09

She, excited about marrying the man she has loved all of her life has to deal with a man who doesn't want to marry her even though her father told her that he has been waiting for her all those years.  She is a sweetheart and unfortunately learns her father's lies but that's what makes this story good...  I love it how Abbey slowly melts that heart of his.

He returns years later only after her summons to help her find her sister who has been captured by Indians..(I am not giving anything away here as it is part of the synopsis in back of the book).  His demand for payment for his aid is marriage to the beautiful Summer.  I enjoyed the book immensely but did not like how he continuously considered himself 'unworthy'.  Nevertheless, you can't help but fall in love with this man who only wants to be accepted.  This is the third Nicole Jordan book and my most favorite.

It is not written in Judith McNaught's typical style... couple meets, couple falls in love, misunderstandings occur where both think the other has wronged them, and then all works out... this was better!   If you enjoyed 'Paradise' and its sequel 'Perfect', I guarantee you will love this one.  'Remember When' briefly mentions Matt Farrell from 'Paradise' and it is about a once nobody turned tycoon but it is not boring because there isn't so much strife between the main couple.  I think it's better because of it.  There is enough strife in real life.  Cole meets Diana when he's a college student working as a stable hand and she a pampered but not stuck up daughter of a wealthy man.  They have a great friendship from the beginning... and it only gets better.  I love reading when a couple stands up to anybody for the other.  If you don't like that then don't read it.  This will remain in my keeper shelf.	2000-12-26

I think it had a great start and an even better ending.  Jay is approached by two men the very day she loses her job and is asked to identify her ex-spouse who was a victim of an explosion.  The chemistry between them sizzles even before they know what the other looks like.  It wasn't love at first sight as the first sight wasn't there for either of them.  It only got better.  It's a fast paced book you won't regret reading.  The best thing about LH books is that none of her books are based on constant fighting between the main characters until the end when all works out.  Her books make you feel good throughout... except Sarah's Child which I didn't really like because of the female character without a backbone.	2000-12-15

It is a very difficult book to put down.  Ms. Howard only gets better.  My second favorite was the first one, Mackenzie's Mountain then Mission, Pleasure and have to agree with other reviewer that while not bad, Magic was not as good as the others.  I'd like to see a story on Nick.  It would be great to see how her father, grandfather and uncles would deal with her love interest.  With so many offsprings, the Mackenzie stories could go on forever which I would find delightful.  A Game Of Chance is worth taking a chance on.  Ten stars if it were possible!	2000-11-01

The chemistry was outstanding.  I am currently reading the next in this trilogy, Texas Glory and it too (so far) is outstanding.  If you like books like this and while not exactly as this as these are Texans, you might enjoy 'Once a Princess' Johanna Lindsey, 'With this Kiss' Victoria Lynne and 'Ravished' Amanda Quick.  All mentioned are about men who are scarred and the beautiful women who love them.   If there are more like this out there, I don't know about them... yet.  These types are my favorites.	2000-10-20

I read 2-3 books a week and this is the best book I've read this year...  last year it was Tempting Fate by Meryl Sawyer.  There are no boring parts  in this book, great from beginning to end.  Leah out to find the  whereabouts of her sister's remains attempts to get the information from  her would be killer while he is in prison.  As she is getting closer to  finding out, he is killed.  Her only hope now is Ethan, the man who wrote  the story about this serial killer.  Although she reads the book, there is  no mention about her sister but she hopes he might have known about it but  just failed to add it to his book.  Although instantly attracted, he  struggles with wanting to help the woman but also knowing it will make him  relive painful memories.  This author makes you feel like you are there the  entire time as even the scenery is described beautifully.  I wouldn't  hesitate to pick this book up, you will not regret it.	2000-08-14

Annie  running from the law after killing James is being pursued by Lucas, James'  brother who is also a Marshall.  He catches up with her in a small town  where many have secrets but who seem to accept Annie as one of their own  (well most of them anyway), even after they learn her painful secrets.  James sets up a jail in the town to await the end of the snow and keeps her  his prisoner.  Much to his dismay he finds himself wildly attracted to this  brother killer.  It's a great story with a great ending.  At first I didn't  think there was any way this young lady was going to be able to explain  what happened and still be innocent but that's probably why I'm not the  writer...  A must read for anyone who likes Marshalls in small towns and  the woman they try to protect.	2000-07-27

When she returns to town several years later to  investigate a few things, she finds she is still crazy about Gray and he  finds her irresistible even though he knows everyone would disapprove of  their being together.  The harder he tries to rid of her from his town, the  more stubborn she becomes.  He is very crude at times but he's torn between  getting rid of her and ensuring she comes to no harm.

While I usually don't like books about psychics, this one was very acceptable  You will not get bored with this one, great from the very  beginning.  Marni feels what a serial killer is thinking and doing.  When a  woman is murdered and there are no witnesses or clues, she comes forward.   She cannot describe what the killer looks like as she is seeing the events  through the killers' eyes.  Dane, a detective investigating this case does  not believe Marni's abilities but before long cannot dispute the fact that  she knows too many details that were not released to the public.  While at  the beginning he thinks she is in some way connected to the first killing,  he comes to realize her abilities are not fake.  The attraction between the  two is outstanding.  He finds himself falling in love with her and feels it  his duty to protect her from all harm and help her through her nightmares  when the killer strikes again.  Only in books can you find a dream man like  Dane.  Great storyline without making the lead characters exasperating,  ie., he/she loves me, he/she loves me not.  This is my first Linda Howard,  what I fool I was not to have picked her books up before.	2000-07-04

Child abuse, alcohol, drugs, murder, spousal abuse, illness.  This book was one anxiety after another.  Emma a beautiful  child and then woman was mistreated as a child by her mother and as a wife.   While I liked her father Brian, he also had a major drinking problem and  his friends had their own hangups.  Michael, son of the cop investigating  the murder of Darren, half-brother to Emma, is perfect for her but it took  so long for them to figure it out.  Overall a good story.  The revelation  of one of the murderers took me by surprise, (the other one involved I  guessed pretty early on).  The ending was very good.  If you really get  into the storylines when you read; feel what the characters are feeling,  expect a little depression to come your way with this one.	2000-07-04

Serenity wanted adventure  and she got it.  She is abducted and taken to Morgan's ship.  The  attraction is there but things go awry when Morgan semi-seduces her.  I  didn't think she had any right to hold herself completely blameless but she  did.  She was very unforgiving and at times ridiculous.  Nevertheless,  Morgan understood.  This is a good story if at times frustrating.  At first  I didn't like Jake but I warmed up to him near the end.  If you like pirate  stories, don't miss this one.  My favorite pirate story still remains  'Gentle Rogue' by Johanna Lindsey.	2000-06-10

While he is not in love with Penny, he feels  she is a good match for him as he lost the woman he was first engaged to in  a hunting accident.  Penny too meek, would not be as adventerous.  His  first impression of Lily is that she is a woman with many lovers as she  acts quite the coquette.  She visits his home where her sister and family  are with the intention of getting her sister back with Zachary, the man her  sister truly loves.  Alex and Lily dislike each other but cannot fight the  attraction.  Both knowing and losing a loved one they have something in  common.  This is a great story about a man trying to get over his fiance  and a woman not willing to trust this man with her secrets.  A difficult  book to put down.  Lisa Kleypas does not disappoint her readers with this  one.  Men like Alex are the type you will never forget.  His love for Lily  was something to sigh over.	2000-05-22

I hadn't wasted my time	Berni A woman who thought only of herself during her life is sent to the 'Kitchen' a place where during your life you weren't bad enough for hell but not god enough for heaven.  She is given an assignment...Nellie.   Nellie an overweight young woman who loves her family to a fault, eats  entire cakes, pies, cookies, etc when she is distressed, which is always.   Terel, Nellie's sister is a witch at best.  She lies, slanders, demeans and  criticizes Nellie at every turn; their no better father is a penny pinching  jerk.  Nevertheless, Nellie loves them both and believes all of their lies  without question.  Nellie meets Jace a handsome guy who falls in love with  her and not Terel, much to everyone's astonishment.  While this guy loves  her, Nellie rewards him by not believing and not trusting anything he does  or says, even when the evidence is smacking her in the face.  The author  depicts Nellie as a woman overwieght by approximately 10-20 pounds.  If I  ate like her, I would be 100-200 pounds overweight.  The thing is... this  woman never stops or slows down in her eating. (If she loses weight it's  not through work or willpower).  I like to read stories where in the end  the bad guys pay for or at least acknowledge they were bad and apologize.   If this occurred, I must have missed that chapter.  Lastly, had Berni, (the  'fairy godmother') not intervened, the end result would not have occurred.   It had nothing to do with the characters 'finally opening their eyes to the  truth' on their own.  I was half expecting Nellie to be declared a saint in  the end.  I personally would have declared her something else.  How her  sister and father are 'rewarded' for their actions made me sick.  I won't  be popular with this review and I know it, but I refuse to rate it highly  if I don't think it's deserved.	2000-05-14

She finds  Jed very attractive and while he is also attracted to her, he tries to stay  away from her because he has no desire to be involved with anyone.  He  feels too much guilt over things that happened while he was an active  Captain.  She is more of the aggressor but not in a pushy way.  She sees  he's a man with much hurts to overcome and she knows she's the one to help  him through.  The dialogue between these two is incredibly funny at times.   She purchases two items from an auction and the problems begin.  The  shipment sent to this auctioneer was sent in error.  This shipment should  have gone to a very wealthy and very crooked man who will stop at  absolutely nothing to get his merchandise back.  He too is a collector of  the fine arts and antiques but he smuggles to get them.  Trying to get the  items back after they are sold at the auction is what the story is about.   A great read from beginning to end.  The ending was better than I could  have imagined.	2000-05-13

Penelope discovers wreckage from a downed plane that could have belonged to two very well known people (Colt Sinclair &amp; Frannie) who disappeared 45 years earlier, and reports it. Much to  her dismay, unwanted reporters invade her town.  She rethinks the whole  thing and decides to say it was a mistake and it was actually dump remains.   Wyatt nephew to Colt decides to visit this place as he wonders why  Penelope decided to change her story.  She doesn't want reporters or the  like invading her town or two of its members (her cousin and a recluse).   Nevertheless, Wyatt knows she is lying and tries to get her to trust him  enough to tell him the truth and take him to the site.  An investigator for  his father is also out there trying to find his own answers.  While this  investigator and the nephew are there for what seems the same thing, their  motives are different.  Penelope is a woman that seems to find herself in  mess after mess.  I'm glad Wyatt was there to help her along.  A great  read, you won't regret it and you will be surprised at how it all comes  together in the end. My first Carla Neggers book but not my last.	2000-05-12

She finds herself attracted to Reede, one of the  suspects.  Bad things happen and she is involved every time especially as  her investigation finds her closer to the murderer.  I'm not so disturbed  about the 18 years difference in ages; she's 25 and two of the suspects  (Reede &amp; Junior) are 43.  The other suspect is Junior's father.  I had  a problem accepting the fact that Reede and Junior were both involved with  her mother Celina and now wanted Alex the daughter.  One could easily have  been her stepfather had Celina not died first.  I also found that I was  angry at Reede most of the time because he was plain nasty to Alex  throughout most of the book.  I couldn't stand it that he treated her with  so much disrespect.  He's actually a good guy (deep deep down) but his mean  attitude stemmed from an overwhelming desire to avoid the daughter of the  woman he loved that had now filled his thoughts.  (At least he acknowledges  it's wrong).  Junior, in my opinion would have been better for her in some  ways as he was always kind to her, but he was such a 'Papa Pleaser'.   Lastly, a few issues were never brought to justice and I'm not talking  about the murder.  Nevertheless, the ending caught me by surprise and the  epilogue was good enought to merit the 4-1/2 star rating (Had it been  available).	2000-05-09

Abby doesn't know that she even has a grandfather,  father to her recently deceased mother Margaret, and her father doesn't  tell her.  All she knows is that they left their home in a hurry.  Tanner,  a bounty hunter is looking for Abby to take her to her very wealthy  grandfather.  Knowing only the father's name (who by the way has started  using the last name Morgan instead of Bliss as he is certain his  father-in-law would stop at nothing to get his granddaughter), he sets out  among the traveling wagons looking for the elusive heir.  When Tanner meets  Abby, after keeping her from falling in mud, they find themselves deeply  attracted to one another.  Robert does not like this 'no good outlaw'  especially since he wants his daughter to marry a dull preacher.  Tanner,  hoping to find the girl he seeks, hires on with this group as a hunter.   This way he can narrow down which of these women is really the missing  Bliss heir and at the same time flirt with the beautiful Abby.  When he  finally discovers she is the missing heir (much to his disappointment), he  takes her.  This is a great story about a man who doesn't feel he is good  enough for this prim, proper and soon to be wealthy woman although he is  quickly falling in love with her.  Abby can't help the way he makes her  feel and will stop at nothing to make this handsome and wonderfully  protective man hers.  the first Rexanne Becnel book I have had the pleasure  of reading but difinitely not my last.	2000-05-09

Knowing that he's dying makes him rethink a relationship. He  doesn't feel it would be fair to her.  As the days count down, he starts  getting sicker and sicker, losing weight, etc. I had to put the book down  several times to wipe my eyes.  I know this sounds stupid but it's the  truth.  I didn't realize this is the 4th of the Fallen Angel series.  Had I  known, I think I would have read them in order.  Instead I have to go back  and at least read the other three in order.  Thunder &amp; Roses, Dancing  on the Wind, and Shattered Rainbows are the first three.  A Perfect Rose is  the 4th.  Neverthless, this is a very good read.	2000-05-04

Holly a beauty refuses marriage proposals from countless suitors.  Her father decides to host a tournament where the bravest and strongest will have her for his bride.  Holly, together with  her nurse, concocts a scheme to make her completely undesirable.  After her  father introduces her to the crowd, many would be fighters leave and only  two are willing to fight for her.  Austyn of Gavenmore and Euguene  'something' (This guy's a jerk.  Therefore, I didn't bother to remember his  name) Austyn feels beautiful women are a curse to Gavenmore men so he  doesn't care that she is ugly.  He is interested in the large dowry that  comes with her to restore his castle and pay back debt created by his  ancestors.  I'm not giving anything away here when I say he wins, that is  obvious.  She decides to continue hiding her beauty hoping he will leave  her alone as she has heard terrible things about the consummation of the  marriage.  A woman with outer beauty (albeit hidden) attempts to win her  man's love via inner beauty, her heart. It is a wonderful story.  The  ending is much better than I had hoped for.	2000-04-26

Mitch, a criminal attorney with a very sad past and Royce, a columnist who hates him because he convicted her father 5 years prior.  She's accused of theft and he's there to defend her.  I usually figure who  is the villian in most books but this one fooled me.  I didn't like it that  Royce's uncle conducted an investigation on Mitch even though he  specifically told Royce not to do it.  Right... Royce didn't do it but she  didn't demand her uncle seize.  That was the least she could do as she  couldn't afford his attorney fees.  Nevertheless, it made for a good story.   I loved it that they had this chemistry that neither could deny, hard as  they tried.  I recommend this book to anyone who can find it, although,  Tempting Fate is still my favorite.	2000-04-23

Diana Wells is accused of killing Travis, the father of her adopted son Zack.  He doesn't really want the child and in fact dislikes children but he will not inherit his  mother's shares of the Linford Hotel without him.  Kane Sanders, attorney  and friend to Travis' mother Margaret agrees to try to help get custody of  the boy.  When he meets Diana, he is immediately attracted to her and she  to him.  He ultimately decides to defend Diana against the murder.  The  murderer is revealed early on but as we the readers know what really  happened, they don't.  Therefore, the investigation.  The ending is better  than I could have imagined. I have read most of Ms. Heggan's books and have  yet to be disappointed.  She is an incredible storyteller.  Don't miss this  one.

I don't understand why so many readers didn't like this one. I thought it was great how Luke protected Tasia.  They both needed each other.  He needed to get  over his first wife and she needed someone to love her.  I enjoyed knowing  that although he didn't know who she really was, he fell in love with her  thinking she was just a governess.  Emma, the tall redheaded daughter was  delightful.  I loved it that she didn't like Luke's mistress the haughty  bit--.  I'm glad she was put in her place early on.  Overall, I think it  was a good storyline.  I'm glad I decided to judge this book for myself and  read it.  The reviews for A Stranger In My Arms weren't that good either,  but I'm glad I read that one too.  Of course, my favorites were Someone to  Watch Over Me and Dreaming of You.  I don't think I will read Prince of  Dreams, the sequel as it is a time travel with reincarnation (at least that  is what the reviewers are saying).  I'll stick to non-fantasy.	2000-04-18

I loved it that two sisters fall in love with two  very wonderful men.  Both started out with revenge in their minds but upon  meeting the daughters of the man they seek revenge from, they decide to  &quot;wait a while&quot;.  Life would be boring if there wasn't someone out  there trying to make it difficult.  In this case it's Jeremy an idiot who  wants the fortune either of these beauties can bring to him.  Never a dull  moment in this book.  Once you pick it up, you will be hard pressed to put  it down. As the book comes to an end, you may find you want to read faster  just to find what happens next.   The ending is outstanding, it's better  than I imagined.  I wish Ms. Van Nuys would write a book about Mac, the  friend who is like a brother to Aisha.  Nevertheless, you won't be  disappointed if you find and purchase this out of print book.  I would try  used paperback book stores or even Amazon's auctions.	2000-04-17

One reviewer stated the fact that Molly had blood all over  her wasn't explained.  It was... as she remembers bits at a time she  remembers trying to revive her husband.  Yes, there are so many characters  involved and so many twists that it can be difficult to remember who did  what but in the end, all of the loose ends tie together.  It could not have  ended better...I was shocked to find who actually killed Gary.  I had  always felt that this authors' earlier books were the best and after a  while I stopped reading the newer ones.  In my opinion, this one reminded  me of her older books, outstanding reads that are worth your time. Give it  a try, judge for yourself.	2000-04-17

I could not believe the violence in this story.  Also, I never heard of a Maje and it is too incredible to even attempt to believe.  People who heal the wounded  and take their pain?  Leyla made me angry at best during the entire story.   How, after seeing how her man was treated by the different people, did she  insist their lives be spared! Please!  Jarrett has got to be the bigger  fool to allow her to sway him.  This was too much for me.  I like stories  that are believable.  This was ridiculous.

Hope, a doctor, had to leave her home in Pittsburgh after being accused of something she had no control over.  She and her father Thomas flee to Shenango Valley, land surrounded by Indians.  Hope meets Flower, sister to Firewalker, an Indian warrior who hates whites  due to what some did to his people.  Although he is curt with Hope  everytime they see each other, she slowly breaks the ice around his heart.   Of course, life isn't simple... Jacques D'Arcy a Frenchman finds he is  deeply attracted to beautiful Hope but is also out for gain.  He sees she  and her father come from wealth and that is the main attraction.  Hope's  trust in men is shattered as she was previously engaged to a man in  Pennsylvania who elected not to stand by her in her time of need. (good  riddence I say).  Hope cannot ignore the fact that she is highly attracted  to the handsome Indian Firewalker.  It only gets better.  What I absolutely  loved about this book is that while there were misunderstandings, they  didn't carry on to the very last page when finally all works out.  I  appreciate the fact that Ms. Van Nuys knows her readers in the end want to  read at least one chapter, instead of the last paragraph where the tension  is over.  Not a disappointment.  I definitely recommend this book.  It may  be hard to find as it is out of print but I found it at a used book store.	2000-04-03

This book is hard to  find but where there's a will, there's a way.  I purchased it because of  the reviews by other readers.

I  have to agree with the reader from Washington 3/20/00 and the reader from  Ohio, 11/17/99.  (I'd probably find myself agreeing with others but I don't  want to read all 400+ reviews.) This is one of those books you either love  or hate, From the reviews I read, I really don't think there's a middle  ground.  I did not like it one iota.

Derek, a man who grew up in the streets among thiefs, prostitutes, etc. becomes a wealthy man as the owner of an exclusive gaming club.  Sara is a writer who wants to learn all she can about gaming clubs to add to her next book.  He  doesn't feel he's good enough for her and therefore does not allow himself  to get close to her.  She loves him and want him to &quot;show her what  love is all about&quot; but he refuses to allow her to &quot;settle for  someone like him&quot;.  I absolutely love books where the man feels he's  unworthy of his lady love.  The ending was so touching it made me want to  cry.  A perfect match as Derek and Sara needed each other...for their own  particular reasons. They completed each other.  This is the sequel to  &quot;Then Came You&quot;.

I can understand that his first wife lied to him but to constantly take it out on Lisette was  incredible.  I have to say that I would have told him to take a hike.  One  thing I have to say is that I would definitely give this book five stars  for the ending.  It's been a while since a story's ending made it very hard  for me to swallow, what with that lump in my throat.  The back of the book  states that there are sequels to this one.  I find by reading the synopsis  on Lone Star Loving and Wild Sierra Rogue that they are two of the three.   I wish I knew the order.

While the trilogy is about three brothers (Cameron, Ethan &amp; Phillip) Seth, the youngest  brother's story begins in Sea Swept and ends in Inner Harbor.  Reading only  the first or second book of this series will leave many questions  unanswered.  I found I enjoyed Inner Harbor the most.  Not only because  everything is settled in this book but because I found the chemistry  between Phillip and Sybill outstanding.  Even when his brothers (mostly  Cameron) were angry with her, he gave her the benefit of the doubt to hear  her out.  To me, although she wasn't what she portrayed to be in the  beginning, she unselfishly wanted only the best for Seth.  I have also read  the &quot;Born In..&quot; and the &quot;Dream..&quot; series by Nora  Roberts but I think she outdid herself with this one.  I've read the last  couple pages of Inner Harbor over and over because I loved the ending.	2000-02-13

It is because of this one that I decided to  read more of JD's books.  If you liked this one you should try Judith  McNaught as this book was written in her style... Man meets woman, man and  woman fall in love, trouble and misunderstandings... man and woman  separate... misunderstandings resolved, and in the end, back together  again.

There were plenty of very amusing parts that made me  chuckle but many that were also frustrating.  This couple attracted trouble  like magnets.  For a knight who constantly felt he was a coward, I would  sure like this &quot;coward&quot; on my side.

I enjoyed how he tried to protect her even when she  wouldn't be seen with him.  By the way, I didn't know that animals can be  treated as badly as some mentioned in this book.

Usually the first in the trilogies is the best but not in this case, at least not for me.  There is something about men who don't think they're good enough for their love interest that  captures my heart.  Michael Fury friend to Josh, Laura's brother is renting  a place with stables at the Templetons.  Laura who was mistreated by her  first husband is in my opinion, the sweetest of the three friends.  I love  the connection they make.  The entire story was interesting and  heartwarming as Laura's daughters connect with this father figure.   I only  wish that not all of Ms. Robert's stories have the couple realizing they  are both in love until the last page of the book.

Johanna Lindsey is a great author.  The only books I don't like that are  hers are the ones set in the future, ie., Keeper of the Heart.  I was going  to purchase Warrior's Woman but when I found it was another into the future  book, I passed.  Otherwise, I have almost all of her books.	1999-11-06

I turly enjoy reading books by Judith McNaught.  I had lumps in my throat througout the book.  The misunderstandings nearly killed me but in the end all worked  out.  I especially enjoyed the last chapters.  Most couples don't come  together until the very end.  The bickering ends and the story is over...   I really enjoyed that this one had a few chapters of happiness, for them  and me.	1999-11-06

Although I didn't really like all of Christina's lies, I liked it that Lyon knew it.  I especially liked the fact that the beginning  of each chapter began with a portion of Christina's moms diary.  Have to  say I hated Patricia the aunt; the battle axe! I wouldn't give her a penny!	1999-09-14

I love it when the warriors are hard, mean and hardly ever even smile but they fall in love hard with their women.  I laughed  throughout the book at the crazy things Madelyne did.  Especially learning  the bow and arrow.  Once again Julie Garwood has not disappointed me.   Unfortunately I have read most of her books now and I now compare other  authors to her which is really not fair...she's the best.	1999-09-14
US	51311268	ROK2583U1B6UI	0440206251	665653781	Tempted	Books	2	7	13	N	N	Language too vulgar	This is the first and last book I will read from this author.  I didn't like the crude language used.  F--k instead of make love.. c---k instead of... anything else to describe a man's privates. Also, Valentina was so nasty to Ram and her desire for revenge.  I also don't like ghosts that  talk and card readers that tell one's fortune.  Too much supernatural for  me.   This is one book that will not remain in my collection.	1999-09-09
US	51311268	R1RBTCVD0ODPTP	0553293168	675345837	Ravished	Books	5	0	1	N	N	A great read!	I really enjoyed this book.  I thought Gideon and Harriet were perfect together.  I enjoy reading books where the man is scarred and the women see past that flaw.  The first book I read where the guy was scarred and the woman saw past it was Once a Princess by Johanna Lindsey, which by the way  I think everyone should read... Nevertheless, I liked it that Gideon always  tried to protect his Harriet.  I did not like that housekeeper that was  always fainting.  I would have fired her the first time she called Gideon a  beast.  Beauty is only skin deep.  I'll take a heart of gold over good  looks any day.  I'm glad Harriet trusted him. The poor guy needed someone  in his corner.	1999-09-09

I thought Derek was a wonderful and sweet man to Kelsey.  It was nice to see that he wanted to protect her from the likes of that  other bidder, (I can't remember his name).  I know that he didn't fit the  mold as the other Malory men as he was gentle from the beginning but I  suppose that is why I really enjoyed it.  The Malory men never want to  admit they're in love and sometimes that is exasperating.  I would like to  read Jeremy's story because he also has a soft spot.  After all, he is  James' son.	1999-08-31

I was disappointed. No where on the book cover was I alerted to the fact that this was going to be a story about robots, talking computers that can also  transfer people from one location to another in seconds, androids, and  traveling from one planet to another in airbuses.  I kept looking at the  cover wondering if the publishers mistakenly put that cover on a sequel to  Star Wars with a mix of the cartoon The Jetsons.  I could not get into this  book but I was determined to finish it.  But as Falon stated throughout the  book, &quot;You are welcome to try.&quot;  The only reason I gave this book  3 stars is because I cannot give Johanna Lindsey's work anything lower,  most of her other books are outstanding.  As I read most of the reviews  listed here, I know my opinion will not be appreciated.  So be it.	1999-08-12
US	51311268	R1V4JYK6VNTRCU	0380782332	489354413	Kiss an Angel	Books	5	1	3	N	Y	A great read!	I usually read Historical Romance novels and actually thoughtthis would also be one.  It was great anyway.  I did get mad at Alexseveral times because he was so mean to Daisy who was nothing but sweet and trying to make a go at their marriage.  I don't like it when people are quick to believe the worst in others.  I gave it five stars because the story was really good and the ending was better than I expected.	1999-08-10

I read that one first, good thing, because I hate to read books out of order. I enjoyed reading more about Devlin and Megan.  This one is about Lachlan and Kimberly.  Laughlan  fell in love with Megan when he met her in Man of My Dreams, but ultimately  Kimberly won his heart in this one.  The picture on the paperback book  cover should have had a better looking couple, I think.   I had to make a  mental note to picture them as I would like them to look, it's difficult.	1999-08-10

I read Angel first which was a mistake as I realized that it was the sequel to Savage Thunder.  In certain sections where I would normally have been guessing the outcome, I knew as Angel told bits and pieces.  While  Colt made me angry at times at his unbending ways, I knew it would be a  great ending and well worth my time.	1999-08-10

Johanna Lindsey is my all time favorite author.  That's why I read romance novels, because they are passionate and you get lost in them and forget about the real world.  I  will keep this one in my collection.  Warrick was a mans man and Rowena a  perfect partner for him.	1999-08-10

I suppose I just couldn't get past the &quot;sweetkens&quot; endearment and the constant mistrust of Heath even though he did nothing but help Meredith.  Her account of how Dan treated her... spiders and guns during  intimacy was too much for me to believe.  I did like Sammy and Goliath.  I  do love dogs.  Just my opinion.	1999-08-10

The author was recommended by a very good friend of mine in Atlanta, GA.  This was one of those books you wish would never end.  I loved the chemistry between Lady Johanna and  Gabriel,(the Archangel).  Many books have the couple fighting and bickering  throughout until all is resolved in the end.  Not so with this one.  It was  so outstanding.  I wish Julie Garwood would write a book about Nicholas  (Lady Johanna's brother) and Clare.  I love it when the men are big, brave  and ruthless and also possess huge and loving hearts!	1999-08-10

It was hard for me to follow trying to remember all the names and titles.  Nevertheless, I'm glad I continued reading, it was worth it.  Varian was a guy who's reputation  was marred by his stupid uncle.  I'm glad Nyssa didn't shun him as others  had.  He just wanted to be loved as he should be! I didn't realize that  most of the facts less the Varian and Nyssa story was true.  So I'm not a  historian.	1999-08-10

I have to admit I wanted more than anything for Angel to be happy.  It broke my heart when he felt that Cassie would never want a man like him.  All he wanted was to be wanted and  not feared.  My favorite part was when he asked her if &quot;they&quot;  touched her and she said no, they weren't attracted to her and he saying  they must be blind.  What a sweetheart he was.  I have to admit that I  wasn't very happy with her mother for some time.  I didn't like it that she  tried to tell Cassie what to do with HER life.  As all of JL's books, the  endings are incredible.	1999-07-20

You can't help but love James Malory from the very beginning.  Especially after how angry he became when a sailor hit Georgie in the ear!  Gotta love it!   He was such a Gentle Rogue.  I couldn't put it down for anything.  I HAVE  TO THANK THE OTHER READERS THAT RATED THIS BOOK SO HIGHLY.  I purchased  this book based on their recommendation and I was not disappointed in the  very least!	1999-07-16

I really enjoyed this one also.  I couldn't put it down and was disappointed that it ended; not that it was a bad  ending, it was a great ending, I just didn't want it to end.  Jared  irritated me but he had his reasons for being an angry man.  He was the  perfect man for Corrine.  I did hate Russell.  What a jerk.	1999-07-14

Usually there are so many misunderstandings or one or the other of the main characters does not want to admit their feelings for the other but nothing like that happened  here.  Yes it's a true romance but that's it.  Shay was very bold at the  cabin and Ian was too proper.  I'm glad they loved each other from the  beginning but there were no surprises.  I've read better books by Sandra  Brown.	1999-07-14

Now I have to go out and buy all of the other ones that are rated highly by the readers.  I really enjoyed it.  I never finish a book in one day but I did this one.  This is the first book that  made me neglect my household duties for a day, luckily it was a holiday  weekend and I still had Monday.  Garrick and Brenna were a wonderful match.  If you like books that are good right from the beginning, I recommend this  one!  I especially loved it when Garrick called her Brenna and not  mistress.  I love it when couples try to resist each other but fail  miserably.	1999-07-07

Having parents that clearly preferred the other son must be a terrible thing.  Shame on the parents!!  I was happy that Jenny treated him special as no own else did.  I think  they made a perfect couple and I'm thrilled I read it.  I enjoyed this one  as much as I enjoyed Mirror Image which is/was my very favorite Sandra  Brown book.  Mirror Image is my favorite romanctic suspense, while Led  Astray is my favorite romance.	1999-06-26

Without disclosing much, I don't understand why Josh wanted a mail order bride.  His current situation wasn't permanent!  Were  his intentions to divorce this mail order bride in a year?  His true  identity was too much for me.  I realize it's just a story, but it was too  sappy for me.  I would not recommend this one.. too many good books out  there that are truly worth the time and money.	1999-06-26

Her style reminds me of the earlier books of Mary Higgins Clark, which I felt were her best.  I absolutely loved the ending... especially  when I thought I &quot;knew&quot; how it would end and found I was wrong,  happily wrong.	1999-04-29
