US	49244843	R255CSK6N9KZLU	1896941435	391980376	Century of Service: The History of the South Alberta Light Horse	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Without Peer	Donald Graves' history of the South Alberta Regiment in World War Two is acclaimed as one of the best WW II regimental histories yet written.  This history, of the South Alberta Light Horse, is just as good, and offers a substantially wider view, looking in detail at the SALH from inception to the present, 1905 to 2005 (hence the title). <br /> <br />The book is substantially more than that, however.  The SALH result from several postwar amalgamations, and therefore the book provides a detailed history of the 31st Battalion in World War One, the 13th Field Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery and the South Alberta Regiment in World War Two.  Aside from the history of these combat units, the peacetime service of the 15th Alberta Light Horse, 19th Alberta Dragoons, South Alberta Regiment, and others is told in some detail, as well as the story of the many cavalry units in Southern Alberta from inception through the First World War and into the 1920s reorganizations of the Militia, as well as stay-home Militia units in WW II such as the 31st Recce Regiment. <br /> <br />Graves does not just start his story in 1905, however, and traces the history of the Militia in Alberta back to its starting points. <br /> <br />Despite covering all this ground, the book is laid out in several distinct chapters, broken up with interesting sub-paragraph headings and always written so the reader knows exactly which unit is being discussed. <br /> <br />The prose is lucid, meeting the tenets of good historical reporting using period terminology (yet avoiding abbreviations that would confuse the layman) and remaining conversational and even light in tone.  To that end, despite the richness of detail and abundance of academic footnotes, Graves has very much made this book - like the SAR history - storylike in tone, making maximum use of personal anecdotes to illustrate points. <br /> <br />And those points are well covered - Graves discusses many themes in detail - for the combat units, he sketches out methods of employment, conditions for the average soldier and the officers in charge of them, and places their battles into the overall larger context demanded.  He does the same thing with peacetime history, providing the political context of how and why the Militia evolved, what its purpose was, and how the SALH and predecessors went about meeting its objectives. <br /> <br />The book can't be praised highly enough for being a comprehensive look at not just one regiment, but the histories of many Alberta militia regiments and how they reflected on the Canadian Army as a whole. <br /> <br />Colour photos and plates by the superb Ron Volstad bring the subject matter to life, though they are unfortunately few in number.  The mass of black and white photos are unpublished and extremely well captioned, each caption being more of a sidebar to the main text than simple explanatory piece of the picture itself.  The photos have been carefully selected to maximize the understanding of the reader and make him relate to the story being told. <br /> <br />Additionally, Chris Johnston's line drawings are here in abundance, a very welcome treat, including such rarities as the loading layout for LCTs of the the 13th Field Regiment (self propelled) on D-Day, and a look at the rare ammunition sledges they towed into action on 6 June.  There is much in this book for not just devotees of regimental history, but wargamers, general interest historians, armour buffs and more. <br /> <br />The maps (all thirty of them) are also superb and in appropriate quantity to illustrate the text fully. <br /> <br />This book will give the general interest reader a deep understanding of what it was like to be in a cavalry or infantry unit in the First World War, in the Militia in the mid and post war eras, in an armoured or artillery regiment in Normandy and NW Europe, and paints a vivid picture of life in the Militia today. <br /> <br />Extensive appendices include Rolls of Honour for the pertinent units, lists of Battle Honours of same, Major awards and decorations from 1914 to 1945, Commanding Officers and RSMs of the SALH, national and command competitions won in the postwar era, a complete lineage of the SALH, Commanding Officers of the predecessor units, and a listing of Canadian Expetionary Force units raised in Alberta.  <br /> <br />The colour photo section includes a nice layout of insignia of all predecessor units. <br /> <br />And, a full glossary is included.  Sadly, no battle manual as in the SAR history, but Graves has a real grasp of the mechanics of how these infantry, cavalry, artillery and armoured regiments \\"did business\\" and this comes through in the text and photo captions. <br /> <br />This book can not be bettered by any regimental history in the foreseeable future.	2005-06-21

For those up to the challenge, Atkinson is able to provide vivid descriptions with a minimum of words - though some of those words may make you scramble for the Funk and Wagnall's. <br /> <br />Other comments are all valid; this is a very close look at the divisional command staff, with one or two lower level portraits, including a touching one of a sergeant killed in action.  It is also a very personal story of Atkinson's own experiences as an imbedded journalist, so there are a couple of different perspectives at play here. <br /> <br />Good clear picture of what the 101st was doing in Iraq - viewed from the top.	2005-05-31

While the history of the South Alberta Regiment (and the newest title about the South Alberta Light Horse, both by Donald Graves) had raised the standard for Regimental histories, this book does the same for Operational studies.    This book is an in-depth examination of OPERATION TOTALIZE, one of many operations launched by the Canadian Army in Normandy, this one in the second week of August 1944.  TOTALIZE, like many other operations (Spring, Atlantic, et al) has been much written about, and subject to much controversy.  Reid takes a very fresh approach to the subject and dissects the planning and execution of this action very skillfully.    Reid is nothing like Zuehlke - while the latter simply poured out a trilogy of recycled secondary sources, Reid has dug deep to seriously question our current understanding of why this operation took place, and why it evolved as it did.    Reid starts at the beginning - with an impressive look at the training and employment of staff officers in the Canadian Army (following on in Granatstein's footsteps, who first broached the subject for public consumption with THE GENERALS), a look at how the Canadian Army developed in peace, and in war.  It may seem to be an apologist approach, but I think it is necessary to appreciate the capabilities of the Canadian Army in Normandy, and adds to fuller understanding.    Every chapter is rich in detail - from identifying who drove the first Kangaroo APCs to a detailed analysis of Simond's written appreciation and outline plan, as submitted to General Crerar.      TOTALIZE was unique in that it was a large armoured attack launched at night (not common in doctrine at that time, though not untried, either), with the first use of a fully tracked and armoured APC to move the troops forward, as well as heavy bombing used tactically.  Reid looks at all this in detail.    The maps in this volume are among the best ever published in support of an operational history.  Chris Johnson has once again also worked his magic with many line drawings of the armour and vehicles used in the campaign, both Canadian and German.  Many good photos also complement the text.    There is even a well developed chapter about \\"who got Wittman\\" - with not just a map, but a topographical map showing elevations.  Great fodder for tactical game scenario designers.  Other appendices include a complete history of 1 Polish Armoured Division (with order of battle and even rank structure) as well as a treatise on airpower and a breakdown of German and Allied order of battle.    Overall one of the best operational studies yet written about the Canadian Army in Normandy.  May have benefitted from aerial photography, but hard to fault the book in any other way.  Can't recommend this highly enough not just for an understanding of TOTALIZE, but for anyone interested in the debate about just how good the Canadian Army was in the Second World War.	2005-05-27

Johnson played games as a kid, baseball strategy games, as well as Dungeons and Dragons, and one can detect a certain bias in his outlook.  However, his statistical references and footnotes make this book a scholarly look at popular culture - in particular movies, TV and videogames - and is a nice refutation of the \\"our culture is going into the toilet\\" crowd.    Johnson argues - to me, convincingly - that even though modern mass market entertainment may appear \\"dumbed down\\", it really isn't, and that at a basic physical level, our brains are being made to work harder, get more exercise if you will, and develop higher cognitive functions as a result.    A very complex book written in easy to read language with convincing data to back up the arguments - disguised in a very palatable dialogue that doesn't seem like science at all.  He even takes Marshall McLuhan to task on at least one of his conclusions - very daring, and in this case, pays off.    Johnson does miss out on one or two things - the ascendance of message boards is glossed over, or perhaps incorporated into \\"Internet\\" \\"email\\" and \\"IMs\\" in the discussion of why males watch about 1/5 as much TV as they did as little as five years ago.    As a fellow who grew up playing Advanced Squad Leader (arguably a set of rules even more dense than AD&D), I could relate to his argument that kids will learn horribly complex procedures in the name of fun (as he did with his baseball games and D&D sets) and may very well be better for it.    Overall, even if one disagrees with Johnson's arguments or conclusions, the book is fun to read; brings back memories for those who grew up in the 70s and 80s, presents logical arguments, well constructed, easy to understand, and supported by corroborating evidence - including scientific testimony about how the physical (hi Shannon) human brain works.  Would love to read a rebuttal, though Johnson has personally sold me over hook, line and sinker.  If nothing else, a comforting book amidst doom and gloom prophesies about the fate of our intellect in the hands of TV producers.  Well done, Mr. Johnson.	2005-05-13

Colonel Stacey's official reports during WW II are no secret to serious Canadian Army researchers (and are available for free online at the DND website); what Clive and Doug have done is synthesize these reports masterfully into a very readable and informative book covering small arms, ordnance and weapons commonly used by the Canadian Army.  Highlighting this volume are many unpublished photos, all of high quality. <br /> <br />For the price of admission, this book is well worth it.  One hopes to see an expanded version some day, perhaps with colour photos of surviving contemporary artifacts, but as is, this is a great reference.	2005-04-22

Grantstein's years of research in the field (not to mention his own military experience, which comes to the fore for the first time) have culminated in this very well done survey of how the Canadian military has evolved in the last 100 years.    The book is straightforward, written in simple language, and is logically laid out into several distinct \\"eras\\".  He discusses both the military atttitudes of the time, and the policies of the government.  He is even handed (for instance, he concedes many of the positive aspects of integration while at the same time identifying the harmful effects of Unification) and at the same time ruthless.    Unlike many critiques, Granatstein ends up with some constructive suggestions.  Readers might like to compare and contrast his conclusions with those in TARNISHED BRASS, which also has a prescription for reviving the military.    The latest version of this book carries us up to Paul Martin's election victory and is therefore rather current.      Recommended, probably moreso than Bercuson's SIGNIFICANT INCIDENT which also covers the same topic, and much less muckracking that TARNISHED BRASS.	2005-02-13

The other review for this book covers many points well and I won't repeat them here. <br /> <br />Some other points of my own - a lack of decent maps, though the reproduction of wartime maps (with contour lines) is a nice touch.  The book is very much representative of the 'golden age' of regimental histories.  First produced in 1947, the book is similar to many Canadian regimental histories of that age, in which surviving members wrote their histories, aimed mainly at pleasing their old buddies from the unit.  I don't wish to demean Burhan's purpose - I have no doubt he, like many regimental historians, desired to leave as accurate a portrayal of his unit as was possible.  However, many histories written so soon after the war - and this is no exception - were careful not to tread on the memories of men recently departed, and so real criticism is not often apparent.  The desire was not just to paint all members in a good light, but to avoid casting doubt that the men who died had done so nobly and for a good cause. <br /> <br />So the reader is charged to be cautious - basic information on locations and actions are provided, and some small vignettes are sketched out, but no real deep analysis of the unit's performance is given.  Needless to say, research into the German side of the story is non-existent, again, typical for histories written in this period. <br /> <br />The book is more of a tribute to the Force, and as such, it is a fitting one.  Other, more recent books (such as Adleman's THE DEVIL'S BRIGADE written in the 1960s, or even the pictorial SUPERCOMMANDOS) give a more balanced presentation. <br /> <br />Many good photos, though disappointingly reproduction quality is poor. <br /> <br />Probably the best day for day history of the Force if that is all that you require.	2005-01-31
US	49244843	R3T5BWCFGINNON	1400034620	599805840	Case Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of JFK	Books	4	14	23	N	N	Open Minded	I have read many of the conspiracy based books, from the sublime (Garrison's ON THE TRAIL OF THE ASSASSINS) to the ridiculous (Lifton's suggestion that the body of JFK was surgically altered before the autopsy).  I too strongly believed that a conspiracy was responsible, and I enjoyed the film JFK. <br /> <br />However, I think Posner does a very good job of refuting many of the conspiracy theories, even those approaching credibility.  The book, as pointed out by other reviewers here, is not perfect.  And I admit I don't have a firm grasp on the minutiae of the case that has propelled so many theorists into infamy.  However, on a basic \\"gut\\" level, the book feels right. <br /> <br />My endorsement of the book goes beyond feelings (and the fact that I have known people with Oswald's personality problems and could very well see them performing similarly infamous acts, given the opportunity).  The case is made with solid documentary evidence, though much of it comes from the Warren Report itself (which may invalidate it in the eyes of the harshest critics.) <br /> <br />New research, such as Max Holland is doing with the LBJ tapes, is bringing much to light, and the passing of Jacqueline Kennedy and John Kennedy Junior may hasten the opening of some files within my lifetime.  It is hard to imagine that these files would contain anything startlingly out of synch with the \\"official\\" explanation behind the assassination. <br /> <br />Posner does expect the reader to have a working knowledge of some facets of the case beyond that of the layman, so be advised the book may not be aimed at them.  The language is not overly scholarly or dense, however, and there are some interesting appendices, diagrams and photographs to support some of the discussion. <br /> <br />The book is logically organized into different areas of interest, and is easily read. <br /> <br />The book may seem superficial to entrenched conspiracy theorists, who would probably need a more detailed point-by-point rebuttal of their pet theories, which is fine.  As a general knowledge book, I think Case Closed successfully demolishes several theories quite handily, though in a very generalized manner.  Posner could be busy for the next 99 years if he decided to refute each single theory or book about the assassination one by one. <br /> <br />Given the amount of ink that has been spilled over this issue, no single volume could ever hope to refute all that has been written.  Nor is it likely that one single volume (and several have been written making the attempt) can refute CASE CLOSED either. <br /> <br />Recommended to all, whether you are a conspiracry theorist, a backer of the Warren Commission, or honestly undecided or completely ignorant of the entire case.  All you need is an open mind to get value from the book.	2005-01-31

The text is well footnoted and primary source material is used well.  One might wonder why there is so much reliance on Manchester's \\"Death of a President\\", as that is a secondary source, but having read Manchester's autobiography, as well as his book on General MacArthur, I have little doubt that his book is as good a reference as any and is no doubt solidly researched itself. <br /> <br />What does this book do?  There is no inside look at the JFK assassination nor LBJ's involvement in the investigation of some (and anyone believing that a \\"smoking gun\\" might point to LBJ's involvement in the actual crime itself will be sorely disappointed.\\"  The author presents the story from a non-conspiracy point of view, and what the book does is describe Johnson's political maneuverings in the immediate wake of the assasination - and then talks about how he put together the Warren Commission.  Johnson, in actual fact, knows virtually nothing of the details of the crime that took place and seems not interested - that is, in the end, why he started the commission in the first place. <br /> <br />So anyone hoping to read a real thriller will be disappointed.  What the book does do is provide a look at the relationships between Johnson and all the branches of government as well as the various agencies at his command - Secret Service, FBI, CIA etc.  The book is recommended to those with an above average understanding of how the government of the US was organized in the 1960s, however, even a layman such as myself found it interesting.  My own personal bias comes from having read Groden, Lane, Garrison on the conspiracy theories but eventually being convinced by Posner that the Warren Commission had it right.   <br /> <br />Holland seems to proceed from thesame conclusions. <br /> <br />The book is thus not going to entertain those who enjoy the conspiracy books, but will probably appeal more to those that are interested in Johnson as a historical character (his personality is very much evident), or those interested in how the Warren Commission was formed. <br /> <br />The book presents an almost minute to minute look at Johnson's first days as the President, then shifts to cover entire months at a time by focussing solely on assasination-related work.  An interesting focus which will also not please those looking for a broad overview of Johnson's presidency.  However, having said that, Holland does provide very good historial synopses and does take pains to make the uninitiated reader understand the significance of eacy person mentioned and their relationship to Johnson, the Commission, and each other.   <br /> <br />Only problem with sources is a reliance on newspaper articles from which Holland seems to draw a lot of conclusions.  A minor point, perhaps. <br /> <br />Very readable nonetheless, but true value to you, as with any book, will depend on what you expect to get out of it.	2005-01-29

It wouldn't be so bad, if he wasn't quoting the contentious FORGOTTEN SOLDIER. Fritz adds nothing new to the discussion of German soldiers in the Second World War, and readers are advised to turn to other material, such as SOLDAT by Siegfried Knappe.      FRONTSOLDATEN is simply a collection of quotes from dubious sources - and all secondary ones at that. Fritz does not appear to have conducted a single interview on his own. How then can he claim to have any kind of grasp on what it was like to be a German soldier, if he's never actually talked to one?     This book is not \\"scholarly\\" as some claim, as scholarship generally insists on multiple documentary sources, and a modicum of primary research.  Fritz didn't research this book - he cribbed it from other sources.     Readers serious about the German military in the Second World War will have to wait for a definitive book on the Landser to appear in English.	2004-12-08
US	49244843	R1G6Z2Q6TGZ6BW	1894413199	609762508	Canadian History for Dummies	Books	2	10	27	N	N	Fails to Convey Importance of Military History	I am reviewing this book from the standpoint of military history.  With that in mind, I rate this book as a two.  While it is written in a style conducive to imparting informaton to newcomers to the field, it unfortunately concentrates far too much emphasis on the wrong areas.  I'm speaking specifically of the Second World War chapter; Canada played a vital role in three major operations in NW Europe - Normandy, the Scheldt and the Rhineland.  Normandy is mentioned in passing and the latter two are not mentioned at all.   <br /> <br />The focus of the chapter is on Dieppe - two entire pages.  While Dieppe is of course a focus of national attention, it was not the only chapter in military history and the book is very misleading by suggesting that it was.  Canada had five divisions in the field by 1944, fighting for 22 months in Italy and 11 months in NW Europe.  Why a 9 hour battle would get two pages and some 33 months of fighting get only a brief paragraph describing the casualty rates in Italy is beyond comprehension. <br /> <br />A page is also devoted to Conscription - and the information presented is accurate and again, well written - but again highlights failed policy rather than successful military operations.  Another two pages are devoted to the Internment camps and the Holocaust.  Important subjects, but again done at the expense of our positive military achievements. <br /> <br />The Battle of Normandy destroyed the German Army in France beyond recovery.  The Battle of the Scheldt cleared the waterways to Antwerp and allowed desperately needed supplies onto the continent at a location much closer to the front (the Allies were using more gasoline trucking supplies from the Normandy beachhead than the gasoline they were using for fighting).  The Battle of the Rhineland paved the way for the final crossing of the last major obstacle to a general Allied advance into Germany itself.  These were dramatic battles in which Canadians paid a grave cost and yet acquitted itself very well.  None of this is mentioned in the book, and those truly ignorant of history - the people this book is aimed at - would have no clue what the Canadian military achieved and instead walk away with the understanding that Canada's WW II effort was largely a litany of failed political decisions, interspersed with the occasional massacre of our own men. <br /> <br />Disappointing, especially since other areas are covered in better detail by the same author.  Perhaps the fault lies with the editor, but either way, I recommend caution in purchasing this book, especially if interested in military history.	2004-10-16

As mentioned, it is not for the faint of heart, however, it is the most innovative system in terms of the rules themselves, but also the actual physical layout of the rules themselves.  They are kept in a 3 ring binder like a military field manual and pages can be replaced as they are updated and amended through official errata, playtesting, and feedback from consumers. <br /> <br />The rulebook is now in its 2nd Edition.  This is the most detailed set of rules for representing WW II tactical combat at the company and battalion level ever devised.  The many follow on modules also represent just about every nationality and theatre of war including NW Europe, North Africa, the Med, the Pacific, the Far East, and the Eastern Front. <br /> <br />The modules are expensive, but are very open ended. <br /> <br />Also be advised that ownership of these rules can have you playing VASL online through a javascript program, a very handy program that is freeware.	2004-10-10

Very well written.  Williamson is no stranger to German military subjects, though most of his works seem to deal in general, broad strokes - see his INFANTRY ACES OF THE THIRD REICH for example.  Some good (secondary) research has been done - more on this later, however. <br /> <br />Colour plates - very well done.  Vuksic needs to work on his human faces, but he major depictions of vehicles and equipment and uniforms are above average.  Minor research error in plate G; the NCO is depicted wearing gold or yellow metal cyphers and stars on the shoulder straps; these should naturally be silver or white metal.  However, compare to the excellent use of colour in, for example, the jackboot in plate A - Vuksic approaches photo-realistic quality in many of his depictions.   The vignettes were effective also, especially the final one with the bailed out tank crew. <br /> <br />The text focusses on several major topics; again, there is little new covered here though some nuggets may be of value to panzer buffs.  The geographical recruitment table was to me a nice touch, eithers may view it as a waste of space.  The space devoted to \\"elite\\" panzer units seemed like a waste given that some were not mentioned at all (Panzer Lehr for example!), and other notables like 24 Panzer Division (nee 1 Kavallerie Division) are not mentioned either.  Also a tendency to muddle designations and use only late war - for example the anti-tank units were known as panzerabwehr einheiten early in the war, and did not become panzerjger until much later; this is not hinted at.  So those looking for proper designations will not find this book helpful. <br /> <br />What the book does do is cover in broad strokes the basics of how a German panzer soldier was inducted, trained, what basic tactics and crew positions he was taught, withsome brief history of units, vehicles, and campaigns. Uniforms are discussed in some detail, but not nearly enough  - for example the date of discontinuation of the pink collar piping is not mentioned in the captions for plate A.  A partial list of branches that wore the black uniform is provided, but this too is incomplete and covered in far more detail by Edwards in the FIELD UNIFORMS OF GERMAN ARMY PANZER FORCES IN WORLD WAR 2. <br /> <br />Which brings us to the disturbing trend in Osprey books.  Edwards seems to have been a source for the branch information (the book is not listed in the bibliography, incidentally).  Much more research than previous, speaking in general terms of Osprey books, not just this one in particular, seems to be done through secondary sources.  The panzer-propaganda units are mentioned prominently in Edwards' book, for example - the first mention in print I've seen of them.  Williamson has dutifully, it appears, made use of this secondary information to pass on in his own book.  Note also the anecodatal story of the SS man captured by Polish troops on page 55, which is the sole basis for an entire section devoted to the No Quarter treatment of tank crews.  Williamson has interviewed many veterans and so much of the \\"secondary\\" material here is no doubt confirmed by his interviews during his long career, but one wonders how much of each is present. <br /> <br />Fans of Barkmann and Wittmann, the panzer experts, will appreciate the extensive coverage of these two figures, with photos from Herr Barkmann's personal collection.  Unfortunately, no Army figures are given similar treatment. <br /> <br />Williamson does cover some good ground; for an introduction to tank crews - which is all the book claims to be - it will be money well spent.  Might have benefitted from a more consistent focus; more attention paid to getting the uniform information better presented (this is done much better in Osprey's own THE PANZER DIVISIONS), perhaps stayedaway from quite so many Waffen SS stories and anecdotes in favour of more primary research. <br /> <br />Overall good, and the colour plates add tremendously to this.  Williamson is a solid writer and writes in a colloquial, anecdotal style.  This should not be offputting to the majority of interested parties buying this book.	2004-09-04

Sometimes we even get to examine his thoughts.  But this book really isn't about Hitler in the way that other books have been about him.  It does not study in any detail his psyche or the attitudes of others to him in any kind of detail.  The book does hint at these things, but rather than providing any kind of detailed or complex look at Hitler, the man, it is instead a telling of the history of his domain from 1936-1945. <br /> <br />At that, it is a masterful telling.  Kershaw is an excellent historian, and there is much of substance in this volume, focussing on Hitler's decisions and their effect on the German people, their economy, and their war machine.  Hitler's relations with others are only briefly sketched out - important figures in his life like Eva Braun and Albert Speer are hardly mentioned, or only referred to in passing.   <br /> <br />This is not a biography, but a history, and readers are advised to take it for what it is.  It is riveting, informative, chilling and suspenseful, and above all, gives a masterful feel for what it was like to be living in the Third Reich at the time.  There is no revisionist tone and no feeling of hindsight - as the pages go by, Kershaw gives a real sense of what Germans as a whole were feeling, from euphoria in May 1940 to abject defeat in February 1943, to ambivalence to life itself in April 1945.  But it is really not a detailed look at Hitler personally.	2004-08-26

It is also disturbing and sometimes takes a strong force of will to get through the material. <br /> <br />The language is scholarly but easy to read, and the tone is matter of fact.  The book is very well focussed, and does much to prove the central thesis - that the German people as a whole were responsible for the Holocaust, and that the perpetrators were not villains or evil incarnate, but \\"ordinary Germans\\".  Does much to explain how such a monumental crime could have occurred - the simple math, for example, showing how many concentration camps in the country was eye opening on its own and makes one think about how broad and enormous these crimes against humanity were. <br /> <br />However, Goldhagen is obviously not impartial and evidence may be presented only when it fits his thesis.  Best read in conjunction with other works, though I don't know of one as masterful as this that would creditably present \\"the other side\\" of the story without being revisionist or sympathetic to the Nazis.	2004-08-26

The main characters on both sides are brilliantly fleshed out by the author, and the strategies and tactics on both sides give a good look of both the big picture and the actual events of the battle itself.<br /><br />Very nice additional chapter on the making of the movie is just icing on the cake.<br /><br />Hechler was actually in the US Army in 1945 and is a solid historian.  Only drawback may be lack of footnotes for the scholarly minded, but this book still gets a 5 for its coverage of the battle itself, and the aftermath - including German efforts to destroy the bridge, the postwar careers of some of the main players, the final collapse of the span itself, and the summary trials of the German defenders.<br /><br />All battles deserve the kind of coverage this little skirmish receives in this well written, suspenseful, and exciting book.  So well written you might think it is fiction.	2004-08-19

The former concentrates on divisional history and has only some general uniform details. The latter goes into greater detail but talks more about day to day life and equipment. <br />  <br /> This book, however, concentrates solely on the uniforms, and does so with beautiful colour photos of surviving garments. Captions are well done. <br />  <br /> However, this book does not reach the level of detail Pruett and Edwards have achieved. It also costs a fraction of Pruett and Edwards' book, and has better colour photos. <br />  <br /> As a basic general reference to uniform types, it would be my second choice if price wasn't a concern, and my first choice if it was.	2004-08-02

The book is usefully divided into chapters by branch of service (after introductory comments in general on the uniforms). The branch of service info is all footnoted with reference to German regulations, and discusses waffenfarben, shoulder strap devices, &quot;elite unit&quot; insignia where it deviated from the norm, dates of issue when insignia details changed, collar tabs, cuff titles, and other misc. insignia associated with each branch.      Jam packed with this information, the text is fully supported primarily by rare and unpublished wartime photographs.      A colour photo section is included; the photos are a bit murky and the section is not greatly organized, but is a nice addition.      There are also useful appendices and annexes giving a survey of numbered regiments of the various branches.      All major branches that wore the AFV uniform (both field grey and black, as well as denim summer variants, all of which are discussed and illustrated in this book) are covered, and even the Propaganda Companies, with several rare photos of the AFV uniforms in use by an Armoured Propaganda Company.      Most complete resource out there - be advised only Army formations are covered, no SS or Luftwaffe coverage - as the title very well states!	2004-08-02

This book offers a good deal of detail in many areas. As always, do not make this your sole source of information, but it is a great start on many subjects not covered anywhere else, not even the internet.      The book starts with an historical introduction to the politics of Eastern Europe, dividing Eastern European participation in WW II into 5 phases and providing some nice maps. It then looks at several different nations in turn - Finland, Hungary, Romania (mis-spelled &quot;Rumania&quot; throughout the text), Slovakia, and &quot;Other Allies&quot; - primarily Italy with a mention of the Spanish contingent. These &quot;other Allies&quot; have their own titles in MAA.      The overviews of the nations concentrated on politics and also have reasonably detailed orders of battle, including divisional compositions which also give an idea of how large their militaries were. The focus is on ground forces, with little said about air forces (and nothing about naval forces, for the simple reason that what little naval forces some of these combatants had played little or not part in the Eastern Front campaigns).      Nice touch was the inclusion of a chart with AFV national markings, and there are good detailed sidebars on the rank structure of the Finnish, Slovakian, Romanian and Hungarian armies with nicely done insignia sketches as well as info on branch/corps insignia.      Photos are good, and colour plates cover the four main nationalities well. Chappell is always good, and these seem to be some of his better figures; nice variety of poses and very clear details.      Comparing the info on Romanians in this volume to that presented in MAA 246, one can see that there are many details left out, but the basic essentials are all presented here. As a uniform enthusiast, I was pleased with the insignia information alone - this information isn't available anywhere else. Those looking for detail on equipment, armour, small arms, will need to look elsewhere.      Nice supplement to the other books in the MAA line dealing in more detail with some of these same subjects.	2004-07-31

There are many online resources now regarding German Army rank insignia for those so inclined.    What this book does is give a very broad overview of the scope of German insignia throughout the Reich - from train conductors to the various branches of the military, the Party, the ladies auxiliary services, and more - even the Legion Condor is included.    Given the broad approach to this enormously complex subject, only  a taste can be given.  I would have preferred that the subject matter be broken up into many volumes, but I'm not sure the market would have borne such an enterprise.    The colour plates are brilliant - rather than photos of fading, rotting artifacts, McGregor has very nicely rendered each piece of insignia by hand.  There is a scale bar on each page so one can judge the size of the insignia, all done to scale with each other, plus McGregor has found a technique to actually convey the texture of the embroidery in many cases.    Explanatory text is adequate, and there are period photos throughout the text that provide additional amplification, but not nearly enough.    Rated a 4 because of the technical quality of the coloured plates.  Should not be considered the only resource for anyone interested in particular branches.	2004-07-31

The contents of this volume is broken into specific parts; firstly an introductory history, dealing with the unification of Germany and their involvement in World War One, which is well written.  Next comes a numerical listing of German Army regiments, by type and nationality (Prussian, Saxon, etc.) but unfortunately not a detailed breakdown into higher level formations (which would have been hard to fit into a volume this small).  Next are some notes on organization of the army and some facts and figures on manpower, types of units, etc.  A piece on Conscription and Mobilization follows, with details of the German conscription system and training system, a sketch of the organization of German military districts, and finally a thumbnail glance at the various components of the German military - infantry, artillery (all the major types are described, with numbers of batteries given), assault detachments, cavalry, machine gun units, pioneers, air service, signals service, transport and communications service, medical and finally veterinary service.  These thumbnails give an approximate idea of their duties, roles and numerical strength and give a good picture of First World War logistics.  The photos in the text complement the information given, and are of a generally high standard. <br /> <br />Finally are the captions to the colour plates.  Embleton is one of the best artists in the Osprey stable; clear and interesting figures are rendered.  The final plate - featured on the cover - manages to convey without words the absolute horror and misery of life in the trenches through the effective placing of the dead men, the look of fatigue on the man who has just killed an Allied soldier with a now-blood-covered shovel, the look of urgency on the face of the NCO, and the tremendous explosion in the background.  Perhaps the finest depiction of First World War combat ever rendered - quite a lot to say about a simple colour plate in a history primer. <br /> <br />Sidebars include tables of piping colours for uniforms, though these are incomplete in some cases - reference is made to Guards uniforms wearing piping in the full dress colour but don't say what these colours are, and which regiments wore them. <br /> <br />A detailed list of regiments would have been a nice addition had there been room to include it.   There is a nice listing of ranks but no idea given of the corresponding responsibilities of men holding those ranks in the various types of unit - infantry company, artillery battery, cavalry squadron, etc.  Very little is said of German tanks and the air service information is properly the subject of a seperate book and a bit of a waste of space. <br /> <br />Also no guide to uniform rank insignia, which would have complemented the rank information, which has text descriptions of the insignia but no corresponding picture, and only for enlisted men and not officers. <br /> <br />Overall a good intro but would have benefitted from being about twice as long and containing more complete info on all the topics raised.  Another shortcoming is no detailed description of regiment, battalion, company, and platoon organization of the various arms.	2004-07-31

These are thumbnail histories only, but every battery and regiment is included, of all types including coastal, field, medium, anti-tank and anti-aircraft units.  Also special purpose units like the Survey Regiments, rocket batteries, counter-mortar units etc. are included. <br /> <br />Bonus material includes thumbnail sketches of the division, corps and army headquarters. <br /> <br />All thumbnails include the serial number assigned to the unit on mobilization, place of mobilization, dates of overseas service, and date of disbandment. <br /> <br />What isn't included is any info on personalities, commanders, statistics, types of equipment used.  Very bare bones histories. <br /> <br />Other bonus material includes brief survey of formation patches used in Canada and overseas, with primary references.  Nice addition.  Does not however cover regimental insignia. <br /> <br />A rare volume, but one that is worth picking up for both general interest regarding dates and serial numbers, and for anyone interested in specific battery and regimental information, a must.	2004-07-31

Standard MAA layout; pages of text with accompanying photos, and a set of 8 colour plates centrally located.  What is odd about this book is that the captions to the colour plates take up more than half the text.  This is an unusual variant on the layout of most MAA books.    The text is divided into sections - an Introduction, a piece on The Army and the State which gives a nice description of the organization of the military, Equipment, which focuses primarily on tanks but also on small arms, Unit Organisation which describes the different kinds of divisions and also has a nice sidebar indicating which regiments were formed into which divisions, Campaigns 1941-1945, with a brief history of the employment of the Romanian Army, with nicely done maps, and then the plates.      The plates focus mainly on details of equipment, uniforms and insignia, hence the absence of this discussion from the main text, however, the captions are so detailed they may be considered an extension of the text.  Plates cover the gamut from high command, to general staff officers, field officers, NCOs and men.    Disappointingly, the subject of rank insignia, or duties and responsibilities associated with the various ranks, is not addressed.  Another volume in the MAA titles does cover rank insignia in detail - MAA 131 Germany's Eastern Front Allies and I would recommend that title be read in conjunction with this one, for those interested in a fuller understanding of the rank system.    Otherwise, a fairly complete initial look at the Romanian Army is provided, and some details of rank can be deduced from context clues in the plate captions.    Plates themselves are well done by a Romanian artist, and seem almost identical to Volstad's style, not a bad thing.  Faces are a bit unevenly done, but details of uniform and insignia are clear, with borders well defined by black lines.  Good array of poses and mix of subjects.    Rated down for lack of rank insignia information.  Those not interested in that facet may rate this a 5 with regards to order of battle and historical info.	2004-07-31

However, Mr. Brown errs when he says the research is flawless. One example is the lack of mention of the actual rank title for &quot;der Spiess&quot; - in the Army, he was called &quot;Hauptfeldwebel&quot;, in the SS &quot;Stabsscharfhrer&quot; - but Windrow misidentifies this appointment title. <br />  <br /> Organization of info seems poor - waffenfarbe regulations were complex and could have been more easily detailed in a chart or table. <br />  <br /> Nonetheless basic information is quite good - but since MAA is replacing this title as well with a multi-part look at the divisions, this review may well be moot. <br />  <br /> Good table of ranks with nice drawings of the rank insignia - collar, shoulder AND special green/black camo rank badges. Nice touch. Nice divisional thumbnail sketches also including special insignia, commanders names, dates of employment, and fate. Nice mix of photos also, from soldiers in the field to &quot;celebrity&quot; commanders. <br />  <br /> Colour plates by Burn very nice also.	2004-07-31

The first few pages are dedicated to a detailed chronology of the rebellions, followed by a description of the Jacobite forces (with info on the cause itself, the makeup of Highland society, weapons in use at the time (with photos of museum artifacts to support this info), and a brief order of battle of one Jacobite force that took to the field in this period), a look at the Government forces (focussing on the political makeup of the United Kingdom at this time, the organization of the Army, armament in use, and a survey of Regiments that saw action at this time).  A final section on uniforms is well done, and augmented by the final section on captions to the colour plates.<br /><br />The book is obviously only a brief overview, but the colour plates go far in bringing the subject to life - much further than most other treatments of this subject that rely on contemporary art, or simply text, to describe the subject.  There is no deeper analysis of such things as rank structure of the British Army, feudal law, Highland recipes etc. just a nice concise history and glimpse at how the combatants dressed and were equipped.<br /><br />Great starting point, and Embleton's artwork alone is worth the price - very clear, almost photo realistic depictions of soldiers of both sides, in realistic yet not overpowering settings.  Probably the best faces of any of the many talented artists in Osprey's stable.  The difficulties of rendering tartan cloth have also been well overcome.<br /><br />Can't think of a single improvement to suggest for a book with the obviously limited intended scope of this one.	2004-07-31

No photos, and poorly executed hand drawn maps, do little to add to this book's desirability.  Written in plain language at about a junior-high level, not academic at all.  Probably a good book for a younger person just getting started in military history.  Does have the advantage of being footnoted and might make an okay basic reference for a college student, or even better, the starting point for further study using the books in the notes and bibliography.    Character sketches are adequate to the purpose.      Not a bad basic introduction to the life stories of these men.	2004-07-31

The claim is supported by evidence, though it may take several readings to fully grasp the intricacies of the argument being presented. <br /> <br />Focusses entirely on politics and thus will not satisfy those looking for the military details of this action, nor the planning issues.

Many details of insignia given, another example are the summaries of collar patches and piping, which describe the abbreviations worn on the patches and which districts they correspond to. <br />  <br /> Good look at history and organization, with special emphasis placed on uniforms.	2004-07-31

Very well written in scholarly style, the main subjects are combat leaders (as opposed to staff types like Jodl and Keitel) and those covered in the main text are (with a few surprising choices): <br /> <br />Sepp Dietrich <br />Karl Dnitz <br />Heinz Guderian <br />Albert Kesselring <br />Gnther von Kluge <br />Bruno Lrzer <br />Erich von Manstein <br />Hasso von Manteuffel <br />Walther Model <br />Erwin Rommel <br />Gerd von Rundstedt <br />Kurt Student <br />Hermann Balck <br />Johannes Blaskowitz <br />Fritz Bayerlein <br />Fedor von Bock <br />Ernst Busch <br />Ewald von Kleist <br />Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb <br />Wilhelm List <br />Ferdinand Schrner <br />Erwin von Witzleben <br /> <br />All have several paragraphs devoted to their careers.  However, several more personalities are covered as captions to the many good photos of other commanders, such as Eduard Dietl, Kramer, Schmidt, Hoth, or Paulus. <br /> <br />Author has a solid grip on the subject material. <br /> <br />Colour plates seem cartoony at first, but vibrant colours are not as jarring as in other books and actually seem to work well.  Faces are nicely rendered and do resemble the historical characters to a T.  Again, some personalities not covered in the text or photos are shown in the plates, with accompanying text in the captions - notably, for example, Fegelein. <br /> <br />A good mix of supreme commanders, high placed staff officers, and some notable army, corps and even divisional commanders.  Good coverage of the air force, little said about the Navy, but perhaps this reflects their roles in the war quite well. <br /> <br />Very nice volume and does a great job of illustrating, in words and pictures, many of the key personalities of the armed forces of the Third Reich.	2004-07-26

Williams was a staff officer in the Second World War (he just released, as of this writing in July 2004, his autobiography which is quite good also) and confesses to a certain fondness for his former regiment.  However, his apologies seem misplaced as he mentions them no more than other units in his footnotes and quotes.    The book is written in a very conversational way.  What is lacking is illustrations; there are many well done monochrome maps that illustrate the actions but leave the actual terrain to the imagination.  Photographs are mainly stock photos from the National Archives, printed on the same paper as the text and not high quality gloss.  Most are very familiar to anyone who has read much on the Canadian Army.    Also would have benefited from more research on the German side of things, but not necessarily a drawback.  Some good individual vignettes; his examples of the differences between Canadian and US units for example is a great element of the book and one of many nice little touches.    Appendices include notes on casualties - very eye opening - and a sample order of battle that goes into some detail of not just Canadian units, but British, Polish etc. units under command of First Canadian Army.    Very nice alternative to the official history by Stacey; slightly more readable than Stacey, about on a par as far as quality goes.  Just as good as Dancocks or any of the other, recent historians touching on the same level of history as the official writers Stacey and Nicholson did.  Not as detailed as Whitaker, but takes on a broader period of time.	2004-07-26

Chappell's artwork stands the test of time; only big gaffe is the mis-spelling of &quot;Winnipeg&quot; on the RWR shoulder title in the colour plates!! Also the use of the Boot, High Top would have been more appropriate for a &quot;D-Day&quot; figure. Otherwise, these plates are actually, in my opinion, superior to more recent work by Chappell and absolutely on a par with Volstad. <br />  <br /> Meat of the text is adequate; not much attention paid to post-1945 and very incomplete with regards to Unification and the new CF uniform - a complex subject in itself, just unravelling the Corporal/Master Corporal rank badges from the 1970 period will drive a serious researcher to drink! In fact, Post 1953 gets exactly one paragraph, and a closing sentence. If you are interested in post Korea, you won't find a single thing of use here - time for Osprey to put out a new title! <br />  <br /> But as far as a sketch history of the Canadian Army in South Africa, World War One and World War Two, not a bad start at all. World War Two buffs are pointed to the other MAA title CANADIAN FORCES IN WORLD WAR TWO for a much better treatment. There is probably no better World War One primer. Equipment buffs are better off with several other titles including Tangled Web by Summers and '37 Web by Ed Storey.  <br />  <br /> No real sidebar articles to speak of, no description of rank insignia or command structures, no description of organization. <br />  <br /> WW II uniform buffs are pointed to Bouchery, or my own books DRESSED TO KILL and CANUCK.	2004-07-26

Finding info on any one particular battalion will be hit or miss unfortunately, so if researching a favourite or pet unit, best to physically look at a copy of this book in advance of purchasing it.	2004-07-26

(Refers to review of volume 1)      The colour plates in this book seem a bit washed out, but that may be the nature of all these figures in khaki. That is the only real criticism of this volume.      What the book presents is a nice overview of the history of the British Army in Northwest Europe, both in 1939-40 and the French campaign, in the UK, and in Overlord and beyond on the continent. Additionally, a history of battle dress uniforms is sketched out and a brief survey of infantry equipment is given. Just enough for the average modeller to follow the directions on his 1:35 scale kit or 1/6 action figure, but beyond that obviously the reader will need to look elsewhere - such as Chappell's volume on British infantry equipment, or David Gordon's excellent books, or even Bouchery (though he does not specialize in equipment). Of course, the TOMMY and JUNGLE GREEN books would be a good bet for equipment also.      The sidebars are interesting; inclusion of 21 Army Group HQ is an interesting touch. Very nice detail sketch of the workings of the No. 4 Mk 1 (T) sniper rifle - one wishes these sketches were more prevalent in all the MAA titles.       Interesting tables on production figures, and a nice thumbnail sketch of the supporting corps and services and what they did.      Photos are, in the main, well above average and some look like they could have been taken yesterday the quality and clarity is so great. Others are not as good, but most are unique and not the &quot;stock&quot; photos that grace so many generic volumes on British soldiers.      Overall a good introduction to the subject, and reflects the current high state of the art of the MAA titles.      Comments above are for Volume 1; I see my review is crossposted to Volume 2. I also own Volume 2 and find it just as useful as Volume 1. Sidebar info includes diagram of battledress insignia placement, and good map of the Middle East. Sadly, still no chart of rank, responsibilities and appointments. This is sadly lacking in most British Army references - the differences between rank and appointment were very real, and a good source of info on the difference betwen a Squadron Quartermaster Sergeant, Quartermaster Senior Instructor, and Regimental Sergeant Major would be a nice touch.      Colour plates also seem a bit washed out, but poses are terrific and details are top notch.	2004-07-26

As with all MAA series titles, this has a comprehensive amount of information in an easy to read format; covers the Polish Army of 1939, and the various exile forces that came later as well as forces in Poland under German occupation.    Sidebars include Polish rank insignia in a nicely done monochrome chart, plus diagrams of Polish divisional insignia as worn by expatriate forces under Canadian and British command later in the war.  Also a nice diagram of Polish and German divisions in the fighting of 1939.    The photos from the early war period are dark and murky, no doubt a problem with the originals themselves and no reflection on the quality of the publisher - the late war photos are nicely reproduced.    Colour plates by Richard Hook are extremely well done, on a par with Chappell; perhaps a little grainier than Volstad, the poses and general layout are on a par with the latter.  Great variety in the facial expressions, too, nice touch.    Text deals with the history of Polish forces in general, and provides a list of sources.  Unlike coverage of other forces, little is said of uniforms, insignia, weapons, or organization outside of the colour plate captions.  Those interested in the more detailed historical treatment will enjoy this; those hoping for more detail on small unit organization, weaponry, etc. will be disappointed and need to look elsewhere.	2004-07-26

Whitaker may at first blush seem to be the most qualified to discuss it given that he was an actual participant, and the only officer of his brigade to return to the UK unwounded. Whitaker was a famous figure even in 1942, having played professional football for the Hamilton Tigers (and again in the UK in the Coffee Bowl) and earned distinction later on as the CO of the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry, and postwar as an historian, perhaps the best World War Two historian when it comes to overall campaigns. Whitaker was one of a very few historians to write about divisions and corps, and include the German side of the story, based on primary research. <br />  <br /> His book on Dieppe contains many nice touches - as all his books do - regarding the lives of the soldiers and officers, personal vignettes, and life-and-times kinds of details. However, he draws a lot of conclusions about Dieppe that don't seem to be supported by the historical record. Loring-Villa's book UNAUTHORIZED ACTION: MOUNTBATTEN AND THE DIEPPE RAID seems, to me, to be far more scholarly and presents the reader with much more dramatic evidence regarding why the Raid happened and what it achieved. <br />  <br /> Whitaker, on the other hand, comes off as an apologist with an obvious bias, and tries too hard to make the case that Dieppe was &quot;necessary&quot; for the Normandy landings to be a success - a conclusion that I disagree with. <br />  <br /> However, those with more of an open mind will like Whitaker's plain writing style, vivid descriptions of life for the soldiers, and his scholarly look at the decision making processes of the high commanders.	2004-07-26

Including the report of the CBC Ombudsman, as well as the rebuttal by Galafilm, the meat of this book is the detailed anaylysis by several distinguished Canadian historians. Even and balanced, written in a very scholarly way with extensive notes, this book is an effective tool in deconstructing the flawed TV series and understanding the basic objections raised by scholars and enthusiasts alike. An absolutely brilliant book. <br />  <br /> In order to truly understand the objections to the TV series, it is important to read detailed critiques such as this one. The series has high production values and in that way is deceptive. The Hong Kong episode, according to Ferris in this book, only has about a minute and a half of objectionable material in it. The other two episodes, however, are more complicated and objections to them not as apparent.  <br />  <br /> A very good starting point for those trying to get to grips with the controversy over this series, and the &quot;true&quot; story of the history being discussed by the series.	2004-07-26

This book on Churchill tanks is representative of many of the titles in the series. Many high quality photos, from a variety of sources, and above all, well written captions by a knowledgeable author in full control of the subject matter. <br />  <br /> This volume has captured German photos, both &quot;action&quot; shots at Dieppe and static photos of a captured Churchill, photos taken in preproduction and production line shots, action shots in difference locales (Africa, Italy and NW Europe) and postwar derivatives. <br />  <br /> The format of the series is almost entirely captions to photos, but the captions are always lengthy and draw attention to many arcane areas of detail, much to the benefit of the reader. Only possible drawback is the size of the book; this format and the high quality of the photos would have lent itself better to an 8 x 10 or larger format. I suppose this size is a standard in England; at any rate they fit perfectly on the shelf with the Men at Arms books. <br />  <br /> A must for anyone interested in the Churchill tank.	2004-07-26

Patton, Jr. <br />William Slim <br />Archibald Wavell <br />Georgi Zhukov <br /> <br />Many other commanders are featured in photo captions or the captions to the colour plates, from the Canadian Crerar to many expatriate Polish and French commanders, Vinegar Joe Stilwell, and other luminaries.  No commanders from the 1939-40 period seem to be included. <br /> <br />The historical portraits are concise yet rich in detail; colour plates are well done - resemblance to the historical characters is very good, and colours and bright and show off well the various campaign ribbons - a feat of research in itself! <br /> <br />A very nice overall look at some key players in the Allied armies; emphasis has been placed on British, Commonwealth and US land forces.  Some mention of naval commanders, very little on the air force.  Nice mix of supreme/theatre commanders, army group, army, and corps commanders.  Staff officers like Marshall, Montague, Brooke et al seem not to have been included in favour of combat commanders.	2004-07-26

It is an older title, and while it is well written and contains useful information, it is misnamed.  It appears to be a survey of US Army uniforms and personal field equipment - the text contains little else.  Weapons, organization, history are all absent.  The bare bones descriptions of uniforms fail to address the subject adequately, and the use of direct quotes from Army regulations seems to be more of a waste of space than a selling point. <br /> <br />Good photographs from contemporary sources, though these can probably be found in Stanton.  Current photos of artifacts photographed in harsh lighting and not terribly useful; especially photo of divisional and army shoulder patches which is murky. <br /> <br />Colour plates would be only reason to buy this book.  Collingwood has a gritty, softer style than Chappell, Volstad or Hook, but illustrates well the major uniform types.  Facial expressions don't seem to change much - all the figures look so grim! - but there is a bit of variety in the poses and facial features. <br /> <br />Much useful info on uniforms - the main purpose of the book - but this info is found in greater detail in many other volumes.  The author and illustrator can be forgiven as I am sure that when this book first came out, much of what was contained had not been published in the mainstream.	2004-07-26

In addition to being 25 years out of date, the photographs and plates seem not to tell the same story as the text, and many photos are poorly thought out. <br />  <br /> Equipment is photographed from an odd 3/4 angle in some cases. Other photos of dark green webbing show up as simply a blur. Other equipment is photographed against dark background. <br />  <br /> The period portrait of the piper in the desert is nice, but apart from the beard, Great Highland Bagpipe, and tattoos - all of which make a nice character study - an entire page is wasted on this photo which only shows a corner of the pistol case; presumably the entire focus of the photograph! The other full page period photo shows two infantrymen against a nice backdrop (a Roman aqueduct) but does little to illustrate the actual equipment. <br />  <br /> Other photos of the officers' set show the gear being worn incorrectly and incompletely; an odd choice since the text of the book discusses the &quot;official&quot; method of wear as set out by dress regulations. <br />  <br /> Colour plates by Chappell are good but only illustrate a fraction of the actual infantry accoutrements of this period and some of the illustrations are not discussed fully in the text or captions. <br />  <br /> Not a well thought out volume and in dire need of a reprint. In the meantime, try EQUIPMENT OF THE WW II TOMMY by David Gordon, TOMMY by the same author, or Bouchery's two volume set. Also the &quot;other&quot; TOMMY book.  <br />  <br /> Would love to see this very capable illustrator and author update this book with better photos, new information, and perhaps a better split into two or three volumes, with the last 25 years added in for good meaure.	2004-07-26

One of the premier artists for Battlefront games is a Spanish gentleman who does photo realistic artwork for the Combat Mission games.   <br /> <br />Bejeiro has done excellent work; colours seem a bit off but that may be a post-production process that makes the field grey shades a bit too blue. <br /> <br />Text is good; as noted in another review, subject matter is a bit scattered.  Another review also states there are better GD sources.  There are; the colour plate of the GD policeman shows the use of the Polizei helmet decal, which seems to be unsupported in other sources though I may be wrong. <br /> <br />Another interesting error is the deletion of Panzergrenadier Lehr Regiment 902 - a bit of a shock as I personally interviewed a member of that regiment, and it is certainly on the order of battle in other sources!  Probably a minor editing error. <br /> <br />Overall, the plates are great and some good photos of rare insignia.  Unit organizations are only very basic, and incomplete (in addition to the deletion of PzGren Lehr Rgt 902 mentioned above).   <br /> <br />Anyone really interested in any of the units in this book should probably find more in-depth discussions of them in other sources.	2004-07-26

Written in the second person, this book is unique, but it doesn't end there.  Blackburn has a rare ability to recall small details and the entire story rings with authenticity.  His stories run the gamut, as all good war memoirs do, from the sad to the hysterically funny.    Second Canadian Division seems to have produced few authors (unlike the First Division, with Mowat taking the lead) but those few that have put pen to paper have been incredibly good.  Whitaker and Williams were best when recounting the history of others, and this memoir stands out above any war memoir written by a Canadian in any single war.  All three books in the trilogy are a terrific source of information about the Canadian Army in the Second World War.	2004-07-25

This primer covers uniform insignia, basic organization of the Red Army, and a brief history of the Army as a social institution in the context of the Second World War.  Good sidebar illustrations on both the old and new rank systems, and some very good photographs.  Would love to see the Red Army get the same current MAA treatment - ie a multivolume set dealing with insignia and specialists in greater detail - but this volume stands the test of time.  Great artwork by Volstad, as always and in particular he has capture the ethnicity of the subjects very well, something Stephen Andrew has not been able to achieve in the newer titles.  Good lips and cheekbones on these Slavic looking characters!  A very nice introduction to a little written about subject in the English world.   <br /> <br />Would benefit in a future series by a look at decorations, the wound badges, and perhaps a finer breakdown of sample infantry battalions, armoured battalions etc. and finally perhaps a look at training and recruitment in the Red Army.	2004-07-25

I'll make a general comment on the increasing utility of the Osprey Men at Arms series in general. Not one of the \\"older\\" titles, but still fading into the distant past with a publication date of 1990, this does represent the rise in quality of MAA titles. Volstad's colour plates need not be discussed in detail; these are as good as his always are. Even in 1990 he was raising the bar he himself set with the earlier IN ACTION series of the 1970s.      The text is especially useful in exploring this little known facet of German military history. While the Hermann Goering Division is understandably famous, many historians fail to grasp just how many Luftwaffe ground formations really existed - or what a drain on the German military they represented.      Excellent and concise description of all the divisions, with well written discussion of how they were equipped, why they came to be, and who was responsible for keeping them in the order of battle. Unusual for MAA to concentrate on units that were below average for the most part, but this only speaks to the all-encompasing nature of the entire series as a whole.      A good addition to those interested in this specific area of research; the Feld Divisionen fought on the west, east and southern fronts so anyone wanting to materially add to their understanding of, say, the Eastern Front in particular, will not find this volume a must read.	2004-07-25

Some minor errors of fact are present, but readers must understand that the purpose of works like this is to get the community talking and discussing.  Many items that were commonplace in 1944 are a mystery to us today; thanks to the efforts of authors like Gordon, the mysteries are slowly being unravelled.  Good photography and clear descriptions overcome any weaknesses in research, which are minor.  Recommended to airborne collectors in particular, and priced right for the general interest reader as well. <br /> <br />Some notes on the book can be found at my site at [...] under BACKGROUND ON BOOKS	2004-07-25

I would like to add that Granatstein does a very nice job of categorizing the generals, and discussed Francophones seperately as well as the Militia officers seperate from the PFs.  Of course, in real life they were very much seperate.  The stories of all the generals are inter-related, and so there is a certain amount of crossover between the chapters - but never does this amount to repetition.  Granatstein and his editors did a terrific job of keeping the prose flowing and not becoming redundant from one chapter to the next.  One cannot praise this book too highly from that point of view. <br /> <br />Lack of explanation of duties of the various officers and levels of command leave this one at a 4 star rating.  Some detailed examples of command decisions would have been nice, but are probably not necessary in what is essentially a character study - and a fine one at that.	2004-07-25

I have not yet met Mr. Williams, however, though I have enjoyed his book THE LONG LEFT FLANK very much.  I have yet to read his histories of the Patricias or of Lord Byng of Vimy. <br /> <br />I have, however, read this volume with considerable interest.  In addition to the very rare photos of historical figures drawn in broad strokes by regimental historians such as Copp, Bercuson and Farran, this book really does paint those same figures in more human ways.  One wishes Williams went into more detail regarding the figures he didn't like, but I suppose only the hard core regimental historians would have had the foggiest of who he was talking about. <br /> <br />As it stands, the book is the perfect length and discusses his entire life in detail.  Those hoping for a rootin' shootin' story will be disappointed; the prewar days of the Great Depression are covered in equal time, and Williams served overseas in a very important role - away from the front lines. <br /> <br />Williams has the eye for detail that sets apart the great historians from the good ones, and is clever at spinning interesting tales.  If one had to find something to criticize, perhaps one or two of his tales don't have as much of a punch line as one would like, but overall this Highlander has done his old regiment, and himself, very proud. <br /> <br />Congratulations to Mr. Williams for an excellent book, one hopes not the last in a string of fine works by this distinguished Canadian.	2004-07-25

This book contains a wealth of data - from variants on the tank destruction badge (including post war variants and fakes) to the history of the award, to a listing, complete with photographs, of the men who had the most awards.  That would have been enough, but there are also sections on award documents, a discussion of the policy on leave for soldiers so awarded, and a brief discussion with photos of weapons used for anti-tank work by individuals (the requirement for earning the badge). <br /> <br />Very comprehensive look at this unique award, its history, its holders, and how it was earned.

Pruett and Edwards have done excellent work in the field of panzer uniforms, but their volumes are expensive and not everyone needs to invest in that kind of volume to get the very basics which this book provides. <br /> <br />Colour plates are very appealing.  Artwork is a bit murky - no hard dileneations such as in Volstad's paintings with deliberate black outlines, but poses are very good as is colour.  Some fine recreated portrait shots show a wide array of uniform types and details. <br /> <br />Writing is good and concentrates on many general subjects, going into appropriate levels of detail such as when the complex collar patch situation for anti-tank and self-propelled units are discussed. <br /> <br />Good sketch histories; another good source for panzer division histories may be PANZER COLORS II, but there is more detail in MAA 24 regarding historical employment.  Some fine photos complement the text and make this a good overall treatment which really doesn't show its age all that much.  Stands up just fine with other books on the subject.	2004-07-25
US	49244843	R38UQDF7QQDVVH	0812824687	213140720	The German Army, 1933-1945: Its Political and Military Failure	Books	5	14	15	N	N	Excellent	Amazon's new &quot;real name&quot; policy means that my older review is no longer associated with my profile - so I will reiterate my comments earlier plus a couple of new observations.      I have no idea why anyone would suggest that Cooper's book is flawed because it doesn't mention the Holocaust - it is simply not about that.      What this book does do is examine in detail the myth of Blitzkrieg and the inner workings of the command structures and way of waging war. Cooper lays out very clearly how the old myths were started, and describes very clinically how the German Army was a victim of its own traditions - both in its way of making war (modern &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; actually can be dated back to at least 1866, as Cooper points out) and in its subversion by Hitler - obedience to a man (emperor or Fuehrer) was the tradition by which the German Army ensured its own destruction.      Rivetting reading. I can't offer any deeper insight into the accuracy of some of the discussion - the earlier reviewers may have valid points about Enigma and the Russian Archives - but certainly this is the way to open one's mind to the idea that the German Army really wasn't all that revolutionary in its warmaking concepts.      Many of the conclusions do seem to be supported by statistical &quot;facts&quot; such as the continuing theme of shortage of supplies, basic equipments, etc. How much this information has changed since Cooper wrote the book is open to interpretation - but it seems unlikely that the Russian archives would shed much light on German logistical requirements.      I kept looking for Cooper to lay blame for the war on the Generals, or to absolve them completely - he does neither, as far as I can tell, though a book this dense needs to be read more than once for its full impact to make itself felt.	2004-07-25

Covers all basic items of kit very well, and gives dates of introduction, common colour shades, and extent of issue (ie to whom the items were issued and for what purposes). <br /> <br />Illustrations and colour plates top notch - clear and well laid out, rich with detail.  Photos very good also, many unpublished ones, and of a uniformly high quality.  Equipment and artifact photos a little poorly done, obviously taken outside in bright sunlight, making for harsh shadows and poor detail. <br /> <br />Overall, possibly the best basic guide out there, certainly for the money.  Next step up would be Lee's SOLDAT series, which is more of an investment and lacks the clarity of Volstad's colour plates, but goes into more detail from a collector's point of view regarding variants and how to tell fakes from real items.	2004-07-25

Still, so much information between two covers as to make this one an essential part of any library, with the obvious cautions attached as caveats. <br /> <br />Much reseach went into this, and many good period photos along with contemporary reconstructions.  Models look a little too French (because they are) but that is a minor quibble.  Worth the price and a great reference for formation organization, vehicle markings, and uniform insignia.  Used in conjunction with other sources specializing on matters of insignia (Brian L. Davis or MAA 187) and uniforms (TOMMY) you can't go wrong.	2004-07-25

I commend Jean Bouchery for his efforts in assembling this book. Much information has not seen print before, and many photos of rare kit are an invaluable resource.<br /><br />However, there are many errors of fact strewn through the book, indicating Bouchery's lack of direct experience with the Canadian military. The colour corrections to Canadian Battledress also render the book, in my opinion, not worth buying. Hopefully a corrected second edition is published - the publisher should really be raked over the coals for this, as the colour plates have been shifted drastically and are useless as even a general guide to Canadian uniform colours. Why print in colour if you are going to simply colour correct things outside the realm of normalcy?<br /><br />Just about every page has a small error, but many are due to translation I think. Recommended for the experienced collector or historian, those just starting out are advised to be wary.<br /><br />Still, much useful information if one can get past the presentation. I recommened buying this used or second-hand, until such time as a correction volume sees print.	2004-07-25

No frills; very brief notes on the number of awards, very brief descriptions of how they were won, but no examples of citations or specific details in what it took to be awarded some of them. <br /> <br />Conveniently divided into sections dealing with the seperate services, this will serve as a quick reference to unfamiliar decorations as well as provide the bare essentials on dates of introduction and conditions of award.  Some notes on presentation cases and awards documents also.	2004-07-25

What a waste, that the author should have died so tragically at so young an age. He left behind a legacy of excellent works, including this, possibly the finest, most intimate history of a Canadian First World War infantry battalion ever written.        The book tells of the glory (60 MMs in a single battle alone!!) in a most understated way, and talks of the bad episodes - the rum incident, the execution of a soldier of the battalion for cowardice - frankly.        The book may bog down slightly with its insistence on mentioning every award winner in the text of the book (with 60 MMs along at Hill 70, one can appreciate the need to simply list the names rather than discuss each and every citation in turn).        Nonetheless, given the amount of time that had elapsed from the end of the war to the publication of this book, it is amazing how solid a grasp Dancocks was able to get on the subject matter.        A thoroughly excellent summary and description of what it was like for Canadians in the Great War, and some thoroughly good character sketches. I especially liked the historical sidebars, set apart from the main text, and very convenient.        Excellent afterword also, describing the battle honours and the oak leaf badge of the postwar perpetuates. And a complete listing of all honours and awards bestowed the individual soldiers of the battalion.        Also an astonishing number of photographs directly pertinent to the text, amazing given the era of the subject matter.	2004-07-25

Official histories of any nation often get details wrong - such as the rather silly 24 tanks rather than 22 example given below. <br />  <br /> My purpose for buying this book was to get a basic handle on Italian military organization at the formation level, as well as an understanding of the rank system. In combination with some web research, I found this book fit the bill rather nicely, in addition to giving a good sketch history of Italian participation in World War Two (I am referring to volume 1 and volume 2 - I notice that some of the reviews for MAA series get cross posted between volumes). <br />  <br /> The sidebar articles are excellent and I really like the direction this series is taking with regards to the black and white artwork on the sidebars - nice and crisp, well laid out, Volume 1 has a table of blackshirt insignia, as well as standard Italian Army rank insignia, with designations IN ITALIAN and not those annoying British or American &quot;equivalents&quot; which really aren't. A great study of divisional employment and schedule of their coloured collar patches is well done as well. <br />  <br /> Volume 2 has insignia tables for colonial troops as a sidebar, as well as a divisional schedule as in Vol 1 but with specific information on the African theatre, plus a repeat of the rank insignia sidebar - but with shoulder straps for officers shown instead of sleeve badges as in the first volume. Excellent use of space! <br />  <br /> Can't speak for accuracy of research, but rank and order of battle info seem to jive with online sources. <br />  <br /> Marked down because of Stephen Andrew's artwork - colour and texture of uniforms very much improved over his earlier German plates (see German Army (1)) but faces and poses still lamentable.	2004-07-25

That is great, but somehow all the reviews I did in the past have become disassociated with my &quot;new&quot; persona, so I am going to repeat what I said under my old handle. <br />  <br /> In my earlier comments, I dismissed the book as possible fiction. I urge readers to make up their own minds, but also to look at the excellent historical articles at [...] for viewpoints by historians Lou Brown, Edward Kennedy, and Douglas Nash, for their thoughts on the matter. <br />  <br /> Not a bible for anyone interested in Grossdeutschland or the German Army, but no doubting it is a riveting read.	2004-07-25

Some of the black and white drawings are superfluous and taken directly from the IN ACTION series by the same publisher. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, some rare photos and a good overall flow as well as day by day history of the major events.  This could have been organized better also, but in toto this book is an invaluable resource for those interested in GD.	2004-07-25

Excellent, interesting and varied poses, great use of colour to simulate the different materials and textures, and historical accuracy make the plates a terrific complement. <br />  <br /> Comments here apply to volume (2) of the series. Very nice overview of unit organization, equipment, medals, a chart on ranks, shoulder patches, and more. Like the German series, these are very nice and useful sidebars and often cover information taken for granted in other, supposedly more comprehensive, works. Nice rare photos, and additional info on vehicles and &quot;elite&quot; unit in Italy make this a very well rounded volume of good overall interest.	2004-07-25

Case in point in this volume is a chart reflecting &quot;orders of dress.&quot;  <br />  <br /> Very good precis of basic uniforms, organization and history of the German Army in this period. Many photos are familiar to those who own Davis' book on Uniforms and Traditions, however, the text covers many things Davis does not, and Thomas has researched things to a much higher degree of understanding than Davis. It is great to see historical sources improve like this! <br />  <br /> Colour plates are good; my criticisms of Volume 3 still apply; I'll also add that the colours are not as subtle as they ought to be. Volstad's watercolour-looking approach is a much more subtle expression of the texture and colours of field grey woolen cloth than Andrew's neon green approach. Volstad also has more diverse and dynamic poses for his figures than Andrew attempts. <br />  <br /> Overall, though, Andrew shows a lot of variety of kit. Good overall work as far as general references go, and the table of specific information are a treat for those especially interested in the insignia side of things. For kit collectors, you will need to look at SOLDAT or some other references, as this will not show you how to wear specific things, for example. Not a drawback as that is not the aim of these books, just a warning so you aren't wasting your money buying something you are not looking for.	2004-07-25

His series does a lot of things no other series has yet done; provide detail rich current photos of actual equipment and how it was worn, with detailed information on variants, insights into the soldiers' lives, and some very good comments on telling original items from postwars or reproductions - a must for serious collectors. <br /> <br />These books are a great alternative to pricier, and out of print, works like Angolia's much more comprehensive books.  For the collector, Lee's books are probably even a little better as the photos are larger and clearer.	2004-07-25

The detailed info in this volume includes rank insignia of the Eastern Legions, info on Beamten (military officials) and a detailed table on Beamten - this stuff is not currently available in English in any other currenly printed books.       The meat and potatoes of the book are of course the colour plates , the detailed history of the Eastern Front, and the list of divisions and numbered units (the last being especially only marginally useful).      Doesn't get five stars because of the colour plates. The poses are good, the artwork in the main is useful and shows a wide variety of kit, but the faces tend to look similar and the noses in particular need work. Andrew is obviously influenced by Volstad but needs to learn to put variety into his facial structure in order to present a realistic appearance.      I see my review for Volume 3 is also listed under Volume 4, and 5 so I will add comments on these here -       Volume 4's special content includes insignia of the ROA (Russian Liberation Army) and special rank badges. Probably didn't need a whole page for the latter, but a bit of new information is posted in the chart also.      Otherwise, all previous comments on the series, including those on volume 3, above, apply.      Volume 5 has no special content in table or illustrations, but the text does discuss in some detail all the campaigns that took place on the &quot;western front&quot; and has note on the organization of infantry divisions as well as good general info on uniforms and insignia.	2004-07-25

This is not just a dry recitation of the facts surrounding the campaign in North Africa, this is a full blown Cornelius-Ryan-esque portrayal of the US Army's trials and travails, from TORCH to final victory.  Few authors tend to look beyond the stories of their own nationality; Atkinson has very masterfully worked in the British, French and German sides of the story as well.  Historical figures are treated as characters in a drama rather than as simple names to be recited; dozens of commanders - many only briefly touched on elsewhere in the historical record - are fleshed out and brought to life with vivid descriptions.<br />Atkinson has a command of the English language that most writers only dream of, and summons the correct words from a very rich vocabulary eminently suited to getting his points across.<br />This is a detailed, and yet very, very entertaining, treatment of a topic that has not seen a lot of study in recent years, or perhaps even at all, beyond the official histories and the biographies of the notables involved (such as Farago's book on Patton, which did mention in detail Patton's North African experiences).<br />Only shortcoming might be the lack of detailed footnotes, but I personally don't think this detracts at all from the presentation.  This is certainly not a textbook, though one might be forgiven for turning to it as a valuable reference in addition to being an excellent and engrossing read.<br />A page turner and in a class of its own.	2003-12-25

These parts of the book come across as forced.<br />Having said that, however, I have no doubt Morgan felt them necessary to put the overall story into context, and they do that well.  This makes the book perfect for youngsters or those with no understanding of the larger picture of WW II history, and thus provide this with a broader appeal.<br />But the meat of the story is Morgan himself.  This is not &quot;just&quot; a story of a WW II bomber pilot, this is a wonderfully told story of Bob Morgan, the man, and a blushingly honest discussion of his many demons - his relationship with his departed mother, his father and siblings, his girlfriends, fiancees and wives, his crew (many of whom were fast friends), his superiors, and a terrific look at how he grew up, trained for war, matured as a commander, lived as a returning veteran, and overcame the evils of a pampered upbringing, and learned the value of hard work.<br />The details about his tour with the 8th Bomber Command were especially interesting, and his revelations about the WW II documentary about his aircraft will answer many questions for ardent Memphis Belle fans who always wondered how much of the 1943 documentary was real (apparently, not much), and also records what Morgan thought of the 1990 film with Matthew Modine (apparently, not much).<br />His tour in B-29s is also well discussed.  This is very much a terrific human interest story which just happens to take place in flak-filled skies.  It's certainly more Twelve O'Clock High, with its introspection, than it is Monte Merrick's Memphis Belle, with its cartoon heroics.<br />Colonel Morgan is to be commended for his bravery in baring his soul to the rest of us, for trying to make sense of his life in a way that we can all learn, for admitting to the hurt he has caused others, and allowing us to relate to his own hurts.  He was a courageous man at 23 - he had to be - but now, of his own accord, I think he is even braver in his 80s for writing this thoroughly inspirational book.	2003-12-25
