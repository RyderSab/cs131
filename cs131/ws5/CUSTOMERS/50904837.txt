I can't understand why fans are bashing this book, too much sex and not enough crime for some people I guess, I thought it was definitely different from the other crime books of Anita Blake but it was fun just to have the \\"Sex\\", \\"relationship issues\\" and less crime for a change.  Can't wait for more!(no pun intended:))	2005-05-09

Why is it that is so hard to believe that there were bad Jews in history?!  Just like there is bad people in every religion, ethnicitiy, race in the world?  Believe or not there were Jews and Romans at that time!  And there were some who good and bad, (yes there were many Romans who were good).  The majority of the followers were JEWISH!  Jesus was a JEW, who went against the corrupt leaders of that time, just like many Catholics are against the child abuse of today by Catholic priests and Muslims against the corrupt Extremists Muslims of today.  So why is it so hard to understand that this is what happened, not only because it was written in the bible (which we forget was written by JEWISH MEN), it is and was a historical fact regarding Jesus'death.  Of course there was a Jewish mob, because the majority were Jews, there was also a mob of Romans, Gentiles, because it was of that time.  He died for EVERYONE and that means we are ALL to blame for his death.  He died and CHOSE to die for ALL OF US!  So stop twisting the meaning behind this book.  Which is a beautiful book, beautifully written.	2004-03-04

Though it's no &quot;queen of camelot&quot; or &quot;grail prince&quot; it's still a captivating story.  I just had problem with Essylte's whininess and selfishness but that is part of the qualities that holds Tristan's heart, unfortunately.  Talk about pure obsession to the point that one cannot breathe without other is really heartbreaking and terrifying.  Anyhow, I love Nancy's writing, you can see in front of you as you are witnessing it at the moment, you can smell the smells, you can feel the pain, touch.  She's amazing, I hope she keeps coming up with more stories, they don't necessarily have to be in the Arturian legends, anything will do!	2004-02-13

What I love of Medeiros is her humor and sarcasm slips in her books.  But she also has many touching moments that will have a tear creeping out of your tear duct!  This is a sequel to \\"a kiss to remember\\", though I thought \\"kiss\\" was more fun, this is just as good, with funny characters,some heartbreaking moments and very sexy scenes.  I could not put the book down until the very end.  I also loved the \\"Fairleigh\\" family saga continued, hysterical at times.

I was absolutely bored by this book, though the wording on some scenes are breathtaking but it just didn't keep my interest.  I barely got to the end of the book.  Too much going on in the story, maybe if he focused on one theme.  Only a few writers I know can do what Helprin tried to accomplished, one of them that comes to mind is G. Garcia-Marquez.  I did love that it was set in NYC where I can actually the scenes he described.  But too bad it's boring.	2003-07-21

I am big die hard fan but every book she writes I seemed to have less faith.  Why doesn't she get it that we don't care for the new characters (who gives a hoot of \\"Goblin and Quinn\\")that she constantly writes about(except Merrick, that was very good).  All we care for are the vampires we came to love since the first few books!  I want to hear about \\"Lestat\\" and his stories, \\"Louie's\\" adventures.  I'm also tired of Anne not using an editor for her books.  She has great ideas if only she would let someone edit her books as it was done in the past, then they would make more sense to read!  Without one she just rambles and rambles on and on!  Why let us read the Letter to \\"Lestat\\" in this story if \\"Quinn\\" will mention the same damn letter to \\"Lestat\\" AGAIN!  She just repeats the words over and over, till you're mad!  I really dreading her next book.  ANNE STOP THE MADNESS!!!	2003-07-16

Though this does not rate with &quot;here on earth&quot;, it's still very moving and beautiful and what a great metaphor to use, the women in the dysfunctional family are &quot;witches&quot;!  It parallels real life, aren't there times us in the general public, have felt that we were in a &quot;strange&quot; family unable to communicate to others our strange &quot;gifts&quot; to others.  Alice Hoffman does a great job again, it just flows and there are moments of surrealism that just paints a beautiful canvas in many scenes.  I hope she does more &quot;witch&quot; stories, she did a great job in &quot;practical magic&quot; and now this book!:)  She has a knack for &quot;witch&quot; stories!	2003-07-10

There needed to be more editing on many parts of the book.  The information is great but a lot of Prince die-hard fans(like me) already know his biography except for the later years.  As for the later years of Prince I wanted more info especially in his marriages.  I think the author was afraid to be labeled as a \\"tabloid\\" writer and didn't dwelve more into how his view of women and the lack of showing emotion hurt his 1st marriage.  And some typos in the book as his older half(or step) brother Alfred and then his name is incorrectly turned into \\"Albert\\".  Though there are fantastic reading moments in the book, also great research and marvelous insightful moments in Prince's life that many fans may have not known.  However, it's an average to mediocre completion.  It could had been done better and also I wish the pictures in the book were in color too!	2003-05-01

I was fine with the original story regarding the husband and his secret but the scene that is toward the end was just a little nausating because of who it involved.

No one really taking it seriously except Bergen who learned it too late.  Everyone else just accepts and moves on.  I couldn't understand why Silver motivation for anything especially his anger.  I understand their father's influence over the children and how their parent's violent relationship had traumatized them forever but beyond that.

I was totally mesmerized by the plot and of the main character &quot;Merrick&quot;.  Anne details carefully the voodoo and the underworld perfectly as if you are there with &quot;merrick&quot; and the narration has gotten better since &quot;Armand&quot; which the narration just dragged.  But this book will also leave you breathless, I was so exhausted reading a chapter that I had to take a breather for a moment because the adventure (especially in Guatemala) was a roller coaster ride.  It's just not one chapter it's many chapters especially toward the end.  Anne I want more of &quot;merrick&quot;, Mayfair witches and the vampires.

It really is a great read, though it could had been 200 pages shorter it still a fantastic story. But what I liked especially was the the special care Donati took to write the surroundings in the book with such realism  and being from New York it was even more fun to read a book based in New  York!  I also loved the way she wrote Nathaniel and Elizabeth as a couple,  as real as you can get in what happens between couples sometimes even  loving ones!  They argue, they fight and they do say things to each other  that every couple goes through in the real world, but overcome it.  I'm  tired of reading books that have couples so &quot;hoochie-koochie&quot;  with each other that it becomes unrealistic.  Their relationship was a  breath of fresh air and real!
