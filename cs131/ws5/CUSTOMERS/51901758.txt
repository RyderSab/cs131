I'm currently in training to be a yoga teacher, and this book is required reading for my courses.  It really goes into detail, as it applies to yoga postures and breathing.  It's a must-have for the serious yoga student or teacher.  It will help you make the most of your postures, and understand the mechanics involved.  It will also help you explain and cue poses if you are a yoga instructor.	2005-09-06

My daugther is 14 months old, and feels so relaxed during the mellow poses, and laughs during the \\"happy baby\\" poses.  You can tailor the session to meet your needs and the time of day.<br /><br />This book is well-written and organized by baby's age from birth to 24 months.  The author writes with a real love and respect for babies.<br /><br />Some of the poses are based on traditional yoga, and some are more like massage therapy.  Most of the poses have a cute little song to go with them to keep the interest and attention of the baby.	2005-07-14

Grilled Tuna with Washabi Whip was on the menu this week, as was Tofu Olive Wraps (sun-dried tomatoes, olive spread, watercress, fresh rosemary, carmalized onions).  Everytime I cook from this book, my hubby can't stop raving.<br /><br />I use this cookbook daily, not just for holidays.  However, it does have some great holiday ideas.

This is the book that I consult each time one of my three kids (or husband) gets sick.  It's organized by illness, and gives a list of symptoms and general description of the condition.

There are three levels to each of the ten steps, and she helps you gradually reach the point where you want to be.  It's not all-or-nothing, and she peppers it with humor and personal stories.  It is well-written and researched.   <br /> <br />It really is a great book, and if you follow just a few of the 10 steps you will see a huge difference in your body and health.

I've cooked at least 15 recipes from this cookbook, and they have all been great.  At least 5 of them have been very exceptional, way beyond my expectations for a crockpot recipe.  I have many crockpot cookbooks that have given mediocre results, but this one is by far the best giving me tremendous dishes to serve my family.<br /><br />There is a real variety of recipes in here, including many versions of chili.  My favorite recipe is the Moroccan Chicken and Vegetable Stew with Cous Cous.  Delicious!!  Tastes like what I paid $18 a plate for in a famous restaurant in Carmel, California.<br /><br />Some of the recipes do require you to brown ingredients before placing them in the cooker, but that takes minimal time, about 10-15 minutes.  From there, the cooker does the rest.<br /><br />This cookbook is perfect for the busy Mom, who wants gourmet home cooked meals with only a fraction of the work required for traditional methods.<br /><br />Worth every penny!	2004-11-25

Not only will you have your meals planned for the whole week, you will probably loose weight!  They are all very satisfying, healthy meals filled with veggies and healthy grains.<br /><br />The recipes are divided into each of the four seasons, with 8 weeks of recipes for each one.  Each week of recipes has only 6 meals planned, so you can have a night to either eat leftovers or eat out.  Each week typically has 2 chicken dishes, 1-2 vegetarian meals, a fish night, and a beef night.  At least one of those recipes will also utilize the crock pot. You will take advantage of what is fresh and in season.  I love that the summer recipes use the grill a lot, and never have you turning on the hot oven.  On the other side, the winter recipes have you using the oven for great meals and the crock pot for yummy stews.<br /><br />This book got me so organized, and stopped our family from eating fast food more than we should.  You'll love it!!	2004-09-25

It just has healthy, sensible recipes that are DELICIOUS!!  I've made many of the recipes, and they have been hits with my husband, which is saying a lot!  He loves his carbs!!<br />I will agree with other reviewers that this book does involve a lot of chopping.  But, that's to be expected when you are cooking with fresh ingredients and avoiding processed foods.  However, I have three kids, one of which is a 6 week old, and I've been able to cook the recipes.  It's worth the work, trust me!	2004-06-16

I like his overall message, but I think you get more info and a better nutritional diet with South Beach.  The recipes in the Hamptons are pretty good, but again, the South Beach cookbook is worlds better.<br />I think I'm sour on this book because the main difference between this book and others is his recommendation about Macadamia Nut Oil instead of Olive Oil .  He goes on and on about it, and even recommends a brand.  I bought it, and it's good, but he owns the company.  I just think it's in bad taste to act like you are being objective about a recommendation, and then you are really trying to sell your own product.  He should have been upfront about that.	2004-06-16

It also contains some classics, and recipes I thought I'd never find from cookies I enjoyed in my childhood.  Recipes for holidays, and throughout the year.<br />I love the children's section, and so do my kids.

It's kind of a mix between Atkins, Zone, and natural eating.  The thing that makes it different than Atkins is that she talks about how toxic certain foods and additives can be, such as artificial sweetners and caffeine. She also allows more fruits and veggies than Atkins, and advocates more of a balance in your meals with carbs, protein, and fat at every meal.  It's like the Zone in that regard.<br />I love her approach to exercise.  It's revolutionary.  She talks about cardio, weights, pilates, and yoga.  She suggests a very healthy exercise routine.<br />It's a very comprehensive book and way of life.  You won't be sorry you bought it.	2003-02-17

Otherwise, it has great recipes.  The salad dressing recipes alone are worth the price...<br />The reason this cookbook is so good, is because it has recipes that fit into her way of eating exactly.  No more trying to modify recipes you already have and don't know how to change.

I have a Masters degree in psychology, and have read over 80 books on parenting, children, and babies, and this is in my top three.  It gives such valuable insight into many parenting practices.

A way that will enable your child to develop into a wonderful human being, with healthy attachments and relationships.  How many of you wish you had a better relationship with your parents?

It's so sad to me that people would read this book and think it's a good way to interact with your baby, the most precious and vulnerable thing in the world.  Hopefully people have children to love them and be part of their family.  Having your child sleep through the night by eight weeks shouldn't be your primary objective.  Raising a healthy, well adjusted and happy baby should be your objective.  It just shows how out of whack our society is.  And people wonder why we have so many social problems.  It's because we value sleep and convienience over the well-being of our children.  We value time in front of the TV over time with our babies.  It is truly sad.  If you're looking for compassionate, yet balanced views on parenting and babies, look into some books by Dr. Sears.  Other good books are \\"Attachment Parenting\\" \\"Vital Touch\\" and \\"Our Babies Ourselves\\". That's where you will truly find the answer.	2002-02-17

This is a great book to help guide the pregnant exerciser in general, and especially if you are interested in pilates during pregnancy.  It has three workout programs, one for each trimester.  The book contains modifications for pregnant moms on the traditional movements, and even addresses the mom brand new to pilates.  There are pictures and descriptions for each move, and also a brief explanation of the benefits.  A bonus; the pictures for each exercise actually show a real pregnant woman, in different stages of pregnancy.  This helps to show placement of the belly in relation to the rest of the body.<br />I would have liked for it to cover some reformer exercises, but it only covers matwork.  In any case, it gives you good ideas for modifications that you could use with your machines too.<br />There is some repetition from her other book &quot;The Pilates Powerhouse&quot;, but if you don't already have that book, no problem.  Otherwise, there is enough new information to make this book work purchasing.  Especially since it's the only book I've seen devoted to pilates for the pregnant woman.	2001-11-08

I have several other books on pilates, and this one is my favorite.  It covers matwork, reformer, barrels, wall, cadillac, chair, and circle work.  Most other books only focus on one aspect, such as matwork.  People have complained that this book talks too much about pilates equipment, but the truth is, pilates is based on using many types of equipment, and this book discusses exercises for each apparatus.  Frankly, the book would be incomplete if it didn't discuss the equipment.  This book contains excellent pictures and descriptions for each exercise, along with telling you which part of the body you are working and the benefits.  If you want to have a full pilates experience (not just matwork), this book is the ticket!	2001-10-25

It covers anatomy, injuries, posture, and many other topics most pilates books don't even touch on.  It speaks to the importance of establishing an exercise routine, and provides the user with warm-up and preparation exercises to get you ready for starting a pilates practice.

I was expecting to love it, being that she's the &quot;trainer to the stars&quot;.  I found her book to be pretty basic, and she only covers matwork, which is only one component of pilates.  I would have liked for her to discuss the reformer, etc.<br />This would be a good book for someone just starting pilates, and only wanting to do matwork.  However, even at that, I found her pictures and descriptions of each move not to be the easiest to follow.  Other books have better directions for doing the moves correctly.	2001-10-25

I am currently really interested in yoga, and have been reading several  books on the subject.  I bought this one because I was pregnant last year,  and used the pre-natal video by the author.  I was not disappointed with  the video, and I found the book to be a great way to learn more about the  author, and most especially her style of &quot;Kundalini&quot; yoga.  Kundalini yoga focuses more on the breath, chanting, and mantras than your  traditional yogas. The book focuses on the 8 chakras (hence the title of  the book), and how you can work to &quot;unblock&quot; them and/or get them  to work to their fullest extent.  Sounds hokey, I know, but you get into  it, and she does have some good points.  There must be something to her  practice, because all the celebrities don't go to her for nothing!!!

I have many books on yoga, including Iyengar's &quot;Light on Yoga&quot;.  While I enjoy my other books, I have to say this one is my favorite.  It  explains the asanas (poses) in easy-to-understand language, yet it is very  precise and true to the essence of yoga.  I also like how the poses are  referred to in their traditional names as well as their western names (such  as downward dog, tree, etc.).  It makes it easier to look up poses in the  back, and integrate it with what you learn in class.  The back of the book  also has sample routines for beginner to advanced students.  An all around  great book!!!	2000-08-24
