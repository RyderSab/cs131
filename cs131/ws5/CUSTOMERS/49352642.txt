I bought this book because I liked the blurb on the back, and thought that it would make for interesting reading...needless to say, it's a move I absolutely do not regret. I haven't read any other book in the Darwath series, so perhaps that's the reason for my enthusiasm and fascination, but I've read Icefalcon's quest many times, and it's been enjoyable with every read.<br />The description of Icefalcon's emotions and understanding appear at first glance to be quite droll, but in understanding the tribal feuds and lifestyle, the reader starts to understand that the portrayal of Icefalcon is true to nature. It's not to say that he doesn't experience emotion or pain or fear, but rather that within his tribal upbringing, it is death to lay claim to such feelings. Only the strongest survive, and fear and cowardice have no place in the tribal structure.<br />The tribulations that Tir had to undergo, and his character's development as a result were very real and moving for me....The dark magic and evil was a potent stimulus in the book - and I was unwittingly caught up in the brutal descriptions of war and evil.<br />On the whole, I would definitely recommend Icefalcon's Quest... whether you buy it or borrow it, read this book and decide for yourself!	2002-05-31

I've read 'The Barbed Coil' at least thrice - and I've even been magnanimous enough to loan it to all and sundry (well, those interested in fantasy, in any case!!!). In summary, it's brilliant! JV Jones's writing style is evocative, clear and detailed. Very quickly you find yourself immersed in the lives and events of the characters, and of the world that they're living in.<br />I have to say that Tess adjusted supremely well to her displacement from Earth, though, but while her lack of angst and relocation anxiety might be a problem for some, it didn't actually bother me all that much.<br />Also, the fight scenes in the book have made me look at battle-scenes from a very different perspective... JV Jones has done her research very well, and the employment of strategy, battle tactics, and sheer descriptive clarity can make one almost smell the carnage.<br />The Illumination - well, I've learned more about parchment-making and pigment-mixing than might be employed in my day-to-day existence, but hey, if I ever need a change of career, I think I'd be able to do scripts quite well (provided that actually DRAWING anything is not a basic requirement!). Actually, even though I was so involved in all aspects of the book, the description of the requirements for the illuminations and the magic surrounding the use thereof gripped me the most.<br />I could not put 'The Barbed Coil' down, and spent an entire day reading it the first time, so I would heartily recommend it. Don't approach it with preconceived notions of fantasy and what defines it - read it with an open mind and an open heart, and you will seriously gain great pleasure from it!!	2002-02-08

George Martin absolutely blew me away with this novel. This has to be one of the best books I've ever read. The author weaves an intricate, dark plot, the result of which saw me reading the book from start to finish in one sitting. In fact, all I can do is wax lyrical about this book (which I subsequently crammed down all my friends' collective throats)!!<br />It's hard to analyse the elements that make 'A Game of Thrones' a winner... but here goes! George Martin's writing style is emotive, and immediately draws the reader deeply into the complex plot. The political intrigue is merely an echo of the chaos and upheaval that will soon affect the world, and one almost feels sucked into the inevitable vortex that starts spinning faster and faster. Any sci-fi / fantasy afficionado must read this novel...	2001-07-13

However, this book can (and does)stand alone, in that it can be read in isolation, but the reader still understands the plot.<br />Needless to say, I promptly got my hands on the others in the series. Lady Pain was well-written, with elements of humour, angst, action and excitement all thrown in for good measure... I especially enjoyed Vero's almost irreverent narrative style, and would highly recommend this book.	2001-07-13

Sarah is a woman who has seen the darker side of life, but she is determined to hold on to her property and ensure that her brother receives an education. Case is disillusioned with the world, and reluctant to love again after the Culpeppers destroyed his neice and nephew. <br />The two come together in a beautiful and well-written novel. Once Sarah realises that she loves Case, she gives him her all, while he (like all men!) is a bit slow on the uptake. Nevertheless, you're left with the definite feeling that these two will be together well into their twilight years.<br />I especially enjoyed the way Case slowly introduced Sarah to passion, carefully erasing her fears and teaching her the pleasure that can be experienced between two lovers. An abusive older husband made Sarah wary of sex, but Case heals her in the same gentle way that Sarah heals the wounded animals that she finds.<br />Sarah in turn teaches Case to love again, a realisation that hits him especially hard when he realises that he cannot live without her. In a harsh land where eking out a living is practically all-consuming, the fragile love that blossoms between these two is poignant and touching. Naturally, a keeper.	2000-12-29

Helen is...well, let's just say that &quot;prissy&quot; is an apt nickname for her. Helen initially irritated me tremendously, with her misunderstanding of Rafe, as well as her oft-issued &quot;Aaaaargh!&quot;. She also had a tendency to pull rank on Rafe, in a situation where her rank meant diddley-squat. In all honesty, she irritated Rafe as well, but he was still attracted to her.<br />Sandra Hill's trade-mark hot love scenes are present, and I would suggest keeping a pitcher of ice handy. This book was not as great as her others, but I would still recommend it highly. Reason being, that Sandra Hill spoils us with her excellent writing style, and her &quot;not-so-great&quot; is still fantastic.	2000-09-26

The love scenes in this book are steamy, and get added to my list of &quot;things I wanna try&quot;. (Just kidding!). Sandra Hill really knows how to hook a reader, and this book led to my rushing out and ordering more of her titles. The only thing that irritated me after a while was all the &quot;dumb-men&quot; jokes. I liked the interaction between Harriet and Etienne, and the secondary characters were fabulous. Cain and Abel deserve their own novels, and the witty repartee is excellent.<br />Harriet heals Etienne's war scars, and fights for the man she loves. She also heals the breach between Etienne and his daughter, and as a psychiatrist, she is well-equipped to do this. The plot is excellent, the dialogue flowing, and the humour excellent. A keeper, for sure.	2000-09-26

The plot was interesting, and the detail was extraordinary. I dare anyone to say that romance novels do not offer an education after reading the books in this series. Archer is a hard, strong  man, looking for love. Hannah is a wounded soul who doesn't trust the  ruthlessness she witnesses in him from time to time. I understood his anger  when she initially rejected his love, but I could also understand her fear  of getting into a relationship with a man who appeared to be so similar to  her late husband. <br />Once again, various governments come into the  equation, with the bitchy April Joy renewing her acquaintance with the  Donovan family. Add in the Chinese triads, and a host of people who are  trying to find the secrets of the Black Trinity, and you have an  action-packed, fast-paced love story. The passion is hot, the fear, pain,  anger and love are emotions that come across as very real. This book is  well worth adding to your collection.	2000-07-24
US	49352642	R13M8ZU7LN4FB	0380793334	123766976	Joining (Shefford Series)	Books	2	1	2	N	N	Another Disappointment	Unfortunately, it appears that the last few novels of JL's that I've read have been very far from her usual standards. Ms Lindsey takes us back to Reina and Ranulf's world, except that they (and their family) feature very  briefly in this novel. It is Guy de Thorpe's son who is the hero in this  book, and he has to marry Melisant. An incident when they were both young  has coloured their opinion of each other, so much so that they are both  unwilling to even entertain the thought.<br />And this is where the story  falls flat. Surely any reasonable person would consider that a meeting 12  years ago between two children would not colour their perceptions to such a  degree (Wulfric finds every excuse NOT to see Melisant ever since her  falcon tore a bit of skin off his knuckles). Their subjective  interpretation of the incident is a plot device contrived to keep them at  loggerheads, but it just becomes irritating, and removes any empathy that  the reader might feel for either of these characters.<br />The second problem  I had was in invloving King John in a plot to murder Melisant and keep her  from marrying Wulfric. This served no purpose except to result in Melisant  and Wulfric spending more time together under the guise of protection. The  King was used in several other ways as well, but the significance of these  incidents was not apparent. In fact, it seemed like a desperate attempt to  try to keep the original plot together, and then it fell apart at the seams  later on. Likewise, the attempted rape scene and kidnapping just seemed  thrown in for added effect, was very brief, and did not help the plot one  bit.<br />Melisant was extremely irritating. I like feisty heroines, and I  have no problem with them dressing like men, hunting, etc. But she was  dirty, she stank, was impolite and uncaring of her family's image. I could  find absolutely no reason for these two to love each other, and remained  unconvinced even after I had finished the book.<br />I know that JL can do  better, but her latest offerings give one the impression that she has no  time to write the gems that she is capable of.	2000-07-24
US	49352642	RDV0QAMQM9JWZ	0886778077	699742146	Spirit Fox (Daw Book Collectors)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A very interesting concept	I really liked the basic premise of the book, but, like many of the other reviewers, I felt that the entire story could have been better developed. I would have liked a better explanation into the beliefs of the region  (touching a member of the opposite sex was taboo, unless you were married,  etc). I didn't get a great understanding of the six magical elements, nor  was there an adequate explanation of the priests and their rise to power,  etc. Gaer's banishment is thrown in, and only explained later on. <br />I  thought that Adan, Bevin and Maddock were the best characters, and I liked  Brother Honesty's open-minded approach to learning something new. Maddock's  lack of curiosity about the &quot;Abomination&quot; was a disappointment,  as was Tassi's very basic and distant bad influence. Kiandra's confusion  about her changes are believable and she eventually starts to develop a  more interesting character later in the book.<br />If this book had been  developed into a trilogy, then perhaps many of the above issues would have  been addressed to my satisfaction.	2000-07-24
US	49352642	R11MU0LD7F3AWF	0671001701	938371139	Legend	Books	5	8	10	N	N	Arabian Nights	The first thing that I liked about this novel was the imperfect heroine. She was beautful, yes, but she had a weight problem!Yay!  Then of course, add the quintessential hero (tall, dark, handsome and RICH), and it makes  for some interesting reading. Time travel is not a plausible concept in  most romance novels, so I don't normally expect Physics 101. <br />Cole was  great, but right from the start we know that Kady has had lifelong dreams  about a tall, dark, veiled man being the love of her life, so I definitely  did not expect Cole to be her romantic interest (he was blonde). This story  was not so much a romance, as it was a journey of self-discovery for Kady.  She became more assertive and recognised her worth after her time travel  jaunt. She was a door-mat previously, always willing to help everyone at  her expense, but she starts working on that when she returns. <br />In light  of her caring feelings for Cole, it is no wonder that she wants to return  to his past to rectify the circumstances in his youth, and her attitude to  the money was, in my view, honourable. The romance between Tarik and Kady  is not so much a love story as it is a recognition of their love.  &quot;Legend&quot; itself provides the colourful backdrop for Kady's  journeys, and one can't help but love the residents in Cole's  version.<br />Buy this book. It will leave you with a warm feeling, and a  silly smile on your face.	2000-07-21
US	49352642	R2VV10XVT1OPPF	0451406982	706700696	Halfway Home	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Really nice	This starts off like a &quot;cinderella&quot; tale - wicked step-mother, evil step-brother, with Sara working herself to the bone to keep them fed. She inherits a sum of money, and decides to make a new start. She offers  marriage to a peddler by way of a telegram, and offers to meet him at a  Halfway House. While waiting for her groom, she meets Jericho, and that's  where the story changes. I have to say that Sara is imminently practical,  sensible and extremely, extremely naive. Jericho is gruff, tough and has  trouble expressing himself in terms of flowery compliments. I thoroughly  enjoyed the character's interaction, although I had a problem with the  villain. He served no real purpose, except in providing a link between the  characters, and a reason for Jericho to be at the Halfway House. The  necessity of the villain's appearance at the end also seemed unnecessary,  and he could quite easily have died earlier in the book. However, this was  still an enjoyable read, with good humour broadly interspersed throughout  the book.	2000-07-21

I think I've read &quot;Dark Wager&quot; about 4 times since I bought it, and I never fail to be moved by the story. Lucien is a hard, bitter, cruel man, whose distrust of Clara is all out of proportion to her actions, but  understandable in light of his past experiences. Clara was a bit too  accomodating, but showed her mettle later in the book. Considering Lucien's  character, Clara's willingness to compromise allowed him to reassess his  previous assumptions of her and open himself up to her love, trust and  loyalty. In an interesting twist, he later finds himself having to convince  her of the depth of his feelings when an earlier wrongdoing comes back to  haunt them. I enjoyed seeing Lucien's character change along with his  realisation of his love for Clara, and the fact that he tries to protect  her from his past ugliness endeared him to me. And yes, there were times  when I felt really deeply for Clara (you know, the twist in your stomach,  the lump in your throat, the burning eyes...), so I can definitely,  enequivocally recommend this book.	2000-07-17

One can't help but admire MC for putting himself through medical school by writing mass market paperbacks. The development of his brilliant writing  style is evident in this book, and the characters and events are eerily  realistic. Unfortunately, I couldn't handle the acronyms (with the  accompanying footnotes)!  Personally, I would have preferred the complete  terminologies, because everytime I stumbled across an acronym (and then had  to read the footnote), it broke my concentration. This marred my enjoyment  of the book considerably. However, it is still worth buying.	2000-07-17

The only problem I had was in Hunter's attitude towards Elyssa. He constantly made disparaging assumptions about her character, and I found it difficult to accept his eventual love for her. He  disliked the way she dressed, the way she moved, in fact EVERYTHING about  her!  Elyssa, knowing that her old dresses did not cover her up very well,  and knowing that it contributed to unwelcome advances from one of her  hands, continued to wear them, even though she was unconfortable in those  clothes. I liked her character - she was strong and determined. Although  Hunter's past does redeem him to a certain extent, it still couldn't  justify all of his actions. Winter Fire is a much better read - definitely  5 stars, and worth buying. I'd recommend reading this book, if only to get  more insight into Case Maxwell's character.	2000-07-14

When a book  leaves you wondering &quot;Gosh, wouldn't it be wonderful if it were  possible?&quot;, then it has made a definite impact. I have not read any of  the other novels in the series as yet, but this book stood alone, with no  puzzling gaps to fill. I had a problem with Mona and Michael (call me a  prude, but I do believe that 13 is a bit young! ). Other than that, the  novel was great.	2000-07-14

That alone makes it somewhat unique. The other is the storyline. Derek Craven is a product of his society, but has risen above his ciscumstances and become  fabulously wealthy. He is ruthless, hard, disillusioned and cynical. Along  comes Sara - curious, intelligent and an eternal optimist. She is not blind  to Derek's faults, but falls in love with him and proves to be his  redemption. Derek recognises what he needs from Sara as well, and although  he tries to resist it at first, he eventually realises what she means to  him.<br />Derek is by no means a rake who can easily be transformed by true  love. He is a man who has abased himself tremendously in his relentless  pursuit to leave the gutter behind, and he views himself as unworthy of  Sara's love. Her strong, patient character is the perfect foil, and the  conclusion leaves you knowing that this love will last. A beautiful book.	2000-07-14

Lara was a young, blushing bride whose  dreams of a happy union were totally crushed when she realised just how  little she meant to her husband. His disappearance results in her  discovering her sense of self-worth. Naturally, she is shocked at his  return, and bewildered by the very different person he has become. He does  not simply claim his husbandly rights, as he wants to prove to her that he  is a better man with more appreciation for her than he exhibited  previously. Lara's hesitance and fear of the marriage bed is understandable  - would you be eager to taste the delights of sex when in the past it has  been painful and humiliating? I think not. Hunter's character is fantastic,  and he really seems to need something from Lara - this need translates into  a deep, abiding love. <br />I think that the character's actions were in  keeping with their personalities. Never did I feel that Ms Kleypas was  reaching - there is even a justification as to how &quot;Hunter&quot; knew  so much about the original. This was a tender, moving novel, and the  passionate suspense was very well done.	2000-07-14

What a book!  I thoroughly enjoyed the Illearth War. Stephen Donaldson's protagonist is human, fallible, tormented, cynical and disbelieving of the magic that  carried him from his miserable leprosy-ridden 20th century existence, to a  world where he is hailed as a saviour. He finds it difficult to believe  that this world needs him, that the people rely on him to save them. <br />At  times, you want to kick Thomas into action, but the cause of his 'unbelief'  is extremely plausible. I did question some of his actions, but there is a  tangible element of harsh reality in this saga, and in the long run, his  actions have a direct consequence on the story-line. I heartily recommend  the book.	2000-07-14

However, the personality traits and characteristics that work so well in her historical novels DO NOT work in a contemporary novel. Women have changed in the last  century, and we definitely have more gumption, independence, assertiveness  and self-reliance. Tragic occurrences do not weigh the average woman down -  instead we are able to rise above it, and emerge stronger than ever. Reba  and Chance do not come across as 20th century people. She is clinging,  weak, teary and totally willing to submit to Chance's overbearing,  arrogant, chauvinistic, &quot;I'll take care of everything&quot; attitude.  Give this one a miss, and stick to her later novels. They're much, much  better.	2000-07-14

I first read it when I was twelve, and I snuggled under my bed covers with a torch 'til 13h00 pm in order to finish it. And then I couldn't sleep!  So  whenever I read &quot;Whispers&quot;, I get a creepy chill down my spine.  Which might be considered weird bearing in mibd the logical conclusions at  the end of the book.<br />I have an intense phobia of cockroaches, and that  scene in the book was probably what led to my intense feelings of horror  and fear. Roaches aside, this is still a brilliant book, and years later, I  still enjoy opening it's now tattered cover, and immersing myself in this  novel.	2000-07-14

Nevertheless, it doesn't detract from the emotional rollercoaster ride that  takes the reader from despair and danger to stomach-clenching passion and  love. Ms Lowell tends to use these ingredients in all her novels, with  great success. It does get irritating, however, in that it always takes a  catastrophe of sorts for the hero to realise his love, while the women are  prepared to live empty, bleak existences without their true loves. Not one  of the heroines show enough gumption to fight for their loves, but  magnanimously sacrifice their happiness for what they see as 'shackling'  the heroes from their dreams. I have to say, though, that EL's historicals  always find their way to my keeper shelves.	2000-07-14

The so-called scientific facts re Darwinism that we are regularly bombarded with are  revealed as mere theories, that lack even adequate scientific proof. Yet we  have been accepting these theories as gospel for decades!  One has to  wonder at the ethical mores of the scientists that are aware of the  shortfalls of this theory, yet continue to propogate it.

When reading the Qur'an, however, I came across several  admonitions re certain actions that he took, as well as a verse reminding  us that he was a man, albeit a great one!  This naturally forced me to  re-evaluate what I had learnt about him, thus it was with great interest  that I picked up Karen Armstrong's book. I found the novel to be unbiased,  insightful, and more educating than the stories learnt at vernacular  school. (I haven't yet read Martin Ling's biography). It was also  interesting to learn about the attitude of the West towards Muhammad.  Bearing in mind that KA had lost her faith, she nevertheless portrays  Muhammad fairly. However, if you are reluctant to read anything that  ascribes human motives towards any of his actions, then this book is not  for you.	2000-07-13

Maurice Bucaille challenges the reader to look beyond the initial, obvious translations of scriptures,  and to try to see the deeper truths contained therein. If you believe in  God, then this book reinforces that belief. Unfortunately, the Bible has  been tampered with by man, and God's words have been changed - but the  Qur'an has remained unchanged since revelation. This book also challenges  the accuracy of certain translations of the Qur'an, forcing Muslims to  re-evaluate their total, unquestioning belief in these translations without  ever considering that it might be fallible. All round a well-balanced,  interesting book.	2000-07-13

I found the book tedious to wade through, and I am sure that there are much better books out there dealing with the same subject matter. Ahadith, etc are  dealt with herein, but I found certain statements pertaining to the  collection of the Qur'an contradictory to what he had written about a  paragraph or two previously. Also, one of the Chapters refers to the  Sciences of the Qur'an, but do not be deceived!  It pertains to the  sciences of HOW to study the Qur'an. Mr Von Denffer also expresses a view  that &quot;Science and scientific truths, therefore, cannot be generally  accepted as criteria for the ...non-human origin of the Qur'an, ...&quot;.  I think that to ignore the science of creation and the laws governing  physics, atrology, astronomy, biology, etc that are contained within the  verses of the Qur'an reveals a very shortsighted approach towards studying  the Qur'an. All in all, a disappointing study.	2000-07-07

Aunt Louise, with her platoon of stray youngsters, is a feisty, determined character. Ella is a  strong-minded, independant, determined young woman. I had a problem with  Harrigan's lack of trust, but this is clarified quite neatly later on. The  love scenes are steamy, poignant and tender. I would definitely buy another  of Hannah Howell's novels.	2000-07-06

This novel was very enjoyable - the characters were well drawn, and some were not at all what I expected. It was primarily the originality of one of the female leads that makes this novel so very different!  (I don't want to  spoil it for you). If you like your female characters strong and  independant, then you will definitely like this book. I have to say that I  was strongly drawn into the stories of a few of the characters, but I did  at times feel very irritated with the male leads (although that could have  been the author's intention). All in all, I found it well worth the price -  it's one of my keepers (the cover's great too! )	2000-07-04

I especially enjoyed the gentle humour, and slow, steamy build-up of passion. The characters don't vaccilate, either. Their love is declared and  acknowledged, but other developments strive to keep them apart. Eduardo is  a dedicated lover, never wavering in the depth of his love. Tyrone is a  wicked character, but I later found myself wishing for a novel of his own -  I'd love to see how this nasty, wounded character finds the woman of his  dreams (and I'd love to see her give him a rough time of it, too!) Buy this  book!	2000-07-04

I had read A. Yusuf Ali, Pickthall, etc, but this translation was by far the easiest to read and  understand. In comparing his translation with Asad's, as well as Maurice  Beaucaille's 'The Bible, The Qur'an and Science', I found a parity within  their translations that made sense to me, personally. This translation does  not satisfy 'mystics', in that it clearly explains certain 'miracles' and  'inexplicable phenomena' with rational and logical meanings attached to the  Arabic verses.  This translation is well worth the price!  I bought five,  and distributed them among my family members.	2000-06-22

The Malory clan have been delightful companions, but constant references to beloved characters of previous novels have made the last two offerings tedious at  best. The passion and battle of wits that made me a fan in the first place  were decidedly lacking. The novel started well enough, but I very quickly  lost interest. Hopefully JL will be able to rekindle my interest with a  steamy novel about Jeremy to conclude the Malory saga.	2000-06-22
