The struggle to survive has never been more acutely portrayed than in this remarkable and yet true story of a daughter spurned by a famous but cold hearted father.  You will laugh and cry with and about Charlotte but you cannot come away from this book without a deep appreciation for just how easy our lives are today.	2005-05-10

No book is perfect and the use of colloquialisms running through this can get on your nerves.  The book's first 50 or so pages put forth a recap of what has happened in the recent past and that portion drags things down a bit.  However, once the Colonel takes aim at the mess caused by bureaucrats in every corner of our overstuffed government, he hits bullseye after bullseye.  His politics surface from time to time and it's clear he isn't a leftish liberal but his assessments of the pieces of the puzzle that failed us all on 9-11 are honest.  His suggestions of how we might improve things rapidly ought to be taken very seriously.     My advice to all is:  when you finish reading your copy, MAIL IT ON TO THE PRESIDENT.  He is the one who should read it and clean house!	2005-04-23

As someone who is accused of \\"reading too much,\\" I have read piles of books on this and related subjects.  But this one stands out not because of any original thesis or fact finding:  almost all of this information is buried somewhere on the internet.  However, the author has put together a madman's game plan and it rings too loudly of possibility.  The one thing Williams does not cover is just how big a member of the Flat Earth Society Osama Bin Laden might be.  To inflict this amount of damage on the world would have consequences.  Our atomosphere is a planetary one and therefore what starts here will float there.  But unfortunately given the as yet unproven tenets of Islam and its great belief in heaven, I suspect it wouldn't matter to Osama if he destroyed everything.  The only smaller threat that he might be encouraged to look at is that he should be confident that the US and other nations would most likely retaliate by the guaranteed wiping of that Holy Real Estate off the map:  there will be no Mecca for him to lead his followers to - in the presence of Jesus, no less -- because it, too, will be a mushroom clouded wasteland hit by the very western technology he lusts after.	2004-08-30

It's a start and a very good start on helping us understand what happened and what our government must be made to do if we are to survive as a nation. The taxpayers are paying zillions of dollars for overlapping fiefdoms that seem to be able to accomplish next to nothing. It's time to streamline and develop a serious work plan for folks involved in terrorism. It should not, IMO, include the government's favorite -- drugs -- unless it can be shown that an actual Isamofascist terrorist is in the business. It's amazing to see just how many agencies are tasked with the same thing and yet produce no product of value.<br /><br /> A very serious defect is that no Index is provided at the end of the book and for the book which after all will turn into a source document to be properly used, a good Index is necessary.<br /><br /> I also think it is time to name names and a great deal of that is avoided by the writers. Instead of John Doe, we hear about &quot;the agent.&quot; I would love to see someone write a followup book on just what has happened to the careers of the many civil servants involved in the 9-11 mess. Why do I suspect the young FBI woman from Minneapolis hasn't been given a promotion while the many civil &quot;servants&quot; who failed us merrily go ahead with their careers?<br /><br /> It is a relatively fast read and I don't think that people who don't read it should be allowed to vote! It truly is mind boggling. And we should all thank W. W. Norton for producing the book at a reasonable cost -- something the Government Printing Office is completely unable to do.	2004-07-27

I would rather see them permanently jailed or medically helped.<br />The therapist who authored this book only lets the pedophile himself discuss Depo Provera and Lupron.

That's the extent of the discussion about a possible solution.  I would have liked much more information on this approach because if the guy is right, we ought to have these felons check in at their local police stations several times a day to receive and consume their doses of either drug in front of a cop.  Should a person fall off that medical wagon, he or she ought to be permitted to choose total, physical castration over a long and apparently not very worthwhile prison sentence.<br />I realize it is politically incorrect to talk about right and wrong these days -- everything is relative and almost justified.  I remember three instances as a child where I was approached to cross this line and I immediately pulled myself out of these situations.  By the age of six I clearly knew right from wrong and it certainly wasn't because I had \\"modern\\" parents who talked about anything and everything with their children.  That is the concept being promoted here.<br />If we could get back to instilling a sense of right and wrong in our children, so much of this could be avoided.  When I was growing up the idea was to go straight to a cop or a teacher or any adult in authority if something wrong was going on.  Now I realize that teachers and boy scout leaders nevermind priests are often the culprits.  Here, too, we somehow knew who the good guys were that we could turn to for protection.  And had it ever been discovered that a person in authority did nothing to stop the abuse, that person would have been instantly fired.  The penalty placed on adult supervisors was severe enough that those  adults knew there would be consequences for their not doing their jobs properly.<br />So this book is interesting in that you learn that control of others seems to be the motivation for much pedophilia.  Sex per se isn't the root cause.  But truly the picture you are left with here is grim because no in depth portrayal of solutions is presented.<br />Without medical intervention apparently, the pedophilia will not stop if we allow these people back into society. That to me is the critical but almost untouched issue in this book.	2003-05-23

When you finish this book you have to ask yourself why many, many of our government employees have not been fired.The FBI would be better staffed by former NYC cops.

She takes the story of a child murdering a child and delicately peels away the layers of neglect that brought a young girl so far.   We in the US have seen way too many  young killers splash across the news.  Here is at long last a book that  shows us how these erruptons occur.This really ought to be a must read for  any person involved in juvinile justice, education, theraphy, and any other  discipline that places adults near troubled children.  All of us can learn  something here that will make us better family members, friends and  relatives of children in crisis.	1999-04-06

The author's voice is homophobic all the way through and her lack of understanding of where this all fits in the gay community is seriously deficient.Furthermore, Mis. Orth who always wants us  to know that she is the wife of Tim Russert, fails to dig up the truth of  the Miglin portion of the story.  She says she was stonewalled in effect by  police and policticans in Chicago.  However, she apparently didn't know how  to find out from other sources what Mr. Miglin's sexual preference was.  In  this story it matters.The second half of the book does have pace and shows  that with less of a Vanity Affair approach to life and writing, Ms. Orth  could do good work.	1999-03-15

This has always been my favorite, basic cookbook of American food.  It has been turned into a hodge podge of Foods of All Nations.  I don't know where I could shop to find the goat meat or thai spices that are often called for.  Hold on tightly to your old Joys or order a new copy of the older edtion now -- before they stop publishing it.	1997-11-16
