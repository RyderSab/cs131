This isn't a big book - only 206 pages in the hardcover edition - but that doesn't matter at all.  This is one of those stories that just grabs you from the start and sucks you right into the mythological world that Charles de Lint creates so well. It's not an action-packed book, nothing like that.  Instead it follows the interactions of about seven individuals over the course of a few days.  He makes the interactions between the \\"real\\" people and the people of myth totally believable.  I never find myself saying, \\"Oh, how can that be?\\".  Nope, I just go along happily for the ride.<br /><br />After reading this book, I want to go and actually see the deserts of the Southwest.  I want to learn more about the mythology of the region.  That is one of the secrets to de Lint's writing, I think - it's very easy to visualize the settings, to become intrigued by the mysteries surrounding the characters.  To want more.<br /><br />I enjoyed the nod he gave to Terri Windling, and I would second the recommendation another reviewer gave about Windling's \\"The Wood Wife\\" - it's another excellent book.  For those of you who may have read de Lint's \\"Forests of the Heart\\", there's a brief appearance of Bettina and one of her uncles in this book, which was a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />Read this book.	2005-09-03
US	52593236	RL5TAPYEEXSV9	0441011071	937274355	The Maquisarde	Books	4	1	3	N	N	An Interesting Premise	I enjoyed this book.  The transformation of Ebriel from a rather self-centered musician to a revolutionary was interesting, as were the out-of-the ordinary locales uses in the book.  It was an interesting change-of-pace story.<br /><br />I did have a few quibbles with it, though.  Given the fact that the Line of Demarcation was an artificial construct, drawn after nuclear and biochemical warfare, it just seemed a little strange to me that drift didn't seem to be taken into consideration.  There also didn't really seem to be anything wrong with the people on the opposite side of the line, other than the destruction of some of their industrial base, and lack of food and medical care.  I didn't quite find it believable that the USA would have gone along with the plan, and allow its military control to be subsumed by the new order.  It also didn't make sense to me that a woman as driven as Ebriel was, who continued to plan her own agenda even while seemingly to go along with the plans of the Chain, who had such hatred toward General Glass, would, when finally presented with the opportunity to kill him, would have a sudden change of heart.  That seemed more of a plot contrivance than a logical extension of the character's behavior.	2005-06-03

I enjoyed the first book in this series and expected to enjoy this one, but there were just too many HUH? moments by the end for me to really recommend this book.<br /><br />Subplots were started, dropped, then picked up again.  The whole threat against Sydney made no sense, the resolution of the identity of the culprit was pulled out of thin air, and the \\"rewarding\\" of the culprit just came out of the blue.  The subplot involving Sydney's aunt made no sense - she is a smart woman with her own business, she was the daughter of a lawyer, she lived in the same town with the man involved with her part of the story for all her life, the town has only 11,000 residents and she still didn't know her legal status?  Made no sense whatsoever.<br /><br />Sydney and Eric were nice characters, but they could have been much more.  Every time Eric contemplated his failed marriage, he would stop and say \\"that's water under the bridge\\".  It left the impression that there was something more interesting to that part of the story, but it was never revealed.<br /><br />All in all, after reading the book, I felt like there was a chapter or two missing.  If you read the first book in the series, you'll probably want to read this one, but to the rest of you, you're on your own.	2005-06-03

She is a woman in her early twenties, just flunked out of law school, yet she has no conception of the language of her generation and can't hold a conversation with a teen-age male (she who has two older brothers).  It made me wonder how old the author was, because Abby was too generic.  She is as nosy and as meddlesome as the worst elderly cozy-mystery character, yet we're supposed to be charmed by it.  Didn't work in my case; I just found it annoying.<br /><br />The love interest, Marco Salvare, is pretty much a clich&eacute; - a gorgeous Italian ex-cop who for some unknown reason finds her interfering ways attractive.  And you know, as a reader, you're in trouble when one of the adjectives used to describe a kiss is \\"manly\\".<br /><br />The mystery itself wasn't too bad, with a lot of red herrings, but it was pretty clear early on who was doing what.  The book was well-written but nothing special.  All in all, a rather pedestrian offering to the mystery sleuth genre.  I won't be buying the next installment.	2005-04-03

Borrow your library's copy instead.<br /><br />As was mentioned in an earlier review, the majority of the pages in this book have been used to impose what appears to be the author's sexual fantasies upon the character of Anita Blake, under the guise of the ardeur and of having the character \\"grow\\".  This book is just basic pandering to the segment of the audience that just cares about \\"hot sex scenes\\" to the exclusion of any consideration of plot or character continuity.  LKH apparently has taken the phrase \\"sex sells\\" to heart with a vengeance.  The sexual activity is so frequent, and in such a short time frame that one wonders how Anita is even able to walk.  LKH has finally managed to remove all sexual tension from a series where that was one of the highlights, by the sheer overuse of sex.  It's almost as if she was working from a check list: \\"Now let's see who hasn't Anita done, and in what position hasn't she done it?\\".  Bah!<br /><br />If you are looking for the combination horror-mystery-romance, action/adventure book that was typical of the pre-\\"Narcissus In Chains\\" books of this series, you're going to be sadly disappointed.  Up until page 385, there's only 10 - count 'em 10 - pages devoted to the crime that is highlighted on the book jacket blurb.  The rest of the pages are devoted to Anita agonizing about her various relationships and having intercourse or near-intercourse with five (or was it seven - I'm already losing track of them) different characters.  And, let's not forget the metaphysical rolling beasts - what would an Anita Blake book now be without them?  Forget that the whole concept still doesn't make any sense.  With the exception of the ardeur, none of the plot threads left hanging at the end of Cerulean Sins have been picked up.  The Mother of Darkness is non-existent, the vampire children are nowhere to be found, Belle Morte has apparently lost interest in Anita, etc.<br /><br />This book is extremely poorly edited.  The pacing is very uneven.  Continuity errors about, the spelling errors have become laughable, and basic writing errors are present throughout.  I don't know who's at fault for all that - but there's enough blame to spread around.  This is supposed to be a professional product, but it doesn't even seem as though a spell checker was used on it.  LKH's favorite words and phrases are used ad nauseam, for example \\"spill\\", \\"meat\\", \\"pulse like a piece of candy on my tongue\\", and her latest \\"taking one for the team\\" (which was funny when used for the first time in CS, but did it have to be repeated at least three times in this book?).<br /><br />I'm not even going to go into what was done with the various characters, otherwise I'll wind up writing an epic.  Richard is still emotionally off the charts, Jean-Claude is still batting clean-up, and Micah's sainthood continues to grow.  Suffice it to say, that though lip service is paid to character growth, what really occurs is further character disintegration.  Anita seems to be becoming LKH's avatar more and more, parroting the statements that have been showing up in the author's recent blogs.  It's a very sad day when an established character, one that readers have seen evolve in a logical manner over the course of numerous books suddenly turns into something completely unrecognizable, and actually something dislikable.<br /><br />Will I buy the next book?  Probably, because after all, I am hooked on the series.  Am I looking forward to it?  No.  Do I expect less sex and more plot in it?

As I was reading it, I thought to myself, \\"I'm enjoying this one just the same way I enjoy Charles deLint's stories\\".  It's one of those books that takes you out of your normal reading rut and makes you want to explore various topics raised in the book and see the places mentioned.<br /><br />It's an urban fantasy with an unusual setting - the new republics in what was formerly Soviet Central Asia.  I loved the protagonists too - a former Soviet astrophysicist now reduced to office cleaning for Mobil Oil, and a heroin-addicted, 900 year old hero from Russia's mythic past.  The developing romance between them was done quietly and beautifully.  The story is an interesting blend of modern-day reality, scifi and mythology.  The setting itself was just so interesting - the various republics that are only names in the news when something horrible happens, post-Soviet society, the changes that have been engendered, and the reactions to those changes.  For all that the Soviet system was the Big Bad Thing in Western eyes, this book shows that some good was also lost when the system collapsed.<br /><br />I read Liz William's \\"The Poison Master\\" and enjoyed that one, and now I enjoyed this book by her too.  I'm adding her to my list of must-buy authors.  I hope you'll give this book a try.	2004-09-27

However, if you're looking for a book with a decent plot and characters, give this one a pass.  The plot (a missing relative who worked for a phone sex company) is only a dressing to hang the graphic sex scenes on.  The main characters are pedestrian, with woes we've all read way too many times before (a determined widow left in debt by her profligate spouse, a divorced PI who left the police force due to an injury).

It involves two sisters who are also writers whose protagonists come to life and bring them to their respective worlds.  The premise was interesting, but the actual stories were a horrible mush of awkwardly blended medieval/Celtic/Russian mythologies and futuristic D/s encounters.

Another small, fragile, damaged woman hooking up with a large, powerful, dangerous man. Give me strength. This book was just boring. The same four facts about each of the characters kept being repeated over, and over, and over again. The plot just skipped from one point to the next, never really making things clear - why was that guy thrown over the rail of the boat, why did the secretary apparently have items belonging to her nephew in her bedroom, how the bad guys know who was on the staff of the sanitarium, what was the point of the build-up about Nico's untapped healing strength when all he did was basically staunch the flow of blood, etc.?<br /><br /> Of course, the hero has to have the required mystical background - a Lakota shaman paternal grandfather and a Japanese martial arts master maternal grandfather, and of course he was raised by both of them. Just once, once mind you, I'd like someone who had a Lakota background to have had an unexceptional childhood, parents who didn't live on a reservation, and with no shamans in the background. Or to have Japanese grandparents who worked for Toyota. He was also rather one-dimensional, with his supposed lack of socialization/relationship skills being totally unbelievable. He's basically sex-on-a-stick yet he's uncomfortable around woman? Yeah, right.<br /><br /> The heroine's &quot;psychic gifts&quot; stretched even my credulity. She can counteract the force of gravity, and make herself invisible too, by making the molecules in her body spin faster? She unwillingly gathers energy from strong emotions around her and has to discharge it by creating fireballs and setting things on fire, without ever burning herself? She's basically lived her entire life in contact with less than 10 people, people who never had any revealing conversations with her, yet she's socially functional?<br /><br /> The ending of this book seems to be setting up the upcoming ones. You just know that the GhostWalkers are going to be searching out the other women who were experimented on as children by Dr. Whitney, and each one is going to be matched up with a GhostWalker. More damaged women, more alpha males. Ho hum.<br /><br /> I don't think that I can read any more books in this series.

If you've been reading the author's other Shielder stories, then you can safely give this one a pass-by.  The only good thing about it is the small subplot where we find out how Lani and Gunnar of Leor met.  For the rest, it's just a tiresome recital of Eirene running away from this person or that planet and/or running away from her past/present, and Jarek tracking her down for the greater good of the Shielder people.  Eirene has all of the emotional range of a 13 year old (my apologies to any 13 year olds who are reading this), and Jarek is just so heroic that it's tiresome.  Although there's a lot of \\"action\\", nothing really ever happens - just a lot of people traipsing back and forth around the same portion galaxy.  And please, every humanoid species worships the same god (given that oh-so-original name, \\"Spirit\\")?  Characters from other stories have bit-part roles, but the main characters are so stereotypically semi-tragic that they become annoying.  As to their romance, it's another one of those stories where they go at each other like rabbits in heat but lack the ability to say \\"I love you\\" until the last page. By the end of the book, I didn't really care if Eirene lived or died.  Don't waste your money on this one.	2004-05-02

No way on earth does this book deserve more than two stars, and that's only for effort and good intent.<br />Where do I start?  First of all, the setting and background of the characters is very poorly established.  We are told that the women are called \\"Forestals\\", but never are we told why they are called that or what exactly \\"Forestals\\" do.  They *seem* to be some sort of interplanetary Charlie's Angels, but who really knows?  They are supposedly telepathic, yet they can't seem to recognize that ability in others, so their silent communications are easily intercepted.  They seem to be superhuman in their strength, but we don't know why.  Their handler is some sort of omnipotent mystical man, whose presence and powers seem to negate the need for the Forestals to begin with.  The scifi elements used show a basic lack of understanding of the genre and of science in general.  The characters' behaviors were inconsistent with basic Psych 101 - one of the characters was totally adverse to having any intimate contact with males, yet she undressed completely before one in her bedroom without a second thought.  The pacing of the story was off; the separate story lines weren't interwoven well.  Dramatic tension in the book was negligible.<br />But the worst thing about this book is that the author apparently never met an adjective or an adverb that she didn't want to use.  It became almost laughable as the book progressed, since she apparently tried not to repeat herself, and the descriptive phrases became stranger and sometimes seemed to even work against the scene.  I mean, \\"puissant\\" and \\"labile\\" are fine words, but they just didn't flow with the story.  In her quest to use new and unique descriptive terms, she made the characters' actions and statements excessively dramatic.  Some of the descriptive terms used in connection with one of the heroes made his pursuit seem more like stalking and rape, rather than anything romantic.  The sex scenes were neither romantic nor interesting (\\"shrill shrieks\\"? Give me a break!).<br />This book is definitely not worth the trade paperback price.rather than anything romantic.

Hamilton has got to be flattered by Melanie Lee Bonnefoux's \\"Blood and Mind\\". I just finished reading it, and did enjoy it. For those of you craving an Anita Blake fix while waiting for the next book, this book would probably fill the bill, especially if you're into the vampire-human/human-human romance aspects of the Anitaverse.<br />Best way to describe the story would be to say \\"throw the Anitaverse into a blender and add a little Buffy\\".  A lot of the scenarios are going to be *very* familiar to LKH's fans.  In this world, laws have been recently passed making vampires legal - surprise! The main character is a female college student (with dark hair) who is an Empath with extraordinarily high PSI abilities. Naturally this makes her extremely attractive to the vampire Holder (read \\"Master\\") of the city, who is, of course, gorgeous, but who has a faint British (not French) accent.  Sound vaguely familiar? She becomes his human \\"Companion\\" basically against her will and tries to resist her sexual attraction to him.  Now, where have I read that before?  Because of her abilities, she gets involved with a series of murders that are happening in the human and vampire communities, and surprise, surprise, winds up assisting a very tall detective on the case.  She is self-assured, intelligent, easily aggravated, and emotionally locked-down.  She differs from Anita Blake in that she hates her dead mother, because her mother always hated her because she was \\"different\\".  Still, the \\"mother issue\\" is very familiar...<br />As I said, I liked the story, and would like to see a sequel to it. The story was fast-moving and interesting, and I really did like the characters.  They were all different enough that they became their own persons as the story progressed.  Be warned, though, that this is a first novel, issued through a non-mainline publishing house, so the copy editing is almost non-existent. The run-on sentences and punctuation errors alone almost drove me crazy (anyone ever hear of ending a question with a question mark?), and there were quite a few spelling errors (e.g. \\"cow tow\\" instead of \\"kowtow\\") which should have been caught.un-on sentences and punctuation errors alone almost drove me crazy (anyone ever hear of ending a question with a question mark?), and there were quite a few spelling errors (e.g. \\"cow tow\\" instead of \\"kowtow\\") which should have been caught.	2004-01-19

A wise decision on my part.  This was just such a fun and romantic book, it has definitely made Susan Donovan one of my favorite authors.  A previous reviewer made a comparison to Jennifer Crusie, and I would say that if you like Crusie's work (which I do) you'll enjoy this book.<br />Once again, Ms. Donovan has managed to create well-rounded primary and secondary characters who are really interesting and who have real-life concerns and problems.  The push-pull of the relationship between the hero and heroine seemed both realistic and romantic, the subplot concerning her &quot;daughter&quot; was well done, and she has a deft hand with comedy.  The murder mystery, while no suprise to the reader, was a neat way of tying various plot threads together.  And I even wound up liking the dog in the story, since the author gave us insights to his thoughts and made him a character in his own right (how can you not like a tiny dog who refers to his owner as &quot;Big Alpha&quot;?).	2003-10-28

The basic premise is that our heroine, Joy, is accompanying her friend Roxy on a trip to the Czech Republic to try to visit a reclusive author of romantic vampire fiction and to explore whether or not vampires do exist.  Joy is a disbeliever but she doesn't want Roxy to do this on her own, so she agrees to go along.  Naturally, Joy is the one the vampire takes an interest in.  In her acknowledgements Ms. MacAlister thanks Christine Feehan, so it's not surprising that the reclusive author's vampires have a marked tongue-in-cheek resemblance to Feehan's Carpathians, including the inclusion of a series of steps to soulmate-hood.  If you like Feehan's books, you'll enjoy Roxy's obsession with the Rules of the Dark Ones.<br />This book was just so funny in sections that I laughed out loud.  The heroine wasn't a petite little thing (a wonderful change of pace); the hero was mysterious and sexy; the setting was a nice change of pace - a GothFest in the Czech Republic; and the secondary characters were fleshed out enough to make them interesting and relevant.  All and all, it was just a fun book and I enjoyed it.	2003-10-27

The (excuse the pun) &quot;fish out of water&quot; scenario was done much better in that one, the dialogue was sharper and the pace was faster, and the mythology didn't overwhelm the story.<br />Right off the bat we're introduced to the heroine who is a sargeant in the Air Force who is afraid of flying.  To me, that little quirk wasn't cute, it was annoying.  Everything that happened after that was very predictable.  The book seemed to be sort of an unsuccessful blending of the films &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; and &quot;Sister Act&quot;.<br />I think the problem with this book was that there was just too much emphasis on the whole Earth Mother relationship and not enough on the characters themselves - they were too one-dimensional, the good guys were all good, the bad guys were all bad.  At times I just felt that I was being lectured to - as if the author had attended one of those &quot;Goddess Within The Feminine&quot;-type seminars and was determined to tell us everything she had learned.  It just didn't work well because it was too heavy-handed.  I kept thinking to myself as I read the book &quot;I know that stuff already, get on with the story!&quot;.<br />Here's hoping that her next book is better than this one, because I like the basic premise of her stories and I think she can do a lot more with them.	2003-10-25

The book played up all the emotional heartstrings, but it left me rather cold.<br />I found the main character, Emma, to be extremely annoying and selfish.  Perhaps it's just that I have a differing viewpoint of death and suicide, but I just couldn't understand the survivor guilt.  Emma's dogged pursuit for the reason behind her father's suicide, knowing full well that any verification of it would jeopardize the insurance money that her family desperately needs, just made no sense to me.  I disliked the fact that she began the investigation and involved a public official in it unilaterally, never bothering to discuss her action with her mother or her siblings until after the fact.  Also, coming from a family where my mother was widowed young, I had absolutely no sympathy with the mother locking herself away for weeks in her room nursing her own hurt and anger when her children needed her.  My mother never behaved that way, no matter how much she was hurting.  Perhaps this reflects a real-life experience, I don't know, but I could not respect the mother after that.<br />Regarding the romance between Emma and Matt, this was one of those situations where you have this gorgeous bad-boy who's made good type in love with a woman forever, she loves him, but she's afraid to commit to him because she has an independent life elsewhere.  Nevermind that in that other life she's basically a glorified shop clerk who's never going to be able to do the job she actually wants to do, nevermind that she apparently has no social life and only a limited amount of friends.  THAT life is better in her eyes than being with a man whose love she reciprocates, having her beloved family nearby, and the possiblity of owning her own antiques business.  Just made me want to give her a smack upside her head.	2003-10-18

There's only enough story here for a novella, but it seems as though it has been padded out in order to publish it as a novel.<br />Now, Feehan's Carpathian series is a guilty pleasure for me - not great literature but usually a fun read.  In this book she tries to take her usual format and impose it on a real world setting involving the testing/training of an elite group of soldiers/volunteers in the paranormal arts.  It doesn't work.  The whole soulmates-who-are-driven-to-conjoin scenario played to the extent that Feehan does just doesn't work without the fantasy element.  It becomes rather ridiculous instead of romantic.<br />The problem is, there's just not enough story to support the cast of characters she's created.  So we get pages and pages of duplicated information (first the hero and heroine have the discussion telepathically, then they have it verbally), pages and pages of gratuitous sex (and vanilla sex at that), and glaring plot holes (we're warned several times that it's not good when the heroine has nothing to occupy the great brain of hers but there's no scene where she's put in that position; she's managed to get her doctorate yet she's so totally clueless about sex (and still &quot;untried&quot;) that she has to order sex manuals off the internet to figure out what to do and yet she and the hero irresponsibly and consistently have unprotected sex; she's supposed to be this brilliant researcher yet we're never told what actually she's working on; the research corporation she works for, and in which her family is the majority stockholder, is practicing inhumane testing methods on the soldiers yet she doesn't do anything to pull the plug on the corporation and in fact goes to a fund-raiser to raise more money for them!)<br />The only bright spot in the book were the scenes with the soldiers and the dialogue between them.  That's the only spot of humor in the book.  The heroine almost falls into the too-stupid-to-live category, and the hero is so alpha male and possessive that you wonder how he manages to get anything done and why his team just doesn't turn on him.ive category, and the hero is so alpha male and possessive that you wonder how he manages to get anything done and why his team just doesn't turn on him.	2003-10-13

There is very little plot, very little character development, and the romantic scenes between Jamie and Max lack any kind of believable sexual tension or romance, for that matter.<br />I definitely disagree that this book was better than the first two.  In no way, shape or form does the humor in this book match that in Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series.  In those books, the humor flows from one scene to the other.  In this book there are only brief snippets and most of them concern Fleas, the bloodhound Jamie \\"buys\\".  Any reader of Evanovich could probably pick out the few scenes she worked on.  The plot is almost abysmally simple and cliched - Max and Jamie are trying to get the goods on a shady preacher, Max doesn't want Jamie to come along so that she doesn't get hurt, Jamie plays intrepid girl reporter trying to get her \\"big story\\", a mobster is blackmailing/controlling the preacher, a murder occurs, yadda yadda yadda.  We've been there, done that in too many books, and there's no new twist on it in this one.<br />By the end of this book, I just found Jamie to be annoying and the scenes of \\"sexus interruptus\\" way too predictable and frequent.  In this book, Jamie and Max are totally one-note characters lacking any kind of personal depth - if you didn't read the earlier books I don't think that you would care at all what happens to the characters.  The secondary characters - the mobster, the preacher, and the sidekick - are all very stereotypical.  You know it's bad when you're reading a story and you're rewriting the characters in your mind to make them more interesting.<br />I've always bought Evanovich's and Hughes' separate books and have enjoyed them.  I'll probably continue to do so.  I doubt, though, that I'll buy anymore of their Jamie Swift/Max Holt collaborations - I'm just not interested anymore.	2003-09-13

It has one of those pink cartoony covers that seems to denote a certain style of romance that is usually rather light.  As a result of that impulse, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself reading a very entertaining book and discovered a new favorite author.<br />Autumn Adams is an unloved daughter who makes a death-bed promise to her journalist mother to carry on her helpful hints column.  Audie, as she's known to her friends, has no homemaking skills whatsoever, but she is photogenic and becomes a star in her own right.  Unfortunately for her, someone is planning to kill her.  Into the story enters Detective Stacey Quinn, and the story traces their mutual attraction, his family, the threats on her, and the family history that has stunted her emotions.<br />The main characters are engaging, the dialogue is fast-paced and realistic, the secondary characters are sufficiently developed to make them interesting, and the mystery works well to drive the plot (even though I guessed early on who the bad guy was).  I wound up liking the characters in the book, liking the way the relationship developed, liking their quirks and foibles.  It's one of those books that once you start it, you have to finish it.  And, based on the included teaser for Ms. Donovan's next book, I'll be buying that one also.	2002-12-26

I've read both books, and while my preference is the earlier version, readers who haven't read that one will surely enjoy this version.  The earlier version seemed tighter plot-wise, but the additions made in the new version fall in nicely with the tone of the book.<br />If you like Ms. Evanovich's writing, you will like this book.  The dialogue is interesting and witty.  The romance/sexual tension is nicely done.  I really liked the character of Billie, a divorced mom with two kids who's also an excellent sixth grade teacher.  She was a nice change of pace.  Nick is one of Ms. Evanovich's classic sexy male lead characters - always a treat.  The secondary characters are nicely quirkly (a former beauty queen, professional wrestlers, a pest control professional, a boy genius, etc.), and of course there is an exploding car.<br />Since we have to wait at least a year for a new Stephanie Plum novel, this book will serve nicely to fill the publishing gap.	2002-09-06

I bought this book used as a result of a Listmania recommendation, and boy, am I glad that I did!  This is a great romantic suspense story, with a strikingly original, morally ambiguous male lead character.  It really pushes the envelope on what type of behavior in a hero is acceptable, and succeeds in making the reader accept it all.<br />Rachel Connery is a woman consumed by pain, hatred and fear - a product of her mother's constant neglect and her stepfather's abuse.  Her mother recently died, but before she did she liquidated all of her assets, drained Rachel's trust fund, sold off some of Rachel's possessions, and willed everything to the Foundation of Being, a New-Age type of spiritual retreat headed up by Luke Bardell.  Luke, who as a child found his mother after she committed suicide, who survived the beatings of his stepfather, who was convicted of manslaughter and served time in prison, and who has been a con man most of his life, is now running the best con of his life - a Foundation where he is viewed as virtually a messiah.  Rachel suspects that the Foundation is all a sham, that the cancer deaths that have been occurring in the hospice there have had more to do with the patient's bank balance than actual illness, and has vowed to expose Luke in order to recover her lost inheritance.<br />The story reveals the souls of these two emotionally scarred people as they play a cat-and-mouse game with both the truth and their mutual attraction.  Luke is the ultimate bad-boy hero, and Ms. Stuart has managed to make him as attractive as sin.  The reader keeps waiting for him to behave in some standard heroic fashion, yet he continues to follow his own path to achieve his goals.  Rachel is gradually transformed from an embittered person who just exists, to a person who actually lives.<br />If you can find a copy of this book, get it.  It's definitely worth your time.	2002-09-05

US	52593236	REYBA8F0E1UH1	0425180980	29643847	A Prince of a Guy	Books	2	4	4	N	N	Missing The Romantic Spark	I have very mixed feelings about this book.  On one hand, the story had a few interesting bits and pieces, but on the other, it never became a book that I couldn't put down.  It never truly flowed well.  The emotions of the characters were too superficial, and the introduction of a secondary love interest for the character Kate broke the flow of the main romance.  I think the main problem was the character of Kate.  There was nothing unique about her character - she was the stereotypical, self-important psychologist who had an almost pathological hatred of sports, which just never was believable.  Her narrow-mindedness and gullibility became annoying after a while.  While the character Jeff fell more and more in love with her, the source of the attraction eluded me.  He actually seemed too good for her.  The secondary characters never had much personality and really added very little to the story.<br />Romantic tension was stated rather than created, giving the reader no emotional involvement in the story.  Time seemed to just flow in the story without much of anything happening.  There was a strange interlude where everyone went water skiing, which really made no sense, since it didn't seem as though the \\"sport experience\\" changed Kate's attitude at all.  If you want a rather tame romance with no explicit scenes, and where the moral of the story is that true love doesn't necessarily have to conform to rigid rules, then this is the book for you.	2002-08-10

This review is about listening to the audiobook version of this story.<br />I've listened to the unabridged audiobook version of KOS and I have to say that I really enjoyed it.  At first I was a little disconcerted that one woman was doing all of the narration.  Given the number of male characters in this story I thought for sure that they would have a man read those parts.  But Laural Merlington is a gifted reader and unlike some other narrators I've heard, she has managed to give each character his or her own voice.  As the tapes progressed, it was easy to identify which character was speaking by the voice characteristics alone.  And given the typical number of characters in LKH's books, this is to be commended.<br />I had already read this book in hardcover and knew the story well, but I have to say that listening to it was a whole new experience.  I heard things that I must have glossed over when reading the book.  It made the characters much more alive.  For fans of the Merry Gentry series, I would definitely recommend getting the unabridged audiobook.  Check all possible sources if you're interested in buying it, because I've found a very wide variety of prices and was able to purchase it a much discounted price.	2002-07-25
US	52593236	RW418K408SG8J	0553802186	333134566	Safe Harbor	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Interesting Beginning But...	This book is fine as a beach book, but don't look for more than that.  But if that's what you're looking for, then you'll enjoy this story of an aunt who is forced to become the guardian of her two young nieces after the death of her beloved sister.  I liked the change of pace romance - when we first meet the romantic leads, he is eight years old and she is twenty.  She's his sailing instructor and saves him when he almost drowns.  The story is then resumed twenty-one years later.<br />The aunt is an interesting character because she is clearly not maternal, and is used to living a life as an artist, most recently in France.  While she loves her nieces, it's obvious that being forced to take care of two children and live in a place where she is surrounded by memories of her sister is not her idea of happiness.  The two nieces, while precocious, were believable as children who had been orphaned.  The book provides a nice image of a New England coastline summer, and the references to Newport brought back memories.  The romance perked along nicely, with the usual conflicts brought upon by the aunt's insecurity due to a recent disasterous romance.  My only problem with the book was that the denouement of the problem in the parents' marriage didn't match the tension that had been built up, and was rather disappointing because the reason was rather silly.  But the rest of the book was enjoyable enough to make up for that, so I ended up liking the book.	2002-07-25

I had read the previews about it and bought it as soon as it came out.  The basic premise is one that's been done by many romance authors - that of a trio of gorgeous bachelor brothers who are doing all they can to avoid marriage, and the women who manage to snag them.  The stories are usually predictable but the route to the conclusion is usually romantic and fun.<br />This book went from fun to just plain silly.  The author tried to make the female characters complex, but then she undercut the seriousness by having them behave immaturely.  The mother lays a guilt trip on her sons to get married because she wants them to be happy and give her a grandchild.  She does this by faking a heart condition which all three sons accept without question.  Now I don't know about the rest of you, but when my mother became ill, I researched as much as I could about her condition and I could almost quote symptoms in my sleep.  These three supposedly educated men apparently never did that.  The lead female character has a mother who is obviously mentally ill, but she never seems to recognize that fact.  She says that she wants to avoid the mistakes her mother made, yet she is just as rigid as her mother regarding leaving her hometown.  Her best friend has breast augmentation done to satisfy her fiance's idea of perfection.  It's rare in a romance where all of the women were annoying, but this book managed it.  The most reasonable (read mature) characters in the book were the brothers.  And to top it all off, the big mystery in the book involved a series of burglaries in which the only thing stolen are crocheted panties.  The perpetrator was extremely obvious.<br />There were some nicely written scenes and dialogue, there were some interesting family problems touched upon, and the chemistry between the male and female leads was good.  But the book always remained superficial and never, in my opinion, really realized its potential.its potential.	2002-07-24

This year I made sure that I read this sequel.  I've definitely put Ms. Bissell on my must-read list.<br />Mary Crow is an intriguing character.  She's obviously a dedicated public servant, yet she is also a product of her upbringing, someone raised out of the urban setting.  Her ethnic heritage is mixed and she's still trying to reconcile who she is and who her parents were, but not to the point where introspection become repetitive or boring.  She tries to do her best, but even though her forest skills are above average, she's not superwoman and still makes dumb mistakes.  This book involved an increasing number of deaths of federal judges, all without apparent rhyme or reason.  The FBI knows there is a conspiracy, but they can't pinpoint the origin.  The obvious next target is a very stubborn judge, living on a horse-breeding farm, who Mary considers to be almost a surrogate mother.  Mary is recruited as a volunteer by the FBI to try to protect her, since the judge will not agree to any other form of protection.  The setting is out in the country - at the judge's farm, at an old sanitorium, and in the surrounding woods.<br />The book is tightly plotted and well written.  The evil presented is believable.  The characters and their relationship to one another all have depth.  If you read the first one, you'll definitely want to read this one.  Each Mary Crow novel can be read as a stand-alone book, but I'd recommend reading them in order for maximum enjoyment.	2002-07-24

That doesn't hold true for many authors.  I've read a number of her contemporary romances so far, and each has held my attention and entertained me.<br />This book is no exception. The plot has already been detailed in another review, but know that Ms. Rice has created interesting and realistic characters, ones who act and react in believable ways.  Each character has some hidden depth that is initially unsuspected.  Also, she creates multiple subplots which enhance and advance the storyline.  In addition to romantic arc, there are also subplots involving a father's discovery of an unknown son, industrial espionage involving computer software, the return of a prodigal mother, a murder, and a community/personal battle over corporate vs. private interests.  The prodigal mother subplot, for example, doesn't follow the typical restoration-of-a-loved-one route.  I especially enjoy that she tells the story from both JD's and Nina's perspectives, allowing us access to their emotions.  I found that the multitude of characters enhanced rather than detracted from the story.  Each was integral to his/her portion of the storyline.<br />If you like the writings of Karen Robards and Susan Elizabeth Phillips, then Patricia Rice should definitely be added to your \\"must-read\\" list.	2002-07-01

What makes this a fun book is that Glory tries to make it perfectly clear to the three mages (who inadvertently abduct her during their search for a hero to save their people) that she is not the hero they are looking for, she only plays one on TV.  She doesn't try to disguise her lack of heroic capability, which is a refreshing change of pace.  She's a woman who knows her limitations but who is put in an extrodinary situation, where she can either choose to rise to the challenge or walk away.<br />This book is a fast, funny and enjoyable read.  There are many tongue-in-cheek pop culture references, and Glory has a wry sense of humor, especially when it comes to her Vixen costume and the importance of a sidekick.  This book isn't going to reveal the secrets of the universe or dramatically change your life.  It will, however, provide a few hours of good entertainment.  Hopefully, it'll become a series.  I, for one, want to read more about Glory's adventures	2002-06-30

This is due to the fact that the author has made the characters totally human and realistic, rather than caricatures.  The dialogue is sharp and funny, the situations both humorous and heart-breaking, the romance sexy and amusing, the writing deft.  These are characters you take to your heart:  George, a man who is so much more than the cartoonish image of a professional wrestler; Alizon, a girl forced to take charge of her life earlier than anyone should; Pippa, who's death would have been a sorry loss; Reyne, a living lesson of the results of superstition.  George's initial belief that what was happening to him was just a dream induced by a hypnotherapy session with his sister, and his subsequent attempts to psychoanalyze the meaning of it all was hilarious.

The book was published in 1994 so that explains it.  But even so, this is another funny and entertaining book by Ms. Cruisie, with sharply drawn characters and crisp dialogue.<br />I intially wasn't drawn to Tess Newhart - she's in her mid-thirties and still living in a thrift-store-furnished apartment, getting involved with protests, etc.  My first reaction was \\"grow up already\\".  But the more I read the more I liked her and felt in sympathy with her.  Nick Jamieson is more than the standard smooth-talking lawyer he appears to be, even if it seems as though making partner is his sole goal in life.  There is some classic rapid-fire dialogue between Tess and Nick, and the \\"conversations\\" Nick has with his secretary Christine are worth the price of the book alone.  Secondary plots concern an unsuitable romance between Tess and Nick's best friends (a retired chorus girl and a well-heeled partner in the law firm), and a possible case of literary plagerism.<br />Tess and Nick's relationship is both humorous and romantic, their sexual encounters are inventive and sensual, and the secondary characters round out the story nicely.

The mistaken identity theme concerns the thirty-somethings' romance, and there's also a romance between a \\"mature\\" couple that puts a new twist on the older woman/younger man storyline.  Both romances are fun, sexy, and true to their characters.<br />Dennie Banks is stuck in a dead-end society page reporter's job and decides to take charge of her life and get an interview with a famous writer who's know for her astute observations about interpersonal relationships.  However Dennie has just gotten the scoop that the writer is on the verge of a divorce, and she sees this as her chance for the big time.  Alec Prentice works for the government investigating fraud cases.  He is on the trail of a land swindler, and just happens to wind up at the same conference that Dennie is attending.  Of course, he mistakes her for the swindler's accomplice, and the story takes off from there.  It is pure fun to watch two people who are used to getting their own way on charm alone finally meet their match.<br />In other hands this would be a trite and ho-hum story, but Ms. Crusie's excellent characterizations and sharp dialogue make this a joy to read.  What I like best about her writing is that she lets you know all of the main characters' thoughts and emotions, not just the female lead.  This is one book that is worth finding, and here's hoping that it'll be reissued soon.	2002-06-07

Alex is her downstairs neighbor, an emergency room doctor, and a serial dater.  However, once he meets her, his life plans change and he sets out trying to find a way to convince her that she belongs in his life.  Add to this mix Alex' brother Max (a gynecologist), Nina's friend Charity (who's about to write a book on her 12-man string of failed romances), and Fred (a part manic-depressive stray dog who's got a severe Oreo jones) and there are more than enough opportunities for the humorous scenes that Ms. Crusie does so well.<br />Nina and Alex are obviously a couple who are meant for each other, but before true love can triumph each must overcome their own personal obstacles - Nina's problem with dating someone so much younger, and Alex' family pressures and mistaken goals.  But the story doesn't bog down with angst, and everything is leavened with humor.  And, I was especially glad to see Nina's 40 year old self taking center stage, rather than being relegated to being a secondary character.  It's so refreshing to read a romance that doesn't contain a dewy twenty-something &lt;grin&gt;. This is a fun book, and it's worth searching out and buying.	2002-06-07

I am a fan of the vampire genre and it takes an awful lot for me not to like a book, but I didn't enjoy this one.<br />From the synopsis, it seemed as though it was going to be really interesting, and I liked the fact that the main protagonist was a female rather than the usual male vampire.  However, the thought that remained uppermost in my mind as I read this book was that it was written with the dollar signs of a future film rights sale uppermost in the author's mind.  From the character descriptions, to the locales, to the sexual relationships, it was clear that the most important thing was how this all would look on the screen, rather than how it flowed as a novel.<br />The intial premise of the Keepers and their relation to the humans was interesting, but it was never really depicted well.  The reader is just lectured about it.  The behavior of the characters Miriam and Paul was just strange and rather disjointed.  Not strange in \\"oh, how unusual\\" way, but more of the head-scratching kind of strange.  I felt no empathy to any of the characters, and without that the book was dull.  Also, the ending was a very obvious set-up for the next book in this series.<br />If you really want to read this book, I'd say take it out of the library rather than wasting your money on it.	2002-06-01

This is apparently a very early work by her, but even so, all of her classic elements are there - intelligent women, a gorgeous guy, witty dialogue and a sexy romance.<br />Emily Tate is a brilliant marketer and is in charge of a new perfume campaign.  Her last project, though wildly successful, went way over budget so (gorgeous and extremely sexy) Richard Parker has been hired by the firm as a number-cruncher to keep the various projects under budget.  Also involved in the story is Emily's best friend/secretary Jane, who's been with her since their school days, knows all the skeletons, and who helps to keep her on track.  Needless to say, there is immediate attraction between Emily and Richard, but there are also some major obstacles, such as his stubborness and seemingly inablility to listen to her.<br />This book mainly consists of dialogue and witty repartee between the various characters. Example:  \\"You're looking very chipper this morning.\\"  \\"Thank you.\\"  \\"Your underpants are on your desk.\\"  \\"What?\\"  \\"The cleaners found them in the conference room and put them on the lost-and-found bulletin board. Real clowns, those cleaners.\\"  \\"Does anybody know?\\"  \\"Absolutely not. I was the first one here. And I only knew they were yours because I bought them for you.\\"  \\"You get a raise.\\"  \\"Thank you. I deserve one. Who was the lucky man?\\"<br />I rated this book four stars instead of five because the story is only told from Emily's viewpoint - we never share Richard's thoughts.  I guess that that's one of the drawbacks of the short format, and one that isn't present in Ms. Crusie's later books. If you're a fan of Ms. Crusie's writing, then this is one that's definitely worth searching for.  If you've never read her before and the cost of the used version is too high for you, then try her in-print books - you're sure to enjoy them too.	2002-05-31

When I found out that it was a Harlequin book, I figured that the whole vampire aspect was going to be pretty generic, but to my surprise it wasn't. Ms. St. George provided a very plausible explantion for vampirism, and also gave the secondary vampire characters some real emotional depth, rather than just making them stereotypes.<br />Trevor d'Laine is a late-night radio talk show DJ. He markets himself as a vampire DJ (never appearing at daytime events, not allowing himself to be photographed, etc.), which of course his listeners don't really believe. For him, though this is a case of hiding in plain sight. His mortal assistant recently died and he has to hire a replacement to handle his daytime affairs - a person know as a \\"Renfield\\" in the vampire community, a term lifted with derision by them from Bram Stoker's book. In fact, all of the mortal assistants are referred to as Renfields by their vampire employers, and they refer to themselves that way too. Kay Erickson happens to be the only person who was willing to show up for a 2am interview with him for the job, and he hires her. Both of the characters have surprising depth: he positively exudes joie de vivre, and is in the process of organinzing the vampire community to make it more acceptable to the human community, while she is engaged to a man who may or may not be right for her and who is still trying to overcome a childhood that was suffocated by her mother's fears. Needless to say, she has a hard time accepting the truth about Trevor's nature, and she actually responds in a realistic fashion to the truths revealed to her, rather than than just accepting them matter-of-factly.<br />The book is fast paced, with some thoughtful insights into vampirism and personal choice. The mystery, while not very mysterious, was a nice little additon. The growing attraction between Trevor and Kay was done well - romantic and sexy, yet with realistic consideration to physical and philosophical differences. This book is out-of-print but is available used. If you enjoy the vampire/romance genre, this is one book worth adding to your collection.- romantic and sexy, yet with realistic consideration to physical and philosophical differences.

If you've enjoyed Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series, you're going to get a kick out of her stories for the Loveswept Romance imprint.<br />This one tells the story of Megan Murphy, a potter who works part-time as a weekend aide in Colonial Williamsburg, and Patrick Hunter, a newly minted doctor who's taken over a pediatrician's practice there.  They meet as a result of a rabbit attack and have to deal with one another because of a temporarily abandoned baby.  There's instant... chemistry between them that they both immediately (but not very successfully) try to tone down, and the mixed joy of pretend parenthood as they both try to take care of the baby.  Of course, both of them have commitment issues - Megan as a result of her past, and Patrick due to his uncertain future.  But since this is an Evanovich book, it isn't bogged down with excessive introspection and instead perks along with witty repartee, the aforementioned cute baby, a suspiciously overweight horse, matchmaking sets of parents, a former suitor who's a victim of a dart attack, and, needless to say, a destroyed car.<br />If you can find a copy of this book, it's definitely worth buying for the amount of amusement and sweet romance it provides.	2002-05-30

This book is currently out of print but it's scheduled to be reissued in an expanded form in September 2002 after being rewritten by Janet Evanovich and Charlotte Hughes.  It's a funny and engaging book in its original form, and I'm looking forward to the expanded rewrite.<br />Billie Pierce is the epitomy of a suburban mom.  She lives in a well-to-do suburban development, has two kids, is a 6th grade teacher, and is happy being a homemaker.  The only glitch in the picture is that Mr. Pierce hit his mid-life crisis at an early age, so for the past four years Billie has been a divorced mom, too.  She decides that she needs more exercise in her life, so she signs up for polo lessons, given by Nick Kaharchek, a local polo-playing, horse-farm-owning, millionaire/publisher.  When signing up she neglected to mention that while she's been around horses all her life, she's never actually been on one.  Needless to say, Nick usually doesn't pursue women of Billie's type, but the air of fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies that surrounds her is almost more than he can resist.  She, on the other hand, can recognize danger when it's staring into her eyes and resolves to keep her distance.  Uh huh, yeah, sure.<br />Of course, since this is an Evanovich book, the secondary characters are not bland two-dimensional characters.  There's Deedee, Nick's many-times married cousin, who's now engaged to be married to a professional wrestler, and who Nick cons Billie into housing; Frankie The Assassin, a professional wrestler who's Deedee's fiance; Eugene, Nick's precocious cousin who blows things up in order to get his point across; and an assortment of pro wrestlers that Deedee tries to fix Billie up with.<br />This was a fun book with a lot of witty dialogue, well-written scenes and characters, and sexy and humorous romance.

I would have given it five stars but some of the scenes seemed to shift abruptly - I don't know if it was written that way or just poorly edited.<br />This book is a nice blend of fantasy, supernatural and military elements, with a touch of romance to boot.  The main character is Tevra who is a Colonel in the Light Cavalry of the Kingdom and who has been sent by the King as Viceroy to resolve the corruption in the misogynistic Forest Kingdom.  She is accompanied by her brilliant second-in-command Hetwith, and is aided, strangely enough, by the deposed Forest King, Dard, who is also a wizard.  Tevra is a person of high principles who's always defined herself by her military position.  The story follows her attempts to familiarize herself with the ways of the Forest Kingdom and handle people and situations totally alien to her training, while dealing with treachery, corruption, rebels, and assasination attempts.<br />This isn't a massive book - Ms. Edwards was able to create this world and its inhabitants with deft precision.  Tevra is slowly revealed to be a person who has triumphed over her origins by making her military career the be-all and end-all of her existence, somewhat to her detriment.  As the book evolves, so does she, with the help of the two people she winds up depending on more than she wants.<br />This is the second book by Ms. Edwards that I've read, and I've enjoyed both of them.  I've only found mention of four books written by her, all in the late 1980's, and biographic information about her is almost non-existent.  Here's hoping that someday she resumes writing in this genre.	2002-05-29

If you like those authors, or like supernatural/paranormal  aspects to your mysteries, then you'll enjoy this series.  This particular story is the fourth in the series, and I would recommend reading the series from the beginning.  There is a secondary story arc (concerning a long-missing wealthy man's daughter, a woman in a catatonic state, and an apparent assasination plot) that is continuing throughout the series, and while each book can stand alone since the previous book's plot developments are summarized at the beginning of each new one, I think that you get a better feel for what Black Oak is and who the main characters are by reading it from the beginning.  Of course, having said that, know that the first book is now listed as out-of-print, but I recently found it in a major-chain bookstore, so copies are out there.<br />Black Oak is a security investigation firm headed by Ethan Proctor.  The firm investigates standard business scams, but Proctor also takes on special cases, scams that seem to involve some sort of supernatural aspect that he tries to debunk.  As this particular story begins, Proctor is burned out and his firm has lost it's most lucrative client.  He is coerced by his concerned employees into taking a short vacation in Atlantic City, just to regain his focus.  Of course, his visit to AC also coincides with a series of horrible mutilation murders that are occuring in the city, and to top it off a strong winter storm is about to hit the city.  If you don't already know it, Atlantic City is on a barrier island alongside the NJ mainland, and when there is excess rainfall the roads flood out and cut the city off.  Guess what happens when the rain starts to fall in this book?<br />Proctor and his two employees, Taz and Doc, are unwillingly drawn into the investigation of the murders, and it soon becomes apparent that the killer is not an ordinary being.  This book reintroduces a character who intially appeared in the first book and hopefully will continue to appear in the series.  This book is a great mixture of police/PI procedural and horror.

I already knew that the book would be dense with detail and the characters complex.  I also knew that the plot and characters would go in directions that I had neither imagined nor desired.  I also knew that the odds were good that the ending would make me long for a sequel.  In this book, my expectations were once again met.<br />Even knowing all that, I still can't figure out why IN CONQUEST BORN seems to be stuck in my mind.  This book is more hard science fiction than the Coldfire Trilogy; it's a genre that I don't normally read much.  The two main protagonists, Zatar and Anzha, are people that you would definitely steer clear of, if you met them in real life.  Both are strong-willed, determined, driven by hatred, and ruthless.  Yet for some reason, each has their own version of honor, compassion, and loyalty, and this makes them in some way surprisingly sympathetic.  This dichotomy drives both the story and the characters.  The Braxin and Azean societies are total opposites, yet both are so clearly drawn that you're able to understand why the characters behave the way they do, and accept that it makes total sense in their society's context, even though it may appear totally alien to your own.  Ms. Friedman once again has shown her excellent world-building skills in this book.<br />The briefest synopsis of the plot is that the empires of Braxi and Azea have been involved in a multi-generational interstellar war.  Braxi sees glory in war, Azea fights to preserve peace.  Braxin society is very stratified, with a ruling class that has manipulated their genetics by ruthless evolution, while the Azeans have ruthlessly manipulated their genetics by science.  The story tells of Zatar of Braxi's and Anzha of Azea's growth from childhood and adulthood, both groomed for leadership, one knowingly and one unwittingly.  Both characters are complex, so there is no easily labelled good one or bad one.  Of course the two of them become aware of each other and become sworn enemies.  The story just expands from there.<br />If you're looking for an interesting, engrossing, challenging story, then this is for you.  And in the end, that just may be why I liked it so much.re complex, so there is no easily labelled good one or bad one.

Peril had a secret reason for needing a virtuous wife, and the abbess suspects his motives.  The abbess also has another problem - a troublesome novice named Eloise who's lived at the convent since age twelve and considers herself an abbess-in-training, much to the current abbess' annoyance.  Two birds are killed with one stone when the abbess sends novice Eloise disguised as a nun with Peril back to estate, with the charge that she act as a husband judge to determine his suitability as husband for one of the convent's maidens.  To Eloise, this is finally confirmation that the abbess and the convent value her, and she sets out to do the most consciencious job possible.<br />The story follows the familiar path of an intelligent, energetic woman arriving at an estate that has fallen to ruin.  Of course she begins to take charge and reform both the estate and the earl.  Of course he both resents and is attracted to her.  Of course he thinks that she is a nun and tries to overcome his attraction.  Of course she is attracted to him and has to decide what life path to follow.  So all the basic and familiar romance elements are here, yet Ms Krahn manages to mix them in such a fashion that they seem fresh and interesting.  I liked the fact that both Eloise's and Peril's viewpoints are told.  The story is well-paced and interesting, the humor wry.<br />I enjoyed the main characters in this story, and the story itself.  The only reason why I gave it four stars instead of five is because I felt that the secondary plots and characters could have been more fully developed.  But that is only a minor quibble.  This book was an amusing and enjoyable way to spend an afternoon.	2002-05-04

You could probably read it in a piecemeal fashion, but I don't think that it would have the same impact, because both the characters and the world of Eldh are evolving as the series goes on.  This book is setting the stage for the upcoming battle for control of Eldh, revealing the main players and getting the pieces into place.<br />This book picks up the story after the catastrophe at the Etherion.  The cast of characters has been split into two groups: Travis, Durge, Sareth and Lirith have traveled back in time to Castle City Colorado on Earth in 1883, while Grace, Falken, Ayrn, Beltan, Melia, and Vani have remained in the city of Tarras in present-day Eldh.  The two main subplots are concerned with getting the Earth-bound travelers back to Eldh, while the group on Eldh are trying to get to Toringarth to get the pieces of the only weapon that will prevent the Pale King from taking over the Dominions.  Needless to say, this is an extreme simplification of the plot.  The group on Earth has to deal with a rogue sorcerer, a vigilante group, corruption, the arrival of Jack Graystone, racial prejudice, and the sheer problem of staying alive.  The group on Eldh has to face the resurgent Raven cult, the announcement of Aryn's betrothal (to her surprise), their pursuit by the Onyx Knights, the mystery of Toringarth, and the secret of Eversea.  Whew!<br />The interpersonal relationships are developed further - the bittersweet love between Sareth and Lirith, and the dilemma faced by Beltan and Vani.  Ayrn is forced to face the results of her past actions, and her response determines the course of her future.  Grace is still slowly rediscovering her emotional responses after facing the horrifying memories of her childhood, and is allowing herself to open to others.  Sides are taken by the Witches and the Warriors of Vathris regarding the foretold coming of the Runebreaker, resulting in conflicting feelings in their individual members.<br />I am truly enjoying this series.  The characters are complex, distinctive and plentiful.  Since the characters are constantly traveling, the world of Eldh is being fully explored, including its various ethnic groups and belief systems.  I like the interplay with Earth and Eldh, with their similarities and differences, and the bond between the two universes that is gradually getting tighter and tighter.  I will definitely be getting whatever further books are issued in this series.resulting in conflicting feelings in their individual members.<br />I am truly enjoying this series.

It's witty, wry, droll, sexy and just plain funny.  It was just pure fun to listen to Gabe and Riley slip and slide their way out of tricky emotionally-charged conversations.  Riley's comments about \\"the blonde\\" were priceless.  I also liked the fact that Nell and Gabe both were strong-willed individuals and that they clashed and didn't back down.  The other characters - Riley, Suze, Chloe, Margie, Jase, Lu and even Jack - had unexpected depth.<br />The main setting is a detective agency, where Gabe and Riley McKenna are the partners and operators.  As a favor to one of their main clients, Jack Dysart, Gabe hires Jack's ex-sister-in-law, Nell Dysart, as a temporary secretary.  Initially, Gabe can't decide if Nell is the best secretary that they've ever had, or the office-manager-from-Hell.  Nell also happens to be the best friend of Suze Dysart, Jack's wife and, unknown to her, the unrequited love of Riley's life.  Added to the mix is Chloe, Gabe's ex-wife who divorced him ten years ago but with whom he still sleeps with on occasion; Margie Dysart, Nell & Suze's sister-in-law whose husband disappeared seven years ago after an embezzlement charge; Trevor Oglivie, Margie's father and Jack's partner, and the person who drove Margie's mother to what appears to be suicide.  Add to the mix a blackmailer, an arsonist, and a couple of dead bodies and you have a tangled mix of mystery and romance.<br />Some reviewers have had some complaints about the number of characters and romances in the book, but I didn't have any problem with that.  Each relationship was totally different but each explored the ways a woman reacts to the demands of a relationship in terms of her own individuality and needs.  I didn't have any problem keeping track of what what going on with the mystery or who the main players were.<br />If you've enjoyed Jennifer Crusie's other books, you will definitely enjoy this one.

It's a great introduction to the alternate history/fantasy genre that combines the familiar aspects of Regency society with the imaginative what-if's of a world where the American Revolutionary War never happened.<br />It tells the story of Sarah Cunningham, an American from Baltimore, who in 1805 is on her way to England.  Unbeknownst to her, in an alternate dimension, her exact physical counterpart, Sarah the Marchioness of Roxbury, is about to die, leaving an important promise unfulfilled.  Servants who are practioners of the magical arts manage to switch the Sarahs' personalities at the moment of the Marchioness' death.  An added twist is that Roxbury has for years been betrothed (though not in love with) the Duke of Wessex, who is secretly a spy for the King.<br />This all takes place in an England where the Stuarts still retain the throne, and King George never existed.  It is also a world where the American colonies are still proud parts of the English empire, the Louisiana Purchase never happened, the faerie's existence is acknowledged, and John Adams is an English ambassador.  It's an excellent blend of the familiar and the unknown, of missing heirs, magic, treason, history, romance, treachery, and adventure.<br />For Regency fans, this gives you a taste of a new genre, that has a whole new world of reading possibilities.  For alternate history fans, the depiction of Regency society explains why that genre is so beloved by its fans.  This is a book that is the best of both worlds.	2002-04-21

This book picks up where the second left off.  Hannah and David Hendrickson had been about to (finally!) consumate their relationship when his parents unexpectedly turned up, interrupting the moment.  It had taken a while for Hannah to get to that point, since she has issues with the fact that David is seven years younger than she is (she's about age 43 at the time of this story).<br />All that, however, becomes secondary to the main plot, which is the arrival of the circus in town, and its magician, a man who claims to be Hannah's father.  Hannah's childhood had been a rocky one, and she isn't prepared to just welcome Daddy back with open arms.  Of course, all isn't sweetness and light at the circus either, and needless to say, a murder occurs and the magician appears to be the culprit.<br />I thought that by the third book I might begin to get tired of Sarah's cohorts, a band of intrepid yet busybody seniors, but I actually liked them more in this book.  Their personalities are differentiated better, I guess, and it's obvious that their actions are motivated on a large part by affection for Hannah.  The romance between Hannah and David continues to perk along, becoming more sexually charged as time passes.  One of the best parts of the romance is that he is rock-sure of his feelings toward her, which is a nice change of pace for a male lead character.<br />All in all, this is a great continuation of the series, and I'm looking forward to the next book.	2002-04-21

Although the bare bones plot sounds absurd - a 35 year old high school English teacher is transported into an alternate dimension where she unwillingly takes the place of a High Priestess and is forced to wed a Centaur, and then fight a battle against unrelenting Evil - this book was entertaining, well-written, witty, romantic, and often hilarious.  The most important thing, though, is that the characters were realistic and true to themselves, no matter what form they took, and despite what might appear to be an absurd situation.  So much so that by the end of the book, the reader totally accepts the premise and buys into the world that was created.<br />Shannon Parker is the teacher we all would be if we could: never overwhelmed by classroom problems/behaviors, taking perverse satisfaction in giving out tests to high schoolers and enjoying their dismay, and living for summer vacation.  In her role as the High Priestess, she carries on as she normally would, using the skills that teaching a bunch of 16 year olds has taught her.  Her relationship with her Centaur husband, ClanFintan, answers all those questions a reader might have asked about certain physical aspects of things.

US	52593236	R183FYJO7ZAPTE	0451456661	401942092	Son of Darkness	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Great Beginning, Now Let's Have A Sequel	Although all of the favorable reviewers seem to agree that this book begs a sequel, it isn't dependent upon one because the conflict is resolved by the end of the story.  It's just that the two main characters, Denise Sheridan and Ilaron Highborn, have finally become a team by the end of the book, and the reader just wants to see more of them.<br />This book provided an interesting view of the Unseelie court of Faerie, somewhat different than that of Laurell K. Hamilton or Emma Bull.  This is a place of no sun, no joy, no love.  Pain and torture are everyday occurances and advancement within the society is through assasination.  There is no such thing as family loyalty.  It is a much darker and bleaker place than other depictions.<br />Ilaron Highborn is considered to be a heretic within that culture because he has decided to turn away from the Darkness.  Even though he renounced his claims to the Unseelie throne, no one believes him because no one tells the truth there.  He escapes to the human realm and sets himself up as an art dealer.  Ms. Sherman has created an interesting character in Ilaron, and fleshes him out by explaining the adaptations he's had to make to deal with exposure to the sun and the ever-present iron, which is deadly to the Faerie.  Denise Sheridan is a curator of Mesopotamian art at a NYC museum, which is a thinly disguised copy of the Metropolitan.  She is an annoyance to the museum director who considers her department not flashy enough to bring in the crowds and the money.  Her work brings her into contact with Ilaron, and her historical expertise ultimately puts her in jeopardy.<br />While this isn't a romance, per se, there is a growing relationship between Ilaron and Denise based upon two rather lonely people from totally different cultures coming to understand and appreciate the other.  Of course, this being an urban fantasy, there other beings involved - the ruler of the Unseelie who is trying to destroy Ilaron, a group of cultists who want to kill Denise, and a released Assyrian/Babylonian Demon of Disease who is set loose in NYC and wants to destroy Denise because she has the knowledge to banish it.  Innocents and not-so-innocents are harmed, battles occur, and ultimately one side triumphs.  I really enjoyed this book and hope that someday there'll be a sequel.want to kill Denise, and a released Assyrian/Babylonian Demon of Disease who is set loose in NYC and wants to destroy Denise because she has the knowledge to banish it.

She is an ex-cop, a cop's widow, and the partner in a home/business security firm with another ex-cop.  She's not a lighthearted, wisecracking heroine.  She's had a lot of pain in her life and it has scarred her.  Her partner disappears, possibly due to what looks like involvement with police corruption, and she becomes a suspect.  The story chronicles her ever-changing role in the investigation and her dealings with the complex personalities involved.<br />What intrigued me by this book, as I got further and further into it was that my impression of Meg Gillis was being built up by her words and actions, not by an author-provided description of her looks or her setting.  It seemed to me that Ms. Songer really managed to describe the mindset of an ex-cop, one who views the world from the feminine perspective rather than the masculine, but who is forced deal with the masculine preconceptions of the cop's world.<br />The writing style in this book is spare and to the point.  You have to pay attention to the nuances of the characters.  This serves to create tension nicely and forces you to try to puzzle out what is exactly going on, and who, if anyone, Meg can trust.  There are a lot of twists and turns in this story, and the pace is maintained throughout the book.  This was a good debut novel about an interesting character, and I'm looking forward to reading the second book in the series.	2002-04-17

The society has become industrialized, and a surpressed dissident cult exists which believes that the god Jovah is actually an orbiting spaceship, and that proof of this was found in years past by the Angel Alleluia and later surpressed.  Just to clarify things, although angels are main characters in these stories, they are not the heavenly, chubby-cheeked cherubim of greeting cards.  They are flesh and blood beings, with all the foibles of humanity.<br />Samarian society appears to be slowly coming full circle, from what the original settlers envisioned, to that which the settlers originally escaped.  Power within the society is shifting away from the angels, and the Archangel appears to be pursuing an agenda of his own which appears to be in direct conflict with his predestined role within that society.<br />This book tells the story of Tamar, a dedicated cultist, and the angel Jared who become uneasy allies in the search for Alleluia's truths.  The Samarian society is once again richly detailed, and if you've been reading the series from the beginning you'll recognize the changes in lifestyle and attitudes that have taken place since the first book.  Tamar and Jared are interesting, well-developed characters, initially mistrusting each other, but then coming to accept that their meeting was predestined by Jovah.	2002-04-17

I guess I'm one of the few people who is enjoying this series more with each book.  I liked this book just as much as the first two.  I like the fact that the author is able to juggle a number of subplots and keep them all interesting, whether they're occurring on Earth involving the Seekers and Duratek, or on the alternate world named Eldh involving gods, myths and magic.<br />I have no problem with the increasing number of characters in the book, in fact I think it adds to the story since each character brings something unique into the mix.  Mr. Anthony has managed to give us some essential scenes with each of the characters, revealing some of their motivations and secrets, making them that much more real.  All are essential to the plot.  It's interesting to see how the friendships are growing and the romantic interests are weaving together.  In each book, the characters have been evolving and deepening.  Some reviewers seem to have a problem with the way some of the relationships appear to be developing, but to me, the characters have become so familiar and so real that their yearnings and growing awareness are all the more poignant.  How can you not wish them well?<br />In this third book of the series, Travis and Grace return to Earth to seek medical care for the gravely wounded knight, Beltan.  However, while there, the evil Duratek Corporation (who are planning to rape the ecological resources of the world Eldh) have managed to locate them due to the betrayal of a friend, have captured Beltan, and plan to conduct medical experiments on him.  Travis and Grace are forced to turn to the Seekers for assistance.  Meanwhile, back on Eldh, Melia, Falken and the others travel to the fabled city of Tarras to find out who is killing the New Gods.  Grace and Travis are finally forced to come to terms with the shadows of their pasts that have haunted them all of their lives.  This, of course, is a great simplification of the plot, which has many more twists and turns, trials and tribulations.  It is a fast-moving, interesting, and enjoyable story, and I for one am looking forward to Book Four.trials and tribulations.

So far, I haven't read a book by Tanya Huff that I haven't enjoyed, and this collection is no exception.  It contains 15 of her short stories, and there's not a bad one in the bunch.  Best of all, it contains four short stories involving her Blood series characters Vicki Nelson, Michael Celluci and Henry Fitzroy - always a pleasure to read.<br />\\"The Chase Is On\\" is a space opera, whose characters deserve a book of their own.  \\"Underground\\" tells the story of what may exist in the Toronto subway system.  \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\" is about a mother, her young daughter, and the inheritance that is much more than it appears to be.  \\"Shin Li-Ung\\" is a story about Chinese tradition, gangs, and unexpected protection.  \\"First Love, Last Love\\" is the ultimate tale of boys and their toys.  \\"Word of Honor\\" tells of a woman who discovers her own honor while carrying out a quest for someone else.  \\"The Harder They Fall\\" is about what happens when fairy tales turn real.  \\"A Debt Unpaid\\" is a mining story involving personal choices and personal ghosts.  \\"February Thaw\\" takes the story of Demeter, Persephone, and Hades and turns them into a modern-day dysfunctional family.  \\"Symbols Are A Percussion Instrument\\" involves an cynic and a pack of tarot cards.  \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream Team\\" takes High Elves and crosses them with the Olympics.  And then \\"This Town Ain't Big Enough\\", What Manner of Man\\", \\"The Cards Also Say\\" and \\"The Vengeful Spirit of Lake Nepeakea\\" all continue the story of Vicki Nelson (ex-cop, now a vampire PI), her lover Detective-Sargeant Michael Celluci, and Henry Fitzroy (romantic novelist, vampire, and bastard son of King Henry VIII of England).<br />If you've never read Ms. Huff, this is a great introduction to her writing.  And if you're a fan, then this is icing on the cake.	2002-03-01

The fantasy premise seemed funny to me: an alien (Sub-Commander Ur Targon) transporting to Earth is mistakenly inserted into a woman's (Maryellen) body, and she tries to figure out if she's having a mental breakdown or if he really exists.  I could think of a lot of directions this story might have taken, but unfortunately for me, the author took a completely different route.<br />This book is written as an extreme, and I mean extreme, screwball comedy.  The story went from amusing to silly to just plain boring after a while.  There was just too much going on and amusing sequences that should have been isolated events became  whole subplots.  In addition to silliness like having Targon get drunk while Maryellen is dining at 21 in NYC, she winds up dancing and singing in NYC traffic.  Her sister (the former fashion model who resembles Jerry Hall) is married to a multimillionaire named Crump and they live in Crump Tower.  Yeah, right.  She goes to a trendy psychiatrist who behaves in a totally unprofessional manner and is actually an alien cult groupie.  He refers her for some group therapy, but the group is actually the cult.  For some reason this cult is made up of a lot of Trekkies, behaving in a totally non-Trek-like fashion.  There is a long treatise on Area 51 which was totally unnecessary.  Targon manifests himself to the group, so now of course, we now have a whole subplot of the cult trying to capture him.  Targon and Maryellen are constantly on the run with many supposedly wacky things happening to them.  On top of all this, we have the government involved, specifically the FBI, in the person of Wolf Madder, a Fox Mulder [take off]..<br />You get the picture.  Maybe someone else would find this all amusing, but I didn't.  The characters were shallow and comic-bookish, and the book failed in its primary goal of engaging the reader, namely me.  This book just tries to hard to be hilarious, but sadly doesn't suceed.  I'm sorry that I bought it.y that I bought it.	2002-03-01

Okay, so we've got two gorgeous, identical twin brothers, both of whom are immortal and both who take their sustenance form humans.  But are these regular vampires who take the blood of their victims?  No, these guys enter other people's dreams (always females, of course), manipulate the dreams to give them an erotic content, and then skim off the person's excess \\"life force\\" - some sort of mystical hoodoo.  Naturally, one twin longs for mortality while the other revels in his immortality.  And, as you must have suspected by now, Twin A finds the woman who can make him mortal, while Twin B tries to do everything in his power to stop him.<br />See how quickly I told you the plot?  It took the author 425 pages.  Of course, Twin A never admits to the woman who is his salvation that he has a twin, so we have the whole mistaken identity scenario going on, not to mention the endless, boring dream sequences.  (I don't think that I can forgive this author for the cliche of having one of her heroine's favorite fantasies being riding a wild horse on a beach.)  The characters are poorly developed - we are given just bits and pieces of the heroine's past (the older sister who was driven to suicide by the loss of her lover, the cousin with the troubled past, the death of her parents), as if that should explain her rather unprofessional (she's a psychologist) and erratic behavior.  I was sorely disappointed with this book.	2002-02-22

It's almost like an updated Frank Capra movie, with the bewildered but persevering male and an eccentric heiress, only without those things that normally make you cringe when you see one of those movies.  This time the guy is an intelligent, quick-thinking corporate type, not the usual bumbler.<br />The story is basically told from Pendleton's perspective, a South Jersey guy who has returned to the high-power corporate world, this time in Louisville KY, and gets involved with the dysfunctional McClellan family, wealthy distillers of high quality bourbon.  He's trying to prove to himself and his soon-to-be-remarried ex-wife that he's still got what it takes to make it in that world.  He soon realizes that the main reason he was hired, however, was to be a prospective suitor for the only McClellan daughter (Kit McClellan).  It seems her mother's will stated that she had to be married within two years of the mother's death, otherwise her estate of $99.4 million will go to charity.  Unfortunately for the McClellan males who have disrupted every romance that Kit has ever had, it's now payback time as far as she's concerned.<br />Ms. Bevarly writes witty dialogue and plays on words beautifully.  She makes you smile with her turn of phrase.  Pendleton was a joy, just watching him play corporate-speak while his mind was wandering to other areas was hilarious.  And Kit, for all her apparent eccentric behavior, had a perfectly good reason for it and was ultimately a sympathetic character.  Their romance was was a well-written tug of wills and emotions.  There was also a nice secondary romance involving one of Kit's brothers, a recovering alcoholic, and a woman involved with the Temperance League, who herself is the widow of an alcoholic.	2002-02-20

Our hero's sisters have arranged for their regimented, in-a-rut older brother to be taken there for an enforced two week vacation.  Without his electronics and his routine, he is lost and is *not* a happy camper.  Soon though, his long-dormant instincts revive, much to his chagrin.  This fish-out-of-water story humorously tells of one man's return to life and the unlikely woman who instigates it.  It's an amusing, romantic and well-written tale.<br />A working ranch in Montana is the setting for Molly O'Keefe's story about a social worker from Los Angeles who brings a South Central gang wannabe there for a summer out of his normal enviroment.  This program is her brain child and she's determined for it to succeed.  Little does she know that she'll be the one seduced by the ranch and its inhabitants, specifically its emotionally scarred foreman.  The main characters had emotional depth and the secondary characters were nicely developed.  The humor, sexual attraction and romance were well done.  This is apparently Ms. O'Keefe's first book and it is an excellent beginning.  Here's hoping she keeps on writing and gives us more stories about the Cook family of Montana!	2002-01-27

The men initially have nothing in common except for a basic dissatisfaction/disillusionment about the course of their lives.  The trader is a widower who has never really gotten over his wife's senseless death; the trucker is trying to get in touch with an unforgettable woman with whom he had a one-night stand; the cop is trying to fight to prevent his son's stepfather from adopting him.  Each one eventually travels out to the ranch for his own reasons - the trader to check out the investment and his plans to subdivide the property, the trucker to heal after his injuries, and the divorced cop to rebuild his relationship with his son.<br />Needless to say, each man finds more than he bargained for, both in personal growth and in love.  All learn that the true value of the ranch is not necessarily counted in monetary terms.  Running through all three stories is a mystery about sabotage that is occuring on the ranch, which is ultimately solved in the final story.<br />The stories were interesting because a good portion of them were told from the male viewpoint, which was a nice change of pace.  All of the characters appear in each other's stories to one degree or another.  Ms. Thompson's stories are always tightly written with good dialogue, scenes and characters, and this one was no exception.  The romances were all different, and while the sexual encounters were not as explicit as in some of her other books, the sexual tension was nicely done.  The location descriptions made the ranch seem real.  At 664 pages, this was a great book to spend a day with.	2002-01-27

A small town in Montana decides to help out a neighbor whose ranch is about to go into foreclosure by holding an auction of artwork by local artists, services by local businesses, and dates with local bachelors.  The twist in this story is that one of the foster children raised on that ranch is now an extremely  famous movie actor, Sloan Gallagher (who seems to be a actor in the Harrison Ford mold).  After a call from an old buddy, Sloan agrees to be one of the items in the auction.  Naturally, his involvement in the auction turns it into a national three-ring circus, with fans, groupies, and the news media descending on the unprepared town of Elmer MT.<br />Polly McMaster is the mayor, the postmaster, and a widowed mother of four in the town of Elmer.  She's been picked to organize the auction and adds it to the many other duties that she has.  She's a woman who's pulled in many directions but seems to be able to handle what comes along (with the exception of forgetting a child here or an appointment there).  She's also a woman who hasn't taken an interest in other men since her husband, her soulmate and best friend, was killed in an airplane crash 6 years ago.  That's about to change, big time.<br />Sloan and Polly have a history, but it was more on his part than hers - she is his \\"golden memory\\" of something he saw when he was 14.  She's always been the standard that he's compared the other women in his life.  When he finds out that Polly has been widowed, he's determined to renew their acquaintance and find out if his memory has held true.<br />This was a thoroughly enjoyable story, with multiple subplots.  I've never read anything by this author, but from the number of people mentioned in the book, I got the impression that there are other books out there telling their stories.  The characters, their actions, and their emotions were believable.  The children in the story were realistic, without being cloying or wiser than their years.  The scene with Sloan sharing a bedroom with a 9 year old beautifully captured the child's thrill of being in the presence of his movie hero, and the frustration of an adult male sleeping in a bottom bunk when there was someplace else he'd much rather be.  There are multiple romances in the book - tender, wishful, unrequited, and sexy.  Sloan and Polly's developing romance was filled with aggravation, humor and sexual tension.  This is one of those books that once you read it, you want more, to find out the full stories of the other characters that were mentioned.

What's not to like with that, especially since the story is punctuated with tabloid story titles highlighting important scenes.  This is a quick and interesting read.  I think that I'd cut the character of Cat a little more slack than some of the other reviewers because, when you think about it, she found herself in some really weird circumstances.  Some readers might be bothered by the graphic violence and incestuous relationships (but hey, they're lycanthropes not humans).  My problem with this book was the ending.  Throughout the whole book, Lucius seems to have some sort of mystical connection with Cat, saving her and pursuing her.  The basis for this is never really explained, but it had to be more than her being a you-know-what in heat (which I'm just surmising here, because that was never mentioned).  Yet at the end of the book his personality changes completely, and I don't think that the character development that led up to this justifies it.  Here's hoping there'll be a sequel (since threads were definitely left hanging) that'll resolve some of my questions.  Even having said all this, if you're a werewolf/paranormal genre fan, this book is definitely worth reading.	2002-01-21

(My mental image was initially of Jimmy Buffett in judge's robes.)  But it turns out that Whit Mosely is an honorable and compassionate man, and may just be the perfect choice for his job.<br />He's close to the end of a reelection campaign when an old acquaintance, Pete Hubble, is found murdered.  Unfortunately, it turns out that Pete is the estranged son of a Senator (who is also up for reelection) and he also just happens to be a well-known porn star (under an assumed name).  To complicate matters further, Whit is the lover of Pete's ex-wife, who is in charge of the Senator's election campaign.  Unbeknownst to the local law officials, they also have a serial killer in their midst.  Also thrown into this mix is Claudia Salazar, a very recently divorced dectective, who is forced to work on a missing persons case with her ex-husband; a runaway barely-legal female who knows more than she's telling; Pete's porn movie producer/lover who's looking for justice; and Whit's own extended family consisting of his five brothers (the notorious Mosley boys), his alcoholic father and the father's fourth wife who is 25 years old and to whom Whit feels a distinct non-filial attraction.<br />There's a multitude of plot twists and turns, family secrets revealed, betrayals and the like.  It was a nice little rollercoaster ride, and I'm looking forward to more books in this series.	2002-01-17

Ms. Sizemore has created a nice space opera with interesting species, interstellar wars, treachery, telepaths, semi-immortals, romance, plague, group marriage, addiction, death-cults, and much more.  If you're a hard-core sci-fi reader there should be plenty here for you.  If you're new to the genre, or if you are a romance fan, the behavior and relationships of the characters should provide a familiar basis for your introduction to this type of story.<br />Roxanne Shirah Merkrates is a Physician in the United Systems Military system.  She is also of the Koltiri race and Shirah family, which means she is a powerful empath/telepath.  She's contractually married to the captain of her ship, Eamon Merkrates.  A plague is rapidly decimating planets, and she is sent by the Systems Council, to Eamon's displeasure, on a mercy mission to try to find a cure for the plague.  The hospital she's sent to come under attack, she escapes in a dealer's ship, is captured by slavers, and then by pirates.<br />Pyr is the captain of the pirate ship, a being who has been already infected by the plague, is addicted to the contraband medicine that staves it off, and was recently bitten by an acolyte of a death cult which infected him with a slow-acting fatal poison.  He is trying to maintain control over his ship without letting his shipmates know that he is dying.  He is also pursuing his own secret agenda regarding his People, the plague and his missing crewman, Axylel.<br />Needless to say, the meeting of Roxanne and Pyr complicates their lives in an unexpected way, resulting in a bond that is stronger than either of them anticipated.  This was a story that held my interest throughout - it flowed nicely, the primary and secondary characters were nicely developed, and most importantly, it didn't bog down the reader with unnessary technobits that weren't essential to the story.	2002-01-17

This one takes place in Fossil Washington, and concerns the murder of Crystal Davis, the owner of the Baker Street Honky Tonk, her late father's tavern.  The whodunnit itself wasn't that complex, since the reader is quickly able to eliminate most of the possible suspects, but it serves to provide the framework for the meeting between Crystal's sister, Veronica Davis who is a restoration specialist, and Cooper Blackstock, an ex-Marine of mysterious means and also the man hired to run the tavern.  Their working relationship and developing romance is the main focus of the story.<br />Veronica and Cooper are both running from their past, yet both wind up in the town where they've been hurt the most.  Each has unresolved issues with their deceased parents, issues which molded both of them and which also serve as a stumbling block to their growing attraction to one another.  There is also the complication of Crystal's young daughter Lizzy - she's now motherless, her father has been charged with the murder, and now he's jumped bail.  Adding to all that is the fact that Veronica now has to deal with settling Crystal's affairs, providing a stable homelife for her niece, and temporarily help out waitressing at the tavern (putting her in close proximity to Cooper, but also bringing back unpleasant memories of her teenage years).  To make matters worse, Lizzy's father, Eddie Chapman, is also Cooper's half-brother, a fact which he has omitted telling Veronica.  There is also a nicely done secondary romance between Veronica's best friend Marissa, a widowed mother of three, and a local businessman named Kody, who is afraid to commit.<br />This story was a bit more serious in tone than some of Ms. Andersen's other books due to the issues raised, but it still contains her excellent dialogue, amusing scenes, and fine character development.  Unlike some authors, all of her main characters seem real, their behaviors true.  They don't make the reader cringe in disbelief.  The children in the story are real children, not discardable plot devices, but kids you could easily take to your heart.

I was surprised that Ms. Thompson made her such a stereotypical Kansas-hayseed-coming-to-the-Big-City character.  It just didn't ring true, and her behavior was inconsistent.  She's a gosh-golly type about being in New York City (shades of &quot;That Girl&quot; and &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;), yet her sole goal in being there seems to be to have sex with as many men as possible.  She'd apparently &quot;sampled&quot; everyone her small town had to offer.  She's saved money for years to go to NYC but there's no indication that she wants to expand herself culturally - just sexually.  She's in her mid-twenties, yet her mental attitude towards sex seems to be about age sixteen with no thought of STD or the potential dangers of unknown partners.  But, when the story wasn't focusing on her background, her personality seemed to mature.  As I mentioned, inconsistent.<br />I realize that this book was released under the Harlequin Blaze imprint, with all that implies, but there didn't seem to be any problem with the other characters being well-developed and more believable in their behavior.  The other characters and the story itself balanced out my annoyance with Trudy, so in the end, I can say that I did enjoy the book.  The story itself had some interesting issues concerning families, love, and overcoming conditioning.  The romance was sweet - it was one of those &quot;two people who want nothing to do with marriage unwillingly falling in love&quot; types.  The secondary characters added depth to the story.  The sexual situations were graphic, inventive and plentiful.  If you like reading about sexual fantasy fulfillment, then this book is for you.  Ms. Thompson doesn't dissolve the story into euphemisms at key moments, and she wasn't adverse to settting some of the sexual encounters in out-of-the-ordinary places.	2002-01-13

To answer the previous reviewers' question, the author's real name is Sonja Massie, and she's written other books under that name.<br />I really enjoyed this debut of the character Savannah Reid.  In this book she's introduced as a police detective in her forties (a nice change of pace) who gets chosen to head up the investigation into a city councilwoman's husband's death.  It is a powderkeg, and unfortunately for Savannah, she does her job too well, much to the dismay of the powers-that-be.  The price she pays for her tenacity is the loss of her job on a trumped-up rules violation.  Needless to say, when she is asked to continue investigating the case by the person who is the prime suspect, Savannah agrees.  On top of all this, her very naive yet stubborn teenage sister arrives unexpectedly from Georgia, announces that she is going to stay with Savannah permanently, and promptly becomes involved with an older man well-known to the local police dept.<br />Savannah is interesting, independent character.  She seems to be comfortable with herself, and isn't afraid to go after what she wants.  Ms. McKevett has also created a nice assortment of secondary characters with their own quirks and flaws.  The mystery had some nice twists and turns.  I'm looking forward to the rest of the books in the series.	2002-01-10

This should actually be a 3 1/2 star rating.<br />Being non-Wiccan, I just read this story as a mystery not as a potential introduction to a new religion.  I have to agree with a previous reviewer who said that Ms. Ravenwolf was ill-served by her publishing house regarding the editing of this book.  Some words were simply in the wrong place, and then there's that whole scene at the end where Tanner throws down the golden pitchfork in the town, and then it miraculously appears in his hands when he goes to save Siren (no magick involved - just bad editing).<br />I have to say, though, that I did enjoy the book.  I wasn't looking for great literature and I'll cut authors a lot of slack in my ratings if the book intrigues me, and this one did.  There were a lot of interesting characters, some sterotypical and some not, but at least there were plenty to keep it interesting.  I think Ms. Ravenwolf managed to get across the feeling of the time and place - both the gloriousness and dreariness of autumn in Pennsylvania.  Siren's awakening to her &quot;calling&quot; was interesting.  I liked the main characters, though I think that more could have been done to give them more depth rather than just labelling them (&quot;murderess&quot;, &quot;drunk&quot;, &quot;jilted husband&quot;, etc.).  I would have liked a little more in-depth discussion of motivations - what caused the evil three to come up with their plan, why did Siren take the life path she did (and what actually did happen in her childhood to make her block out meeting Tanner earlier), why was it so important for Tanner to appear &quot;normal&quot; in a community with a long history of witchcraft?<br />For those of you who may be hesitant for religious reasons about reading fiction by an avowed practioner of the Craft, be easy and read this book.  It was an interesting and painless introduction to another belief system and a pretty good mystery.  Your own beliefs will remain intact.	2002-01-08
US	52593236	R1FUYWESFCVYUG	0440237149	759067388	Heaven on Earth	Books	5	6	7	N	N	The Bethlehem NY saga continues...	When we last left our heroes:  Private eye Melina Dimitris had just had a four-day torrid romance with cabinet maker Sebastian Knight who had cowardly and unceremoniously dumped her - Southern former bad boy Ben Foster (who had fallen in love with Melina's friend Lynda Barone) had just revealed to Alanna Dalton that he was her long-missing father - Alanna had difficulty accepting it and decided to run away to Providence to seek out the mother that had abandoned her for a life of drugs - to protect her, her friend Caleb Brown came along, and unbeknownst to them, 7 year old Chrissy Knight decided to tag along to find *her* missing mother.<br />Whew!  And that only touches on the multitude of storylines in Ms. Pappano's ongoing series about the people of Bethlehem NY - a comfortable and homely town, where the complicated romantic lives of its citizens get occasional assistance from a group of guardian angels.  This is a throughly engrossing series, though each book is capable of being a stand-alone romance novel.<br />This book primarily focuses on the sexual explosion that briefly occured between Melina and Sebastian - its effects on their lives and its fallout - and hunt for the three missing children.  Melina is a strong, successful, gorgeous, independent and unabashedly sexual woman from a tightknit Greek family.  She owns and operates what she calls the best detective agency in New York.  She enjoys men and sex, and isn't afraid to be upfront about it.  Sebastian is a handsome, lonely, divorced dad who's basically isolated himself from the world for the last four years after his wife of 11 years just left him one day without an explanation, leaving their small daughter in his care.  His brief affair with Melina threatened to upset the order of his life and his ongoing mourning of his marriage's dissolution, and he broke it off abruptly.<br />When the kids go missing, Lynda and Ben (afraid that his revelation was what caused Alanna to run away) call Melina and asks her to try to find the the children, since the police are limited in what they can do.  Sebastian, almost beside himself with worry and guilt, manages to tag along with Melina on her search.  The book traces the children's search for their missing mothers, introduces a 17 year old runaway who befriends them, and explores the continuing attraction between Melina and Sebastian despite their differing attitudes and emotional scars.<br />Even without reading the other books, it's easy to pick up the threads of the various past and current storylines, and Ms. Pappano helps out things further by providing a list of characters at the beginning of this book.  All of her novels that I've read so far are well-written and engrossing.  Her characters are very believable, as are their behaviors.  The guardian angel bit is never overdone or obnoxious.  The romances are sexy, and while never following a straight path, always wind up where they should.

US	52593236	RM0NDA3QF9FCA	0515131733	800958503	The Winston Brothers	Books	5	89	91	N	N	Perfect Brain Candy	This book combines the stories of three of the four Winston brothers of Thomasvillle KY, which were previously published in novella format in other anthologies (&quot;Hot Chocolate&quot;, &quot;Charmed&quot; and &quot;Sinful&quot;).<br />Cole is the eldest.  He operates the Winston Tavern which provided the main source of income for him to raise his brothers after their parents died young.  For seven months, Sophie (a neighboring boutique owner) has been stopping by after work for a hot chocolate.  He's been growing more and more attracted to her, but she doesn't seem to notice.  She, on the other hand, has been attracted to him from the start, but becomes shy in his presence.  She's a lonely woman who finally decides to take matters into her own hands and change her life.<br />Chase Winston tends the bar at the tavern.  He's known as the quiet one.  For some reason, one night he begins to &quot;hear&quot; Allison's erotic thoughts about him, and realizes that she might be agreeable to his rather unusual sexual predilictions.  He pursues her, not realizing that she has her own agenda - one that involves a haunted house and a missing treasure.<br />Mack Winston has achieved his dream of becoming a teacher and is waiting for a permanent assignment.  Sophie and Allison convince him to act as a male model for a photo shoot of the men's intimate apparel that they plan to feature in Sophie's boutique's catalogue.  The photographer just happens to be the woman he's desired ever since college.  She always ignored his advances there despite her attraction - he was years younger and she always viewed him as an irresponsible college stud.  He sets out to change her opinion.<br />The stories are all well-written, with realistic characters, beautiful romances, good dialogue, high sexual tension, and graphic sex.  The brothers' relationship was enjoyable and amusing.  This book was a pleasant way to spend a few hours.  I'm looking forward to future books about other Winston men..	2002-01-05

I like the fact that Jennifer Marsh was an *unpublished* author, rather than the typical successful author pursuing mysteries in his/her spare time.  It was also nice to see the workings of a reading group.  So often authors thank their reading groups on their dedication pages, and I always wondered exactly what the group did for them.  Now I know.<br />The plot seemed a little silly at the start, what with Jennifer setting herself up as a murderess in order to gain publicity.  It seemed to me that she had to be on the verge of madness to let things go as far as it did, and I found that to be unsettling.  Who sends out threatening letters on their own letterhead?  She is supposed to be knowledgeable about crime but doesn't know about current stalking and harassment laws?  Perhaps it was supposed to be funny, but it didn't make sense character-wise, especially since the opening pages mentioned that she was a &quot;good Baptist girl&quot;.  That's really my only quibble with the book but it was a big one, dropping the rating from four to three stars.<br />Contrary to the other reviewers' opinions, I found Jennifer's mental conversations with her unfertilized egg, which she named Jaimie (being a non-gender-specific name) really funny, especially when she felt that Jaimie was putting pressure on her to hurry up and choose it a daddy.  All of the secondary characters were nicely drawn, each with a distinctive character, and her potential love interest was suitably gorgeous.  I'll definitely continue reading this series.	2002-01-05

He's returned to take up his inheritance - an apple orchard in Vermont.  He has plans to turn it into a serious organic business, but in the town's eyes, he's still the same troublemaking stud he used to be, and the bank won't take him seriously for a loan.  To change his image, he decides to hire a wife for six months, to give the illusion of stability and hopefull get the business loan.  He hires Maggie Toone in New Jersey and brings her to his farm.  She's eager to escape her small town life and job as a teacher, and relishes the chance to fulfill her dream of writing a book based upon her aunt's diaries.  One small problem - her aunt was the local madam.<br />This is a very funny and witty book.  Hank and Maggie's relationship is romantic and sexy.  The dialogue is classic Evanovich - she easily writes in the rhythm of natural speech so the reader feels as though he/she could step right into the conversation.  Hank falls in love with Maggie right off the bat and plots to make their marriage a real one; she is not so sure that she wants to be stuck in another small town.  Elsie Hawkins, a reoccuring character in Ms. Evanovich's romances, is present here as a temporary housekeeper.  She is the prototype of the Grandma Mazur character of the Stephanie Plum series - a feisty, blunt-speaking senior who drives a '57 Cadillac, packs a gun, and is in serious pursuit of the male species (in her age group, they tend to drop dead unexpectedly so she tries to act quickly).<br />Hopefully, someday these early Evanovich books will be reissued, but until then, this definitely one used-book worth finding.	2002-01-03

She's returned to Mississippi to try to save the old family plantation, but without success.  Her only companion in the big old house is the ghost of her great-great-grandmother's nanny, Jitty.  Jitty is a kick, and the bane of Sarah Booth's existence, though of course, only Sarah Booth can see her.  Another complication is the Delaney women's penchants for madness and mysterious &quot;womb&quot; disorders - which can be interpreted anyway you like - and which seem to be well-known in the community.  Know only that Sarah Booth's biological clock is ticking very loudly.<br />Sarah Booth decides on dognapping as the quickest way to raise money, holding her best friend's dog for ransom.  Problems ensue when this same friend asks her to investigate an older murder, stirring up things that probably should have been best be left alone.  There's also the complication of her attraction to two different men - one who wants to marry her and get her out of her financial difficulties, and one who may have been a murderer and seems to be just passing through her life.<br />This was a very enjoyable book - well-written, sexy, and funny.  The Deep South setting is interesting, and Ms. Haines describes that society with amusement and affection, and makes it an integral part of the story.  If you're a fan of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series, you'll like this book.  The storylines and characters are different but there are some basic similarities - an amusing woman who thinks she sees herself clearly yet who can't really understand her own appeal, a surfeit of handsome and sexy men, and uniquely amusing secondary characters.	2002-01-03

This is, I believe, the fourth book in the series, and things are starting to get monotonous.  It's a given that all of the male leads are going to be strong, handsome, powerful, protective, and somewhat tortured.  All of the females have turned out to be petite, beautiful, full-breasted, resentful and independent.  First we had a raven-haired beauty, then a redhead, then a blonde, and now we're back to a raven-haired beauty.  You get the picture.<br />I had hopes for this book, since it tells the story of Gregori, &quot;The Dark One&quot;.  He's the Carpathian who's been mentioned in all of the previous books in a hushed voice - he's the most powerful of them all.  Of course, he's also the most isolated of them all.  We learned in the first book that he manipulated the genetics of Raven and Mikhail's unborn daughter so that she would be his perfect lifemate.  He's been waiting for her to become an adult so that he could claim her.<br />What could have been a powerful story just fizzled.  There was really no conflict, other than the usual female-running-away-from-the-Carpathian-lifestyle-with-the-lonely-hero-trying-to-protect-her storyline that has occured in all of the previous books.  It especially made no sense since Savannah is Raven and Mikhail's daughter and I would have expected her to be raised much differently.  Gregori was the classic tortured hero, experiencing love for the first time and trying to come to terms with it and his basic need to protect.  The sex scenes are erotic, but still variations on the same theme used in previous books - a lot of mention of &quot;white-heat&quot;, etc.<br />These books are very formulaic, which isn't a bad thing because they are done well.  They're enjoyable light reading, easy to get lost in.  While they are not great vampire stories, they are perfectly acceptable romances.  And, since I'm a sucker for a dark, handsome, tortured hero, I'll probably read the rest in the series.  I'm just not expecting any intellectual challenge any more.challenge any more.	2002-01-02

Not having really been interested in the horror genre before this year (with the exception of Anne Rice's vampire and witch series), I bought this book because I had read reviews and comments on various sites all raving about Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series.  I have to say, they were right!  This is a great series, and this book sets the tone for the rest of the books in the series.<br /><br />The character of Anita Blake is written with such a strong voice that she becomes totally believable. Her humor is dry and self-deprecating, and is a lynchpin of the story.  She is the sort of person you might like hanging around with, even though you know it might get you seriously maimed.  The tale is told totally from her point of view - the reader knows what she knows, and other characters' behavior is interpreted through her thought processes.  This is one of the interesting challenges of the series, which has given rise to countless message boards - determining character motivations.  She is a kick-ass heroine working (mostly) within the confines of the law, doing her licensed job using her unusual gifts while trying to retain her humanity and morality.  Ms. Hamilton provides us with such a realistic alternative USA that Anita's powers and the beings that inhabit her world seem believable.  Why are the vampires above ground, so to speak?  Because of a Supreme Court decision that ruled that they are living beings deserving of legal protections, of course.  There should be enough gore here for most horror fans, and for romance fans, there is romance but it is very subtle - more setting the stage for what develops in the subsequent books (but once you read those stories, you remember this book and go &quot;a-ha!&quot;).<br />Some people compare Anita Blake to Buffy, but that's an apples-oranges comparison.  Anita is for adults - there is no teenage angst or experimentation, no violence without physical consequence.  Anita is dedicated and professional; she is physically weary by the end of her day and constantly wrestles with her fear that she herself is evil because of what she is capable of doing.  The vampires are complex and frightening - not cartoonishly evil characters that go &quot;poof&quot; when staked.<br />Start with this book, and read the series in order.  Each book, while capable of standing on its own, builds on the previous one in terms of the characters' development and relationships, really adding a whole new dimension to the storyline.  These books are like an addiction - once you start, you'll find you crave the rest.cally weary by the end of her day and constantly wrestles with her fear that she herself is evil because of what she is capable of doing.

I guess it sounds suitably mysterious for people unfamiliar with that area of the world, but it just makes me laugh.<br />If you like your heroes strong and possesive, your heroines feisty and stubborn, then this book is for you.  Mikhail is the ultimate dark and dangerous hereo, about to allow himself to die because of centuries of loneliness.  Raven is a human psychic who picks up on his distress, the first female in years to &quot;touch his soul&quot;.  Their meeting, their developing relationship, and the compromises that have to occur are the main focus of the book.  The threat aspect is the fanatical hunters who view Mikhail as a vampire and want to destroy him, and by extension, his lifemate Raven.<br />Ms. Feehan introduces the Carpathians as a completely different species, not just your run-of-the-mill vampires.  Apparently, after age 200, the Carpathian males begin to lose all touch with emotion - their view of the world becomes literally monochromatic - and they slowly become more and more isolated.  If they don't find a lifemate, they either commit suicide or turn into rogue vampires.  Their species is slowly becoming extinct because there are very few Carpathian females, they breed slowly and tend to produce male offspring, and the babies usually die before their first birthday for some unknown reason.  By the end of the book it all begins to make sense.  She also introduces a number of the other male Carpathians, setting the stage for sequels of their searches for their lifemates.<br />I was going to rate this book a bit higher but then I decided that I had to have a somewhat consistent standard for my vampire book reviews.  I'm using Laurell K. Hamilton's books as my guideline, and this book doesn't compare to one of her four-stars.  This is a fun book and a nice intro to a new series.  I have no doubt that I'll be reading the rest of Ms. Feehan's books.and this book doesn't compare to one of her four-stars.  This is a fun book and a nice intro to a new series.

There was so much backstory to both of the main characters that I wondered if this story was part of a series.<br />The romance was contrived - two gorgeous people masquerading as a honeymoon couple - where have I read that before?  It was the standard attraction-to-sexual-tension-to-lust-to-love route, with the current twist that the female protagonist has to be the one to learn to trust her male counterpart rather than the usual male-learning-to-trust-the-female storyline.  The author just tried too hard to make Ronnie Carmichael (the DEA agent) a sympathetic character, loading her down with a family legacy, an unreasonable father, two dead partners, a prior Internal Affairs investigation, and lack of respect from her co-workers, among other things.<br /><br />It was a pleasant little story, but its eroticism was mild (considering its marketing), and the love story was predictable.  It's good for a one-time read, but I wouldn't consider it a keeper.	2001-12-28

The dialogue was sexy, humorous, and touching.  The main characters were nicely developed and had depth to them, interacting well with the secondary characters.  The erotic nature of their relationship was well done and graphic.  Their growing love for each other was nicely presented, and importantly, made sense in the context of the story.  Their ultimate comprehension of each other's motives and behavior was very believable based upon the way the story developed, rather than just being abruptly presented in order to tie up loose ends.<br />I will definitely put this author on my to-buy list.	2001-12-28

Disregard the storyline teaser about the handyman who's good with his hands.  This book was much more than that.  The focus was kept tight on a few main issues, rather than stuffing the story full of plots and subplots which can never be fully developed in such a restricted format.  More importantly, the lead characters were just really nice people - easy to identify with and wish the best.<br />The author allowed us into the thought processes of both characters, giving both equal value.  Suzanne and Greg were both interesting people who had unexpected depth.  The gradual unveiling of their true natures and dreams was done nicely.  The dialogue was well written.  The sex was graphic and inventive, rather than the standard euphemistic presentation.  Their romance was lovely.  It was a nice story, worth reading.	2001-12-28

A reader who is paying attention will figure out what was actually going on well before the final scene, but it actually isn't that important because so many stumbling blocks are thrown in front of the lead characters, it's just fun watching them twist and turn to avoid them on their way to the truth.  The secondary characters were a conniving bunch who continued to make life difficult for our heroes.<br />Maggie is a nice person who becomes morality-challenged through unforseen life circumstances.  Tim is a fine example of what the average federal employee is like - just trying to do a good job and getting no public credit for it.  A mild romance between them finally starts to develop by the end of the book, but it wasn't the primary focus of the book.  This book begs the question, what would you do if you had access to all that money?<br />I'm looking forward to further books by Ms. Terreri.	2001-12-19

I thought that the whole society was more concisely explained in this book.  It also gives the backstory about the Grey Lady mentioned in the Trilogy.<br />This storyline is more straight-forward than the Trilogy.  The characters in this book would seem to be easier for a new reader to understand (in that they're less exotic, everything being relative of course) and the realms are presented in a less complicated fashion, yet the book still gives an intriguing hint of of the depth and complexity of the Trilogy books.  There are enough teases about Daemon Sadi, Lucivar Yaslana, Surreal, and the rest of the Trilogy characters to make reading the other books inevitable - even just to find out the outcome of Dorothea SaDiablo's machinations, not to mention learning whether or not Daemon Sadi's true love is ever born.  And for the readers who've already read the Trilogy, the teases were nice reminders of what makes the Trilogy so special.<br />Even if you've stayed away from fantasy, this book is a good introduction to the genre, since there are enough points of familiarity for a new reader to feel confortable with.  Best of all, if you enjoy this book, you have the three books of the Trilogy to look forward to!	2001-12-17

The title itself is bad enough.<br />Having got that off my chest, if you are a time travel fan who likes to have at least a bit of scientific reality present to ground the story, this book is going to drive you crazy.  An electronic toy seems to act as a gateway to the past specifically to the Scottish Highlands of the 1500's, a cell phone still works and is able to reach the 21st century - you get the picture.  If this kind of thing trips you up, then you'll probably just be annoyed with the story.<br />However, if you can suspend your disbelief about the whole time travel thing, this is a cute and amusing book.  This is one of those feisty women meeting up with a gorgeous stud who's never had a woman turn him down in his life kind of books.  The cultural clashes are amusing, sexual tension is nicely maintained, the romance is sweet, and the book is actually better than the title and the cover would lead you to believe.  I'd rate it higher, but the whole cell phone bit, while a central device in the story, aggravated me.	2001-12-14

I liked the characters, and I liked the fact that Ms. Fox gave voice to both Delaney and Jack, but Delaney's antics to try to hide the fact that Jack was her daughter's father were just a little too ridiculous and heavy-handed.  I would have thought that since she had decided early on not to have contact with the child's father, she would have come up with a good cover story to explain her single parenthood.  I also would have expected her to keep her facts straight without resorting to writing them down in a list and putting it where it could be found.  After all, she knew she was returning to the town where the child was conceived, and someone may have noticed her and Jack together.<br />The characters were all interesting and amusing, the romance sexy, and the dialogue humorous, but the contrived and somewhat annoying nature of the plot conflict is what makes this book rate only 3 stars, which is a shame because there was a lot of potential here.	2001-12-13

She's a &quot;nice&quot; woman, and becomes friends with Detective Shane Huntington, the Huntington family's black sheep.  It seems he turned his back on his family's tradition of becoming proctologists by joining the police force, and they've never quite forgiven him.  In order to meet conditions of an inheritance, he has to get married to a woman who meets a set of exacting conditions.  Of course he turns to Paige the librarian for help in finding the perfect wife.<br />This was an amusing and fast-paced story.  It had some classic themes of the genre - Paige's transformation in designer gowns, snobbish family members, the answer to Shane's dilemma being right before his eyes, etc. - but they were all done with style and wit.  It was a very enjoyable story.<br />Jane Sullivan's &quot;The Matchmaker's Mistake&quot; is another excellent example of why I'm always on the lookout for one of her books. Her stories never fail to entertain.  This story tells the tale of Mark McAlister, accountant.  He's up for a coveted partnership in his firm, but he can see his chances slowly diminishing because he has neither the style nor the connections nor the trophy wife to advance the interests of the firm.  Mark is not a one-dimensional character; he's overcome a lot in his earlier life to get where he is today, and it has scarred him.  He goes to a bar to try to meet his perfect future wife, and is ultimately taken under the wing of Liz Prescott, the bartender.  Liz takes pity on him and decides to take him in hand and help him achieve his goal.<br />This story was a version of Pygmalion in reverse.  Liz is the free spirit who is trying to loosen up up Mark and recreate his image.  Both characters were wonderful, the writing sharp and humorous, and the romance lovely.  This book is definitely a keeper.r.	2001-12-13

I enjoyed this book but I sure didn't weep over it.<br />Ms. Sullivan took the standard plot of town bad boy and invisible girl and gave it a nice twist.  Her portrayal of a small town as one full of unforgiving people with long memories was more realistic than some other authors' versions.  This wasn't a town full of nice friendly people just waiting to give someone a second chance.<br />Cole McCallum and Ginny White began the story at opposite ends of the spectrum - he's a ladies man from way back and a black sheep with an arson exoneration hanging over him, and she is a lonely, friendless, untouched (literally and figuratively) woman.  They marry in haste for financial reasons, and slowly learn to value and love each other.  The shell he's built around himself slowly begins to dissolve and his real personality is revealed as he comes to terms with his childhood scars.  She grows as a person - losing her fears brought on by her mother's clinging overprotectiveness and religious narrow-mindedness, becoming more self-confident, and also comfortable with her own sexuality.<br />Acutally, all of that sounds rather boring, but it wasn't.  The characters' personal fears were believable.  There were a lot of scenes in the book that just bring a smile to your face.  Ms. Sullivan handled their personal growth and their growing sexual awareness/love nicely.  The troubles in their relationship were realistic.  She made them into human beings that the reader would care about, and resolved the storyline nicely.  This is definitly a book worth reading.	2001-12-12

Each book can stand alone, of course, but reading them in order allows you to understand how the characters and their relationships have evolved and deepened.<br />Having said that, I really love this book!  Everyone has their favorites in the series, and this is one of mine.  I like it because, as usual, Ms. Hamilton used a lot of characters in the story, but more importantly, the secondary characters' personalities were developed more fully than they had been in a lot of the previous books.  There were more in-depth scenes between Anita and Jamil, Jason, Nathaniel, Asher, Cherry, Zane, and Damian, than there had been previously.  They became persons in their own right in this book.  Jamil and Anita come to terms with their animosity toward each other; Jason's character is expanded and his friendship with Anita grows; the neediness of Nathaniel is finally understood by Anita; Asher's feelings toward Anita are finally exposed; Anita's affect on Damian is explained and their ties are strengthened; and Cherry and Zane become more than convenient wereleopard stand-ins.<br />For Jean-Claude fans, more is revealed about his motivations and his feelings toward Anita.  For Richard fans, he and Anita finally do the deed (at long last, and well worth waiting for).  For Anita fans, she begins to come to terms with her role within the wereleopard pard, her relationships with &quot;the boys&quot;, and a crisis of faith is resolved.  She also learns to deal with her expanding powers resulting from the tightening of the marks that bind her to Richard and Jean-Claude.  As an extra bonus, we get to meet Richard's mom, and his brother Daniel.<br />The story is well-written and is horrific, amusing, graphic, scary, sexy, and witty.  It has vampires, werewolves, wereleopards, trolls, corrupt police, a sadistic murderer, a sorcerer, and - worst of all - Richard's angry ex-girlfriends!  It is definitely a keeper!	2001-12-12

Ruth finds a portal into Melior's world and enters it, searching for the missing part of her soul which is magically bound into the Sword of Maiden's Tears, and also, the love of her life, Melior.<br />This time the setting is in Melior's world, and we learn that all is not sweetness and light there.  New characters are introduced and are better developed than those in the first book.  Familiar characters from the first book are expanded.  The whole setting seems to have been better thought out, or else I just found it more interesting than the rather claustrophobic Columbia University setting in the first book.<br />A warning though: if you buy this book, search out and buy the third in the series, &quot;The Cloak of Night and Daggers&quot;, if you want to know what happens, because this book has a cliffhanger ending	2001-12-12

This was the first book that I've ever read by Ms. Cooper.  I picked it up intially because I had been to St. John, U.S.V.I. a few times in the past, and wanted to see which sites were mentioned.<br />I liked this book, but I found the writing style to be a bit spare.  I have no real mental image of what the protagonist and her husband look like, or whether or not I would like them if I met them.  The story itself was interesting, and the sibling problems added a nice twist to the story.  Actually, I probably would have liked the book better if the family relationships were the sole focus of the book (Ms. Cooper seemed to handle that well).  The mystery seemed to be a secondary issue here, and the whole treatment of the crimes that were occuring seemed too lackadaisical.<br />Although I liked the book, I don't yet know if I care enough about the characters to read the other stories.  I'll have to think about that for a while...	2001-12-09

The characters are quirky, humorous, and vulnerable.  True love, of course, prevails.  It's a book definitely worth reading.<br />Jill Shalvis' &quot;New And...Improved&quot; took the tried and true formula of a nondescript female scientist getting a makeover and a whole new outlook on life, and made it fun and believable.  The sexual tension was done well, and so was the everyday interaction of the characters.  The combination of lust, love, and humor was handled deftly.<br />Jennifer LaBrecque's &quot;Andrew In Excess&quot; just confirmed my enjoyment of her books.  It took the ticking-body-clock theme and presented it with believable characters.  It was nice to have the female protagonist be a quirky yet not ditzy person, one who knew her own mind and went after what she wanted.  It was interesting to watch the &quot;stuffed-shirt&quot; lawyer-type reveal more and more layers of his character that didn't fit the stereotype.  Some of the scenes in this book were laugh-out-loud funny.  It's a great romantic comedy.	2001-12-09

He lusted after her, she didn't know he existed until he took a bullet for her in a botched jewelry story robbery attempt.  Then, while he was hospitalized, sexual combustion took place, and their relationship advanced at amazing speed, considering that both of them had up to that point in time seemed to have been rather choosey about their sexual encounters.<br />But - the characters were well-written and believable.  The secondary characters were integral to the storyline.  The sex scenes were graphic and plentiful.  I found myself liking the characters, being amused by their reactions, and caught up in the mystery.  It was a good story and worth reading.<br />This was one of those books where the hero's friends are all gorgeous guys, so of course, the reader wants to know their stories too.  Ms. Foster has thankfully provided sequels - Zach's story is in &quot;Treat Her Right&quot;, and Josh's is in &quot;Mr. November&quot;, both Harlequin Temptation books.	2001-12-09

I've liked other books by Eugenia Riley, but this one had too much book for too little plot.  The book was well written but about seventy-five pages could have been cut from this book without damaging it.<br />Courtney and Mark get together right at the beginning of the book, she gets pregnant, and then the rest of it is spent dithering how they are going to get their lifestyles and careers to coincide.  It became boring after a while.  Mark was almost the perfect man - gorgeous, smart, wealthy, loving, humorous, protective - yet Courtney kept having all of this angst over her career vs. his, men who betrayed her trust in the past, proving herself in her chosen field, etc.  I started to sympathize less and less with her as the book went on.  It was one one of those familiar plots where the heroine can't see what's actually important in life until it smacks her in the face.<br />Having said all that, the characters themselves were amusing in some ways, but I wouldn't say that I laughed out loud at any of the scenes.  Some of the situations that Courtney found herself in stretched credulity to the extreme (and I'm not even talking about the intial plot set-up).  She is the CEO of a large company, yet whenever something goes wrong in one of the company stores, she has to go personally there to straighten it out.  Hasn't she ever heard of delegation?  And, it made no sense why she continued to work for Mark's grandfather, given all the grief she had to take from him - she has a MBA from Harvard, for goodness sake!  Also, all of her siblings decide to go on consecutive cruises, and just happen to leave each of their respective broods with Courtney and Mark, the two people in the family with the most high-powered, time-intensive jobs?  There were other annoyances, but you should be able to get the picture by now.<br />I expected more from this book, and didn't get it.	2001-12-09

Ms. Bishop has created an interesting society where Old Places in each community are the sites of magic and where the witches (women connected to the earth and elements, not the Wicked Witch of the West type) live, a land of the Fae which connects to the human world through roads that pass through the Veil.  Of course there is a problem in this paradise - there roads are disappearing and the Clans of the Fae near those roads are vanishing without reason.  Trouble is also coming for the witches in the form of misogynistic, witch-hating man who calls himself the Witch's Hammer and who, with his group of Inquisitors, is dedicated to eradicating witches from the land.<br />The story centers around Ari, a young witch whose mother and grandmother recently died, and who is slowly being shunned by her community.  And that's the problem with this story.  Ari is rather a dull character.  She is mainly concerned with home, hearth, and the land.  She's unworldly and lonely, yet she is the lust object of a Baron's son, the love object a kind mortal man, and the object of desire of a lord of the Fae, and it just doesn't make any sense.  The storyline, as it swirls around her and what is happening in the society, is interesting, but I never really felt any connection to the characters, except to Morag the Gatherer (of souls).  She seemed to be the most developed of them all, probably because she was proactive.<br /><br />The book was enjoyable and readable but you could tell in advance the way things were going to work out.  There were no real surprises.  It was a pleasant way to spend a few hours, but don't expect it to change your existence.	2001-12-07

There are city dwellers, farmers, wandering tribes and angels (yup, with wings and all).  Their god, Jovah, only has direct contact with three human oracles, who contact him through metal and glass screens.  Only one person in living memory had direct contact with Jovah, and he went mad.  The angels petition Jovah on behalf of the population - in matters of illness, famine, weather and the like.  A new Archangel is chosen every 20 years to lead the people, and he or she must be married to the mate chosen by Jovah before they take up their duties.<br />This book is about the Archangel Gabriel who is about to replace the Archangel Raphael as the primary angel who leads the population, and who must also lead in the annual singing of the Gloria to Jovah.  If the Gloria isn't sung, or isn't done properly by the Archangel and his mate, Jovah will destroy their world.  Unfortunately, Gabriel has left the mate-finding bit to the last minute and he's having a hard time locating her before the deadline.<br />Ms. Shinn has created a fascinating world, and her use of familiar names in strange situations constantly forces the reader to readjust their preconceptions.  One would assume an Archangel named Raphael to be a force for good, based upon familiar Christian teachings, but in this book is that really true?  There are angels, but are they the familiar holy beings or just beings with wings?  And then there is the whole question of what, exactly, is Jovah?<br />This is the first book in the Samaria Trilogy, and I'm looking forward to the rest.	2001-12-06

Boy, was I wrong!  I was unpleasantly surprised to find out that they were just condensed versions of previous published novels, one that I know for sure I already own.  The stories have been distilled down to just basically dialogue and sex scenes - any meaningful character development has been cut out, along with descriptions of settings and motivations.  The sex scenes lose much of their impact when you don't really know enough about the characters to even care what they're doing.<br />The hatchet job done to Jayne Ann Krentz' two stories (one as Stephanie James) was horrible (and the Krentz original story to begin with wasn't one of her best anyway).  Continuity was the worst with the Stephanie James story.  The Sherry Woods story tried to fit too much into too small a format - a lost love, losing the family farm, a tornado, a child falling down a well, etc. - all that in forty pages!  Probably the best of the collection were the stories by Candace Schuler.  They seemed to fit the format the best, but still, the conflicts were reduced to their most simplistic terms - white woman fitting into the Navajo world and lust, ex-spouses finally learning to compromise and lust.<br />My recommendation?  Don't Take 5 - take your five and buy full-length novels.	2001-12-06

The Beltenes, a family of Welsh descent, have been in the area for centuries and basically control it financially and politically, due to certain peculiarities in their nature.  Rhiannon Beltene has just been chosen The Beltene, the leader of the family and its fortunes.  This is a role that gets passed around periodically to the eldest &quot;Unchanged&quot; member of the family.<br />Rhiannon, however, is initially not happy with being The Beltene.  She is a writer of popular vampire fiction, and has never been that deeply involved with family matters.  All that changes when a series of dead bodies start showing up around town, with incision marks on their necks and the bodies drained of blood, and their deaths dedicated to Rhiannon.  Advance notice of the murders was sent to the tabloids and they have descended upon the town en masse.  To complicate matters, there is a new Sheriff, Daniel Thorpe (who is not of Welsh descent, nor is he a local), chosen by the older members of her family (one of whom is the mayor), and who is unaware of the true nature of the Beltenes.  Unfortunately for Dan, he doesn't know that the elders are also playing matchmaker - Rhiannon does, and she's not pleased by it.<br />The Beltene family is large, but Ms. Brewer kindly gives the reader a cast of characters, maps and floor plans at the beginning of the book to quickly orient the reader.  This was one of those books that when it ends, you're surprised that it's over.  Hopefully the sequel won't be long in arriving.	2001-12-06

It wasn't a horrifying as I thought it was going to be, or maybe I've just become inured to murder and mutilation in stories.  (Scary thought, that.)  It was pretty clear-cut as to who the killer was in both locations, and any other town faced with that number of dead bodies would have surely called in the FBI.  But leaving all that aside, it was an interesting premise, with a stalwart but emotionally wounded hero, a heroine who's rediscovered her personal strength, and a child who wasn't obnoxious.	2001-12-03

She's the one who's resistant to more committment, since her life is overextended with responsibilities already.  Some classic Evanovich scenes (including a wrecked car!).  I've noticed that the sexual encounters in her Loveswept series books are a little more graphic than those in her Stephanie Plum novels, for those of you who care about such things.  Also appearing in this book are the prototypes for Grandma Mazur and Uncle Sandor's car.  The characters were sexy, sneaky, witty and just plain funny.  It's a book worth finding.	2001-12-03

Ms. Adair took a subject with faintly taboo overtones (romance between step-siblings) and gave it a nice spin.  For those of you uncomfortable by the subject, know that the characters are in no way blood kin, and nothing nasty happened while they were children.  This is one of those &quot;she's loved him forever, he finally notices her as something other than a kid sister&quot; kind of books.  The twist being that, after an incident earlier in their lives, he made a vow to his father always to be a good big brother to her and to watch over and protect her, a vow he's now having a hard time keeping.<br />What I liked about this book is that it told the story from both character's viewpoints.  She is trying to make him aware of her as a woman, but unknown to her, he's been aware of that fact for a long time and has been trying to resist it.  She's a nester, he's a player, she wants marriage, he wants to be free.  Both have issues resulting from their parents' multiple marriages.<br />The plot device to bring them together, while a familiar one, worked in this book, because the sexual tension was maintained without becoming silly.  I've usually stayed away from the Harlequin Temptation books just because of the covers which always seem to show photos of people half-undressed in bed, but I was pleased with this one and may try more in the series since the phrase &quot;you can't judge a book by it's cover&quot; seems to apply with them. :-)	2001-11-28

I hate that type of book and usually never finish them because the deceit is usually so foolish.  Not in this story, however.  Both Natalie and Tate have valid reasons for their behavior - this is her last chance to redeem herself professionally, and he's trying to protect his family from her.  It's interesting to watch Natalie face her personal demons, and it was a nice change of pace to have Tate recognize them and try to help her, instead of just writing her off.<br />All of the characters behaved in a believable fashion and were true to themeselves.  And it was so nice to see Tate's son Jordan portrayed as a product of loving home, behaving and expressing himself in a natural way, rather than being set up as \\"the alien in the household\\".<br />I've read several of Ms. Pappano's books, and so far, I've enjoyed all of them.  Her characters are complex people, the (...)attraction between them is well done, and her plots are always interesting.	2001-11-27

Of course, as soon as he arrives, he is mugged and the sword is stolen.  Unfortunately, if a human handles the sword, they will shortly tranform into a ravaging monster with a craving for human flesh.  RM hooks up with a group of mismatched Columbia University friends, and the quest is on to find the sword.<br />At first, I didn't like any of the characters except RM - the stranger in an even stranger land.  They didn't seem to ring true, their speech patterns or something didn't seem right for their ages, or maybe they didn't behave as my college friends and I did.  But gradually, once the background of some of the characters was revealed, their behavior became more understandable, given their flaws.  (Though I still found myself checking the copyright date a couple of times.)  There was still a little too much pretentious quoting and epigram-throwing for them to be believable, but I guess the author had to get it out of her system.  The mugger who wound up with the sword was a tragic character, slowly taking that one extra step at a time that was leading him away from his dreams.<br />I wasn't all that happy with the ending until I realized that it was just the set-up for the sequel, which I will try to read.  It was an interesting book, worth reading, but the characters could have been a little less stereotypical.	2001-11-27

Other reviewers have given the plot synopsis, so I'll just say that if you're a fan of both vampire and mystery genres, you'll like the books in this series.  The stories are well-written and the characters have depth to them.<br />All of the books in the Laws of the Blood series are stand-alones, but the previous two made mention of Istvan, the Enforcer of the Enforcers, always speaking of him in tones of dread.  This is Istvan's story and it was interesting to read his point of view.  What also made this book enjoyable was the fact that his companion is a strong person in her own right, and is not too happy to find herself in the role of companion.  This book also brought back some characters from the previous books, so it was nice to get the update on their stories.	2001-11-24

But, a number of the other reviewers who are Laurell K. Hamilton fans have recommended this book, so I decided to give it a try.<br />This is similar to LKH in that it takes place in an alternative reality USA where magic is somewhat acknowledged, and the existence of vampires, werewolves, and other things that go bump in the night is not disbelieved.  However, Harry Dresden's character is not very similar to LKH's Anita Blake, so don't read the series expecting a male version of her.  Harry is his own person, and an interesting one at that.  He knows his magic but has problems with everyday appliances.  He is well-mannered and caring in a world that doesn't always appreciate such things.<br />To balance out his personality, there is Lt. Karrin Murphy, who has all of the aggressiveness that Harry lacks.  Harry is her consultant on police matters of a supernatural nature, and isn't very respected by the other members of her team.<br />I enjoyed this book because Harry is a likable guy, and it's easy to empathize with his circumstances - professional, financial, and personal.  The magical aspects of the story are well-explained, the killings are horrifying, the main characters are interesting, and the secondary characters are quirky.  All in all, a nice package.	2001-11-24

Books	2	18	18	N	N	Author Needs A Better Editor	This rating should actually be a 2-and-a-half star rating.<br />Initially, the characters in this book annoyed me.  First of all, the author used names like \\"Carprithia Feather\\", \\"Ozzie Oxhandler\\" and \\"Hortense Horsenettle\\" for some of the secondary characters.  That started my eyes rolling.  Then the female lead, Willi Gallagher, who is supposed to be about 31 years old, started behaving in a fashion more suited to one of those nosy ladies of \\"a certain age\\" in British cozies.  After that, characters are thrown at the reader left and right, without ever really giving them a firm place in the story.<br />Some of the characters were a little too idiosyncratic, but hopefully that will be toned down in future books.  Also, Willi really used a lot of non-PC terms in regards to the male lead, Quannah Lassiter, a Native American.  Political correctness is not a big bugaboo for me, but even I was surprised that she called him those names, considering that she is supposed to be an English teacher and should know the power of words.  The cover states that this is the first in the Willi Gallagher Mysteries, so I'll give the author the benefit of the doubt.  The story needed to be tightened up, though.  There is one scene where Willi is looking at all the teacher-chaperones' personalized drinking cups; the only problem is, they're all on a students' tour to Galveston.  Who brings along their own cup on a trip?  Willi was bopping around from one scene to the other, really for no discernable reason.  She was also just a little too spunky and foolhardy, which got to be annoying, considering the number of times she was physically harmed in the story.  Anyone else hurt that much would be in bed for at least a week.<br />All in all, even after all that, it was an okay book that shows promise for the future sequels.  It's a good book to while away some spare hours.  The story did get better further into the book, and I did finish it.  I'll probably read the next in the series, too, because I did like Willi and Quannah by the end.ecause I did like Willi and Quannah by the end.	2001-11-21

Big deal, you say.  Been there, done that.  However, Rachel is a special agent for the US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service - not one of the typical literary government crime-busting agencies.  This allows the author to approach the crime from a completely different direction, which was a nice change of pace.<br />The characters were interesting.  Rachel is a person who is used to running from her problems, and here she's forced to make a choice and decide whether or not to take a stand.  Her boss, who initially seemed like a stereotypical boss from hell, has depth to his character.  The detective in charge of the investigation is not one of the usual stalwart heroes - there are a lot of dark shadings to his character.  The secondary characters all have their own charm.<br />The story takes place in New Orleans and its surrounding swamplands.  Rachel is called in when a dead alligator is found at the scene of a murder - a hooker has beeen ritualistically slashed to death.  The story begins with that and then takes off into political corruption, murder, drug running, neo-Nazis, and the Mob.  The descriptions of the people, politics and places are vivid and realistic.<br />This is the first of the Rachel Porter series.  I enjoyed this one so much, I bought the sequels.	2001-11-18

It doesn't bog down with technical explanations of how the relocation of a portion of modern-day West Virginia into medieval Germany occurred.  It just happens, and the story moves on from there.  There is no &quot;trying to get back&quot;.  The focus instead is on the people involved and how they learn to cope and function in their new world, how the people of the Old World adjust to technologically superior people in their midst, and just how a new nation is created.<br />Another reviewer was of the opinion that there wasn't enough tension.  I don't know about that.  There was tension, there just wasn't a lot of heartbreak, which was truly a nice change of pace.  In many books, there is a lot of specious tragedy, just to exemplify the difficulties encountered.  I liked the fact that in this book, confrontations didn't always go as expected, and people didn't always live up to their sterotype.<br />This was a great book to while away a lazy day, and at 597 pages, a good book for travelling.	2001-11-11
US	52593236	R6J12KFLBTXSM	0425181685	449119181	Narcissus in Chains (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 10)	Books	4	2	3	N	Y	Anita Blake Newbies, Start With "Guilty Pleasuers" First!	This is a revised review (because I re-read the book and my opinion changed slightly).<br />This is definitely not the book to read to introduce yourself to Anita Blake's universe (Anitaverse). Without knowing the background of the characters, a new reader would be totally lost. Knowing the background of the characters and the prior storyline adds so much to this book. I would definitely recommend reading this series in order, starting with the first book, \\"Guilty Pleasures\\".<br />Having said that, this book is definitely for the fans, in that it brings back almost every character in the Anitaverse. The primary focus is Anita, her relationships, and the effects on her of the joining of the psychic marks between her (a necromancer), Jean-Claude (a master vampire), and Richard (a werewolf leader). It also introduces a huge number of new characters. And that is a problem, because with so many new people, the old ones are slightly shortchanged with their behavior somewhat inconsistent, and the new ones aren't really fully developed. I think the previous book, \\"Obsidian Butterfly\\" was much more tightly plotted.  For example, the whole question about Asher, the extent of his disfigurement, and what happened with Narcissus, set up in the teaser in \\"Out Of This World\\" is just left hanging (no pun intended). We also find out what's been happening with Damian since Anita was gone, but when everything is said and done, he's still basically in the same situation he was in at the end of \\"Blue Moon\\" - Anita's vampire-to-call and still happy about it. But no mention is made of how that is going to function day-to-day. (Which annoyed me to no end, since I'm a Damian fan.) But fans of Nathaniel will be pleased - he's heavily involved in this story and even (gasp!) exhibits some personal growth! Anita herself changes so much in this story that you have to wonder, what monsters are there out there left for her to fear?<br />The \\"mystery\\" definitely takes a backseat in this story. The book is chock full of plots and subplots, which makes for an interesting read, but the mystery itself is only a means to an end, not the primary focus. One of the villians of the piece is quite clear early on.<br />The introduction of Micah (the wereleopards' Nimir-Raj) as Anita's new alternate main squeeze seemed very forced - their relationship advanced way too quickly to be true to Anita's previous hesitancy towards personal commitment and her avowed moral character, \\"ardeur\\" or not. It would have been more believable if she had resisted the \\"ardeur\\" at least once (I'm thinking of her resitance to the munin in previous books). Her relationship with Jean Claude vacillated hot and cold throughout the book. In the beginning chapters, when she reunites with him, their relationship seems to be on a much steadier footing (and the reader is thinking \\"at last\\"). But as the story progresses, and she finds out how he's had to cope with things caused by her absence, her attitude didn't ring true and her anger at him wasn't really understandable. As mentioned by another reviewer, Richard seems as though he's being phased out for the time being. But even his behavior wasn't consistent - at first he's at peace with his beast, then we've got the angst again, then he's okay with it, then he he wants to die. That last attitude didn't make any sense at all. A suicidal Richard? I don't think so.<br />This book is much more sexually graphic than the rest of the series. This is not going to please a lot of readers, but it was inevitable. There had to be some sort of resolution to the situation that has been building up in the previous books. Everything made sense in the context of the story, but the sexual tension was virtually nil because everything was acted upon. And sexual tension has been one of the strong hallmarks of these books. Some scenes were definitely not for the sexually squeamish, but the scene where everyone suddenly realized that Anita wasn't on birth control *was* funny. The problem for a lot of readers will be that Anita does a complete 180 in her attitude toward her sexual behavior, as compared to her rather uptight behavior in the last book, \\"Obsidian Butterfly\\".<br />Contrary to what it might seem, I really did enjoy the book (even though I think that the changes to Anita's character are starting to go from the sublime to the ridiculous, I have faith that LKH will settle things somewhere along the line.).  My complaints are really just the annoyances of a rabid fan, because things aren't evolving the way *I* think they should. But then again, I'm not Anita's creator - I'm just along for the ride. That's what makes this series so interesting - just when you think you know what is going to happen, the storyline takes a sharp left and heads off into a completly different direction. This is a fast-moving, enjoyable book. Most of the favorite characters got their moment in the sunlight (or moonlight, as the case may be), and fans of the wereleopard pard should be ecstatic. It is a typical LKH rollercoaster - erotic, horrific, violent, romantic.  It's a book where something is happening all the time, and the many subplots ultimately tie together at the end. I know me, I'll probably wind up re-reading it a couple more times. (...)funny.

Read it if you just want to pass the time, rather than get emotionally involved.  It involves a US naval officer and a civilian, set in Coronado Beach CA.  He is duty-oriented, she is outgoing, both have issues with their fathers, etc., etc.  Plenty of secondary characters - enough for spinoffs anyway.<br />I don't know if this is being marketed as a multicultural book, but except for some Spanish phrases here and there, the families could have been any family with strong ethnic ties (at least the ones that I'm familiar with).  It would have been more interesting if the author given more background as to why certain items had the significance they seem to have had to the characters.<br />The main characters, Alex and Marissa, really didn't have much depth.  Both appeared to be eye-candy.  The conflicts were standard, as were their resolutions.  In real life, I think that a person such as Marissa would be just too tiring to be around - her personality was just too consistently enthusiastic for a grown woman.  Alex was a more realistic character but again, his problems were simplistic - things that we've already read in way too many books.<br />I seem to be damning this book with faint praise, but really, it wasn't bad.  It was just that I expected more and didn't get it.	2001-08-31

This isn't the be-all and end-all of romance novels, but it's good for a quick read.  The plot could have been tightened up more - as others have mentioned, the ancient Native American flashback sequences seemed to be just dropped into the storyline without any explanation as to why Tess, an apparent Boston native, would be subject to them.  Also, the &quot;bad guys&quot; were a little too faceless.  But Tess and TJ had the requisite romantic appeal, the town was interesting, and the story flowed easily.	2001-06-17

I laughed out loud so many times reading this book, it is one of my favorites!  Although it plays into a lot of the NJ stereotypes, it's not done with malice and for those of us who live here, we know that a lot of it is actually true. (We ALL know people who resemble some of the characters in the book!)<br />But you don't have to be from NJ to love this series.  I've read all the books so far, and I haven't gotten tired of the characters, as I have with some other mystery series.  The dialog is sharp and witty, and all of the characters are distinctive.  Stephanie Plum is an enjoyable character, and Morelli and Ranger are simply to die for.  The mystery is good, too.

I would recommend this book on the strength of that alone.  The story about a father raising triplets alone was a change of pace.  He is a successful morning DJ and the love interest turns out to be his partner on the show, who is married but whose husband has been missing in the Middle East for the past 5 years. His ex-wife is also involved in the story.  Quinn's characters are interesting and have depth.  The 7 year old triplets are adorable and not cloying - they seem like real kids, each with her own personality. The romance and its accompanying conflicts are realistic.  I've never read anything by her before, but now I'm going to check her books out.<br />Debbie Macomber's book, on the other hand, was just a bit of fluff.  I normally like her books, but this story was just a waste of time.  How can you have a legend about a wedding dress when only one person ever wore it before?  The main character was supposedly a career-oriented woman, but she fell apart at the receipt of the dress and behaved like a ditzy female, panicking at the thought of &quot;being controlled by fate&quot; and turning down a relationship with a man that anyone else would have grabbed with both hands.  I lost patience with her silliness. The hero was rather simplistically defined.<br />I'd give Quinn's book 4 stars and Macomber's 2 stars, so I averaged it as a 3 star book.	2001-06-02

She is the best-known author in this anthology, but her story is the worst.  As another reviewer has already pointed out, the book blurb regarding her story is totally deceptive.  Her characters are shallow, their relationship unfathomable, and the language used in the sex scenes is jarring, considering the time setting of this story.<br />The story by Leandra Logan, seemed as though there was too much story trying to be crammed into too few pages, so the story felt choppy to me. The initial sex scene set up as a one-night-stand didn't seem true to the female lead.  There were some interesting secondary characters, but the story form is just too short to allow adequate development of that many characters.<br />I felt that the stories by Adrianne Lee and Anne Marie Winston were the best of the bunch.  The characters were better developed, the sexual tension better maintained, and storyline flowed better. I would recommend the book for the sake of these authors.  I don't know if they have written anything else, but I'm certainly going to find out.	2001-05-31

The main storyline between the parents was very familiar - I've read similar stories in number of books, and this one didn't add anything new to it.  The reason for the intial separation didn't ring true given the mother's love of Native American spirituality, and the way she seemed more suited to the West rather than New England.<br />Sage's story was a little more interesting, but I didn't have to waste much brainpower figuring out what was going to happen.

It became tiring, rather than interesting, trying to keep up with what was going on.
