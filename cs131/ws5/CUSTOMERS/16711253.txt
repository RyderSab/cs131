The authors explain that cats have been painted in India and Japan for centuries, and that there are petting rituals for preparing them to participate in this experience. In Ayuba, an independent territory of Botswana in Africa, cat faces are ritually painted to ward off evil spirits. A sign from the cat is required prior to commencing with the painting. <br /> <br />In contemporary western countries, this is now a fad. The results are astoundingly beautiful.  <br /> <br />The reviewer was still left wondering about what cats' rights advocates would say, and still hesitant to recommend a book that appeared to be potentially unfriendly to felines, until his daughter showed him a book of parallel beautiful examples of human body painting: <br />Roberto Edwards (Photographer), Painted Bodies: By Forty-Five Chilean Artists, Abbeville Press 1996 <br />	2005-01-07

She relates to each as an individual, and works with each by communicating and explaining - as well as using the clear and consistent behavioral approaches common to animal trainers. She advises people to explore what is right in their unique relationship with their animal companions, taking into account their own personality and that of their animal. <br /> <br />Frost has excellent suggestions and discussion on basics of training for the habits that will enable dogs and people to get along comfortably together. <br /> <br />In addition to offering training to people and animals, Frost has dedicated much of her life to helping animals in need. She describes a remarkable rescue of 13 malnourished dogs out of larger pack that had run wild all of its life in a pen, never having known a positive relationship with humans. The dogs were wounded physically and scarred emotionally. Her approaches in healing them are an inspiration to animal lovers. <br /> <br />Frost brings us great wisdom in this book, suggesting many ways in which we can learn to appreciate and care for the animals we choose or who choose us as companions in this great adventure we call life. Dogs are very much in the present, and can help us find our own sense of the now that opens into spiritual awareness.  <br /> <br />Talking to your animal mentally, explaining the messages you want to convey, is very potent in training them to understand ways of behaving that will help the two of you get along well. Establishing intuitive and psychic communications with animals also provides another avenue for opening into spiritual dimensions.  <br />	2005-01-07

Hufford is Professor in the Department of Humanities at the Penn State College of Medicine (Hershey Medical Center.  He has had a long-standing interest in traditional healing and parapsychology, both of which serve him will in his analysis of the old hag reports, which have not been included in much of the literature on psychic and spiritual experiences. <br /> <br />Hufford gathered 93 reports from students at Memorial University in Newfoundland, clarifying their experiences with a detailed questionnaire.  Hufford investigates and writes with great clarity. Here are some of his conclusions: <br /> <br />1. The phenomena ... constitute an experience with a complex and stable pattern, which is recognizable and is distinct from other experiences. <br />2. This experience is found in a variety of cultural settings. <br />3. The pattern of the experience and its distribution appear independent of the presence of explicit cultural models. <br />4. The experience itself has played a significant, though not exclusive, role in the development of numerous traditions of supernatural assault. <br />7. The frequency with which the experience occurs is surprisingly high, with those who have had at least one recognizable attack representing 15 percent or more of the general population. <br />8. The state in which this experience occurs is probably best described as sleep paralysis with a particular kind of hypnagogic hallucination. <br />10. The contents of this experience cannot be satisfactorily explained on the basis of current know1edge. <br /> <br />This book does much to clarify an interesting element in the spectrum of transpersonal experiences. <br />	2005-01-07

In response to childhood hurt, we learn to cultivate a heightened awareness, and sharpen our capacity to discern how things move and change in our environment.  Childhood pain encourages us to watch things more closely, to listen more carefully, to attend to the subtle imbalances that arise within and around us.  We develop an exquisite ability to feel the feelings of others, and we become exceptionally mindful of every conflict, every flicker of hope or despair, every piece of information that may hold some teaching for us.  Thus, family pain broke us open and set our hearts on a pilgrimage in search of the love and belonging, safety and abundance, joy and peace that were missing from our childhood story.  Seen through this lens, family sorrow is not only a painful wound to be endured, analyzed, and treated.  It may in fact become a seed that gives birth to our spiritual healing and awakening.\\"   (p. xiii) <br /> <br />\\"Your life is not a problem to be solved but a gift to be opened.  Just as the pain, hurt, and suffering that came to you as a child were powerfully real, so is the tangible resilience of your spirit equally vital and alive. \\"  (p. xiv) <br /> <br />Muller suggests a variety of meditations and exercises that help to absorb, accept and transform our negative reactions to our childhood wounds and to grow and deepen our emotional and spiritual awareness in the process. <br />	2005-01-07

He explains how animals present us with signs and omens that alert us to what is going on in our inner consciousness and how our awareness and intentions manifest into the outer world. Going further into spiritual dimensions, as we waken to our interconnections with all that is, we become more conscious of our co-creation with the ALL. <br /> <br />Andrews points out that many people view such suggestions as no more than superstitions. Superstitions, he points out, are \\"not based upon knowledge or reason. Superstitions often involve irrational fears and behaviours. Superstitions often involve actions that are taken to avoid bad luck. Relationships and correspondences between natural elements and one's own life are not formed from a base of knowledge.\\" (p. 44) <br /> <br />In contrast with superstitious beliefs, which interpret any occurrence of a particular event as representing a given meaning, Andrews explains how nature offers us signs and omens that invite us to understand our relationships with nature, the worlds within us, and spiritual worlds beyond. He has extensive dictionaries for bird and animal totems and what they may convey. <br /> <br />Andrews also suggests ways in which we can open to deeper awarenesses of these realms. <br /> <br />It is not surprising that this book has sold over 300,000 copies.  <br />	2005-01-07

He has been studying the micro cluster structure of water using Magnetic Resonance Analysis. Emoto found that when water from polluted sources is frozen, the crystals have a disorganized, aesthetically ugly appearance. When healing or prayer is directed to the water, its crystalline structure changes to beautiful, symmetric patterns.  <br /> <br />The power of words is suggested in experiments in which positive and negative words were written on pieces of paper and taped to bottles of water from the same source. Correspondingly pretty, symmetrical crystals or disorganized, aesthetically unpleasing forms were produced. Classical music produced aesthetically pleasing crystals while heavy metal music (unspecified) produced chaotic patterns. <br /> <br />Emoto's explorations are ground-breaking beginnings at clarifying some of the influences of conceptual vibrations on water. As 65% of the human body is composed of water, this may provide new avenues to explain some of the influences on the body of mental intents and prayers for healing.  <br />	2005-01-07

This book is rich in anecdotes and reports of healings on physical, psychological and spiritual levels for animals with these approaches after conventional veterinary care had exhausted its potentials to help. Schoen integrates acupuncture, homeopathy and herbal remedies in his practice.  <br /> <br />This is a truly wholistic book, addressing body, emotions, mind, relationships and spirit - both of the animals who were helped and of their owners. <br /> <br />Schoen illustrates his work with many heartwarming stories of his challenges and adventures with animals and their owners. <br /> <br />A typical example is Schoen's description of how he nursed a wild hawk who was paralyzed from the neck down following injuries from a power line. Schoen found ways to tame and heal this wary creature so that it could recover, eventually returning to his wilderness home. As with many of his animal patients, Schoen found himself learning and growing in the process of his ministrations. <br /> <br />\\" ...no creature can remain forever closed to the healing power of love.  I knew that if I could establish an intimate relationship with a bird of prey, I could communicate with any animal, no matter how distant or fearsome it might appear to be.  All I would need was a sensitivity of spirit, a willingness to open myself nonjudgmentally to a dimension of reality where feathers, fur, skin, scales, or hair are stripped away - and where the only language is love. <br /> <br />  \\"Hawkeye had his freedom, and now I had mine.  He had given me my wings, and I was ready to soar.\\" (p. 71) <br /> <br />This is an excellent book for anyone interested in learning about ways of healing that extend beyond conventional veterinary care. <br />	2005-01-07

Many and varied are the ways in which the living on earth and the living in spirit dimensions can communicate. LaGrand's collection of stories is both engaging and informative. <br /> <br />Direct after death communications (ADCs) may occur as auditory, visual, tactile, dream, intuitive, olfactory and out-of-body perceptions by a living person.  <br /> <br />Indirect ADCs may include symbolic, third-party, fourth-party, bird and animal, olfactory and dream communications. As an example, a case is described in which Gina's mother gave her an African violet as a gift, at a time when her mother was ill and not expected to live much longer. Gina had not been successful in keeping similar gifts of her mother's prized African violets alive previously, and tended this one carefully. Its flowers died, but it survived several months, and was still alive when her mother passed on. Two weeks later, blooms suddenly appeared one day - without the prior development of the usual buds. Gina took this as a sign of her mother's communicating that all was well with her in the spirit world.

This book shares lovely insights and wise suggestions for ways to reach into the dimensions that Tolle discovered spontaneously. He believes that all of us have this awareness within us, but that our chattering mind obscures this. <br /> <br />Here is one of a variety of approaches Tolle suggests for finding the quiet center where we can be present - following his format of questions and answers.  <br /> <br />\\"(You keep talking about the state of presence as the key. I think I understand it intellectually, but I don't know if I have ever truly experienced it. I wonder - is it what I think it is, or is it something entirely different?) <br /> <br />It's not what you think it is! You can't think about presence, and the mind can't understand it. Understanding presence is being present. <br /> <br />Try a little experiment. Close your eyes and say to yourself: \\"I wonder what my next thought is going to be.\\" Then become very alert and wait for the next thought. Be like a cat watching a mouse hole. What thought is going to come out of the mouse hole? Try it now. (p. 77)\\" <br /> <br />Tolle points out that good and evil are two sides of the same thing. Again and again, Tolle makes the point that the only productive spiritual goal is to find the place where we are one with \\"the higher good beyond good and bad.\\"  <br /> <br />Thoughtful, helpful book - for letting go of thought-fullness! <br />	2005-01-01

These fields are species-specific collections of experiences individuals have, which are available to all members of the species. These fields provide information on knowledge and behaviors that are helpful to the species, such as migration routes and other learned behaviors. For instance, mice have learned paths through laboratory mazes, and members of the same species who were not direct descendents of the original lab animals subsequently learned the same mazes much more quickly. <br /> <br />In this book, Sheldrake has gathered several hundred reports of dogs, cats and other pets that evidence telepathic and precognitive communications with humans. These occur most often with the animal's primary caretaker, but may also occur with other people who have close bonds with them. <br /> <br />The evidence is presented engagingly, with many examples from the very broad spectrum of phenomena reported in Sheldrake's survey. Pet owners describe not only dogs and cats who show clear alerting behaviors prior to their owners returning home, but also intuitive anticipations and acknowledgments of death of someone close to them; intuitive homing behaviors; and applied/ trained assistance to owners who are blind or have epilepsy or diabetes. <br /> <br />Sheldrake's hypothess that morphogenetic fields explain all of these phenomena is an interesting variation on the themes of intuitive/psychic awareness, collective consciousness, and spiritual dimensions of reality. <br /> <br />Sheldrake's book is highly recommended to anyone interested in animal communications that extend beyond the ordinary physical world of visual and auditory channels. <br />	2005-01-01

It is truly food for the soul. <br /> <br />Catherine Ingram describes her personal experiences in seeking and finding peace in the Now. While mindfulness meditation was a major path, a spiritual teacher catalyzed major shifts in her consciousness. Ingram now teaches mindfulness, through silence, through shared lessons, and (even through the pages of this book) through her personal centeredness. <br /> <br />Seven topics are highlighted: Silence, Tenderness, Embodiment, Genuineness, Discernment, Delight and Wonder. Each is illustrated with lovely stories of Ingram and other seekers on the Path. <br /> <br />Particularly helpful for healing are suggestions for acknowledging the presence of an inner observer who is detached even in the midst of crisis and suffering; for treasuring each present moment rather than living in the past or future; and for accepting that we need not torture ourselves with guilt and remorse because each of us has a lifetime of lessons to learn - and each experience offers us opportunities to develop deeper compassion for others who have their own lessons and make mistakes that may impact negatively on us. We can fester in negative reactions to life that is past or in our anxieties about our future life - or we might just let go of the negativity and move on to the ever-present Now. <br /> <br />I was surprised to discover this book was immediately helpful in finding a stronger connection with my own center of quiet awareness. <br /> <br />There is also a pleasant current of practical advice. <br /> <br />I warmly recommend this book for a good read and re-read. <br />	2005-01-01

This book is full of gems that bring together brain physiology, psychology, Christianity and personal spirituality.  <br /> <br />     Pearce is well known from his earlier books about the magical child. Here, he writes of his personal spiritual development and of his views on the difference between transcendence and religion.   <br /> <br />     His personal experiences include periods during his life when he was able to activate intuitive/psychic abilities to scan masses of data accurately; to sell sterling silver to everyone (including an unscheduled, in-home sale at midnight); and impossible physical feats (e.g. climbing a high, crumbly cliff with an overhang). <br /> <br />     He points out that the need to honor, nurture and develop our transcendent awareness  is not a trivial or unimportant difference.   <br /> <br />     Pearce presents a strong case for interpreting the teachings of Christ in the light of personal spiritual development, rather than adherence to a ritualized liturgy. Pearce suggests that Christ's teachings were not intended to enthrone Jesus and the apostles, and certainly not the later established church, as the primary purveyors of spiritual wisdom, nor as the primary focus for spiritual observance. Christ taught that each of us has a direct connection to God. <br /> <br />     Pearce has a gift for reviewing diverse materials in an engaging manner. He includes a helpful discussion on the brain and transcendent awareness, but this is nowhere near as compelling as his discussions on spirituality.  This book is worth a good chew. <br />	2005-01-01

A gifted, natural healer from childhood, Coates was drawn to work with horses long before she had the means to do so. Her career in PR for a firm involved in equestrian products brought her into contact with many horses. Though she was successful in her work, and the primary wage earner in the family, she elected to study and practice healing and transitioned into this as her major occupation. <br /> <br />Coates found that she could mentally communicate with horses, who told her of their physical and emotional traumas and pains. She was able to relieve many of them through healing, with rapid - often immediate - changes in behaviours to validate that healing was effective.  <br /> <br />Her descriptions and explanations of her healings are helpful in understanding healing as a treatment in general. <br /> <br />This book is replete with explanations of various forms of healing, equine problems which have responded to healing, and further CAM approaches (acupuncture, craniosacral therapy) that can also be used for healing.  <br /> <br />What I found most interesting in this book are Coates' un-hyped descriptions of spiritual moments when she looked into particular horses' eyes and found herself transported into a timeless dimension. <br /> <br />This book is attractive as well as informative, a pleasure to hold in one's hands. <br />	2005-01-01

US	16711253	RLDOYREE3AGDF	1590560108	370299505	Therapeutic Touch As Transpersonal Healing	Books	5	13	14	N	N	Warmly recommended	Dolores Krieger takes several steps forward in this book.  She shares transpersonal aspects of healing that take TT beyond the mechanistic bioenergy model of simply assessing bioenergy fields that reflect physical and psychological problems, and adjusting bioenergy states through healer intent. Yet Krieger firmly grounds the transpersonal in theory and experiential explorations, with a strong focus on teaching in a responsible way. <br /> <br />Krieger presents lists of descriptors for various aspects of the TT experience that are helpful in dissecting and analyzing TT, but most of all - in appreciating its multi-faceted, multi-layered potentials for bringing the TT therapist  (Krieger uses this term instead of healer) through bioenergy interactions into ever greater awarenesses of the transpersonal dimensions of healing. <br /> <br />Discussions of the chakras (major bioenergy centers along the midline of the body) emphasize their transpersonal resonations with the cosmos, in addition to their regulation of localized body functions. Krieger strongly advises that a person should be helped to regulate her own chakras and that these centers should not be treated by the TT therapist. (In this, she differs substantively from practices common to many other healing approaches.) <br /> <br />Krieger has several earlier books on TT. This one takes the reader more deeply into the need to focus on the personal and spiritual development of the healer.  <br /> <br />The reviewer found this book more focused on transpersonal issues than Krieger's earlier ones and warmly recommends it to anyone wanting to learn about Therapeutic Touch. <br />	2005-01-01

Wanigi Waci offered classes to the hospital staff in cultural sensitivity, to help the conventional medical personnel appreciate the traditional ways of healing of his people. <br /> <br />Koerner's daughter, Kristi, nearly died in birthing her first child, requiring an emergency caesarian section. Her son nearly died of an infection due to the prolonged labor. He had repeated hospitalizations for respiratory infections during his first six months.  Kristi's second pregnancy was marked by diabetes, hypertension, toxemia and preeclampsia. In both childbirths, Wanigi Waci was present, unbidden, and enormously helpful with his Native American healing treatments. <br /> <br />Koerner went on to study and participate in the healing ceremonies of the Sioux. She shares from her many lessons of the heart and spirit, in a book that is hard to put down. <br /> <br />Koerner is clearly gifted as a nurse and as a teacher of the essence of nursing. She shares many insights around conventional and Native American healing. <br /> <br />Koerner's integrity as a healer who walks her talk is evident in the stories she shares about her healing journeys. What she writes of others is also true of herself. <br /> <br />Hopefully, Koerner's pioneering work with Wanigi Waci will open more nurses and hospitals to healing collaborations and spiritual lessons.  <br />	2005-01-01

Horgan is a skeptical mystic whose personal struggles with a wish to find a graspable truth is tempered by his theodicy - a difficulty in accepting that there could be a God who would allow the degrees of evil, suffering and pain that have been experienced in the world. <br /> <br />Horgan considers the perennial philosophy through an interview with Houston Smith, supplemented by Smith's writings and those of William James. Smith glories in the wisdom teachings of diverse traditions.  <br /> <br />Horgan's interview with Steven Katz a champion of postmodernism, is instructive in understanding the elusiveness of spiritual truths. Katz dismisses personal experiences as evidence for a mystical reality because all he can relate to are the descriptions of others about their mystical experiences - words that are derived from their expectations and cultural contexts. Katz comes up short in responding to Horgan's inquiry about his personal mystical experiences - minimizing this as of any real value. <br /> <br />Space does not permit detailed analyses of Horgan's enlightening interviews with Ken Wilber, one of the internationally acknowledged experts on Buddhist meditation and mysticism, Susan Blackmore, a skeptical UK parapsychologist; nor of many others interviewed; James Austin, a Zen Buddhist neurologist; Stanislav Grof (researcher), Terence McKenna (psychedelic author) and other explorers of entheogenic effects; and neurotheologist Andrew Newberg, who has mapped areas of the brain that become active during deep meditation. <br /> <br />Horgan's own spiritual search is a linking thread in his presentation, adding a pleasant tension to his thesis.  <br /> <br />This is an excellent consideration of an edifying spectrum of views, supported by well-researchednotes and references, very worth a thoughtful and deliberate read.  <br />	2005-01-01

Ric Masten, an author and poet, was diagnosed at age 69 with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that had already spread. He has had surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.  <br /> <br />Each writes of his experiences in his own way. Lachman presents linear descriptions and psychological analyses that are well organized and extremely helpful - as could only be written by someone who has both experienced dealing with cancer and has helped many others to deal with cancer. Masten wonderfully parallels all of the issues discussed by Lachman through poetry that is trenchantly honest, spoken from the heart, and yet maintains a centeredness that is utterly refreshing. Masten's poetry is on the even pages; Lachman's on the odd pages. It is utterly engaging to read of similar experiences that are shared in these two very different styles. In addition, each inserts meta-observations and comments in the margins about their own narratives and each other's.  <br /> <br />I found this book appealing not only for the contrasts and blends of presentations, but for the poetry of Masten itself, which I like and find to be moving, educational and enlightening.  <br /> <br />This excellent book is strongly recommended for people dealing with cancer themselves, or close to someone facing this challenge. <br />	2005-01-01

Cohen, also known as \\"Bear Hawk,\\" is an adopted member of the Cree Nation, and has studied with many medicine persons over four decades. This clear and lucid summary explains the medicine traditions and approaches of many of the Native American nations. <br /> <br />As Cohen explains, this book will not teach you to be a healer in this tradition because Native American healing is not learned from books. What it will do is to give you a breadth and depth of appreciation of the rich folklore that has much to offer those of us who are raised in the (relatively) sterile tradition of Western medicine which addresses the disease the person has, often ignoring the person who has the disease. The point is well made by Cohen that the person who is the healer, together with the person seeking the healing, shape and individualize the medicine that is needed for that specific healing. <br /> <br />Cohen writes with great wisdom and sensitivity, sharing his voluminous knowledge and many years of experience in studying and practicing Native American healing. He brings a lightness to this monumental work by sharing many personal stories of his encounters with the wise elders and healers of many Nations.  <br /> <br />This is a must read for anyone interested in shamanic traditions. <br />	2005-01-01

Of particular interest is a discussion of people who are densely insensitive to their bodies and to their mental and emotional connection with their bodies. Where many people who are suffering pain or other symptoms can productively answer the question, \\"What do you think/feel your body is saying?\\" these people may even be unaware of the possibility that their bodies may be symptomatic due to psychological tensions in their lives. When asked about factors that might contribute to their symptoms, they draw a complete blank. <br /> <br />The fact that their bodies are complaining about disharmonies in their lives may be grossly evident to caregivers, but it may be extremely difficult or impossible for caregivers to raise the body awareness of these people to a point that they can deal with their body problems in any way other than physical interventions. These people prefer medications and surgery - i.e. to have others \\"fix\\" them - rather than the spectrum of wholistic approaches that is the focus of the IJHC. <br /> <br />This suggests that people may self-select into treatment modalities that are consonant with their beliefs and awarenesses.  Counselors may be treating a very different population from those seen in a chirpractor's or acupuncturist's office - despite the fact that the symptoms presented by these populations may be similar. <br /> <br />Bakal has good discussions on a variety of interventions that help wholistically, addressing the meaning behind the symptoms. His approach is from the body side of the spectrum, rather than from the psychological side - which makes for interesting reading for those who are coming from the opposite side of this continuum. <br />	2005-01-01

Deena Spear completed her premedical studies in neurobiology but decided not to pursue a career as a physician. She unexpectedly found herself attracted to playing the violin (with very modest success), which led to a career as a luthier - building and repairing violins, violas and cellos with her teacher, who then became her husband. <br /> <br />Being something of a perfectionist, Deena was constantly seeking ways to improve the sound of the instruments they built and repaired. Through channeled guidance from master violin makers, she learned to shave minute bits from precise points on the instruments, significantly enhancing their sound.  <br /> <br />Deena was also drawn to spiritual healing and graduated from the four-year Barbara Brennan School of Healing course. Her two interests merged when she discovered that she could tune the instruments mentally. Conversely, her studies of how to tune the instruments mentally enhanced her confidence and skills in offering distant healing. <br /> <br />After honing her healing skills with the same diligence she had applied to studying to enhance the sound of violins, Deena started teaching others both of these skills. She finds that the tuning of violins gives people confidence in their abilities to influence matter at a distance, which then helps  them to believe they can send healing to people from a distance. <br />Deena's writing is punctuated with humorous observations and asides. Deena shares generously from her personal healing lessons. <br /> <br />Rarely do I find a book like this that is both rich in innovative lessons, reaffirming of healing wisdom and highly readable. I warmly recommend this book as being all of these. <br />	2005-01-01

Her father, a rabbi, was a tourist. He was targeted for reasons that were unknown. <br /> <br />Blumenfeld spent many months speaking with the family of the incarcerated terrorist, presenting herself as a journalist, which is in fact her actual occupation. She managed to communicate with the terrorist himself, as well.  <br /> <br />Though her father was able to forgive and release his attachment to the incident, Blumenfeld remained obsessed with the attack. She visited Albania, where revenge has been codified over 2,000 years of sanctioned practice; in Sicily, where the Mafia have established revenge as a tool for establishing and maintaining power; and in Iran, where Muslim tradition includes revenge as a part of its legal system. <br /> <br />Most fascinating to the reviewer, as a psychotherapist, is her personal odyssey of sorting out her relationships with her father and mother, and how this interdigitated with her resolution of her search for revenge. <br /> <br />This is an excellent, readable exploration of many facets of the issues surrounding vengeful feelings and their resolution. <br />	2004-10-31

One single concept, Xin (pronounced \\"shin\\"), embraces both. Confused Western translators have struggled with this, often translating Xin only as \\"heart\\" or only as \\"mind.\\" There is no heart and there is no mind, there is only Xin - HeartMind. <br /> <br />Many forms of qigong <br />   There are many variations on the theme of qigong.

Mills initially studied shamanic and Native American healing, then Reiki, and found that the healing would \\"turn on\\" automatically as she ministered to the women in labor and delivery at her hospital. This came naturally to her, as she describes herself as being a \\"hands-on\\" person, who intuitively comforts people with ordinary touch (in addition to touch required for medical examinations). Women who were in pain and who had difficult labors would find their problems rapidly eased with the healing. Being a physician, her observations on the effects of healing are more understandable and authoritative than most non-physician healing reports. <br /> <br />Second, Mills was a veterinarian prior to studying medicine, so she also shares reports of successful healing with animals. <br /> <br />Third, she has had the courage to speak openly to her colleagues and to write about her experiences. Her colleagues have responded with mixed reactions, ranging from warmly approving her use of a modality that markedly benefits her patients, through surprised questioning to learn more about healing, to questioning whether she should be doing this. <br /> <br />Fourth, she writes clearly and convincingly about approaches to using healing and its benefits.  <br /> <br />This book is warmly recommended to anyone interested in how healing can be integrated in a medical practice. <br />	2004-10-31

This is the intuitive, right-brained way our unconscious mind brings to our attention the rightness and wrongness of what we are doing; the itch that says (my words),  \\"examine what you are experiencing, because there is something out of harmony, out of alignment, misdirecting us from our proper life course.\\"  <br /> Gendlin teaches that  \\"the direction toward a felt sense is always into and through the feeling, never away from it.\\"  Feelings and emotions change only when we identify the felt sense associated with the feeling and seek out the roots behind this - for these are what anchor the feeling in our psyche and prevent its release.  <br /> Campbell and McMahon take Gendlin's work into spiritual dimensions.  <br /> Campbell considers prayers that substitute positive feelings for negative ones, such as anger. In a particular prayer he cites, whenever anger is felt, the love of Jesus is substituted for the anger.  <br /> They warn, however, that spirituality can function in the same way as any addictions, such as intoxicating substances, sex or work.  <br /> This classic has grown in popularity over time. I cannot recommend it highly enough. My only criticism is that this otherwise excellent book lacks an index. <br />	2004-10-11
