Nothing special about the binding, I don't think it could last more than 5 years with normal use.  <br /> <br />Patrick Marber is a novice play right but one with so much natural talent he seems like a seasoned pro at times. Dealer's choice has never been on my hit list but I have admired his rendition of Miss Julie in his After Miss Julie. Closer is the crown jewel of this collection. Witty and honest portray of how people choice to mess up their relationships. The book is in chronological order, going for his first play Dealers Choice to After Miss Julie then ending with Closer. If you read the book straight through you can see his writing style mature from dealer's choice and eventually peak in Closer. The intro and forward are nothing to brag about and might as well not be included. If you're looking to get this book cause you saw the movie version of closer then I recommend it. The movie is almost a exact replica of the play with just a few location changes and some scenes deleted. The character Alice isn't so sympathetic in the play but just as vulnerable and endearing.  <br /> <br />The material speaks for itself really. Patrick Marber is a brilliant playwright and I look forward to any future material he produces.	2005-01-07

Yes, it does have an awesome stretching routine, but that doesn't justify the price of this book. The weightlifting is nothing special, mainly dumbbell work and plyometrics. All the weightlifting info can be found free if you have access to the internet and an hour to kill. The stretching routine is mainly a gymnastics routine. Its main goal is enabling you to do the splits. If you go to your local library and pick up a book on gymnastics then you'll get a routine that is almost the same.  <br /> <br />All in all this is a well organized book with tons of detailed picture. It's a great book for the NOVICE WEIGHTLIFTER. My only suggestion is not to the 3 set of 12 reps for any given exercise. Do 2 set of 25 reps each and you'll have better results. You won't get as strong but you'll be stronger longer.  <br />	2004-10-23

THeir so redundent, you'd never know their were their till everything fubar's. The book is only 230 pages (not 400 like the spec's say) it is indepth at some but shallow at others. If that makes any sense. It's not a beginner's book, so it requires a basic intro understanding of dhcp and what it does. This is a great book if you want to know how to do your job, it gives you more information then you'll need, but isn't that the way it should be? :) I'm using it to help with that 70-216 but I'm not the type of person to read a book that is specifically meant for a test.

It has more information than you'll need for the test but just enough for the job. Humorus and witty writing that doesn't insult your intellegence like Mike Meyers' Passport's or bored and perplexed like Micro$oft. It has quite a few chapters devoted to Active Directory so it also makes a great introductory to the 70-217 (which you should pass before you take the 70-216, 70-216 is a killer). I don't know how it holds up to Server 2000 by Mark Minasi but it surpasses all the other books on server (and I've read them all). It's only has two faults. <br />One: It is not an introductory book, it require a fair amount of survey knowledge. I recommend Reading Sybex's 70-215 book first.<br />Two: Is that it was written just as 2000 came out and has yet to be updated (still contains practical knowledge). <br />If Boswell came out with a 2nd edition, I'd buy it full price and have it shipped overnight. But even as a 1st edition, it far out paces most server books that are even in their 3rd edition. You can't beat it a it's price.	2004-02-26

I'm a Network Administrator so I read as much if not more than a Medical Doctor (I know, I've argued with my family practioniar). This is simply the best book I've ever read on the subject. I've read serveral books that are no where descriptive or indepth as this one. It is the complete solution, other books only focus on one skill where this book cover them all.<BR>One thing I like to do that the book has left out is teach the table of contents. After I finish a book (usually a computer book) I go the table of contents and lecture to myself on each chapter and each important topic. It sound funny and you look stupid doing it, but if you can describe the what the chapter and topics are about than you know the book and subject. Some people like to do the index but that is a little extreme if taken to seriously. Yes it is time consuming but so is rereading. If you teach the table of contents, you'll not only know enough to pass the test, but you'll have the all important understanding of it (if you can explain it differently than the text book that is). And if you can't teach the table of contents than you know what you need to review. Of course this is just a tool to add to the tool chest he gives you. But i've found it highly effective.

He skims the surface of modern psychology (mostly Victor Frankl, everyone steals from Frankl) and passes it off as their own enlightened sense of well being and success. Yes he's living his dream. Why? Because his dream was to get rich by selling nothing. And that is what he's done, mooched of the idea's and theories of others that took them a lifetime to perfect, and he's packaged it and now he's selling it.

Their interests are to persuade the other party to invest in reproduction, while doing as little as they can themselves.\\" In Steve Jones opinion men are rapidly becoming obsolete. In plain words, Steve Jones imply's that all men are are walking erections that are trying to get as many partners as possible. Fertalization is the only thing that men have to offer according to him. I find that opinion funny because I remember my father working to support the family more than he spent impregnating my mother or other women. <BR>Steve Jones take a very simple philosophical answer and turns it into a genetics and evolutionary psychology arguement. There are Men and there are Boys. Same as there are Women and there are Girls. Everything in this book describes the average selfish teenage boy, but Steve Jones insist that Men are like this to. I'm offended by his attack on male masculienty. As is everything, when taken to extremes it is a negative, but it's very existence is positive. I can't even think straight because him. In Steve Jones's world it's perfectly okay to raise a child without a father. Ya sure it can be done, but that doesn't mean it ought to be done.

And I'm sure that he was the first person to pat himself on the back every time he accomplished something.

For a person with above average control and understanding of imagination and creativity, this is a sorry adaptation of `The Art of memory'. <BR>For the average person this is a great book. It helps build imaginative power and a little creativity as well. It describes that the best way to remember things is to build a mental image of interaction between the various facts you're required to remember. It recommends that the more ridiculous the image, the easier it is to remember which is true (and should only be applied in special situations), but if taken to seriously then with every new image you create you'll constantly be trying to `out-do' the previous image you created to remember something else. You'll be forced to imagine images that are so out landish that it'll cense to trigger your memory. That's how I see it and like everything in your life, a word of caution can be said that you shouldn't take it to seriously and try to remain grounded. This book takes no effort in helping you to understand what it is you're remembering. For the best I suppose because that isn't the purpose of the book (for an easy method of understanding, read my review of The Mind Map Book: How to Use Radiant Thinking to Maximize Your Brain's...). I do compliment them for their complete lack of fluff or Anthony Robbins b.s.. They are straight forward and don't attempt to sell you anything. They certainly don't try to motivate you or make you believe that all of life's problems can be solved if only you had a better memory. A great memory is a tool, not a solution for life. For the person with above average imaginative abilities you're better off reading the more in depth `Art of Memory' which is literary classic and is everything but a light read. The `Art of Memory' is far more complicated and in-depth in  it's description and style of memory techniques (better might I add). But to use `The Art of Memory' techniques requires a high amount of visual processing by the mind eye and a good deal of discipline, but worth it. It is not for the faint of heart. But if you're looking for a read that is quick and fast and has little or no historical back ground (not necessary a bad thing I'm only stating that facts), then this is your book. If you're a busy person and time is money, then this is your book. I do believe that the technique that is describes is the best. Everything else is probably new age [stuff]. Final analysis: All though weak in it's description of the technique in comparison with is predecessor, it's content is far more accurate and use ability than is peers. In short: the best of it's kind.	2003-07-27

It was on to something but fails to deliver. I'm a computer guy and I think that affects my opinion. What this book teaches if that you organize your brain or plan things with a tree structure and that you should use as many pictures as possible. You start with specific items. Say a book, them you make branches coming out describing different aspects. Then you have branch coming out of those branches describing those aspects in detail. Example of on branch: Book - Plot - Love Story - Body meets girl. And Etc. And every branch should be a different color that changes with each branch. 1st branch is red, 2nd is blue, 3rd is green. And use as many colors as possible. The theory of the colors and pictures are logical because of our visual minds. The branching is semi logical because it will only half work in half the occasions. It tries to get you to relate ideas and fact through the tree structure, but its' limitations is that those things can only relate through the other branches it is connected to. So if you're trying to relate something on the left to something on the right, then you're going to have to travel through each on the branches that connect them. That could be 8 or 10 branches to connect two thoughts. One of the easiest ways to remember (and understanding) something you're learning is to relate it to something that you already know (and understand). And with each new fact you relate to the previous fact and with anything else that it is relative to. Since everything is relative and everything in this world relates to everything else, it is a simple task to accomplish with your imagination. In my mind, all new knowledge I learn affects everything I already know. Everything mesh's and connects. Every neuron in your brain is connected to another but not in a tree structure like they're selling, but a fishing net. What they suggest is a Windows Explorer based mind with colors and fancy icons. It's a nice concept but too flawed tobe anywhere near a perfect system. Saves you're money, you'll spend more time on coloring and drawing than you will reading and learning. That's great if you're an artist but not for someone looking for straight answers. Read `The Memory Book' if you're average, but if you're imagination (not creativity mind you, there is a difference - imagination is to visualize and creativity is to create. It is possible to have more of one and almost none of the other) is advanced then read its' source of inspiration `The Art of Memory'.	2003-07-27

Anyone else will use it as a coaster. The character have no depth, the dialogue is contrived to the tenth degree, and like all his books, the ending is rushed. I love him but his ending rush to fast and he tries to make up for them by adding filling. He seems to give up interest by the end and just wants to end and get it over with.	2003-06-06

It will ruin you though. once you have finished it you'll kick yourself for the tenth of you're life you've spent watching the idiot box and you'll feel sorry for all those who continue to do so.

Is it martial arts that makes him feel good, or is it his obsessive blabbering about how great he is. the word conceded doesn't do it justice. I couldn't find one usefull fact in this book. A lot of hot air and Pseudo-Philosophical nonsense. He has no idea what he's talking about but he act like he does. He takes other's ideas and tweaks them a hair and thinks that he's just invented the wheel. I think everyone whose been burned by buying this book should chip in to buy him a wheel barrow so he can cart along that huge ego of his.<br />Read Bruce Lee: Words from a Master, you can get a used copy for a buck and is worth a million times more. Don't waste you like I did. Doesn't even make a good coaster to put your drink on.	2003-06-01

His book on the special forces was so in depth, it was almost to much information. This book was a waste of his time. he should have used his time better by writing a history book then this. He just did it for the money like all his fiction. If your a military nut who has fantasies of being a secret agent of being in special ops, then Tom clancy is for you. If you're a reader who wants a book that is believable and has well developed characters then stay away. But that really only is my compliant, the story and the character. The movies are awesome but the books [are bad] (never thought I'd say that). Read michael crichton.	2003-06-01

Nothing really original about this book. It's almost a survey class in time management. A lot of it was taken from Robert Covey's First things First. All he did was change the wording but the idea is still Robert Covey's. And there is an excessive amount of motivational fluff. Anyone whose read Tony Robbins know that motivational fluff only works till you put the book down. Read Seven habits of highly effective people, first things first, and unleashing the warrior within.	2003-06-01

I enjoyed reading it and it changed my perspective of the Nazis. It just proves my theory that this is what happens when you take yourself to seriously. It just amazes me that these were doctor and yet they still never used common sense.<br />As the narrative goes, it is well written and thought out. He interviewed numerous doctor and survivors and amassed a large enough fact to construct a clear recount of the concentration camps. At most though this is a history book and most defitinely not a psychology book. Yes the author makes evaluations and tries to explain but it is very poor. He'll state an event and then throw in his two sense about what was going on. Everything is objective till he expresses his opinion and then it becomes boring. He is jewish but that doesn't mean that he couldn't of written an objective account. He simple doesn't try. He acts like he is compeled to speak his mind, almost ruining the entire chapter you had just read.<br />I give him a five as a historian but a two in his opinions.	2003-05-12

After I read this book my whole perspective changed. You won't be able to look at you favorite war movies the same way after reading this book, but you'll understand the characters in movies like &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; a heck of a lot more. Even if you never have been or will never will join the military, it doesn't matter. This is a all around great book about the affects of killing people.	2003-03-17

If you understand and comprehened these principles then they will affect you and your daily life. It is invisible power and that which you can not see you can not fight. It these skills are aquired, let it be aid that with great power comes great responsibility and being able to attack someone with out them knowing is great power. Use it for good before using it for evil. <br />As long as teaching this is one of the better books I've read for those interested or moderately educated in such things.	2003-03-17

As a whole, its tools dddn't klump together, but individually the are awesome. The personal storie are informative and good for giving you a better idea of how to apply this tools. I disagree with the way he presents them, as though you could apply everyone of the tools in every situation. I believe like everything, there is a time and place for each of them. I recommend that you read this (make sure you understand and can apply it) then read Seven Habits of Highly Effective People and First Things First by Robert Covey.	2003-02-02
