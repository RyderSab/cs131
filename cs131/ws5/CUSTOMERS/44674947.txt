Just about everything that is presented as \\"evidence\\" is nothing more than OPINION AND/OR SPECULATION. How does the author get away with this? Well, without fail, at every opportunity, the author has to bring up the fact he was a cop with LAPD for 24 years and he ought to know, etc. <br /> <br />Long reviews are tough to get through and so I'll make this short. If George Hodel and his sidekick Fred Sexton were serial killers, as the author claims, my question is: when Hodel moved to Manilla and stayed there for forty years--did he continue killing? RE: Sexton: When he moved to Mexico: Did he go on killing? <br /> <br />This should be worth looking into. If they were serial killers, as Steven Hodel insists, the killing would not have stopped--because, you see, serial killers do not stop their murderous ways simply because they have relocated to another country.  <br />And, of course, if the slaughter did not go on, that could mean that the author was wrong in that aspect as well. <br /> <br />By all accounts, it seems a surgeon did the carving up...but is it possible that someone else did the actual killing? Say, someone mobbed up, a cop, or even one of those corrupt LA government officials at the time...and one of the doctors (part of the abortion ring operating under full protection of LAPD) did the final \\"cleaning up\\" of the body to rid it of any and all evidence?  <br /> <br />As others have pointed out, this won't be the last book on the subject. Perhaps, eventually, someone will come along and get the truth out. Beth Short is owed that much, at least. <br /> <br />	2005-08-30

I wish someone would make the effort to interview his lead actors to find out what they were paid for appearing in El Mariachi. What is the whole story? I get this feeling, outside of Rodriguez, his agent, the studio, and maybe Carlos Gallardo, (and perhaps his lawyer) noone else was paid much. <br />Exploitation? You figure it out. I don't claim to know, only asking some questions here. <br />If you went to some impoverished Mexican town and paid your actors peanuts & lunch, you just might be able to pull it off, too. <br />Also, if it's so easy to do--let the man do the same trick twice. (Well, it's 2005--give him twice the money, say 14 grand, & see what he does with it.) <br />Again, I don't claim to know that people were used and ripped off (because the book cleverly never mentions any of that at all, period. Nada.) Am only inquiring. After El Mariachi became the huge success that it was/is, were the people, the actors who helped make it a success (Peter Marquardt, Consuelo Gomez & the guy who played Azul) compensated? <br /> <br />What is the full and complete story, and not only Robert Rodriguez'es side of things?  <br />All we get in his book is his SIDE of this fairy tale.  <br />Yes, I enjoyed not only the book, but the movie as well--although I couldn't sit through Desperado or Once Upon A Time In Mexico. Why? Poorly written. Two dimensional characters. Hence, no one to give a damn about. Also: endless lightning quick-cuts and hundreds of people mindlessly shot up does not automatically translate into a good flick. Too many bullet hits and pretty soon boredom ensues. Too many grown men running around acting like juveniles  with guns and you've got what? Zip. A tiresome routine adding up to very little--if anything at all. <br /> <br /> <br />Mr. Rodriguez'es theory seems to be: keep cutting, keep shooting, keep it moving, & they  <br />won't mind that there is no real story there--will only fool some of the customers for a while...  <br /> <br />The otherthing that's annoying (usually) about Rodriguez'es commentary on his DVDs is his constant reminder how much money he saves the studios. Hey, it's old--and tiresome. Take a breath. We don't care. When you're spending thirty or forty  million to make a film--you are no longer makig \\"low-budget\\" movies, whether you try to make the claim or not. Doesn't matter if they're action flicks or not. <br />  Hire a writer who can write now and then. Also, leave the scoring to the pros with real talent. <br /> <br /> Found out that the reason he walked away from Zorro is because the film had been budgeted at 41 mil--and Mr. Rodriguez was asking for 42 mil. Huh? Say again? This from a man who likes to remind us (at every turn) what a low-budget genius he is. Something doesn't make sense here. He once made a film for (purportedly)  seven grand--why couldn't he make one for 41 million? <br /> <br />My take on why El Mariachi worked, at least one of the reasons: his lead Carlos Callardo. You believed him in the role. You believed he was just this good guy musician looking for work, trying to make some money playing his guitar. The reason Bandaras does not fit in the lead is because he comes across as this trigger-happy goof-ball ready and willing to shoot it out at the slightest reason. Makes no sense--and not only hurt the series, but made it unwachable. <br /> <br />The other thing that's hard to take in these flicks is all the phony computer generated special effects. I wish filmmakers would wake the hell up. The stuff looks fake. Fake. Get it? No good. We can tell. You're not fooling anyone.  <br /> <br />Can you honestly blame me  for asking some of these questions and/or bringing certain things up in this review? After all, we've been hearing & HEARING  about the \\"$7,000\\" it took to make El Mariachi for fifteen loooong years now. <br /> <br />What is the WHOLE story?	2005-06-09

I mean, look at him. What do you see? Just another confused, flawed human being trying to get through this thing called life & doing the best that he can. <br />Why was he idolized? Why put anyone on a pedestal? I don't get it. <br />I never even payed much attention to his art until Time Out Of Mind (which, in my humble opinion, is terrific, no matter what Dylan himself says about it or what others even say about it). I like the music & the lyrics are easy to relate to. Most of all, I love his craggy/raspy way of singing on this record. Makes it all more believable and heartfelt. The Time Out Of Mind record made me want to check out some of his other tunes & was pleasantly surprised. One other favorite CD is The Essential Bob Dylan.  <br /> <br />Because I like the music, does that now mean that I worship the ground he walks on? I don't think so. I like Roy Orbison's singing a lot more and I never idolized the Big O; like Janis Joplin's way of belting out a song & never felt she was some sort of all-knowing supernatural being either, etc., That's my two cents. <br /> <br />RE: Knockin' On Heaven's Door.  A moving piece of work; on the other hand, the Hurricane Carter tune (although sounds good and is well written) is missguided. Why? All one has to do is read up on Carter to see the truth. Guy was no angel. Who is? My point for bringing this up? Just further proof that Dylan is like everyone else, and like everyone else has his weaknesses and lapses in judgement. <br /> <br /> To be fair, I haven't read Chronicles Vol. 1, but have read the Newsweek article, as well as the excerpt from Dylan's book--and found both worthwhile. <br />I also believe this was a good idea, on Mr. Dylan's part, to get his own thoughts down on things, instead of having his life and music misinterpreted by \\"professional\\" critics, as they have done over the years.  <br />I'll read the rest of the tome--as soon as my local library gets it.	2004-10-07

Because Getz was some kind of sax playing genius, in my opinion...and we always wonder what our favorite artists were like away from the stage. Well, sadly (& maybe not so sadly, depends how you look at it), you get it here.     The trick is, once you have put the book away, to forget the negative and return to the music, appreciate the artist's art. Not always easy to do--but we do it. His art endures. You just wish he and his first wife (both junkies at one time) had been better parents to their kids, etc.     So then, was Getz a total lost cause? Of course not. He had his decent side--although when messed up on booze and/or drugs he was not pleasant to be around, to put it mildly.    Guy had demons, to be sure. Am talking about suicide attempts and  depression. But then, how many of us haven't gone through a thing or two? It happens.      Don't know if this can be called the definitive bio on Stan the Man, but it is certainly worth reading.     Be warned, though, the last third is a heartbreaker. Just finished reading the entire thing. I'd like to give this tome 4 stars, instead of the three shown above, but (for some reason) amazon doesn't make it possible to change the rating.     I'm glad this biography was written.	2004-09-21

That deep down, in her heart and soul, she turns out to be monogamous and has finally settled down with a decent guy.<BR>Yes, she was always a looker, hot, not a great beauty, per se, but put it all together and, man, she had it. I can't even put my finger on it exactly...maybe a Sophia Loren type...<BR>Maybe some other guys out there were like me, found her incredibly attractive, but always wondered what this person was like; was she human at all? Was she capable of being with just one guy, all that. And the answer to that question, and many others, is in this book.<br />Troubled childhood? You better believe it. On her own before she turned eighteen. Lived through her share of hard times. Some of it sad enough to almost bring tears to your eyes, and some of it is hilarious enough to actually do exactly that: bring tears to your eyes.<br />It's worth reading...and, in my opinion, would make one hell of a motion picture.<br />So why then, after all this praise, would I not give our Christy five stars? Here it is: (and it can easily be corrected) punctuation throughout this edition is off; commas are missing and there are typos that can easily be taken care of.<BR>First couple of pages (title page, etc.) also should be re-done so that it does not look like a self-published book).<br />A professional editor could take care of  this without breaking a sweat. It really would be worth it, Christy--because you have one hell of a story here. And don't worry, it'll still be your book, your writing, your baby.

It is not written for men (in order to know more about pleasing women) but, instead,  written by a lesbian  for other lesbians, etc., but the book cover and copy try to make it look like it was written for both: men AND women. In other words: it's bogus. The pulisher is trying to have it both ways in order to sell more copies of the book.<BR>My advice? Don't waste your money like I did.

Where the tale bogs down is during all the court proceedings (some, to be sure, was needed and rather moving: am talking about testimony of those related to various victims lost in fires set by psychopath John Leonard Orr). I am sure, going in, that Mr. Wambaugh was perceptive enough to know that this is where the story slows down and nearly puts the reader to sleep. Again, no fault of his, etc. Although never a great stylist, Joseph Wambaugh can present a nail-biter when he has one to tell (see Onion Field, etc.) The other section here that keeps one on edge is where retired Burbank firefighter Steve Patterson does his utmost to try and unravel the mysterious death of Mary Duggan... I won't go into detail here; it wouldn't be fair...but all I will say is we are grateful for decent-hearted individuals like Mr. Patterson and so many prosecutors and hard-working, dilligent cops who did their best to bring this heartless (and yes, murdering--those victims died in fires he set) serial arsonist named John Leonard Orr to face the music. What is frustrating here is that, ultimately, he was not forced to pay a high enough price. This guy is about as pathetic and cowardly a weasel as you will ever read about. He never owned up, never showed remorse, never said to the familes he wrecked and left in so much pain: I'm sorry. Never, not once.

The other thing that bugged me, and it's fairly minor, some of the chapters are in white lettering on black background, etc. and makes it hard to read--but not the entire book is this way so don't worry. get the book for the information to be GLEANED and you can make any type of low-budget film you wish. <br />bottom line: terrific book by Lloyd Kaufman and his cohorts, even though the guy makes schlock. worth the money for the information. FUN AND ENTERTAINING. CHEAPER THAN FILM SCHOOL.	2003-06-12

The coroner's photos might turn your stomach--as they did mine. Well written. You get to see and know what this woman was about. It's true: she was a good-time girl; still, what a way to go. Nobody should have to die the way she did.   As far as  who did her in?--the author seems to have a fairly compelling idea...and yet, the truth is there never was/is any actual evidence to prove that the suspect who died in that fleabag fire was the actual killer. Then again--who knows?   What is  difficult to accept is the disappearance of the taped conversations the author had with suspect Jack Anderson Wilson once they were turned over to the LAPD. Too convenient. After all the years of working on the book and finally, at long last, meeting up with a potential suspect, didn't it occur to the author to make duplicates of his recorded conversations with the possible murderer before turning his sole evidence over to the poice? I don't get it. John Gilmore does not strike me as a dumb individual, and yet without these tapes, without anyone else, other than Gilmore, to claim they ever existed--Mr. Gilmore hasn't got much.  So who killed Elizabeth Short? A member of the LAPD? Someone connected? One of Tinseltown's High and Mighty? In this reader's opinion, the answer is not conclusive.     Still, I say this is the type of true crime book that could easily cause you to have nightmares. Read at your own risk. You have been warned.	2003-05-22

Cover up the less than pleasant parts of his subject's background? I think not. It's a facinating tale that will haunt you long after you have finished the book. Extremely well done; unputdownable. If you're interested in low-budget filmmaking and appreciate what these filmmakers have to go through to make their dreams happen on zero budgets...this is the book for you. The other would be on Al Adamson, and, of course, Ed Wood.	2003-05-22

Speaking of the truth--you won't find it here. I don't know the woman, never met Eastwood either--but I'll say this much: it seems to me the whole time she was with the guy she was on a gravy train--because had she not been his girlfriend for the thirteen years she was with him there is no way she would have appeared in so many of his films. that was usually the thing that bugged me about the films Eastwood made during that period: the fact that Sondra Locke was in them.<br />listen, no one ever accused East wood of being some great actor--and he never will be, however, having said that, there is no denying that he has fashioned a certain screen presence that works for him--as well as for audiances over the years--and because Sondra Locke was with him, she benefitted, etc. for a while anyway.<br />I don't know, for me, bottom line here is this lady comes across as bitter and this book seems nothing more than a feeble stab at revenge for having been dumped by the star.<br />Hey, life goes on. Glad Eastwood has finally married a good woman.	2003-05-13

Don't know what the other reviewer is complaining about. I paid full price and don't regret it. (That's about eighteen bucks,  with shipping.)<br />If you like Buddy's kind of music, you'll appreciate the book. In addition: you get plenty of insight into the man, what for me, was an added bonus: Buddy's devotion to friends and good-hearted nature (ie: the passage with Johnny Carson, Count Bassie, et al). Granted, he wasn't always the easiest guy to get along with, but what matters most is that he had a good heart, loved music and those who had the same love and dedication for it as he did.  Reading the book made me want to take the albums out and play them, etc.<br /> While I'm at it here, have wanted to express for years now how impressed I was with his daughter Cathy's version of the Sonny Bono tune entitled THE BEAT GOES ON. She does a terririfc cover of it on Buddy's Big Swing Face album recorded years ago. Cathy was only 12 and 1/2, mind you, at the time, and showed great promise in my opinion, and have wondered why she never pursued a singing career, etc.<br />There is so much more I could say about this book, but it would take too long. You get a good glimpse into what life must have been like for Buddy and his family in this country during the 30's and 40's, etc.,  (through various interviews with family members),  what it was like for him as a gifted kid at age 3 to be traveling the world as &quot;Traps the Drum Wonder,&quot; all that.<br />The only thing that bothered me (and this is a relatively minor objection, if you can even call it that) is the awful photo of Buddy Rich used for the cover, as someone else mentioned as well. I mean, couldn't  they have found  something more flattering? I think the legendary Buddy Rich deserves better.<br />All in all: nice job, Mr. Minahan. Thank you.	2003-05-13

Writing by the numbers is the worst way to write anything. I'd like to see a screnplay that this guy has written (if he is even capable of it) before I take his advice. Do you see what I'm getting here? He can't write a screenplay, but he can give others advice on how to do it. Huh?  Run that by me again. Actually, it's not that difficult to figure out: since he can't write a screenplay he has, however, devised a way to make money writing these how-to books--and lots of it. Fine, for him--but not so good for you, because this is advice coming from someone without credentials. If Sam Fuller or John Huston were giving advice on screenwriting (or, say , Akira Kurosawa,) that would be well and good. But no, it's this guy who hasn't got the talent to do it.	2003-01-02

Considering that, how can anyone take this guy seriously? This type of so-called advice will only fill your head with bad ideas and ruin you for years to come. Instead, I suggest, you look up writer/directors like Joe Carnahan and find out how they did it and what they have to say. Listen to talented and accomplished filmmakers who are actually doing it (and then devise your own system), but stay away from guys like Syd Field who has never written anything that was produced. I truly believe this guy's misguided advice will only derail and hurt the novice movie writer.	2003-01-02

First of all, you have got to ask yourself what has this guy written that was ever produced? You got it. This is like all those teachers of writing who have never ever written a novel that went anywhere.<BR>My advice is: read some good screenplays and look at some great films and then spend some time thinking about it all: What makes them work? Why do you like them? You might also take a look at a few awful flicks to see why they're awful. <BR>The thing you must keep in mind when writing for the screen (it's no different from writing a short story or novel) there must be a compelling tale that you are aching to tell, etc. you need strong characters and don't go overboard with a whole lot of dialogue. Also: a page of script equals a minute of scren time. That's about it. And, oh yeah, re-writing takes work and patience and diligence. If you're dedicated and have a strong story to get out there and stay with it you'll probably succeed. Only don't throw your money away on these how-to books, because they will only screw your head  up (and it may take years to un-do all the damage). The writer Joseph Wambough of the excellently written and directed THE ONION FIELD and THE BLACK MARBLE said it best: screenwriting is story-telling.	2003-01-02

I'm not at all sure that it's Ferguson's fault. I wanted to know what Hamsun's mindset was at the time of struggling through his masterpieces like Hunger and Pan and Victoria, I wanted to be able to get inside the great writer's mind...and it just can't be, because the author of this bio wasn't there. If you want psychological insights and great writing you must go to the source: Hamsun's own novels. Yes, you'll get  dates and details here in Enigma, but that does not make for interesting and/or engaging reading. I was disappointed. The gifted, self-taught Knut Hamsun remains a favorite, though.

I hope the male readers aren't put off by the title (because this novel is for both sexes.) I guarantee you both men and women will be able to relate (if you have ever been burned by love). The author goes for psychological insights and the book will stay with you for years for this reason. A sad and incredible tale, reads like non-fiction torn from today's headlines. What a motion picture this would make, on second thought, maybe Hollywood ought to keep away, as they, more than likely, would ruin it. Five stars easy. The damn thing left me in tears. Not an easy thing for a straight male to admit, not to mention it also helped me get over a bad love affair. If you've loved and lost you know that's something that can easily push you over the edge. If you happen to be going through something like that at the moment, I suggest you read the book and it just might keep you from doing anything stupid.	2003-01-01

Nat West was in a different league as a writer, much higher on the scale, etc., but that shouldn't keep you from enjoying McCoy's take on LA LA. <BR>I'm a McCoy fan from way back, and what's sad is there you are wanting him to be as good as West or Hemingway or Hammet, et al, as a writer, and there is just no way. Don't get me wrong, McCoy does the best that he can with the gifts that he had...and one simply has to settle for it. What may have hurt him as a writer early on is the fact he wrote for the pulps...but then again so did Raymond Chandler and he didn't end up anything less than a first rate type of novelist--even though he worked in the private ... genre.<br />Bottom line: Enjoy McCoy for what he has to offer--and what he's got to offer isn't all that bad either. An easy read and a cautionary tale: It's okay to have dreams, but don't throw your life away chasing after something that isn't likely to happen. And yet, we can relate: who hasn't got a dream or two they would like to see happen? It's part of being human. Horace McCoy never made it as an actor in real life, the reason he came out to Hollywood in the first place, but he did end up working on over one hundred B-flicks as a screenwriter. With that many credits to his name one imagines the man was able to make a decent living, that's a lot better than the thousands of other lost dreamers roaming the streets of The Glitter Factory. Four stars is a fair appraisal. We remain a McCoy fan.	2003-01-01

Maybe 5 to 10 percent has merit and is worth reading--and the rest? Babble, gibberish, flat. Mind you, this is not easy for a Buk fan to admit--but the way it is. I bought it cheap so I don't really regret getting it. But if you're looking for great writing, great poetry you won't find it here.<br />If you're looking for excellent Buk prose try Notes of a Dirty Old Man, Erections, Ejaculations, Exhibitions and General Tales of Ordinary Madness (broken down into two volumes and titled something else, from City Lights) Factotum, South of No North--even Hollywood. Living On Luck worked for me as well, so did Screams From the Balcony (letter collections, etc.) As far as his poetry? As someone else stated: the early or middle stuff. Septuagenerian Stew (stories and poems) isn't very good either. Could be one reason why Martin decided to sell the store.<br />The problem with Buk's later stuff is just this, I believe, he liked to say that writing was too easy for him, that there was nothing to it--and that what he produced was all good stuff. Well, as any writer knows, if it's that easy and you think everything you write is terrific, it very often means just the opposite.<br /> I believe his publisher continued to publish the Buk's stuff because he was THE BUK, and we understand that.<br />My conclusion regarding Bukowski's work is just this: a third of his output is truly great and original, a third is fair--and the rest is blatantly bad, just too awaful to have any meaning or worth reading. And yet, having said that, as terrible as it may sound to the diehard Buk fan, I maintain it is a great compliment to the man, because the third that is good will forever keep him up there at the very top of the best writers ever. So, please don't despair because not everything he wrote isn't gold--it can't be. Nobody is that good; nobody can be. Buk was human and had his limitations.	2002-12-18

Smooth and truly professional. <BR>While Buk was alive he liked to poke fun at The Beats (he liked to put down Kerouac's writing, as well as Burrough's--well, the truth is On The road is a well-written novel and a modern classic, and the same could be said of Burrough's Junkie. So here, within these pages, you get to know something about The Beats--if you're new to all this. Worth buying for your library, even though the Buk interview  also appears in the Daniel Weizman tome Drinking With Bukowski.  Thanks to all involved!  <br />Lastly, I found out recently that John Martin (Buk's publisher)<BR>sold Black Sparrow Press...am still reeling from the shock...but then I thought what a terrific book idea, to have Martin write a book ( or have someone else do it for him) all about Black Sparrow, how it got started, how he met Bukowski and made it  happen. That would complete the entire picture. People like myself would be interested in reading a book of this type.

It is obvious that lots of love went into putting this book together, from the exceptional cover photos (the one of Buk is one of the best ever!), design as well as what's inside. Credit also goes, of course, to the author: Jean-Francois Duval. Written in French and translated--although it does not read like a tranlation; it is that well done. Smooth and truly professional. <BR>While Buk was alive he liked to poke fun at The Beats (he liked to put down Kerouac's writing, as well as Burrough's--well, the truth is On The road is a well-written novel and a modern classic, and the same could be said of Burrough's Junkie. So here, within these pages, you get to know something about The Beats--if you're new to all this. Worth buying for your library, even though the Buk interview  also appears in the Daniel Weizman tome Drinking With Bukowski.  Thanks to all involved!  <br />Lastly, I found out recently that John Martin (Buk's publisher)<BR>sold Black Sparrow Press...am still reeling from the shock...but then I thought what a terrific book idea, to have Martin write a book ( or have someone else do it for him) all about Black Sparrow, how it got started, how he met Bukowski and made it  happen. That would complete the entire picture. People like myself would be interested in reading a book of this type. John Martin, to me at least, has always appeared to be this mysterious figure in the background, behind Buk's success...and I, for one, would love to know how  Martin and his wife  made it all happen: the early struggles, and finally the acclaim, success; all of it.<BR>How about it, John?

He was never seperated from his family, in fact the very peasants/villagers he slanders and makes to appear bad saved not only his life, but the rest of his family. Why the big stink over Kosinski now (for the past ten years actually) is because the guy always insisted that this stuff was all true and that he had lived through it. The man &quot;borrowed&quot; passages from other writers' works and reworked them as his own and made them part of his books. Another example is Being There--&quot;borrowed&quot; from The Career of Nikodem Dyzma, etc. Kosinski, it seems, was a decent idea man, but the writing was done by others. None would begrudge a writer using proofers, they all do it, Hemingway, Thomas Wolf, all of them (nothing wrong with that. A writer can be a fine storyteller, but lousy at spelling, as well as unable to see his own mistakes, errors, etc. So this is acceptable...) but this guy Kosinski sems to have gone way beyond that. Read James Park Sloan's biography if you need more facts--although Sloan is not a great writer himself (the book is flat) but entails plenty of facts). Kosinsky, no doubt, was a troubled guy, a mess, scarred--and his primary goal once he got to New York was to become a success--at any cost. And in the end, it cost him his life. Perhaps if he had taken the time to learn the craft of storytelling...it may have worked out better for him...but even there raw talent is required and the ability to beat the language (not your own) one has chosen to write in. Quite a task--and Kosinski knew he was not up to the task. His way of getting over that obstacle was to employ others to do the actual writing. Are we saying here that the guy was totally worthless as a human being? No, we're not. Are we saying that the man hadn't suffered and been put through plenty psychologically during WWII? Of course not. All we're saying here is that hisfacade of the great writer was just that: a facade. A con job, that made him famous and paid him plenty--but also helped destroy him when his luck ran out in the end. In a perfect and fair world the Oscar for Being There would have gone  (if posthumously) to the author of The Career of Nikodem Dyzma for having created the original book the movie was based on, etc. <BR>Kosinski hungered for the brass ring at any price...  James M. Cain in his Double Indemnity gave us fair warning about that:  Careful  what you wish for.	2002-10-30

Cooper was as good as Hemingway or Mailer (or any of those white cats--and this is coming from a white cat), but due to his skin color and the times and what he wrote about the recognition wasn't forthcoming. It's sad. It tears you up inside. He shouldn't have died broke and a failure--because he was not a failure. The man had talent to spare. The writing is not only raw, but it is literature as art. Another overlooked African-American genius. I just don't get it, don't understand it. But why should that surprise me about people?

Never read anything else by Orwell (not sure why), but the writing here is easy and unpretentious. Easy to relate as well, if you've ever been down and out, scraping bottom, desperate to make bills, etc. I read somewhere that Ernest Hemingway thought this was a terrific book (& that's high praise, I think). The writing here reminds me of Nelson Algren, Dan Fante's Spitting Off Tall Buildings, Charles Bukowski's Factotum, Kirk Alex'es Working the Hard Side of the Street, and some of the late John fante's novels--but keep in mind Mr. Orwell stays clear of sex and foul language, not that sex or foul language in a book ever bothered me (it all depends on the writer's style of putting the word down, etc.) In Orwell's case it just wasn't his way of doing things; plus you've got to remember this book was written way back in 1933--and yet, still holds up today! That tells you plenty. This is a fine work , a gem of a book.	2002-10-30

Nelson Algren is at the very top of the heap: original, compassionate, funny, insightful. You know, we read many books, and once we have finished with the book we toss it aside and forget about it. With Algren it's different. You read his stuff and can't help feeling cheated at not having known the man, not having ever had a chance to meet the guy. Wish there was a way to sit down and have a beer with the man, light up a stogie and have a good chat with the genius who created this masterful story collection. The writing is gritty and true, heartfelt. Brings to mind several other writers who had this knack of writing in this kind of honest, unflinching style: John O'Brien (Leaving Las Vegas), B. Traven (take your pick: Treasure of Sierra Madre, Cottonpickers, etc.) Knut Hamsun (Hunger), Eugene O'Neill (Long Day's Journey Into Night), Celine (Journey to the End of the Night), Kirk Alex (Working the Hard Side of the Street), Chester Himes (If He Hollers Let Him Go).<BR> All of the above had their own style, of course, but the thing they had in common was in the balls they showed by not flinching away from the gritty, life lived by so many who weren't born with deep pockets, who didn't have it easy. <br />Writing from the gut. Algren lives. Read THE NEON WILDERNESS, and give some of the others a try as well. <BR>This is writing for people who love books and love to read.

Basically the man, \\"Kosinski,\\" was illiterate--and yet, for a while there, he was teaching at a coupleof first rate universities. You figure it out.

In the final analysis, this was Kosinski's greatest talent: lies and ... The man couldn't even write a decent letter...this explains why, years ago, when I attempted to read a couple of his novels I simply could not get through them...and I could not pinpoint exactly what it was that these books were lacking. Of course, now we know: too many chefs had had a hand in Jerzy's stew.<br />As far as this Sloan guy goes: he tried, but this isn't the definitive book on Kosinski (a worthwhile subject for a biography by someone who can write, even if his books are unreadable).	2002-10-26

Terrific read. Just thinking about it makes me want to buy another copy (I lost the first one somewhere) for a second reading. Genre novels of this caliber are few and far between.

The author, Bukowski, barely holding on by his fingertips (before he started to make any money with his literary eforts.) Highly recommend it to anyone who preffers the real to the slickly put together phony books out there by so-called writers being published by the bloated, greedy East Coast houses who don't know what the hell they're doing. Why so harsh? Because I don't see any originality in books put out by them, that's why. How can that be? Ask them. In their desperate, stupid efforts to make every book a sure-fire best-seller they put editors on it who beat all originality right out of these manuscripts. Thus, usually, we are left with unreadable garbage lacking real style and/or originality. And Bukowski? Well, the reason Black sparrow took him on is because his writing was not about that phony slickness that so often New York publishers seem to want and pay the big bucks for (only to fall on their butts--more often than not). Bukowski's style brings to mind another writer or two: Kirk Alex (Working the Hard Side of the Street), Dan Fante: Mooch, Spitting off Tall Buildings, etc. Buy it, read it, and find out what life was like for the man who brought you Post Office, Hollywood, and other masterpieces before the well-earned rocognition towards the latter part of his life.

Forget Shakespeare (and all the others), with the exception of August Strindburg (for those who do not know, Strindburg was a hero of ONeill's, etc. although O'Neill, obviously went on to develope a voice all his own). When it comes to Eugene O'Neill you can either read his plays or watch them performed to get the impact--and I guarantee you, you will be impacted. When I first read this play ( twenty some years ago) it felt like I'd been punched in the stomach by a heavyweight. This man's life was turbulent, to be sure, plenty of pain and grief and sorrow--and he dealt with it by writing plays about it. Who can't relate to that? Read it, read all of Eugene O'Neill, America's greatest genius of the stage.	2002-07-10

It's all here. While you appreciate the guy's honesty (and love him for it) you can't help but shake your head and feel so damn sad and awful at the hell he put himself through with all the drugs he shot up/used/consumed... Why?  Why did he have to go that route? I'm not judging here; we all have our weaknesses, but you can't help but feel shocked at the toll all the smack he shot up took on this guy (you have never met, but feel that you know and give a damn about the same way you would any friend.)  I also recommend the video. There is a scene there in the third act, where Art is playing a tune called Our Song on his record player (with his wife Laurie sitting also nearby listening to this beautiful piece of music that he had written for her, for the love that he felt for his lady) and Art is saying: \\"That's it; that's the best that I can do. It took 51 years to be able to do that...\\" And I have to tell you it hit me pretty hard as I sat in front of my set watching/listening to this music that Art had created... Art Pepper, an original. I wish he were around. Yeah, I know, there's the music he left behind...it isn't enough. I miss the guy, even though I never met him. I have a feeling you'll feel the same way after reading Straight Life.	2002-06-07

He was smart to stay clear of  Hollywood's phonies and neurotics (with the exception of writing Barfly for the big screen). See the flick by the way, doubt you'll be disappointed--unless you've got a bit too much starch in your white collar. Buk wrote about blue collar down-and-outers like himself, and did it with a uniqueness and originality all his own.	2002-05-29

Like a volcano, Himes had to let it out or go nuts. He was as good as Hemingway (or any of those white cats at the time) and simply was not given the respect because of his skin color.<BR>It's a damn shame. And I'm saying this as a white guy who happens to be color-blind, as they say. Himes did end up moving to Europe where he was better treated. <BR>Lastly, all I can say is once I started reading If He Hollers...<BR>I could not put it down and finished it in two days--my eyes aching and all. If you're looking for the real thing, this is it.<BR>Tough writing is not easy to find these days, writing that's from the gut and is about something... This book has it. Long live Chester Himes.	2002-05-29

The author missed a great chance to get inside the artist's head--but then again, he probably did not have this kind of access to Baker, etc., did not truly know him that well and was not able to spend the kind of time with him that would have required it. Too many things are glossed over here: Baker's childhood, not to mention the times he was forced to work dead-end, low-paying jobs because he was in too sorry shape to play the horn (for one reason or another, etc.). Plenty was left out, but then you also get the feeling that was not the type of book this writer set out to do...who knows? I still recommend it, though. Because I knew nothing about Baker (other than the fact I liked his music and style of playing the horn) until I read this book . I'll probably look for other books on the jazz great with (hopefully) more depth to them. I suppose I'm like so many other fans out there who are interested in finding out what their favorite painters/musicians/writers' lives were like... It's worth the money and will probably make you want to go out and buy a Chet Baker CD or two.	2002-05-29

I have read all the greats out there: Charles Bukowski, James M. Cain, Chandler, Hammet, Hemingway, Orwell, Jim Thompson, Clarence Cooper, Jr., Iceberg Slim, John and Dan Fante, Donald Goines, Joseph Conrad, B. Traven, Jack London, Albert Camus, Knut Hamsun...and this guy, James Ross, with his one and only book is right up there at the very top of the heap with the best of the best. You won't find better writing anywhere...and it's not so much the story even, but what he does with it. Ross uses a deceptively easy-going, simple style that sort of sneaks up on your psyche and leaves a mark long after you have finished his tale. A remarkable work; a certified classic in my humble opinion. Highly recommend it to anyone who likes a solid read.	2002-02-20

I've always gone for writers who had to come up the hard way, had their ups and downs, never had it easy, never had anything handed to them on a silver platter, so Gilb is somebody I would like right off the bat. I admire the man's accomplishments. There's no trickery here. Gilb takes his time and tells his tale in his own, unique style. I also read THE MAGIC OF BLOOD and liked that as well. Looking forward to other works by this fine writer. I gave it five stars .	2001-12-28

I don't ordinarily go for poetry (with a few exceptions: Charles Bukowski, Pleasant Gehman, Bill Shields, Dan Fante, Jim Northrup, Jack Micheline, etc.) so it's rare for me to spend money on a poetry book--but when I do, it's usually something worthwhile--and this certainly is that: a gem of a book. I'd like to see Suzanne Lummis write more. The lady has paid her dues and it shows. I don't recommend everything I read--but this is certainly a book I would recommend. Too bad it's such a slim volume. There's an old saying, though: good things come in small packages--and Suzanne Loomis' IN DANGER is certainly one of those good things. I had to give it five stars. Also, that was a moving obit the lady wrote in the L.A. Times a few years back when the late great Charles Bukowski passed on. The piece was so well done that I had to cut it out and frame it. I don't know, I'm sure others have felt this way, but there they were: tears rolling down my face when I heard that Buk was no longer with us. Thank you, Suzanne Lummis.	2001-12-28

I don't agree with him at all, and neither does Karl S. Guthke, that someone else wrote all those B. Traven books. Yes, Traven must have had some help (so did Hemingway and Thomas Wolf--as did so many others) --that still does not prove that he was not the original author. The man was clearly highly intelligent as well as obviously quite articulate. All one has to do is go over some of his correspondence with various entities throughout his career. To simply say that a writer can't write in more than one style is ridiculous. Mr. Baumann's theory remains nothing but that--a theory. I get the feeling that &quot;B. Traven&quot; did write his books himself and that Mr. Baumann does not even come close to proving otherwise.<BR>Now, as to who B. Traven actually was--well, that's something else<BR>again, entirely different issue. Yes, we know he was Hal Croves and that he was also Ret Marut (among other aliases that he had in his little I.D. kit)<br />but no one, nobody has yet been able to figure out who Ret Marut was or where he came from, not Judy Stone, not Karl Guthke or anyone else. Yes, they have tried...and failed. Maybe one day someone will come along and offer up solid proof as to the real and true identity of this talented writer...maybe...or it could be that anyone who may have had the answer has probably by now passed on, etc. Meanwhile, we have the B. Traven books. I have already read THE COTTONPICKERS and liked it (reminded me, to some extent, of DOWN AND OUT IN PARIS AND LONDON by Goerge Orwell, as well FACTOTUM by the<BR>great Charles Bukowski).; read TREASURE (also well done) and am in the process of reading THE DEATH SHIP...<BR>And so, my final verdict RE: MR. TRAVEN, I PRESUME? Close, but no cigar, Mr. Baumann. Keep trying...or rather, accept the fact this is just another one of life's mysteries we'll have to live with.	2001-09-07

It was written by the same talented writer who wrote Treasure of the Sierra Madre. You won't be disappointed. Traven delivers. Easy read. I read it in a day. The man is always for the underdog--who can't relate to that? The only thing that bothers me at times is Traven's political [views]. Man obviously had an ax to grind--well, ok, I suppose, everyone has an ax to grind about something. But when it comes to poltics and religion--well, two subjects that just sicken me--because you can never get anywhere with that stuff. You can talk about that b.s. until you're blue in the face and still end up nowhere.<br />Other than that--yes, I highly recommend the book.	2001-09-07

I had read some of Donald Goines' books more than a decade ago (when I could find them) and thought they were brutal, but truthful--and that's what we want from our literature, at least I do; I like the truth and stay clear of b.s. I'm a white dude by the way, and to me skin color does not matter; what matters is the quality of the writing, the quality of the art--and Donald Goines had it and Mr. Stone has it. I always wondered about the author of Dopefiend, Inner City Hoodlum and other titles; who was he and what happened to him? Why was he silenced and who was behind his murder? Well, we still do not know who killed this talented writer, but at least now with Eddie Stone's effort DONALD WRITES NO MORE we know where Donald Goines came from and what he was about. Writing, as for many others, was the light at the end of that dark tunnel for him and may have eventually pulled him through...and now, because he was murdered, we'll never know...but at least we have his books and Eddie Stones' biography of the man. Highly recommend it to anyone who can appreciate the works of Donald Goines and well-written biographies. We are grateful to Holloway House for standing behind these guys, as well others like Odie Hawkins and Iceberg Slim. They saw value in what these writers had to say long before the majority of the people in the U.S. ever did, although quite a few readers appear to be finally catching on--and we're happy about that!	2001-07-20

You get it all here: the insanity as well as the hilarity as only Bukowski can put it down. Lean and mean, funny and absurd. Nobody writes like him and nobody ever will; oh yes, some might attempt to imitate, but will absolutely fail. Buk has his detractors--and for the most part they are the stuffed shirts, over-paid hacks teaching at some over-rated university or over-paid so-called writers with titles sitting atop some bogus best-selling list, etc.  and get this: he did it all with but a high school education! (as did Hemingway). All those turkeys with all those degrees just hate hearing this, that a guy like Bukowski was able to write rings around them!  My favorite writers/artists were always self-taught and came up the hard way, writers and artists who beat the greatest odds to become the best at what they did: Dutch van Gogh, Knut Hamsun, Dan Fante, Jack Kerouac, Clarence Cooper, Jr., Iceberg Slim, Chester Himes, Jack Black, Nelson Algren, Pleasant Gehman, Celine, Nat West, Jack London, et al.  Read Hollywood, read Ham on Rye and his short stories; it really doesn't matter where you start--but you have been warned: you won't be able to get enough.	2001-06-25

It becomes harder and harder to find anything good to read these days, the no b.s. real thing--and in Dan Fante's Chump Change I am happy to say that I have discovered a real winner! The man can write. Once it arrived in the mail from SPD and I started reading there was no way to put it down--always a good sign. Powerful tale that rings true and authentic--I know, because I once lived in that hellhole called L.A. No disrespect meant towards his diceased father, the also fine writer John Fante, but the son is even better. The writing is so strong and hard-hitting that I put it right up there with John O'Brien's Leaving Las Vegas (although story is entirely different ); the all out style and way of telling his story places this author in the same unique league as Pleasant Gehman, Charles Bukowski, Clarence Cooper, Jr., Robert Beck (Iceberg Slim) Celine, Nat West, etc. Can't wait to get my hands on Mooch, his latest.  To any other book lovers out there, fans of great fiction, who are like me and gave up on the b.s. that is tv and Hollywood flicks a long time ago, I suggest to look up Small Press Distribution or Last Gasp Press for the hard to find well-written gems--as this is how I discovered Dan Fante's Chump Change. Why should it be so difficult for us to find works of art like this book and others like it when so much tripe is out there and placed on bestseller lists by the major publishing houses? you got me there--because I never believe the bestseller lists and never, ever buy anything that is placed right there on tables in the lobby of the major chain stores--because I know it is pure crap, and because it bothers me to know that the true talents like Mr. Dan Fante and others like him have to &quot;sneak in&quot; the back door of publishing by first being published by the smaller indie houses in order to get any recognition at all. So if you can relate to what I'm saying here ignore the junk the big houses are putting out and go for the real thing like this certified modern classic.  We loved Chump Change and wish Mr. Fante all the best in the future. Give us more!	2001-06-25

Once you start reading you won't be able to put it down. Read it from cover to cover in a single sitting. This is honest writing, screams from the gut. You get it all because the lady has the smarts and talent and backbone to give you the truth: the good, the bad and the hilarious. She knows life is that and more because she has lived through it. Enjoy the laughter when you can, she seems to say, and do the best that you can do to get through the less than pleasant moments (like heartbreak and other disappointments) that all of us sometimes find ourselves having to deal with. My only complaint is that she does not have enough books out there! I would like to see Pleasant write a longer work, maybe a novel or her memoirs. I put her up there with the best of them like Carson McCullers, Sylvia Plath, Unica Zurn, Dan Fante, Charles Bukowski, John O'Brien, Nathanael West, Henry Miller, Jack Kerouac, et al. Can't wait for her next book.	2001-06-25
