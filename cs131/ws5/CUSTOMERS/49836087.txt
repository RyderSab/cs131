US	49836087	R305OBX0O22L2F	039441473X	348175363	Assorted Prose	Books	2	2	12	N	N	Non-fiction works wholly lacking sex, character, and plot	This collection of prose works by Pennsylvania's favorite son (and critic) opens with a section of \\"Parodies\\", many of which were way over this reviewer's head, for example the pseudo-scholarly \\"What Is A Rhyme?\\" which purports to barb T.S. Eliot, and the decidedly un-Kerouacesqe \\"On the Sidewalk\\".  Another satirizes a Life Magazine article that had had some impact on the public psyche during the 1950's, but is virtually unknown today.  At least somewhat more amusing is \\"Drinking from a Cup Made Cinchy\\", a satire on books of golf tips, and \\"The Unread Book Route\\", which is less a parody than a Bombeck-style household confession.<br /><br />The \\"First Person Plural\\" section samples Updike's columns written for The New Yorker's \\"Talk of the Town\\" department, and as such is strong on style and in documenting a certain time and place, but its entertainment value is limited by the absence of plot.  Best of these is \\"Doomsday, Mass.\\" which deals with the simple fact of living under the threat of nuclear holocaust.  On a more upbeat note, \\"Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu\\" describes the author's thoughts on seeing the last game played at Fenway Park by Ted Williams.  Maybe Updike is just an ordinary guy after all.<br /><br />\\"First Person Singular\\" features some painfully slow reminiscences on Updike's boyhood that by their very nature lack any real point or direction.  Perhaps the best of these is \\"The Lucid Eye in Silver Town\\", although once again, it assumes some personal connection to New York City which most readers simply won't share.<br /><br />To this reviewer, the standout section is the book reviews, but they aren't likely to be of much interest to the general reader.  The pieces on Thurber, Salinger, and Aiken are succinct and well-thought out, but what will readers derive from Updike's thoughts on such obscure metaphysical works as Karl Barth's \\"Anselm: Fides Quaerens Intellectum\\", Paul Tillich's \\"Morality and Beyond\\", or the \\"Letters of James Agee to Father Flye\\"?  These pieces seem included to establish the author's credentials as a serious intellectual, rather than because anyone was likely to want to read them.<br /><br />Perhaps it was only a young man's vanity that convinced the author this book was worth publishing at all.  But despite the Updike's obvious gift with prose, there's very little worthwhile in this hodgepodge.  Stick to fiction, John; always go with your strength.These pieces seem included to establish the author's credentials as a serious intellectual, rather than because anyone was likely to want to read them. <br /> <br />Perhaps it was only a young man's vanity that convinced the author this book was worth publishing at all.

US	49836087	RWFQY5CQFLLH4	0394747410	202685356	Pylon: The Corrected Text	Books	2	5	10	N	N	Possibly Faulkner's Worst Novel Ever	Virtually unreadable, and really not worth the effort.  Certainly that designation has been applied to the entire oeuvre of this, America's poet laureate of the South, but this novel at least lends some strength to that criticism.  This is Faulkner at his worst, employing his obfuscatory style to hide the fact that he has very little to say.  The plot revolves around a down-and-out newspaper reporter who shows up to cover a traveling air show in the sleepy fictional southern town of New Valois in the early 20th Century.  He finds himself drawn into the personal lives of a family of barnstormers (two husbands, one wife, and one son), and plenty of hard drinking, brawling and barnstorming ensues.  Faulkner was always fascinated by airplanes, and readers who are old enough to remember those halcyon days might find this a fascinating  reminiscence of a somewhat sordid era in aviation history.  But ultimately, this story is about the culture clash between the reporter, who cares about people too much, and the aviators, who care only about the amazing machines that they daily risk their lives in.  Sadly, this man vs. machine conflict is badly dated, even by 20th Century standards, and doesn't fully succeed on any level.<br /><br />Of course one has to admire the sheer technical mastery of Faulkner's writing, but much of the real emotional power of his work usually comes from his use of archetypes:  the Earth Mother, the Mighty Hunter, the Soulless Businessman, the Righteously Angry Negro, the Guileless Innocent, etc.., and these archetypes not only make the story more significant - mythic, even - but they often help guide us through the complexities of the plot.  In this novel the characters seem not only very specific, but very small; they are neither familiar nor important.  Careful readers may be able to follow the plot of this novel, but there seems little enough impetus to bother doing so.  We care less about this particular group of losers than any such in Faulkner.  So while this drunken tale of planes, money and desire may find favor with completists, the rest of us would do better to get our Faulkner fix by re-reading one of his magnificent Yoknapatawpha County classics.er.

US	49836087	R1SMR0WPFSSXEE	0812568966	823350665	Charisma	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A very satisfying multi-genre thriller	Those who only know Barnes through his collaborations with hard sci-fi master Larry Niven should be pleasantly surprised by this genre-esque novel about a group of highly intelligent and amazingly motivated children from small-town, USA.  There are elements of horror, romance, mystery, western, and yes, even a touch of sci-fi, but the result is none of the above, but rather a basically mainstream story about what makes successful people tick.<br /><br />Although one may question the characters' motivations, and there's at least one scientific point that seems like quite a stretch, there's no denying the power of this engrossing mystery.  The kids tend to steal the spotlight, of course, especially when we see how they play the system and manipulate the adult world as they see fit.  Renny Sand is the inquisitive reporter who covered an infamous scandal that shook the town years earlier.  He returns now, after some reversals, driven by his desire for Vivian, the beautiful mother of one of the boys.  And while Sand is a pleasant and engaging enough character, he ultimately doesn't seem to have much to do in this novel.  We think he's being set up as the hero of this tale, but when all's said and done, it's really the gun-slingin' grandma who saves the day, and the sections featuring her and her husband seem slow and largely irrelevant until the climax where all the pieces come together.  Barnes probably should have dropped these two altogether and made Sands the hero.<br /><br />That quibble aside however, this book is a serious page-turner, with mysteries at every turn: the Aristotle project, the pre-school scandal, Sheriff D'Angelo's secret, and the late great Alexander Marcus' weakness, are all explained in good time, but not so quickly that we lose interest in the story before it's been played out.  A very entertaining and altogether satisfying read, but not yet the masterpiece we're hoping for from Barnes.	2005-10-10

Do these outcasts have what it takes to overthrow an authoritarian government and right the social wrongs of America?  Not if the administration's goons have anything to say about it.  A marvelous romp through faith, insanity, free will, and paranoia.<br /><br />While not technically part of the \\"Valis\\" trilogy, this book deals with many of the same themes and occasionally even the same events, some of which supposedly really happened.  It seems likely that the reason Dick never published this novel during his lifetime is because so much of this material had already been covered in his other books.  But this work is far more novelistic, telling a chronological story about how two individuals decided to stick it to the Man, and less a scholarly treatise on the nature of God, reality, the universe, etc...  For those who found \\"Valis\\" a little too methodological in its analysis of comparative cosmologies and so forth, \\"Albemuth\\" is a much more readable, straightforward science fiction novel.  If you haven't read the \\"Valis\\" trilogy yet, read this book first.<br /><br />The characters are pretty much standard for Dick: the everyman who overdid the drug culture during the 1960's, and the science fiction writer who tries to turn everything into a story.  Since both of these are Dick's alter-egos, they serve to bring the writer into the action and let him toy with both autobiography and meta-fiction.  As a general rule, Dick's style is easy enough to read, but his plots are often difficult to follow, since things are rarely what they appear to be and some dichotomies are never really resolved.  Unlike some of his better known works, this book at least has a fairly clear-cut conclusion.  The bottom line is: if you're a fan of imaginative fiction who is still unfamiliar with the work of this astonishing writer, then you need to tune in pronto.  And while this may not be the master's tightest work, those new to Dick might just as well start here as anywhere.clear-cut conclusion.

US	49836087	RVJ6OMUZHNVZ2	0671876716	44071865	Podkayne of Mars	Books	2	4	9	N	N	The most annoying protagonists in all sci-fi	Characterization has never been a strong suit in classic science fiction, but at least the usual flat, predictable, stock characters don't steal a lot of attention away from the story.  But Heinlein's longstanding tendency to draw his characters larger than life gets badly out of hand in this modest adventure yarn.  Two kids whose intelligence far exceeds their good judgment are the protagonists, and surely they are the most annoying characters ever spotlighted in sci-fi.  The manipulative little boy genius in particular is badly in need of some serious disciplining (he smuggles a bomb on board ship in order to make a few bucks - this not your average mischief-making here).<br /><br />Of course Heinlein is trying to make a point (when isn't he?) that children who don't get enough attention from their parents are inclined to grow up under-socialized.  But he uses this point to posit that a woman's place is in the home, taking care of children, a thesis that will surely not endear him to today's women.  But if female readers aren't the target audience for this book, then why have a female protagonist (Podkayne is a little girl's name) in the first place?  So clearly this is not the book's flaw, but its actual intention: Heinlein specifically wrote this book to tell young women to forget their dreams of an exciting career and get used to spending their lives raising children.  So much for the author's vaunted libertarianism - it obviously doesn't apply to the female half of the human race.<br /><br />This book also features racial elements that seem more than a little out of place.  Presumably Heinlein meant well - writing in a racist society, he wanted to show how fundamentally unimportant race really is, but then he undercuts his own thesis by the very fact of calling attention to it.  And having Poddy continually referring to her uncle (the ambassador) as \\"Uncle Tom\\"!  This reviewer was embarrassed to be reading it.<br /><br />Both of these attempts at social relevance seem painfully misguided from a modern perspective; to say that this book is badly dated would be a gross understatement.  Any entertainment value that might have attached to this book is overshadowed by the monumental ignorance the author displays in his attempts to portray characters with whom he pretty clearly has nothing in common.  A valuable lesson to would-be writers: stick to what you know.  The best part of this book?

US	49836087	R8JJF9YSV6YJL	0441011063	673832066	Guardian	Books	2	6	7	N	N	Pointlessly slow, with a ridiculous ending	Haldeman demonstrates the pitfalls of genre-bending fiction in this historical/fantasy novel that reads like it was started by Jack London and completed by Arthur C. Clarke.  The heroine, Rosa Coleman, was an east-coast society lady until difficult personal circumstances caused her to begin a lifelong journey across turn-of-the-century America.<br /><br />Rosa's adventures in the rough and ready West make for fairly interesting reading, particularly the sections that are set in Alaska, since we seldom see this side of American history discussed from a feminine perspective.  Once or twice we get brief hints that something otherworldly is going on, when Rosa gets visits from the mysterious Raven, but there's not much here that isn't straight historical fiction...<br /><br />Until we're just about done with the book, when we suddenly find that Rosa Coleman's America is really a far-out sci-fi fantasy world where time and space can be traversed as easily as riding a train.  (Too bad she didn't find that out 150 pages earlier; we could've saved a lot of time reading about outmoded forms of transportation).  The closing pages cover territory that other sci-fi writers have handled much more imaginatively and effectively, but that's not nearly as serious a flaw as the fact that these events don't belong in this book at all.  Haldeman clearly didn't know how to end this modest historical novel he was working on, so he took a left turn and went off into outer space.  But the fact is that this is plain bad storytelling, cheating the readers out of the conclusion they deserve.  Every story should have a point to it, and if the point of this novel was Rosa's adventures in America, Haldeman needed a conclusion that made sense within that context.  And if the point of the novel was the trippy alternate-reality stuff, then why devote most of the book to the events in Philadelphia, and Dodge City, and the Alaskan tundra, and the  endless travels in between?<br /><br />If you're a fan of travelogues where the main attraction is the descriptions of scenery and unique adventures in exotic locales, you'll probably enjoy watching this engaging woman cross the USA.  But if, like this reviewer, you expect a story to have a beginning, middle, and most of all, an ending that stems organically from that beginning, this book will be a real disappointment.e a fan of travelogues where the main attraction is the descriptions of scenery and unique adventures in exotic locales, you'll probably enjoy watching this engaging woman cross the USA.

This first novel by R.K. Narayan details the adventures of a rather obstinate boy named Swaminithan.  His \\"chums\\" include the usual mix: the bully, the brain, the leader, etc..., and the developing relationships between them accounts for a substantial chunk of the plot.  After making friends with the new kid in town, Swami gets involved in a fraudulent financial scheme, quits school (repeatedly), and eventually runs away from home to escape his teacher's torments and his father's displeasure.  Although his parents surely love their son very much, they, like most other adults, are rather shadowy figures in this book.  The day to day challenges of school (both academic and social) are by far the most important facets of this boy's life.<br /><br />In short, there's a great deal about this book that will be familiar to Western readers despite the exotic setting.  Highlights include the time Swami gets caught up in a day of political protest that winds up trashing the school, and the time Swami runs away from home and has to face the terrible tiger.  Less enjoyable is the section that deals with cricket, a sport that has absolutely no fascination for this reader and very little for the most of the world outside of India.  Still, Narayan's style is just about impeccable; warm, soothing, and gently comic, with a fine understanding of human nature, and an easy acceptance of human weakness.  It's not Narayan's best book (the plot could be tighter) but it's a very good starting point for someone who's just discovering this fine writer.	2005-09-11

Or has he?<br /><br />Roger Folger is a sixty-one year old widower who has daily communications with his departed wife Stella.  The point of view alternates between these two characters, and certainly the best part of the book is Stella's quaint descriptions of heaven, which, she gushes, is very much like the Ritz-Carlton in Florida.  Given the wealth of possibilities, it seems as though Buchwald should have been able to come up with something a little more inventive, but unfortunately, that's about as funny as this book gets.  Convinced that her husband is pining away without her, Stella does everything she can to fix Roger up with another woman: one who meets her stringent criteria of what kind of wife he needs, naturally.  The chapters with Roger are almost painful as we watch his fitful attempts to get on with his life.  These scenes aren't comic so much as pathetic, and there's no real insight into either his character or his plight.<br /><br />This middle-aged husband found the story more depressing than funny, and possessing little enough in the way of redeeming social value.  Even Buchwald must have recognized the weakness of this book since he subtitled it \\"Almost a Novel\\".  The characters are lame jokes, the plot is razor-thin, and the point is something like \\"Love is where you find it\\" or \\"Life goes on\\", and that's about it.  This slim volume possesses enough humor for a couple of good newspaper columns, and that's really all.	2005-09-10
US	49836087	R2NV9YCDZH95CK	0316769495	551899474	Franny and Zooey	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Teen-age intellectuals search for fulfillment in the 1950's	A young woman asks, \\"Isn't there more than this?\\" \\"Perhaps not,\\" her brother answers, \\"but does there need to be?\\"  While not taken from the book, this exchange briefly summarizes this discursive intellectual thought-piece from J.D. Salinger.  Comprised of two stories that were published separately in \\"The New Yorker\\" during the mid-fifties, the transition to `novel' was never entirely completed, but this book about two college-age siblings and their search for fulfillment is certainly not without appeal.<br /><br />The first story, \\"Franny\\" reads like a comedy of manners focusing on the Ivy League college crowd of the 1950's.  Franny and her boyfriend Lane are two bright young intellectuals, with comfortable backgrounds and brilliant futures who go on about the Yale Game, and their course work, and their academic advisors, etc.., ad nauseum, in more than enough detail to make us feel like we're right there in the restaurant with them.  But it soon transpires that Franny is no more interested in their insipid chatter than we are.  Questioning the value of her studies, the wisdom of her teachers, and the ability of her fellow students, Franny is only going through the motions of her day to day life.  Her dissatisfaction comes to a head when she passes out at the restaurant.<br /><br />The sequel, \\"Zooey\\" reveals that Franny is a member of the celebrated Glass family, and finds her ensconced with her mother, brother, and cat in the family's New York apartment.  At this point the narrator, older brother Buddy Glass rears his unwelcome head and dominates the rest of the book.  Unwelcome, because Salinger loses his artistic distance and allows the material to become cloying.  To wit: all 7 or so Glass siblings were child prodigies of encyclopedic knowledge, talent, creativity, and religious wisdom; they all grew to love each other very much, including their parents, and all of them are either successful or dead or both.  Buddy's adoration of his family smothers us, and becomes the whole focus of the story.  We don't get into the other characters' heads nearly as much as we get into the narrator's.  We see every little detail of the story played out, with plenty of voice-overs to ensure that we don't miss the significance of a single detail.  Meanwhile, Franny sleeps through the middle section, and Lane is completely abandoned.<br /><br />But despite the skill with which Salinger portrays teenage alienation, this book is not likely to play well with anyone who is not a white, middle-class intellectual; if you're not a Glass, you don't belong here.  This story is just a gentle reminder that even during peacetime, young people can find reasons to be upset with the system - it goes with the territory.  Teens who are into self-discovery should find resonance with their own feelings - they're certainly the target audience - but its doubtful that today's young intellectuals see nothing more to be critical of than their professors' affectations.

After a single exposure, Sweetscent's wife Katharine has become helplessly addicted to a little-known drug called JJ-180, which has time-warping properties.  She purposely addicts the good doctor (her husband) in order to obtain his help.  Eric's fight for survival leads him through a pharmaceutical company to the world government itself, where UN Secretary General Gino Molinari is using the reality-warping powers of JJ-180 to ward off an alien invasion.  Can Eric conquer his addiction, save his wife, and fend off the alien overlords?  Longtime readers of Dick's work can probably guess the answer.<br /><br />Even with all the dangers and plot twists in this story, it's still basically an allegory about power.  JJ-180 gives its users power over others, and the power to control events far beyond themselves.  Katharine uses the drug's power to control her husband, even at the risk of killing him.  Facing death, Eric uses his power to control others, but stops short of controlling his own wife.  The moral is aptly summed up by the cabdriver at the book's conclusion: for Eric to take some critical step \\"would be to say, I can't endure reality as such.  I have to have uniquely special easier conditions\\".  A former drug addict himself, Dick is telling us that reality has to be enough for all of us, even when the going gets rough.  We shouldn't need to have anything \\"uniquely special\\" just to make life worth living.  A must for fans of PDK; for others who aren't put off by science fiction and Dick's quirky storytelling style, a sad and moving tale of love and reality.	2005-09-01

After five books and thousands of pages, one can be excused for anticipating one heck of a payoff.  Sadly, Heaven's Reach isn't nearly the book we'd hoped for.<br /><br />Even without all the buildup, this wouldn't have been a very good novel, and if you haven't read volumes 2, 4, and 5 of the series, you'll have no connection to the characters or their predicament.  But the worst problem is that by the time you've slogged your way through the myriad plot threads that lead you to this book, you're really eager, perhaps desperate, to see how Brin ties it all together.  Seemingly endless questions were raised in Startide, almost none of which were answered in volumes 3,4,or 5.  Instead, Brin continued introducing new characters, new alien species, whole new worlds, all desperately struggling against overwhelming odds to maintain their own freedom.  And after spending many weeks (more likely months) rooting for these characters, you can scarcely wait to find out how they defeat their oppressors and live happily ever after.<br /><br />And that's why this book is such a disappointment.  The dozen-odd plot threads that we followed breathlessly through Brightness Reef, and with increasing agitation through Infinity's Shore, merely fizzle out in different directions.  Instead of a grand climactic battle in which all of the heroes we've become so involved with all join together and vanquish their enemies, we get a rabbit-out-of-the-hat ending that basically renders the two previous volumes moot.  One certainly gets the impression that Brin didn't know where he was going when he started the second trilogy, began stories that he had no real plan for, and then wound up having to finish the series before he was really ready.  The scenes in the alternate universe seemed particularly pointless and out of place, but that shouldn't surprise us, since introducing twists that undercut everything that came before is something that Brin does again and again.  If the planet Jijo had been uninhabited, the entire trilogy could have been boiled down into one medium length novel, and resolved just as many questions about Streaker and the Uplift War as these 1400+ pages did.  Of course we would have missed the fine adventure and unique alien creations of Brightness Reef, but this reviewer isn't convinced that the journey is worthwhile for its own sake - and surely the destination isn't any justification at all.  This volume is rambling and muddled, with no character development, and too many  god-in-a-machine miracles out of nowhere.  Read Startide through Brightness Reef, and then make up your own ending.

A beautiful woman, driven by the dream of her deceased brother, launches a daring scientific project that will send hundreds of probes each carrying the essence of humankind out to the far reaches of the universe.  To do so, she acquires the aid of a small handful of men, each of whom possess one of the requisite characteristics to ensure the race's survival.<br /><br />The story switches back and forth between \\"real time\\" - a point in the far future where a probe is actually well on its way to its destination - and extensive flashback sequences, where we meet the men whose personalities were impressed onto the part-human/part-robotic astronauts.  The flashback sequences interrupt the story more than they inform it, and are ultimately annoying; not only because they delay the progress of the action, but because the characters themselves are both unpleasant and uninteresting.  Because of all these interruptions, the action has very little flow to it.  Even apart from that, the story being told is too episodic to hold together well, and neither the Defender nor his progenitors are engaging enough that we ever really care about the outcome.  The few developed characters are so stiff and wooden that the novel reads like it was written in the 50's rather than the 80's.  Okay, so humanity is fallible, already.  This book provides no new insights, and seems pointlessly depressing.	2005-08-09

And the main plot line shows how the entire family is endangered (and has their lives dramatically changed) by their involvement in a black family's fight for due process.<br /><br />But this isn't as small a novel as \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". Doctorow's focus on the family and the personal side of these events is only the lynchpin that holds together a sweeping, wide-ranging look at turn-of-the-century society as a whole. Perhaps not since \\"War and Peace\\" has one novel so successfully combined the intimately personal with the grand scope of history. Politics, racism, sexual mores, yellow journalism, corruption, the entertainment revolution, terrorism, labor relations: all pass under Doctorow's analytical gaze. Easy to read and not overlong, this would be a great book for high school students to read in learning about pre-War American society, if it weren't for the sexual content, which is higher than average for a work of this kind.  As it is, this novel is episodic enough that teachers could assign excerpts without killing the power of the whole book.  Very highly recommended.	2005-08-02

The opening chapters feature plenty of laughs as Mullen very self-consciously details his disdain for the country and its manifold flaws, all in good fun, of course. Speaking as a typical New Yorker, Mullen suggests that, \\"Upstate is to New York City what Canada is to the United States - a great, empty space to the north that most people are quite happy to know nothing about\\". But after his wife gives up smoking and decides she needs something to do with her hands, Mullen dutifully accompanies her to \\"a town that looks as if the Unabomber were the head of the planning board\\" and their new dream house in the country. Its dilapidated condition comes as quite a shock to its unwilling owner: \\"The bathroom combined all the worst features of Appalachian and European plumbing in one convenient spot. Why they brought this toilet indoors one can only guess. Keeping up with the Clampetts, no doubt\\". The friendly neighbors, the silent nights, the desultory dress code, the local shopping alternatives all hit our new homeowner like the smell of the fresh cow manure.<br /><br />But Mullen's story is by no means one-sided: as his wife succeeds in dragging him off to the country on a more and more frequent basis, we see our narrator undergo a fascinating transformation. Having learned the sagacity of country customs, his barbs turn against the ignorant city-dwellers, who he now sees are just as provincial in their own way.  The humorous highlight here is when some friends from the City come to visit for a weekend, providing the denoument to a running joke about turning the barn into a guest house.  But the almost poetic passage where he favorably compares the view out his front window with a Monet canvas is truly enthralling, and assures us that the writer is indeed seeing the world through fresh eyes again.

While the preceding volume, \\"Brightness Reef\\", closed a specific chapter of the planetary conflict without actually resolving anything, \\"Shore\\" ends on a cliffhanger that essentially obligates the reader to continue on to \\"Heaven's Reach\\". And while the three books together form a single story, there's no question that \\"Reef\\" is the most complete by itself, and boasts the delightful introduction to the idyllic planet of Jijo and its fascinating diversity of sapient alien races. \\"Shore\\", on the other hand, doesn't present us with anything like a conclusion to the multifaceted conflict that is described at such extreme length and in so much pointless detail. What we do get is a fascinating series of adventures, as we follow the fates of a dozen-odd major characters introduced in \\"Reef\\" as well as in the first trilogy's \\"Startide Rising\\".<br /><br />In this volume the fallow world of Jijo is invaded for a second time, this time not by the clever and manipulative Rothen (\\"Brightness Reef\\") but by the fierce and brutal Jophur. In something of an excess of melodrama, the Jophur openly threaten to commit genocide against the wheeled g'kek and forcibly re-make their own cousins, the ruminative Traeki. Fairly early in this volume, Brin drops his biggest bomb - the tie in between Jijo and the starship Streaker which was featured in \\"Startide Rising\\", and whose fate had never been resolved. And assuming any resolution is better than none at all, Brin delivers - not in this book, but in the concluding volume \\"Heaven's Reach\\".<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"Reach\\" is rather a disappointment, which really undercuts the power of the work presently under discussion. Again and again, this reviewer found himself asking in wonderment, `How is Brin going to tie all this together? How are all these entertaining characters and exciting plotlines going to merge into a single thread that resolves the questions that were left hanging by \\"Startide\\" and haven't been addressed since?' But the fact of the matter is that \\"Reach\\" finds Brin desperately over-reaching, and is ultimately unable to provide a satisfying conclusion to the story of which this book is the thrilling middle. If \\"Reach\\" had been better, this book would surely rate 5 stars for its action and adventure. But as it is, it's almost a book without an ending. There's no point in reading this one and not going forward with the final volume, but if you find yourself disappointed by the conclusion, don't say you weren't warned. Your best bet - petition Brin to re-write \\"Heaven's Reach\\" in such a way that better synthesizes the multitudinous characters and storylines that he spent so much time developing before he realized he didn't have any use for them and had to bring in whole new tons of gobbledy-gook just to keep them busy.

The \\"Second Uplift Trilogy\\" is more tightly knit than the first, which had only haphazard interrelationships. \\"Reef\\" introduces us to another new planet, populated with a curious mix of sentient species who have learned to live together in peace and harmony. Brin outdoes himself in developing half-a-dozen new alien races, each represented by a main character or two, whose point of view is used to narrate a specific plot thread. While the events that unfold on Jijo seem unrelated to the previous trilogy, Brin is putting pieces in place that will ultimately conclude the story of the unlucky space-vessel Streaker, which was begun in \\"Startide Rising\\" and then completely ignored in \\"The Uplift War\\".<br /><br />Readers will fall in love with the idyllic civilization on Jijo, with its enforced simplicity, closeness to nature, and communal brotherhood of once-fractious aliens, which is why we become so involved when it all seems likely to be ruined by alien invaders. The various points of view send us off in a dozen different directions at once, and keeping track of all these storylines becomes more than a little challenging, but one stays with it because of the conviction that all these subplots will come together to finally drive off the bad guys and everyone will live happily ever after. The fact that this doesn't happen is easily this book's greatest flaw. For all its 500+ pages, it's only an opening salvo - the story never comes to its logical conclusion (or any conclusion at all) but instead leaves off with a cliff-hanger that leads us into the next 500+ page volume, \\"Infinite's Shore\\". Having since read the entire Second Uplift Trilogy, this reviewer's advice is to replace Reef's conclusion with the ending hinted at two sentences ago, and forget about the rest of the series. Thus modified, Reef would surely be a five-star selection. As it is, the book doesn't stand on its own, but depends on (wait for it) \\"Heaven's Reach\\" to actually provide a conclusion, and that conclusion isn't nearly as satisfying as the one suggested herein - certainly not as good as it should be considering the length of the journey.<br /><br />But this is easily the best book of the Second Trilogy, with fascinating aliens and plenty of excitement, and if you absolutely can't live without knowing how Brin resolves the questions opened in \\"Startide Rising\\" you really should start here. Too bad we can't write our own ending to the series as easily as we can write an ending to this delightful volume. Enjoy it for the ride, not the destination.As it is, the book doesn't stand on its own, but depends on (wait for it) \\"Heaven's Reach\\" to actually provide a conclusion, and that conclusion isn't nearly as satisfying as the one suggested herein - certainly not as good as it should be considering the length of the journey. <br /> <br />But this is easily the best book of the Second Trilogy, with fascinating aliens and plenty of excitement, and if you absolutely can't live without knowing how Brin resolves the questions opened in \\"Startide Rising\\" you really should start here.

Military installations, enormous malls, and a mechanized transportation system are now the dominant landmarks in areas once dedicated to orange groves. Against this gray backdrop, we get the story of would-be writer Jim McPherson, a smart and sensitive young man who has given in to the ennui of his age. He holds jobs that he has no enthusiasm for. He has relationships that have little meaning to him. He spends much of his time in the company of his social group: a bunch of recreational drug users dedicated to living the good life, and many of whom have more focus in their lives than he does. With so little direction in his life, is it any wonder Jim finds himself drawn into a terrorist campaign against the military-industrial establishment that his well-meaning father works for?<br /><br />There's not much science fiction here, aside from an overall upgrade in the level of gadgetry, and while 80's societal trends are neatly extrapolated, there aren't any radically new ideas that grab one's attention. But if you can identify at all with Jim's stultifying malaise (something many people have been through at one time or another) this novel provides an interesting look at the effect the military-industrial complex has on modern American life. If you can't, this book will probably leave you cold.<br /><br />One gets the impression that Robinson is unloading a lot of personal baggage in this book, leading this reviewer to question his artistic distance from the material. It's easy for a writer to put too much of himself on the page, not realizing that his readers won't \\"get it\\" in the same way that he does. Some sections seem to border on autobiography while others (are those historical entries Jim's or Robinson's?) read like a history textbook. Ultimately the book stands as a cautionary tale about industrial \\"progress\\" and its impact on our humanity. Jim barely escapes the destructive force of his own alienation, but others will not be so fortunate, with results that could be catastrophic for us all. But although this isn't an especially happy story, it's not entirely without hope either. Like Jim, we can renounce violence and re-establish our connection to the natural world, and hopefully undo some of the damage that's been done, building a better future for all.book stands as a cautionary tale about industrial \\"progress\\" and its impact on our humanity.

In Updike's world, pick any four couples and you've got yourself seven adulterers and one weirdo - quite a different Pennsylvania from the one this reviewer lives in.<br /><br />In this mixed volume of fiction, \\"The Women Who Got Away\\", \\"New York Girl\\", \\"Natural Color\\", the Bech story \\"His Oeuvre\\" and the surprising \\"Scene From the Fifties\\" all revolve around marital infidelity and the burgeoning sexual revolution.  Updike's obsession with adultery leads one to suspect that the writer suffered from post-coital remorse, and tried to come to grips with his own indiscretions by implying that they are symptomatic of the culture, and so not really his fault.  The stories invariably show how tawdry these encounters are, how irresponsible he recognizes them to be, and how paranoid the perpetrators become, all to convince someone (His family?  His mistress?  His readers?  His Maker?) that it really wasn't all that much fun.  \\"Let me off easy,\\" he seems to be saying, \\"I've already suffered enough.\\"<br /><br />\\"Rabbit Remembered\\" is the real class of this collection, and a worthy capstone to the Rabbit series, but readers unfamiliar with the four novels preceding shouldn't expect to get much out of it.  Recapitulations of the events from the prior novels are often pretty brief, giving the barest review of the facts and skipping all the emotional fallout.  The focus is on the late Harry \\"Rabbit\\" Angstrom's son Nelson, and the changes that take place in his life when his unbeknownst half-sister Annabelle shows up at his mother's house.<br /><br />Fans of Updike's work will surely appreciate this one last entry into the Rabbit franchise, even if there isn't much else to recommend this volume.  Those new to Updike should start anywhere but here; the adultery-go-round of the first dozen stories is sure to leave a bad taste in the mouths of most readers, and the redeeming qualities of \\"Remembered\\" will be wholly opaque to the uninitiated.ose new to Updike should start anywhere but here; the adultery-go-round of the first dozen stories is sure to leave a bad taste in the mouths of most readers, and the redeeming qualities of \\"Remembered\\" will be wholly opaque to the uninitiated.	2005-05-05

Admittedly, there are some real clunkers in here, but a fair amount of variety (from a genre standpoint) and most readers should find at least one story they'll want to read again next Christmas.<br /><br />\\"Miracle\\" is a fine example of Willis' much-documented ability to merge the fantastic with the everyday.  A typical harried office worker finds herself dealing with a particularly troublesome Christmas Spirit just at the time of year when she's already much too busy.<br /><br />\\"Inn\\" is a less successful version of the same, placed in a mainline church.  It seems like a lame brand of physical comedy is being presented as the heroine shepherds her destitute charges round and round the church building, but it goes on far too long for the amount of story in it.<br /><br />\\"In Coppelius's Toyshop\\" has an irritating protagonist trapped in an even more absurd travesty, but without the sci-fi trappings or religious significance that bolstered \\"Inn\\".  An almost total failure.<br /><br />\\"Pony\\" is okay, but too short to merit much interest.<br /><br />\\"Adaptation\\" features some of the ghosts from Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol\\" working in a modern bookstore.  This one isn't bad, and certainly isn't as predictable as some of the others, but it's still not great.<br /><br />\\"Cat's Paw\\" is a parody of a Sherlock Holmes-style mystery revolving around a murder at Christmas-time (if that's not one genre too many for you).<br /><br />\\"Newsletter\\" taps Heinlein's classic The Puppet Masters for an unforgettable alien invasion.  This one is pretty light-hearted for a science fiction tale, but it's this reviewer's personal favorite.<br /><br />\\"Epiphany\\" is a more religious entry, but drags on a bit too long.  Most readers will get the point pretty early on, and once you do, there's really nothing left.<br /><br />Well worth reading are Willis' \\"Introduction\\", \\"A Final Word\\", \\"Twelve Things to Read at Christmas\\" and \\"And Twelve to Watch\\".  Her analyses of what makes a good Christmas tale are so insightful that one is almost tempted to wonder why the rest of the book isn't better than it is.<br /><br />Not for those who take their sci-fi too seriously.

The protagonist, young firebrand Abelard Lindsay, is exiled from the satellite of his birth after an act of youthful rebellion goes awry.  His subsequent adventures take him (and us) on a kaleidoscopic ride through the inhabited reaches of the solar system.  In his struggle to survive in a series of brutally harsh environments, he must deal with the vicissitudes of living, loving and acquiring credit in an ever-accelerating society, and at the same time stay one step ahead of his dread nemesis, his treacherous former friend Constantine.  As a backdrop to his story, there is the ongoing social conflict between Mechanists, who favor advanced cybernetics, and the Shapers, who would rather modify humanity genetically.<br /><br />Devotees of cyberpunk will almost certainly enjoy this novel, which moves at a frenetic pace, includes frequent references to prosthetic devices, and tries to fit a modest degree of real science into its outlandish space opera.  Certainly the young Lindsay could be considered a punk, and not a particularly likable one, at that, although he seems to mellow as the (many) decades fly by.<br /><br />But the problems with this book are many, and tend to undercut the positives, the biggest mistake being that Sterling just tries to do too much.  There's a point in the novel where Lindsay has successfully dealt with the pirates, liberated the station, heard the news that the aliens have landed, and he's even got the girl, and this reader found himself thinking, \\"this would have been a good place to end the story - too bad it's only halfway through the book\\".  The problem is that too many of Sterling's ideas get pretty short shift, lost in a cascade of characters and events and locales and discoveries and treacheries and escapes and suicides and lies and martyrdoms, etc...  Sterling might have written a whole series of much better novels by approaching each piece of his tale as a separate work, rather than cramming it all into one volume.  Admittedly, the scope of the whole is admirable, and serves to make Sterling's point if we concede it to be that \\"whatever happens life wins out in the end\\", but ultimately the pacing is too erratic, the plot too episodic, and the characters too unsympathetic to merit a real recommendation.better novels by approaching each piece of his tale as a separate work, rather than cramming it all into one volume.

The overriding purpose seems to be to explode the myth behind the all-too-human countrymen who fought in the resistance.  Rather than glamorize them as heroes, as had been done in countless books and tales of the period, Calvino takes great pains to show just how foolish, short-sighted and pathetic many of these men really were.  Even harsher is his portrayal of the windbags in the barroom, who are quick to egg others on to action, but prove unwilling to take any such risks themselves.  Of course he saves what is perhaps the very harshest criticism for his fictional sister - who is literally in bed with the enemy - and himself - in the person of the lonely street urchin Pin, who like the sister, is desperate to fit in anywhere with anyone at any price.<br /><br />While this all may sound rather heavy and depressing, the viewpoint of the young lad gives it all a fresh and essentially non-judgmental veneer.  Think of \\"The Wonder Years\\", only focusing on a homeless boy growing up under fascist rule.  The characters are skillfully sketched, although hardly people one would care to know, and while the plot is not overburdened with action for a war novel, things move along a fair pace.<br /><br />Calvino is best known for his technical fireworks, and while there are one or two spots where we see him developing these skills, for the most part the story is told in a very straightforward, chronological fashion.  So Calvino's fans, who likely start each of his novels expecting a book unlike any they've ever read, may be disappointed at how pedestrian an approach the master takes to telling this story.  On the other hand, readers who find Calvino's novels \\"too bizarre\\" may find this one surprisingly palatable, or at least comprehensible.	2005-01-15

The book is heavily slanted towards discussion of the recorded legacy, up through and including the then-current release, \\"Talk\\".  All in all it's a fast, easy read, but it's clearly more for hard-core fans than for casual listeners.<br /><br />The biggest shortcoming of this book is the band-mates' unwillingness to talk about themselves and each other, and the fact that Morse does nothing to fill in those gaps.  For example, the band starts getting together on page 8.  That means each of the musicians gets about 2 paragraphs to give us his life story up to the point where he joins the band, and with that trace some of his musical influences.  Later in the book, there's a chapter that describes life \\"On The Road\\": 12 pages.  There's almost no mention of their families or their relationships or their interests outside of music, political concerns, religious beliefs, sexual exploits, etc...  This is the sanitized version of Yes -  perhaps this book was primarily directed towards young teens.  Certainly they're not saying anything they wouldn't want their own kids to know.  In any case, don't expect to come away from this book feeling you know these guys personally.<br /><br />What they are willing to talk about is the recorded legacy of the band, and that's where this book really shines.  Every single album is commented on by all of its participants, and some non-participants as well, usually track by track, providing a set of differing and often conflicting viewpoints on each recording in the catalogue.  Of course that doesn't mean that all will now be revealed.  Nobody ever discusses the lyrics except Jon Anderson, and what he has to say about them is frequently no less cryptic than the lines themselves.  So if you were hoping for a line by line analysis of the song lyrics, this book will give you very little.  No, the most common topic for discussion is: who wrote which parts of each of the songs.  In fact, Patrick Moraz warns readers not to believe the credits on the albums - certainly there's a greater difference of opinion about this single topic than any other.  But soon enough this petty squabbling gets tiresome, and ultimately meaningless, since we can never know the truth.  Meanwhile, we do get a pretty fair view of the kaleidoscopic personnel changes that were this band's hallmark, and a pretty good feel for how difficult, and indeed how unpleasant it must have been to be a part of this exceptional band.<br /><br />If you like to sit around with your friends and discuss which Yes album is your favorite, this will be an invaluable source book, but if you're looking for a literary treatment, or musicological analysis, or details of the band members' private lives, you should look elsewhere.

All of the major sci-fi writers are represented, and quite of few of the stories are simply unforgetable.  Never has one volume collected more thoughtful meditations on humanity's relationship to technology.  Devotees of more modern science fiction (i.e., cyberpunk, etc...) may not be impressed, but for fans of Old School sci-fi, it doesn't get any better than this.<br /><br />Of course many devoted fans will already have many of these stories in their collections - how could it be otherwise?  The cream always rises to the top.  So some might wish to forgo purchasing this volume, and use the table of contents as a reading list instead.<br /><br />As is typical of the genre during this period, there's little here that will shock the youngsters, and the reading is pretty easy overall.  So this is an excellent book for those just discovering the genre, or trying to understand what all the excitement is about.  Be forewarned, however, that the volume begins with some of the older and consequently weaker entries, so those for whom this book represents an exploration into unknown territory might be better served by skipping the first 3 to 5 stories and starting with either Heinlein's exciting \\"The Roads Must Roll\\" which features next week's travel technology, or Theodore Sturgeon's amazing \\"Microcosmic God\\" which looks at creating life, or if you're very picky about what you read, going straight for Isaac Asimov's famed \\"Nightfall\\".  Another alternative is to start at the back and read forward.  There are some very powerful pieces loaded into the back end, including a couple of tear-jerkers, Tom Godwin's \\"The Cold Equations\\" and Daniel Knight's \\"Flowers for Algernon\\".<br /><br />Regardless of how you read it, these stories, more than any other work, represent what science fiction is really about: the human condition remains the same, even as the world around us changes.

So one might reasonably expect great things from him in the realm of fantasy, which after all, seems to play to his strengths.  And that's the main reason this book was rather disappointing.<br /><br />Lord Valentine's Castle is the first in a series of books set on the planet Majipoor, a vast, metals-poor world, settled by humanity thousands of years ago, and now home to several other sentient species as well.  The story has a naïve simplicity to it that will enable most readers to figure out the main plot points within the first few pages of this seemingly endless book, so this reviewer will refrain from giving too much away here.  Suffice it to say that an amnesiac joins a troupe of itinerant jugglers and embarks on a solemn quest.  As is typical of fantasy, there's no real point being made here; the work exists solely for its entertainment value, which unfortunately is not that great.  This reviewer found the first enormous chapter intriguing enough, but the story slowly plodded downhill from there.  Not only is the tale bone-dry humorless, but there isn't really that much action either.<br /><br />Silverberg works hard to create a sense of awe at the beauty and size and variety and majesty of this world he's created, and to some extent he's successful, but at the same time it all seems to fall rather flat, perhaps because there're just too many pages to slog through between the interesting parts.  Only the protagonist shows any sign of being more than a one-dimensional character; everyone else exists only to serve him in his quest, with little enough motivation of their own.  And the conclusion would have been laughable if the readers hadn't already worn themselves out getting there.  The ease with which the hero vanquishes his enemies seems more consistent with a short story than with a 500+ page novel.<br /><br />Approaching it as a fantasy, this book probably rates four stars, being perhaps better than the run of the mill, but as science fiction, it deserves no more than two.  While there are few obvious inconsistencies in the story, Silverberg's approach here is distinctly non-scientific.  He shows us the marvels of Majipoor, but he doesn't explain the details of how it's done, except to say in passing that someone \\"has a device\\" that accomplishes this.  But science fiction fans who want to know the theory behind it, and some details of its construction, may be forgiven for not bothering to finish this ponderous tome.<br /><br />For devotees of the epic fantasy, this may be fairly good stuff, but hard science fiction fans will surely be disappointed, and the general reading public may find themselves regretting the 20 hours of their lives that they'll never get back.nquishes his enemies seems more consistent with a short story than with a 500+ page novel.   <br /> <br />Approaching it as a fantasy, this book probably rates four stars, being perhaps better than the run of the mill, but as science fiction, it deserves no more than two.

Light adventure and juvenile novels gave way to \\"serious\\" science fiction works that actually \\"meant something\\".  Much of this transition took place during the turbulent 1960's, and it is in this context that we should consider Norstrilia.<br /><br />Part One was published in '64, and paints a delightfully barbed portrait of the kind of people who live in Northern Australia - the antecedents of the planet of Norstrilia.  In a cosmic irony worthy of Vonnegut, Norstrilia is the only planet that can grow \\"stroon\\" - the prized longevity drug - making it the richest planet in the galaxy, but it is inhabited by a people who are almost painfully rooted in the past; insular, anti-technology, with strong ties to the land, reverent towards their ancestors as well as the unseen Queen of the Commonwealth, and practicing strict eugenics to preserve the purity of their lineage.  This latter almost proves the undoing of the protagonist, Rod McBan the 151st, since he was born with a distinct genetic defect, being unable to communicate via telepathy the way everyone else does.<br /><br />Part Two was published in '68, and is consequently faster-paced, somewhat racier, and distinctly more class-conscious.  Rod travels to Earth, having just purchased it with the aid of Norstilia's only electronic computer, which has learned how to manipulate the interstellar stock market.  On Earth, Linebarger (Smith) shows how all real work is done by \\"under-people\\" - half-human half-animal creatures who are struggling towards the day they can demand equal rights.  Is Rod the savior the under-people have been waiting for?  Will he find love with the beautiful cat-woman C'mell?  And can Rod find sanctuary from the Honorable Secretary, who is trying to kill him?<br /><br />There are plenty of fascinating ideas in this book, but none of them are really developed, so they don't have a lot of impact.  Rather than focusing on a central theme, the work has a sprawling quality that in some ways diminishes it.  Not only are the two parts somewhat disjointed, but the individual parts themselves aren't unified so much as linear: one thing happens and then another without any feeling of cohesiveness.  Characters are introduced and then dropped a few pages later with scarcely another reference, even though they didn't actually do anything.<br /><br />The four-star recommendation is in recognition of the fact that Linebarger's short story collection The Rediscovery of Man adds levels of richness that the immediate text is lacking, and also because despite the book's obvious flaws, it still manages to be a pretty entertaining piece of sci-fi/fantasy.  It's a fun read, but it would be better if one has read The Rediscovery of Man first., who is trying to kill him? <br /> <br />There are plenty of fascinating ideas in this book, but none of them are really developed, so they don't have a lot of impact.

Ever imagine an America made up of small, isolated, self-sufficient villages that grow their own food and make their own decisions, and don't even give a thought to the world beyond the horizon?  Kim Stanley Robinson presents this as the wave of the future in this marvelous post-apocalyptic tale of Orange County, Ca.<br /><br />In the aftermath of a devastating nuclear surprise attack, America's social fabric has collapsed into chaos.  Fifty years later, the survivors have fallen into one of two patterns:  \\"Scavengers\\" have re-inhabited the destroyed cities and live off the remnants of past, squatting in buildings that survived and burning the neighboring homes for fuel, while others have started from scratch building new homes and new villages from natural materials available in California's newly grown woodlands.  The main conflict of the novel is between these two lifestyles, their attitude towards technology (what little remains of it), and their vastly different visions for America's future.<br /><br />The hero, young Hank Fletcher, lives in the small village of San Onofre.  His life consists of fishing, trapping, reading and occasionally hanging out with the few young people his age.  Robinson is at his best describing the natural beauty of life in this simple, almost primitive village, where everyone knows everybody else and they all do the best they can, not just for themselves, but for each other as well.  Despite the continual drudgery of working to stay alive, Onofre sounds like an idyllic place to live.  Into this pastoral paradise enter two strangers from out of town, who stir things up with talk of an American Resistance - a group that wants to re-unite the disconnected towns of the U.S. and fight against foreign incursions on American soil.  Hank is immediately caught up in their patriotic spirit, but not as much as his best friend Steve, who is chafing under the control of his strict and overprotective father.  The events that unfold thereafter make for a stirring adventure that never goes over the top into absurdity or mindless violence.<br /><br />Like Huckleberry Finn, this novel has elements of a \\"juvenile\\" but is really an adult book.  For one thing, Hank and Melissa get too physical (as well as too intoxicated) for this book to be read by children, although only younger teens will find much they haven't already experienced themselves.  For another, there are some fairly deep philosophical issues being addressed: the place of violence in society, the rights of the individual, personal responsibility, the value of history and literature, and whether technology is inherently immoral insofar as it takes humankind away from nature.<br /><br />Not only is this one of the most enjoyable books this reviewer has read in many years, it has a strong moral center that takes it beyond the ranks of humdrum escapist s-f.

Complicating Reich's plan is the danger of being detected by the so-called &quot;peepers&quot; - that tiny minority of persons who have developed the ability to read minds. So he hires an ambitious peeper to help him, and thus begins a fast-paced, intricately swirling cat and mouse game between Reich and Police Inspector (and peeper) Lincoln Powell. The stakes are high for all involved, and nobody plans to lose, least of all Reich, for whom conviction will surely mean Demolition. A superb sci-fi mystery thriller, with an edgy, cyber-punk feel that was far ahead of its time.<br /><br /> That said, potential readers should be warned of a couple minor weaknesses. As often happens in genre fiction, the characters fall somewhat short of full development. Reich's monomania is very convenient, but the less deranged characters are pretty unconvincing, mere pawns in the bigger game. And Bester's attempts to bring in some Freudian psychological insights are clumsy at best. After the thrill of the actual murder, and the extended chase that follows, the surprises at the end tend to fall a bit flat. At that, they fare better than the romantic subplot, which is handled so badly as to be plain irritating.<br /><br /> But this is top-notch science fiction, fans of which will quickly recognize this as a classic of the genre.	2004-07-29
US	49836087	R3CLLSAJZW25YJ	0670831328	299580684	The World of Nagaraj	Books	4	4	4	N	N	A gentle, everyday story about a quiet, simple man	Set in Narayan's fictional small Indian town of Malgudi, this story follows some significant events in the life of a quiet man named Nagaraj: a family man, born to modest wealth, a part-time accountant who is not too interested in money, a would-be writer obsessed with the ancient sage Narada, and perhaps ultimately, a failure.  Through his eyes we can experience the simple joys of small town life in South Asia, but we also gradually become acquainted with its frustrations.<br /><br />In Narayan's easy prose we follow Nagaraj about town on a typical day, enjoying the simple everyday pleasures that life holds for him, meeting people he knows, and hearing their stories before it's time to return home to his wife and pyol (balcony).  Over the course of time, we learn about his relationship with his disillusioned, but still dutiful wife Sita, his difficulties in raising his nephew Tim, and his ongoing attempts to write a biography of his beloved Narada.<br /><br />Most of all we come to know Nagaraj very well.  Although he has a touch of the intellectual about him, we soon discover that his reluctance to speak up for himself leads others to secretly view him with disdain.  This is especially evident in his relationship with his older brother Gophu, who regularly snubs and belittles him, despite the fact that Gophu's greatest accomplishment seems to revolve around the processing of methane gas on his farm.  But Gophu does possess an inner strength that is sadly lacking in Nagaraj.  We see too often how Nagaraj suppresses his real thoughts so as not to give offense to others, then utters inanities to mask his real feelings of irritation or even superiority.  This leads even his social inferiors to believe that he is merely a fool, when in actuality his real failing is not his intelligence, but a gentleness of the soul that sometimes seems to border on saintliness.  Indeed, he possesses some of the childlike simplicity that is often associated with the very religious, although his own religious leanings are modest, not fanatical.<br /><br />Nagaraj's problems have a faintly comic element to them, and to that extent the book is a rather amusing look at a very ineffectual man, but on another level, one can't help but sympathize with his difficulties.  If Nagaraj reminds you too much of someone you care very deeply about, this trip to Malgudi could be a very melancholy journey.s, although his own religious leanings are modest, not fanatical.     <br /> <br />Nagaraj's problems have a faintly comic element to them, and to that extent the book is a rather amusing look at a very ineffectual man, but on another level, one can't help but sympathize with his difficulties.

Among the works featured are the groundbreaking inter-species love story &quot;The Lovers&quot;, the nightmarish &quot;Night of Light&quot;, the stunningly dystopian &quot;Riders of the Purple Wage&quot;, the majestic adventures of the Riverworld series, and the ribald &quot;Venus on the Half-Shell&quot;. Beyond this we get very little, which is a shame, since so much of Farmer's best work was either ignored, or written after Brizzi's book. Quite apart from the extreme and quite undeserved brevity of the work, a broader critical focus would have been an improvement. Brizzi does a good enough job cataloguing images, and relating themes, and suggesting associations for proper names, but one can't help but wish for more pointed analysis. If each chapter of this book were an English paper (Brizzi is a professor at Kent State) one would be tempted to ask &quot;What is your thesis here? What do these accumulated details actually tell us about the author and/or the book?&quot; Moreover, some variety in critical approach would have made a welcome change, as well. And if Farmer's works simply didn't stand up to Feminist, Marxist, or Christological criticism (to name just a few possibilities) then perhaps they aren't really as important as her glowing treatments would lead us to believe. The best part of this book was the section of biographical information, which though interesting, was far too brief. Students of genre fiction might find use for the listing of critical essays that are suggested for further reading, but there isn't much of any value in this slight volume.	2004-07-24

The protagonist, no-longer-youthful British officer Guy Crouchback, is assigned as liaison to a group of Yugoslav partisans, and finds himself involved in the plight of a group of desperate Jewish refugees.  On the Home Front, Guy re-unites with his ex-wife Virginia (for whom he still has strong feelings) but can she provide him with a hoped-for heir, or will she die like the character in Ludovic's novel, forcing Guy to seek love and happiness elsewhere?<br />Early in the book, Guy's father admonishes that \\"if only one soul is saved, that is full compensation\\" and this seems to be the real point of the author's story, and ultimately of the entire trilogy: after all the nonsense, the foolishness, the failures, and even the horror, just one single act of mercy can be enough to account for a wasted life.  This hope for a final justification lends an optimistic tone to a book that is otherwise filled with the death and destruction of the bombing of London, but it also ties together the various themes that the trilogy has focused on: the senselessness of war, the relevance (or irrelevance) of Catholicism, and the manifest follies and inequities of modern Britain and Western culture generally.  If the first two volumes of this series seemed a little too light and pointless, this book is where it all really pays off.  A strong statement about how one man makes sense of an increasingly senseless world.	2004-07-17

True, the wizard wore a lab coat rather than a pointed hat, and the hero flew a rocket ship instead of riding a white horse, but at essence, they were the same types: flat, flawless, and wholly unbelievable.  Budrys explodes the myth in this painfully honest look at what drives the kind of man who would risk his life, and the lives of others, in the name of Science.<br />Dr Edward Hawks heads a project that, through the miracle of teleportation, puts men on the moon.  He does this by transmitting taped copies of human beings across the void, where the men are then reconstructed alive from this data.  Communication is handled by an inherent psychic link between the original and his copy.  With unique insight, Budrys sees this journey as a one-way trip, since the men so sent are mere duplicates of their earth-side counterparts, with no lives of their very own to come back to.  Thus Hawks' machine creates life, but it is life that has no real place in our world.<br />While exploring the moon, these doomed men have found an inexplicable artifact.  Attempts to enter this structure and learn its secrets have always resulted in the demise of the explorer.  And staying in constant contact with &quot;themselves&quot; as they die again and again has taken a tragic toll upon even the hardened military men whose avatars are doing the investigating.  So Director of Personnel Vincent Connington chooses fearless tough guy adventurer Al Barker for the job.  But how will Al react to not just facing death, but actually experiencing it, dying day after day?  And what of his beautiful and flirtatious girlfriend Claire, whose coquettish ways threaten to undermine the entire project?  If life is this cheap, then how valuable are relationships?<br />Originally published in the early sixties, perhaps in response to the Nedelin catastrophe in which 126 people were killed on a Soviet launch pad, this short but strangely gripping novel focuses on the people who undertake dangerous ventures, rather than on the science behind this sketchily-drawn quest.  The point of view usually lies with Hawks, and his relationships with Al, whom he sends to his death on a daily basis, and Claire, who seems anxious to shatter his inscrutable composure.  Fans of whiz-bang science fiction may be disappointed by the fairly weak and dated explanations of the science involved, and the fact that many of the more scientific questions remain unresolved at the end.  But despite the outrageousness of the back story, this is a unique, gripping, and very hard-boiled book that takes a hard if somewhat simplistic look at what drives the people who do dangerous work.ow valuable are relationships?  <br />Originally published in the early sixties, perhaps in response to the Nedelin catastrophe in which 126 people were killed on a Soviet launch pad, this short but strangely gripping novel focuses on the people who undertake dangerous ventures, rather than on the science behind this sketchily-drawn quest.

On the distant planet Garth, an alien race called the Gubru attacks the Terran colonials, not only hoping to discredit the human race, but to raise their own status in a complex galactic power play.  After the human colonists are quickly subdued by sophisticated gas weapons, the resistance has to come from their \\"uplifted clients\\": the intelligence-augmented chimpanzees who are conquering space at the side of their patrons.  Badly outgunned by the invaders, the chimps can use help from any ally they can find, including the possibly-mythical original inhabitants of the planet, the Garthlings.  The protagonist, a chimp named Fiben, is very nicely drawn, exhibiting remarkably human behavior, but with occasional hints of his animal nature showing through.  His escapade in the nightclub is particularly memorable.  A magnificent sci-fi adventure for adults as well as mid-to-older teens.<br />It probably isn't necessary to read the two previous volumes of this trilogy to enjoy this novel; Sundiver is a rambling jumble of a book, and only provides the most general type of background for the next two, and while Startide Rising opens a lot of the issues that are being pursued here, the focus is on a completely different battle in the greater war, and tends to get bogged down by the trinary poetry that is spoken by the uplifted dolphin race.  But after all, if you're a fan of Brin's particular brand of galactic intrigue, you may as well begin at the beginning, since sooner or later you'll probably want to read these books anyway.<br />For the more discriminating reader, this novel is a little more tightly controlled than Startide, managing to keep its twists and turns within the context of the immediate story, instead spending most of its pages setting up larger issues for future volumes.  There are plenty of surprises, but again, some editing could have made this a tighter and more thoroughly enjoyable book.  Also, a warning: for the concluding book of a trilogy, this volume provides very little in the way of answers to the broader questions presented in Startide Rising.  One hopes that the Second Uplift trilogy will provide some closure on these bigger issues.k.

That's right, folks, all the citizens of the land of Ledom are functionally both male and female and consequently there are no longer two different sexes.  Charlie's (and our) guide is a man/woman named Philos, a historian who wants Charlie's unbiased opinion about their utopia.  At Charlie's side, we learn about Ledom's architecture, its clothing styles, its scientific achievements, its educational system, its worship of children, and of course, its total lack of sexually-derived problems, a theme that is driven home again and again.<br />For contrast, there are brief interludes that provide snapshots of life in 1950's-era America.  These scenes invariably point out the failings in 20th Century society that the Ledom have ostensibly solved by abandoning two separate sexes.  Many involve the subtle and almost harmless-seeming ways in which women are subjugated to men.  Of course in today's climate of political correctness, many of these practices are dying out, but when this book was written in 1960, Sturgeon was expressing some pretty radical notions, (i.e. that financial competition between men was fundamentally sexual, or that it was not necessarily \\"natural\\" that a woman's place was in the home).  There isn't much shock value in this book today, but it was the general availability of ideas like these that led to the massive social changes of the '60's and early '70's.<br />As the story is told from Charlie's point of view, we readily sympathize with his confusion, his loneliness, and his fear in this radically alien environment.  Where is he?  When is he?  What happened to the world that he spent his life in?  And what hope does he have of ever getting back?  The gradual unraveling of these mysteries provides the tension that drives this fairly short novel.  Not short enough, perhaps, since the lack of action and thinness of the characters wears pretty quickly.  Skillful as Sturgeon is at making his point, he rarely manages to capture this reviewer's imagination.  The beginning and middle sections of this book both seemed unnecessarily slow.  Only toward the very end does the plot pick up as Charlie starts getting closer to finding out the truth about Ledom.<br />As is too often the case with Sturgeon's novels, he comes up with a truly brilliant idea for a story, but stretches it beyond his own ability to keep it interesting.  Fans of \\"classic\\" science fiction will enjoy this novel, and those whose gender consciousness needs raising may find this book enlightening; but for the most part, time has caught up with the ideas in this book, and it isn't successful enough as an entertainment to stand without their psycho-social punch.lack of action and thinness of the characters wears pretty quickly.

More a historical summary than an artistic statement, Wolfe examines how socio-economic forces led to the formation of the European art compounds of the twenties, and follows how they led to the state of architecture in America as it existed when this book was written, at the close of the 1970's.  The major players are portrayed as arrogant, untalented, and self-serving theorists who have no interest in pleasing the hard-working, money-grubbing bourgeoisie, who after all, are paying to have these structures built, and there is no attempt to garner our sympathy by humanizing them in any way.  Fans of Wolfe will already be familiar with this formula, and may still appreciate his caustic views on the topic, but this book is rather too superficial to be good scholarship, and as entertainment, it's only as captivating as its subject matter.<br />As a writer, Wolfe is Wolfe, and can not be faulted for his irreverent style, his mastery of sarcasm, and his delightful ability to ferret out anything that smells of authoritarian doubletalk.  Himself a master of the written word, he is never shy about ridiculing the nonsense that has often passed for scholarship in this field, but is this the fault of the writers, or merely an inadequacy of language itself?  As Frank Zappa has pointed out, &quot;writing about music is like dancing about architecture&quot;, and writing about architecture probably can't be much more effective. A structure has to be seen to be appreciated, and the dozen or so plates included in this book seem far too few for so essentially visual a medium.  In particular, Wolfe's basic premise, that all the architecture of the past fifty years is dull and repetitive, would have been better served by page after page of ugly, cookie-cutter building projects that passed as great architecture.<br />Disclaimer: no one old enough to actually remember the seventies has any less knowledge of modern architecture than this reviewer, who not only has relatively little interest in the subject, but is notoriously unobservant at the macro level, generally.  The relevance, of course, is that anyone who has strong opinions (positive or negative) about modern architecture, or any architecture, for that matter, will surely find this book more interesting than I did.ny less knowledge of modern architecture than this reviewer, who not only has relatively little interest in the subject, but is notoriously unobservant at the macro level, generally.

In this particular volume, he puts a science-fiction overlay on some very traditional gothic horror themes, in the context of a classic detective novel, but don't go thinking you've seen this before.  Forget that Farmer's explanations of lycanthrope and vampirism are much further out than anything you've heard previously, because that's not even the tip of the iceberg.  What really sets this book apart from the crowd is the infusion of bizarre (often inhuman) sexuality that goes well beyond anything in the annals of science fiction.  This isn't just the obligatory sex scene to make a weak book marketable - the wild, sadistic, and often scary sex is almost the main thrust of the book.<br />Harold Childe isn't exactly the typical hard-boiled private investigator who is so essential to the detective genre, although he's pretty close.  But the videotape of his partner's murder is anything but typical, and when he fights through the acid-smog of L.A. to the mansion of a rich eccentric, the reader quickly becomes aware that this is not your father's detective novel.  Fans already know that Farmer has a real gift for telling action tales, but how many suspected he was capable of dreaming up such twisted sexual fantasies - many of them terrifying, many of them disgusting, and all of them completely over the top?<br />The main novel in this book, Image of the Beast, is pretty powerful stuff - a brutal murder, a cynical detective, a misery-laden city, a haunted mansion, extra-terrestrials, deviant sexual behavior - something for everyone, really.  By itself, it might rate four stars for sheer audacity if only it had a legitimate ending.  Sadly, this story has more loose ends than a shag carpet, and the sequel, originally published as the longish short story \\"Blown\\", is just plain silly.  Farmer gets away from slam/bang action and the detective format, and starts bringing in references to Byron and Joan of Arc, all to no real purpose.<br />The three star rating reflects the fact that this book is so unlike anything else this reviewer has ever read, that one might be willing to overlook some of its obvious flaws just on the basis of originality, or perhaps more accurately, audacity.  The prudish, the squeamish, and the conventionally logical will probably not like this book at all.  Recommended only for adult genre fans who aren't afraid to step through a twisted looking glass.es to Byron and Joan of Arc, all to no real purpose.<br />The three star rating reflects the fact that this book is so unlike anything else this reviewer has ever read, that one might be willing to overlook some of its obvious flaws just on the basis of originality, or perhaps more accurately, audacity.

He recognizes her considerable natural gifts, and takes her home to be queen of Brenden Weyr.  Unlike most of the inhabitants of the planet Pern, F'lar and Leesa believe the ancient ballads that foretell the coming of the Threads - a calamitous rain of death that comes from the sky every 200 years.  It having been almost 400 years since the last attack, most people believe that the Threads have ceased, or are mere legends that never happened at all, and that the elaborate ongoing defensive preparations are mere idle rituals of the distant past, which more and more are being abandoned.  Can Leesa and F'lar convince the people of the error of their ways, and fight off the coming attack of the all-consuming Threads?<br />The whole argument about sci-fi vs. fantasy is probably not that important, although it can be interesting, and this book makes for a good test case.  McCaffrey has done an excellent job of using the tropes of fantasy: an armored warrior class, their daring and headstrong Queen, fire-breathing dragons, a medieval social structure, age-old prophecies, etc..., and giving them just enough historical and scientific background to make them credible.  It seems a little too much to call this science fiction - the scientific explanations given are rarely more than a sentence or two, and they in no way dominate the story; but at the same time the very fact that there are explanations puts this book beyond the realm of garden-variety fantasy.  There's no magic at work here - this story takes place in a logical universe where everything that happens does so for a reason.<br />McCaffrey's prose is sometimes a touch awkward, especially towards the beginning of the book, but it's still much easier reading than Tolkien or Cherryh, and the length is not intimidating, although there is a whole series of sequels available to those who want more (and many surely will).  This novel is an excellent selection for teens, particularly young women, who may find Leesa easier to identify with than the standard fantasy hero.  For them, this should be considered a 5-star selection.reading than Tolkien or Cherryh, and the length is not intimidating, although there is a whole series of sequels available to those who want more (and many surely will).

Because Woolf was always pushing the envelope of what a novel was, many of her books are very difficult to read.  The Waves is probably the most difficult read this reviewer (and student of literature) has ever encountered.<br />The lives of six friends are presented from childhood in a series of interior monologues.  There's a glacial slowness that challenges our yen for action, and the episodic nature of the book (covering decades) is not really designed to hold our attention.  The point of the book is in how its characters perceive themselves and each other, but since we never get \\"outside\\" to form an objective opinion, it's difficult to care what's going to happen next.  Maybe that's good, because there's only one significant event that transpires during this long novel (a sad death), and if there's even the slightest hint of humor in the book, this reviewer missed it.<br />Other \\"modern\\" novelists, such as William Faulkner, propose that each of us has our own unique inner voice, and they try to make their characters' interior monologues reflect these differences.  But Woolf implies that these inner voices are all the same, or at least all six of these characters inner voices are all the same, perhaps by virtue of certain similarities in their environment.  Or was it merely a shortage of imagination (or, dare one suggest, technique?) on the part of the author?  In any case, this reviewer found that the sameness of the six characters' narrative voices tended to overpower the fact that they each had their own individual lives and personalities.<br />Lest one get the wrong impression, this is indeed a beautiful book.  Woolf's prose has a sonorous quality that borders on poetry, yet is so exhausting that it's hard to get through more than a few pages at a sitting.  The first few dozen pages are especially trying, since we are never formally introduced to the characters, and it takes some time before their personalities are established.<br />Some critics consider The Waves Virginia Woolf's masterpiece, and certainly it is the most extreme example of the interior monologue she ever produced.  But because this review is for the general public rather than the literary press, I can not in good conscience recommend this book.  Certainly it's a novel you'll either love or hate, and since you're reading reviews of Virginia Woolf novels, there's at least a chance you'll love it, but I'm giving it two stars, since despite its merits, the average man-on-the street won't get through 10 pages of it.  Add one star if you are female, since you are likely more interested in the subtleties of human relationships than most men.  Add another star if you majored in English at college, and one more if you've done graduate work in English.  Satisfied?  For the rest of us, Woolf's To the Lighthouse is a warm, delightful novel about art and family and the passage of time that nearly everyone should enjoy.ore than a few pages at a sitting.

Published in 1982, almost twenty years after the events that are discussed in these pages, this book should be something of an historical document.  Unfortunately, Smith shows himself to be a pretty soft interviewer, at least by today's standards.  Although he speaks to such luminaries as Ronald Reagan, Julian Bond, George Wallace, John Chancellor, Billy Graham, Jerry Rubin, and Richard Nixon, they provide no more insight than Smith's old school chums and former teachers.  Maybe it's because in the long run, these men were more concerned about maintaining their legacies than in digging up the truth.  In his search for meaning, lessons, significance, or even consequences of the period in question, Smith seems to have come up empty - to put it in newsman's terms, there's no story here.  Students who are researching the period might find some good quotes in this book, but they will find nothing in the way of new  perspectives.	2004-02-15

Mr. Morel, a coal miner in turn-of-the-century Britain, lives a life of drudgery, anger and desperation.  He takes his frustrations out on his wife Gertrude, while the real source of his unhappiness is his own low self-esteem.  Gertrude is embittered by his hardness and so looks to her sons to fill all her emotional needs.  This constitutes Part One of the novel, which to this reviewer's taste is the more satisfying section.  The detailed descriptions of the arguments and even outright fights between the married couple are as powerful as anything in fiction, and bleakly dramatize how poverty can destroy the very hearts and souls of the working classes.  Morel is oppressed by his employer, so he in turn oppresses his wife, who emotionally smothers her sons.  Fight the power!<br />All of which is what makes Part Two such a disappointment.  The entire second half of the book revolves around the second son, Paul, and how his closeness to his mother makes it impossible for him to engage in satisfactory relationships with other women.  Miriam, the milquetoast who yearns for a transcendent, spiritual love, cares for Paul so much that she lets him walk all over her.  The much tougher and independent Clara introduces Paul to a more physically satisfying relationship, but neither of them has any real attachment to the other.  The weakness of this second half is not just that it all seems to take far too long; it's that over time, the characters become very unsympathetic.  None of them have the strength of will to break away from their failing relationships, despite the fact that these failures cast dark shadows across their lives.  And there's certainly nothing tragic about these young people mooning about, complaining that their relationships aren't what they'd like them to be; most especially in the context of Part One, which reminds us that there are people in this world who are really suffering.<br />Readers who are deeply interested in the internal subtleties of male-female relationships (and this probably includes a majority of young women) will love this book.  If the two parts were published separately, this reviewer would unhesitatingly give Part One five stars, while grudgingly giving Part Two three and a half.  For Mama's boys (and those who've seriously dated them) this book certainly rates five stars, but others will find these characters so annoying that even four stars may seem generous.in this world who are really suffering.<br />Readers who are deeply interested in the internal subtleties of male-female relationships (and this probably includes a majority of young women) will love this book.

John Berry is a Boston pathologist who has been helping to cover up the illegal abortions performed by a Dr. Arthur Lee.  When Lee is arrested for murder, Berry has to unravel the case before the consequences of his own actions catch up with him.  There's a lot of the technical medical terminology that Crichton has made popular on the hit TV show \\"ER\\", and a lot more of the serious analysis of the moral dilemmas that face medical practitioners in the real world, particularly as they relate to abortion.  Like \\"ER\\" this is not science fiction, but a very compelling story (actually a murder mystery) informed by substantial scientific knowledge.  (Crichton was a medical student at the time this novel was written).  As such, there is no speculation here, just the facts as Crichton sees them, in the context of a juicy potboiler that includes licentiousness and loose living among the rich and privileged.  The end result is a thoroughly compelling can't-put-it-down page-turner that seems certain to please a mass audience.<br />The down side is that apart from the (admittedly even-handed) discussions on abortion, there really isn't any substance to this novel.  The characters are pretty generic, and only the hero really manages to make any claim on our sympathy.  Mystery lovers are sure to enjoy this book, as are fans of \\"ER\\", but science fiction fans should not be expecting to find any far-out ideas here.  Very entertaining, but not mind-boggling, this book will raise your consciousness about the abortion issue.  Just don't expect a whole lot more from it.	2004-02-13

An unidentified blip approaching North America appears on an automated tracking system.  Is this the long-feared attack, or just another in an endless series of false alarms?  Rather than find out after it's too late, the bombers are once again sent out, none of them certain if it's just another drill, or the real thing.  But this time a mechanical failure in the automated system causes the bombers to go beyond their Fail Safe points, past which there is no return.  Should we go ahead and launch an incapacitating first strike, since retaliation is assured anyway?  Or do we help the enemy to shoot down our own planes, hoping to avert nuclear holocaust?<br />Among the cast of spare-drawn characters is Peter Buck, a natural linguist who is the White House's Russian translator despite his acute disinterest in politics, General Bogan, commanding officer of the information center known as the War Room, Colonel Cascio, who can't quite escape the poverty of his working-class roots, Lieutenant Colonel Grady, commander of a group of Vindicator bombers, and the President, who is faced with a situation that could win the Cold War - or destroy human civilization.  The action takes place amidst the bomber group and in the War Room, but especially in the calculating minds of the men charged with making the most dangerous of all possible decisions.<br />As one might expect from a forty-year-old novel, the technology is rather out of date, but the moral lesson is as strong as ever.  Every system, no matter how redundant, will eventually break down, making nuclear weapons far too dangerous to keep around.  The president's final, grim decision is a lesson in moral courage, but even that may be insufficient in the dangerous years ahead, as nuclear proliferation continues.  Written very convincingly in simple and straightforward prose, this book is not so much an entertainment as a call for political action.

In the destined-to-be-a-classic \\"Fire Watch\\" a time-traveling history student gets too involved while studying the London Blitz.  Other top-notch entries include the shocking \\"All My Darling Daughters\\" which describes an off-planet boarding school that teaches young men a unique lesson in relationships, \\"A Letter from the Clearys\\", a sad and moving tale of post-apocalyptic America, and \\"The Sidon in the Mirror\\" which tells the tragic story of a drifter who copies the personality traits of others.  Each of these stories is powerful, pointed, and offers a unique vision of some aspect of life in the future.<br />A little less intense, but still of very good quality are \\"Lost and Found\\" which invokes the Second Coming, \\"Daisy in the Sun\\" showing how life goes on, even with extinction hanging over us, and \\"Samaritan\\" which describes a minister who must make a difficult decision about a church's trained orangutan.  Each of these stories is sure to do more than merely please.<br />Rounding out the collection, Willis offers \\"Service for the Burial of the Dead\\", about guilt and loss and a lover who dies too soon, \\"The Father of the Bride\\", a silly addendum to a classic fairy tale, \\"And Come from Miles Around\\" wherein a mother observes the observers at an eclipse (but no one else does), \\"Mail-Order Clone\\", an inane tale of a customer who is dissatisfied with his mail-order purchase, and \\"Blued Moon\\" a truly unique story showing how a chemical company's discharge has bizarre effects on human behavior.  Many of this last group are intended to be humorous, and perhaps shouldn't be classified as science fiction at all, but most are at least entertaining.<br />Fans of the author will be very pleased with this collection.

Ratliff matches wits with hard-headed businessman Flem Snopes and his ubiquitous relatives in this smoothly interwoven series of tales from Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi.  The Snopes Saga continues with The Town and The Mansion, but neither of these books are nearly as sardonically humorous, and this first volume ends neatly enough that the unimpressed reader can stop right there.  But most readers will be captivated by Faulkner's yarns of the horse-trading, deal-making, penny-pinching folk who inhabit Frenchman's Bend.<br />Faulkner uses these stories to reflect how the naivet&eacute; of the Old South allowed it to fall victim to a species of social infestation somewhere around the turn of the century.  Flem Snopes is not exactly the hero of this book; he is mean, miserly, graceless, and unprincipled, but he does have a distinct knack for making money, and his inexorable rise seems to indicate that he is by some standards the smartest man in the village.  Of course Faulkner can't help but try to show us how much the glory of the Old South gets lost in the process: courtesy, honor, common decency, and public responsibility.  Snopes doesn't care who get hurt, so long as he comes out ahead in the deal.<br />Faulkner's often difficult prose is easier to follow in this novel than in some of his others, and absent the bizarre experiments with point of view that he's noted for, most readers should find this book sometimes rambling and long-winded, but not incomprehensible.  As an example of folksy Southern humor, this one is more seriously pointed than his nostalgic reminiscence The Reivers, but not as grimly dark as his black comedy As I Lay Dying, and really shouldn't be missed.  As is always the case with Faulkner, the women-folk may consider themselves excused.	2004-02-06

After divorcing his first wife, simple, dependable, white-bread Archibald Jones marries a half-black Jamaican woman and renews his acquaintance with Samad Iqbal, his old war buddy.  Archie and Clara have a daughter, Irie, an intelligent, ambitious girl who nevertheless finds herself a social outcast.  The Iqbals, &eacute;migr&eacute;s from Bangladesh, (formerly Bengal), suffer from a serious case of culture clash, which lends this book much of its satiric bite.  Samad wishes to preserve his proud Bengali heritage and pass it on to his twin sons, Millat and Magid, but finds his efforts thwarted by the corrupting power of North London society.<br />None of these people really fit in, and their efforts to pull through anyway make us want to cheer them on despite the silliness and hypocrisy we see in them.  Enough family history is spelled out to make us realize how much each of these people are programmed by attitudes and events that held sway before they were even born.  Some of it seems ludicrous, much of it is irrational, but being the past, it can't be escaped.  Do we even have choices, or are our lives predetermined by accident of birth?<br />This novel asks us to examine the question of how the individual fits into society, and at what point our own inner need to express our individuality (as well as our heritage) becomes a detriment - not only to society, but to ourselves because of society's reaction to us.  With the introduction of the super-mouse, a product of modern genetic engineering, Smith seems to be championing (or is she skewering?) the unpopular notion that only through greater uniformity can we ever hope to overcome mankind's seemingly innate tendency to hate and fear anyone who seems different - that if disappearance is the price one pays for assimilation, then let's pay up and before even one more child grows up hating herself because she doesn't look like the girls in the magazines.  A delightful ride on a post-modernist roller-coaster, with memorable characters, delicious dialogue, and plenty of serious points to make.

The first volume, Sundiver, is only notable for introducing the concept of the Uplift - the idea that a scientifically advanced race will eventually learn enough about genetic engineering that they'll be able to \\"uplift\\" other species to higher levels of intelligence.  An entire galactic civilization is presented wherein uplift is a common practice, and a species' status is based on the number of \\"client\\" races they have successfully uplifted.<br />Startide Rising features a spaceship crewed primarily by dolphins, although there are some men and a chimpanzee scientist also on board.  This particular crew has accidentally stumbled upon an ancient secret that will shake galactic politics to its foundations, although they don't really understand the implications themselves.  What is clear is that a wild assortment of alien races are after this ship, and have forced it to land on an out of the way planet in order to take what they want.<br />Unlike Sundiver, which stood pretty much on its own, this book is explicitly part of a larger series.  Lots of questions about an overall galactic conflict are never resolved in this novel and while a complete story is told, there is no shortage of loose ends that could be picked up in further sequels, notably volume three, The Uplift War.  Perhaps the greatest shortcoming of this installment is that Brin seems satisfied to develop the ideas introduced in Sundiver, rather than present more exciting new concepts.<br />And while Brin's ideas and imagination are exceptional, the same can't be said about his writing, which still shows flaws in this, only his second novel.  In particular, his tendency to overcomplicate gets away from him here, causing him to create too many characters and lose focus on the essential pieces of his story.  He tries to control this problem through the technique of breaking the novel into over 100 subchapters, each named after the character whose point of view we are seeing.  This not only helps us keep track of the different plot threads that each character is pursuing, but also keeps this longish novel engaging even through the long middle section.  But the characters themselves are not very memorable - perhaps one should give Brin credit for being able to give a dolphin any personality at all, and never mind a two-dimensional one.

The plot moves very slowly, especially in the first half, and is largely subservient to the subtle shifts in relationships between the characters, whose thoughts and feelings are often examined in depth.  Without spoiling any surprises, Margaret and Helen Schlegel are two independent young women in pre-war Britain whose lives are thrown into turmoil by a series of seemingly random interactions with the very wealthy and very conservative Wilcox family.  After a very brief tryst with one of the Wilcox brothers (during which Mrs. Munt provides some welcome comic relief) the sisters are stunned to find the Wilcoxes moving into their neighborhood.  A friendship develops between Margaret and Mrs. Wilcox, which though short, has long-lasting consequences.  In the second half of the book, Margaret is faced with the task of reconciling her flighty liberal-minded sister Helen with the very practical down-to-earth conservatism of Henry Wilcox.<br />It's only fair to point out that many men will find this novel melancholy and occasionally downright insipid.  The relationship between Margaret and her prospective husband is utterly lacking in warmth or even in humanity, and his decision about the disposition of the house around the middle of the book is so contemptible that one just wants him to go away.  Indeed none of the male characters are the least bit admirable, and only the hapless Leonard Bast is even sympathetic.  The obsession with a sense of place that is at this novel's core is neither sufficiently enchanting nor adequately believable.  And the final resolution has been roundly criticized by feminists who see the once-proud sisters settling into exactly the sort of lives that they hadn't wanted for themselves.  It's true that Margaret is able to convince her husband of the importance of the \\"inner life\\", but only at the price of his virtual destruction, leaving her, like Helen, caring for a helpless infant.  As to Forster's famous aphorism \\"only connect\\", the only characters who really unite on a spiritual level are Margaret and a woman who dies fairly early on in the story.<br />But for most women, this is one of the finest books in the literary canon.  Forster's language is superb, and his insight into the female mind is impressive, but what really sets this novel apart is its excursions into the philosophical concerns of modern society.  What responsibilities do the rich have to the poor, and how should these responsibilities best be discharged?  How do personal relationships fit into the context of a social order that needs leaders, builders, and entrepreneurs?  Is the unexamined life really not worth living, or does self-analysis too often result in dilettantism and paralysis?  Forster not only raises these questions, but debates them at some length, making this book a perfect choice for an English class or a book discussion group.

US	49836087	R2VV4WL0FFO0KC	0553293370	834333861	Foundation and Empire	Books	5	1	1	N	N	The Golden Age Classic Continues	Asimov's Golden Age classic Foundation Trilogy is one of the early milestones of the science fiction genre.  This second installment is less episodic than the first volume, focusing on just two specific stories.  The first volume, &quot;Foundation&quot;, sets up the whole idea of the Seldon Plan, a mathematically based view of sociopolitical forces that enables one brilliant scientist to grow a new galactic empire from a foundation of one hundred thousand scientists and their families.  &quot;Empire&quot; starts off in the same vein, showing how the Foundation staves off annihilation at the hands of the currently decaying, but still dangerous Galactic Empire.  Once again, the magic of this section is the subtle means by which the Foundation overcomes impossible odds, and the convincing arguments Asimov uses to make the solution seem inevitable.  Part Two involves an internal struggle between the Foundation's authoritarian central government and the Independent Traders who spread that government's economic power.  While the Foundation is threatened with civil war, the rise of a new warlord on Kalgan poses a danger to the entire human race.<br />Because each story is substantially longer than those in Foundation, this volume focuses more on individual characters.  In fact, it is not too much to say that a major theme is the historical question, \\"Do individuals matter?\\"  As a result, the characters are developed slightly more, and there's even a wistful love triangle, and considerably more action than was featured in the first volume, which tended to be distant and impersonal.  If you liked Foundation, you'll surely enjoy this and the climax to the series, Second Foundation.<br />Although these books will strike many as hopelessly dated, Asimov's sweeping historical vision should not be missed by any fans of speculative fiction.  They have a directness and honest charm about them that is rare in contemporary science fiction.  Later additions to this series, both sequels and prequels, don't adhere to the tone of these original novels, and really add very little except bulk.s and prequels, don't adhere to the tone of these original novels, and really add very little except bulk.	2003-12-23

Skipping the first volume (The Shadow of the Torturer) is not recommended - this series is difficult enough to follow even for those who read every page.  References to events that took place earlier are explained only in the briefest detail.<br />In this volume, Severian's uneasy allegiance to both the Autarch and the mysterious revolutionary named Vodalus is severely tested.  While journeying to Thrax where his guild has a position awaiting him, he takes part in the brutal execution of an innocent woman, has a mysterious assignation with his late beloved Thecla, battles a horde of man-apes, is captured by Volalus, participates in the bizarre sharing ceremony of the alzabo, and suffers a lengthy imprisonment before a portentous encounter in the picture room at the House Absolute, among other adventures.<br />Once again, Wolfe uses language to create the other-worldly locale, employing archaic words to describe objects that are common enough on \\"Urth\\", but are unfamiliar to us.  And even though the practical-minded Severian frequently doesn't seem to react to the astounding things he sees and experiences, most readers will find themselves intrigued, even though the question \\"What does it all mean?\\" remains unresolved.<br />Like the first volume, this book is pretty light stuff - pure escapism, with no real point or depth of human insight apparent, but it is still a quick, enjoyable read.  The fictional narrator foreshadows great things in Severian's future, and presumably the succeeding books will show an overall plan and sense of purpose that this novel lacks in and of itself.  The violence and sexual content of these books makes this series unsuitable for young teens, but fans of this kind of pseudo-medieval fantasy should be very pleased indeed.	2003-12-14

Ender's Game is a bildungsroman, or coming of age story, of a very young military genius, Ender Wiggin.  At the tender age of six, Ender is recruited by the powers-that-be for battle training in hopes that he can be molded into the leader who will destroy the dreaded alien invaders<br />It may be helpful to compare this book to Robert Heinlein's classic Starship Troopers, which has some broad similarities of plot.  Troopers has strong a basis in the sciences, both military and social.  Card leans more toward fantasy; his real fascination is with human beings and their feelings, not with the technical details of how the hardware works.  So if you're the kind of sci-fi fan who reads a book hoping to learn something about physics, dig out an old Asimov book instead - Card's not your man.  Also, the hero in the typical Heinlein juvenile is not only super-smart (like Ender's characters) but they are often \\"gee-whiz\\", \\"can-do\\" types for whom everything always seems to just fall into place.  Ender, on the other hand, is often conflicted, frequently miserable, and constantly manipulated.  One reason this book is so long is that Ender seldom has an easy victory - instead he has to fight his battles over and over until he finally wins.  And while Heinlein's ing&eacute;nues always have an older comrade to mentor them, Ender is intentionally forced to learn everything the hard way - by himself.<br />Card is so skillful at making us sympathize with poor Ender's plight that we can't wait to see him jump the next hurdle.  We care about his fate with an intensity that is almost unknown in genre fiction, which is probably why so many reviewers claim that this novel is really serious literature.  While that seems a bit much, there's no denying that for sheer entertainment value, this book beats 3 out of 4 \\"literary classics\\".  Accessible enough for younger readers, but too intense for children, this is a book that practically everyone will enjoy.

But as longtime Heinlein readers must already suspect, Baslim has capabilities that far outweigh his physical infirmities.  While teaching Thorby his own profession, he sets a plan in motion to find Thorby's real family.  After a thrilling escape from the slave planet, Thorby finds a new family in a merchant trader ship, where the duties and customs are unlike anything he has ever seen.  Next he joins the Guards, where still further efforts are made to find Thorby's origins.  When he is finally restored to his nearest relatives, Thorby finds himself facing still more challenges, as things are not what they seem at the Rudbek household.  Will Thorby ever find happiness?  And is it possible to ever be truly free?<br />Heinlein's extensive firsthand knowledge of military science and shipboard routine serves him  in good stead once again in this fascinating juvenile.  He is somewhat less entertaining when trying to discuss big business dealings in the second half of the novel, but there is still a sufficiently subversive element to keep us interested in Thorby's fate.  And while Thorby grows up quite a bit during the course of the story, this is still a boys' book.  Numerous girls get thrown in Thorby's  path at various stages, but he remains wholly oblivious, focused as he is own his own problems.  And as is typical of Heinlein, these young women are not just hapless victims - some of them exercise real power within their respective realms.  So young women interested in social sci-fi may find this book entertaining as well.<br />Heinlein's heroes are often super-smart under-achievers who find themselves thrown into new environments where they doesn't understand the rules, and Thorby is no exception.  Here the process is repeated several times, and we spend more pages adjusting to the next new social situation than we do studying scientific principles, so devotees of hard science may find this one rather light fare.  But for those who love to look at alternate social structures, and try to understand the logic underlying each, this book is an entertaining exercise in cultural relativity, and easily ranks among the best of Heinlein's juveniles.n than we do studying scientific principles, so devotees of hard science may find this one rather light fare.

Using a stream-of-consciousness technique that was pretty radical for its time, Woolf bounces us from the mind of one character to another in sometimes erratic fashion, presenting a multi-faceted view of a single day in post-WWI London.<br />The focus is on Clarissa and the grand party she is throwing that particular evening, but as her thoughts frequently hearken back to the past, we gradually learn her life's story, even as participants in that story make appearances in \\"real time\\".  Peter, just back from India, still has strong feelings about her, despite the many years since she broke off their love affair.  Sally, the brazen, independent woman who Clarissa so much admired, also puts in an unexpected appearance, and some may wonder if a romantic attachment might have also played a role in their relationship.  Clarissa's husband Richard is something of disappointment, neither as successful as his contemporaries or as passionate as the now-unattached Peter.  Will this confluence of faces from her past be enough to shake Clarissa out of her despondency?<br />A major sub-plot revolves around a young WWI veteran named Septimus who is also obsessed by the past.  Seeing visions of his late comrade-in-arms, Septimus finds it difficult to deal with the realities of everyday life.  His wife, tormented by his inexplicable behavior, wants to get him medical help, but her husband fears these threats to his freedom even more than death.  Will her love be enough to save him?<br />The intersection of these two plots is not overly dramatic, but in light of the facts of Woolf's own demise, the effect of one upon the other should not be overlooked.  The novel bears more than a hint of social criticism, blaming the patriarchal culture for Clarissa's lack of choices, but even more than that it is a cry for help from an author who was plagued by her own fears and doubts.<br />As characters, the women are better realized than the men, and apart from the over-critical Peter and the intellectual light-weight Richard, most of the men are pretty unpleasant.  As such, women will probably enjoy this book more than men.  Casual readers be forewarned: the stream-of-consciousness technique makes for a very difficult read, particularly in the early pages, before we know who's who.  There's not a lot of plot; this book is primarily a character study of some fairly unhappy people.  For devotees of great literature, this novel is essential to understanding the author and the untold numbers of lost souls like her.  For everyone else, this is a very challenging novel about how we perceive others and ourselves, and not exactly a light entertainment.lack of choices, but even more than that it is a cry for help from an author who was plagued by her own fears and doubts.  <br />As characters, the women are better realized than the men, and apart from the over-critical Peter and the intellectual light-weight Richard, most of the men are pretty unpleasant.

A revolution in nanotechnology has prompted amazing developments, such as mass converters, surgical implants, and the Primer itself, which is an interactive combination of teaching tool and video game.  Living in a straight-laced Neo-Victorian culture, Equity Lord Finkle-McGraw commissions the unscrupulous programmer John Hackworth to create the Primer, which will help his young niece grow up to be a strong, independent woman, capable of someday being a leader.<br />The Primer is a very appealing concept, particularly in its more subversive aspects, as it teaches girls to rise above the prejudices of their cultural environment.  Hackworth, dissatisfied with his own lot, pirates a copy of the Primer for his beloved daughter, hoping that she can have a better life.  His plans go awry when he is mugged by a street gang, and the Primer ends up in the hands of Little Nell, a delightful, innocent tot who desperately needs to get out of her disintegrating home.  Can the Primer save Nell from a life of poverty and woe?<br />While less self-consciously hip than Stephenson's groundbreaking Snow Crash, this is another exquisite jewel of a book, despite some minor flaws.  The author once again demonstrates his mastery of dark humor in a tantalizing adventure that keeps you turning the pages.  Nell is eminently lovable, and even her brother Harv has his good points, so one can't help but root for the kids when we see the awful conditions they live in.  Sympathy for the plight of oppressed girls everywhere is a powerful theme in this book; one can't help but love the Mouse Army, comprised of cast-off victims of Asia's sexual discrimination.  As Nell grows up, it becomes clear that she, at least, will never be a second-class citizen.<br />There's a fair amount of action and plenty of suspense in this novel, but some readers will find the extreme length both daunting and unnecessary.  The section about the Drummers seems to contribute nothing to the story - it's just a bizarre idea that Stephenson wanted to include to spice things up a bit.  And the ending section where Nell labors through a long series of programming problems (without even allowing readers the opportunity to solve the puzzles themselves), seems to prolong the book needlessly.<br />This tome is a little much for younger readers, although it seems to be aimed at adolescent girls (and those who care about them).  Teenage boys may find themselves entranced by the brutal action of the opening scenes (focusing on Nell's father), but this pace doesn't continue, and they probably won't see the book through to the long fight sequence at the end.  Adult readers may find this book overlong, but the story is worth the effort.me length both daunting and unnecessary.

But how can he help the Spiders when he can't even help himself?<br />This book bears even less relationship to Vinge's Fire Upon the Deep than one might imagine, and really doesn't deserve to be called a prequel - they're two totally independent novels separated by thousands of years, that happen to share one major character, and even that character is really a pretty generic sci-fi hero. And since Pham Newem is the real star of this book, it's hard to see why so many pages are devoted to the hapless Ezr and his uncomfortable love triangle with Trixia and Qiwi, for example.  Even less pertinent are the seemingly interminable chapters about the Spiders, and one Spider family (does it even make sense for Spiders to have families?) in particular.<br />Although this is in many ways an excellent book, and certainly worth the effort for ardent sci-fi readers, one could hardly blame you if you found yourself skimming through some sections that don't seem to move things forward.  Younger readers in particular should steer clear, not so much because of a couple of inappropriate scenes (Vinge wants us to see what monsters the Emergents really are, and occasionally crosses the line) as because the plot's glacial slowness may be too much for their attention spans.<br />As with FUtD, there's a growing horror at work in this book as the helplessness of the Qeng Ho (read capitalist good guys) seems to reach a totality that smacks too much of melodrama.  It might actually have been better to break this ungainly tome up into a series of shorter novels, and try to work some hopeful note into the conclusion of each, without giving away the final resolution.<br />An excellent piece of sci-fi intrigue that could have been a little more tightly focused, but still ranks as top-notch escapism.top-notch escapism.	2003-09-19

Because he had actually made such a journey himself, Conrad is able to give ornate descriptions that bring this mysterious locale to life before our eyes - at least, for those whose response to the printed word is largely visual.  To those readers who, like this reviewer, are more intrigued by plot and character than by the appearance of a person or place, Conrad's lengthy descriptions of the river and its banks may seem tiresome, mere delay as the plot slowly unfolds.<br />And is it ever slow.  This measured pacing is supposed to create a strong element of suspense as we wonder what will happen when Marlow finally meets the mysterious Kurtz, but casual readers should be forgiven for not really caring.  The journey itself doesn't get exciting until the attack comes, a good three-quarters of the way through the book, so those hoping for action and adventure will find little to their taste.  So why is this novel considered such a masterpiece?<br />Apart from Conrad's turgid prose, the real power of this story is in its philosophical content.  Marlow's physical journey into Africa parallels a psychological journey into the darkness of the human condition.  He seeks a Kurtz who has been described as an emissary of science and progress, the best man the company has ever sent to Africa, a veritable superman whose humanity, sensitivity, leadership skills, and practical know-how have enabled him to accomplish amazing things in these most difficult of circumstances.  In effect Kurtz represents Colonialism itself; he is the living proof that European Imperialist policies can improve conditions in the colonies while netting a profit for the home country.  But what Marlow finds is something very different, and the equivocal conclusion forces the reader to make his own decisions about the moral choices that are made.  For many, the story makes a strong indictment of the atrocities perpetrated by Kurtz, and by extension, the colonial powers behind him, and by further extension, most of human history, which is characterized by the company manager as the process by which the strong take what they want from the weak, using brute force.<br />This is not a \\"fun\\" read; there's no trace of humor or romance as we use the term.  Women have only the tiniest roles, and there are passages that have been roundly criticized as offensive to Africans.  If those concerns don't bother you, and you can get past the slow plot, there are some heavy points being made here.  For the rest of us, Apocalypse Now is a fantastic film that sets pretty much the same story in war-era Viet Nam.  It won't get you through your English class, but it's a far more entertaining work of art.makes a strong indictment of the atrocities perpetrated by Kurtz, and by extension, the colonial powers behind him, and by further extension, most of human history, which is characterized by the company manager as the process by which the strong take what they want from the weak, using brute force.<br />This is not a \\"fun\\" read; there's no trace of humor or romance as we use the term.

While the plot is in many ways pretty ordinary - a boy who excels at his studies has a life-changing experience and is sent out into the world to find himself - there are plenty of unusual touches that take this fantasy beyond the run of the mill.<br />Severian's life in the Torturer's Guild is relatively mundane, and surely the writer's intention is to show that a boy's schooling is pretty much the same wherever he goes.  Although fate has decreed Severian will study the science of penance and punishment, his childhood is not really so very unusual.  He knows the same joys, terrors, and triumphs as the rest of us, so it's easy for us to find him sympathetic despite his (un-chosen) profession and frightening attire.  But outside the walls of the Citadel is a world that is rife with astounding wonders, from Dr. Talos' oddball repertory company to the bizarre doings in the Botanic Gardens to the most inventive dueling scene since Barry Lyndon.  And more often than not Severian finds himself both involved with a woman and required to ply his somewhat unsavory trade (not that this book is excessively gruesome; considering the title, it's really pretty tame, but still, this work is not recommended for young teens) before it's time to move on to the next town.<br />Wolfe's language helps create the other-worldly locale for his story, and he often employs archaic or invented words to describe objects that are common enough on \\"Urth\\", but are unfamiliar to us.  Almost every other page describes some incredible wonder.  And even though the practical-minded Severian frequently doesn't seem to react to the astounding things he sees and experiences, most readers will find themselves intrigued, even though the question \\"What does it all mean?\\" remains unresolved, at least for now.<br />All things considered, this book is pretty light fare: pure escapist fantasy, with no real point or depth of human insight, but it is a quick, enjoyable read and a promising opening to a highly acclaimed series.  The fictional narrator foreshadows great things in Severian's future, and presumably the succeeding books will reveal an overall plan and sense of purpose that this novel lacks in and of itself.olved, at least for now.<br />All things considered, this book is pretty light fare: pure escapist fantasy, with no real point or depth of human insight, but it is a quick, enjoyable read and a promising opening to a highly acclaimed series.

Our heroine teams up with another young doctor who has learned to simulate N.D.E.s in the laboratory.  The results of their experiments are certainly surprising enough, although they build up so slowly that you'll see it coming long before it hits.  In fact this book's biggest weakness is surely that things move far, far too slowly - almost in slow motion, one might say.  Coupled with the glacial plot is the wearisome repetition, particularly the running gags about the lunchroom, and evading Dr. Mandrake, and the difficulty finding one's way around the hospital.  Sure they're funny the first couple times, and these scenes do help to dramatize a valid point, but when all's said and done the novel runs hundreds of pages longer than it should have, and the repetition only exacerbates the reader's frustration.<br />Still, the plot line is so bizarre that one is irresistibly drawn into it.  Sure, we see what's happening, but how is Willis going to explain it?  In the final analysis, the explanation is perhaps a bit wanting, but more annoying is the way Willis drags the book on for another 150 pages or so even after the big d&eacute;nouement, trying to sneak in one more plot twist, which many readers will have seen through much, much earlier.<br />While not wishing to spoil any surprises, this book might well be recommended to buffs of major historical catastrophes.  For the rest of us, Willis would be well advised to write a short story version of this tale, so that fans of off-the-wall sci-fi/fantasy could appreciate the remarkably original idea she has come up with without spending two weeks poring over this too-often tedious tome.	2003-08-20

Blonde, slender, intelligent, and skilled at manipulating men, she frequents dive bars in Hawaii and San Francisco, attends college, and blames her parents because she isn't happier.  Perhaps the price she pays for her independence is that she never really cares about what happens to anybody else.  Has she ever thought about people who had it much, much worse than she?  You'd never know it from this book.<br />Fraser's memoir is most engrossing when she describes growing up in the free-form, no-rules, do-your-own-thing culture that flourished in California during the 60's and 70's.  Continually shuffled between her alcoholic father and man-crazed mother, she is deprived of the stability that she obviously desperately needs.  More than once, we get the premonition that something awful is going to happen to her, but unless this reviewer is failing to read between the lines, she never encounters anything worse than that which most adolescents deal with on a consistent basis.  The chapter on her experience teaching in the medium security prison provides a good example: we see the chance she is taking just by being there; trouble breaks out and she runs towards it rather than away, but in the end nothing bad actually happens to her.<br />More interesting might have been a book about her mother, who actually suffers from some of the problems that Fraser only references second-hand.  We are told that there were drunken orgies, a continual stream of men, substantial physical abuse, a number of failed marriages, a victory over alcoholism, and a developing interest in Native Americans, but usually the little girl in the background is sent off to her room, and doesn't really have much in the way of insights or information to share with us.  Another missed opportunity is the section on her cousin Karyn, who was murdered (by being stabbed forty-two times) by her boyfriend.  A little investigative reporting might have been in order here, because the bare facts we get don't really explain very much.  The lessons that Fraser draws from the story are significant enough, but one is reminded of a number of great writers who have done entire books about murders that were no more brutal than this one.<br />This is by no means a bad piece of writing, but it seldom manages to evoke the empty decadence of the times.  Most of the book is far more personal than historical, providing an overview of this young woman's relationship with her parents without betraying any really powerful emotions.  Doesn't she resent her parents for raising her like a circus animal?  Isn't she angry about the way they ship her back and forth, from one school to another, never letting her grow comfortable anywhere?  Some genuine emotion might lend pathos to a document that, viewed from the outside, isn't really that noteworthy.

Our hero is Dr. Lawler, a respected healer and voice of reason, whose tiny collection of Earth-made artifacts ties him to the dreams of a lost past on a distant home world.  Captain Delagard is the irrationally motivated merchant prince who uses his dreams of greatness to justify the most disreputable sort of means.  Tricked into a seemingly endless voyage to nowhere, the ragtag crew of human survivors faces terrible dangers before deciding if they want to maintain their essential humanity, or trade it in for the possibility of something far greater.<br />From a sci-fi perspective, the best part of this novel is the dazzling array of bizarre alien life forms, but most are just one-shot threats, and only the island-building Gillies are really developed to any extent.  There are long sections where Silverberg seems to be more interested in the psycho-social dynamics of the ship's crew than in the voyage itself, a tactic that only emphasizes how wooden and one-dimensional these characters are to begin with.  Our perspective being such that only the doctor is really important to us, none of the others are sufficiently realistic, complex, or engaging to sustain the kind of psychological thriller that Silverberg seems intent on creating.  So while this book is not a bad read, there are too many long stretches where the writer seems to be killing time before the next alien attack.  And after the long journey's end, the grand conclusion we were waiting for is based on one of the more tired clich&eacute;s in science fiction.  Silverberg's fans will surely enjoy this book, but given his prodigious output, casual readers would be better advised to pick one of his better novels over this substandard effort.  I personally suggest the beautiful and delicate Nightwings, or the monumental The World Inside.elicate Nightwings, or the monumental The World Inside.	2003-06-28

Although essentially an adventure story for boys, this classic novel has depth enough to entertain grown men as well.  The plot is effectively the logical opposite of London's classic \\"Call of the Wild\\", wherein a tame dog reverts into a wild animal.  In White Fang, the wolf/dog, born in the Wild, passes through a serious of owners (and adventures) and is eventually domesticated.  In the process, London implicitly renounces nihilism and affirms the power of love to save us all.<br />The feminine perspective is wholly absent from this book, so this will probably not be a favorite of young women, but boys of all ages should be enthralled by the harsh and exotic locale and engaged by the violent, remorseless power of natural selection at work in this story.  The unique point of view allows readers to see humanity (and the world) in very simplistic, cleanly judgmental terms - White Fang accepts no excuses and makes no apologies.  The fuzzy gray areas that we struggle with daily don't exist in his black and white world.  His instinctual drives and primitive emotions resonate with something inherent in all creatures, and ultimately, this book about socialization should help us learn a little more about how to tame the beast inside of us.<br />The novel is also worth re-examining from a post-colonial perspective.  London gives us the rare opportunity to see Native American culture (albeit from White Fang's restricted, but fairly objective viewpoint), and allows us to draw our own conclusions about Gray Beaver and his relationship with nature, with his tribe, and with the white man.  Certainly there are times when London allows his own prejudices to shine through, especially when Beauty Smith introduces Gray Beaver to alcohol, but for the most part, the white men who have come north seeking their fortunes come off considerably worse than their Native American hosts.  A philosophical tour-de-force.e off considerably worse than their Native American hosts.  A philosophical tour-de-force.	2003-06-18
US	49836087	R15OCIX0NNGITV	0452270073	779881568	Regeneration	Books	3	52	57	N	N	A fine philosophical novel, but not for the average reader	This first book in Barker's WWI trilogy is based on the real-life treatment of poet Siegfried Sassoon by psychiatrist and anthropologist Dr. William Rivers at Craiglockhart War Hospital.  Sassoon has publicly denounced the war as a \\"senseless slaughter\\" and refuses to fight anymore.  The powers that be assign him to Rivers' care as a victim of \\"shell shock\\" - a traumatic experience that leaves men unable to function.  The hospital's aim is not so much to cure as to return men to active duty - an objective that leaves Rivers conflicted as doctor and a humanitarian.<br />In an era when treatment of mental illnesses was often barbaric, (as in a memorable scene near the book's conclusion), Rivers' treatment plan is to cure with compassion and respect for the patient.  He allows these men the freedom to work through their experiences instead of repressing them.  In doing so, he takes some of their suffering onto himself, and is changed in the process.  The give and take between doctor and patient is the real meat of the story.<br />But beyond the plot, there's a lot to think about in this novel.  In fact, the real genius of this work is not the plot or the characters or the setting, but rather the seemingly endless array of serious ethical questions that crop up as these men struggle with their situations.  Was Britain justified in going to war against Germany?  Can war ever be moral?  Who is responsible for the actions of nations?  Do soldiers abdicate their moral responsibilities when they don the uniform?  How can a doctor cure a patient's infirmity only to send him back to the front lines to die?  How does this apply to conscientious objectors?  Is it enough to treat symptoms when the underlying causes are psychological?  Barker doesn't provide answers, but wants us to look for them in ourselves.<br />This would be a terrific book for teaching an ethical philosophy course, and surely that's why this novel is so highly praised by reviewers.  However, as an entertainment, this book is substantially less successful.  One patient's brief dalliance with a factory girl provides almost our only glimpse of a woman, and even this episode seems tacked on, and is decidedly unromantic.  And as one might expect, there is absolutely no trace of humor in this book at all - no one ever cracks a smile, let alone a joke.  Less predictably, there's very little action in this book, either.  The patients' tales of horrors at the front are powerful enough, but rarely run more than a page or two, and we don't get many of those.

On the other hand, the beautiful simplicity of Angelou's poetry will probably fail to appeal to kids who are experienced enough to expect a certain level of plot in their reading.<br />My advice to parents is this: don't give this book to your kids - buy it for yourselves, and keep it someplace where it won't get all trashed up by dirty little hands.  When you think they're ready, let your youngsters look at this book with you, so if the pictures should strike them the wrong way, you'll be there for them.  Better not do this at bedtime until you're sure how they'll react - this could be the stuff nightmares are made of.  But even if they love it, hang on to the book yourself, so that in a couple of years when your child loses interest (they may begin to see it as a \\"baby book\\"), you'll still have a beautiful coffee-table book of post-modernist art to share with your friends.  And eventually, your kids might grow up into little intellectuals who can see what a delightful creation this book really is.  It may not be perfect for anyone, but it certainly has something for everyone.ng for everyone.	2003-06-07

This book is the sequel to Arthur C. Clarke's landmark First Contact novel Rendezvous with Rama, that showed an intrepid team of Earthmen exploring an apparently abandoned alien spacecraft that passes through our system.  This is the second book in a series that will continue with The Gardens of Rama, and Rama Revealed.  This time around Clarke is writing with NASA scientist Gentry Lee, whose knowledge of space engineering adds some details that the first novel had missed.<br />The first half of the book is fairly interesting, showing how the beautiful, ambitious, unscrupulous newscaster Francesca Sabatini manipulates the decision-makers who are nominally in charge of the racially, religiously, and nationally diverse expedition.  Squared off against her is the heroine, Nicole des Jardins, the French-African Life Sciences Officer, who has secrets of her own.  Once underway, a deadly accident causes a shift in the expedition's power structure.  Then, once the remaining crew is aboard the Rama spacecraft, Clarke and Lee's scientific skills come to the fore, describing the peculiar features of this enormous vessel, and the seemingly inexplicable activities of the creatures (?) found within.<br />The second half functions as a more straightforward space adventure story, featuring Nicole des Jardins' perils aboard the Rama.  All the intrigue gets lost in the excitement of wondering how Nicole will escape her doom on Rama, and while the resolution may be satisfactory enough for some, perhaps, it does require a good stretch of the imagination.  Unfortunately, this book's ultimate conclusion really cuts the entire first half adrift, and the whole is less than satisfying.  Perhaps the next volume, The Gardens of Rama, will once again pick up the plot threads that are left dangling in Rama II.  One can hope so, at least, and the three-star rating reflects that expectation to a considerable extent, because without any further resolution this book would be very weak indeed.a II.

Disappointingly, this volume is anything but.  Apart from the hysterical introduction and the delightful eponymous section, most of this book is depressing, unfunny, and misogynistic.<br />The introduction is in the form of an Address to the National Federation of Associations Convention and discusses Keillor's associate with a men's club known as the Sons of Bernie (S.O.B.'s) - desperate losers indulging in a drunken orgy of song, story, and self-pity around their annual campfire.  Although basically as misogynistic as the rest of the book (as the title hints, misogyny is really the main theme), the piece struck this reviewer as genuinely funny, even evoking some outright belly-laughs.  It would seem that male readers over the age of 25 or so had a real treat in store.<br />This hope was quickly dashed.  \\"Lonesome Shorty\\" is the tale of a cowboy who gives up the life so he can pursue some of his more effete interests.  He finds a little place to settle down, and picks out a china pattern, after which things pretty much fall apart.  This is the first of twenty-odd stories about men whose lives were either ruined or at least needlessly complicated by women, and bizarre and senseless as it is, it's probably among the best of the lot, possibly because the very absurdity of it makes the story seem ironic.  Other pieces are not nearly so excusable.  \\"Buddy the Leper\\" makes no sense at all, while \\"Marooned\\" is plain hateful.<br />Only \\"Gary Keillor\\" achieves the kind of Wonder Years warmth that presumably characterized his radio show.  The tale focuses on Keillor's introduction to the entertainment business, as a sixteen year old giving a dramatic reading of Whitman's classic elegy on the death of Abraham Lincoln (\\"O Captain! my Captain!\\") for the school's spring talent show.  These 18 pages are good enough that they could be recommended as an enjoyable reminiscence.  The 20 page introduction will be amusing for men who have suffered some reversals in their lives, but still have a sense of humor about it, although women will surely find it less amusing.

For example, several of the main characters who took up so much space in Green Mars without actually contributing anything finally find significance in Blue Mars.  There are also strong continuities of plot and theme, especially in the way that the second half of Green flows into the first half of Blue.  While Green took forever to get going, Blue starts considerably stronger before fading into Robinsons now-familiar descriptions of Martian scenery that can be described as either breath-taking or interminable depending on your point of view.  In fact, the greatest weakness of Blue is that feeling that weve seen it all before.  After the thousand-odd pages that make up the first two volumes, readers might be hungry for some variety, a few surprise plot twists, a technical tour-de-force of some kind, but instead its pretty much business as usual on Mars, with the same (now aged) characters often grinding the same metaphorical axes.  The murder mystery and sexual tension that drove Red has completely dissipated, and Robinsons attempts along these lines in Blue seem spurious, if not downright silly.  Readers who loved Green as much as Red will surely find this book rewarding enough, but those who didnt feel Green was quite up to snuff wont find anything special in Blue.	2003-03-31

Visit Malgudi	A well-dressed but enigmatic stranger claiming to be from Timbuctoo takes advantage of a small-town journalist in this short novel set in the fictional town of Malgudi, India, that R. K. Narayan has brought to life in an entire series of books.  The journalist (and well-known busybody) is our narrator for the story of Dr. Rann, who is ostensibly preparing a report for the U.N. on futurology, although he seems to do little enough work.  Dr. Rann drifts into this quiet little backwater of a town and quickly makes himself at home, helping himself to what few amenities are available. Our journalist begins to feel somewhat taken advantage of, until the good doctors wife shows up.  But not to worry, things work out well enough in the end, (with some clever manipulation), and if any parties are less than thrilled with the outcome, at least no one is seriously worse off than they were before.<br />The brevity of this novel (116 pages) is such that Narayan addresses it himself in a postscript, but to say that this book is too short would be a mistake.  It struck this reviewer that by cropping the early and middle sections still further, one could have made a very creditable novella with this material without losing much.  As it is the middle section does seem to drag a bit.  The best feature of this book is Narayans delicate touch with characterization, sketching familiar types with just a few lines: the old librarian and his wife, their granddaughter Girija, the distraught station master, the old porter, Varma (who owns The Boardless Hotel), the Deputy Minister, and even the President of the Lotus Club.  The locale almost stands as a character itself, constantly intervening with its all-too-familiar small town inquisitiveness and morality, but still adding an exotic touch to the story.  While not a real thigh-slapper, Narayans upbeat tale is written in a pleasant, easy-to-read style that is as accessible to teens as adults.  Theres nothing really special going on here, but if youd like a quiet, relaxing vacation in South Asia but just cant get away, Malgudi may be just the place for you.oing on here, but if youd like a quiet, relaxing vacation in South Asia but just cant get away, Malgudi may be just the place for you.	2003-03-25

Eagleton's relationship to Marxism has gone through many permutations over the years, until the 1970's when he rejected the development of literary theory entirely in favor of a more functional ideal - bringing about social change.  He continues to teach literary theory, as well as English and Irish literature to this day, but this book shows the professor more interested in educating and entertaining his readers than in filling their heads with yet another abstruse theory, possibly operating under the principle that knowledge promotes better understanding.  This book covers a lot of Irish territory, including standard geographic data, frank discussion about some major figures from Irish history (both political and literary), and the major tourist attractions, but he presents everything in a way that is as succinct and delightful as it is informative.  In doing so, he debunks a lot of the common misconceptions about Ireland, while still managing to offend just about everyone.  (How many Irish mothers does it take to change a light bulb?  None, I'll just sit here in the dark...)<br />Irony has always been one of Eagleton's preferred tools, and he is most effective when turning it towards the Irish's undeserved international reputation for hard drinking, fighting, and blarney.  Eagleton always tries to be even-handed, even when discussing such dangerous topics as The Troubles and Environmentalism; and on the whole, he is successful, coming across as a likable, convivial guide to one of Europe's least understood countries.  The encyclopedia format allows readers the convenience of looking up any items of particular interest, while skipping over topics that don't appeal to you.  Recommended for those who want to know more about Ireland, and would rather risk being offended for the sake of entertainment than pore over a dry, scholarly treatment of the subject.	2003-03-15

As he did so effectively in Farmer in the Sky, Citizen of the Galaxy, and Starman Jones, Heinlein uses his protagonist's education as a means of describing the structure and ideas behind what is in this instance a highly militaristic utopia.  There's plenty of action for those who are fans of such, starting with a raid against the humanoid \\"Skinnies,\\" and ending with a battle against the arachnoid \\"Bugs.\\"  In between we get a very detailed and personal account of Johnnie's training, both mental and physical, including plenty of the kind of philosophizing that Heinlein later became notorious for.  If it's any consolation, the philosophy is at least very much to the point, since it helps us understand the political and Darwinian principles on which this distinctly militaristic culture is built.<br />And of course, there's nobody in science fiction who can match Heinlein on matters military.  The battle suits sound like a great idea; each soldier would be the equivalent of an armored tank, although one wonders how cost effective such equipment would be.  The battle scenes are also first-rate and thoroughly believable (at least insofar as any battle with aliens can be).  But best is Johnnie's training, which has a veracity that can only come from a writer who has a clear vision of not only what Mobile Infantry training would be like, and how it would differ from contemporary military training, but understands the whys and wherefores of both.  Heinlein envisions a world where everyone has the right to serve his/her country, (yes, women, too), but only by doing so can one earn the right to vote.  He maintains that only those who prove their willingness to die for their country can be trusted to make decisions for it.  This is one of the very first books where Heinlein really gets on his soapbox and tells his readers how the world should be run and why.  Regardless of how one views this philosophy, it makes a powerful statement that makes this book far superior to the earlier (and puerile) Space Cadet, which deals with similar material.<br />Philosophy aside, the book is not without some problems.  Heinlein's solution to the \\"characterization problem\\" is to have the same few people pop up again and again \\"by coincidence,\\" giving the novel a more unified, family feel, but not without stretching credulity to the breaking point.  And as usual, Heinlein is far more interested in making his case convincingly than he is in balance or complexity or even opposing viewpoints.  If you disagree with him, you're wrong, and since he's writing the story, his results always bear him out.  Young people who read this book and find themselves strongly swayed by Heinlein's rhetoric should remember that lots of things work better in theory than they do in actual practice, so please don't try this at home, kids.  But for those interested in political or military philosophy, this is a must read.e Heinlein really gets on his soapbox and tells his readers how the world should be run and why.

Although she is pleased to have him as a friend, she is not attracted to him romantically, and instead falls head over heels for Miu, a sophisticated older woman with a mysterious secret in her past that prevents her from consummating this, or any relationship.  That doesn't stop Sumire from going to work for Miu as a personal secretary, or from embarking with her on an extended business trip through Europe, but it does keep Sumire too busy to keep up with her old friend, or continue the writing that once meant so much to her.  Our hero listlessly tries to get on with his life, until he receives word that Sumire is missing - vanished without a trace from a small island in Greece.<br />Unfortunately, about halfway through the novel, we become aware that the rules of reality have shifted on us, and we're suddenly in a world where anything's possible - a change that sadly undercuts the fairly prosaic, modern-day love story that we thought we were reading.  After reading about frigidity, platonic love, and lesbianism, we're suddenly dealing with doppelgangers and alternate universes.  Perhaps Murakami is trying to study the nature of life-changing experiences, but by making his examples so other-worldly, this reviewer finds it difficult to empathize with characters whose problems are so plainly impossible.  To put it another way, if a good friend of yours had a near-death experience in a car crash, or on the operating table, you would likely be far more sympathetic than if he told you he'd been abducted by aliens from another planet.  Instead, you'd be sorely tempted to assume he was off his nut, and if he didn't get over it, you'd probably find yourself distancing yourself from him, and that's basically what happened to this reviewer and this book.  The temptation is very strong to say, \\"Come off it.  Nobody's going to believe that, so either tell us what really happened or else forget the whole thing\\".<br />Murakami is clearly a talented writer, but this book doesn't know what it's doing and never goes anywhere.  Surely no one will buy this book as science fiction or horror - 95% of the story is as everyday as Capote's Breakfast at Tiffany's.  But the outlandish scenes totally upstage the rest of the story, effectively rendering the rest of the book irrelevant.  Perhaps Murakami had a short novel about a lesbian romance and didn't know how to end it, so he took a story fragment about an out-of-body experience and used that for his Second Act, after which the story stumbles aimlessly along for another 50 tedious pages before fizzling out altogether.  In any case, the resultant hybrid simply isn't fair to the reader, who enters the novel in good faith expecting a real world resolution, and instead finds no resolution at all..

Despite the obvious co-operation of the artist and his friends (who were interviewed for the project) Carr never really seems to get inside the head of this brilliant, but still enigmatic musician.  Instead, the reader is left with dozens of nagging questions, some of which, admittedly, are so personal as to be none of anyones business, but which the typical gossip-monger (who inevitably makes up a substantial percentage of the biography-reading public) will feel cheated by the conspicuous absence of.<br />Recreational drugs, for example, dont even exist as far as this book is concerned, which is understandable for Christian Scientist Jarrett, but doesnt seem too likely so far as the rest of the jazz world goes.  We get none of the typical rock star road stories from his days at the top with Charles Lloyd or Miles Davis, although its hard to believe he saw no wild excesses in the music business during the late sixties.  Nor does Jarrett seem to have been much of a womanizer, which is certainly to his credit of course, but anyone hoping for explicit details about wild orgies with groupies will be disappointed.  Serious musicians might have at least appreciated transcriptions of some of Jarrett's more famous pieces, but he scotched that idea too.<br />Of course Carr can only work with the facts hes given, but some other questions are never satisfactorily dealt with: What drove this poverty-stricken young Allentown native into so poor-paying a field as jazz?  Whats the real story behind his reputation as a difficult man to work with?  And why does this brilliant pianist and captivating improviser so often pursue projects which undercut his own strengths, playing soprano sax, or recording volumes of standards and classical music?<br />Instead of answers, what we get is Carrs copious reviews of several of Jarretts major albums (although many others are ignored altogether and are only mentioned in the Discography  perhaps the highlight of the book, even though the songs are listed without the names of the composers).  The 200 page chronology of Jarretts life splits after the Sun Bear set, so that his most inventive and commercially successful period falls within the first hundred pages.  After this the book really drags, perhaps most especially for those (dare one suggest the majority?) who arent really quite as excited by his later forays into jazz standards and classical performances.<br />Carr is most effective in communicating the musical philosophy of this dedicated artist, who creates music by achieving a kind of transcendent emotional consciousness.

The book is structured as a series of self-sufficient vignettes, detailing separate incidents in the everyday lives of these very everyday people in the early 20th century.  The father,  Morris Stroup, is lazy, thoughtless, possibly a womanizer (only the Grass Widow knows for sure), certainly a thief, frequently a drunk, and willing to turn his hand to anything except honest work.  The mother, Martha, is appropriately harried, cantankerous, demanding, and dictatorial.  She takes in wash to help make ends meet, but she bitterly resents the fact that she has to do so much hard work (that she considers beneath her) just to make up for her husband's shortcomings.  So what's a boy to do, but just try to stay out of the way?<br />The stories are told from the viewpoint of young William, but he is rarely more than an observer.  Handsome Brown, the `Negro yardboy', gets stuck doing the really dirty work, and gets pretty short shrift from both grownups, although he and William are great pals.  He bears the brunt of most of the book's physical humor, and some enterprising student could probably write a good paper about racism (or just plain southern stereotypes) using this book.  Despite the nostalgic, Wonder Years viewpoint, there's an undercurrent of pain and frustration  that makes us sympathize with these characters even when we see them behaving pretty badly, as when Pa comes home drunk and starts breaking the furniture, or Ma's endlessly distressing over what the neighbors will think.  Caldwell's picturesque prose paints some hilarious pictures - the goats on the roof, and the attack of the shirt-tail woodpeckers stick in the mind - but the actual belly-laughs are few and far between, and too often the characters come off as more pathetic than lovable.  As a result, the pleasure one might derive from these slapstick antics is tempered by the misery and poverty that these luckless people seem doomed to live in.  Fans of southern literature will find this book fairly light reading, however, since many American authors (Faulkner, Twain, Harper Lee, etc...) have dealt with the foibles, follies, pain and pathos of these kinds of characters far more effectively.the pleasure one might derive from these slapstick antics is tempered by the misery and poverty that these luckless people seem doomed to live in.

Unfortunate, that, because in this world of the not-too-distant future musicals are dead, as is most live-action film-shooting.  The hot properties in the movies are the images of stars long-dead - Marilyn Monroe, Carole Lombard, River Phoenix, and James Dean, and every new film is a remake.  Tom is a freelance movie editor whose primary occupation is fitting classic films with the images of the studio boss's latest girlfriend.  This sad fact galls him to no end, since unlike most of the beautiful young people on the make in Hollywood, Tom actually watches movies, and hates to see the classics butchered by the soulless, self-serving, drug-numbed, money-hungry executives who run the studios.  Fascinated by Alis and her impossible dream, Tom tries to help her as best he can and gives readers a sardonic overview of how movies will be made in the future in the process, but Alis proves resourceful enough all by herself, and manages to achieve her dream in a way that no one could possibly have imagined.<br />The novel is structured something like a treatment for a movie script (possibly a hypermodern, science fiction remake of Casablanca), and the first-person narrator shows his obsession with old movies by constantly referencing classics by Monroe, Humphrey Bogart, and Alis's favorite dancer, Fred Astaire.  This is not another tightly knitted time travel story along the lines of Willis's irresistible To Say Nothing of the Dog.  The sci-fi/fantasy aspects of the story are extremely hard to follow and may ultimately prove disappointing to fans of such, and the humor tends to fall flat more often than not.  But at the same time, the love story (which is really the unifying force here) is so infused with dance scenes, movie references, and techno-jargon that no one could confuse this book for a romance novel.<br />If you love the old movie musicals, and Fred Astaire in particular, this book should be an unending delight.  There are so many references to characters, scenes, and dance numbers from the movies of the mid-Twentieth Century that a true aficionado could spend years checking them all out on video.  If on the other hand your knowledge of such films is virtually nil and you couldn't care less, you may feel that this book has nothing special to offer.ld be an unending delight.

Oh, yes, well maybe it is.  No.  No, it definitely isn't.  These were this reviewer's reactions while reading this sometimes too prosaic novel by science fiction legend Philip K. Dick.  Set in the late 1950's, the story focuses on Jim Briskin, a DJ at San Francisco's KOIF radio station, his ex-wife Pat, and an impoverished young couple, fans of his program, whom he befriends.  He finds these young people strangely alien in attitude and beliefs, and strange they are indeed.  Art is a shy, stammering young man with zero social skills.  He works as a helper at a used car lot, but doesn't seem too concerned that  Rachael is expecting their first child, and when she stops working they'll lose two-thirds of their income.  Rachael herself has a strangely stoic quality, and while her social skills are also limited, she has a unique self-confidence based on the knowledge that she's always right.  Sci-fi buffs will surely expect a denouement in which this couple is revealed to be from some faraway planet, but the truth of the matter is that they are not so much from another world as simply from another generation, yet are still just as distant from Jim and his world as if they really were aliens.  The plot thickens when Art leaves his pregnant wife to pursue a torrid affair with Pat, but it quickly becomes apparent who among these all-too-familiar characters really needs help.<br />If subverting reader expectations were a goal in itself, this would surely be a very successful novel.  This reviewer felt almost as though Dick was playing a joke on his readers by setting them up to expect first one standard science fiction twist (mind control), and then another (alien invaders), but never delivering on any of them, and instead leaving us (in the end) with a fairly common tale of marital infidelity and emotional loss.  More likely this book is just an example of a genre writer trying to stretch out and try something different, even (dare we say it?) something serious.  Dick may be trying to define a generational sea change that was taking place in America, with young people growing up oblivious to the hang-ups (and value structures) that controlled the lives of their elders.  But while this novel has a few interesting features, some of which lie within the province of science fiction (i.e., the remote control car, and the bubble), they aren't nearly enough to carry the book as a whole. In fact they might actually put off those (few) readers who would otherwise be likely to appreciate this book as a novel of mid-20th Century manners, or whatever.  In any case, whether it's because it tries to be too many things at once, or because the disparate elements never really gel, this book fails to do more than occasionally entertain, and much of it's pretty depressing at that.even (dare we say it?) something serious.

US	49836087	R3I8CIB4OL1ECX	059043053X	561513034	Around The World In Eighty Days	Books	3	8	11	N	N	19th Century Adventure is too tame for today's readers	Among the most realistic of Verne's \\"imaginary voyages\\", this novel describes how Phileas Fogg, a reclusive, eccentric,  British bachelor, wagers some members of his club that he can travel completely around the globe in just eighty days, based on rail and steamer schedules available to this very punctual man.  So off he goes, on what should have been a fun-filled, adventure-packed journey.  Unfortunately, this precursor to the science fiction novel has not held up well over the years, and it's really a testimony to the ever-changing world that we live in that this was ever considered an adventure novel.  Too often the action takes place \\"out of scene\\" and is only described after the fact, losing the story's intensity and immediacy.  The characters are quite one-dimensional; Passepartout, the faithful French manservant, provides only the barest minimum of comic relief, and Aouda, the love interest, isn't much more successful.  The real stars should have been the different cultures and modes of transport experienced by the travelers, but even these are often treated in a cursory fashion.  Instead, the focus is on timetables and detours and the hapless Detective Fix, who believes that Fogg is wanted for robbery.<br />It seems as though Verne had a clever idea for a short story (that is, he had the conclusion, or \\"hook\\", for a puzzle-type story), but needing a round-the-world tour to make it work, found himself writing a novel that he really had relatively little interest in.  As a result, the story doesn't really heat up until the very end, and even there the final twist will not manage to surprise many contemporary readers.  A very light entertainment, but no longer very impressive or imaginative in a world where astronauts orbit the globe in hours.  This story might have seemed remarkable to those born before the days when commercial aviation made the world such a small place, but younger readers will probably find this book far too tame to suit their tastes.	2002-11-19
US	49836087	R2Z63DL3LOVCLY	0553269828	224417303	Sundiver (The Uplift Saga, Book 1)	Books	3	9	9	N	N	A confused, modest opening to the Uplift Saga	Brin's first novel is notable for introducing the Uplift - a concept so far-reaching and yet almost believable (by sci-fi standards) that it spawned an entire series of books.  The basic idea is that a scientifically advanced race will eventually learn enough about genomes to be able to \\"Uplift\\" other species to much higher levels of intelligence.  In the future, dolphins and chimpanzees will become man's friends and apprentices.  Meanwhile, the same process occurs on other planets, many of which have their own family of `client' species, leaving the galaxy filled with scads of sentient alien races.  Against this backdrop, the story focuses on some scientific discoveries related to sundiving, and these drive the main plot of this somewhat confused novel.  Indeed, the biggest weakness of this sprawling book is not a shortage of interesting ideas, but their overabundance, and a resultant lack of focus.  Amidst so many alien species, each with their own secret political agendas, the reader doesn't get a very fair chance to solve the mystery that's presented.<br />Jacob Dimwa is a renowned hero who once saved the 20-mile-high Vanilla Needle tower from disaster in Ecuador, but was unable to save his beloved wife Tania.  Still haunted by the incident, he nurtures an alternate personality that shows up under duress.  Now a dolphin specialist, he helps dolphins realize their full intellectual potential (pretty high).  He is brought to the Sundiver base on Mercury to help investigate the two unique life forms that have been found living in the sun itself.  There's a societal subtext of Citizens versus Probationers (persons with a known tendency towards violence are not allowed near aliens), and the mystery behind Dr. Kepler's medication and illness may be just another red herring.  Also, Dr. Martine is having secret discussions with Bubbacub, but are they the real villains here, or is there something even more nefarious at work?  And when Jeffrey's ship crashes, was it an accident?  Or was it destroyed by external forces protecting their own existence?  Or was the ship sabotaged to further someone's political agenda?  Dimwa will need all his personalities to find out.<br />Nothing is as it appears to be in this story, and Brin seems to have gone overboard making sure no one would guess the secrets too early in this surprising mystery.  Instead, this reader found that even after the denouement, it was difficult to keep track of who had been responsible for what.  So as a mystery, this novel doesn't really play very fair.  As science fiction, there are a lot of good ideas here, and Brin does a decent job of giving everyone a unique characterization, particularly all the various aliens.  In the last analysis, the problem is the protagonist Dimwa.  With the point of view trained on his split personality and tormented past and near-suicide and fear of insanity, we really don't get to have much fun investigating all these outrageous scientific discoveries.  The novel seems weighed down by a pall of doom that prevented this reader from enjoying it as much as it the ideas in it deserved.  Cut some of the `downers' that don't advance the plot anyway, and you'd have a much better book.  Nonetheless, many will wish to read this introduction to the highly acclaimed Uplift Saga.  Just don't expect a masterpiece.ccident?  Or was it destroyed by external forces protecting their own existence?  Or was the ship sabotaged to further someone's political agenda?

In a manner that is typical of Oriental art, the story is exquisitely simple and understated - too understated for Western tastes, perhaps.<br />Etsuko is a mother who left Nagasaki not long after the war, and settled in England.  Of her two daughters, one, Niki, is only half Japanese, and now, years later, goes to school in London.  A very modern and thoroughly Westernized woman, she is not interested in having children, or even a husband, and has still less interest in the Japanese traditions that her mother grew up with.  The other daughter, Keiko, a full-bred Japanese, has committed suicide some years earlier.  In a way that is at once very confusing and very revealing, the book switches back and forth between the present, when Niki comes home for a visit, and Etsuko's memories of another mother, Mariko, and her damaged daughter, whom she briefly knew in Nagasaki.<br />Even more so than in the excellent Remains of the Day, the story and characters in this book work better as allegory than they do as portraits of reality.  Ogata, Etsuko's father-in-law, represents the old guard whose belief in Japanese tradition is so strong that even the cataclysm of WWII has not shaken it.  Niki is the younger generation - the new Japan - only half Japanese actually, who has repudiated her Japanese roots altogether.  Meanwhile Keiko, the future of the Old Japan, has destroyed herself.  In between we have the two mothers, Etsuko and Mariko.  Mariko repeatedly expresses her unbounded confidence in others: in her uncle, in her American \\"friend\\", and in her daughter's mental state.  Nothing is a problem to her; all setbacks are only temporary, she'll be fine, thank you very much anyway.<br />Many of the characters repeat the same phrases over and over as though the magnitude of the disaster has left them unable to move forward.  For example, Etsuko's father-in-law, a retired school teacher very attached to the old ways, has been publicly insulted and keeps asking his son to do something about it.  His son keeps complaining how busy and tired he is.  The mother Mariko and her daughter are two more broken records.  With all this repetition, there's no real character development, and blessed little plot.  Instead, the book is like a certain style of Japanese painting, with one or two broad, bold dark strokes surrounded by a handful of delicate details.  As one continues to stare at the painting, one appreciates its harmony, its simplicity, its unity.  Another good metaphor for this novel is the onion; although we never get past the first couple of layers, we can see that there's a lot inside.  And of course you can't peel those layers without a few tears.<br />This is a beautifully written story with a quiet intensity about it that defies easy analysis.  The reader keeps waiting for something \\"big\\" to happen, but of course the calamity that struck before the book's opening overpowers everything else in it.  The sadness that pervades the whole novel is so overwhelming that it leaves this reviewer disinclined to recommend the book despite its many wonderful qualities.  It seems likely that Ishiguro wrote this book as a sort of therapy; the pain and anguish and horror and sense of loss and hopelessness must have stayed with the survivors of Nagasaki for the rest of their lives (as it does for the families of suicides), yet somehow they found the strength to go on anyway.  If there's any real upside to this novel, it's that time heals all wounds, and life goes on no matter how bad things might get, but that optimistic message is limited to the last couple of pages.  Fine as this book is, it's recommended only for literary scholars, and for those readers who don't already have enough sadness in their lives.a retired school teacher very attached to the old ways, has been publicly insulted and keeps asking his son to do something about it.

Ready to leave the rat race behind and head off to a virgin territory where a man can be a man and live off the land in peace?  Science fiction grandmaster Robert Heinlein points to the new frontier and invites those of us who've really got the guts to leave our comfortable planet, to become Farmers in the Sky.<br />Amoung the best of Heinlein's juveniles, this fascinating novel tells the story of young Bill Lermer, whose family chooses to leave an increasingly overcrowded earth for the ostensibly greener pastures of a growing colony on Ganymede, the largest moon of Jupiter.  Through Bill's eyes, readers get to see the selection process, the thoughtful preparations, the wearying journey, the chaotic arrival, and finally settlement in a new home on a new world.  And then things really get exciting...<br />This book was originally serialized in \\"Boy's Life\\", the Boy Scouts of America magazine, which is why scouting finds its way into each chapter, but Heinlein makes excellent use of the concept, not only in terms of character building (which is an essential feature of this coming-of-age novel), but also as an important part of a practical education.  While Bill studies for his merit badges, the reader gets to look over his shoulder and learn everything a greenhorn needs to know to survive on this untamed world, from physics to ecology.  Best of all, Heinlein makes his explanations seem so reasonable that one almost wonders why we aren't out there building colonies right this minute.<br />But despite his gung ho pioneer spirit, Heinlein isn't a Pollyanna - he isn't trying to hide the more unpleasant facts of colonial life.  During the selection process and the long voyage out, Bill has ample time to observe the uglier side of human nature.  At the new colony, danger is part of everyday life, and there are deaths aplenty before the story is over.  The adventure with the survey expedition is a little over the top, but the philosophic discussion about the future of the human race more than makes up for it.  And the characters are superb - Hank, the risk-taker, Captain Hattie, the gruff pilot, the unflappable Schultzes, Bill's father, but most of all Bill himself, whose honesty, determination, and naivet&eacute; combine to make him one of the most believable (but still lovable) characters in all of Heinlein.<br />This book has everything a kid could want in a science fiction novel - carefully thought-out science, a thoroughly believable space journey, a revealing look at everyday life in a developing but managed ecology, settling a brave new world, mysterious alien artifacts, and one of the most engaging and personable characters ever to appear in science fiction.  Adults should enjoy this book as well, although there's no hint of sex and women get pretty short shrift here.  But all scouts (and would-be pioneers) are guaranteed to love it.he philosophic discussion about the future of the human race more than makes up for it.

Halberdier Guy Crouchback returns from Africa chastened, but still anxious to serve his country in its time of need.  Dismissed from his regiment due to his complicity in the death of his friend Apthorpe, Guy is now assigned to a Commando unit.  As part of a patchwork group called Hookforce, X Commando reaches the island of Crete just in time to cover the retreat and embarkation of the regular Allied forces, and are left with orders to surrender to the enemy after the other groups have left.<br />Once again, Waugh points his dry English wit at the freshly-commissioned British officers of WWII to amusing effect, while still making serious points about the readiness of British forces and the military suitability of Britain's gentry.  For example, one running gag is an officer frantically rushing to headquarters only to find that the commander doesn't know what to do with him.  The comedic high point is when Trimmer (a former hairdresser) is sent on a largely pointless mission by officers who are desperate to score a success - any success - in order to improve public perceptions of their unit.  Operation Popgun goes awry when the sub gets lost and accidentally stumbles into enemy territory, and when a sergeant, acting without orders, blows up a supply train, a clever reporter manages to describe the mission as a dramatic success, rather than the comedy of errors that it actually was.<br />More serious are the concluding sections that describe various characters' arduous withdrawal from Crete.  While there may be some black humor in these scenes, they seem to played more for dramatic effect, to show how men react to such harrowing situations.  Although Major Hound, Guy, and Ivor Claire each make different choices, one can scarcely say that one was really better than the other.<br />Readers who enjoyed Men at Arms will find this volume rather darker, with less emphasis on hijinks and more on military action.  Men at Arms really should be read first, however, because this volume assumes a certain familiarity with Crouchback's personality and military record, as well as some of the minor characters who are referred to frequently.

Zoyd is an aging California hippie, heavily into drugs, rock and roll, and easy living.  He lives on a government subsidy (disability) that provides for the simple needs of himself and his daughter, Prairie.  His ex-wife Frenesi, the daughter of two old-time Wobblies, takes the leftist movement very seriously until she falls for the fascist federal prosecutor Brock Vond.  Despite the story's initial focus on Zoyd, most of the book is devoted to Prairie trying to understand her mother.  She is helped in this quest by a butt-kicking ninja babe called D.L. who through press releases, personal interviews, and a series of politically charged home movies, reveals the truth about Frenesi.<br />As is typical, Pynchon's novel is more effective on a symbolic level than on a literal one.  Just as V investigated the dichotomy between the human and the inanimate, Vineland (the name of a city, perhaps similar to \\"Holly\\" \\"wood\\") explores the relationship between the sixties counterculture movement and leftist political philosophy.  Those who view this book as a leftist manifesto have perhaps overlooked the fact that it is Zoyd, the hippie, who is most sympathetic to the reader (and his daughter as well), while Frenesi (the true political leftist) who comes off as a driven, destructive witch.  At some level Frenesi's lust for Vond symbolizes her hunger for the power he represents.  Her lust for power drives her to sell out her ideals, just as the sixties leftists sold out theirs once the possibility of achieving real power came within their grasp.  Thus the difference between the hippies and the leftists was that the hippies wanted freedom, while leftists wanted control, and as such had more in common with the fascist right than with the counterculture that they manipulated.  Viewed in this light, Pynchon's message is not that leftist politics is better than fascism, but rather that both forms of political extremism are fundamentally flawed.  The book's hero is Zoyd, who is politically paranoid and legally insane (by government standards), so we see that Pynchon's political solution is merely to live one's own life, and maintain a deep distrust of anyone who encroaches on our freedoms whether from the left or the right.  And the heroine is not Frenesi, but D. L., who also takes care of Prairie at a crucial moment, and who uses her feminine power to deal with injustices one at a time, rather than trying to change the world.<br />Despite the metaphorical richness of this book, however, it suffers from some serious problems.  The science-fictiony presence of the so-called Thanatoids (ghosts of the unjustly dead) really adds nothing to the story, and along with the occasional reference to high-tech snooping devices, mid-air abductions, and strong female characters, seems a cheap ploy to draw in the cyberpunk audience without the necessity of actually studying science first.  But worse than any of that is the depressing world-view that pervades the entire book.  Frenesi's betrayals cast a pall over the entire novel, destroying everything in her path, and most of the novel simply follows her downward spiral into depravity and insignificance.  Pynchon is a fine writer and has created some amusing characters and situations here, but the bleakness of his political message undercuts the fun of the novel, leaving the reader, like Zoyd, happy to have someplace else to go home to.  This is in a many ways a brilliant book, but it's too X-files wacky for serious political readers, too unscientific for cyberpunks, and too dark for good escapism.  If none of these bother you, perhaps you'll really love it.rather that both forms of political extremism are fundamentally flawed.

L., who also takes care of Prairie at a crucial moment, and who uses her feminine power to deal with injustices one at a time, rather than trying to change the world.<br />Despite the metaphorical richness of this book, however, it suffers from some serious problems.  The science-fictiony presence of the so-called Thanatoids (ghosts of the unjustly dead) really adds nothing to the story, and along with the occasional reference to high-tech snooping devices, mid-air abductions, and strong female characters, seems a cheap ploy to draw in the cyberpunk audience without the necessity of actually studying science first.  But worse than any of that is the depressing world-view that pervades the entire book.  Frenesi's betrayals cast a pall over the entire novel, destroying everything in her path, and most of the novel simply follows her downward spiral into depravity and insignificance.  Pynchon is a fine writer and has created some amusing characters and situations here, but the bleakness of his political message undercuts the fun of the novel, leaving the reader, like Zoyd, happy to have someplace else to go home to.  This is in a many ways a brilliant book, but it's too X-files wacky for serious political readers, too unscientific for cyberpunks, and too dark for good escapism.  If none of these bother you, perhaps you'll really love it.	2002-09-21

Avoiding some of the obvious pitfalls, he began to write stories that contain elements of both of these popular genres.  But of the various stories in this collection, only Larry Niven's \\"ARM\\" really lives up to the title, combining the imagination of science fiction with the action and drama of a detective story.  Asimov's \\"The Singing Bell\\" comes close, and shows off the master's skill with \\"puzzle\\" stories, but the armchair detective doesn't really lend itself to exciting reading and would be a serious disappointment to fans who expect some action.  As for the rest, only Poul Anderson's \\"The Martian Crown Jewels\\" and \\"Time Exposures\\" by Wilson Tucker are bona fide sci-fi detective stories, and both are eminently forgettable.  Donald Westlake's \\"The Winner\\", Robert Silverberg's \\"Getting Across\\", and Philip K. Dick's \\"War Games\\" are all very good science fiction stories, indeed are the highlights of the collection, but there are no detectives in them.  Perhaps the most memorable sci-fi detective is Philip Jose Farmer's Herr Ralph Von Wau Wau, the intelligent canine of \\"A Scarletin Study\\", a humorous send up of the whole cross-genre concept.  In sum, while perhaps the blame lies more with the form than with the editing, this book fails to deliver what it promises; the overall collection isn't that strong as \\"just\\" science fiction, and the advertised combination of sci-fi and private detective fiction never really coalesces.  Readers interested in this idea would do better to pick up one of Asimov's many fine collections.	2002-09-21

One summer in Venice during the Civil War period two American tourists - a Mrs. Vervain and her beautiful daughter Florida - turn to these two men for help and change their lives forever.  Don Ippolito, despite his vow of celibacy, believes he is falling in love with Florida, while Ferris, all diplomacy and artistic sensibilities, finds her haughty and ill-mannered.  But more than the love story, Howells seems interested in exploring the uneasy relationship between these two very different men.  And the way things end up, is of course, a foregone conclusion.<br />Howells, one of the primary proponents of American Realism, presents us with a story that can nevertheless be viewed on many levels: as psychology, as religion, as art - the book hints at the whole world of human feeling.  So why does Howells choose to tell this story of a Venetian priest who tinkers with mechanical gadgets, and an American consul who fancies himself a painter?  A geo-political reading would suggest that the competition for the beautiful Florida symbolizes the struggle between the old and the new - certainly a relevant issue for post-Civil War Americans.  Perhaps even more to the point, Howells may be using these characters to represent contrasting literary styles, where the priest is the dreamy romantic and the artist is the practical realist.  However one chooses to interpret it, this is an entrancing story about two men at the crossroads of their lives, with exquisite prose, and some subtle moral lessons that make it well worth reading.<br />Of course there are some of the problems common with 19th Century fiction: the point of view makes it difficult to see the women as more than caricatures, there's absolutely no humor, and virtually no action.  So if reading about the feelings and conversations of a man from a bygone era doesn't interest you, you might want to look elsewhere.nt to look elsewhere.	2002-09-18

This book is much tighter and faster-moving than Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash, although not nearly as funny, and the virtual universe, while perhaps first conceptualized here, is not so painstakingly well-defined, but the elaborate mystery-and-caper plot still packs a powerful punch that makes this book worth re-reading.  There's plenty of action, tension,...and far-out sci-fi extrapolation, but in the long run, it's those quirky characters who bring the story to life.  Revolutionary at the time, they're now pretty much stock characters for the whole subgenre.  Case is the permanently out of work web jockey who wholly immersed himself in the rarified air of cyberspace until he made the mistake of trying to cross the wrong people.  After destroying his ability to enter the metaverse, Case becomes the typical dropout from straight society, living on the fringes, and daring the world to finish him altogether.  A reluctant hero, Case is ready to do whatever needs to be done when a mysterious stranger offers him the chance to return to the virtual world he's been ousted from.  His teammate Molly, rather than being the helpless baggage that clutters so many novels in the name of femininity, is instead the team's muscle - a tough-minded, hard-bodied mercenary who uses her womanly wiles as just another weapon.  Leading the team is the inscrutable Armitage, a combat veteran whose hopelessly mangled remains have been reassembled with the help of radical technology - but is he really the one calling the shots?  And how far can Case and Molly really trust him?  A quick-reading thriller that is not to be missed.	2002-09-05

Johanna and Jefri Olsndot each find themselves alone on a medieval world populated by pack-minded, dog-like beings, where life is cheap and the key to power lies in undermining the opposition.  Jefri's desperate calls for help are answered by Ravna and Phem (a long dead spacefarer who was re-animated by one of the seemingly god-like Powers), who with two alien Skroderiders (half slug, half machine) flee the Blight's destruction to try and save Jefri and the galaxy.<br />With a wondrous variety of really different alien beings, and a unique cosmology that is itself a significant part of the story, this is one of the most imaginative sci-fi novels in decades.  Suspenseful, but packed with action as well, the threads of the various subplots keep readers attention even as the main overall plot seems to hang suspended for much of the book.  Who will betray whom, among the complex sets of forces all seemingly at odds with each other?<br /><br />Still, there are some weaknesses, perhaps the most serious of which is the stupefying pall of death that hangs over the novel.  Not only are entire civilizations wiped out (including one character's home), but some of the story's principals, whom we've grown to love and care about over the course of the book, are also killed outright.  As such, this book is probably too intense (not to mention a tad too complicated) for young teens.  For adults, it's possible that some will feel that the pieces all fall into place a little too easily at the end.  After the long build up (several hundred pages) of backstabbing, distrust, double-dealing, and planned betrayals, things actually unravel pretty quickly, but not necessarily in a way that all readers will approve.  All of which is not to take anything (or at least very much) away from Vinge's achievement, which is a brilliantly conceived cosmos of varying physical laws that gives rise to a bewildering variety of intelligences, some few of which are human and/or realistic enough to make us care about their fates.ws that gives rise to a bewildering variety of intelligences, some few of which are human and/or realistic enough to make us care about their fates.	2002-09-03

While the stories are sequential (at least in the work proper - this edition also includes some first-person narratives that fit contextually, but are actually outside the body of the original work) - and unified (all take place in a small portion of Maine, and takes place over the course of one summer), there's no real overlying plot or climax to the book, and blessed little action.  Instead, the reader is treated to a few relaxing months in the country, with nothing to do but listen to the crash of the surf, breathe in the pungent smell of the herb garden, and enjoy the nodding conversations of the sparsely-drawn and just-sufficiently-colorful locals.  Beloved and respected relatives abound, and one of the add-on stories even compasses a wedding.  No stress, no worries, and no problems to solve - this is a book that could help one get to sleep on some too-tense evening.  Of course if you're hoping for something a little more from a book, best look elsewhere.  There's really nothing more than light, quiet entertainment here, but it's of such a refined and delightful quality as one rarely finds in the literary canon.  As such, women will probably enjoy this book more than men, and mature readers will probably appreciate it more than young people.  But when you've had enough excitement, and the toils of your savage work day are weighing heavily on you, don't forget that Mrs. Todd will still have a spare room waiting for you in her quiet New England home.	2002-08-25

While best known for such science fiction classics as The Martian Chronicles and the short novel Fahrenheit 451, a significant portion of Bradbury's output is not very sci-fi, and sometimes scarcely even qualifies as fantasy.  First and last, Bradbury's stories are about human emotion, and the setting (be it Mars, Hollywood, or ancient China) merely facilitates the drama for the disturbingly familiar players.<br />The few science fiction stories in this collection are not very notable.  &quot;The Pedestrian&quot; is probably the best, with its strong statement about the rights of the individual. &quot;Embroidery&quot; shows three elderly women trying to create beauty in a world that is crashing around them and so demonstrates Bradbury's penchant for female characters as well as mature ones.  Women's inner strength is also the subject of &quot;The Wilderness&quot; which would fit nicely into the Martian Chronicles collection except that it isn't quite powerful enough.  &quot;A Sound of Thunder&quot; is a very conventional time travel tale that reads like Bradbury imitating Asimov, while &quot;The Golden Apples of the Sun&quot; is the re-telling of an ancient fable in the style of Arthur C. Clarke.  The few fantasies are an odd mixture, but only the lonesome sea monster of &quot;The Foghorn&quot; makes any real impression.<br />Combined, the sci-fi and fantasy pieces make up only about half of this volume's 22 stories; the other half consists of Bradbury's brief glimpses of the real world.  The most memorable is probably &quot;The Fruit at the Bottom of the Bowl&quot; in which a murderer tries to clean up the stain of his crime, but most of the others are all-too forgettable.  Readers will page through tales of bureaucratic indifference, racial bigotry, the tragedy of illiteracy, but always the main theme is loneliness, loneliness, loneliness.  Bradbury's hushed narrative voice is perfect for these kinds of stories, but readers of sci-fi and fantasy may come away less than delighted.  This book feels like a grab bag of stories that didn't make it into any other collections, and really isn't quite up to the author's usually high standard.  Devoted fans will surely enjoy these stories, but few will be impressed by the strength of this collection alone.  Those anxious to discover this fine writer's work would do better to look into the above-mentioned novels, or else the wonderful Machineries of Joy, which shows the author's skill with short stories to much better advantage.agedy of illiteracy, but always the main theme is loneliness, loneliness, loneliness.

The bulk of this volume is comprised of tight, pointed retellings of stories from classical literature: the Greeks, the Bible, and even Shakespeare. By taking a unique slant on some well-known stories, usually with humorous or sardonic overtones, Capek creates modern fables with clearly implied morals that provide practical advice for even the most contemporary readers. Themes range from fear of change, and the importance of the work ethic, to contempt for mob mentality.  By placing these tales in the distant past, he is able to present specific political arguments without too openly offending the powers-of-the-moment.  With his warm humanism, pointed humor, and continuing sociopolitical relevance, Capek should be a great favorite of fans of such political humorists as Art Buchwald and Jimmy Breslin.  With the re-emergence of Eastern/Central Europe from communist domination, it's not too much to hope that Capek's work will soon enjoy the reputation it so richly deserves.	2002-07-25

If you haven't read Jerome K. Jerome's classic Victorian-era comedy &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot;, you really should consider reading it before undertaking this volume, which (in the beginning at least) is heavily laden with<br />references to it.  The plot is rather complicated, and indeed most of the mystery (and the fun) in this book is trying to understand exactly what's going on and why, but suffice it to say that a time traveler on a routine mission unwisely brings back a cat from the past, causing a casual meeting to not take place, and eventually endangering the outcome of WWII.  This is an insanely funny book, with lots of belly laugh despite its substantial length, and just when you feel like the story is bogging down a bit, here comes another unexpected twist.  Willis has some unique answers to the basic conundrums of time travel, but in actuality this isn't much of a science fiction novel.  The focus is on the delightful romances that develop between the exquisitely satiric characters, and the culture clash between the very contemporary time travelers and the socially complex Victorian era.  If you liked Jane Austen's classic &quot;Emma&quot;, this may be your favorite sci-fi/fantasy of all time.  Most readers should agree that it's certainly the funniest.	2002-07-18

The narrator is an intelligent, voluble, fanciful man, who had been a lawyer in his former life, never doubting that he was an essentially good person, fulfilling more than his share of charitable, even altruistic duties, and even taking great pleasure in the realization that he was a better man than most... at least until an incident on a bridge in November taught him that he was not so remarkable a man after all.  After this experience, his self-confidence and self-image are shattered, as is his overall perception of humanity in general.  Unable to go on as he had been, he re-invents himself as part of a plan to try to give meaning to the remains of his broken life.<br />While not as much of a 'downer' book as the above synopsis may sound to some, this is a very sobering story for those who have given little thought to their own moral position in the world.  The narrator's fall from ignorant bliss is universal, or at least common enough that it should strike a disturbing chord with most readers.  Still, the story is perhaps not entirely without hope, and is, of course, told in descriptive language that evokes urban Europe while providing settings that carefully dictate mood and theme as well.  The structure of the essentially one-sided conversation is powerfully riveting, and helps keep this book a quick read despite its weightiness, but the structure is also functional within the context of the story, since the purpose is to convert the reader to the narrator's viewpoint.  Whether this technical tour-de-force actually changes one's life or not, readers should be prompted to re-examine their own lives and values, which in itself can hardly be a bad thing.  This book is not challenging reading, but it challenges the way we live and perceive ourselves.	2002-07-13

Downbelow Station is like a complex spy thriller set in an otherworldly locale.  There are dozens of forces in play, most of them at odds with each other: the space station Pell, Mazian's Fleet, the planet Cyteen, the forces of the Union, the Konstantin family, the curious alien creatures called 'the hisa', fleets of Merchanters, the ambitious captain Signy Mallory, and hosts of others.  Balancing all these forces (or even keeping track of them) is a momentous task, and Cherryh should be applauded for her technical achievement in piecing it all together.<br />But all that aside, this reviewer finds the book far more technically admirable than pleasurable.  Trying to remember who's who, and what they're trying to accomplish, and who they're squaring off against, can be extremely frustrating, especially for a casual reader.  Perhaps those who've read the previous books in this series would be better prepared for the vast array of political and social forces whose intertwinings provide the real plot for this novel.  In any case the bigger problem with this 400 plus page book is that it is positively bone dry.  There is no hint of humor anywhere in this volume, nor is there much sentiment or real emotional impact, largely because the reader's attention is scattered among so many different characters that this reviewer found it difficult to identify with any of them.  Indeed, one could well be halfway through the book and still not know which characters are the heroes and which are the villains.  Surely this is one of the book's strong points from a historical-political perspective, but as an entertainment it's a near-disaster.  If you think science fiction should be fun, or if you like rooting for the good guys to stick it to the bad guys, this book will be a severe disappointment.  On the other hand, if you're a big fan of political intrigue, you might well enjoy a long journey to Cherryh's complex, multi-layered, fully realized worlds.ong journey to Cherryh's complex, multi-layered, fully realized worlds.	2002-07-12

The narrator of the more autobiographical sections is an apparently shiftless student and writer, who spends most of his time shut up in his foul-smelling room in his father's house, working on a novel that focuses on one Dermot Trellis.  Trellis is a scrupulously moral man who is in turn writing a cautionary novel on the consequences of drinking, licentiousness, and other assorted wrongdoing.  Whenever Trellis goes to sleep, his characters take on a life entirely their own, which they can live at their own discretion, so they ambitiously undertake to keep their creator drugged to secure their own freedom.  There are further complications, with plenty of drinking, violence (more threatened and imagined, than real), and plenty of unforgettable conversations (particularly the long, confused colloquy between the demon and the fairy about the fate of humanity).  The poems are also substantial parts of the story, and run the gamut in style from epic tale to drinking songs, but are almost invariably hysterical.  The conclusions neatly tie up the loose ends in such a way as to strongly affirm traditional values, despite the characters' occasional moral lapses.  This book is definitely Irish through and through, so readers who are put off by straight talking, hard drinking working men spouting absurdly bad poetry at every opportunity may wish to pass on this one.  Also, the three-fold plot is sometimes a bit confusing, probably too much so for youngsters, although college age readers might enjoy its feeling of youthful exuberance and freedom.  For the literary-minded, this is one of the comedic classics of the 20th Century, emphatically not to be missed.	2002-07-08

Disappointingly, this volume is almost completely consumed by character and setting, perhaps trying to make up for the shortage of action, which doesn't really take off until the last few dozen pages.  Admittedly, the crisply drawn characters and realistically invoked Martian landscapes were perhaps the best parts of the earlier book, but readers may remember that some of the best characters from Red Mars were killed off, and the new characters introduced are remarkably wooden and dull, while their contributions to the plot are so negligible that one suspects they were added merely as padding, and not because they needed to be there.  As a result, this novel takes forever to get moving - the first 470 pages could easily be cut to a quarter of that length without any harm to the story whatever.  In Red Mars the interior monologues informed the readers of the action taking place as well as providing intimate portraits of the men and women who colonized the planet.  In this installment the monologues seem more like vague ruminations that don't move the plot at all (the first sentence of this review tells you more about the plot than the first couple of hundred pages of this tome), nor do they tell us anything terribly interesting about the characters, let alone make us like them. Robinson clearly had enough material here for a very short novel, and filled it out with the same techniques that worked so well for him in Red Mars, but by keeping the plot effectively a secret from his readers, he leaves us with nothing to do but admire the scenery and listen to some fairly unpleasant (even fanatical) people.  While not exactly a bad book, it's a serious letdown from the majesty of Red Mars.	2002-07-07

But rather than focus on the consequences and historical ramifications of so extraordinary an event, Clarke (with typical British reserve) chooses to keep our attention strictly on the event itself.  The Space Advisory Committee (including representatives of all the populated planets) provides scientific insight, trying to advise across astronomical distances while Commander Norton of the space ship Endeavor (which is the only vessel close enough to intercept) has to worry about the safety of his crew.  Perhaps the most interesting facet of the book is Clarke's decision to leave most of the critical questions unanswered (begging sequels). This very realistic approach to a first contact with another intelligence sends a strong message to a science fiction audience that had perhaps become too used to sensationalism: alien artifacts may be far more likely to reach us than actual aliens, and in either event, communications between the two may not be nearly as simple as it is in the movies.<br />Otherwise Clarke's 22nd century doesn't seem all that advanced.  There are intelligent primates called simps that handle much of the drudgery on board ship, and the commander has two wives on two different planets, but otherwise neither the technology nor the society seems much different from the world of today.  The ship's commanding surgeon is a woman, but that couldn't have seemed all that forward thinking even in 1973, when this book was written, and surely means nothing today.  Wholly lacking is Clarke's mischievous sense of humor; there's nary a hint of human romance, and the plot is not heavy on surprises, either.  Instead, what we have is a very dry, albeit perhaps very realistic prediction of what mankind's first contact with another intelligence might be like, and how circumstances could limit our ability to investigate it.  Overall, it's a good, fast, easy read, with plenty of realism; little that's outrageously surprising, and nothing too absurdly far out.

The novel alternates details of Pota's quiet, melancholy existence with the text of various false starts he makes on the upcoming opus.  Of course it surprises no one when Pota's novel proves to be the very one in the reader's hands. Readers are treated to false starts on such works as \\"Hera\\", \\"God's Wife\\", and the provocatively titled \\"A Sexual Biography of My Wife\\".  None of these are ever completed, or even more than fairly begun before the author is overcome by despair, disgust, or technical problems.  Pota's fascination with women and sex clearly influences all of his attempts, but his safe, comfortable life doesn't provide much inspiration.  So why does our protagonist go on writing at all?  What else is there for him to do?<br />Heller takes pains to show his (fictional) author warts and all, which keeps the book from falling into sappy sentimentality, but one questions just how autobiographical the portrait really is.  As to the story-of-how-the-story-was-written plot, it succeeds more as a primer in the travails of the literary life than as a tour-de-force of radical technique. It's easy to see why the various unfinished pieces were abandoned, since none of them show any real glimmer of promise, and aside from the occasional humorous moments, most are a waste of time to read.  That being the case, this book is recommended only for those who are dedicated devotees of the author, or have always longed to know what it's like to be a writer.  Others will find little of interest here.	2002-07-05

The story opens as Stout wakes up in a hospital after being shot in the head in a Milanese restaurant (or was he?) having just delivered (or not) a \\"sensitive\\" parcel to an agent (of whom?) named Roger Wort.  Confusion is the standard motif of this incomprehensible book, as Stout continues to undergo an endless array of hallucinatory (or are they?) experiences, from encounters with underground organizations of Dentists and Podiatrists (one of too few truly humorous touches) all the way out to alien invaders.  Unfortunately, there's no attempt to wrap up all the twists and turns the story appears to take, and some may feel that the resolution offered in the book's final pages is really no resolution at all.  The circumstances don't allow for anything like characterization, as people change identities right before our eyes, and no one's motivation is ever certain.  By letting us see the world through Stout's eyes, Knight convincingly portrays a man who has absolutely no idea what's going on, but gives us very little reason to care.  As a comedy the book falls rather distinctly short, and in the absence of any moral or philosophical direction, one wonders why this book was even written at all.	2002-07-03
US	49836087	R3FMW4LZNCYWBV	0553208845	36215520	Siddhartha	Books	2	17	33	N	N	Pointing out The Way, Hesse tells a simple story	This short novel reads like a long fable, with a style reminiscent of short story artist Jorge Luis Borges.  The protagonist, Siddhartha, favored son of a Brahmin, leaves his father's house to embark on a spiritual journey.  As a Samana (a self-chastising ascetic) he is attended by his devoted friend Govinda, until they part over the worthiness of the teachings of the renowned holy man Gotama.  Siddhartha falls for the allures of a courtesan named Kamala, and enters into a financial relationship with the merchant Kamaswami.  He takes up drinking and gambling and becomes a wealthy debauchee.  Eventually repulsed by his own moral corruption, he leaves this life behind and becomes the humble assistant to a poor ferryman.  Here he learns to listen to the river, and comes to understand the totality of existence, but only after loving and losing his orphaned son.<br />This book was never a personal favorite of this reviewer, couched as it is in the tropes of eastern religious philosophy, but it neatly encapsulates Hesse's basic doctrine; his other books (e.g. Steppenwolf and Demian) are more focused on the character of the seeker than on the details of the search, and as such are both more novelistic.  Being a fable, and set in an unfamiliar (to many westerners, at least) culture, this book shows a likable (we are told, but readers are welcome to their own opinions - he seems self-centered and shallow to this reviewer) young man, making decisions and taking action without giving us any real clue as to why. Perhaps Hesse meant to show that life is a series of random choices that can only be understood once we have attained wisdom, but that wisdom can only be achieved through spiritual growth, which is itself only the consequence of those same random choices.  Thus reduced, Hesse is telling us to just live life, and trust that it'll all make sense some day.  More useful, perhaps, is what we're told to avoid: complacency, self-deprivation, over-indulgence, all external religious instruction, any kind of obsession or self-absorption.  Obviously there's no magic formula that enables one to make this happen, or everyone would be a sage, but Hesse's books certainly point out a clear set of priorities, whether we buy into them or not.  In sum, Siddhartha is useful enough as fables go, but don't expect miracles from it, even though it's exclusively about ideas, and really isn't much of a novel.  Definitely for those new to spiritual self-examination.igious instruction, any kind of obsession or self-absorption.

Surely most fans of the cyberpunk genre will have already read (and loved) this seminal work, but plenty of surprises await those who are just discovering this peculiar sub-genre.  In a not-too-distant future, Snow Crash is a mysterious newly-emerging virus (does it affect people or their computers?  What's the difference?) It's the story of how a racially diverse everyman named Hiro Protagonist and his feisty young (15!) girlfriend Y.T. have to save the world from a nefarious plot to enslave all humanity.  And who do they turn to for help, but the Mafia?<br />This book is wild, hip, intelligent, sprawling, darkly comic, and a deliberate jibe at many of our culture's basic values (religion, work ethic, etc...).  It's a highly detailed futuristic sci-fi adventure into epistemology, virtual reality, Oriental sword fighting, and of course, skateboarding.  Bizarre characters inhabiting bizarre cultures in two very bizarre worlds (real and virtual) lead readers through an unforgettable adventure, filled with action, fun, and sardonic silliness.  The modest levels of sex and violence are handled with such breezy unreality that there's no shock value to upset more fastidious readers, although younger teens may find this book too long for their liking.  Some sections seem to move pretty slowly (Hiro's researches, for example), but there's so much to love about Shepherdson's 21st Century America that most readers will surely want to wade through this tome's 500-plus pages more than once.	2002-06-20

The Maples fight, drink, and sex their way through life, somehow still managing to find a little happiness.  This book, comprised of a number of related short stories, is highly evocative of the mood of the early sixties.  The gender roles and sexual repression of earlier decades was giving way to a new kind of freedom, but there was still an awful price to be paid in anger, in jealousy, in heartbreak.  Yet somehow, this book explains, life goes on; stands are taken, moves are made, and children are raised, despite all the unpleasantness.  The stories are told from the husband's point of view, so it seems odd that we don't get a very clear picture of the 'other woman' who causes so much trouble.  But the really big question that hangs over this melancholy little volume is: Why are these people so hung up on sex?  Updike takes pains to show how much these people care for each other, but somehow they still can't seem to be satisfied with each other.  No answers are offered here, but no judgments are passed, either.  Essentially, we're presented with a novel of manners that documents (for future generations) a particular time and lifestyle.<br />As always, Updike's prose is as flawless as his characters are flawed. Confused, weak, vacillating, frequently suffering from some self-inflicted or psychosomatic ailment, Richard is the everyman we don't want to glorify even though we see much of ourselves in him.  His more conservative wife Joan feels herself trapped in a pit of self-righteous indignation.  Together they feed off each other's neuroses until the inevitable occurs.  This is not a happy book, but it doesn't have a powerfully tragic feel either.  It's almost as though Updike had written these stories about his own failed relationships, from which he'd since moved on, but which still bore a kind of nostalgic, wistful glow.  A lovely book, although not a spectacular one, aimed at those who enjoy analyzing relationships, rather than those who expect big things to actually happen.book, although not a spectacular one, aimed at those who enjoy analyzing relationships, rather than those who expect big things to actually happen.	2002-05-28
US	49836087	R2OM20SAFCWKND	0553573349	493311631	Starborne	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Solid sci-fi romance; short on originality	Fifty brilliant men and women set off on an interstellar expedition to find a new home for humanity and end up discovering - themselves.  That hokey summary aside, though, this is a solid novel from sci-fi grandmaster Robert Silverberg, featuring good characterizations, a believable star voyage, and some unusual planetary discoveries.  This book borrows heavily from Robert Heinlein's fine juvenile Time for the Stars, which also features one half of a pair of identical twins who communicate telepathically in order to keep their star-going vessel in contact with earth.  Like Heinlein's book, there's a strong element of the psychological mixed in with occasional landings on unknown planets, and extensive descriptions of the ship and its sociopolitical structure, although it should be admitted that Heinlein covers this territory far more thoroughly and convincingly.  Where this book differs from Heinlein's is in the characters, who are much more grown up, and whose strengths and weaknesses are discussed more frankly than in Heinlein's book, which is told in the first person by a not-so-insightful teenaged boy.  Unfortunately, for a book that is so strongly character-based, the year-captain, the explorer Huw, and Noelle, the blind telepath, don't seem all that overpoweringly realistic.  Their behavior strikes one as too consistently rational, predictable, and altruistic. Quite a bit of this book focuses on irrelevancies like playing Go, the year-captain's longing to relinquish his authority, and the burgeoning romances between the main characters.  The conclusion is pretty standard fare to most sci-fi readers, and has been done much more effectively by other writers.  Overall, the thing most missing from this novel is originality, something that is usually Silverberg's strength.  He took the situation from one novel and his conclusion from another, and tried to go into a little more depth psychologically than is common, but he doesn't seem to have much really new to offer.  There's virtually no slam/bang action in this story; it's a story about relationships, so young women who are into sc-fi will probably enjoy this more than their male counterparts.  This doesn't mean the novel isn't an engrossing entertainment, but it's certainly not Silverberg's best.r.

US	49836087	R5INQ3MN1FBK0	0679736654	738686232	A Scanner Darkly	Books	5	10	14	N	N	A nightmare of drugs, deterioration, and paranoia	A horrible addictive drug known as Substance D (a.k.a. \\"Slow Death\\") destroys the minds of dopers and undercover officers alike in this powerful novel of the not-too-distant future.  In the paranoid world where discovery means death, narcotics police keep their identities secret from everyone  - even their superiors - so that undercover agent Bob Arctor is unsurprised to find that he's been assigned to watch... himself.  He lures his brain-fried housemates on a road trip so that his home can be appropriately bugged, and later watches the endless hours of tapes of himself and his friends getting stoned, holding deliciously absurd conversations, and generally living their sad, silly lives.  As we watch their drug-sodden brains deteriorate, there's another intriguing plot thread at work - someone seems to be out to get our hero.  Are the dopers on to him?  Is there some wild cosmic conspiracy at work?  Or is he just being paranoid?<br />Equally interesting is how Bob deals with a common moral dilemma: how to be a good person in an imperfect world.  This is most obvious in Bob's dealings with women.  He recognizes his inability to help the battered woman at the apartment house.  He finds himself strongly attracted to the elusive Donna even as he uses her to buy drugs and meet still-bigger dealers.  Can he help her?  Or must he betray her?  Of course the true nature of their relationship (and Bob's astounding sacrifice) doesn't become clear until the very end, which is painful enough that some readers might be tempted to rush through it - don't - a great deal is explained in the last dozen pages.  In fact without spoiling the story, it's safe to say that readers don't actually know what the real plot of this book is until they've read the conclusion.  Neither does Bob, and we're pretty much trapped in his disintegrating world-view.  Thus his final Pyrrhic victory doesn't have the uplifting effect one looks for in a tragedy.  Readers will certainly pity Bob Arctor, but the terror remains long after the book is over.  Granted, the wild-eyed paranoid ravings of the addicts are deliciously funny, as are some of the ironies of Bob's situation, but watching Bob's mental collapse in the third act is far too heavy to consider this book a comedy.  Rather Dick has succeeded in working some levity into what is in fact an incredibly serious, and ultimately tragic story.  Based in part on Dick's own personal experiences with addictive drugs, this is a novel more for drug culture insiders, who will quickly see the veracity of every far out scene, than for non-users, who may find this book not so much science fiction as just plain crazy.the terror remains long after the book is over.

Grim determinism pervades the lives of an emotionally troubled family in the American South in this gripping novel by Flannery O'Connor.  Female characters are curiously absent, unable to survive the withering glare of white-hot emotions that drive the old uncle, his schoolteacher nephew, and his nephew and son.  All of these men have been damaged - perhaps beyond repair - by the intensely unforgiving monomania with which the old man pursues his Christian mission as a 'prophet'.  O'Connor explores how such deeply ingrained childhood experiences can compromise a boy's world view, and leave him a helpless outsider for the rest of his life.  The old man fritters away his days railing against a world that sees him as insane.  The schoolteacher, for all that he feels he has freed himself from the old man's obsession, not only finds himself fighting perverse impulses, but allows himself to fall into the opposite trap, putting too much faith in science and intellect and failing to recognize the importance of the unseen, the unheard, and the unmeasurable.  The schoolteacher's nephew Francis Tarwater, the protagonist in the story, bitterly refutes both of these legacies, determined to live his own life and follow his own personal, hard-won brand of individualism.  The progress he makes toward his ultimate fate is at once terrifying, inevitable, and unforgettable.<br />Despite its religious tropes, this book is not so much a critique of Christianity as it is about a certain kind of mental illness - an obsessive/compulsive disorder that creates an intellectual tunnel vision. The failed relationships this engenders only exacerbate the situation, and leave the sufferer feeling ostracized and angry, encouraging further antisocial acts. O'Connor is more interested in showing how the cycle of violent, antisocial behavior works than in offering advice, so the net result is more depressing than uplifting, but one can hope that modern psychiatric medicine might have found a way to help these people.  This is not an entertaining book, but it is brief and throat-grabbingly powerful.  Its unrelenting intensity is not for everyone, but it definitely rates as a classic example of Southern Gothic literature.elp these people.

These lessons aside, there really isn't much to the story. Ethan is a proud New Englander torn between his loyalty for his sickly, antagonistic wife, and the fresh and desirable young Mattie with whom he is falling in love.  Overall, the story moves pretty slowly, building towards one final, selfish act.  There really isn't a lot of subtle insight into Ethan's personality - he's far more one-dimensional than is commonly recognized, and the novel suffers from being overripe with melodrama.  This book might be popular among teen-aged 'drama queens' who may be impressed with the way that Ethan's deeply felt emotions and weakness for the Grand Gesture echo their own personal longings for a passionate life (or possibly mate), but many readers will find this story either pointlessly depressing (the romantics), or an exemplar for brutal divine justice (the moralists).  With its excessive seriousness and self-importance, no wonder so many high school students are turned off by classic literature.  This story's setting seems as far removed from the 21st Century as Robinson Crusoe, and the plot scarcely merits more than a good short story.  Understandably, the modern high school needs to teach books that make valid points and use literary devices, etc., but if these books completely fail to entertain, we risk raising a generation of young people for whom reading fiction is a tedious chore rather than a treasured opportunity.	2002-04-12

The first half of this book is the story of Vergil<br />Ulam, a secretive research scientist developing microscopic biological computers who stumbles onto something much more than he bargained for.  The focus is clearly on Vergil, his personal struggles with his employers, his mother, and his own social ineptitude.  Readers will watch with fascination and horror as Vergil opens a biological Pandora's box, and wonder just how he's going to get out of the mess he's created.  But it seems Bear wanted to go beyond Vergil's problems to the story of the nanotech beings themselves, so he wrote another (virtually) separate story describing the nanites spread, and after the auspicious beginning, this second half is a considerable disappointment.  The point of view shifts away from Vergil to a number of different characters, some of whom were bit players in the first part, but many of whom are introduced for the first time in the second half.  Plus, there's a lot of jumping around between these characters, each having something to show us (although it's often very little), but none of them ever becoming a strong enough central character to hold this part of the book together, leaving this second half painfully unfocused, and almost entirely disconnected from the characters and events of the first half.<br />Recapping, the first half of this book is tightly written and powerful, with a strong central protagonist whose motivations and character are carefully delineated.  Bear includes enough scientific background to make his plot plausible, and given recent technological breakthroughs in nanotechnology, his story doesn't seem half as wild as it must have been 15 years ago.<br />Gripping and suspenseful, this first 'sub-novel' easily deserves a 5 star rating, but the latter section is hardly worthy of a  masterpiece.  Rambling, unfocused, and extrapolating way over his head, Bear leaves us with a hopelessly ambiguous ending that seriously undercuts the story - like reading a mystery that never reveals the solution. Overall, this is one very intense novel with a slow second act and no third act to speak of.  The 3 star rating is an attempt to reflect the duality of this volume, which is really anything but average.s a 5 star rating, but the latter section is hardly worthy of a  masterpiece.

The story opens with a brutal<br />murder that takes place amidst the buzz of the annual festival.  From there,<br />we go on an extended flashback that describes how the original 100 settlers<br />(a sampling of the world's brightest, if not necessarily most stable minds)<br />first colonized Mars.  Summarizing their training, we get to know many of<br />the personalities intimately on the long voyage out, and as the initial<br />settlement is established.  Like Faulkner, Robinson changes the point of<br />view with each section to give a variety of viewpoints on what was done and<br />why, allowing the reader to decide who is right and who is wrong.  Returning<br />to the present, we see the fruits of their labors: several domed cities,<br />thousands of residents, a working space elevator (based on the Arthur C.<br />Clarke design), and a radical genetic treatment that will vastly alter what<br />it means to be human.  But there are dangers present as well, and the<br />resulting catastrophe makes for an unforgettable climax to a masterfully<br />told story.<br />There's a lot to love about this book: the painstakingly detailed<br />descriptions of the Martian landscape, the attendant environmental concerns,<br />the even more pressing psychosocial problems, the mysteries of the stowaway<br />and the lost colony and the assassination all work together to form a Mars<br />that is more alive than any other.  The powerful personalities at play in<br />this story, and their failure to come to terms with the greater issues at<br />stake, set this book apart from everything else in the field.  A simply<br />overwhelming experience that doesn't let up through 500 pages; this reviewer<br />read it in less than a week, it was so gripping.  Some day, man may really<br />try to conquer the planets, but for today, Red Mars is the next best thing<br />to being there.	2002-04-07

The slightly backward, small southern town of Clay is the setting for Edna Earle's rambling tale of her Uncle Daniel Ponder and his unique eccentricities.  While perhaps not exciting (or readable) enough for the youngest teens, adult readers should enjoy this madcap window on southern life.<br />Uncle Daniel is a simple, gentle, kindly, guileless, and above all generous soul, who loves to give things away.  Fortunately, Grandpa Ponder is \\"rich as Croesus\\", but even his resources are limited.  In an effort to find someone to give more things to, Uncle Daniel becomes enamored of one Bonnie Dee Peacock, a suitably mindless twit who agrees marry him \\"on trial\\".  Things are rocky enough for the happy couple, when an unexpected death<br />throws the whole town into turmoil.  The book's conclusion may seem silly to some, but is not so very unbelievable given the context.<br />The only thing to be said against this precious little gem of a book is that it doesn't have much of an impact - there are no great issues being debated here, or at least the aren't presented explicitly.  Reading between the lines though, some fundamental human values are being affirmed, to wit: family loyalty, kindness toward those with special needs, and good old-fashioned Christian charity.  A delightful, uniquely American entertainment, even if it is rather light weight.	2002-03-29

Through the person of Lanik Mueller, former heir to the throne of a powerful nation, but now exiled due to a debilitating genetic defect, Card takes his readers on a journey<br />through the various states on Treason, each founded by a different would-be revolutionary, each facing unique geographical challenges, and each showing a remarkable resiliency in thriving despite the harshest of circumstances.<br />Will Lanik ever be allowed to assume his rightful place as ruler of Mueller, or does some other fate await this unfortunate young man?  Be prepared to be floored again and again as Card throws us one mind-blowing surprise after another.<br />This is not exactly a science fiction novel, although Card does a fair job of making some of the wilder discoveries seem reasonable.  After all, a lot can happen in 3000 years.  The real focus isn't on the science, but on the diverse social and geographic settings, the breathtaking revelations, and on action that features a scorched-earth brutality seldom seen in this kind of book as our hero finds himself thrown into a series of ever-worsening situations.  Warning: Mueller's society possesses genetic skills that allow Lanik to regenerate lost limbs and damaged organs, and Card includes plenty of distressingly gruesome scenes that call this into play, so this book is not recommended to the young or squeamish, especially since, while there are no sexual acts in the story, there are some sexually charged situations, (beginning when our young male hero grows breasts) that go far beyond standard prime-time sitcom innuendo.  Don't let the easy reading and thrill-a-minute action fool you - this book is not for kids.<br />But if you're not easily put off by graphic scenes of people being hacked up, and you aren't hung up on the whole plausibility thing, and you're up for a traumatic-shock-filled adventure, this book's the real deal.y thing, and you're up for a traumatic-shock-filled adventure, this book's the real deal.	2002-03-23

Niel Herbert is a sensitive, but substantial young man who makes the acquaintance of Captain and Mrs. Forrester, the town's leading citizens.  Captain Forrester had been a railroad man - a builder, one could almost say a conqueror, who had originally chosen this out-of-the-way Midwestern train stop to make his home.  His wife Marian, 25 years his junior, is the woman every man in town desires, and whom every woman in town envies.  A native of California, she has grace, beauty, and youthful energy.  She respects her husband's money and power and social position, but we don't often get the impression that she loves him.  Instead, her head has been turned by a smarmy young gold-digger.<br />In a story that is more about characters than about action, motivations often start out hazy, and only gradually come into focus.  It quickly becomes obvious that Niel is in love with Mrs. Forrester, and that Ivy Peters (the underhanded lawyer Marian hires) is an ugly sadistic snake.  Less clear is the nature of the relationship between the Captain and his wife, which seems founded more on mutual admiration than on love.  And ever present through the novel are the geographic, social and economic realities of the declining frontier town, which had once been rich and abundant with promise, but which has become choked with a citizenry that has neither the unforced elegance of Mrs. Forrester, nor the strength and vision of her husband.  The Captain shows his strong social conscience by supporting the bank, even when it takes a toll on his own solvency.  Compare this with his wife's willingness to allow Ivy any latitude in getting her what she wants, regardless of who suffers.  Cather shows parallels between the decline of the social order and the destruction (exploitation) of America's natural beauty and resources, and lays the blame not only on those small-minded, shortsighted individuals who sacrificed things that were good and true for their own immediate personal gratification, but also on those who saw it happening and failed to stop it.  Mrs. Forrester can always move to another frontier, or find herself another rich husband, but who will repair the dust bowls that she leaves behind?<br />This novel is a quick and easy read, and while there are intimations of sexual encounters, none are portrayed so graphically that modern teens would be likely to be shocked, although most will find the story a little too dry for their tastes.  Many adults will probably feel the same way.  There is no real humor in this book, and little that could be called uplifting, either, so while this book makes powerful statements about society, the roles of women, and the need to protect our natural environment, it should only be recommended to those who are devotees of serious literature.nd resources, and lays the blame not only on those small-minded, shortsighted individuals who sacrificed things that were good and true for their own immediate personal gratification, but also on those who saw it happening and failed to stop it.

Although one applauds Bloom's acumen in<br />choosing Bradbury as a subject worthy of elucidation, the actual essays<br />selected are really rather disappointing.  Perhaps the fault lies not with<br />the editor (whose bona fides are so widely recognized), but with a general<br />dearth of meritorious criticism regarding an author who works principally in<br />the literary ghetto that is known as 'genre' fiction.  Most of the scholars<br />represented here have picked up some specific quality that seems noteworthy<br />in a few of his works, and have explicated this quality in some detail, but<br />none seem able to view the man's work as a whole, or evaluate its overall<br />import.  Perhaps closest is William F.

More commonplace are Diskin's &quot;Bradbury on Children&quot;, and<br />Hazel Pierce's &quot;Ray Bradbury and the Gothic Tradition&quot;, with emphasis on the<br />horror genre, and the pieces by Wayne Johnson and Gary Wolfe, which focus<br />more on the famous sci-fi collection The Martian Chronicles.  It is typical<br />of the narrow focus of this volume that only Kevin Hoskinson's fascinating<br />political study &quot;Ray Bradbury's Cold War Novels&quot; does more than mention the<br />master's finest novel, Fahrenheit 451.  This reviewer would much rather have<br />seen some in-depth analysis of Bradbury's style (which is surely one of his<br />strong points), and more attention given to his many short stories, which<br />are certainly superior to most of his novels.

At this point in his life, at the more mature age of 60 or so, Chinaski (Bukowski's fictional alter ego) isn't the hopeless drunk he appears to have been in his younger days.  His lady friend (whom he stays with for the<br />entirety of the book - perhaps a record) tries to keep him off the hard stuff, and is usually pretty successful, so there's almost none of the helplessness, depression, womanizing, and self-destructive behavior that we most associate with Bukowski's work.  Spurred on by a relentless producer who is determined to make a film by the Great Chinaski, Hank spends 22 days churning out a screenplay, much against his own better judgment. We stay<br />with Chinaski through the meetings, the parties, the desperate ploys for financing, the scouting for locations, and some of the actual shooting itself, and through it all a vision forms of how independent films actually get made.  The most entertaining part of the story is Buk's descriptions of the moviemakers themselves and the odd lifestyle that forces them to live in abject poverty while working on films that may gross millions of dollars.  There are a couple of hard-edged scenes, but this book really isn't Bukowski at his hard-core worst.  As a result, some of his fans will probably consider this book pretty lightweight - a mere diary of how he happened to make a movie, rather than the painful confession of his own inadequacies we've seen so often and grown to love.  Still Bukowski is Bukowski, and his dry, cynical attitude can't help but color every landscape he sets his gaze upon (usually gray) and turn every word from his mouth into an obscenity (you know the usual monosyllables), so not everyone will find this book quite to their taste.  While nowhere near as depraved as some of his earlier fiction, this novel is not for kids, or the prudish, and may strike some as crude, amoral, disgusting, and brutish, while die-hard fans may be disappointed in this kinder, gentler, mellower Bukowski.  For the rest of us, this fascinating story, told in earthy,  straightforward prose, provides a rare glimpse into the world of independent filmmaking.ay strike some as crude, amoral, disgusting, and brutish, while die-hard fans may be disappointed in this kinder, gentler, mellower Bukowski.

Pol Det is the inheritor of Randoval, the lordly castle of a magical kingdom in another dimension, and Mark Marakson is the genius of engineering and technology.  Old Mor, a wizard from the magical realm, switches these two as babies, hoping to avert a recurrence of the cataclysm that has so often ravaged his world.  In the technological realm, Pol is a guitarist, a detached dreamer who never seems to fit in.  In the magical world, Mark's mechanical inventions frighten and anger a community that associates science with destruction.  Only the beautiful Nora seems to understand Mark's passion, skill, and frustration.  Will these two young men ever discover the secret of their linked destinies?  If so, will they become fast friends or mortal enemies?  And what role will be played by the mysterious thief who has purloined some valuable figurines, and the hidden caverns full of sleeping dragons?<br />Overall, this is a modest entertainment with a fascinating setup that too-quickly deteriorates into just another tale of spells and dragons and talismans and so on.  Zelazny's fiction is notable for its experiments in form as well as substance, and this book shows every promise of being much more than it finally turns out to be.  He effectively defines the process used to work magic spells, he creates characters with a little more than just one flat dimension, he pits his magician against technological forces that go well past swords and catapults, and manages to surprise us more than once, but still doesn't quite deliver the kind of masterpiece we feel the story merited.  We expect more from Zelazny, and we almost think we are going to get it, but around page 80 or so, he abandons subtleties like character study and opts instead for the more prosaic quest-for-powerful-weapons-to-defeat-the-bad-guy material.  From that point<br />on this book is pretty average, almost as though the author tired of struggling to keep his story innovative and original and just went ahead with standard dragons-and-sorcerers fare.  This is not to say that fantasy fans won't enjoy it; this reader's disappointment rather stems from the recognition of just how close Zelazny came to revolutionizing the whole form, before frittering the opportunity away.s book is pretty average, almost as though the author tired of struggling to keep his story innovative and original and just went ahead with standard dragons-and-sorcerers fare.

US	49836087	R8CPBSTQKWJBF	0671829343	557461183	The Cosmic Rape	Books	2	2	3	N	N	Two excellent ideas and a hundred pages of filler	Theodore Sturgeon is one of the grandmasters of the sci-fi genre and this story's unusual take on the old alien invasion theme is almost as refreshingly different today as it must have been decades ago when it first appeared, but nonetheless it can hardly be considered one of his masterpieces.  The original short story on which this novel was based was probably closer to the right length than this sprawling, disparate mess of a novel. Sturgeon has a couple of clever ideas here, but one of them has to be saved for the climax and the other has to be laid out from the very beginning, and that leaves a long, drawn out middle section that may try some readers' patience.  There's clearly a point to this volume's slightly experimental, disjointed structure, so devoted readers shouldn't be too quick to abandon the book midway through, but the sad fact is that the clever conclusion really doesn't justify the often-tedious reading, despite this book's relative brevity.<br />Without giving away too much of the plot, an interplanetary group mind called the Medusa makes contact with a down and out loser through whom they hope to first unify, and then absorb, the entire human race.  Having established this, Sturgeon takes us into a long string of subplots, or rather something less than subplots, representing the extreme diversity and fragmentation of contemporary human experience.  Unfortunately, most of these vignettes are not science fiction, and don't compare favorably with similar pieces of human drama as written by, say, John O'Hara or Anton Chekhov.  Not that Sturgeon isn't capable of bringing off something of that ilk - his brilliant short story \\"Bright Segment\\" certainly qualifies as being that good, but the pieces featured here simply don't measure up, especially with no sci-fi legerdemain to save them from ordinariness.  Only the conclusion is really up to Sturgeon's standard, and by that time, many readers will have stopped caring.	2002-02-20

At the onset of WWII, divorced thirty-something Guy Crouchback anxiously longs to serve his country in its time of need, but can't find a branch of service that wants him.  By the end of this book, his training completed, he begins to wonder if his country (represented by its armed forces) really knows what's good for it.  This book is a fairly realistic and often rather lighthearted look at the training received by an officer of the Halberdiers during the early days of WWII, before the true terrors and horrors of that conflict had become apparent.  This volume contains some fine portraits and vignettes from British army life, after which an officer's death and the questions of responsibility it raises cause Crouchback to doubt the wisdom of his beloved leaders.<br />Some of the more humorous moments include the incidents involving Apthorpe's port-a-john (not as disgusting as you might fear), Crouchback's attempted reconciliation with his wife, and the ego-driven absurdities that lead to the Brigadier's reconnaissance mission, but the humor is of the dry British<br />sort, with few of the belly laughs that make books like Catch 22 so unforgettable.  Rather more to the point is the mildly biting satire exposing how ill prepared for war Britain really was at the time, particularly in light of the high price Europe paid for that negligence.<br />While this reviewer certainly enjoyed the book, its target audience is probably not as broad today as it would have been forty years ago.  Veterans of the armed forces who are interested in a nostalgic look back at this era will probably get the most out of it, followed by admirers of the gentle art<br />of British humor, while on the other hand, women looking for romantic adventure will find very little femininity in the book, and Gen-Xers hoping to read another 'Catch 22' or 'MASH', will likely find the story dry and insipid.  So don't go into this book looking for a comedy - it stands better as a fictionalized portrayal of a particular time and place in history.l likely find the story dry and insipid.

This is the question that Larry Niven has asked perhaps as often as any writer in history, and he presents some more of his most fascinating answers in this marvelous sci-fi adventure novel. Somewhere in another solar system, the atmosphere from a dying planet has leaked out into a vast gas torus in which live enormous trees, anchored solely by gravity, gathering light from the sun and nutrients from the thin<br />atmosphere, and strangely enough, inhabited by a society of hunters and gatherers.  Life has been getting tougher on the tree recently; so much so that partly in desperation, and partly out of malice, the Chairman sends an adolescent boy, a student of the sciences, and a powerful young hunter up the trunk of the tree with a ragtag bunch of misfits to find food to save the tribe - or failing that, to die trying.  Following the adventures of this group provides a keen insight into their unique culture and how it has survived, but gives only a few clues as to where they came from and why. Balancing the hunting party's amazing adventures is a series of interludes featuring the Checker, a distant, computerized personality who has a strange fascination with the fledgling society.  Niven's combination of dry scientific records and intimate sociological observations teases the reader into playing anthropologist, trying to piece together what exactly happened to create this situation in the first place.  Beyond this, there's plenty of<br />action and more than a few total, out-of-the-blue-sky surprises, so readers should find this story as entertaining as it is intriguing.  Moreover, Niven's ability to make his scientific points believably is unparalleled. While not as philosophically daring as Ringworld or The Mote in God's Eye, this is a top-notch sci-fi adventure for readers of all ages.	2002-02-11

This time around, Wolff's evil father has kidnapped his beautiful wife Chryseis.  To find her, he sets off through a series of hexacular gates, each of which takes him and his fractious siblings to a new and more challenging world where an endless series of traps, dangers, and<br />difficulties await.  Will Wolff be able to rescue his wife from the horrible fate that awaits her?  Was there ever any doubt?<br />The specific ploy Wolff comes up with to defeat the villain is pretty clever, and is probably the best part of the book, which overall is just the same old same old.  Instead of displaced societies, this volume's worlds feature geographic problems that the group has to overcome in order to get through the next gate. The result is a lot less swordplay and a lot more death trekking, not really Farmer's forte.  The excitement level is pretty low, and the suspense level is almost non-existent, since many will guess the kidnapper's secret well before it is revealed, and many more will have stopped caring long before then.  Farmer's characters are painfully flat; some of the siblings are no more than cannon fodder, while even the more important characters just strike the same single note over and  over.  As a result, the reader never cares whether the party succeeds in their venture or not.  (This reader was even tempted to start hoping the villain would just kill them all off and spare us all any more unpleasantness).  Wolff is a capable leader and combatant, but he has few other human qualities of any interest, and his siblings are plain irritating.  So even though this book starts much faster and has a stronger ending than its predecessor, there still isn't much to like about it. Younger readers who can handle brutal, pointless violence may find this book a welcome diversion, but so far, this is the weakest series Farmer has written.  Will A Private Cosmos be any better?

Orphaned at a young age when her father is imprisoned for her little sister's death, Kathleen grows up quiet and seemingly untouchable in a series of inhospitable environments while<br />disaster waits at every turn.  Kathleen is an archetype of the cowed young woman: possessing little enough intelligence, not really much given to introspection, lacking any confidence or self-esteem, able to learn what she is taught by breaking everything down into simple tasks, but never really seeing the big picture.  Naturally men take advantage of her, but Kathleen won't let their degradations affect her calm demeanor.  What she doesn't see is how living without love has warped her own personality.  Again and again we see her lashing out at the innocent because she can't bring herself to confront the people who are really offending her.<br />Oates avoids melodrama in this powerful story by describing everything - even the most graphically gruesome scenes - in a very objective, detached, one could say clinical, narrative voice.  Kathleen breaks these too into sequences of small but individual events so that she can more easily control, or ignore, or perhaps justify, the suffering that seems to permeate her entire world.  We find ourselves wanting to forgive even her most wanton acts because we recognize how little she really understands of human kindness, never having experienced much of it.  The world is full of women like Kathleen, who have been born into pain and violence, and who have no hope of ever understanding anything else.  In this grim and almost gothic novel, Joyce Carol Oates weeps for those for whom life on Earth is not a rise, but a fall.  This is not a pleasant book - most readers will be shocked, disgusted, or at the very least depressed by it, but the author clearly has tried to make a real difference in how we perceive the quiet, solitary, seemingly dispassionate woman who lives next door.a real difference in how we perceive the quiet, solitary, seemingly dispassionate woman who lives next door.	2002-02-01

Man as a thinking creature is helpless in this environment, and the world is best suited for those beings who can somehow intuit the appropriate action.  Vance tries to show (with limited success) that logic is only one way of dealing with the universe, and it may not always be the best way.  Unfortunately, the idea of a world governed by no natural laws at all is so ethereal that even Vance can't really bring it off; instead we get only the helplessness and desperation of creatures who are about to die.  &quot;Hard Luck Diggings&quot; shows sci-fi detective Magnus Ridolph finding out who is killing the workers on a distant planet.  &quot;First Star I See Tonight&quot; covers the murder mystery from the other direction, as an unscrupulous astronomer finds a short cut to advancing his career.  Neither of these stories are particularly memorable, although &quot;Star&quot;, with its unexpected ending is probably the better of the two.  A little more wildly imaginative is &quot;The Potters of Firsk&quot; wherein the urn-makers on a distant planet use human bones for their pottery until a desperate bureaucrat teaches them the secret of yellow glaze.  &quot;Noise&quot; is a very strange, almost poetic piece about a man marooned alone on an unknown planet who comes to doubt his own sanity.  Is his colorful world of faerie life forms real, or a product of his overstressed mind?<br />Vance has some fascinating ideas here, but his execution is not always up to par in these early stories.  But surely the biggest problem with this collection is its brevity.  Ignoring the unfinished children's story &quot;Cat Island&quot;, a published interview, and &quot;A Vance Encyclopedia&quot;, readers get less than 90 pages of science fiction for their money.  With the lengthy introduction by Russel Letson, this edition clearly is intended more for scholars of Vance's work than for his fans.or their money.

The first half of this book is all palace intrigue, which drags at times, but it's the second half, featuring a tedious trek across a glacier that really tries the reader's patience.  Still, there's no denying LeGuin's achievement in creating a whole new world, with its own language, weather, food, societies, religion, even its own unique ...  Not since Herbert's Dune has such a complete, functioning world been created for us.  Too bad LeGuin didn't know what to do with her world once she'd created it.  There's no action, little enough real character development, maybe a certain sense of adventure, but after all Jack London covered treks through bitter cold weather very satisfactorily many years ago.  Most entertaining is the scene where Genry visits a cloistered sect that practices divination; here LeGuin uses suspense and elegant prose to create a very powerful effect.  Apart from that chapter though, there's not much to get excited about.  Students of the sci-fi genre should be intrigued by the subtle way LeGuin builds her new setting, but action/adventure fans will likely find this book a chore to read simply because so little actually happens.  A bit more plot would have perhaps deflected attention from the love story that LeGuin seems so anxious to tell, but the end result would have been much more enjoyable reading for the mass audience.	2002-01-10

Most of the action takes place in the Pacific States of America - the section of the former USA now administered by Japan.  The world has been much transformed by fascism; Africa has suffered an unprecedented holocaust, the Mediterranean has been drained, and the former USA has been split into three different partitions - German in the east, Japanese in the far west, and a central region that is still free.  Given this ambitious backdrop, Dick chooses to tell a very small story, following just a few characters through the events of just a few weeks.<br />When the story opens Americans have been pretty thoroughly cowed.  The animosity that characterized the early years of reconstruction has given way to an acceptance, a recognition that life goes on despite the changes imposed from abroad.  Frank Frink and his estranged wife Juliana are ordinary working people, skilled laborers, struggling just to get along in a world where they are effectively second-class citizens.  A Mr. Childan deals in antique American artifacts, selling America's heritage to his wealthy Japanese clients who are all too eager to own a memento of the time when America was young and powerful.  Mr. Tagomi, a high official of the ranking Trade Mission, is preparing for an important visit by Mr. Baynes, ostensibly a Swedish industrialist.  Beneath the surface, deeply ingrained prejudices, frustrations, and repressed anger interfere with the simplest decisions while the reclusive Abendsen's alternate history novel, The Grasshopper Lies Heavy, captures the public's imagination with a fantastic tale of what the world might be like if the Allies had won the war.<br />Dick has written a remarkably clever novel of ideas here, and makes it move with remarkable power and suspense.  There isn't too much action, certainly no war, so adventure lovers may not find this book particularly to their taste, and the ending certainly leaves the reader wanting more, but the subtleties in the behavior of the different social classes to each other, the underhanded way the lower classes try to cheat their so-called superiors, the way the upper classes manipulate their social inferiors, the widespread reliance on the I Ching to search for answers within, and Dick's sardonic view of his own position in the world as shown in the character of Abendsen, all combine to give a remarkably clear vision of how things not only might have been different, but also of how things might have been the same - the winners oppress the losers no matter what their backgrounds.larly to their taste, and the ending certainly leaves the reader wanting more, but the subtleties in the behavior of the different social classes to each other, the underhanded way the lower classes try to cheat their so-called superiors, the way the upper classes manipulate their social inferiors, the widespread reliance on the I Ching to search for answers within, and Dick's sardonic view of his own position in the world as shown in the character of Abendsen, all combine to give a remarkably clear vision of how things not only might have been different, but also of how things might have been the same - the winners oppress the losers no matter what their backgrounds.	2002-01-04

There's no time for character development or detailed scientific explanations in this one - once Robert Wolff hears that trumpet call and pops through a hole into another world, everybody's too busy swinging and ducking to philosophize much.  But as with Farmer's truly brilliant Riverworld series, the extreme breadth of physical settings and social groups keeps readers constantly wondering what comes next.  The whole adventure takes place on an other-dimensional world shaped like a giant wedding cake, with different societies existing on each tier, and the quest structure ensures constant movement from one locale to another.  The plot is painfully simplistic, and quickly breaks down into a pattern of travel sequences followed by fight scenes, whereas more space could've been devoted to establishing motivations, and explaining various phenomena.  The ending seems particularly rushed and the surprising twists are revealed so hastily they have almost no impact - by the time we know who's who and what's what, the book's already over.  Of course there are plenty of other books in the series, so maybe this story is just the beginning, but having read just this first volume, I would not be quick to recommend this book to science fiction fans.  Fantasy/adventure addicts should enjoy this book for Farmer's mastery of slam-bang action, but overall, it's really only a little better than average.	2001-12-29

Years have passed since Mutant Star, and Rick has spent this time living in the desert of America's Southwest, using his amazing powers to help ordinary people, and trying to atone for his father's death.  Over time he has accumulated a cadre of devoted followers, and formed the quasi-religious service organization  known as Better World.  Rick's twin brother Julian is worried that Rick can't handle the pressures of fame, power, and success, while the Mutant Council fears a backlash against all who possess psychic abilities.  Alanna is still trying to deal with her own frustrations, and finds solace in serving Rick, but finds him just as aloof as ever.  Is Rick's utopian vision  doomed to failure?  Can Julian and Alanna accept their new positions in Rick's life? Will sinister forces at work within the Mutant Council put an end to Better World forever?  Or will the non-mutant populace revolt against those who would manipulate their minds?<br />While less irritating than Mutant Star and more noteworthy than Mutant Prime, this book suffers from being rather slow.  The flashback structure eliminates any real suspense the story might have had, so while the narrator tediously describes each minor event that builds up to the climax, the reader, who already knows what's going to happen, may be anxious to get on with it.  A lot of space is devoted to Julian's ideological transformation, as might befit a novel of ideas; but instead of a clear discussion of the serious philosophical issues it raises, Haber gives us a star-crossed love story that ignores the very real objections one might have to allowing humanity to effectively become a subject race.<br />Certainly anyone who enjoyed the first three Mutant books should be happy enough with this conclusion; it has the same sharp characterizations leavened with internal turmoil and romantic sexuality, but readers who thought the original Mutant Season was 'just okay' won't find any great revelations that justify reading the whole series.who thought the original Mutant Season was 'just okay' won't find any great revelations that justify reading the whole series.	2001-12-12

The frame story is this: on a vast spaceship en route to colonize a planet in another star system, the civic leaders have gathered to discuss the question of how to educate the children of their ragtag crew.  These children will have no memory of Earth, no knowledge of life outside their vessel, and no experience of any social order other than that present on the ship.  As the debate transpires, the various leading citizens display their own biases, and recount stories that support (or refute) various intellectual positions that are espoused: stories that are drawn from their own personal experiences on Earth's colonies in the asteroid belt, the so-called Flying Mountains.  Some of these tales show men selfishly pursuing wealth and desire as in &quot;The Rogue&quot; and &quot;Ramble with a Gamblin' Man&quot;, but others feature characters who altruistically risk their lives to save their fellows as in &quot;Que Donn'rez Vous&quot;.  Still others, like &quot;Sunjammer&quot; and &quot;Recruiting Nation&quot; hinge on people who are simply doing their jobs.  As the tales progress, they tell the story of how mankind ceased to be bound to its single planet, but took possession of the entire solar system.<br />The whole debate about human values notwithstanding, these are essentially hard science 'puzzle' stories, where the reader is challenged to find a way out of a difficult situation given the limited resources available.  Many such stories were written during sci-fi's pulp era, and these are fairly representative of the type, but it can't be denied that Anderson telegraphs the solution to many of them far too quickly.  In short, they're really too simple to engage most adult readers.  Sound scientific principles are an important part of such stories, and in this regard Anderson does well, explaining what needs to be explained, while leavening each story with enough action and adventure to keep the reader's interest.  Character development is only hinted at, largely due to the work's structure, but the characters are at least par for this type of story.  Women fare better in these tales than in many examples of the type, holding positions of responsibility, even, in a genre where women are too often ignored altogether.<br />This book can safely be recommended to boys and girls in their early-to-middle teens who have modest experience with science fiction. There's no sexual content to speak of, but plenty of action, lots of realistic space adventure, and some not-too-difficult science to breeze through.  It's certainly easy enough reading and fairly fast-paced, and the philosophical discussion really isn't all that deep, so a good time can be had by all.

However, any adult readers who are used to dealing with serious moral issues, or expect radical new ideas, or hope to meet unforgettable characters, etc., needn't bother.	2001-11-18
US	49836087	R2F89Y8Q1A7UIT	0884119750	645287693	Mixed Men	Books	3	4	5	N	N	A light, intergalactic love story that young women may enjoy	Lady Gloria Laurr, Grand Captain of the Earth ship Star Cluster, is exploring the Greater Magellanic Cloud when she stumbles upon an outpost of the vast new empire that calls itself the Fifty Suns in this light, upbeat, intergalactic space opera. Settled by the outcast Dellians and their sympathizers long ago, the Fifty Suns hope to avoid outside interference by staying hidden, but how will that plan be received by the unreconciled Mixed Men - those of mixed Dellian and non-Dellian ancestry? Will they be content to maintain the status quo, or will they try to sell out to the Earth ship in hopes of gaining the equality and recognition they've so long been deprived of?<br />This book is certainly entertaining and fast-paced - almost too fast.  There are places where even major plot points are just glossed over for no obvious reason.  Only two characters are dealt with in any detail: Captain Laurr and Captain Peter Maltby, hereditary leader of the Mixed Men, and even these two aren't especially well rounded.  Maybe the biggest weakness is the lack of substance.  Instead of delving deeply into the sociological problems faced by men of mixed race, the emphasis is more on their (and specifically Maltby's) unusual psychic abilities.  In fact, the social order isn't really filled out to any great extent, which might lead one to believe that the real thrust of this novel is the romance that develops between the two main characters.  This, coupled with the presence of a very strong, independent, female protagonist, leads this reviewer to recommend this book for young women who enjoy far-flung science fiction romance.  Others may find this book enjoyable; it really isn't bad, but neither is it very memorable.	2001-10-14
US	49836087	R1CRKX7P9KVPWY	0345346041	136337176	Nine Tomorrows	Books	5	5	5	N	N	When humanity meets technology, Asimov is there	Sci-fi grandmaster Isaac Asimov is at the top of his game in this collection of nine short stories.  The first is &quot;Profession&quot;, which speculates on the nature of education in a future where the Earth is the technological center of a civilization of hundreds of populated planets.  The story revolves around young George Platen, and the very special profession for which he has been selected.  Asimov goes beyond describing the technology for imparting information and makes points about the everyman's preference for physical over social science, the nature of the creative mind, and how society finds<br />ways to placate the uncreative, including an event at the future Olympics. More menacing is the &quot;Feeling of Power&quot; in which an unassuming computer programmer discovers the lost art of arithmetic in a future society where only computers know how to do mathematics.  Asimov shows how this discovery moves up the bureaucratic chain until it reaches the ears of those who know<br />how to make use of it, but also makes a statement about scientific responsibility.  &quot;The Gentle Vultures&quot; shows a non-competitive race that goes from planet to planet helping the survivors of nuclear catastrophe - until they encounter their first Cold War.  And two of the very best tales deal with the burgeoning concept of artificial intelligence.  &quot;All the<br />Troubles of the World&quot; shows a society that relies too heavily on its guiding computer, while &quot;The Last Question&quot; is a totally unique story dealing with a theosophical question and featuring a conclusion that is perhaps the greatest in all science fiction.<br />Although most of the stories were written in the 1950's, there's very little that's been dated by subsequent scientific discoveries, largely because this collection isn't about hard science so much as the relationships between far-reaching technologies and human society.  The protagonists aren't<br />swashbuckling hero types, and they usually aren't even dedicated scientists single-mindedly pursuing knowledge; they're more likely to be &quot;little guys&quot;, ordinary working people with jobs to do, who when faced with something they should be helpless to combat, still summon up the courage to act during that one brief moment when they can make a crucial difference.  Probably the most dated feature of this collection is its attitude toward women, who are frequently absent entirely, or serve only in the most stereotypical of roles.  Only the touchingly sentimental &quot;The Ugly Little Boy&quot; treats a woman as anything like a real human being.  Even so, the power of Asimov's ideas<br />and the scope of his vision of the future have delighted readers for over half a century.  If you haven't read these stories in other collections, you'll certainly want to catch them here.ren't even dedicated scientists single-mindedly pursuing knowledge; they're more likely to be &quot;little guys&quot;, ordinary working people with jobs to do, who when faced with something they should be helpless to combat, still summon up the courage to act during that one brief moment when they can make a crucial difference.

Clarke, but as the title suggests, at least this one is focused squarely on a topic sure to capture the attention of his loyal fan base.  There are no new entries here; this is more like a greatest hits collection culled from his many previous books of essays, but this volume avoids some of the flaws of those earlier publications (repetitiveness and lack of focus), and stands as a forthright, though still modest, work.<br />&quot;Memoirs of an Armchair Astronaut (Retired)&quot; discusses the early days of the British Interplanetary Society and sets up Clarke's unique qualifications as an authority on Space and Space flight.  This piece captures the spirit of fun and adventure that is missing from more dated articles on particular achievements of the U.S. space program such as &quot;The First Scouts&quot; and &quot;Appointment with Mars&quot;.  Those readers who are interested in learning about Space but haven't been keeping up might be interested in factual science pieces like &quot;The Winds of Space&quot;, which discusses solar wind, and &quot;Time for the Stars&quot; which describes how time will be kept on other planets of the solar system, but given the pace of advancement in space science, many readers would probably rather see discussions of more recent developments.<br />The real reason for reading Clarke is, of course, his boundless imagination, and the best entries are those where he lets it roam free.  &quot;The Solar Century&quot; catalogues the planets and the obstacles to human settlement of same, along with some possible solutions.  &quot;The Shores of Infinity&quot; takes a hard look at the possibility of interstellar travel, while &quot;When the Aliens Come&quot; considers different scenarios involving contact with extraterrestrial life.  No Clarke book is complete without his trademark sense of humor, and it comes through at its most dryly ironic in &quot;The Meddlers&quot;, &quot;Report on Planet Three&quot;, and the more personal &quot;Dear Sir...&quot;.<br />Essays of the scientific kind appeal only to a very narrow audience, especially once they've passed their expiration date.  While Clarke's imagination and humor often take these pieces beyond that vein, they still don't compare to his science fiction.  So while this book is superior to Clarke's other collections, it still doesn't really merit a recommendation.s&quot;, &quot;Report on Planet Three&quot;, and the more personal &quot;Dear Sir...&quot;.<br />Essays of the scientific kind appeal only to a very narrow audience, especially once they've passed their expiration date.

The melting of the polar ice cap will have flooded low-lying cities and initiated a cycle of climatic changes that mankind's technology will be unable to break.  As a result, most of the U.S. will be covered by desert, pollution will make the air almost unbreathable, and ozone depletion will make even the sun dangerous.  These are simple facts of everyday life in this compelling novel of intrigue by sci-fi master Robert Silverberg.<br />Amidst numerous twists and turns, the story focuses on a plot to overthrow the ruling government of the artificial satellite world called Valparaiso Nuevo.  A shadowy figure known as the Generalissimo runs this environmental paradise as a safe haven for any who can pay for its protection.  But no one can foresee the catastrophic effects of the actions of a tiny group of men who plan to oust the Generalissimo for their own selfish purposes.<br />Paul Carpenter is the most sympathetic of these characters, a salaryman who takes a position as a sea captain in his eternal quest for promotion in the Japanese megacorporation that controls half the world's business and industry.  His fortunes decline dramatically after a mutiny on the high seas leaves him unemployable.  His childhood friend, Nick Rhodes, a brilliant geneticist who is collapsing under the weight of his own ethical dilemma, introduces him to an acquaintance of his driven, opinionated girlfriend Isabelle, the seductive Jolanda.  A talented sculptor and even more talented lover, Jolanda is the lynch pin of a plot that includes Enron, an Israeli spy, and Farkus, a genetically altered agent of a rival corporation.  Together, their greed, suspicion, ambition, stupidity, and insatiable lust lead to a dramatic conclusion that stands as a brilliant metaphor for the destruction man has wreaked upon his own planet.<br />This novel features powerful, realistic characters, crushing descriptions of a ravaged earth, and a series of intense situations.  Silverberg warns us that our  present day course will shortly lead us to a time and place where tough decisions will routinely have to made, and their often tragic consequences accepted, simply because no better alternatives are available.  The science is carefuly thought out, but includes plenty of radical surprises as well. This is a fine selection for all fans of science fiction, and a must for those who are interested in how incremental ecological changes can have enormous effects on our future.iptions of a ravaged earth, and a series of intense situations.

US	49836087	R2HNYJCN7KKOGB	0812523970	468309604	Traitor To The Living	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Great idea, good story, terrible ending	Society is transformed by a device that allows communication with the souls of the dead in this science fiction/detective thriller by Phil Farmer. The so-called &quot;Medium&quot; is putatively the invention of entrepreneur Raymond Western, who has become extremely wealthy by guarding the secret of Medium's design, and charging exorbitant prices for its unique services. There are many skeptics, of course, especially in the religious and scientific communities, and one of the leaders of the opposition is Gordon Carfax, a hard-boiled private detective-turned-history professor who, for reasons of his own, suspects that the forces contacted through Medium might be something other than what is advertised. He is contacted by a beautiful young woman who claims that her deceased father was the real inventor of Medium, and the two set off on a desperate attempt to find the truth about what Medium is and who really developed it, before Western's men can silence them.<br />Farmer balances this far-out plot (the unlikely technological development of after-death communication is only the beginning) with down-to-earth characters whose actions display a day-to-day ordinariness and sometimes gritty realism that lends some much needed credibility. The story features sufficient action and plenty of wild new revelations to keep up the reader's interest, and surely fans of Farmer and the sci-fi/detective sub-genre will have fun reading this suspenseful novel.<br />On the down side, the ending is bitterly disappointing, and pretty much ruined the book for this reviewer. While Farmer's conclusion leaves the reader with some things to think about, the book neatly avoids most of the theosophical issues that a writer like Heinlein, say, would have mined 24-carat gold from. Perhaps what Farmer needs to do is sit down and write a good sequel, picking up from this book's clever, portentous, but thoroughly unsatisfying conclusion, and bringing the story to the kind of resolution that readers of this book deserve.

US	49836087	R3KDYKM3PRL5YN	055329492X	730674789	MUTANT STAR	Books	3	5	6	N	N	New, brattier Mutants recycle the same old plot	Volume three of the four volume Mutant Saga opens 25 years after the events of Mutant Prime.  Many of the characters from the first two books are still here, but they're overshadowed by their children and really don't have much impact in this story.  But without the background from Mutant Season, the entire concept of an insular strain of esp-powered mutants would probably be very confusing, as would the complex family relationships.  This time around, the focus is on Melanie's twins, Julian and Rick.  Julian is the good son, mutant-powered, engaged in a scientific study to see if the mutants' mental flares can be used to predict the future, and simultaneously trying to make time with his brilliant but older boss, Eva.  Rick is the wild and angry son, possessing none of the precious mutant powers.  Reckless and irresponsible, his relationship with Skerry and Narlydda's daughter Alanna is the core of this book.<br />As the Mutant Saga switches to the next generation, the overall story seems to run out of steam just a bit.  The plot of Star is really very similar to that of Prime, and one wonders how much it would have hurt the larger work if one of these novels had never been published.  Certainly Haber has a real gift with characterization, and that carries these books despite their weaknesses, but by virtually ignoring the characters from the previous volumes and featuring their children instead, Haber loses the benefit of our long-term emotional investment. Readers who have grown to care about Michael and Kelly may find themselves indifferent or worse to the spoiled brats who star in this novel.  Couple this with a plot that doesn't so much climax as kind of fizzle out, and we have what is surely the weakest book of the series (so far).  One can only hope that the final volume, Mutant Legacy, will punch up some of the lamer plot points and feature enough new ideas to bring the series back up to the high level of Mutant Season once again.	2001-09-15

Pohl shakes up the common conceptions of the man known to the world as Christopher Columbus in this biography, published in 1986.  If you haven't studied Columbus since this time, you may not know Columbus at all.<br />Pohl submits that the man who sailed under the name Christopher Columbus was born Juan Colon on the island of Majorca, son of a Jewish mother and an absent, dispossessed nobleman.  As a result, Colon spent his life seeking the kind of power that had been denied the father he never knew.  Convinced that finding a shorter trade route to India would mean wealth and power to its discoverer, Colon began a long public relations campaign to thus cash in on his abilities as navigator and ship's captain.  Unable to get the Portugese to finance his expedition, he was forced to turn to Ferdinand and Isabel of Spain, but, since his family was still outlawed from a failed revolt years earlier, he was forced to assume the identity of a Genoese merchant whom he knew had died at sea: Cristoforo Colombo.  Pohl describes Colon's career in fascinating detail, including all of the so-called voyages of discovery, and even goes into the successes of Americo Vespucci at some length.<br />While it is not this reviewer's intention to pass critical judgement on Pohl's scholarship, the very outrageousness of some of these claims inclines one to wonder about their veracity.  The notes at the end of the book clearly show that there are and always have been many unanswered questions about Columbus, and the net effect of this book may be more confusing (and sensationalist) than enlightening.  The first couple of chapters weren't particularly good; the story was disjointed and episodic, and the positioning of the maps further on in the book, combined with the subject's unfamiliar name, make this section disconcertingly cryptic: &quot;Where is Majorca?  Who is this Juan Colon?  Where in blazes is Castile?  Why aren't we talking about Columbus?&quot;  While the solutions to these questions are eventually presented (in one form or another) Pohl should probably have been more forthright from the beginning instead of trying to spring surprises on his readers.  After all, this book is being read in a country where three out of ten students can't find Canada on a map, let alone Navarre.  All this aside, Pohl presents us with an entertaining account of one man's extraordinary life in relatively simple, straight-forward language.  If you're interested in this period of history, and you're ready for a radically different viewpoint on this famous explorer, Pohl's book is worth discovering.solutions to these questions are eventually presented (in one form or another) Pohl should probably have been more forthright from the beginning instead of trying to spring surprises on his readers.

US	49836087	R3TEAXD1X9MBH	0385266480	25617855	The Mutant Prime	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Mutants II has good characters, more focus, human touch	This book is the second volume of the Mutant saga begun in The Mutant Season, which Haber wrote with her husband, sci-fi master Robert Silverberg.  One should really read Season first, because it not only introduces the various members of the Ryton family (who are featured in both books), but it also sets up the whole concept of the Mutant race, their somewhat precarious position in society, the powers they possess over &quot;normals&quot;, and the idea of the supermutant, with a depth that Prime does not.<br />In the fifteen years since the events of Season, the tele-powered Mutant race has made substantial social gains, although the Mutant community still remembers the repressions of past times and always fears a resurgence of anti-Mutant hysteria.  This concern is brought to the forefront by the appearance of one Victor Ashman, a mutant of unknown origins and ambitions who possesses powers far beyond what any of the Mutant race has demonstrated.  Under the protection of a wealthy dowager, Ashman claims his rightful place as leader of the Mutant community while making a prisoner of a famous but reclusive artist named Narlydda.  Meanwhile, Michael Ryton is facing investigation by an agency anxious to blame his father's company for a disaster that took place on the Moon.  Will Michael's troubles draw him closer to his self-involved wife, or drive him into the arms of his old flame, the &quot;normal&quot; Kelly?  What plans does Ashman have for Narlydda, and can Michael's cousin Skerry hope to rescue her despite his frightful powers?<br />While continuing the saga of the Ryton family, Haber has presented a more focused story here than in The Mutant Season, which seemed to pursue too many subplots at once.  Also, while there's still substantial emphasis on characterization, the characters are more grown up than they were in the first volume, so the whole work is more action-oriented and less like a &quot;Mutants 90210&quot;.  So while still not a towering achievement, this is an enjoyable, fast-paced, page-turner of a sci-fi fantasy, with an extra human touch.t, this is an enjoyable, fast-paced, page-turner of a sci-fi fantasy, with an extra human touch.	2001-08-23

If you're already a fan, this volume contains several favorites.  If you aren't familiar with the Master's work, this is probably as good a place as any to start.<br />&quot;Thunder and Roses&quot; takes place after a devastating nuclear first strike, and features a beautiful entertainer's plea to prevent a terrible retaliation.  The survivors' despair is movingly portrayed, but doesn't get in the way of the story's main point: can mutual destruction be justified in the context of basic human values?  &quot;The Golden Helix&quot; shows a space expedition marooned on an unknown planet learning that despite their trials, life manages to go on.  In &quot;Mr. Costello, Hero&quot; a smooth talking blackmailer sells his snake oil to a burgeoning society, while in &quot;The Skills of Xanadu&quot; an arrogant scout who dreams of conquest is baffled by the simple folk of edenic Xanadu.<br />Some of the longer tales are less to this reviewer's liking: &quot;Killdozer!&quot; features lots of action and focuses on the technical aspects of heavy machinery at the expense of clever plotting and ideas, while &quot;The [Widget], the [Wadget], and Boff&quot; loses its momentum by following the various residents of the boardinghouse and their subplots instead of advancing the (rather weak) main story.  Still, neither piece is completely without entertainment value.<br />Women are often in danger in Sturgeon's stories, but at least they aren't ignored altogether as is too often the case with classic sci-fi.  And there are several stories, including &quot;The Sex of Opposite&quot; and &quot;Slow Sculpture&quot;, where a woman shares the lead with a man.  Best of all, &quot;Bright Segment&quot;, which shows a lonely man trying to care for a wounded stranger, and the monologue of &quot;The Man Who Lost the Sea&quot; feature not only completely unexpected endings (reminiscent of O. Henry), but also a searing emotional intensity that almost seems to transcend the genre.

Unable to control the myriad external thoughts and personalities that flow into his consciousness, the constant influx of telepathic information leaves him in an autistic state, from which he only very rarely awakens.  His therapist, Lydia, herself a telepath, seems to have some limited success in helping Dennis filter out the powerful minds whose thoughts span across time and distance. After acquiring, (and eventually dispelling) the personalities of a number of strong-minded individuals (including some famous ones), Dennis finally grows up to realize his purpose on Earth - to serve the mysterious stranger called The Dark Man in his fight against alien invaders.  Peculiarly, Zelazny doesn't tell us much about the invaders, except that they are secretly manipulating mankind into turning the world into the kind of post-industrial wasteland that is their natural habitat, and they don't even appear in the novel until the very end.  A smattering of interludes where we get to see the invaders at work might have made this novel more entertaining, although admittedly it might also have been a little too confusing in this already convoluted story.<br />The most interesting sections are in the middle, where Dennis' young mind is repeatedly being taken over by the thoughts of others, although while reading it, it's very difficult to see exactly where this unusual story is headed, and that can make the reader feel that the plot is progressing rather slowly, or, one might even suspect, not really progressing at all, but merely delaying the ending.  Some of the personalities are just fragments, and many of them only last a few pages before being put to rest and then dropped from the story altogether, having served no real purpose except to show how utterly bewildering Dennis' situation is.  Fortunately, there are also some gripping chase sequences that shake up the otherwise very cerebral story. As is too often typical of Zelazny's novels, the book feels like a short story that dragged on past its ideal length.  The conclusion seems a little too pat and too simple, and too abrupt after the long and elaborate buildup (spanning the Earth, Luna, and also several millennia), but that doesn't keep this book from being a fascinating read.  Rabid proponents of environmentalism might find this story particularly to their liking.e gripping chase sequences that shake up the otherwise very cerebral story.

Ostensibly hidden from the rest of humanity for centuries, the race of golden-eyed espers has finally chosen to reveal themselves.  The story picks up several decades later, after the initial years of unrest and persecution have subsided somewhat; and while legal protections exist, prejudice against the mutants is still very strong in a populace that both envies and fears them.  Against this backdrop Haber tells the story of one very active mutant family, the Rytons, and one &quot;normal&quot;, Andie Greenberg, chief assistant to the only mutant Senator.<br />If you can swallow the outlandish premise (for which Silverberg must accept responsibility) Haber has written a fairly entertaining novel.  The basic technique is a long series of short scenes from each of several subplots, some of which converge, and others of which will presumably be picked up later in the series, but which together paint a fairly credible portrait of life in a world with Mutants.  The real strength of this book is the characterizations, which reflect a familiar variety of reactions to racial prejudice, but also show that life is pretty much the same even with telepathic or telekinetic powers.  Young Michael Ryton struggles against his domineering father's conservative insularism, while his &quot;null&quot; sister Melanie feels ignored and uncared-for, and their cousin Skerry is<br />unattached, uncontrollable, and undependable.  Andie Greenberg is the only normal who is followed closely, but in the end she proves to be the real hero, providing the key to defusing the crisis that evolves when the mutant Senator pushes for sweeping changes in mutant's rights.<br />While the round robin plot structure keeps the reader  interested, there are spots where the plot advances very slowly.  There are engaging characters of both sexes, but so much of the focus is on young people that boyfriends and girlfriends and sexual encounters and adolescent angst seem to fill most of the book.  As a result, some adult readers might find this material difficult to relate to, while the fairly explicit sexuality makes it inappropriate for young readers.  Young women interested in sci-fi fantasy should find this book especially appealing; the rest of us can hope that the next book in the series will be a little more grown up.hat boyfriends and girlfriends and sexual encounters and adolescent angst seem to fill most of the book.

One of the world's most original and sensitive storytellers, he will be solely missed.<br />&quot;Under the Jaguar Sun&quot; presents a married couple whose vacation in Mexico is punctuated by the powerful flavors of the local cuisine.  Before the trip is over they discover that the spicy food whets their appetite for passion as well as for dining.  In &quot;A King Listens&quot; the proud ruler, constrained by the obligations and dangers of his office, finds his only real source of information is his hearing.  The ambient sounds of his palace, and the voices inside his own head are all that he can depend on.  Finally, &quot;The Name, the Nose&quot; shows us a collage of desperate swains trying to seek out a woman whom they can identify only by her fragrance.  As in &quot;Jaguar&quot; Calvino touches on the relationship between the senses and sexual desire, but this tale also carries a different message - one that seems to hint darkly at the author's own coming demise.<br />For those unfamiliar with the work of this master of postmodern literature, these three stories are probably not the best introduction.  The quiet intensity of Calvino's voice is there, and his style is as pristine as ever, almost a prose poetry; but while the stories feature at least a couple of genuine surprises, they fall short of the knockout power that distinguishes his very best work.  By focusing so strongly on the senses, he underplays what are probably his greatest strengths - in-depth logical analysis and exquisitely ironic humor.  Fans will surely appreciate one last opportunity to experience Calvino's skill, but others should probably start with one of his more revolutionary works if they want to see why he is so greatly admired.	2001-08-14

The real standout is the title story, &quot;True Names&quot;, a uniquely imaginative piece that cleverly combines the magical conflict of the swords and sorcery genre with modern high-tech computers.  In the world of the not too distant future, virtual reality technology has completely replaced contemporary operating systems so that talented computer hackers can virtually live in a pseudo-magical realm called the Other Plane.  The very best are effectively sorcerers who can mold their reality in any way imaginable, at least until they break the connection and return to the real world.  In order to avoid reprisals, they only need protect the secret of their true names.  Against this backdrop, a brilliant sorcerer is recruited to hunt out the mysterious new destructive force known as the Mailman, who seems to be using the computer realm to gain power in the real world.  But in a universe where nothing is as it seems, how can he tell who are his friends and who are his enemies?  This is a fascinating piece of speculation that seems more and more plausible every day.<br />The other strong entries are &quot;Bookworm, Run!&quot; which features a chimpanzee whose mind has been experimentally augmented with a computer hookup, and &quot;The Ungoverned&quot; which shows private security agents trying to fend off an invasion in a United States that has been decimated by nuclear war. &quot;Bookworm&quot; is primarily a long chase, as the terrified chimp tried to escape his captors before they can punish him for the terrible crime he's committed, while &quot;The Ungoverned&quot; covers one key battle of a potentially major war.  Both stories are heavy on action and excitement, but present some interesting ideas as well.  Less successful are &quot;The Peddler's Apprentice&quot;, in which a traveling salesman sets an angry young man on the path to greatness, and the tedious &quot;Long Shot&quot;, which seems little more than a setup for the clever ending.<br />These stories are fast, easy reading with plenty of action, and should be eminently suitable for younger readers, but adult fans of science fiction will also find this a superb collection.ong Shot&quot;, which seems little more than a setup for the clever ending.<br />These stories are fast, easy reading with plenty of action, and should be eminently suitable for younger readers, but adult fans of science fiction will also find this a superb collection.	2001-08-03
US	49836087	R4ALOGLHQ1960	0345330145	428889418	Puppet Masters	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Heinlein's Alien Invasion Features Action, Adventure, No Sex	This fast-paced action-packed adventure is a sparkling example of Heinlein's early post-juvenile output.  As such, there's virtually none of the sexual obsession, social commentary and philosophical maundering that some find so offensive, although fans of his later work may find this book low on substance.<br />The characters are pretty good (for sci-fi, anyway), and their relationship goes through some development before they fall for each other, plus their bantering conversation is a substantial improvement over the dialogue in most genre fiction. Of course the plot is straight out of H.G. Wells, as an alien race invades the earth and only a secret organization of government agents can act against them.  The real strength of this novel is the breezy reality Heinlein brings to his story, and the clever (and all too believable) means the slugs use to control the country without the general populace ever knowing the difference.  Surely this is Heinlein's interpretation of the Communist witch hunts of the twenties and fifties, when even someone you thought you knew well could prove to be a deadly enemy.  The horror element should probably not be overemphasized, although this book was surely much scarier forty years ago.  The whole concept of having an inhuman thing hanging on your back and controlling your every action is perhaps more creepy than grisly, and may not impress too many modern readers, but this particular reader found it quite disturbing enough, thank you.<br />Demonstrating a command of technique largely absent from his later novels, Heinlein's tightly controlled point of view puts the action right in your face, and keeps the reader in sympathy with the hero throughout.  This is an excellent book for younger readers, even though it's not aimed at them specifically, and it's also a top choice for fans of sci-fi escapism; just don't expect it to change your life.	2001-08-02
US	49836087	R1E32A0JYLLQXJ	042507059X	924344296	More Magic	Books	3	2	2	N	N	No New Breakthroughs, Just More of the Same	This book continues in the vein of the magical mythos originally devised by sci-fi master Larry Niven.  Niven's concept is that centuries ago, magic was a rare but available technology, requiring substantial training for its initiates, and dependent on the presence of mana, an intangible, but nonrenewable natural resource.  As all the mana in an area was used up, magicians simply moved on, until the time when there was no mana left anywhere and the secrets of practicing magic became meaningless lore. Against this backdrop, we are presented with four stories of the days when magic was dwindling, but still alive.<br />In Niven's &quot;The Lion in the Attic&quot; the last standing tower of the lost continent of Atlantis is converted into a restaurant by its jovial innkeeper.  Mysterious visitors from a far land mingle with a confusing mix of mer-people, but the shifting point of view makes it difficult to know whom to side with.  As is too typical of Niven's fantasy, the climax is quite clever, but the reader isn't sufficiently involved with the characters to care either way.  In Bob Shaw's &quot;Shadow of Wings&quot; a troubled visionary uses a beautiful woman to recruit a reclusive magician.  His plan: to assassinate the land's popular ruler before the passage of time turns him into an insatiable tyrant.  The ironic twist at the end is amusing, but the story itself is no better than average.  Rather better is the engaging &quot;Talisman&quot;, in which a beautiful young thief and a wandering magician search for a legendary treasure.  What keeps this story crackling is the way the more sympathetic character of the thief is continually trying to outwit the power of the magician, and how she subverts his attempts to retain control over her.  The even-handedness of the conclusion should delight readers of both sexes.  In &quot;Mana from Heaven&quot;, Roger Zelazny shows a modern day sorcerer locked in a deadly struggle with an unknown adversary.  Amusing an idea as it is, the modernization doesn't really accomplish anything because Zelazny doesn't choose to tell a particularly timely story.  This showdown between magicians could just as easily have happened in the past, and would have if Zelazny hadn't wanted to point out some plans for the future. Still, this isn't a bad story; it just leaves one wishing that it been better integrated into the here and now, else why bother?<br />Readers who enjoyed Niven's other 'magic' books will certainly enjoy this one - it's pretty much more of the same - the same kinds of personalities, the same kinds of locales, the same easy sexual conquests, and maybe even a little less emphasis on the technological aspects of spell-casting, but science fiction fans who appreciated the technological approach to magic first displayed in &quot;Time of the Warlock&quot; will find little of interest here., the modernization doesn't really accomplish anything because Zelazny doesn't choose to tell a particularly timely story.

US	49836087	R1WVOGQ6WUACJL	0884118479	809103570	Threads of Time	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Spinrad's 'Torch' saves a weak, depressing collection	The premise behind this volume is to present three novellas, a form not usually anthologized, by three important science fiction writers.  The title is actually a bit misleading, since these stories don't focus very much on the theme of time.  Instead, the common thread is one of secrecy.  Each story features a secret that a select group is keeping from society as a whole.  How these secrets are exposed tells us a great deal about how the authors see the foibles of the human race.<br />In Gregory Benford's &quot;Threads of Time&quot; an increasingly powerful religious group called the 'New Sons' hopes to keep an astonishing discovery from the public.  The heroines's narrow escapes on the Moon are very effectively portrayed, but this reviewer found the ultimate resolution plain depressing, with little trace of any redemption for humanity, a criticism that has been leveled at Benford before.  Clifford Simak's &quot;The Marathon Photograph&quot; is lighter, almost folksy at points, which undercuts any meaningful impression he may have wanted to create.  The tale revolves around a secret lodge tucked away in the hills far from civilization, and the unfortunate death of its caretaker, an event that sets off a series of absurd co-incidences, the worst offense being that the photograph is discovered by the one person in the world who would recognize its significance.  Even apart from that, the story doesn't really hang together very well.  Simak puts plenty of wild gadgets and interesting ideas into this story, but doesn't take the time to develop them fully or even integrate them very well.  There isn't enough focus to create the one specific effect that the ending calls for, and the story falls rather flat despite its revelations.  Norman Spinrad's &quot;Ride the Torch&quot; is very good, easily the best of the three, although one wishes that the ending (with God and Satan arguing) wasn't quite so cheesy.  But prior to that Spinrad tells a good story, quickly sketching the unique social arrangement, getting us interested in the main character, throwing in lots of futuristic technology and effects, and managing to remain upbeat despite the most dire of circumstances humanity could possibly face: being trapped in space with nowhere to go.<br />If you pick up this book, read Benford's story when you're mad at the world - his cynicism should suit your mood perfectly.  Simak's story can be read any time; its scrambled intentions probably won't have much impact either way.  But save the Spinrad tale for when you have the time to savor it. It's not quite top-notch, but it's almost enough to make this collection worth while.he unique social arrangement, getting us interested in the main character, throwing in lots of futuristic technology and effects, and managing to remain upbeat despite the most dire of circumstances humanity could possibly face: being trapped in space with nowhere to go.<br />If you pick up this book, read Benford's story when you're mad at the world - his cynicism should suit your mood perfectly.

The biggest surprise is the long chapter of essays on subjects literary, including some comments on Olaf Stapledon's Last and First Men, a reminiscence about George Bernard Shaw, and an essay on how Space is described in English poetry.  Unfortunately, much of this section is devoted to forwards written for books that the average science fiction fan will never read, so that while this chapter is at least different, it's may not be of much interest to those legions of fans of Clarke's fiction who would be most likely to read this book.<br />The rest of this volume is more in line with other collections of essays Clarke has published, and suffers from most of the same weaknesses.  For one thing, the level of repetition in these pieces gets tedious rather quickly, as a long series of articles describe the advantages of and history behind Clarke's main obsession of the period, a satellite-based system for surveillance of the earth's surface.  Another point that is hammered home repeatedly is the predicted development of &quot;electronic tutors&quot;: imagine a Game Boy except that instead of having fun with it, you learn from it.  Of course this book was published before the personal computer revolution, so Clarke can be forgiven for not realizing that kids would know when a program was trying to teach them something, and quickly move on to something more entertaining.  This is not to say that Clarke was wrong about the use of electronics for teaching, but rather that the development of machines whose sole function was teaching was unnecessary - modern PC's being versatile enough to be used for any number of purposes - but then, who among us was smart enough to foresee that?<br />Perhaps the best piece in the book is the entry detailing Clarke's (then) recent trip to the Soviet Union, coyly titled &quot;To Russia, with Love...&quot; and featuring the pacing, personalities, and ideas that make his fiction so interesting, but there is little else in the book this good.  The weakest group of essays is on the subject that should be Clarke's strength - Space and Space travel.  Most of this section had a decidedly historical bent to it to begin with, and the passage of another 17 years has only exacerbated the problem.  Collections like this one may be interesting enough while they're still current, but too much of this material is either dated or completely unscientific.itled &quot;To Russia, with Love...&quot; and featuring the pacing, personalities, and ideas that make his fiction so interesting, but there is little else in the book this good.

Imagine a society in which sexual frustration and jealousy and psychological hang-ups have all been eliminated by happiness drugs and universal sexual availability.  Imagine that everyone sees all life as God's blessing and success is judged by how many children you've produced.  Welcome to Robert Silverberg's Urban Monolith, a thousand-story building that houses 800,000 of Earth's 75 billion people.<br />Silverberg presents his ostensibly utopian future through the Faulknerian technique of dramatizing just a few seemingly random episodes in the lives of a small, but representative grouping of loosely interwoven characters. The story opens as a social scientist revels in the joy of a perfectly ordinary morning.  The young man who slept with his wife is still there, an immediate indication of the sexual freedom that compensates residents for the total lack of privacy they must accept as part of the overcrowding. The young man is Siegmund Klumer, an up and coming 14 year old, who seems destined to become one of the Urbmon's leaders, and the novel is essentially his story, told indirectly by people who know, or respect, or at least share sexual partners, with him.  But the real star of this show is the society itself, and the insidious way it provides for the needs of thousands of people, even while robbing them of their essential humanity.<br />As the story moves from one character to another, we are introduced to such marvels as automated child-care, futuristic rock concerts, and pleasure-giving drugs, but we also gradually begin to see the cracks in the façade of utopian perfection, and the terrible price the residents sometimes pay.  Universal sexual availability helps drain off frustrations and aggression, but sex quickly becomes monotonous, meaningless, and emotionally unfulfilling.  The drug-induced highs lead to inevitable comedowns, marital fidelity is socially unacceptable, and personal freedom has more limits than at first appears.  People mature early, in their early teens, and begin working, having sex, and producing children as soon as possible.  Of course such a close-knit society must have order, and since no one is ever alone, it follows that someone is always watching. Variation from accepted behavior is viewed by the authorities as threatening, and the punishment is always either re-education or death.  And as with any controlled society, all social institutions are geared toward convincing people that they are happy, even though there are many more unhappy people than is commonly admitted.<br />This is a finely crafted book, with its subtle characterization, carefully integrated social milieu, and bold yet understated technique.  The late 60's influence of hedonistic sexuality and drug taking makes this book unsuitable for younger readers, but it is not so shocking as to be offensive to most adults.  Most of all, Silverberg sends a potent warning that over-population, short sighted thinking, and rampant pleasure seeking all make a populace vulnerable to authoritarianism - a warning that looms just as tall today as it did 30 years ago.first appears.

Farmer pulls out all the stops, creating a whole new &quot;utopian&quot; social order, truly shocking sexual mores (even for those who thought they couldn't be shocked by anything), and, like Joyce, a richer and more complex language with which to express it all. Chaotic, but carefully structured, the story describes a couple of crucial days in the lives of a handsome but troubled young artist and his eccentric grandfather.  Extraordinary as this work is, it certainly isn't for everyone, especially those who are easily offended.  Furthermore, the society described in this story is a confusing one at best, and the linguistic experimentation only makes it more difficult to follow what's going on.  The story's prologue, &quot;The Oogenesis of Bird City&quot;, is no more readily comprehensible, and considerably less fun.<br />The long short story &quot;Spiders of the Purple Mage&quot; is a fantasy about magic, and how a tenacious but seemingly ordinary woman named Masha helps defeat a feared magician.  It bears no relationship to the previous story except for the title, and while this is a pretty good story as such fantasies go, there's nothing really remarkable about it.  &quot;The Long Wet Purple Dream of Rip Van Winkle&quot; is a trashy send up of Rip visiting the 20th Century.  Most notable is Rip's turn as a late-sixties hippie, where his exceptional sexual endowment makes him an immediate favorite.  &quot;The Making of Revelation, Part I&quot; is a short (but not short enough) story that shows God hiring Cecil B. DeMille to film the Apocalypse and is every bit as  sacrilegiously funny as &quot;Riders&quot; is, but without any redeeming social or human values.<br />As collections go, these stories don't really hang together very well. &quot;Spiders&quot; in particular, isn't humorous, sexy, or heretical, and was obviously included solely because of the title.  Still, &quot;Riders of the Purple Wage&quot; is a science fiction classic that shouldn't be missed by those able to handle its brutal sexuality, chaotic violence, and philosophical pontification.

The story revolves around one Franz Westen, recovering alcoholic and horror writer, whose fascination with the steep, solitary hill called Corona Heights leads him into the creepy world of Thibault de Castries, an eccentric mystic. Anarchist, founder of a secret order, and theorizer of the dreaded paramental entities, de Castries' power has touched the lives of many of San Francisco's most illustrious citizens.  Can Franz somehow keep from being drawn into its tantalizing maw?<br />Leiber does an excellent job of migrating Lovecraft's growing disquiet to mid-twentieth century urban angst, theorizing the existence of dark forces that draw their power from the mass aggregations of metal, electricity and lost humanity that compose our great cities.  Still, it's difficult to keep an air of suspense for any great length of time, and much of this book is just a slow buildup without very much tension.  Leiber has too much good material here for a short story, but as it stands, the novel could have been cut by 50 pages or more without much loss.  For example, the protagonist's friends Gunnar and Saul, who appear in so many scenes, don't do anything and really have no function, while the romantic interest, the intellectual Calpurnia, is usually absent despite the critical role she  plays.<br />If you're a big fan of Lovecraft, give this review an extra star - you'll really enjoy Leiber's new take on some classic themes.  Add another if you're really into San Francisco's geography and/or literary history, because this book has lots of both.  So if you find that you fit the fairly narrow target audience this book seems to have been written for, you'll probably love this novel.  This reviewer didn't.	2001-06-30
US	49836087	R1KUE3S87LG3OU	1857989023	779976632	Hegira	Books	3	14	17	N	N	Good characters, good setting, but not much happening	This sci-fi fantasy by Greg Bear makes for good enough escapist reading, but while it's fairly entertaining and imaginative, it really has nothing else to recommend it.  As the title suggests, the story follows three men on an extended trek across a vast planet, not so subtly named \\"Hegira\\".  One of the main plot threads focuses on the question of what they're searching for, and what they'll do when they find it, but the payoff doesn't nearly live up to the long journey that precedes it.  Bear creates an interesting geography, and a couple of mildly interesting social orders, but there really isn't much that could be called new.  There's very little science, and the more creative ideas aren't really explained very well and come off as mere fantasies.  Younger readers (say, mid-teens) should find this novel a quick, easy read, and may be intrigued by its imaginative setting, but it's doubtful that they'll understand the story's resolution any better than this reviewer did.  This book's greatest strength is that the main characters are fairly well drawn (at least for a science fiction/fantasy) - Bar-Woten fleeing from his murderous past, Barthel worshipfully following Bar-Woten, and Kiril searching for his soul mate - but it's a pity Bear didn't find better use for them than simply journeying across this enormous planet.  Another weak point is the treatment of female characters.  Few as they are, they function entirely as objects of male desire, and seem to have no will or even life of their own: not exactly a useful lesson for young minds.  In summary, some good characterizations and a fairly interesting setting simply aren't enough to carry this novel all by themselves; there's too little conflict, too little action, and too little plot.  Perhaps no one will hate this novel, but it's hard to believe anyone will really love it, either.	2001-06-19

For all its episodic construction (unavoidable, considering the unparalleled scope) and its rather flat, exclusively male characters, the Foundation Trilogy takes readers back to a time when America was making the world safe for democracy, personal freedoms were a given, and science seemed to be the salvation of a fallible humanity.<br />The first volume, Foundation, sets up the whole idea of the Seldon Plan, a mathematically based view of sociopolitical forces that enables one brilliant scientist to mold a new galactic empire from a foundation of one hundred thousand scientists and their families.  After the introduction, whose final paragraphs subtly lay out the whole structure without our knowing it, we get to see the Plan in action as the Foundation faces a series of political and military crises.  Because the scientist/hero is long dead before the second chapter, the heroes are the political and economic, rather than scientific, leaders who must resist the temptation to take direct military action, and instead allow events to proceed until Seldon's Plan points out the answer.  The magic of this book is the exquisite means the Foundation uses to defeat its enemies without resorting to force, and the convincing arguments Asimov uses to make these solutions seem inevitable.  As such, each chapter is like a sociopolitical puzzle that challenges the reader to find the move that will defuse each situation, and taken together these stories comprise a virtual primer in diplomacy.<br />Countless millions of fans have enjoyed Asimov's Foundation Trilogy, consisting of Foundation, Foundation and Empire, and Second Foundation.  Other Foundation novels, written by the master in his later years, lack the simple charm that makes these earlier works so popular.  They were tacked on solely because the power of those first three created a demand that Asimov felt obligated to try to fill, but they have an entirely different feel, and don't possess that single-minded surety of artistic vision that marked the original series.<br />This book is about political maneuvering, not action, so it may not be a favorite of action/adventure fans, although the next book in the series, Foundation and Empire, is a little more dynamic, and reading the complete Trilogy is a must, since the first two volumes don't so much end as just leave off.  Still, the vast historical vision begun in this book is so sweeping, it should not be missed by any fans of speculative fiction.o try to fill, but they have an entirely different feel, and don't possess that single-minded surety of artistic vision that marked the original series.<br />This book is about political maneuvering, not action, so it may not be a favorite of action/adventure fans, although the next book in the series, Foundation and Empire, is a little more dynamic, and reading the complete Trilogy is a must, since the first two volumes don't so much end as just leave off.

His pursuit of this feline takes him on a wild adventure that causes him to cross paths with a dazzling array of professional wrestlers, religious fanatics, parapsychologists, mobsters working for Fun, Inc., agents of the Federal Bureau of Loyalty, and a host of other eccentric individuals, all of whom seem determined to get their hands on the green cat.<br />The colorful characters are the real strength of this unusually under-plotted book (the story is little more than a long chase after the elusive cat), but the action is breakneck-paced, and the surprises just don't stop, which makes this book almost impossible to put down. Equally unusual in science fiction are the strong female characters, who while by no means perfect or even always likable, manage to make their own decisions and frequently demonstrate their superiority to the weak and/or immoral men in the story. Especially memorable are June Jones, the lady wrestler who wrestles men for a living, but befriends the helpless Phil, and Mitzi Romadka, the courageous daughter of a sadistic doctor, who would rather die than give in to weakness, even while flaunting her femininity.<br />While there are occasionally some brief lapses into sci-fi sophistry, this book is primarily a comedy: a fast moving, easy to read romp that should please readers young and old, but would not be recommended for those who take their science fiction seriously.  The social satire is not especially pointed, and there are relatively few interesting ideas, scientific or otherwise, but for sheer escapist reading pleasure, this book certainly delivers top quality.	2001-05-31

These tales were originally published individually, but together they are 'bookended' by &quot;Silence Please&quot; and &quot;The Defenestration of Ermintrude Inch&quot; to create a kind of frame story. Purvis' deadpan declamations of yarns that range from all-too-believable to patently absurd, combined with the fictional Clarke's own pointed comments about the White Hart, its clientele, and Purvis' overall credibility, make this perhaps the funniest science fiction book ever written. Using analogy in place of logic, Purvis posits wildly improbable advances in a number of different directions that in some cases have paralleled actual scientific developments that have taken place in the decades since these stories were written.<br />More serious-minded fans should take pleasure in the not-always-easy task of finding the precise flaws in Purvis' stories, which usually include just enough hard science to be credible to the casual layman. &quot;The Next Tenants&quot; is the only story in this collection that has any really serious message to it, and while the story is chillingly effective despite its absurdities, this book is really about laughs. From that standpoint, &quot;Moving Spirit&quot; is probably the best, featuring an eccentric millionaire, his illegal distillery, and a hilarious courtroom scene in which Purvis testifies as an expert witness with devastating results.<br />Despite the occasional slapstick moments, Clarke's humor is generally on the dry side, so this book may not please everyone. There isn't a lot of action in the traditional action/adventure sense, and female characters are usually absent or antagonistic. Still, if you're comfortable in a males-only, scientific atmosphere, there's plenty of good clean fun to be had at the White Hart., if you're comfortable in a males-only, scientific atmosphere, there's plenty of good clean fun to be had at the White Hart.	2001-05-25

The characterization is about what you'd expect from science fiction stories, and of the novellas, only the hero of &quot;Darfstellar&quot; shows real development.  Nor is plotting Miller's great strength - too many of the conclusions seem obvious well before the halfway point.  As a group, these stories get their punch from powerful ideas - problems that humankind has never solved, but which are likely to get worse in the future.  Although Miller doesn't offer any easy  solutions, his stories are intelligent and thought provoking, opening up the kind of dialogue that's necessary if these matters are ever to be settled at all. Also noteworthy are his powerful heroines.  The overwhelming force of a mother's love drives the folksy &quot;You Triflin' Skunk&quot; and the darker &quot;Vengeance for Nikolai&quot;, while &quot;Anybody Else Like Me?&quot; shows a woman driven to fight for her right to privacy.  Another common theme is the question of how we define what it means to be human.  Miller attacks this problem biologically in the unusual plague drama of &quot;Dark Benediction&quot; and the more-relevant-than-ever &quot;Conditionally Human&quot;, and again in a more technological vein with &quot;I, Dreamer&quot;.  But while these stories are good enough in their way, Miller is most effective when describing the plight of the common workingman.  Whether in conflict with technology that replaces him, or with environments that seem determined to destroy him (or at least impinge upon his freedom of action, as in &quot;Dumb Waiter&quot;), Miller's workingman manages to maintain his essential dignity, continues to care about his fellow man, and holds fast to the basic values that separate him from the machine.  The best of these stories is &quot;Crucifixus Etiam&quot;, in which earthmen working on the planet Mars must choose between a less miserable present and the chance to return home in the future.  Miller makes us feel the hero's pain, his terror, and his longing for home, in a way that makes us wonder whether we would be able to make the harsh choices that he makes. Miller's tales often remind us that the true price of human expansion is the hard labor performed by those who are least likely to be compensated for it, and thus proves that true heroism often consists of just doing an unpleasant task that needs to be done - a lesson we should all try to learn.  Miller may not be one of the grandmasters of the genre, but this book should please any fan of mid-twentieth-century science fiction.as in &quot;Dumb Waiter&quot;), Miller's workingman manages to maintain his essential dignity, continues to care about his fellow man, and holds fast to the basic values that separate him from the machine.

Aside from the handful of &quot;short shorts&quot; involving the chirpsithtra, Niven's yarn-spinning aliens, these stories have no real connection to any of his other works.  Generally, the long stories are the more satisfying, as with the space mutiny in &quot;One Face&quot;, and especially the hard-nosed Private Investigator fiction of &quot;The Meddler&quot; (which features perhaps the most memorable character in a book weak on characterization), while the shorter works such as &quot;Mistake&quot; and &quot;Convergent Series&quot; come off as, at most, clever.  Perhaps the best stories are those that deal with the complexities of time travel, where Niven lets his logical gifts wrestle with the standard paradoxes of cause and effect with interesting, and for once almost believable, results.  Sadly, the short story format leaves little or no room for what is surely Niven's greatest strength - constructing vast new worlds, new races, and new social orders populated with unusal beings that stay with us long after the book is finished.  Instead, we see Niven trying out different kinds of stories, with varying results.  Fans of Niven's work will find that some of these stories are wryly amusing, others are seriously thought-provoking, and others are perhaps overly precious.  Despite its breadth, however, this collection is not strong enough overall to serve as a good introduction to Niven's work because the individual stories themselves aren't that great.  If you aren't already a fan of Niven's &quot;hard&quot; science fiction, start off with one of his fine novels instead of this book of second rate stories.	2001-05-05
US	49836087	R3M0L3WGWPI7JY	0553204262	74845460	Medicine for Melancholy	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Quiet,sympathetic tales for Bradbury fans	This is a particularly modest collection from short story master Ray Bradbury; one that is not likely to win any new converts to his uniquely hushed, calming, understated fiction.  Instead of rhetorical fireworks, Bradbury employs an almost poetic tone that tends to have a comforting, lullaby effect.  Fans of Bradbury's style will certainly enjoy the delicate moods he evokes amid vast, silent landscapes, but less committed readers may be displeased to find so little in the science fiction vein with which Bradbury has been so successful.  There isn't much horror in this volume, either - only &quot;Fever Dream&quot; achieves the level of helpless terror that makes this genre work.  Nor is humor his real strength - only the two Irish tales, &quot;The First Night of Lent&quot; and &quot;The Great Collision of Monday Last,&quot; make any real attempt at being amusing.  Perhaps what Bradbury best provides here is sympathy.  His protagonists (both male and female) are often characterized by a quiet yearning, an emptiness inside that makes their lives seem a chore rather than a joy, and the plot generally revolves around the question of how (or whether) this inner need is satisfied.  Thus a middle-aged man's hunger for great art, (as in &quot;In a Season of Calm Weather&quot;), a young woman's need for love (in &quot;A Medicine for Melancholy&quot;), an immigrant family's homesickness (in &quot;The Strawberry Window&quot;), and an elderly man's longing for rain (in &quot;The Day It Rained Forever&quot;), all become important, not because they matter too much in themselves, but because Bradbury looks at them so very closely.  These aren't life or death issues; they are things that occur inside the hearts of human beings and nowhere else.  Yet somehow Bradbury's great sympathy for these people is evident in the very detail with which he describes his characters and the humdrum ordinariness of their lives.  There's beauty in these quiet, slow motion stories, but many just seem to fade in and out with scarcely a whimper.  So while Bradbury's longtime fans will surely enjoy this sample of the master's work, it's probably worth re-iterating that those readers who consider Bradbury's prose boring and tedious will find nothing here to change their minds.to fade in and out with scarcely a whimper.

US	49836087	R12CBPKF0YQVW9	0425034518	996804449	Starlight	Books	3	1	3	N	N	Too few good stories among too many forgettable ones	Two collections of Bester's short stories, &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot; and &quot;Star Light, Star Bright&quot; are published together in this single volume.  Without meaning to denigrate Mr. Bester's skills as a writer (he has a number of excellent novels to his credit), this is an uneven collection at best.  A fascination with (now largely discredited) Freudian psychology runs through many of these stories, often to their detriment, as exemplified by the rambling ravings of &quot;5,271,009&quot; and the almost silly &quot;Oddy and Id&quot;.  Bester tends to let his characters' eccentricities become the whole story, rather than just a part of it, so the tale's entire impact hangs on how believable readers find that character to be.  The above-named stories (among too many others) fail completely on that basis, while the stronger yarns, such as &quot;Fondly Fahrenheit&quot; and &quot;They Don't Make Life Like They Used To&quot; are credible enough to capture the reader's attention and hold it.  &quot;Fahrenheit&quot; is probably the strongest entry in this volume, a maddening tale about a defective android whose destructive behavior brings disaster to its unlucky owner.  Up to the same high standard is &quot;Adam and No Eve&quot;, an agonizing rendering of the last man on Earth, who must live with the knowledge that he has destroyed himself and his entire world with his own hubris.  These two stories in themselves deserve the very highest rating.  Unfortunately, the rest of this book is composed of Freudian nonsense (&quot;The Four Hour Fugue&quot;), pointless time travel stories (&quot;Of Time and Third Avenue&quot; is especially forgettable), silly mind-over-matter yarns (like the disappointing &quot;Star Light, Star Bright&quot;, which starts out well enough, but goes nowhere), and trite deals with the devil (including the endless &quot;Hell is Forever&quot;).  Some of this material might have been exciting or even revolutionary 50 years ago when it was first published, but the science of psychology has progressed enormously during the interval, leaving these stories badly out of date. Perhaps this is why Mr. Bester chose to leave science fiction for greener (and possibly less demanding) pastures.published, but the science of psychology has progressed enormously during the interval, leaving these stories badly out of date.

The therapy Render practices is called neuroparticipation, and allows the doctor to enter the dreams of his patients and act out fantasies that ease the patients' problems.  While this may seem a little far-fetched, Zelazny has posited a world where such marvels as programmable flying cars and intelligent talking dogs are cutting edge technology.  Despite the difficulty of his work, Render himself seems a less than perfect psychological specimen.  He harbors some lingering guilt over the death of his wife some years previously, and compensates for it by being very overprotective of his brilliant young son.  This doesn't prevent him from undertaking the most challenging patient of his career, Eileen Shallot, a blind-from-birth Resident in Psychiatry who wants to be a neuroparticipant like Render.  The dream-molding device enables Eileen to see with Render's eyes, and much of the action of the novel is Eileen's adventures in learning to see.  Although not overlong, this book strike one as a marvelous short story that has been padded out to an all-too-predictable conclusion.  Much of the book seems pointless and off the subject and is often merely confusing, especially when it shifts point of view.  For example, the long digressions with Render's girlfriend Jill DeVille and the extended trip with the talking dog both contribute nothing to the story, and could have been cut without any loss whatsoever.  But perhaps the biggest weakness of this book is that none of the characters are particularly likable.  Render is over-confident, over-bearing, and self-centered.  Miss DeVille's attraction to him seems almost unfathomable unless we assume she's after his money.  And Eileen Shallot seems driven by a monomania that is more of a handicap than her blindness.  As a result, the reader can be forgiven for not much caring about what happens to these people.  Zelazny's skill with prose is never in doubt; his descriptions are almost poetic in their serene beauty, but he gives himself very little plot to work with here, and characters whose fate means nothing to us.  The dream sequences are not nearly as imaginative as one would expect, and the few interesting ideas we are presented us with don't really seem that revolutionary anymore in the 21st century, making this book a victory of style over substance.  If you're not really a fan of Zelazny's work, this one probably won't change your mind.not much caring about what happens to these people.

In this mysterious and only vaguely familiar land, the social order is dominated by the Guilds, who exercise enormous control over the lives of their members, each of whom plays some small part in a grand scheme whose totality is shrouded in the mists of antiquity.  Thus one of the main threads of the story is always &quot;How did things get this way?&quot; Silverberg uses the story of a simple Watcher to reveal a long and complex history of Earth's rise, foolish pride, and subsequent fall.  The Watcher's job is to search the skies, but why and for what is not immediately clear.  Against a backdrop of magic, sunken continents, alien creatures, ancient wrongs and endless wandering around what we would call the Old World (Roum, Perris, and Jorslem), we come to appreciate the Watcher as a human being.  In his love for the Flier Avluela and his loyalty to the Prince of Roum, amidst his failures, betrayals, renewal, and redemption, we see a microcosm of the human race's own journey from arrogance to fear to humility and finally beyond.  A quiet melancholy pervades this book, as our protagonist wanders among the remnants of Earth's glory years, now decrepit relics.  Yet Silverberg finds a way to conclude with the promise of salvation.  Despite the unfamiliarity of the social order and the slightly modified place names, the book is easy reading, even for younger readers.  There is no over-abundance of action, or of science, either, really, so perhaps this book won't be a favorite of everyone.  There is violent conflict aplenty, but much of it takes place &quot;off-stage&quot; so it won't overpower the fainthearted.  The mild sexual content is handled pretty much the same way, making it acceptable reading for all but the most sheltered young teens.  In short, Silverberg weaves a spell of quiet mystery, timeless beauty, and eternal human values that is sure to entrance.	2001-03-08
US	49836087	R2OI9384PEFPLV	0345301374	993744693	The Cool War	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Light and refreshing, but low on substance	Unitarian minister Reverend Hornswell &quot;Horny&quot; Hake is forced to join a secret government cadre of dirty tricksters called &quot;the Team&quot; in this wry, futuristic spoof of a spy novel.  Hapless Hake's total incompetence becomes apparent almost immediately when he is abducted by the mysterious Leota, who works for an underground organization dedicated to fighting the Team.  This doesn't stop Hake from carrying out his first assignment: escorting an unruly bunch of teenagers on a tour of Europe in order to reduce worker productivity.  This campaign is typical of the &quot;Cool War&quot; Pohl envisions in which nations engage in covert operations designed to make the opponent significantly less competitive economically without the kind of national culpability that might generate a military response.  Hake finds himself well rewarded for his pains, but is troubled by the moral implications of his actions.  In particular, he worries that the minor annoyances caused by the Team are hurting innocent people more than their governments.  The intentional wastefulness of the Team goes against his long-ingrained distaste for what this resource-starved society calls &quot;piggery&quot;, and in several subsequent encounters Leota asks him how he justifies his part in activities that seem so morally abhorrent and at the same time so politically meaningless.  As Hake begins to act more independently, he falls afoul of the Reddi brothers, a pair (literally) of professional mercenaries who sometimes work with the Team, and other times work against it.  Will Hake make his final stand for the Team, against the Team, or for himself? There are few enough really likable characters in this cynical, but still amusing novel, and Hake in particular is so easily dominated by whomever he happens to be with at the time, that readers may want to shake him and shout &quot;Why are you doing this&quot;?  The story seems to imply that any attempt to interfere with the lives of strangers (for whatever reason) is ultimately both immoral and self-defeating.  Even the seductive Leota comes to realize this eventually, at what may be thought of as the turning point of the novel.  The Cool War has eliminated violent military conflict, but still espouses a spirit of competition and mutual degradation, which in the end, can't be good for anyone.  Although this book addresses some serious issues, the tone is light and comedic, so it doesn't leave much of an impact.  The combination of sci-fi spy thriller and romantic comedy, while unusual and even refreshing, just isn't that effective, so while this book is likable and even amusing, there may not be enough substance to satisfy everyone.(for whatever reason) is ultimately both immoral and self-defeating.

An enormous, self-sufficient colonial expedition has been sent out towards a distant star.  But human weakness interferes with the designers' well-laid plans when a mutiny leads to the death of every officer capable of piloting the ship.  Generations later, when the story opens, the ship is still wandering aimlessly through space, the indefatigable engineering systems still running flawlessly; but the &quot;crew&quot; has lost virtually all knowledge of what their mission was, and no longer even realize they are in a moving vessel.  The ship is their entire Universe, and when one man discovers otherwise, events unfold that rock their society to its foundations.  &quot;Universe&quot; is very entertaining in a cerebral way, as we see how the ship's rules and traditions and history have become distorted into legends, myths, and of course, religion.  Heinlein's practical knowledge of ship's organization serves him well here, too, as he paints a portrait of the working (if not exactly ideal) society that developed during the generations following the mutiny.  And as usual, he pairs a good-hearted but naïve young protagonist (Hugh Hoyland) with a cynical, world-wise man-who-knows.  The fact that Heinlein chose a two-headed mutant (Joe-Jim) for this role seems a bit over the top, but Joe-Jim is certainly an outsider, and the presence of large numbers of physically mutated persons seems reasonable enough under the circumstances.  Still, a more believable mutation might have been a good idea - the very notion of a two-headed mutant may seem a little too &quot;pulp-magazine&quot; for adult readers.  &quot;Common Sense&quot; is the more action-oriented part of the novel, and doesn't offer as many fresh insights into the unique social order as does &quot;Universe&quot;.  It does succeed in tying up a lot of loose ends, and provides for a resolution that should satisfy on at least an emotional level.  Sadly, from a scientific view, the final outcome of this yarn is just painfully unlikely - a quintillion to one seems like a fair estimate - and even Heinlein (whose addiction to coincidence is well-documented) comes off rather apologetic when talking about the unlikelihood of his conclusion; but if one admits that &quot;human stubbornness in the face of inconvenient fact&quot; is the theme of this book, then how else can it end without putting poor Hugh in a very uncomfortable position?  While this book may be not strictly a juvenile, its weaknesses are very glaring indeed, and cannot be recommended for any adult readers who take their science fiction seriously.  On the other hand, younger readers should find this a mind-expanding adventure that brings them to see their own Universe in a brand new light.se&quot; is the more action-oriented part of the novel, and doesn't offer as many fresh insights into the unique social order as does &quot;Universe&quot;.

US	49836087	R3T224A8FAN980	1573458082	856259335	Storyteller in Zion	Books	2	30	35	N	N	More for LDS members than nonmembers	In this collection of essays, Orson Scott Card addresses a variety of issues relating to his religious beliefs, specifically, some contemporary views on the Church of Latter Day Saints; so fans of Card's novels may find this book somewhat out of their line.  The only fiction is the short story &quot;The Coming of the Nonmembers&quot;, which while slightly self-deprecating, does little to balance the utter seriousness of the book.  This volume will probably play better to church members than nonmembers, (this reviewer finds himself in the latter category), although there's an undeniable fascination in exploring this amazing culture that actually exists right here in the U.S. of A.  In &quot;The Book of Mormon - Artifact or Artifice?&quot; Card gets off to a rocky start, defensively trying to support the claim that the Book of Mormon is not fraudulent.  His points are reasonable, but not overpowering, and it seems unlikely anyone will change their minds on the basis of these musings.  This essay was very slow reading, perhaps due to this reader's total unfamiliarity with the work being analyzed.  The piece on &quot;Family Art&quot; was much more revealing, as it struck this reader that either Card was just laughably naïve, or else he was describing an entirely different social order - one which this Pennsylvania native was not even aware existed.  Card describes a world where children not only listen to their parents, but actually enjoy the kind of wholesome, non-violent group activities that this reader (having raised two boys himself) only dreams about.  If we take this essay at face value, it would be easy to conclude that the Saints are in fact the happiest people on Earth.  Card seems more plausible when discussing what he knows best -- the arts of writing and storytelling.  He posits a place for evil in fiction, and even in real life, insofar as everything is part of the Divine Plan.  He even tries to reconcile the very notion of fictive writing with his moral injunction to always tell the truth (and how many of us even consider such niceties any more?).  In &quot;Art as an Act of Charity&quot;, he describes the power and function of Art, and has numerous warnings for burgeoning artists about the dangers posed by the Art Establishment.  At once most controversial and most interesting is the section where Card indulges in sermonizing.  &quot;Consecration: A Law We Can Live With&quot; is a parable about tithing. &quot;Prophets and Assimilationists&quot; makes a stand for radical orthodoxy.  &quot;The Hypocrites of Homosexuality&quot; encourages readers to hate the sin, not the sinner, yet never questions the church's flat assertion that homosexuality is evil.  &quot;Living in Zion&quot; is perhaps the most ambitious entry, and describes Card's plan for bringing the utopia of Zion to fruition here on earth.  Most of this material is directed at LDS members, who, one might assume, have probably heard all this before.  For us nonmembers, the points of interest are too few to merit a recommendation.njunction to always tell the truth (and how many of us even consider such niceties any more?).

US	49836087	RHN2ZMQWI72TM	0312940076	153574937	Alien Cargo	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Humanity, compassion, optimism, make for good reading	This is a solid collection of short stories from one of the Grand Masters of science fiction and fantasy.  While many of these stories are over 50 years old, they hold up well because of the fantasy elements (which tend not to age so quickly), and the human elements (which one likes to think are universal).  Sturgeon is at his best when he's at his most economical; some of the longer stories (&quot;Cargo&quot; and &quot;The Traveling Crag&quot; in particular) dragged on longer than necessary.  However apart from &quot;Brat&quot; (a light farce about a baby who knows too much), and &quot;Two Percent Inspiration&quot; (a send up of standard science fiction adventures), the rest of these stories succeed in tapping into basic human emotions and situations that make them still relevant today.  Moreover, a strong streak of optimism runs through most of these stories, and even the most disastrous conflicts are not without silver linings.  The power of self-esteem in &quot;Won't You Walk...&quot;, the simple joys of being human in the light-hearted &quot;Poker Face&quot;, the importance of community expressed in &quot;The Touch of Your Hand&quot;, all point to an unchanging moral order that transcends the centuries.  Other standouts include &quot;Microcosmic God&quot;, which describes a conflict between an inventive creator and an unscrupulous profiteer, and &quot;It&quot;, with its Gothic American setting and feel.  But the best story is easily &quot;Bright Segment&quot;, the only completely straight fiction in the collection, and the most gripping emotionally.  A quiet, insignificant man who has never felt needed in his life finds himself caring for a horribly injured young woman whose very presence must be kept secret.  Working in a small, almost claustrophobic setting with just two characters (one of whom has very few lines), Sturgeon drives home the lonesome protagonist's terror, courage, determination, and compassion to create a truly unforgettable effect.  Even those readers who aren't fans of science fiction and fantasy may find this story worth looking up, but for those who are, &quot;Bright Segment&quot; is the capstone of a very satisfying collection.readers who aren't fans of science fiction and fantasy may find this story worth looking up, but for those who are, &quot;Bright Segment&quot; is the capstone of a very satisfying collection.	2001-01-27
US	49836087	R3RY86VORXYKU6	0399118160	103043493	Star Light, Star Bright (Volume II)	Books	2	1	4	N	N	Could have use more polishing	Only devoted fans of Alfred Bester's science fiction and fantasy will be enthralled with this book, a collection of largely forgettable stories and other odds and ends.  The book wisely opens with a bang - the powerfully moving &quot;Adam and No Eve&quot; which describes the fate of the driven scientific visionary who becomes the last man on Earth.  In an unusual twist, the intrepid explorer's determination to reach for the stars instigates an ecological catastrophe that renders the whole planet uninhabitable.  Bester gets maximum mileage from his skill at writing prose that is heavy with violence and pain in this paean to a lost world.  This kind of story is not for everyone, of course, but it's easily the best piece in this collection.  Of the remaining stories, the more memorable are those that feature aberrant personalities, like the not-quite lovable kooks in &quot;They Don't Make Life Like They Used To&quot; and the frightening but fascinating lunatic who calls himself &quot;The Pi Man&quot;.  In a lighter vein, &quot;Something Up There Likes Me&quot; shows us the proud parents of an intelligent satellite and how their loving &quot;son&quot; affects their lives, as well as those of everyone on the planet. Included in the collection are three stories about time travel: the psychologically-based &quot;Time Is the Traitor&quot; fizzles despite some strong characterizations, &quot;Hobson's Choice&quot; suggests that one can never be happy outside one's own milieu, and &quot;Of Time and Third Avenue&quot; is a thoroughly forgettable yarn about an almanac from the future.  The theme behind each of these stories is that time travel is a dead end to be avoided.  Bester seems to think that better results can be obtained by mental control over external events, as with the genius in &quot;Star Light, Star Bright&quot;, although he points out the dangers of such powers in &quot;Oddy and Id&quot;.  His interview with sci-fi legend Isaac Asimov is far too short to be memorable, and the autobiographical essay &quot;My Affair with Science Fiction&quot; may be interesting to Bester's fans, but isn't especially notable in itself.  Few of these stories are scientific enough to show their age (although most of them are over 40 years old), but the ideas espoused in this collection seem to somehow fall a little short.  Bester is surely a very talented writer, but too many of these stories have a half-finished quality that begs for another re-write, as though most of the story were written before he'd worked out the ending, and then once finished, he didn't have time to go back and fit the first half to the second.  In any case, only &quot;Adam and No Eve&quot; really merits a recommendation.  The rest of this book can be skipped without any major loss.ble, and the autobiographical essay &quot;My Affair with Science Fiction&quot; may be interesting to Bester's fans, but isn't especially notable in itself.

If that simple fact doesn't send you off book-burning right from the start, then you might find some small entertainment value in this mildly interesting story.  People and things are rarely what they seem in this convoluted, but still easy to follow book, starting with the girl, Tappy.  Blind,(although doctors say there's nothing wrong with her eyes), and mute, (although she talks in her sleep), and all the while wearing a leg brace, Tappy eventually takes Jack on a hike up a mountain side, walks right into a large rock, and leads him through it into another world.  There they encounter a race of primitives (who nonetheless have some useful technologies), as well as some helpful androids, who explain that Tappy is actually the human host for the Imago, a sentient being that promotes empathy for all life.  This makes her supremely dangerous to the Gaol, a race of brutal conquerors who rule the galaxy, and who intend to continue ruling it by imprisoning Tappy.  Although there are some slow spots in the first half of the book, there are also lots of twists and surprises; but as is often the case with fantasies, the successive shocks become less and less impressive as you go along.  Anthony has a good eye for description, and Farmer's sections are quickly discernable by their more scientific rationalizations, so that as a whole the book reads pretty well.  Perhaps instead of asking &quot;Who are you?&quot; the Caterpillar should be asking &quot;Who is your target audience?&quot;  The sexual content guarantees that this book can't be recommended to young readers, despite the fact that the authors try to assuge Jack's guilt by showing his remorse, Tappy's need, and the effect of the Imago living inside of her.  On the other hand, there's little in the way of truly deep philosophical thought or sophisticated scientific speculation to lure the more experienced adult readers.  So while this is not in all ways a bad book, the number of people who will really just love it is probably very small.of truly deep philosophical thought or sophisticated scientific speculation to lure the more experienced adult readers.

The story focuses on a young Japanese couple: Reiko and her husband Tetsuo.  Tetsuo is smart, ambitious, and believes in the synthesis of Eastern traditions and modern Western methods.  This has gained him some small reputation as a rebel, for which he sometimes overcompensates by being ultra-conservative.  Reiko herself is a very modern Japanese woman, and longs for the respect and independence that  Western girls have, but mainly she just wants to be included in Tetsuo's life, even as he seems to grow ever more distant.  This changes only superficially with Reiko's pregnancy.  In an effort to give his child the best possible start in life, Tetsuo involves Reiko in a high-tech experiment in pre-natal instruction, with astounding results.  Reiko overcomes her own misgivings for her husband's sake, until she discovers the terrible price her son may have to pay for his intellect.  The conflict focuses on modernism vs. tradition, technology vs. spirituality, and the needs of the individual vs. the pressures of society.  Brin cleverly sets his story in Japan, even at the risk of alienating his Western readers, in order to heighten these conflicts.  There's a good deal of suspense as Reiko tries to understand exactly what's happening to the women who participate in this experiment, but it's a shame that the answers Brin gives us are so outrageous. Believable as the first half of the book is, the second half seems pretty ridiculous, and badly undercuts any serious message this story might have hoped to convey.  While this really isn't a bad story, the method of publication is very poorly thought out.  The story is published all by itself as Short Story Paperback #45, running just over 40 pages and selling for $1.95, which is quite reasonable for a book, but pretty steep for just a single story.  Readers might be better advised to spend their hard-earned dollars on a paperback version of one of Brin's many fine novels, any of which can be counted on to provide many hours of entertainment for perhaps three times the price.a book, but pretty steep for just a single story.

There's virtually no science fiction here, but there are some interesting ideas.  The title piece is almost a short novel, and features a husband and wife detective team who are hired to find out exactly what their client does during the daylight hours.  The answer takes them on a journey through the looking glass to a world of evil secrets that lie just beneath the surface of our comfortable reality.  There are plenty of surprises and a fair amount of suspense, but Heinlein's hazy ending may leave some readers unsatisfied.  The remaining stories in the collection are a pretty mixed bag, highlighted by &quot;All You Zombies&quot;, which is not about zombies at all, but still delivers a powerful punch.  Without giving away the plot, the protagonist manages to recount the story of his (generally speaking) totally unique life.  Although by no means prurient, this story has some sexual components that could lead to very embarrassing questions if read by the very young, so be forewarned.  Equally solipsistic is the paranoid fantasy &quot;They&quot;, in which a mental patient questions the very nature of reality.  Heinlein seems to enjoy this kind of philosophical rambling, but apart from the sharp ending, this story has little to recommend it.  Similarly, &quot;-And He Built a Crooked House&quot; involves speculation of a more mathematical nature.  An iconoclast architect designs, and then actually builds, a house in four dimensions, with what one assumes to be intended as comic effect, although having a stuffy dowager faint repeatedly seems more like an exercise in misogyny than in humor.  Even sillier is &quot;Our Fair City&quot;, in which Heinlein shows how a nosy newsman takes down a corrupt city government with the help of a trained pet whirlwind.  And &quot;The Man Who Traveled in Elephants&quot; is a wholly forgettable story about a man who spends his declining years visiting state fairs.  Heinlein shows considerable inventiveness in finding utterly unique plotlines for these stories, but not all of them actually succeed.  Still, this is a pretty entertaining collection, and should provide a welcome diversion for fantasy fans who are looking for something a little offbeat.Heinlein shows considerable inventiveness in finding utterly unique plotlines for these stories, but not all of them actually succeed.

Certainly it is no coincidence that this volume begins with (and is titled after) the powerful short story &quot;Riverworld&quot;, from which grew the series of novels so well known to readers of science fiction and fantasy.  In this story, every human being that ever walked the earth is suddenly resurrected along the banks of the million-mile river that winds through this unknown planet.  The friendship between Tom Mix and the mysterious Yeshua strikes at the heart of the religious implications of the Riverworld, yielding a truly unforgettable conclusion.  But segueing from the sublime to the ridiculous, the remaining stories are considerably less deserving fare, starting off with the shockingly sacrilegious &quot;J.C. on the Dude Ranch&quot;, where the guests &quot;work&quot; the cowboys.  While this story certainly makes a strong impression, some readers might find themselves offended by this ribald science-fiction take on the son of man.  And after these first two stories, the remainder of the book is utterly forgettable.  Very little of it qualifies as science fiction, and many of the pieces seem more like writing exercises than entertainments.  For example, &quot;The Jungle Rot Kid on the Nod&quot; is a send-up of William Burroughs writing a Tarzan story.  While this may have seemed like a cute enough idea in conception, the result is almost unreadable, and certainly is of no interest to anyone who is not seriously into Burroughs. Farmer also tries his hand at a couple of detective stories, but both &quot;The Volcano&quot; and &quot;The Problem of the Sore Bridge - Among Others&quot; emphasize style rather than substance; no true fan would even consider these detective stories, but rather science fiction fantasies.  Perhaps most disturbing are some of the more scatological entries, including the ultimately nonsensical &quot;The Leaser of Two Evils&quot;, the excremental mess of &quot;The Phantom of the Sewers&quot;, and the sadly wacky &quot;The Henry Miller Dawn Patrol&quot;, which details sexual conquests at a retirement home.  Farmer is certainly a great talent, but most of this collection shows him at his playful worst.  Don't be afraid to give it a miss.

The story opens prosaicly enough when Jim Pendrake, formerly of the US Air Force (and minus his right arm), discovers the wreck of an unusual vehicle with a totally unrecognizable engine.  The book seems to take its time progressing as this reclusive man takes possession of the engine, conducts some simple tests, and eventually has it taken away from him by unknown assailants.  The story shifts gears quickly though, once Pendrake notices that his missing arm has begun to grow back.  The pace accelerates after his investigations lead him into the hands of a sinister, secret organization and even bring him to the attention of President Jefferson Dayles, who has his own less-than-savory agenda.  Things really get confusing when he loses his memory, develops a new life, escapes his captors, and loses his arm (again), only to wind up being abducted (again), and this time left to die on the moon, where he discovers a society ruled by a million-year-old super-intelligent Neanderthal man.  There are a substantial number of further twists and turns in this story, but hopefully one gets the idea.  This is a book filled with action, suspense, and particularly surprises, but perhaps its most noteworthy feature is the questions it poses about the cultural revolution that took place in the U.S. around the time the book was written.  Van Vogt challenges us to question the place of women in society by postulating a treatment that would allow women to become the &quot;equal of men&quot; in aggressiveness and ruthlessness.  He wonders exactly what men expect from women by placing a stalwart monogamist into a society of bigamists.  He suggests that Pendrake's regenerative power only makes him more prone to engage in violent and dangerous behavior, putting an unusual slant on the relationship between violence and medicine.  But most of all, this book is about power, and how the lust for power drives so many to behave like the beast in his title.  Virtually every character is both victim and victimizer at various points in the story, but van Vogt takes pains to point out that only by rising above this primal urge to dominate others can humanity ever hope to become more than a vicious animal.  Despite the wild plot and somewhat disjointed structure, this book is both an entertaining and thought-provoking piece of speculative fiction, definitely worth a read.tween violence and medicine.

US	49836087	R3FZ6H7UEYID4S	0523485352	426720088	Greatheart Silver	Books	2	4	5	N	N	A parody of action/adventure classics	This book is comprised of three self-contained adventures, each of which was originally published separately.  All three feature the same main character, a redoubtable airship officer named Greatheart Silver, and there is enough continuity between the three adventures to create the illusion of a novel, but not the actual impact of one.  The first episode opens with Silver's fall from grace as an airship officer, then goes on to detail his revenge at a wild shootout.  The Shootout is easily the most memorable section of the book; Farmer gives his playful imagination free rein in a reunion of major adventure heroes and villains from the past century, including not-so-subtle variations of Doc Savage, James Bond, the Lone Ranger, and countless others.  Comic effect is heightened by presenting all these characters as past their prime physically, and down on their luck financially, but the end result is more humorous for its madcap concept than for the quality of its execution.  Still, it cannot be denied that Farmer handles this kind of mass combat scene as well as any writer in the field, and the pleasure he takes in gathering all these characters together for one final mad brawl comes across well, especially if the reader is also (like Farmer) an aficionado of the action/adventure/detective thrillers of the past.  Part Two is a fairly straight kidnapping yarn, although the mad scientist who plans to take over the world via the high-tech distribution of pornography is somewhat over the top, and the publishing house where writers are shackled to their typewriters must have struck a chord with Farmer's writer friends.  In Part Three the technical details of the airship come to the fore as several gangs of ne'er-do-wells simultaneously attempt to wrest control of the ship from newly promoted Captain Silver.  Since neither of these sections is quite as funny as its predecessors, the book does not so much build to a climax as drift until it collapses.  Farmer demonstrates a good command of parody, a rare skill with action, and some facility with mystery/detective stories, but serious science fiction fans will find little to maintain their interest, and the book's weak technical structure undercuts the overall effect.  Fans of action/adventure classics will find some delightfully droll moments in this book, but many other readers will not be amused.good command of parody, a rare skill with action, and some facility with mystery/detective stories, but serious science fiction fans will find little to maintain their interest, and the book's weak technical structure undercuts the overall effect.

Having led a pathetically feeble revolt against an infinitely more powerful military force, Ivar has no choice but to hide among the various nomadic peoples of his planet, hoping that their innate distrust of outsiders will dissuade them from betraying him.  He gains an ally in Erannath, a large, bird-like creature from another empire, but no one can say for certain what his real agenda is.  The story climaxes when Ivar is introduced to Jaan, a prophet who is possessed by a 6-million-year-old member of the race of &quot;Elders&quot; whose archeological remains are venerated all over the planet.  Can these two men set in motion forces that will free their people before being captured by Terran police?  This reader found himself not caring well before the halfway point of this tedious book.  Indeed, the first two-thirds of the novel are painfully slow and pointless, as various characters are elaborately positioned, analyzed, and persuaded.  Although Anderson's powers of description are excellent, at times even poetic, and his use of the Elder, Caruith, is intriguing, his action scenes are too often abbreviated, or even skipped, showing us only the aftermath of the action.  It was probably a mistake to choose<br />Frederiksen as the main character, since he does little of significance until the very end.  Instead, he spends most of the book running and hiding, and there's very little thrill in this chase since his trackers are seldom close enough or dangerous enough to really engage the reader.  Anderson had a good enough idea for this book, showing how a rebellious young man of privilege could join forces with a working-class visionary to shake up the establishment, but he took far too long to get his story started, and by the time things really got moving, it was nearly ended.  It's hard to believe that the average reader will even finish this book, let alone enjoy it.started, and by the time things really got moving, it was nearly ended.

US	49836087	R3C4O0C0DVF79A	0553291890	941430498	More Than One Universe: The Collected Stories of Arthur C. Clarke	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Clarke's classic collections collected	More Than One Universe is a compendium of several of Clarke's collections of short stories gathered together in one volume.  As such, devotees of Clarke's work will find nothing new here, but for the uninitiated, this book is a remarkable exposition of the work of one of science fiction's bona fide masters.  Although universally acclaimed for his novels (2001: A Space Odyssey, and Childhood's End among others), Clarke's short stories are also widely regarded as classics in the field, and this volume shows why.  One of the mainstays of the genre is what may be called the \\"reading problem\\" story, wherein the hero is put into a desperate situation from which he (and the reader) are challenged to find a way out.  Such stories have been popular since the inception of the form, largely because science fiction opens up so many new venues for the traditional Man Against Nature conflict.  Clarke shows his skill at presenting these puzzles, as evidenced by \\"Summertime on Icarus\\" (where the hero is in danger of being grilled alive by the heat of the sun), \\"Into the Comet\\" (wherein a space vessel loses all visibility and instrumentation) and \\"Maelstrom II\\"(orbiting the moon without rocket power), just to pick a few examples.  Of course, the real test of a science fiction writer is in how well he works outside the standard formulae, and many of these pieces were ground-breaking indeed when they were first published.  Clarke predicts the collapse of Western civilization into decadence in \\"Patent Pending\\" and \\"I Remember Babylon\\", and more seriously, questions divine will in \\"The Nine Billion Names of God\\" and \\"The Star\\". \\"Before Eden\\" warns how easily space exploration can become a destructive, even genocidal act, while in \\"Superiority\\" he describes how a warring nation defeats itself with technological advances.  Lastly, \\"The Sentinel\\" leaves one of the most memorable (and convincing) depictions of how men might learn of other intelligences in the universe.  Not every one of these fifty-odd stories is a masterpiece, of course, and as with most classic s-f, there's very little room for romance -- women are a decided minority in these tales -- so readers of the female persuasion may not be too enthused.  On the other hand, this very lack of sexual context makes the book entirely appropriate for even the youngest teens.  This is an excellent book for a young reader just discovering science fiction, but be aware that many longtime readers will already own a lot of these stories in other collections.se fifty-odd stories is a masterpiece, of course, and as with most classic s-f, there's very little room for romance -- women are a decided minority in these tales -- so readers of the female persuasion may not be too enthused.

A descendent of Caucasians in a post-apocalyptic world where Orientals rule, Sanjen is a social misfit.  His career as a captain in the Fleet ends dramatically when he makes the mistake of being right while everyone else is wrong, and gets court-martialed on the word of his trusted second-in-command, the ambitious and unscrupulous Tonji.  Ignoring Sanjen's advice, the Empire gets embroiled in a one-sided war with the mysterious beings known as the Quarn, with catastrophic results.  Only after surviving a long bout with despair is Sanjen able to function again, and it is at this point that Tonji (now his superior) sends him to supervise the defense of a remote planet called Veden, where the real story begins.  Without giving away too much of the plot (and believe it or not, this reviewer hasn't), Sanjen must survive assassination attempts, civil unrest, religious fanatics, mind control, and seemingly endless treachery.  Benford is skilled at creating moods that reflect the tenor of his characters' thoughts, and he uses this to great effect in this novel, where the reader actually feels the horror, the disgust, the depression, the indignation, the manic excitement, etc. that his protagonist feels.  Unfortunately, this strength may also be the book's greatest weakness, because so much of the story has a pall of doom cast over it that the reader may simply stop caring, just as the characters are tempted to do.  Benford's science is exemplary, and his speculations about alien/futuristic social forms are interesting (if not necessarily entertaining), but overall this book is too much of a &quot;downer&quot; to get a good recommendation.  Students of science fiction writing may take interest in the subtle way Benford uses point of view in this novel, but readers who think that science fiction ought to be fun can feel free to give it a miss.feel free to give it a miss.	2000-09-20

Slow and plodding as this painful work is, one can only wonder how anyone manages to read the longer, novel version.  An ominous pall hangs over this story about the exploration of Mars, with none of the rapture one might expect from an encounter with a being who may or may not be Jesus.  Even though creating these grim, depressing moods is one of Farmer's specialties, the use of this tone in this context seriously undercuts the curiously equivocal ending, not to mention the sense of wonder that is the essence of good science fiction.  On the other hand, the excerpt &quot;Riverworld War&quot; is a thrilling, action-packed depiction of the battle between the two riverboats captained by Sam Clemens and King John, all of which will be familiar (at least in general) to readers of Farmer's excellent Riverworld series.  Good as it is, however, readers who are not familiar with these fine novels will find this fragment utterly confusing and ultimately pointless.  Even for those who've grown to know and love these characters, the five chapters presented here, comprising about twenty pages, and all utterly bereft of context, are nothing more than an entertaining footnote to The Magic Labyrinth, from which it was originally cut due to space limitations.  It's hard to see how even completists who want to read every word Farmer's ever written can find much merit in these superfluities.	2000-09-20

The conflicts between swordsmen,  magicians, and other sundry troublemakers is generally standard enough, but  while some fantasy writers lean towards the gothic and others tend to be  more cosmological in scope, Niven tries to keep his work solidly grounded  in science - even though the setting is 12,000 years ago.  To this end, he  allows the existence of something called &quot;mana&quot; - the basic force  of nature that powers all magic - and further postulates that this mana  could potentially be used up, like any other natural resource, and thus  leave the world as we know it today completely without magic.  In this way  Niven attempts to find a scientifically valid approach to fitting warlocks,  werewolves, trolls and other problematic beings into their appropriate  niche in human pre-history. The first story, &quot;Not Long Before the  End&quot;, is entertaining, suspenseful, and very nicely constructed.  It  introduces the hero of the book, the Warlock (whose name must be kept  secret, since whoever knows his name has power over him), and reveals his  discovery that the magic he has devoted his life to will ultimately dwindle  and fail.  &quot;What Good is a Glass Dagger?&quot; shows how prescience,  preparation, adroit maneuvering, and a glass dagger stand the Warlock in  good stead during a long duel with the evil magician Wavyhill.  These two  stories, occupying about half of the book, are both excellent examples of  the possibilities of the form, taking a fairly conservative approach to  what magic can do.  The longest story, &quot;The Magic Goes Away&quot;,  however, with its long cloud voyage and sexual exploration, is  disappointingly tedious.  The sexual angle makes it unsuitable for younger  readers, while other fans may find this piece too short on action.

Each of these tales is a  well-constructed, timely investigation into our technological future,  displaying a master's command of both mood and technique.  The blurring  line between man and machine is explored sympathetically in  &quot;Me/Days,&quot; (a story narrated by the computer), breezily in  &quot;Snatching the Bot,&quot; and more seriously in &quot;To the Storming  Gulf&quot; (with its post-apocalyptic nod to Faulkner).  More often,  though, Benford shows the powerful effect technology has on human beings:  the xenobiologists who risk their lives to study enormous alien creatures  in &quot;In Alien Flesh,&quot; the ship's crew racing helplessly towards  the end of the universe in &quot;Relativistic Effects,&quot; and the doomed  tourists in &quot;Of Space/Time and the River.&quot;  &quot;Time  Shards&quot; describes a little-known technology for listening in to the  past, but casts doubt on the usefulness of such researches; the story's  focus is on a brilliant scientist and an antiquarian who come to realize  that their life's work is no more than a mere curiosity.  In a more  philosophical vein, &quot;Time's Rub&quot; presents a choice between life  and immortality in the guise of a simple game offered by an immortal being.  Ending on a somewhat lighter note, &quot;Doing Lennon&quot; describes a  wealthy man's plan to have himself frozen, then awakened in the next  century, where he will claim to be the late John Lennon.

More action-oriented than The Man Who Sold the  Moon, and more focused than The Green Hills of Earth, the reputation of the  Heinlein's Future History lies primarily with the longish story &quot;If  This Goes On -&quot; and the short novel Methuselah's Children.  &quot;If  This Goes On -&quot; tells the story of John Lyle, a young legate in the  temple guard of the army of the Prophet, head of the religious organization  that has seized control of America's government.  Lyle becomes enamored of  Sister Judith, one of the Virgins of the Lord who personally serve the  Prophet, and quickly becomes disillusioned with the politicking and  corruption he discovers is commonplace there.  He and his roommate, the  cynical Zebediah Jones, soon find themselves embroiled in a plot to  overthrow the Prophet himself.  This story features plenty of action and  suspense, as well as Heinlein's usual expertise in all matters military.  The notion that American democracy might someday fall to religious fanatics  is a powerful one, and provides a bold backdrop for Lyle's adventures.  The  short stories &quot;Coventry&quot; and &quot;Misfit&quot; serve to make the  transition to the more mature civilization described in Methuselah's  Children.  This novel focuses on Lazarus Long of the Howard Families, a  group which has for some generations been breeding for longevity, (i.e.,  longer lives).  As a result, members of the Howards' bloodlines live nearly  double the average expected life span.  Having kept their existence secret  for over a century, the Howards choose to make themselves known to the rest  of humanity, with dire consequences.  Only through the quick actions of  Lazarus Long, the oldest living Howard, are the families able to escape  with their lives, and try to find a new home among the stars.  Lazarus Long  is very significant in Heinlein's oeuvre, being featured prominently in the  sexually charged Time Enough for Love among others.  In fact, it can be  argued that towards the end of his career, Heinlein himself began to  identify very closely with Lazarus Long.  In any case, Long is a wonderful  creation - tough, crotchety, smart, but not super-smart, capable,  confident, always ready for trouble, but never looking for it, sometimes  crude, but always gallant with ladies, always looking out for number one,  but not afraid to stand up for innocents when the odds merit the attempt -  this is the Lazarus Long that Heinlein fans know and love.  This book is an  absolute must for Heinlein fans, and a fine selection for science fiction  readers who are more interested in social patterns than in physics and  engineering.he  sexually charged Time Enough for Love among others.

Clarke.  Only one piece of fiction is included: the short short &quot;When the Twerms  Came&quot; which could be considered clever, perhaps even cute, but hardly  memorable.  Not surprisingly, most of the offerings deal with space, or  space travel, or predictions about future technological developments (many  of which involve space and space travel), with the predictable result that  as one gets further into the book, the essays begin to have a vague  familiarity about them.  Moreover, this volume closes with a piece written  in 1977, so most of the collection is 25 years old or older; as a result,  much of this material is sorely dated, although Clarke tries to rectify  this by revisiting each subject in his introductions.  All that aside, it's  probably safe to say that the essay is not really Clarke's strong suit.  His greatest gifts are his encyclopedic knowledge of science and its  history, his almost poetic descriptions of nature, and his rarely seen but  always pointed sense of humor.  Many of these pieces demonstrate the first  of these qualities, but very few take advantage of the latter two, much to  the book's detriment.  Clarke is at his most eloquent when describing his  adopted country, Sri Lanka, (once known as Serendip, thus the title), or  when he's discussing his passion for the world under the sea.  So much of  Clarke's work is borderline philosophical that he rarely indulges himself  in humor, but when he does, he is usually very effective with it.  (Does  anyone remember his Tales from the White Hart?  A classic of science  fiction humor.)  In this volume, he pokes fun at his competition in  &quot;Introducing Isaac Asimov&quot; and gives a fascinating account of  life in Sri Lanka in &quot;Servant Problem - Oriental Style&quot;, but the  rest of the book is pretty dry reading.  Even die-hard fans of Clarke's  work will find very little to get excited about in this one.find very little to get excited about in this one.	2000-07-29

Most of them appear in the collection The Green Hills of Earth, so this book is not for Heinlein's fans (who have probably  read these stories before), but for those who are just discovering his  fiction.  Unfortunately, this book is not really perfect for that purpose  either, since many of these stories are not representative of his best  work.  &quot;The Black Pits of Luna&quot; and &quot;It's Great to Be  Back&quot; are both swimming in misanthropy (if Heinlein likes you, you're  a hero, but if he doesn't, you're no more than vermin).  &quot;Searchlight&quot; features a painfully contrived scenario for a moon  rescue (if you happen to be blind but have perfect pitch), while &quot;We  Also Walk Dogs&quot; is plain silly (&quot;We need a device that can  control gravity - and oh, you only have ninety days to do it&quot;).  One  could say that &quot;Ordeal in Space&quot; is about a man who survives  terrible danger and is almost ruined by the experience, but one could also  say it's the story of an acrophobe who rescues a kitten from a window ledge  - as much ado about nothing as Heinlein ever wrote.  All of which is not to  say that these stories aren't enjoyable reading, and certainly the gradual  development of new technology and social forms (usually taking place in the  background) is fascinating to watch, but too often Heinlein's characters  are so annoying that the reader is almost tempted to root against them.  Only the anti-slavery &quot;Logic of Empire&quot; and the revolutionary  &quot;If This Goes On-&quot; are really effective, perhaps because the  social issues they speak to give a more meaningful context to the stories  of otherwise unremarkable individuals.  &quot;If This Goes On-&quot; is by  far the longest and strongest story in this volume, but it's also the  centerpiece of Revolt in 2100, which would be a far better selection for  readers just getting to know Heinlein's work.o know Heinlein's work.	2000-07-27

Hard science is probably Niven's biggest strength, and  his most effective strategy involves assuming some distinct technological  breakthrough, then working out all the physical limitations and social  ramifications that said breakthrough implies.  For example in  &quot;Rammer,&quot; the design of the ramjet is interesting, but the clever  way it's used to escape a global tyranny is even more fascinating.  Still  more attractive is the idea of the &quot;displacement booths&quot; which  allow instant transportation from one booth to another.  Niven discusses  the exciting possibilities of this technology, particularly its application  to criminal activities (&quot;The Alibi Machine&quot;, &quot;A Kind of  Murder&quot;, and the Runyan-esque &quot;The Last Days of the Permanent  Floating Riot Club&quot;), but also in reference to an otherwise impossible  space rescue in &quot;All the Bridges Rusting&quot;. &quot;There Is a  Tide&quot; features space traveler Louis Wu and an unusual death trap;  &quot;The Hole Man&quot; shows two scientists in conflict over the  possibility of a quantum black hole, until one of them decides to end the  argument once and for all, and &quot;The Fourth Profession&quot; is a  memorable tale of a bartender who takes some alien learning pills.  Since  each story has a solution based on technical data described in the  exposition, the reader can try to match wits with the hero, just as in  mystery yarns, but be forewarned - Niven has obviously thought long and  hard about the various possibilities, while the reader probably hasn't.  Meanwhile, there are some fairly good characters, too; the stubborn ramjet  pilot, the jaunty criminals, and the concerned bartender all find  themselves put upon by society, but they all find their own ways to get  what they feel they deserve. &quot;Bigger Than Worlds&quot; is Niven  stripped down to the essentials - no characters, no plot, just a  fascinating speculative essay describing various types of  &quot;super-planetary&quot; artifacts that (human) beings might just  possibly live on someday.  Niven isn't shy about his background in  mathematics, and much of the book deals with physics and/or astronomy, so  readers who are math-phobic probably won't find this book as entertaining  as some of his more fantastic speculations, but fans of hard science  fiction will definitely want to check this one out.igger Than Worlds&quot; is Niven  stripped down to the essentials - no characters, no plot, just a  fascinating speculative essay describing various types of  &quot;super-planetary&quot; artifacts that (human) beings might just  possibly live on someday.

The protagonists are both young men whose dissatisfaction with the stagnation of their respective societies leads  them on quests for change and growth; one visits the legendary Comarre, and  the other finds his destiny in the stars.  &quot;The Lion of Comarre&quot;  is a longish short story featuring Richard Peyton III, a young man who,  much to the dismay of his illustrious family, loves gadgets - a waste,  since his society believes that everything that can be invented already has  been.  Having bigger dreams, however, he goes off to find the secret of the  legendary Comarre, a self-contained city built by a long-dead ancestor.  With the help of an amicable lion, he overcomes the dangers of the citadel,  and discovers its long-buried secrets.  &quot;Against the Fall of  Night&quot; is closer to a short novel, and was actually rewritten by  Clarke as the novel The City and the Stars.  In this story, Alvin feels  trapped in the isolated tower city of Diaspar, the last great refuge on  Earth. Its inhabitants possess immortality, but are still constrained by  their fear of the world outside.  Alvin does not share their fear and finds  his way to the previously unknown city of Lys, where life is short, but  people have mastered the art of telepathy.  Alvin continues to make more  discoveries, finally revealing secrets that rewrite the history of  humanity, and eventually point to the stars.  There are plenty of  interesting ideas thrown around in these two stories, although in neither  case does Clarke develop them as fully as he perhaps should have.  Both  characters are flat, uninteresting, mere charicatures of inquisitive young  men.  As such the shorter &quot;Lion&quot; works better, since it tries to  do less and has a tighter plot.  &quot;Night&quot; has very little more  substance to it story-wise, since it's just the same &quot;discovery&quot;  plot over and over as new wonders are uncovered.  As to the wonders  themselves, they're clearly intended to be the stars of the show; but to  today's readers, intelligent machines and underground transport centers may  seem like pretty standard sci-fi fare.  This book is recommended for  younger readers just discovering science fiction, since there is no  exclusively adult content, but more experienced readers will probably want  something meatier.and over as new wonders are uncovered.

The basic concept  was not so astounding - every work of fiction attempts to be  self-consistent - but the sheer scope of Heinlein's vision was captivating  in itself, as readers watched human civilization struggle and grow to  maturity.  Sadly, this first installment of the series is not really the  strongest, so it's little wonder if the unconverted find themselves  wondering what all the excitement is about. There are a couple of modest  shorter works, but the main showpieces of the book are &quot;The Roads Must  Roll&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Sold the Moon.&quot;  In &quot;Roads&quot;  Heinlein presents us with a transportation revolution - state-spanning  conveyer belts that move commuters and freight at speeds up to one hundred  miles per hour.  To maintain this essential service, Heinlein imagines a  quasi-military organization of engineers who are trained as cadets to have  the same loyalty and self-discipline as graduates of West Point or  Annapolis, and this story emphasizes the organization almost as much as the  technology.  Indeed, the main crisis of the story is as much sociological  as technological, so readers can appreciate the story's conclusion without  trying to understand the engineering.  This story describes social needs,  technological solutions, and exciting action each in sufficient amounts to  achieve a solid result.  Unfortunately, the main story in the collection,  &quot;The Man Who Sold the Moon,&quot; is neither as credible nor as  entertaining.  The protagonist, D. D. Harriman, is a wealthy business  tycoon who is obsessed with the idea of going to the moon, a dream for  which he winds up risking everything.  There's not much science in this  long story; it mainly describes the conniving, underhanded shenanigans that  Harriman uses to finance his project.  Heinlein enjoys telling this kind of  story, and it certainly stands out as an unusual plot line for science  fiction, but the fact is that watching Harriman cheat his partners, shunt  off his wife, manipulate board meetings, finagle commercial endorsements,  etc., is a poor substitute for action, adventure, and engaging characters.  While this story may in fact describe how things get done in the real  world, (I, for one, doubt it), it's about as entertaining as watching  C-SPAN.  Overall, this book is not Heinlein's best, but serious fans of  science fiction may wish to read it as an introduction to the rest of  Heinlein's work.cribes the conniving, underhanded shenanigans that  Harriman uses to finance his project.

Bradbury is often pigeon-holed as a science fiction writer, because of the  enormous popular success of his futuristic novel Fahrenheit 451 and the  excellent short story collection The Martian Chronicles, but much of his  work  transcends science fiction and fantasy altogether.  In this  collection (as with several others), Bradbury shows us his more human side,  with offerings that range from the fantastic to the everyday, but always  with the emphasis on people, and how they react to the sometimes difficult  situations they find themselves in.  There are a couple good science  fiction yarns, including &quot;The One Who Waits&quot; with its menacing  feel, and the casually apocalyptic &quot;Boys! Raise Giant Mushrooms in  Your Cellar!&quot; but even these feature protagonists who are nothing like  the standard types.  Unlike the driven loners who populate many works of  science fiction, Bradbury's characters are members of families, visit with  friends, and even play active parts in their communities.  Bradbury chooses  to make his characters human not with cruelty and vulgarity, but with  compassion and simplicity, as in &quot;The Beggar on O'Connell  Bridge.&quot;  Bradbury narrates in a muted tone, making the reader listen  closely to hear him; his stories are quieter than perhaps any modern  writer's.  Into this reverent hush, he places small nuggets of story,  sometimes with very little action, or with the action delineated, but not  actually taking place within the story, such as the quiet evening before  the battle in &quot;The Drummer Boy of Shiloh.&quot; Some of the stories  are almost like prose poems, extolling the wonders of nature, as in &quot;A  Miracle of Rare Device&quot; or offering subtle social commentary, as in  &quot;Almost the End of the World.&quot;  As such, Bradbury is not for  everyone; action-lovers may find his work boring or even frustrating, and  fans of science fiction and fantasy will discover that much of his work is  both reality-based and non-scientific.  Instead, he searches out some  obscure corner of personal morality, and asks us to accept it for what it  is.  Bradbury believes in the essential goodness of human beings, despite  their occasional lapses, and makes us feel good to be part of the human  race.  He is willing to forgive humanity its foibles, and hopes with us for  a better tomorrow.  For today, that seems cause enough for joy.rs may find his work boring or even frustrating, and  fans of science fiction and fantasy will discover that much of his work is  both reality-based and non-scientific.

The protagonist (one certainly can't call him a hero) is  Jack Cull, an agent of an investigative agency known as the Exchange.  Amidst this living horror where no one seems to know any essential facts of  existence, the Exchange seeks out information concerning the possibility of  eternal salvation, or failing that, any rumors that might suffice to give  some hope to the long-suffering inhabitants.  Of primary concern is the  mysterious being known only as &quot;X&quot;, who appears to collect the  bodies of the deceased, delivers a cryptic moral message to any bystanders,  and then retires to engineer the resurrection of the dead.  Thus death does  not end, but only interrupts, the tedious existence of these god-forsaken  creatures.  Without giving away the many unique twists this story presents,  Farmer gives us an extensive tour of the premises, a confrontation with X,  and a major cataclysm, all within this rather short novel.  This adds up to  a book packed full of action, and brimming with radical, even bizarre,  cosmological ideas.  The characters, setting, and violent action are  uniformly grim, depressing, only half-familiar, and often morally  repugnant; all of which contribute to making this book an artistic success  as a view of a world without any moral compass or any real hope of  redemption.  Regrettably, these same qualities make the book a rather  depressing read, as the hopelessness and despair of the characters tends to  bleed over onto the reader.  Things happen so quickly that it's often hard  to understand exactly what's going on, and of course no one ever  understands why (they aren't supposed to, until the very end), keeping the  reader more befuddled than engrossed.  The conclusion of the novel, where  the secrets are revealed, is certainly surprising enough, although like  most theories of cosmology it may offend those with strict ideas about the  nature of the universe, and it certainly is of no practical importance even  if one believed in it.  All in all, readers who are neither offended nor  depressed by Farmer's vision may find it both clever and even amusing,  although no one's life will ever be changed by it.  But in the last  analysis, though Farmer has done a magnificent job of integrating every  facet of his novel to create a perfect picture of soulless emptiness, as  with the artist who fills jars with urine, it's hard to believe that many  people will actually enjoy the result.heories of cosmology it may offend those with strict ideas about the  nature of the universe, and it certainly is of no practical importance even  if one believed in it.

The acknowledged master of juvenile science fiction isn't really at his best here, but longtime fans will certainly enjoy this sample of his  work.  After winning a used space suit in a contest, young Kip Russel is  not long in finding a use for it, as bizarre coincidences and intergalactic  invaders conspire to take him on a wild adventure to the Moon, Pluto, and  beyond.  Kip has just graduated from high school (a favorite age for the  hero of a juvenile) and is trying to figure out how to pay for college,  when he is captured in his own backyard by extraterrestrials.  He meets a  fellow prisoner, Peewee, who is a very typical Heinlein grrl: boyishly  skinny, terribly spoiled, and absurdly intelligent.  Despite her genius IQ,  however, it always seems to come down to Kip's courage, determination, and  perhaps most of all, his suit, to save the day.  Heinlein takes great pains  to describe the suit in loving detail, explaining the repairs needed to  make it serviceable, how the various controls work and why they're needed,  what manner of improvements Kip made to the design and why and how he paid  for them, what sort of items were supposed to be kept in it and how he  obtained them, or what he used in their place, etc... Of course this novel  was written well before the development of modern space gear, and there's  no doubt that some of Heinlein's suggestions were considered by the  scientists who designed the real article; but for today's young readers, a  space suit is probably a lot less interesting in and of itself than  Heinlein makes it out to be.  This book seems long for a juvenile, too,  although things move fairly quickly except for a few slow patches: Kip's  wearying moon trek, his very tedious imprisonment, and the whole last third  of the book, after the real action is already over.  More tellingly, the  story is packed with melodramatic unpleasantness, as Kip and Peewee seem to  be constantly near death or worse.  Perhaps Heinlein thought that younger  readers wouldn't see just how far over the top he was going with this book,  but for a more realistic look at the dangers and discomforts of space  travel, read his survival epic Tunnel in the Sky, or the superb colonial  novel, Farmer in the Sky.  Like so many of Heinlein's gems from  mid-century, this book works better for readers who were kids in 1950 than  for those who are kids today.e seem to  be constantly near death or worse.

Baum's beloved Oz  books.  Whether such a thing should actually have been attempted is clearly  a matter of taste, but it seems likely that fans of the Baum books who also  enjoy science fiction will find this novel an amusing blend of wild fantasy  and desperate rationalization.  The hero is Hank Stover, a World War I  veteran flier and barnstormer (and coincidentally, son of the legendary  Dorothy), who flies his Jenny (a Curtiss JN-4H biplane) into a mysterious  emerald haze and comes out in the wonderland described by his mother many  years before.  As might be expected, Farmer has to go to considerable  lengths to explain the world of Oz, with its talking animals, sentient  objects, warring witches, and diminutive inhabitants.  He makes some  &quot;corrections&quot; to the original Oz books, changes that he asserts  Baum made in order to conform to the mores of the age, or the needs of the  narrative, or even simple disbelief at Dorothy's eyewitness account.  Even  given these points, though, Farmer has to resort to some very shaky  scientific assumptions, and there are many points which he simply has to  call &quot;magic&quot;, i.e., the result of a technology that is far beyond  ours.  Unfortunately, the biggest weakness of this novel is not the  science, but the matter-of-fact way that Farmer relates this science  fiction take on a classic fantasy -- with very little wonder and a minimum  of enthusiasm.  Instead, we get a straight-ahead action/adventure without  any trace of humor or irony.  By constantly trying to explain the  principles behind the marvels, he robs the story of its magic (not  literally, but emotionally), and by focusing on conflicts between Oz'  various factions, he eliminates most of the fun as well.  There's plenty of  action and some interesting battle scenes, including one between two  witches, and a fateful altercation between Glinda the Good and President  Harding, but most of this book is pretty standard modern-meets-medieval  stuff.  Lacking the joy and innocent wonder of Baum's stories, this book  seems destined to please readers who loved the Oz books as children, but  outgrew them and turned to science fiction instead.

Clarke should be wary of Glide Path, a departure from his usually excellent science fiction fare.

The hero is Flying Officer  Alan Bishop, a trainer with experience in radio and radar, but not much  else.  Through Bishop's eyes we meet the scientists, engineers, and RAF  officers whose combined talents were responsible for this valuable  life-saving tool.  The science is admittedly well out of date, but Clarke's  real focus is not on the physics but on the human elements: Dr. Hatton, a  biologist who sees the application that the physicists don't, Professor  Schuster, the theoretical genius who designs the whole system but doesn't  understand a voltage adapter, Flight Lieutenant Collins, whose upper-class  dress and manners inspire nothing but derision, and especially Bishop, who  talks down hundreds of pilots but has never flown himself.  Clarke tries to  fill out Bishop's story with scenes from his personal life, showing us his  relationships with his father, his governess, and his lady friend, as well  as his fellow officers, but in the tradition of British reserve, these  chapters come off rather flat.  He succeeds in fleshing out Bishop's  character, but generally fails to endear him to the reader.  Perhaps the  real problem is that by focusing on Bishop the Everyman, he condemns his  story to be equally mundane.  Since so much of this book is about Bishop  (it could be argued that this novel is his coming-of-age story), and only  tangentially about the technology, Clarke needed to make us interested in  Bishop's fate.  By the novel's conclusion, though, we recognize that  relatively little has actually happened to him.  While clearly some  character development takes place over the course of the novel, there is  nothing especially suspenseful or even interesting about Bishop's progress  into manhood.  If the essence of a story is conflict, whom may we say  Bishop is in conflict with?  We get only the briefest of hints that there's  actually an enemy out there.  The best moments are the talk-down landings,  where Bishop defies Nature and himself trying to do what was once thought  impossible, but many more such moments would have been needed to make this  book a real success. Instead this book is a pleasant piece of historical  fiction, but it isn't meaty enough to be taken as seriously as Clarke  perhaps intended it.ally suspenseful or even interesting about Bishop's progress  into manhood.

By its very nature, a science fiction story should attempt to give a rational explanation of how things are possible, while in the realm of fantasy, such explanations are dispensed with in order to pursue goals other than credibility (ie., a moral lesson, or at the very least, an exciting entertainment). The common theme of the collection is the untapped potential of the human animal, and exactly what it means to be human, but Heinlein doesn't have any specific answers or agenda, leaving the readers to decide for themselves.<br />&quot;Gulf&quot; is the most exciting and realistic of the offerings, a spy thriller replete with secret organizations, evil geniuses, and doomsday weapons. The hero finds himself recruited by an organization of self-proclaimed &quot;supermen&quot; who set about trying to contain the evil forces loose in their not-too-futuristic society. Rather disappointingly, Heinlein chooses not to discuss the serious moral implications of this group, focusing instead on their training, methods, and ideals. Ultimately however, the reader may be repelled by the fascist notion that a group can consider itself so superior to the run of humanity that it can act outside the law, even though they claim to be acting for the greater good. Moral qualms aside, this is a fast-paced and exciting adventure, although the ending is rather too abrupt.  &quot;Elsewhen&quot; is a wild fantasy wherein a college professor teaches some students how to use hypnosis to travel to different &quot;realities&quot;. The students' adventures aren't all that exceptional, but the story is at least fairly well constructed. In &quot;Lost Legacy&quot;, three academians unlock the hidden potentials of the human mind, but have to fight to get the world to listen. Unlike the supermen of &quot;Gulf&quot; and the ivory-tower theoreticians of &quot;Elsewhen&quot;, these heroes want to spread their knowledge in order to benefit mankind. Unfortunately they find themselves stymied by widespread skepticism. (In Heinlein's Engineer's philosophy, unwillingness to believe the evidence of one's senses is a cardinal sin). More portentously, certain sinister forces have their own reasons for wanting these discoveries kept secret. This story could have moved a bit faster, but it's not a bad effort. The final offering, &quot;Jerry Was a Man&quot;, tells the story of a genetically modified primate and the wealthy socialite who wants to secure him his rights as a &quot;man&quot;. The fact that Jerry is really just an overly intelligent chimp makes this difficult, but not impossible, and allows Heinlein to indulge in his predilections for courtroom drama, legal shystering, and back room political maneuvering. Unfortunately, this upstages the perhaps more interesting technical aspects of genetic engineering, (which in all fairness to Heinlein was in its infancy when the story was written), and more importantly, the moral ramifications and sociological consequences of giving &quot;human rights&quot; to species other than homo sapiens.<br />Overall, Heinlein raises some interesting questions with this collection, but takes the easy way out by ducking any conclusions. Fantasy fans who aren't looking for great revelations will probably enjoy this book, but the average science fiction reader will likely be disappointed.vory-tower theoreticians of &quot;Elsewhen&quot;, these heroes want to spread their knowledge in order to benefit mankind.

Heinlein recounts the rags-to-riches story of Maxwell Jones, born  to a poor dirt farmer, but destined to pilot the glorious vessels that  travel the stars.  Leaving behind his callous stepfather and uncaring  stepmother, Max hooks up with a world-wise drifter whose conniving gets  them work aboard a spaceship. The series of events that follow make for a  fascinating story as Max ponders his options: should he climb the ranks  while hiding his secret past, or plan his escape to a new life on a new  planet?  Meanwhile, Heinlein introduces us to the ship's memorable company,  and describes the ship's organization with captivating detail.  While  working as a steward's mate, Max befriends a wealthy passenger named Ellie,  who is attracted by his honesty and naivet&eacute;.  Ellie is a fairly typical  Heinlein grrl: cute, friendly, but tougher than she looks, used to getting  her own way, and disinclined to let others know just how smart she really  is.  Ellie uses her wealth and position to get Max a chance at a promotion,  and his natural gifts take him the rest of the way.  While Max's rise from  farmer to steward's mate to chartsman, etc. may seem excessive, and  certainly fraught with coincidences, Heinlein wants to show an example of  how persistence, hard work, and a willingness to take risks can pay big  dividends.  Moreover, when Max breaks the rules, he winds up paying for it,  and becomes a man in the process, just as Sam winds up paying dearly for  his mistakes.  Max and Sam play off each other wonderfully, and keep the  reader interested in their story.  There are some exciting adventures on an  uncharted planet, and plenty of suspense involving the science of  astrogation.  The science in this novel hasn't aged very well--Heinlein  puts astrogational computers on board, but still requires human beings to  do most of the mathematics -- but his knowledge of ship's hierarchy and  routine give this book a closeness to life that many such novels lack.  Above all, Heinlein is telling a morality tale, and the very skill with  which he recounts his story makes it convincing.of the mathematics -- but his knowledge of ship's hierarchy and  routine give this book a closeness to life that many such novels lack.

US	49836087	R23WPTGKCASF43	0345353110	44414098	Space Cadet	Books	3	1	3	N	N	Solid, but Uninspiring	Space Cadet is the story of Matt Dodson's training in the Space Patrol, a kind of peacekeeping force which serves the solar system as a &quot;repository of weapons too dangerous to use.&quot;  Heinlein cleverly  points out the limitations of America's &quot;current&quot; (1949) military  strategy, and shows how he would handle the disposition of weapons of mass  destruction.  Asked why he wants to become a Patrolman, Matt grudgingly  admits that &quot;people look up to an officer of the Patrol.&quot;  The  Patrol is composed entirely of officers, all of them volunteers, all of  whom go through the same rigorous and at times almost sadistic elimination  process Matt does.  Besides grueling physical tests, an extensive battery  of psychological and intellectual exams are used to narrow down the pool of  candidates.  There is a strong emphasis on education, moral responsibility,  and esprit de corps.  Heinlein does a good job of describing the Patrol and  its ideals, the painful rigors of training, and a cadet's first experiences  with space flight, zero gravity, and spacesickness.  Heinlein shows his  open-mindedness when our heroes are stranded on Venus, where the natives  are friendly, collie-like creatures (all of them female) with their own  language, their own traditions and taboos, and a command of technology that  is both radically different from and superior to our own.  On the other  hand, human females are almost totally ignored (there are none in the  Patrol). Characters come and go, as is typical of the service, with no more  development than might be expected within so short a time period, but the  focus is on the process of training cadets, rather than on the cadets'  growth as individuals.  Matt himself is engaging enough, as is his friend  Tex, whose tall tales provide a touch of folksy humor, but roommates Oscar  and Pete come off as little more than stuffed shirts.  There's not a lot of  slam-bang excitement, either; the conflict is largely internal as the  cadets struggle to be all they can be in a generally peaceful social order.  Absent the rabid militarism of the better-known Starship Troopers, this  book is a pleasant, enjoyable diversion for young readers, but offers  little in the way of big surprises, spine-tingling adventure, or even  abstruse science. In the final analysis, Heinlein takes so few risks with  this story that it fails to reach the heights of adventure and speculation  that we look for in such a book.  Teenage boys should enjoy this novel, but  it's doubtful that they'll remember it very long.as the  cadets struggle to be all they can be in a generally peaceful social order.

US	49836087	R30WSZ9BM39C70	0345321421	103702742	Limits	Books	3	3	4	N	N	More help needed	Limits is a modest collection of science fiction and fantasystories from Larry Niven.  Although he has some interesting ideas,it's clear that the short story format is not really Niven's forte. Indeed, the strongest pieces in this volume are those written in collaboration with other writers.  Among the fantasies, for example, the mystical feel of &quot;Talisman&quot; (written with Dian Girard) is far more effective than the humdrum restaurant setting of the wholly forgettable &quot;Lion in the Attic&quot;.  In the former, a beautiful young thief matches wits with crafty magicians to try and find a legendary treasure, while in the latter, a restaurant owner hides a secret from some mysterious travelers.  And while &quot;Talisman&quot; draws us in with its subtle characterization and constant movement, &quot;Lion&quot; keeps its secrets until the end, by which time the reader has lost interest in the outcome.  Niven gets plenty of help from his collaborators in the science fiction vein as well.  &quot;Spirals&quot;, with Jerry Pournelle, is an inside look at how space mining began in the asteroid belt, wherein the reader discovers that the main characters, who are later lauded as heroes, were actually very flawed human beings, who acted from the basest and most primitive of motives.  In the moving story &quot;The Locusts&quot;, written with Steven Barnes, a group of bright, strong and energetic colonials deal with the discovery that their efforts are doomed.  The heroes' plight is portrayed with understated drama and a fair amount of realism to make for an unforgettable tale.  In both of these stories, the authors emphasize the essential humanity of their characters (despite the science fiction trappings), and this is what gives their stories such a powerful impact.  When Niven is on his own, however, he sometimes loses sight of this simple principle.  &quot;A Teardrop Falls&quot; is a Berserker story, for fans of such, and shows how a machine cleverly tricks another machine. Without any emotional attachment, the story hinges on the cleverness of the trick, which in this case is no big deal.  &quot;Flare Time&quot; deals with adventure on another planet, and has some entertaining features, but tends to be a little unfocused.  Niven tries to do too much with this story, introducing new species, an entire series of new environments, etc., and would have been better off writing a short novel that used the same characters and locale.  As it is, the reader is rushed through the journey too quickly to appreciate Niven's many inventions. Rounding out the collection are the chirpsithtra shorts, which feature Niven's tall-tale-telling aliens spinning yarns in a spaceport bar. Chirpthistra stories are meant to be amusing, but occasionally Niven slips some serious ideas in as well.  Of these, &quot;War Movie&quot; has the most interesting payoff, while &quot;Folk Tale&quot; falls so flat one can almost hear the thud.  All in all not a bad collection, but still nothing like the quality we find in Niven's better novels.machine.

US	49836087	R2VEC4KKE0FJYU	0812508890	322809458	Dayworld Breakup (Dayworld Trilogy, III)	Books	3	14	14	N	N	Tons of action, few new ideas	Philip Jose Farmer's Dayworld Breakup is the conclusion of a trilogy begun by Dayworld and continued in Dayworld Rebel. In the classic Dayworld, Farmer describes a world where the population problem has been solved by allowing each person to only live one day a week; they spend the rest of the week as stone statues in &quot;stoning booths&quot;, using no resources and taking up minimal space. In Dayworld Rebel, Farmer describes an effort to overthrow the Dayworld system. Dayworld Breakup takes up where Rebel left off, with hero Jefferson Caird on the roof of the apartment tower where he has just forced World Councilor Ananda to broadcast the truth to the residents of Dayworld. What follows is a high-speed thrill ride of chase scenes, narrow escapes, shoot-outs, hostage-taking, and wanton destruction as Caird and his trusted female companion Panthea Snick try to outwit the law and take over an underground organization. Unfortunately, the climax, where they chain themselves to the gorgonized body of Dayworld's organizer in the central plaza, is a considerable disappointment. The remaining third of the novel is rather slower, and considerably less interesting. The characters will already be familiar to readers of the Dayworld novels, but they are neither especially engaging nor particularly realistic. This isn't a problem during the slam-bang action sequences, but during the last third of the book, where the story turns psychological (again), it undercuts the reader's ability to care about the hero's condition. There's plenty of technology to interest science fiction readers, but don't expect to learn anything useful from this book. Farmer's pseudo-science is too far out to be of much practical interest. In the last analysis, Farmer's real strength is his imaginative ideas: a million-mile river populated by everyone who ever lived (Riverworld), a repressed man who falls in love with an alien insect (The Lovers), a future where people only live one day out of the week (Dayworld). But brilliant as the original concept behind Dayworld was, Dayworld Breakup has little to offer us in the way of ideas. Readers of the Dayworld series will want to read this book just to see how the story turns out (Dayworld Rebel just sort of stops in mid-stride), and science fiction fans who like plenty of action should be more than satisfied with this book. As for the rest... perhaps someday Farmer will write a series whose conclusion is equal to the promise of its beginning, but this isn't the one.Dayworld).

US	49836087	R3THMR7YWBQC6A	0345330153	504990077	Waldo & Magic, Inc.	Books	3	12	14	N	N	Fantasy for Heinlein Fans	Two of Heinlein's early foray's into fantasy are packaged together in this book.  Of the two, &quot;Waldo&quot;, with its unique blending of science fiction and fantasy, is much the stronger.  The title character, Waldo Farthingwaite-Jones, is a misanthropic young genius who lives in an  isolated, gravity-free environment, which he has specially designed to help  him overcome his physical challenges.  Heinlein makes Waldo's residence and  the myriad gadgets in it both believable and fascinating.  Almost as  interesting is the development of Waldo's personality, as he changes from a  rude, temperamental victim, to a strong, self-confident performer.  All  this by itself might have made for a first-rate science fiction story, but  Heinlein has other ideas.  His main plot device is a very typical science  fiction ploy: Waldo has to fix a problem with some recalcitrant machinery.  But the solution Waldo finds is supernatural rather than mechanical, and so  the story strays into the realm of fantasy.  Of course Heinlein has a very  good reason for this; the whole point of his story is to dramatize one of  his favorite themes, to wit, that when one's deepest-held convictions don't  agree with the facts, one must have the courage to change those  convictions.  This might be referred to as the Engineer's Creed, and it  shows up frequently in Heinlein's work, but this is one of few stories  based on it specifically.  In this instance, Waldo manages to accept that  the impossible is true, and not only solve the technical problem, but solve  his personal problems, too.  Unfortunately, his answers are so easy that  they counteract any emotional impact that the story might have had.  From a  conceptual standpoint, Heinlein's meld of science fiction and fantasy may  have a valid purpose, but in practice, the average reader may find the  story's resolution disappointing, while fans of hard science fiction may  feel cheated by a problem that has no reasonable solution.  &quot;Magic,  Inc.&quot; is less ambitious, being nothing more than a total fantasy.  Heinlein describes a world where magic is a commonly used commodity,  although still the province of specialists, and the no-nonsense businessman  who narrates the tale gives a breezy reality to magic's various economic,  legal, and political ramifications.  Other than that, however, the story  seems to have little enough to recommend it.  Characters come and go with  no real development, and many of them are so close to being ethnic and/or  racial stereotypes that some of today's reader might take offense. Overall,  both stories are pleasant little diversions, but fans of fantasy should not  expect any great revelations, while science fiction fans will find  relatively little substance.

US	49836087	R2IHV8HMEFZN9F	0345336607	829960059	Rocket Ship Galileo	Books	2	5	12	N	N	Too tame for the 21st Century	A daring young atomic scientist teams up with three high school seniors to attempt the first-ever rocket trip to the moon -- that's the premise of Heinlein's Rocket Ship Galileo.  Readers who aren't immediately turned off  by the story's wild improbabilities and dated subject matter might find  this book an entertaining adventure.  To begin with, Heinlein's story is  well paced and solidly constructed for once, a pleasant change from the  episodic hodgepodges he created in his later years.  He skillfully  introduces elements of conflict at an early stage of the story, (as  sinister forces seem to be trying to prevent the voyage from taking place)  and he even manages to build some suspense, an effect Heinlein is not  usually noted for.  His descriptions of the mechanics of the moon rocket  and its voyage are both convincing and interesting, despite being badly  dated.  The real letdown is the characters, who are curiously undeveloped,  even for science fiction.  The three boys themselves are virtually  interchangeable, and Doctor Cargraves isn't much more distinctive.  If some  attempt had been made to give these young men their own individual  personalities, the readers might find them easier to identify with.  As it  is, it's hard to really care about these characters, even when something  horrible happens to them.  The really big problem, though, is that this  book hasn't aged very well.  For example, Heinlein tries to show us how a  moon rocket was outfitted and launched privately, by one scientist and his  youthful helpers, working on a shoestring budget, after a few months of  labor; when after all, any schoolchild knows that it took NASA and the U.S.  government billions of dollars, working with hundreds of the finest minds  on the planet for nearly a decade, to accomplish the real thing.  Once our  heroes reach the moon, the story gets even more improbable, as they find  that the moon is already inhabited.  Naturally, Heinlein wrote this novel  for younger readers, and it was published at a time when space travel  seemed utterly impossible.  As such, it was written for the tastes of the  times, and times have changed dramatically.  For instance, the only women  in this book are the boys' mothers, who have very little to say about  anything important.  The villains are cartoonish stereotypes, who are  summarily dispatched without any show of remorse.  Although the book is  reasonably well-written overall, and older readers may take some nostalgic  pleasure in its simplicity and naivet&eacute;, today's young readers may expect  something more thrillingly speculative than a moon landing.  On average, if  you're old enough to remember Sputnik, you can be forgiven for loving this  book; but if Neil Armstrong is just another boring guy you heard about in  school, you probably won't be impressed by Rocket Ship Galileo.eaders, and it was published at a time when space travel  seemed utterly impossible.

It follows the space travels of Tom Bartlett, a young man who (much to his own surprise) shares a telepathic bond with his  earth-bound twin brother Pat.  Tom is a very realistic character, for  Heinlein, a quiet, practical person, who has spent most of his life  passively allowing his brother to manipulate him. Tom's gradual  comprehension of the nature of their relationship, and his subsequent  attempts to develop his own personality, make this an engaging story  without getting too intense for younger readers.  As might be expected of  so  psychological a novel, the pace is rather slow and very uneven.  Heinlein concentrates primarily on episodes that show Tom's emotional  development, rather than the &quot;landfall&quot; scenes which would be the  focus of a more traditional &quot;science fiction adventure&quot; novel.  The first few chapters give ample opportunity to see Pat in action; he  gleefully manipulates his parents, some helpful scientists, a major  research foundation, and of course, his brother Tom. Once Tom sets off to  explore the galaxy, he has to shake off his dependence on Pat, and become a  man in his own right.  Fortunately, he gets plenty of help from various  members of the crew, including the ship's doctor, and manages to learn from  his mistakes.  As the expedition runs into its own<br />difficulties, Tom has  to take on more and more responsibility.  Only by recognizing the  sacrifices others have made for human progress, and resolving to make the  best of his own situation,is he able to throw off the dead weight of the  past, and find hope for a brighter future. The later chapters seem rather  rushed, but Heinlein's endings are not always the strongest part of his  novels, and this one at least stands up as well as most.  Most importantly,  Heinlein loves to pontificate, and as Tom travels the stars in search of  himself, Heinlein takes the opportunity to expound on such diverse topics  as relativity, communications theory, the principles of space exploration  and ship's organization, and the uncertain nature of scientific fact in an  ever-changing universe.  His ability to make such material fascinating has  always been his real genius, and under-playing the action leaves him plenty  of room to go with his strength.  If you don't especially like reading  Heinlein's opinions on scientific and quasi-scientific subjects, you're  probably not a particular fan of his, and this novel won't change your  mind, but Heinlein's fans should find this a very enjoyable book.nd as Tom travels the stars in search of  himself, Heinlein takes the opportunity to expound on such diverse topics  as relativity, communications theory, the principles of space exploration  and ship's organization, and the uncertain nature of scientific fact in an  ever-changing universe.

His juveniles are fun, exciting romps, and his adult novelsare imaginative and deeply thought provoking.  On the down side, tight plotting is generally not his forte, and his characters, while exceptionally fresh and human by the standards of mid-twentieth century science fiction, may seem stiff and contrived today.  These facets of his work are usually glossed over, however, because it was Heinlein who put the social sciences into science fiction.  When most of the genre was interested in physics and astronomy, Heinlein was speculating about politics and sociology.  When the typical science fiction hero was solely interested in advancing human knowledge, Heinlein's heroes were trying to make money, or impress the ladies. Heinlein's characters ate, drank, slept, went to the bathroom, and worked at their jobs, just as many of us do in the real world.  Over time, other writers grasped that this kind of social realism made their characters easier to identify with, and gave their work a level of verisimilitude that had been lacking in science fiction from its beginnings.  All this notwithstanding, it must be admitted that Beyond this Horizon is a very poor book - quite possibly the worst novel Heinlein ever wrote.  The hero, Hamilton Felix, is a very common character in Heinlein's adult novels.  Tough-minded, super-capable, wisecracking, irreverent, and ostensibly likable, these characters sometimes seem a little too perfect to care about.  Here, Heinlein is not so much trying to describe a believable person as to show us his vision of the man of the future.  Not all of us are impressed. In matters of science, Heinlein's explanations of the fundamentals of genetic inheritance are neither particularly interesting nor particularly enlightening.  Most people learned this material in high school, and for that matter, the details aren't really that critical to the story anyway.  The latter third of the book takes a stab at solving the basic philosophical questions facing humanity, and the ease with which Heinlein knocks them off is nothing short of silly. The most interesting idea the novel presents us with is the vision of an armed populace casually walking the streets with guns at their side, ready to use deadly force to redress anything from a punch in the nose to an invasion of privacy.  Heinlein suggests that a more polite and respectful society would result, but later hedges his bet by questioning the practice. Absurd coincidences abound in this poorly plotted novel, many of them downright laughable.  The characters are not only unsympathetic; they are flat almost to transparency.  But the single most astonishing thing about this book is that it has so much in common with Heinlein's masterful Stranger in a Strange Land and yet still manages to be merely pathetic.  Students who are studying Heinlein's fiction may wish to compare this novel with his more successful works in order to see what went wrong, but I would not recommend it to anyone.es a stab at solving the basic philosophical questions facing humanity, and the ease with which Heinlein knocks them off is nothing short of silly.

US	49836087	R2XFT7PZRB0WNL	0345353730	2944439	Tunnel in the Sky	Books	4	11	12	N	N	A Young Man's Adventure on an Unknown Planet	Tunnel in the Sky is the most Naturalistic of Heinlein's juveniles, teaching some harsh lessons about death and survival.  The novel is the coming-of-age story of Rod, a student who is about to take the final exam  for &quot;Outworlds Survival&quot;, a class he must pass to achieve his  dream of becoming a planetary explorer.  Rod is one of Heinlein's most  likable characters: smart, compassionate, willing to listen, a natural  leader, but still human enough to have his faults, and inexperienced enough  to make plenty of mistakes.  Watching these mistakes and the price he pays  for them should be an exciting adventure for readers of all ages.  Admittedly, the plot is not very original, although something about  castaways in a hostile environment always captures the imagination.  Rod's  first night alone in the wilderness is especially well depicted. The book  isn't really that big on action, or even on science; but Heinlein provides  plenty of conflict, particularly once the students join<br />forces and  sociological issues come to the fore.  Heinlein has often been  criticized for his view of women, but this book goes a long way towards  refuting such charges.  First, the students are both male and female, and  the girls are granted absolutely no preference.  Heinlein wants us to see  that the laws of survival treat men and women as equals; it is only human  society that invents the differences.  Second, the female characters are  frequently shown to be both more capable and more practical than their male  classmates.  Caroline is as skilled a hunter as any two boys together, and  later proves herself an able administrator.  Jacqueline manages to preserve  the basic comforts of civilization while Rod has regressed to savagery.  And Rod's own sister is a professional warrior, veteran of countless  campaigns, and leader of her own platoon.  The fact that these women appear  as interested in getting married as in furthering their careers seems a  byproduct of Heinlein's conservatism, rather than misogyny.  And  conservative Heinlein certainly is, at least at this point in his career.  As the survival group becomes larger and more civilized, it becomes more  comfortable, more divided, and less vigilant in its own defense.  Once  Grant takes control of the group, political expediency makes pleasing his  constituents (ie., the newlyweds) more important than practical  considerations required for their safety (ie., the wall).  Heinlein clearly  feels that eternal vigilance is the price of survival.  The novel's  conclusion is fairly weak, especially the coincidence relating to Rod's  parents.  Perhaps Heinlein is trying to show that he understands how young  people can grow and mature without their parents noticing.  His advice to  them is to hang in there - it's worth it.  This book is a good, fast  read, and I enjoyed very much despite its flaws.  I would recommend it very  highly for younger fans of science fiction.  For readers who prefer hard  science, or who want complex characterization, or who have higher literary  expectations, this book may be less enjoyable.ein's conservatism, rather than misogyny.
