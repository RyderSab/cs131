Tolkien was the fist book that I read on my own as a child and it therefore holds a very special place in my heart. The story  is not just an adventure story filled with magic and strange and wonderous creatures. It tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf and the gang of dwarves (Thorin Oakenshield, Kili, and Fili to mention a few) and their amazing journey to find the treasure guarded by the evil and selfish dragon Smaug. The story is a tale of self discovery, maturity and shows how much Bilbo Baggins changes as a man from the start till the finish. The descriptions used in the book are splendid and the small songs included add allot to the story (something I did not appreciate or understand as a child). I love the narration and I would recommend this splendid tale to not just fantasy fans but to anyone that fancies a good book.	2005-09-30

Frank Baum is the last in the oz series that was written by Baum and is a splendid tale where we meet most of ourbeloved charachters like Ozma, Dorothy, Glinda, Jack Pumpkin, The Glass Cat and many other memorable ones. The story centers around Dorothy's and Ozmas attempt to avert a war between two tribes called the Flatheads and the Skeezers. The story takes many zany and crazy turns is a fitting conclusion to Baums oz series and I can not wait to read the rest of the oz books written by the other authors like Plumly Thompson and others.	2005-09-05

This time Ruggedo the ex-nome king once more is stirring up more trouble then ever before and he is assisted by Kiki Aru whom has learned a remarkable magic word. In this story we once more meet our favorite oz charachters like the cowardly lion, dorothy, ozma, and many others. The Magic of Oz is filled with exciting adventures, wonderfull thrills and has grand illustrations that capture the spirit and essence of the magical world of oz. I can not wait to read the last of Baums oz books and then continue with the rest of the oz books written by other authors.	2005-08-29

In this marvelous tale we get to meet all our favorite charachters from the previous tales like Ozma, Dorothy and get to meet some new and not all together pleasent folks like Mrs Joop and the nice Woot, the pig professor. The story line is not the best developed of the oz books but I still loved it and I think that Baum has created a series on par with the lord of rings and the narnia stories.	2005-08-29

Here is an all-star cast from the \\"olde\\" oz books and we get to follow Dorothy, Trot, Betsy Bobbin, Hank, the hungry lion and new friends like the frogman. The story is quite exciting and the plot is awesome with many twists and turns and the hunt for the lost ozma is thrilling and filled with marvelous adventures and I must say that it is one of the best book in the series so far.

The story centers on the adventures of Prince Inga of Pingaree and King Rinkitink of Gilgad and his talking goat Bilbil.

Yes it is true that we also read nothing about Dorothy, ozma or the the olde tyme charachters such as the cowardly lion, the tin man but the story is very well written and the plot is fabolous with strong charachter devlopment and fabulous illustrations as always.

I can not say enough good things about the patchwork girl since she is nice breath of fresh air in oz and her way of looking at things is quite refreshing and new to an otherwise quite stale mindset. This is a splendid series and I can not wait to read the next book.	2005-08-19

In this story we also get to meet \\"olde\\" favorites such as the tinman, the scarecrow, billina, the hungry tiger, ozma the princess and many other wonderfull charachters.

This is an awesome tale that teaches children morals and values without beating them over the head. Reading the story as an adult I can not truly see the hardship that Charlie has to suffer prior to coming to the factory and this is in itself is the hallmark of inteligent social commentary. I love the story and the illustrations and I consider this one of the better childrens stories of all time that can be read from ages 6-99.	2005-07-10

Carroll has managed to create memorable characters, the mad-hatter, Humpty Dumpty and many others. This is not merely a well-written children's story but a piece of biting satire and a violent attack on the norms, morals and ethics that were prevalent at the time. For instance when Humpty Dumpty shakes hands with Alice he only offers one finer. This was an extreme version of the upper class only offering two fingers to shake to anyone below their stature and he takes this nasty habit to its ugly extreme. The pictures are tremendously well done. I can not praise Caroll enough since he is one of the best writers of children's stories ever and the way he paints the landscape and his usage of the words is truly stupendous. Every time I read it there is something new I pick up and that I have not thought about before. This is the sign of marvelous talent and proves that he is one of the best authors and story tellers ever.	2005-06-08

To imagine that people did not learn anytghing from this is astounding since Rawanda, Bosnia and in Cambodia happened many years after.

It is true that many were jews, but there were countless others as well, Russian Pows, Jehovas Witness, Gypsies and many more. It was a brutal crime against humanity and showe mankinds worst traits.

It is very dry and he jumps all over the place with random dates seemingly. I find that he probably should have had a sterner editor that should have told him to organize the book a bit better since one does feel lost at times and some of the chapters talk about like absolutely nothing which is a \\"no no\\" for an author (like when he speculates about conjoned twins).

It seems as they become more and more famous, the chapters also become shorter. I was quite interested to read about the different equipment that they had used over the years and I was quite disapointed that the author had not made a comprehensive list of all keyboards used for each recording as this is quite intesting. I also found that it strange that their was so much material on Vince Clarke as he was only with them for one album. Alan Wilder must be a bit disapointed with the book as he is shown to be arrogant, filled with self importance.

It is quite painful to look at the photographs and see the evil that was done not all that long ago at all. The picture of a smiling Anne Frank on the cover is a shilling reminder that she was oblivious to the horrible future that lay ahead of her and her family. It is very tasking to think that the incident occurred just 30 years prior to my birth and it is now still only less then 100 years since this insidious incident happened.	2005-03-17
